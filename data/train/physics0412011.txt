    "the precise measurement and control of magnetic fields and field fluctuations is of crucial importance in many fundamental physics experiments .",
    "the suppression of systematic uncertainties in experiments searching for permanent electric dipole moments ( edms ) in atoms and neutrons is one prominent example .",
    "new generations of edm experiments with ultracold neutrons ( ucns ) aim at a higher statistical precision by the use of higher ucn flux and larger storage volumes . in such experiments magnetic field drifts and fluctuations can produce false edm signatures thereby putting stronger constraints on the magnetic field control .",
    "although magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) are the most sensitive magnetometers available to date they are of limited interest for monitoring magnetic fields in large volumes . moreover , squids do not measure absolute field values .",
    "two distinct magnetometric techniques were used in past edm experiments . in the ill experiment@xcite , which has produced the presently lowest upper bound on the neutron edm , a vapor of @xmath2hg atoms filled into the ultracold neutron storage chamber ( 20 liter ) served as `` cohabitating '' magnetometer .",
    "the pnpi experiment @xcite , on the other side , used a set of two self - oscillating cesium vapor magnetometers placed above and below the storage chamber for monitoring the field in the chamber .",
    "both techniques have pros and contras .",
    "co - magnetometers yield only a volume - averaged field value , which yields no information on field gradients and their fluctuations .",
    "external magnetometers , on the other hand , do not measure the field in the volume of interest directly , but allow - if used in sufficient number - to access field distributions , thereby permitting the active control of specific multipole moments of the field .",
    "borisov et al .",
    "have proposed a large volume ( external ) magnetometer based on nuclear spin precession in @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "that device uses a double pulse ramsey resonance technique , which besides its lack of spatial resolution also suffers from a lack of temporal resolution .",
    "the pnpi experiment used two conventional state - of - the - art discharge lamp pumped self - oscillating cesium vapor magnetometers ( opm)@xcite . such types of magnetometers - developed since the 1950 s - have a shot - noise limited performance and large bandwidths .",
    "the high spatial and temporal resolution of optically pumped alkali magnetometers thus make such devices interesting alternatives for the continuous monitoring of fields , gradients , and fluctuations thereof .",
    "the use of alkali opms for the field control in larger volumes calls for a substantially larger number of sensor heads , which suffers from the fact that a single discharge lamp can only drive a limited number of sensors .",
    "the steady development in the past decades of narrow - band semiconductor diode lasers makes such light sources attractive alternatives to discharge lamps .",
    "owing to the high spectral density of its radiation a single diode laser of moderate power ( a few mw ) can be used to drive dozens of magnetometer heads .    having a multichannel external magnetometer approach for a planned neutron edm experiment in mind we have performed a comparative study of state - of - the - art discharge lamp pumped magnetometers ( lpopm ) and laser pumped magnetometers ( lsopm ) using similar room temperature sensor cells ( 7 cm and 6 cm diameter respectively ) and identical electronics .",
    "we discuss the principle of operation and details of their practical realization .",
    "the devices were operated in two distinct modes , viz . , the self - oscillating mode and the phase - stabilized mode .",
    "details of the development and performance of the lsopm have been published earlier @xcite .",
    "we have determined the intrinsic sensitivities of the magnetometers and present measurements of the fluctuations of a @xmath1 field recorded simultaneously by the lsopm and the lpopm in a multi - layer magnetic shield .",
    "the lpopm reached its ultimate shot - noise limited performance while the lsopm showed a superior intrinsic sensitivity , although its performance still lies 50% above its fundamental shot - noise limit .",
    "an opm measures the larmor precession frequency @xmath4 of a vapor sample of spin polarized atoms in an external magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "in small magnetic fields @xmath6 and the field measurement reduces to a frequency measurement . in eq .",
    "[ eq : larmorfrequency ] the subscript of @xmath7 refers to the total angular momentum of the precessing atomic state . although opms based on nuclear spin polarization were demonstrated in the past @xcite we restrict the present discussion to alkali vapors in which the precessing levels are one or both of the hyperfine ground states with total angular momentum @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the nuclear spin .",
    "magnetic resonance is used to measure the precession frequency by inducing resonant spin flips by a weak magnetic field @xmath10 oriented at right angles with respect to @xmath5 and oscillating at the frequency @xmath11 .",
    "although for the magnetometer discussed here @xmath11 lies in the audio range of frequencies the index `` rf '' ( radio - frequency ) is used to comply with common notation .    optical pumping with a resonant circularly",
    "polarized light beam creates spin polarization in the medium ( room temperature alkali atom vapor contained in a glass cell ) and hence an associated net bulk magnetization .",
    "it has been realized for many years that the pumping process is most efficient for @xmath12 resonance light driving the transition @xmath13 , although magnetometers can also be realized using @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) light . in general the optically pumped medium",
    "becomes transparent with respect to the pumping light , except for the spectrally resolved closed @xmath16 transition @xcite , in which case the absorption of the pumped medium increases .",
    "the fact that the optical properties of the medium depend on its spin polarization is used to detect the magnetic resonance transition by monitoring either the power or the polarization of the transmitted or scattered light beam .",
    "the technique is known as optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) .    in the present study",
    "we have used a particular realization of the odmr technique , the so - called @xmath17-method , in which @xmath5 is oriented at 45@xmath18 with respect to the direction of propagation ( @xmath19 ) of the circularly polarized light beam .",
    "the particular feature of that technique is that the transmitted light intensity is modulated at the frequency @xmath11 of the oscillating field , when @xmath11 is tuned close to @xmath4 .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation depends as @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "the amplitude and phase of the modulation depend on @xmath11 as a classical lorentz oscillator with a resonance frequency @xmath4 . on resonance",
    "the phase shift between the oscillating @xmath10-field and the transmitted light modulation is @xmath22 and for a small detuning @xmath23 the phase shift varies linearly with @xmath24 .",
    "the width of the resonance(s ) are determined by the transverse relaxation rate of the spin polarization , which is limited by several effects . in atom - atom collisions",
    "only the sum of the angular momenta of the collision partners is preserved but spin - exchange processes can change the individual polarizations . the rate of spin exchange depolarization is proportional to the collision rate , i.e. , to the vapor density , the spin - exchange cross - section , and the relative velocities of the collision partners .",
    "the dominant depolarization mechanism is due to collisions of the atoms with the cell walls and the depolarization rate depends on the adsorption time of the atoms on the walls and on the wall collision rate .",
    "this process can be suppressed by either preventing the atoms from reaching the walls through the addition of an inert buffer gas or by reducing the sticking time on the walls by a suitable coating of the wall surfaces by paraffin or silanes . however , these coatings may act as a sink for alkali atoms thereby significantly lower the atomic density @xcite . a stable vapor pressure is established by having the vapor in thermal equilibrium with a droplet of alkali metal contained in a sidearm . depolarizing collisions with the bulk metal",
    "are suppressed by connecting the cell proper to the sidearm via a small aperture .",
    "the intrinsic linewidth resulting from the combined action of the mentioned depolarization effects depends on temperature , quality of the wall coating and cell geometry .",
    "besides those intrinsic broadening mechanisms the interaction with the optical field and with the oscillating magnetic field further broaden the magnetic resonance line .",
    "these processes are known as optical and r.f .",
    "power broadening respectively .",
    "the ground state of alkali atoms with a nuclear spin @xmath9 splits into two hyperfine levels with total angular momenta @xmath25 with @xmath26 zeeman sublevels labeled by the magnetic quantum number @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the general evolution of the hyperfine levels in a magnetic field is described by the breit - rabi - formula @xcite . in low magnetic fields ( zeeman interaction @xmath28 hyperfine interaction )",
    "the energy of the state @xmath29 is shifted by @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 is the bohr magneton , and the g - factors @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electronic g - factor , defined via @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the nuclear g - factor , defined via @xmath37 .",
    "the magnetic resonance process consists in driving transitions between adjacent sublevels with a resonance frequency @xmath4 given by @xmath38 which is equivalent to eq .",
    "[ eq : larmorfrequency ] with @xmath39 for @xmath40cs",
    "one has @xmath41 in second order in the field @xmath5 the levels acquire an additional energy shift depending on @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( quadratic zeeman effect ) which shifts the @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ground state hyperfine splitting .",
    "the quadratic zeeman effect thus splits the magnetic resonance into a series of equidistant lines separated by @xmath46 for cesium ( @xmath47 ) , one has @xmath48    in the 2@xmath49 t field used here @xmath50hz , which is much smaller than the resonance linewidth . the low field approximation ( eq .",

    "both devices have a common basic design consisting of the light source , the sensor head , the detector and feedback electronics ( figs .",
    "[ fig : mag_genprinc ] , [ fig : ps_so_electronics ] ) .",
    "the sensor head contains the sensor proper , a spherical glass cell ( 60 mm diameter for the lpopm , produced in the group of one of the authors , a.s.p . , and 70 mm diameter for the lsopm , purchased from magtech ltd . , st .",
    "petersburg , russia ) coated with paraffin in which cesium vapor is in thermal equilibrium with a droplet of metallic cesium at room temperature .",
    "the cell is mounted in a ( 200 mm long , 110 mm diameter ) cylindrical housing .",
    "the pumping light is carried from the light source to the sensor cell by a multimode fiber ( 800@xmath53 diameter ) in the lsopm and by a fibre bundle ( 6 mm diameter ) in the lpopm .",
    "the light transmitted through the cell is carried back to a detector ( photodiode ) by an identical fiber in the lsopm and by an 8 mm diameter fiber bundle in the lpopm .",
    "the lengths of the fibers are 8 m and 5 m length respectively for the laser and the lamp pumped device .",
    "the sensor head contains also polarization optics ( linear polarizer and quarter - wave plate ) for making the light circularly polarized prior to entering the cell as well as lenses for collimating the incoming light and focussing the outgoing light into the return fiber ( bundle ) .",
    "particular care was taken to use only non - magnetic components in the sensor head .",

    "the magnetic field of 2@xmath49 t was produced by a 50 cm long , 15 cm diameter solenoid driven by an ultra - low noise current supply .",
    "for a direct comparison of the noise performance with an accuracy below 0.1pt the level of magnetic field fluctuations at the experimental site have to be kept below that level , a performance , which is hard to realize . magnetic field variations ( in a 1hz bandwidth ) in unshielded environments are of the order of several @xmath57 or more . a shielding factor exceeding 10000",
    "is thus needed to suppress fluctuations at that level .      in both types of magnetometers",
    "the d@xmath51 transition @xmath58 of cs at a wavelength of 894 nm is used for optical pumping .",
    "the lpopm is driven by an electrodeless discharge lamp , in which a power stabilized high frequency generator ( @xmath59 100mhz ) produces a discharge in a 12 mm diameter glass bulb containing cesium vapor and xenon as buffer gas .",
    "the pumping light is collimated and filtered by a d@xmath51 interference filter centered at 894.5 nm with a fwhm=11.5 nm .",
    "because of the high temperature of the discharge plasma the spectrum of the emitted d@xmath51 radiation is considerably broader than the doppler width of the room temperature absorption line in the sensor cell .",

    "[ fig : csd1](a ) . as the same light is used for detecting the ground state spin precession the lpopm detects magnetic resonance in both the f=4 and the f=3 hyperfine ground states . because of the differing g - factors of the two states ( eq .

    "therefore a single laser can be used to drive dozens of magnetometers in experiments calling for the simultaneous monitoring of the magnetic field in different locations .",
    "the laser frequency is actively stabilized to the doppler broadened @xmath61 hyperfine transition using a dichroic atomic vapor laser lock ( davll ) @xcite in an auxiliary ( vacuum ) cesium cell .",
    "this lock is very stable and allows a reliable operation of the magnetometer over measurement periods of several weeks .    in both magnetometers the states @xmath62 are dark states and @xmath63 are also dark states . ] which can not absorb circularly polarized light . at the same time the repopulation of absorbing ( bright ) states by the magnetic resonance r.f .",
    "transitions from these levels is used for the optical detection of the magnetic resonance .",
    "the lsopm drives the @xmath64 hyperfine state , which do not interact with the narrow band light .",
    "this process , called hyperfine pumping , degrades the efficiency of the optical pumping process and reduces the overall spin polarization which can be achieved with laser radiation . a straightforward way to reduce that loss",
    "is to empty the @xmath65 sublevels using a repumping laser tuned to a transition emanating from the f=3 hyperfine ground state .",
    "an experimental study of that process is underway .",
    "in the lpopm all four hyperfine components are pumped simultaneously . as a result the loss due to hyperfine pumping",
    "is excluded and a larger spin polarization is obtained in the f=4 state .",
    "the drawback of the large spectral width of the beam from the lamp is that an appreciable part of its spectrum lies outside of the room temperature absorption spectrum of the sensor cell .",
    "the corresponding photons carry no spectroscopic information , but produce excess shot noise in the detected photocurrent . in that respect narrow - band laser light",
    "leads to a better detection efficiency in the lsopm .",
    "both types of magnetometers were operated in two different modes . the self - oscillating mode ( som ) ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ps_so_electronics ] a ) uses the fact that at resonance the driving r.f . field and the modulated photocurrent are dephased by 90@xmath18 . for that reason",
    "the sinusoidal part of the photocurrent can be used , with an appropriate amplification and phase shift to drive the r.f .",
    "coils in a feedback loop .",
    "in such a configuration the system will auto - oscillate at the larmor frequency .",
    "an amplitude gain control ensures that the amplitude of the coil current is kept constant independently of phase and frequency , so that any r.f .",
    "power dependent systematic effects are suppressed .    the phase - stabilized mode ( psm ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_so_electronics ] b ) also uses the characteristic phase dependence between the applied oscillating field and the modulation of the detected photocurrent for locking the frequency of an external oscillator to the larmor frequency .",
    "the phase , the in - phase component , and the quadrature component are detected simultaneously by a lock - in amplifier ( stanford research systems sr830 ) .",
    "both the in - phase signal ( dispersive lorentzian ) and the 90@xmath18 phase shifted phase signal ( arctan - dependence ) show a linear zero - crossing near zero detuning ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "either of the two signals can thus be used as discriminant in a feedback loop , which stabilizes the phase to 90@xmath18 .",
    "it can be shown that from a statistical point of view both signals yield an equivalent magnetic field sensitivity .",
    "the phase signal is less sensitive to light power fluctuations , which may be advantageous to suppress systematic effects related to power fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , the used commercial digital lock - in amplifier had only a moderate update rate of 400hz of its phase output , so that the much faster in - phase signal was used in the feedback loop .    in principle",
    "the psm can be understood as a variant of the som , in which the phase - detector , the vco , and the feedback controller form a tracking filter . in both modes of operation changes of the magnetic field lead to instantaneous changes of the larmor frequency and thus to instantaneous changes of the transmitted modulation frequency .",
    "the time needed for the radio - frequency to adjust to a new value after a sudden field change depends on the filters and other delays in the feedback loop .",
    "if a very fast response is not required , as in our applications , the bandwidth can be decreased by appropriate filters . in the som",
    "it is the preamplifier of the photodetector which limits the bandwidth to 10khz , whereas in the psm the feedback loop filters provide a bandwidth up to 1khz @xcite . from a practical point of view",
    "the registered bandwidth is limited by the data acquisition system . because of the frequency dependence of the phase - shifter the som is , in general , optimized only for a given larmor frequency , which reduces the dynamic range of the som device .",
    "the phase - stabilized magnetometer keeps the phase - shift at @xmath22 independently of the larmor frequency . in practice",
    "the dynamic range is limited by the frequency range of the voltage - controlled oscillator ( vco ) used to generate the oscillating field .",
    "the long - term stability of both feedback schemes is limited by temperature dependent phase drifts .",
    "the al shield slipped over each magnetometer for avoiding cross - talk effectively acts as a low - pass filter for external magnetic field fluctuations ( skin effect ) which reduces the response bandwidth of all devices to about 250hz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bwdeponalshield ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the magnetometer is defined as the noise equivalent magnetic flux density ( nem ) , which is the flux density change @xmath67 equivalent to the total noise of the detector signal . in a perfectly stable external magnetic field",
    "the smallest detectable field changes are limited by the intrinsic magnetometer noise @xmath68 . for a measurement bandwidth @xmath69 the intrinsic resolution @xmath68 depends on the magnetic resonance linewidth @xmath70 ( hwhm ) and on the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath71 of the magnetometer signal according to @xmath72 for a feedback operated magnetometer using an optically thin medium ( @xmath73 ) the light power ( expressed in terms of photocurrent ) detected after the sensor cell is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the incident power , @xmath76 the resonant optical absorption coefficient and @xmath77 the sample length .",
    "the absorption coefficient can be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mean absorption coefficient and @xmath80 is the modulation depth which depends - among others - on the degree of spin polarization and the amplitude of the oscillating field .",
    "we can then write eq .",
    "[ eq : transmittedcurrent ] as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the contrast @xmath84 is the ratio of the modulation amplitude and the average photocurrent in the approximation @xmath85 .",
    "the signal @xmath86 is given by the rms value of the oscillating part of the magnetometer signal @xmath87 the fundamental limit of the magnetometric sensitivity is obtained for a shot - noise limited signal , with a noise level @xmath88 of @xmath89 .",
    "the shot - noise limited sensitivity then reads @xmath90 the magnetometer signal of interest is contained in the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal modulation of the light power after the sensor cell .",
    "the power spectrum of the spectral power density of an ideal magnetometer in a perfectly stable magnetic field thus consists of a delta function centered at the larmor frequency , superposed on a flat background of shot - noise fluctuations . in practice",
    "the peak is broadened by the resolution ( 1hz ) of the fft analyzer ( stanford research systems , model sr760 ) used for its recording .",
    "the relevant noise contributions which define the s / n ratio are fluctuations of the photocurrent at the larmor frequency , i.e. , the value of the background below the larmor peak . in practice that ideal spectrum is modified by various imperfections which degrade the magnetometer performance . in the following we address contributions from light power fluctuations and magnetic field fluctuations .",

    "[ fig : lasernoise ] . the noise can be written as @xmath118 where @xmath115 is the shot - noise of the photocurrent , @xmath119 the intrinsic detector ( photodiode and amplifier ) noise , and @xmath120 technical noise of the light source , which is proportional to the photocurrent @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath119 was measured with the light beams blocked for all ( discrete ) amplification stages of the transimpedance amplifier . with the highest amplification ( @xmath121a / v ) used for @xmath122 we measured @xmath123 .",
    "this corresponds to the shot noise of a current @xmath91 of 7na , so that above 7na the intrinsic detector noise can be neglected .",
    "this dark current is responsible for the deviation of the measured noise from the ( dotted ) shot - noise line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lasernoise ] ) at low currents .    for larger photocurrents technical noise @xmath120 , which is proportional to the light power , dominates over the shot noise .",
    "we found @xmath124 , with @xmath125 and @xmath126 for the laser and the lamp source respectively . with the laser source",
    "the shot noise @xmath115 becomes equal to the technical noise @xmath120 for a photocurrent @xmath91 of @xmath127 , which thus yields a noise level @xmath128 at that photocurrent .",
    "the laser power for optimized magnetometer parameters corresponds to @xmath129 , thereby explaining the excess noise of the lsopm in figs .",
    "[ fig : fftlamplaserpsm ] and [ fig : fftlamplasersom ] . in the case of lamp",
    "pumping the technical noise becomes important for @xmath130 , so that the magnetometer is shot - noise limited for the ( optimized ) photocurrent of 4.3@xmath49a .",
    "if one succeeds in eliminating the excess noise of the laser power , e.g. , by an active power stabilization of the lsopm one can achieve an intrinsic shot - noise limited sensitivity of @xmath131 , thereby outperforming the lpopm by a factor of @xmath132 .",
    "this is compatible with earlier results @xcite obtained from a comparative study of lamp and laser pumped magnetometers using @xmath133k , in which the sensitivity of the lsopm version was found to be 2.3 times higher than of the corresponding lpopm device .",
    "it is also interesting to compare those results with the present results on an absolute scale .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath133k - lsopm was found to be 1.8ft/@xmath134 .",
    "this superior performance compared to the @xmath40cs magnetometer discussed here is mainly due to the two times larger diameter of the potassium sensor cell , which , combined with the appreciably smaller spin exchange cross section of potassium , led to an operating linewidth of 1hz compared to 5hz with the present cs - lsopm",
    ". furthermore the g - factor of @xmath133k is twice as large than that of @xmath40cs .",
    "these two factors explain the superior performance of the k - magnetometer ( @xmath135 ) compared to the cs magnetometer ( @xmath111 ) .",

    "the lines are drawn to guide the eye .",
    "in the two lower graphs the single points at @xmath1360.5s indicate the nem of the lpopm ( open circle ) and of the lsopm ( black dot ) , and their extrapolation to other integration times assuming white noise.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we performed a direct comparison of the performance of the lpopm and the lsopm in simultaneous measurements of magnetic field fluctuations inside the multilayer shield described above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fribourgshield ] ) .",
    "both devices were mounted coaxially in the shield and the centers of their sensor cells were separated by 21 cm .",
    "the oscillatory signal of each magnetometer was filtered by a resonance amplifier , centered near 7khz with a fwhm of 500hz , and analyzed by a frequency counter ( stanford research systems , model sr620 ) with a gate time of 0.1s .",
    "an example of such a recording over a continuous interval of 6 hours with the lpopm operated in psm and the lsopm operated in the som is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsls2lp4_6h ] .",
    "one sees that both devices oscillate a different average frequencies , which can be explained by the presence of a magnetic field gradient of 66pt / cm which drifts by 0.4% over the 6 hour interval .",
    "the drift is probably due to a thermal drift of the shield s magnetization .",
    "similar gradients were measured after interchanging the positions of the two opms .",
    "figure  [ fig : tsls2lp4_5min ] shows a 5 minutes time slice of the data in fig .  [ fig : tsls2lp4_6h ] .",
    "there are highly correlated irregular field jumps of approximately 3.6pt in both traces .",
    "these fluctuations correspond to relative fluctuations of the solenoid current at a level of 10@xmath137 and are suspected to be caused by the current source .",
    "the allan standard deviation @xcite of the data is a convenient way for characterizing the field drifts on various time scales .",
    "[ fig : asdls2lp4 ] shows the allan plot of the data from fig .",
    "[ fig : tsls2lp4_6h ] as a function of integration time both in absolute and in relative units .",
    "both magnetometers show the same field stability and the data points are indistinguishable for small integration times .",
    "while the short term stability is governed by white noise , the bump between 1 and 200s is due to the irregular field jumps .",
    "the long term stability is determined by long term field drifts of the imperfectly shielded external field and thermal drifts of the solenoid support structure . at the encountered level of field fluctuations",
    "possible false effects due to the light shift are negligible @xcite .",
    "+    we have further investigated the performance of the magnetometers in an active magnetic field stabilization system using a phase - locked loop . for that purpose the phase of the lpopm oscillation ( psm ) relative to the phase of a reference oscillator was measured by a lock - in amplifier and used as error signal driving a correction coil . while field fluctuations common to both sensors are strongly suppressed by this method , gradient drifts and fluctuations are not compensated and thus detected by the free - running magnetometer .",
    "the performance of the stabilization scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsasdlp4stab ] , where the top traces represent time series of the field readings ( 1s gate time of the frequency counter ) of the free - running lsopm and the lpopm used for the feedback . the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : tsasdlp4stab ] shows the allan standard deviation of those data .",
    "the jumps in the magnetic field measured by the lsopm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tsls2lp4_5min ] ) are completely suppressed by the feedback loop and only white noise in the short term stability and contributions from gradient drifts in the long term stability remain .",
    "the field fluctuations reach a minimum of 25 ft for @xmath136100s , which corresponds to a relative field stability of 1.3@xmath138 . due to the fact that the field is stabilized to the lpopm",
    "one would expect a significant lowering of the lpopm s allan standard deviation for short integration times .",
    "the white noise behavior ( slope @xmath139 in the allan plot ) of the lpopm trace is entirely due to the resolution of the frequency counter , which is limited by trigger time jitter due to amplitude noise of the measured sine wave .",
    "we also realized a setup , in which the roles of the lsopm and the lpopm were reversed . the observed performance was identical with the one described .",
    "opms based on cs vapor are well suited for operation in magnetic fields smaller than @xmath140 t ( such as typical fields used in neutron edm experiments ) . in such fields asymmetries of the magnetic resonance line due to the quadratic zeeman effect will not affect their long - term stability ( accuracy ) . in fields between 10@xmath49 t and 200@xmath49 t the line asymmetry due to the quadratic zeeman effect depends on the light power and",
    "power fluctuations induce fluctuations of that asymmetry and thus of the resonance frequency . in magnetic fields above 300@xmath49 t",
    "the quadratic zeeman shift exceeds the linewidth and the magnetic resonance spectrum consists of 8 resolved lines @xcite .",
    "this offers a further possibility for the use of cesium magnetometers .",
    "the performance of the lsopm in that field range is expected not to be worse than the one measured in a 2@xmath49 t field .",
    "this expectation is based on the fact that the ( performance determining ) laser power noise does not increase with frequency , so that a shot - noise limited sensitivity can be reached .",
    "a magnetometer based on the quadratic zeeman effect in potassium has been demonstrated earlier @xcite .",
    "in contrast to buffer gas cells , which require the whole cell volume to be illuminated in order to achieve a maximum sensitivity , paraffin - coated cells can be pumped with a laser beam of much smaller diameter .",
    "this allows one to adapt the spatial dimensions of the paraffin - coated sensors to specific experimental requirements .",
    "one can think , e.g. , of using very large cells of several liters for measuring volume averaged fields . compared to other",
    "proposed large cell schemes@xcite , the use of a cs - opm offers the further advantage of a high temporal resolution .",
    "recently , a novel type of optically pumped magnetometer with a sub - ft ( gradiometric ) sensitivity was demonstrated @xcite . besides its use of very high buffer gas pressures and its operation at a temperature of 190@xmath18c , specific features of that magnetometer are its limited operation range near zero field and its reduced bandwidth of 20hz .",
