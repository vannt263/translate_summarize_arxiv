    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies is a fundamental statistical tool to study the populations of galaxies .",
    "its dependence on morphological type , on wavelength and on look - back time provides constraints on the evolution of the properties of the whole population of galaxies , of the populations of various morphological types and on their contribution to the luminosity density at different wavelength .",
    "the parameters derived by the best - fitting of the lf , the characteristic luminosity m@xmath13 , the slope @xmath9 and the normalization @xmath14 , provide strong constraints to the models of galaxy formation .",

    "it is now well established that the lf depends on morphological type , that the faint - end is increasingly dominated by galaxies with late - type morphology and spectra and that their number density increases going to lower luminosities . on the contrary ,",
    "the bright - end is dominated by early - type galaxies whose fraction increases with luminosities ( e.g. marzke et al .",

    "they used the observed i - band photometry to derive the rest - frame b - band luminosities .",
    "subsequent studies confirmed the different behaviors followed by the lf of the different populations of galaxies at various redshifts ( e.g. lin et al .",
    "1997 ; liu et al . 1998 ) and the differential evolution they underwent ( e.g. bell et al . 2004 ; wolf et al .",

    "the studies of the lf in the optical rest - frame confirm the presence of the bi - modality and provide evidences of luminosity and of density evolution down to @xmath22 ( e.g. poli et al .",

    "contrary to the light at uv and at optical wavelengths , the near - ir light is less affected by dust extinction and by ongoing star formation e.g. rix & riecke 1993 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) . moreover , since the near - ir light of a galaxy is dominated by the evolved population of stars , the near - ir light is weakly dependent on galaxy type and it is more related to the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the lf of galaxies in the near - ir rest - frame can provide important clues on the history of the stellar mass assembly in the universe rather than on the evolution of the star formation .",
    "the studies of the k - band luminosity function conducted so far have shown no or little evolution of the population of galaxies at @xmath23 ( e.g. glazebrook et al .",

    "the rest - frame k - band would be required .",

    "another reason could be that deep k - band observations allowing a good sampling of the lf at magnitudes fainter than m@xmath13 over a wide redshift range are not so common .",

    "the near - ir data reduction , the detection and the magnitude estimate are described in detail in saracco et al .",
    "( 2001 ; 2004 ) . to construct our catalog , we considered the area of the hdf - s fully covered by all the images in the various bands resulting in an area of @xmath41 arcmin@xmath40 . on this area",
    "we detected 610 sources at ks@xmath42 . in fig .",

    "this is consistent with the number counts shown in fig . 1 which raise till ks@xmath43 .",
    "down to ks@xmath33 the near - ir photometric errors are lower than 0.2 magnitudes while they rapidly increase at fainter magnitudes as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 making very uncertain the photometric redshift estimate .",
    "thus , according to these considerations , we constructed the sample by selecting all the sources ( 332 ) brighter than ks=23 ( k23 sample hereafter ) .",
    "we then identified and removed the stars from the k23 sample relying both on the sextractor star / galaxy classifier and on the colors of the sources . in fig .",
    "2 the stellar index ( class_star ) computed by sextractor for the 332 sources of the k23 sample is shown as a function of the ks - band apparent magnitude . for magnitudes brighter than ks@xmath44 point like sources ( class_star@xmath45 ) and",
    "extended sources ( class_star@xmath46 ) are well segregated while they tend to mix at fainter magnitudes .",
    "we defined stellar candidates those sources with magnitudes ks@xmath47 having a class_star@xmath48 both in the ks - band image and in the i@xmath37-band image .",
    "we obtained a sample of 23 stellar candidates . among them , 7 bright ( ks@xmath49 ) sources display spikes in the hst - wfpc images implying that they are most likely stars . for the remaining 16 candidates we verified that their optical and near - ir colors were compatible with those of stars",
    "3 the colors js - ks and v@xmath36-i@xmath37 of the k23 sample are plotted as a function of the ks magnitude and of the js - ks color respectively .",
    "the 16 star candidates and the 7 bright stars are marked by filled points and starred symbols respectively .",
    "as can be seen , all but 2 of the candidates occupy the stellar locus at j - k@xmath50 and are well segregated both in the color - magnitude and in the color - color plane . on the contrary , the two candidates lying far from the stellar locus of fig . 3 display colors not compatible with those of stars . in particular ,",
    "while their j - k color ( j - k@xmath51 ) could be consistent with the near - ir color of an m6-m8 spectral type , the other optical colors differ even more than 2 magnitudes from those characterizing these stars .",
    "thus , these two sources are most probably misclassified compact galaxies .",
    "this has made us to classify 21 stars out of the 23 candidates originally selected on the basis of the sextractor stellar index at ks@xmath47 .    at magnitudes fainter than ks=21",
    "other sources ( 18 ) lie in the locus occupied by stars defined by a color j - k@xmath50 . by a visual inspection of the 18 sources on the hst images we clearly identified the extended profile for 7 of them . on the contrary ,",
    "the remaining 11 sources have fwhm and surface brightness profile consistent with a point - like source .",
    "we probed the stellar nature of these 11 star candidates by comparing their observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) defined by broad - band photometry with a set of spectral templates of stellar atmospheres from the kurucz s atlas ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "the observed seds of all the 11 star candidates are very well fitted by those of m and k stars .",
    "all but one are not targets of spectroscopic observations , as we verified through the eso archive data available .",

    "it is interesting to note the effectiveness of this method in identifying stars and galaxies among faint k - selected objects . in the right panel of fig .",
    "4 we show , as example , the seds of 5 out of the 11 stars together with the relevant best - fitting kurucz s templates . therefore , we classified stars also these 11 sources and we removed a total of 32 stars from the k23 sample which results in 300 galaxies .",

    "we find hints of a raise of the faint end ( m@xmath6 and m@xmath7 ) of the near - ir lf at @xmath8 .",

    "they account for a comoving number density @xmath63 mpc@xmath64 at @xmath65 , almost one order of magnitude higher than that of brighter galaxies .",

    "we find no evidence of a steepening with redshift of the near - ir lfs of galaxies in the hdf - s .",
    "the value of @xmath9 we find is consistent with the local value . given the size of our sample , we estimate that if @xmath9 changes with redshift its evolution is constrained within @xmath66 from @xmath67 to @xmath27 .",
    "we do not find evidence of strong evolution of the lf up to @xmath3 , where 50% of our galaxies has spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the comparison with the local estimates of the near - ir lf ( cole et al .",
    "2001 ; kochanek et al .",
    "2001 ) shows that m@xmath13 has evolved not more than 0.2 - 0.3 magnitude in this redshift range , while the number density of galaxies ( @xmath14 ) has not evolved significantly in this redshift range , in agreement with the previous studies ( e.g. drory et al .",

    "this evolution is characterized by @xmath70 ( at 1@xmath39 ) coupled with @xmath71 ( at @xmath72 ) . the brightening persists",
    "( at 1@xmath39 ) up to @xmath15 together with the decline of @xmath14 ( at @xmath73 ) even if at a lower extent .",
    "our results agrees , at least qualitatively , with most of the analysis previously done ( drory et al .",
    "2003 ; pozzetti et al . 2003 ; feulner et al . 2003 ; caputi et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) while deviates from the recent estimate of dahlen et al .",
    "taking into account that the near - ir light is rather tightly connected to the stellar mass , our results can give insights on the evolution of the stellar mass of the galaxies besides their luminosity .",
    "up to @xmath74 , clearly little luminosity evolution and no density evolution is observed .",
    "this suggests that the population of local bright galaxies was already formed at @xmath75 and that their stellar mass growth was already completed at this redshift .",
    "this agrees with the results on the evolution of the stellar mass density obtained by many authors : fontana et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and rudnick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in the hdf - s , fontana et al .",

    "( 2005 ) in the goods and fdf fields and feulner et al .",
    "( 2005a ) in the munics fields .",
    "indeed , all of them find very little or even no evolution in the stellar mass function of galaxies and in the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) at @xmath19 for high - mass galaxies . at @xmath16",
    "the evolution is stronger and the larger brightening observed is accompanied by a decrease of the number density of bright / massive galaxies . in the redshift bin [ 0.8,1.9 ) the number density of bright galaxies is @xmath76% of the local value and reaches @xmath77% at @xmath78 .",
    "this decline in the number density suggests that up to @xmath79% of the local massive / bright galaxies has grown at @xmath17 through star formation , merging or both .",
    "thus , we should expect to observe massive star - forming galaxies with disturbed / irregular morphology and merging systems in this high redshift range , as indeed found in same cases ( e.g. daddi et al . 2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed evolution implies also that at least 30% of the local bright / massive galaxies was already in place at @xmath80 as indeed found by some authors ( fontana et al .",

    "( 2005a ) show that the bright end of the lf is dominated by early - type galaxies and that their contribution to the bright end does not decline with redshift .",
    "thus , that 30% should be dominated by early - types implying that we should observe massive evolved galaxies fully assembled at @xmath80 and even at @xmath82 .",
    "this is indeed observed by many authors ( cimatti et al .",

    "it is worth noting that this picture could be accounted for , at least qualitatively , in the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation as suggested by the recent results obtained by nagamine et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    from these considerations",
    "we can gather that the growth of massive galaxies does not follow a unique way but displays different behaviours .",
    "a significant fraction ( 50 - 70% ) of the brighetst / most massive galaxies increases their stellar mass over a large redshift range at @xmath21 .",
    "the remaining fraction reaches their final mass in a narrower redshift range at @xmath18 since it is already in place by this redshift .",
    "this suggests that , for the former , the stellar mass growth has been less efficient and has proceeded more slowly than for the latter . on the contrary , in the latter",
    ", the stellar mass has to be grown rapidly in a short interval , surely much shorter than 1 gyr given their redshift .",
    "this is supported by the recent results derived by mid - ir massive galaxies observed at high - z ( e.g. caputi et al .",
    "2005b ) and suggests a high efficiency in the accretion of the stellar mass in massive haloes in the early universe , possibly through a very efficient star formation .",
    "the recent results obtained on the evolution of the ssfr of galaxies seems to point toward this direction .",
    "the strong increase in the ssfr of the most massive galaxies with redshift ( feulner et al .",
    "2005b ) favors indeed an efficient sfr in the brightest galaxies at @xmath83 constraining their growth in a very short interval .",

    "<S> we present the rest - frame js - band and ks - band luminosity function ( lf ) of a sample of about 300 galaxies selected in the hdf - s at ks@xmath0 ( vega ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use calibrated photometric redshift together with spectroscopic redshift for 25% of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy reached in the photometric redshift estimate is 0.06 ( rms ) and the fraction of outliers is 1% . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rest - frame js - band luminosities obtained by extrapolating the observed js - band photometry are consistent with those obtained by extrapolating the photometry in the redder h and ks bands closer to the rest - frame js , at least up to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find no significant differences among the luminosities obtained with different spectral libraries . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our lf estimate is not dependent either on the extrapolation made on the best - fitting template or on the library of models used to fit the photometry . </S>",
    "<S> the selected sample has allowed to probe the evolution of the lf in the three redshift bins [ 0;0.8 ) , [ 0.8;1.9 ) and [ 1.9;4 ) centered at the median redshift @xmath2 $ ] and to probe the lf at @xmath3 down to the unprecedented faint luminosities m@xmath4 and m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find hints of a raise of the faint end ( m@xmath6 and m@xmath7 ) near - ir lf at @xmath8 , raise which can not be probed at higher redshift with our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath9 we estimate are consistent with the local value and do not show any trend with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we do not see evidence of evolution from @xmath10 to @xmath8 suggesting that the population of local bright galaxies was already formed at @xmath11 . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , we clearly detect an evolution of the lf to @xmath12 characterized by a brightening of m@xmath13 and by a decline of @xmath14 . to </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 m@xmath13 brightens by about 0.4 - 0.6 mag and @xmath14 decreases by a factor 2 - 3 . </S>",
    "<S> this trend persists , even if at a less extent , down to @xmath15 both in the js - band and in the ks - band lf . </S>",
    "<S> the decline of the number density of bright galaxies seen at @xmath16 suggests that a significant fraction of them increases their stellar mass at @xmath17 and that they underwent a strong evolution in this redshift range . on the other hand , this implies also that a significant fraction of local bright / massive galaxies was already in place at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our results suggest that the assembly of massive galaxies is spread over a large redshift range and that the increase of their stellar mass has been very efficient also at very high redshift at least for a fraction of them .    </S>",
