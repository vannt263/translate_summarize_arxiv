    "the recent indirect detections of extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) by doppler spectroscopy have taught us that such planetary systems can be very much unlike our own .",
    "to date , nearly @xmath430 egps have been discovered around stars with spectral types from m4 to f7 ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the planets themselves have minimum masses ( @xmath5 ) between @xmath40.42 and @xmath410 , orbital semi - major axes from @xmath40.042 a.u .",
    "to @xmath43.8 a.u . , and eccentricities as high as @xmath40.71 .",
    "such variety vastly expands the parameter space within which both theorists and observers must operate in defining the physical character of extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "the most interesting , unexpected , and problematic subclass of egps are those found within @xmath40.1 a.u . of their primaries , 50100 times closer than jupiter is to our sun . at such orbital distances , due to prodigious stellar irradiation alone",
    ", an egp can have an effective temperature ( ) greater than 600 k. indeed , the egps hd187123b , hd209458b , @xmath0 boo b , hd75289b , 51 peg b , @xmath6 and b , and hd217107b likely all have above 1000 k. this is to be compared with for jupiter and saturn of 125 k and 95 k , respectively .",
    "the minimum masses of these close - in egps imply that they occupy the high-/low - gravity corner of parameter space for which the compositions and composition profiles may be unique ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , high stellar fluxes on a close - in egp can have profound structural consequences for the planet .",
    "in particular , stellar insolation can be responsible for maintaining the planet s radius at a value 20% to 80% larger than that of jupiter itself ( @xcite ) .",
    "this prediction has recently been verified by the observation of the transit by hd209458b of its primary .",
    "the depth of the transit yields values for its radius that range from @xmath41.27 ( @xcite ) to @xmath41.7 ( @xcite ) , with a best value near @xmath41.4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , since hd209458b transits its primary , astronomers can derive @xmath5 , from which the planet s mass can be directly determined .",
    "this is a major advance in the emerging study of extrasolar planets . in this paper , we focus on the hd209458 system and what broadly can be concluded theoretically from these new transit data .",
    "we do not provide detailed models from which one can extract bulk or atmospheric composition .",
    "rather , we show that the large radius of hd209458b is a consequence of the retardation by stellar irradiation of the otherwise natural cooling of the convective core of the planet and that such a radius requires that the planet did not dwell for long , if at all , at large orbital distances after its formation . hence , the large radius of a close - in egp is not due to the thermal expansion of its atmosphere , but to the high residual entropy that remains throughout its bulk as a consequence of its early proximity to a luminous primary .    recently , cameron ( 1999 ) , using spectral deconvolution , claim to have seen @xmath0 boo b in reflection . to investigate this exciting possibility",
    ", we calculate a range of theoretical radii for the @xmath0 botis planet .",
    "as we show , the cameron value of 1.61.8 for @xmath0 boo b s radius , if verified , is a challenge to the still embryonic theory of massive , close - in egps .",
    "nevertheless , with the discovery of a transiting planet , hd209458b , with the maturation of the technique of spectral deconvolution , and with the anticipated development of adaptive optics and interferometry for the direct study of extrasolar planets ( @xcite ) , we are clearly entering a new phase in extrasolar planetary research .",
    "the transit of the f8v / g0v star hd209458 ( at a distance of 47 parsecs ) by hd209458b lasts @xmath43 hours ( out of a total period of 3.524 days ) and has a depth of @xmath41.5 - 2.0% .",
    "its ingress and egress phases each last @xmath425 minutes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the properties of the planet , in particular its orbital distance and its radius , scale with the properties of the star and the most recent study of hd209458 was conducted in the context of these transits by mazeh ( 2000 ) .",
    "they conclude from @xmath7/spectral - line fits and @xmath8/@xmath9 photometric fits that = @xmath10 , r@xmath11 = @xmath12 , @xmath46000 k , [ fe / h]@xmath40.0 , @xmath13 gyr , and l@xmath14 .",
    "mazeh then derive for the planet : = 1.40@xmath15 , = @xmath16 ( @xmath17m@xmath18 ) , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 a.u .",
    "( @xmath17m@xmath21 ) .",
    "( all symbols have their standard meanings . )    fuhrmann ( 1998 ) provide parameters for the f7v star @xmath0 botis : = @xmath22 , r@xmath11 = @xmath23 , @xmath46360 k , [ fe / h]@xmath4 + 0.27@xmath240.08 , @xmath25 gyr , and l@xmath26 .",
    "its hipparcos distance is @xmath415.6 parsecs . with the fuhrmann mass for @xmath0 botis , butler ( 1997 )",
    "would have obtained for its close - in egp : @xmath5 = 4.33 , @xmath27 a.u . , and @xmath28 days .",
    "charbonneau ( 1999a ) quote an upper limit at @xmath44900  of @xmath29 to the fraction of the star s light reflected off the planet .",
    "cameron ( 1999 ) claim to have detected in the blue - green region of the spectrum a reflected fraction of @xmath30 . from the semi - amplitude ( @xmath474 km s@xmath31 ) of the doppler shift of this reflected fraction",
    ", they derive an orbital inclination ( @xmath32 ) of 29@xmath33 , which would yield a mass for @xmath0 boo b of @xmath49 . from their reflected fraction , an orbital planetary phase function , and a geometric albedo ( @xmath34 ) of 0.55 ( similar to that of jupiter",
    "in the visible ) , cameron obtain a radius for @xmath0 boo b of 1.61.8 .",
    "if @xmath34 were smaller , the inferred radius of the planet would be larger ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "by whatever processes giant planets are initially assembled , they must start out significantly larger than they end up . in isolation",
    ", they would cool inexorably due to radiation from their surfaces and shrink accordingly , just as does a protostar or a brown dwarf .",
    "early on , due to the negative effective specific heat of an object in hydrostatic equilibrium supported by ideal gas pressure , energy loss results in an increase in its central temperature . however , the density increases more quickly and , as a consequence , the specific entropy ( @xmath36 ) monotonically decreases",
    ". since egps are almost fully convective ( even if under significant stellar irradiation ; @xcite ) , they are isentropes .",
    "this is an essential point .",
    "given an eos and a planetary mass , an egp s core entropy determines its radius ( and its surface gravity ) .",
    "a large radius is a consequence of a large entropy .    as zapolsky and salpeter ( 1969 ) demonstrated for planets made of high-@xmath37 material , any planet with a cold radius larger than @xmath40.5 , must be made predominantly of hydrogen . using the aneos equation of state tables ( @xcite ) , we derive that an  olivine \" ( rock ) or h@xmath38o ( ice ) planet with a mass of 0.69 has a radius of 0.31 or 0.45 , respectively .",
    "importantly , these radii are 34 times smaller than observed for hd209458b and prove that hd209458b must be a hydrogen - rich gas giant ; it can not be a giant terrestrial planet or an ice giant such as neptune or uranus .",
    "the rate with which an egp shrinks is determined by the opacities in its outer radiative zone and the degree of stellar irradiation .",
    "if there were no radiative losses , the egp would not shrink . in isolation",
    ", the energy loss rate and are determined in the context of a self - consistent radiative / convective model and is a function of only @xmath36 and .",
    "( note that , for a given metallicity , the surface gravity of the egp is a function of @xmath36 and  alone . )",
    "the atmospheric flux in the outer skin determines the temperature profile at the boundary of the convective core and , hence , the rate of core entropy and radius decrease . according to theory ( @xcite ; burrows 1995,1997 ) , isolated egps shrink rapidly .",
    "a 1-egp in isolation contracts below 2.0 in less than @xmath39 years .",
    "the theory depends upon the atmospheric opacities and metallicity and can reproduce the current jupiter ( @xcite ) , but there still remain major uncertainties concerning grain and cloud formation ( @xcite ) , rainout ( @xcite ) , gas - phase opacities ( @xcite ) , and the depth of penetration of the stellar flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , while the basic theory of egp evolution is firm , the details are not and significant ambiguities in the variation of and with age persist .",
    "it is by altering the temperature / pressure profile of the atmosphere of an egp that stellar irradiation can retard the evolution of the egp s core entropy and , hence , .",
    "essentially , irradiation flattens the temperature profile at the top of the convective zone , while at the same time moving the radiative / convective boundary inward .",
    "the consequent growth of the radiative zone is a central feature of the large - radius phenomenon ( @xcite ) .",
    "since radiative fluxes are governed by the product of thermal diffusivities and temperature gradients and since the thermal diffusivity decreases with increasing pressure , the flux of energy out of the convective core and the rate of core entropy change are reduced . for close - in egps , stabilizes early at large values , while the  effective \" of the core , where most of the heat and mass resides , is drastically lowered .",
    "the upshot is a retardation of the contraction of the planet .",
    "large egp radii are a consequence of such retardation , and not of the expansion of the outer envelope by stellar heating .",
    "this is easy to demonstrate by noting that the scale height of hd209458b s atmosphere , under the assumption that is between 1200 k and 1700 k , is only @xmath41% of .",
    "though the mapping between @xmath36 and is unaltered by irradiation , the mapping between @xmath36 and age can change significantly .",
    "guillot ( 1996 ) predicted this behavior for 51 peg b , using a bond albedo ( @xmath40 ) of 0.35 , obtaining of 1.11.3 after 8 gyr .",
    "scaling the results of that paper using the stellar flux on hd209458b and a mass of 0.69 , we obtain between 1.4 and 1.6 for ages between 10 and 3 gyr , perfectly in line with the transit observations (  2 ) .",
    "figure 1 depicts two possible evolutionary trajectories for hd209458b , if born and fixed at 0.049 a.u .",
    "also included on figure 1 is a theoretical trajectory for a 0.69-egp in isolation .",
    "we have used for these calculations the formalisms of guillot ( 1995 , 1996 ) , guillot and morel ( 1995 ) , and burrows ( 1997 ) .",
    "tidal and roche effects have been ignored and are relevant only at very early ages ( @xmath41@xmath42 yrs ) .",
    "note , however , that despite its small orbital distance , hd209458b is beyond the roche limit by a factor of @xmath42.5 and is stable against loss both by thermal ( jeans ) escape and non - thermal processes involving absorption of stellar uv flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "a box of empirical ages and ( mazeh 2000 ) is superposed .    as can be seen in figure 1 , there is a great difference between the theoretical radius of an isolated and an irradiated egp .",
    "importantly , since the scale - height effect is miniscule , the trajectory of the isolated egp ( model i ) immediately suggests that if hd209458b were allowed to dwell at large orbital distances ( @xmath10.5 a.u . ) for more than a few @xmath43 years , its observed radius could not be reproduced . as figure 1 demonstrates , it is at such ages that the radius of an isolated 0.69-egp falls below hd209458b s observed radius . note that for @xmath10.5 a.u .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of our isolated hd209458b model at such an age exceeds the amount of stellar light that would have been intercepted .",
    "hence , stellar irradiation would have had little effect on this model .",
    "however , many orbital - distance / age histories can be contemplated and these will be the subject of a future work ( @xcite ) . to reiterate , hd209458b could not have cooled off and achieved a radius or an entropy like that of jupiter and then moved in . if it migrated , it had to have moved in early in its life .",
    "the radius of a close - in egp depends upon its history ( and the history of the star ) ; large radii require early proximity to a central star .",
    "this fact provides an upper limit to the timescale of planetary migration , if migration did indeed occur ( @xcite ) : conservatively , hd209458b dwelled less than a few@xmath43 years at more than 0.5 a.u .    the actual evolution of a close - in egp s radius depends upon its bond albedo ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the level of any clouds formed and their optical depths , the gas - phase abundances and opacities , the helium and metallicity fractions , the h - he eos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the depth of stellar flux penetration , and the primary star . in a later paper ( @xcite ) , we explore these effects and conduct a detailed parameter study .",
    "a range of trajectories similar to those depicted in figure 1 are still possible and when data on the hd209458b transit and primary star are further refined , theorists may well be able to sharply constrain the character of hd209458b s atmosphere and composition .",
    "we provide in figure 1 two representative theoretical trajectories for @xmath0 boo b , along with an error box constructed using cameron ( 1999 ) and fuhrmann ( 1998 ) . depending upon l@xmath11 and its bond albedo , which might vary from @xmath40.0 to perhaps 0.6 , @xmath0 boo",
    "b s is between 1350 k and 1750 k. these are higher than those corresponding to hd209458b and reflect @xmath0 botis higher l@xmath11 . due to uncertainties in the relative position of the silicate and iron cloud decks and the region of neutral alkali metals , there are still uncertainties in the atmospheric composition and albedos of such an egp ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". a high bond albedo might be a consequence of the presence at altitude of reflecting clouds . without these clouds , both the bond albedo and",
    "the geometric albedo in the blue - green region of the planetary spectrum would be low , perhaps below 0.1 .",
    "a low geometric albedo would put the measured radius of @xmath0 boo b even higher than the range quoted by cameron . as the evolutionary models on figure 1 suggest ,",
    "though a lower bond albedo results in a larger at a given age , the error box for @xmath0 boo b given in figure 1 still seems out of reach .",
    "note that a 9-@xmath0 boo b model in isolation achieves a radius of 1.6 within a scant 5 myr and that at 1 gyr such a model has a radius of 1.1 .",
    "the early radii of @xmath0 boo b shown on figure 1 are so much smaller than those of hd209458b because of the larger inferred mass of @xmath0 boo b and the particular choice of opacity data used for these exploratory models .",
    "other opacity databases would give quantitatively different radius - age trajectories early on , but would not alter the conclusion that the theoretical radius of a massive planet at late times ( @xmath44 few@xmath43 years ) is significantly below the @xmath0 boo b error box shown in figure 1 .",
    "furthermore , under the assumptions that the bond albedo is zero , that there is no outer radiative zone , and that the atmosphere and core of the planet have the same entropy , we can obtain a strong upper bound to the radius of a planet of a given age and mass ( guillot 1996 ) .",
    "for @xmath0 boo b , this radius is 1.58 for 7 and 1.48 for 10 , both below the quoted radius range .",
    "hence , we have difficulty fitting the cameron ( 1999 ) reflection data . in particular , despite significant irradiation , the large planetary mass measured by cameron ( 7 - 10 ) results in rapid early contraction .",
    "if the bond albedo is lower , the theoretical @xmath0 boo b radius for an age near 1 gyr would be larger , but the measured radius would also be larger .",
    "our cooling calculations use the hydrogen / helium eos of saumon , chabrier , and van horn ( 1995 , scvh ) .",
    "recent shock - compression experiments on deuterium ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) show that this eos underestimates the degree of molecular dissociation for pressures in the range @xmath45 mbar . however , by softening the repulsive part of the h@xmath38h and h ",
    "h potentials , the eos of scvh can be made to reproduce all experimental results ( @xcite ) .",
    "since adiabats of hot jupiters computed with the modified eos are systematically cooler and denser than those of scvh by up to 6% in @xmath46 and 10% in @xmath47 , such changes in the eos will reduce the theoretical radius of hd209458b by only a few percent , while modifying the corresponding quantity for @xmath0 boo b by a negligible amount .",
    "details of the transit lightcurve depend upon the distribution of slant optical depth , as determined by molecular opacity and cloud layers , and , to a lesser extent , on refractive redistribution of the stellar surface brightness by the planetary atmosphere .",
    "we use a theory to compute refractive effects that is essentially identical to that of the standard theory for occultations of stars by planetary atmospheres ( @xcite ) and have calculated the stellar brightness distribution for the transit of a planet with a radius equal to 1.4 r@xmath48 and a hot solar - composition atmosphere .",
    "the slant optical depth @xmath0 is computed for molecular opacity sources ( with and without clouds ) and at a variety of wavelengths .",
    "the effective radius of the planet , as determined by fitting the transit lightcurve , will depend upon the gas - phase opacity , the molecular composition , and the location of the optically - thick cloud layers ( @xcite ) .",
    "it will also be a diagnostic function of wavelength .",
    "our preliminary calculations for cloud - free models indicate that @xmath49 between 4500   and 6500   might be as much as 3% , smaller ( @xmath40.5% ) if the alkali metals are important . using a simple model for silicate cloud growth ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "we find a cloud base for hd209458b between @xmath50 and 0.4 bars and grain particle sizes between 1 and 100 microns .",
    "while for cloud models the wavelength dependence is muted , since the opacity varies strongly with particle size , there exists the possibility of remote sensing of cloud properties with high - precision measurements of upcoming transits ( @xcite ) .",
    "our theoretical calculations allow us to draw several specific conclusions :    1 .",
    "hd209458b is a real object , made predominantly of hydrogen .",
    "2 .   hd209458b",
    "s radius is a consequence of the retardation of contraction by stellar irradiation and is not due to atmospheric expansion by stellar heating .",
    "3 .   a large radius such as that of hd209458b requires early proximity to its central star .    curiously , given l@xmath11 , @xmath51 , and , hd209458b s total luminosity is @xmath52 , about twice that of a star with @xmath4100 times the mass at the very bottom of the stellar main sequence . given the large inferred mass of @xmath0 boo b , its large radius is less easy to explain theoretically .",
    "however , the inherent difficulties of close - in egp modeling may yet be responsible for theoretical surprises of a qualitative nature .",
