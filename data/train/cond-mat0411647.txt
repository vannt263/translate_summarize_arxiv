    "it is now well established that certain living tissues behave as viscoelastic fluids @xcite .",
    "classical experiments on the relaxation of embryonic aggregates subjected to mechanical deformations , either by centrifugation @xcite or by compression @xcite , demonstrated that tissues relax as elastic materials on short time scales and as viscous liquids on long time scales .",
    "the relaxation of compressed cellular aggregates was analyzed using a kelvin model of viscoelasticity @xcite . as stated by the authors",
    ", this model may represent a strong oversimplification of the tissue rheology but it gives an estimation of the tissue elastic and viscous parameters @xcite .",
    "the fusion or the rounding up of cell aggregates are similar to the coalescence or rounding up of liquid droplets .",
    "_ showed that these processes are driven by tissue surface tensions @xmath0 and opposed by tissue viscosity @xmath1 making a formal analogy with the rheology of viscous liquids .",
    "they obtained first estimates of the ratio @xmath2 for chicken embryonic cells @xcite .",
    "however , the authors gave only orders of magnitude of this ratio as they performed only preliminary experiments , presumably because it was difficult to obtain suspended three dimensional aggregates which were fixed over long times ( rotation or flattening on a surface are undesirable ) .",
    "later , the surface tensions of different chicken embryonic tissues have been measured using a parallel plate compression apparatus @xcite .",
    "in previous investigations one of us showed that a two dimensional ( 2d ) assembly of hydra cells behaves like a fluid : ( i ) cells exhibit collective @xcite or random @xcite motion , ( ii ) the hydrodynamical laws also apply for the rounding - up of initially elliptical aggregates @xcite .",
    "the shape relaxation was analyzed using the 2d hydrodynamical equations derived by mann _",
    "et al . _ for polymer monolayers in the case of dissipation dominated by surface viscosity @xcite .",
    "this method allowed an estimation @xmath3 min/@xmath4 m although @xmath0 was not measured independently .",
    "compared to the relaxation analysis of free 3d aggregates , 2d aggregates offer some advantages : they are not moving , nor rotating or flattening on a nearby surface .",
    "the 2d system also allows to track simultaneously cell motion and a direct comparison with 2d simulations .    in this paper , we summarize the main results obtained previously on 2d hydra aggregates @xcite",
    ". we also present current experiments on the rounding of 3d aggregates of chicken embryonic cells ( neural cells from the retina ) and simulations of rounding of 2d aggregates using the cellular potts model .",
    "because of its flexibility and simplicity of implementation , potts model has become a common technique for cell level simulation of biological tissues .",
    "it describes effectively the global features of tissue rearrangement experiments , including cell sorting @xcite and even the cell movements during the entire life cycle of the slime mould _ dictyostelium discoideum _ @xcite . in this study , we show that potts model effectively captures the exponential relaxation dynamics of aggregate rounding .",
    "however , both new experiments and simulations show a deviation from the hydrodynamics of viscous liquids .",
    "hydra aggregates were prepared according to previously reported methods @xcite with 25 @xmath5 spacers ( fig .",
    "a sequence of events in a pure endodermal aggregate initially elliptical is displayed in figs .",
    "1b - c . rounding up is completed after 6h .",
    "we studied also the rounding of mixed and pure ectodermal aggregates @xcite .",
    "images were digitized at intervals of @xmath6 min and analyzed on a computer using the software nih image @xcite .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath7 was used to describe the aggregate shape , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the major and minor axis of the fitted ellipse .",
    "@xmath10 is zero for a perfect circle and increases for elongated aggregates .",
    "1d shows a log - linear plot of the time dependence of the @xmath10 for the different 2d aggregates investigated .",
    "for each aggregate , @xmath10 decreases exponentially with time .",
    "such exponential behavior is expected theoretically in 2d from the hydrodynamics laws in case of viscosity dominated by the surface viscosity and rounding driven by line tension @xcite . in case of 2d aggregates confined between two glass slides ,",
    "if the cell / glass friction may be neglected compared to cell / cell friction , the relaxation time is given by relation : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius of the rounded aggregate ( final time ) , @xmath1 is a bulk surface viscosity , and @xmath0 the tissue / external medium surface tension @xcite .",
    "the typical time scale of rounding depends thus on the ratio between the surface tension and viscosity .",
    "the aggregates round to decrease superficial tension , while viscosity acts in the sense of delaying the rounding .",
    "1e shows that for each aggregate type , @xmath13 is increasing with @xmath12 as expected from the hydrodynamical law eq .",
    "[ tc ] . the ratio @xmath14 min/@xmath4 m which gives @xmath15 pa.s ( 1 pa.s = 10 poise ) using @xmath0=1 mn / m as a typical value of tissue surface tension @xcite .",
    "this is @xmath16 times higher than the water viscosity .",
    "we performed relaxation experiments on chicken embryonic tissues which have been already characterized by surface tensiometry @xcite .",
    "neural cell tissues were obtained from the retina of 9 day old chicken embryos .",
    "after dissection and trypsinization , cells were reaggregated by shaking them slowly in 12-well plates ( 200 r.p.m . ) containing culture medium ( bme culture medium with 10% fetal calf serum @xcite ) at 37@xmath17c during 16 hours .",
    "we could not obtain proper 2d chicken aggregates for relaxation experiments .",
    "we used instead non - compressed 3d aggregates , just floating near a bottom slide glass ( fig .",
    "these aggregates are sufficiently stable for shape analysis , they do not move or rotate significantly and do not spread on the bottom slide glass .",
    "figures 2b - c show the shape of a 9-day old 3d aggregate between initial and final time ( 24h ) .",
    "the time dependence of the deformation parameter of these aggregates is well exponential as expected from hydrodynamics with a relaxation time @xmath13 of about 1 day ( fig .",
    "in case of rounding of 3d ellipsoid droplets , @xmath13 is given by a slightly different relation than the 2d equation [ tc ] @xcite : @xmath18 where the constant @xmath19 in case of aggregate internal viscosity much larger than external medium viscosity @xcite , and @xmath12 is the radius of the rounded 3d aggregate .    at a first sight , @xmath13 seems to increase linearly with aggregate radius . the doted line in fig .",

    "the surface tension of neural aggregates dissected at 6 days and maintained in culture for various time periods was measured with the compression plate apparatus @xcite .",
    "the value increases with continued incubation for about a day ( between 6 and 7 days ) , then stabilizes for a time period of about 2 days at @xmath21 mn / m and increases again between 8 and 9 days to about @xmath22 mn / m . taking this latter value",
    ", we obtain the following neural tissue viscosity value at 9 days : @xmath23 pa.s .",
    "it is much higher than in hydra aggregates .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "first , because the kinetics of rounding is much slower in chicken embryonic neural aggregates .",
    "also because cell packing is much higher in these 3d aggregates ( fig .",
    "2b - c ) than in the 2d hydra aggregates ( fig .",
    "it is likely that tissue surface tension and tissue viscosity depend both on cell / cell adhesion @xcite and that adhesion is higher for 3d chicken embryonic aggregates than 2d hydra aggregate .",
    "however , @xmath13 is probably increasing faster than linearly , _",
    "i.e. _ , a power law @xmath24 fits better the data ( correlation coefficient , 0.939 ) .",
    "although there is large dispersion of the experimental points which is often inherent to such a biological system , the visual impression is also better than with linear fit ( fig .",
    "of course , these data should be confirmed but they seem to indicate that 3d chick embryonic cell aggregates do not behave as viscous liquids .",
    "the relaxation of initially elongated aggregates toward a circular shape is clearly exponential but relaxation time is not proportional to the aggregate size .",
    "the model is based on the cellular potts model @xcite and is defined as follows : at each site @xmath25 of a square lattice with dimensions @xmath26 we attribute a spin that may assume any integer value .",
    "the set of all sites with equal spin @xmath27 defines a cell , labeled by s.    adhesion between cells originates in the interaction between each spin and its 20 surrounding neighbors ( up to fourth neighbors to avoid pinning to the square lattice @xcite ) .",
    "the lowest interaction energy , here taken as zero , happens between equal spins , simulating the absence of surface tension between sites belonging to the same cell .",
    "energy between different cells is taken to be positive and when different types of cells are considered , the interaction energy may also be different , depending on the types involved in the interaction .",
    "the intensity of each possible interaction must be specified .",
    "hence , for example , for a system made of an aggregate of cells of two types only and medium we must define three parameters .",
    "the result is a proportional to the shared interface length , with a proportionality constant depending on the neighboring cell types to reflect differential adhesion strengths .",
    "cell resistance to compression is modeled by an energy term proportional to the square deviation of cell area from its target area @xmath28 .",
    "the proportionality parameter @xmath29 plays the role of a lagrange multiplier for this constraint and regulates cell compressibility .",

    "( [ hamil ] ) by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the adhesion energies per unit of interface between cells and medium and between cells , respectively .",
    "we implement the simulations as follows .",
    "we randomly choose a lattice site @xmath33 and one of its eight surrounding neighbors .",
    "we then propose that the site assumes the neighboring spin value @xmath42 and accept with probability @xmath43 :    @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the variation in energy produced by the change of spin values . a monte carlo step ( mcs ) , is defined as @xmath46 exchange attempts , the total number of sites in the lattice . for sake of simplicity , we use the mcs as the unit of  time \" in what follows .",
    "in fact , the random sampling of spins , and the immediate dissipation of their energy ( perfectly local , both in time and space ) imply that the correspondence with real time is not straightforward @xcite .    in this model",
    "the simulation temperature @xmath38 relates to active cell membrane motion .",
    "higher @xmath38 implies higher membrane activity and vice - versa .",

    "rounding was investigated using as initial states elliptical aggregates with different numbers of cells : 544 , 953 , 1642 , 2204 , and 3233 cells .",
    "cells areas have approximately 100 lattice sites and cell - medium surface tensions have values : 4.5 , 5.5 , 6.5 , 7.5 , 8.5 , 9.5 . to generate these surface tensions",
    "we keep constant the interaction energy between cells , @xmath41=1 , and vary the energy between cells and medium , @xmath47 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 .",
    "the simulation temperature used is 10 and @xmath48 . for aggregates with 1642 cells we simulated all of the above surface tensions , however for other aggregate sizes we studied only the three lower values of surface tension . in figs .",
    "3a and 3b we show , respectively , the initial and final state ( complete rounding - up ) of the simulated aggregate with 544 cells .",
    "we calculate the deformation in the simulated aggregates using the ratio of the eigenvalues of the two dimensional variance of mass distribution of the aggregate that is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the coordinates of all lattice sites belonging to cells in the aggregate . as the aggregate rounds , the ratio between the two eigenvalues of the matrix above",
    ", @xmath52 and @xmath53 goes to 1 . in analogy with experimental studies ,",
    "we define aggregate deformation using the ratio between the larger and lower eigenvalues of the matrix minus one : @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "this measure of the deformation differs from that used in the experiments but should yield the same exponential decay .    in fig .",

    "6 , we determined that the slope for simulation is about 2.5 and for chicken data is about 1.5 ( see also fit in fig .",
    "simulation exponent seems robust to variations in temperature and surface tension . in both cases",
    "the results suggest a deviation from hydrodynamics .",
    "we have presented new experimental results on the relaxation of biological cell aggregates ( chick embryonic neural retina aggregates ) . our motivation was to measure the equivalent viscosity of this tissue .",
    "such measurements are important to characterize cell adhesiveness and to provide model parameters for theoretical or numerical models of collective motion @xcite .",
    "the relaxation of 3d aggregates is exponential , however , contrary to 2d aggregates of hydra cells @xcite , relaxation time seems to increase faster than linearly with aggregate size .",
    "we are currently working on the verification of this experimental dependence in case of 3d aggregates . to this end",
    ", we need to improve the experimental environment ( c0@xmath58 and 0@xmath58 control ) in order to increase the observation time to a few days and be able to study larger aggregates .",
    "it should be also noted that 2d results suffer large errors . however if this dependence is confirmed , the reason why 2d hydra aggregates behave as viscous fluid but not the 3d chick aggregates is not completely clear .",
    "the answer may arise from cell trajectory studies . in case of 2d hydra aggregates , all cells participated to rounding , motion was very collective @xcite .",
    "we have not performed a similar study yet but it seems that in larger 3d aggregates , intense cell movements occur mainly in the aggregate periphery in a band of a few cell diameter while in the core of the aggregate cells are less active . assuming nevertheless a fluid behavior , we obtain the following estimate for the tissue viscosity of 9 day old neural retina , @xmath59 pa.s .",
    "a simple potts model simulation of the phenomena captures the exponential decay and indicates a superlinear dependence of relaxation time with aggregate size as observed in experiments with chicken cells .",
    "the simulation exponent , however does not agree with experiments but a possible explanation for the difference may come from cell trajectory studies .",
