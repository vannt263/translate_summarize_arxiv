    "dolzhansky  @xcite explains clearly how a special choice of 3-d vector basis for both velocity and magnetic field leads to the kirchhoff equations , a sixth order ode describing the motion of an ellipsoid immersed in fluid .",
    "the difficulty with the 3-d vector basis is that it requires initial current distributions corresponding to the linear magnetic field that are not easy to realise in practice .",
    "it is possible to conceive that an ellipsoidal blob of uniform vorticity might somehow appear , indeed an _ elliptical _",
    "blob , embedded in a 2-d potential flow was proposed by helmholtz in  1889 as a model for a tornado  @xcite .",
    "however , it strains the imagination as to how an isolated _ ellipsoidal _ current distribution might be spontaneously produced .",
    "arter  @xcite pointed out that the cartesian linear fields could be regarded as the truncation of a taylor series expansion solution in position to first order .",
    "thus a problem with boundary conditions at a finite distance from the origin might be formulated , by allowing higher order taylor terms to help say fix the current on a flat surface at distance  @xmath14 rather than on the problematic ellipsoidal surface . substituting the higher order terms in the governing partial differential equations  ( pdes )",
