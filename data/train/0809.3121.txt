    "in recent years the bifurcations occurring in switching dynamical systems have been the subject of great interest , as it is known that many physical , engineering and biological systems actually embody continuous - time evolution punctuated by discrete switching events . under stroboscopic sampling",
    "these switching dynamical systems in general yield maps that have a discontinuity in the derivative along subspaces or `` borderlines '' that divide the phase space into two or more compartments . in these",
    "piecewise smooth ( pws ) maps a new type of bifurcation , called border collision bifurcation @xcite occurs when a fixed point collides with a borderline , resulting in a sudden change in the jacobian matrix .",
    "most recent studies on border collision bifurcations have been done on piecewise smooth maps that are continuous across the borderline @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that many switching dynamical systems yield maps that not only have a discontinuity in the derivative , but also a discontinuity in the function itself .",
    "discontinuity in the map arises if , in the @xmath0 dimensional poincar section there exists an @xmath1 dimensional manifold such that infinitesimally close points at the two sides of the manifold map to points that are far apart . a few electronic circuits exhibiting one - dimensional discontinuous maps was given in @xcite .",
    "the bifurcation theory for such one - dimensional discontinuous maps have been developed @xcite , and have been successfully applied in analyzing bifurcations in physical systems @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years there has been evidence that many physical systems yield two - dimensional ( 2d ) discontinuous maps . for example , the classical impact oscillator yields a 2d discontinuous map if the impacting surface moves following a nonsmooth function @xcite . the static var controller used in electrical power systems",
    "@xcite also has its dynamics given by a 2d discontinuous map .",
    "it has also been found that the dynamics of spiking bursting activities of real biological neurons @xcite as well as some business cycle models @xcite can be represented by 2d piecewise smooth discontinuous maps .",
    "therefore , to explain the bifurcation phenomena in such systems , it is necessary to have a bifurcation theory for 2d piecewise smooth discontinuous maps .",
    "the bifurcation theory for 1d and 2d continuous piecewise smooth maps is well developed @xcite .",
    "the results related to the existence of period-1 and period-2 orbits in general @xmath0-dimensional pws maps @xcite have also been applied in practical systems .",
    "bifurcation theory for 1d discontinuous maps has been reported @xcite . in the context of general @xmath0-dimensional discontinuous maps ,",
    "some important results related to the existence of period-1 orbits @xcite and period-2 orbits @xcite have been published recently .",
    "for the special case of @xmath2 , these theories can be applied to obtain the conditions of existence of period-1 and period-2 fixed points .",
    "however in the context of a specific dynamical system , one is often interested in the asymptotically stable behavior , which can not be inferred from the available theory .",
    "it has to be obtained through the analysis of the existence and stability of periodic orbits and their stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "our investigations along this line showed that the two - dimensional discontinuous map is a source of incredibly rich dynamical behavior , created by complicated interactions between the stable and unstable manifolds of fixed points and the line of discontinuity . in this paper",
    "we report some results of this investigation , and we hope that these will pave way for further investigation on the dynamics of two - dimensional discontinuous maps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present an example of a physical system that yields a discontinuous map , and illustrate the peculiar dynamics exhibited by this system . as in the study of continuous piecewise smooth systems",
    ", we use the piecewise linear normal form representing the behavior of the system in the neighborhood of the border - crossing fixed point , which is introduced in section  3 .",
    "then in section  4 we develop a classification of the bifurcation scenarios observed in this map , depending on the type of the fixed points at the two sides of the border .",

    "the two switches operate in the alternate half - cycles , and are turned on by applying pulses at a phase angle @xmath14 with respect to the sinusoidal input @xmath15 .",

    "[ shooting ] ) , it is found that there is no fixed point in those parameter ranges .",
    "even though there is no fixed point , the orbit remains bounded and high periodic orbits occur in a specific order ( see the zoomed portion in fig .",
    "[ svar - bif](b ) ) .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop the theory necessary to explain such atypical bifurcation behavior in physical systems .",
    "many hybrid dynamical systems can be represented in discrete - time by piecewise smooth maps , given by equations of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the bifurcation parameter and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are regions in the state space , divided by a borderline .",
    "we consider the class of maps that have the following properties :    1 .",
    "the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are smooth ( everywhere differentiable ) , 2 .",
    "the function @xmath37 is discontinuous across the borderline , 3 .",
    "the elements of the jacobian matrix of @xmath37 change discretely across the borderline , 4 .",
    "the jacobian elements are finite .",
    "maps of the above properties have application in many physical and engineering systems ( the system described in section  [ var ] provides an example ) , and in the present paper we restrict our attention to such maps .",
    "the normal form for such a piecewise smooth system in the neighborhood of a fixed point on the border can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the traces and @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the determinants of the jacobian matrices at the two sides of the border .",
    "the similar normal form of the piecewise smooth continuous map was derived in @xcite .",
    "we have added the discontinuity @xmath43 to obtain the normal form for the 2d discontinuous map .",
    "we shall call the two halves of the state space @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .    in order to explain the bifurcations in a specific system",
    ", one has to obtain the eigenvalues of the fixed points at the two sides of the borderline , and from that , the values of the trace and the determinant .",
    "for example , in the case of the static var compensation system described in section  [ var ] , the calculation of the floquet exponents at @xmath48 yielded @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the explanation of the observed bifurcations have to be obtained by analyzing the behavior of the normal form map for these parameter values .",
    "the fixed points of the system ( [ eq : normal - map ] ) in both sides of the boundary are given by : @xmath53 if the @xmath28-component of @xmath54 is negative , the fixed point exists .",
    "else it does not .",
    "however , when the @xmath28-component of @xmath54 is positive , iterations from initial conditions in the left half are influenced by the `` nonexistent '' fixed point , which is called a `` virtual '' fixed point , and is denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , when the @xmath28-component of @xmath56 is positive , the fixed point exists ; else it is a virtual fixed point denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "the stability of @xmath54 and @xmath56 are determined by the eigenvalues @xmath58    we shall confine our studies to dissipative systems , so that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , we shall be concentrating on positive determinant systems because most physical systems are observed to yield maps with positive determinant .",
    "for such a map , there can be four basic types of fixed points :    1 .   when @xmath61 , both eigenvalues of the jacobian are complex , with moduli less than @xmath62 , indicating that the fixed point is a * spiral attractor*. if @xmath63 ( real part positive ) , it is a clockwise spiral , and if @xmath64 ( real part negative ) , the motion is counter - clockwise .",
    "2 .   when @xmath65 and @xmath66 , both eigenvalues are real and are less than @xmath62 in magnitude , causing the fixed point to be an * attractor*. if @xmath67 , then we have @xmath68 , so that the attractor is a * flip attractor * ( flips in _ both _ directions ) .",
    "if @xmath69 , then @xmath70 and the fixed point is a * regular attractor*. 3 .   if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 and @xmath73 , so that the fixed point is a * flip saddle * ( flips in _ both _ direction ) .",
    "4 .   if @xmath74 , then @xmath75 and @xmath76 , so that the fixed point is a * regular saddle*.    earlier work of pws maps @xcite demonstrated a property of the normal form map that the unstable manifolds fold at every intersection with the @xmath28-axis , and the image of every fold point is a fold point .",
    "the stable manifolds fold at every intersection with the @xmath77-axis and the pre - image of every fold point is a fold point @xcite . in case of the discontinuous map ,",
    "the same property holds ; the only difference is that the folds are also discontinuous .",
    "we now classify the different types of discontinuous border collision bifurcations depending on the type of fixed points occurring at the two sides of the border .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we shall study the bifurcations occurring in the system ( [ eq : normal - map ] ) as the parameter @xmath32 is varied .",
    "note that while in a continuous map ( @xmath78 ) border collision occurs at a single value of @xmath32 , in the discontinuous case ( @xmath79 ) border collision occurs at two values @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "note also that the structure of the map is different for positive and negative values of @xmath43 .",
    "so in the subsequent sections we shall consider the bifurcations for positive and negative values of @xmath43 separately .",
    "if a certain parameter combination exhibits a certain kind of bifurcation behavior upon varying @xmath32 in one direction , then interchanging the parameter values of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 sides will yield the _ same _ bifurcation behavior upon varying @xmath32 in the reverse direction , i.e. , interchanging parameter values is _ qualitatively _ mirror - symmetric with respect to the bifurcation behavior .",
    "we now take up each case in the following subsections .      since both the fixed points are unstable ,",
    "in most situations the orbits starting from all initial conditions go to infinity .",

    "the state therefore gets _ locked _ between the two saddles , and this results in a bounded orbit .",
    "a similar behavior is seen for an initial state in @xmath47 to the _ left _ of @xmath93 .",

    "the chaotic attractor is stable as long as the unstable manifolds do not map to states outside the basin of attraction formed by @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "we will follow the same notations in the subsequent sections .",
