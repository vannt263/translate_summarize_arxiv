    "an exact identification of the mechanism responsible for color confinement , and of the effective degrees of freedom relevant to it , is still missing .",
    "a commonly accepted scenario is that such degrees of freedom must be of dual , topological nature .",
    "a possible proposed mechanism is that based on dual superconductivity  @xcite , i.e. on the idea that the qcd vacuum is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of a magnetic symmetry , induced by the condensation of magnetically charged defects .",
    "possible approaches , followed to test this mechanism by lattice simulations , have either checked for the spontaneous symmetry breaking , by looking at the vacuum expectation value of magnetically charged operators and at the effective action of monopole configurations  @xcite , or have looked at the properties of monopole configurations extracted from non - abelian configurations generated at equilibrium .",
    "the identification of abelian degrees of freedom in non - abelian gauge theories , and of abelian monopoles in particular , relies on a procedure known as abelian projection , which is based on the choice of an adjoint field .",
    "since no natural adjoint field exists in qcd , that implies some arbitrariness . a popular choice is to perform the projection in the so - called maximal abelian gauge ( mag ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that topological degrees of freedom , which are responsible for color confinement , play a relevant role also at and around the deconfinement transition .",
    "indeed , magnetic monopoles evaporating from the low temperature magnetic condensate , which are usually known as thermal monopoles , have been advocated for their possible role in the properties of strongly interacting matter above the deconfinement transition  @xcite thermal monopoles are identified , in lattice qcd simulations at finite temperature , by looking for monopole currents with non - trivial wrappings in the euclidean temporal direction  @xcite .",
    "systematic lattice studies , regarding the properties of thermal monopoles in the deconfined phase of @xmath2 yang - mills theory have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "results for the @xmath2 gauge theory have shown several interesting properties of such objects , which are compatible with a scenario in which the magnetic component of the quark - gluon plasma plays a significant role right above the deconfinement temperature , while it is less relevant at asymptotically high temperatures , where the plasma is electrically dominated  @xcite . in particular , spatial correlations of thermal monopoles show the presence of coulomb - like , screened interactions among monopoles and antimonopoles  @xcite , with an effective magnetic coupling which grows in the high @xmath5 regime  @xcite , where the density of monopoles is also logarithmically suppressed with respect to the electric component .",
    "on the contrary , the coupling decreases approaching the low @xmath5 regime , and the analysis of the statistical distribution of trajectories with multiple wrappings in the temporal direction  @xcite suggests that thermal monopoles may condense at a temperature which coincides , within errors , with the deconfinement temperature , giving further support to a confinement mechanism based on the condensation of magnetic charges .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to extend such investigation to the pure gauge theory with three colors ; preliminary results in the same direction have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be discussed in the following .",
    "the maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath0 gauge theories is @xmath6 , hence the main change , when going to @xmath7 , is that various abelian charges , i.e. various different species of monopoles , can be identified . on one hand , that makes a proper extension of the definition of the maximal abelian gauge less trivial . on the other hand ,",
    "new properties appear , associated with the interactions among different monopole species .",

    "numerical results obtained for thermal monopoles in the deconfined phase of @xmath1 will be presented and discussed in section  [ monden ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ discon ] , we draw our conclusions . technical details and comparison among different definitions of mag are reported in appendixes  [ magalg ] , [ takediag ] and [ tlachange ] .",
    "in the following we shall review the definition of abelian projection and of abelian magnetic monopoles in @xmath0 gauge theories .",

    "the usual rationale behind the use of the mag projection is that , since the sum of the squared diagonal elements is maximized , abelian projected fields retain most of the original yang - mills dynamics ( abelian dominance ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such choice is supported by the empirical fact that the physical properties of mag monopoles show a negligible dependence on the lattice ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff .",
    "an important property of the maximal abelian gauge is that magnetic currents , defined through the violation of the non - abelian bianchi identities , are correctly identified and magnetic charge obeys the correct dirac quantization condition  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a related numerical study ) . in view of this ,",
    "in the following we shall adopt the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "however , the extension of the definition to the generic @xmath0 gauge group reveals ambiguous and various possibilities exist : in the following we shall discuss which of them are suitable for a correct definition of magnetic charges , in the light of the arguments given in sections  [ 2a ] and [ 2b ] .    a possible , straightforward generalization for @xmath1 , introduced in ref .",

    "the original aim of abelian projection is to fix the non - abelian gauge symmetry apart from a residual maximal @xmath111 abelian subgroup , to which @xmath31 electric and magnetic charges can be associated .",
    "the need for fixing the @xmath112 @xmath4 subgroups simultaneously , _",
    "i.e.  _ by the same gauge condition , stems from the requirement that each electric or magnetic charge be neutral with respect to all other @xmath4 subgroups .",

    "( [ magsu3_1 ] ) may work equally well , even if no diagonal operator is naturally associated to such a choice .",

    "such residual symmetry , unfortunately , makes it ambiguous to identify in which subgroup a given magnetic monopole appears .",
    "a direct consequence , that will be verified numerically in the next subsection , is that when one constructs magnetic currents according to the abelian projected phases in such a gauge , magnetic monopoles appear simultaneously on the same site and in different @xmath4 subgroups , meaning that the magnetic charge operators are not well identified , _",
