    "fluid adsorption in wedge and cone - shaped non - planar geometries has attracted much attention in the last few years @xcite .",
    "geometry plays an important role in the surface phase diagram , and new phase transitions as the filling transition arise .",
    "thermodynamic considerations @xcite predict that the gas - liquid interface unbinds from the wedge before the wetting temperature @xmath0 corresponding to the substrates .",
    "so , the wedge is completely filled by liquid for temperatures higher than the filling temperature @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is given by the condition : @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the temperature - dependent contact angle of a liquid drop on the planar substrate .",
    "capillary wave models show that the filling transition can be critical even though the wetting transition corresponding to the substrate is first order , and that interfacial fluctuations are enhanced with respect to the wetting case @xcite . for the 2d wedge filling transition in shallow wedges characterized by an small angle @xmath5 respect to the @xmath6 axis ( see below ) ,",
    "there exists a remarkable covariance relationship between the wedge midpoint probability distribution function @xmath7 in the filling fluctuation regime and the planar @xmath8point probability distribution function @xmath9 characteristic of a strong - fluctuation regime critical wetting transition : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the contact angle of the liquid droplet on the substrate .",
    "this expression establishes a connection between two apparently unrelated phenomena , the deep origin of which is still elusive .",
    "the covariance relationship has been observed also in acute wedges @xcite , ising model exact calculations @xcite and computer simulations @xcite .",
    "although the covariance relationship is restricted to the interfacial behavior above the wedge midpoint , some other quantities like the local susceptibility , which is related to the @xmath12point correlation function , also showed a modified covariance relationship @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is interesting to see if the covariance extends to higher - order probability distribution functions .    in this paper",
    "we study the structure of the interfacial profile and correlations for 2d wedge filling phenomena .",
    "exact results for the capillary wave effective hamiltonian theory in the filling fluctuation regime are obtained as an extension of the analysis presented in ref .",
    "the exact results show the appearance of a new length scale @xmath13 across the wedge close to the critical filling transition .",
    "this scale controls the decay of the interfacial profile , local roughness and correlations , and is related geometrically to the wedge midpoint average interface position . for the local properties , we found a very interesting relationship between the wedge @xmath8point probability distribution function and the corresponding functions in the planar geometry , which can enlighten the origin of the wedge covariance .",
    "regarding the two - point correlation functions , we found a confirmation in the scaling limit of the _ breather mode _ picture @xcite , which states that the interface is effectively infinitely stiff in the filled region and is driven by fluctuations of the wedge midpoint interfacial position , i.e. critical effects at 2d wedge filling arise simply from local translations in the height of the flat , filled interfacial region .",
    "finally , we explain the critical behavior of the filling transition in the functional renormalization group approach . as the geometry is fundamental in the understanding of the critical filling transition",
    ", we choose a scheme that leaves the wedge geometry invariant .",
    "we show that the breather mode picture emerges as a straightforward consequence .",
    "the predictions for the critical behavior are in complete agreement with exact solutions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the continuous transfer matrix formalism and the definition of the wedge @xmath14point interfacial probability distribution functions .",
    "we apply this formalism to the case of contact binding potentials in section [ sec3 ] and in particular calculate analytically the @xmath8point probability distribution function and the @xmath12point correlation functions .",
    "some results for kratzer binding potentials will be presented in section [ sec4 ] . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we analyse the breather mode picture and derive a relation between two important scaling functions .",
    "section [ sec6 ] is devoted to the development of a renormalization group theory of 2d critical filling transition , which requires a generalization of previous approaches for critical wetting .",
    "a brief conclusion is presented in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "consider a two - dimensional wedge formed by the intersection of two equal planar substrates at angles @xmath15 to the horizontal ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . we suppose that the wedge is in contact with a bulk vapor phase at saturation conditions , i.e. in equilibrium with the liquid phase , and the substrates preferentially adsorb the liquid phase .",
    "our starting point is the effective interfacial hamiltonian for shallow wedges : @xmath16=\\int_{-x/2}^{x/2 } dx \\left\\{\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx } \\right)^2+w(y(x)-\\alpha|x|)\\right\\ } \\label{hameff}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the interfacial local height respect to the horizontal , @xmath18 is the interfacial horizontal length , @xmath19 is the interfacial stiffness , @xmath20 is the local binding potential and @xmath21 .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions at the ends , i.e. @xmath22 .     and @xmath23 are also highlighted .",
    "other notation is defined in the text.[fig1],width=325 ]    defining the local relative height between the vapor - liquid interface and the substrate @xmath24 , eq.([hameff ] ) can be rewritten as @xcite : @xmath25&=&x \\frac{\\sigma \\alpha^2}{2}+   \\int_{-x/2}^{x/2 } dx \\bigg\\{\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\left(\\frac{dl}{dx } \\right)^2\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sigma \\alpha \\left(\\frac{dl}{dx}\\right)(2h(x)-1 ) + w(l(x))\\bigg\\ } \\label{hameff2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the heaviside step function . integrating by parts to eliminate the term proportional to @xmath27 , the effective hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath25&= & x \\frac{\\sigma \\alpha^2}{2}+ 2\\sigma \\alpha l(x/2)- 2\\sigma \\alpha l(0 )   \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\int_{-x/2}^{x/2 } dx \\left\\{\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\left(\\frac{dl}{dx } \\right)^2 + w(l(x))\\right\\ } \\label{hameff3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first two terms in the equation are irrelevant constants for the interfacial properties in the wedge , the third one is the origin of the boost factor that decreases the pinning effect of the binding potential @xcite , and the fourth one corresponds to the effective hamiltonian of an equivalent planar interface problem . as the probability distribution of an interfacial configuration is proportional to @xmath28 we can relate the wedge and planar probability distributions in a straightforward way .",
    "in particular , the @xmath14point wedge correlation functions can be related to @xmath29point correlation functions in the planar case by adding the wedge midpoint position .",
    "however , the presence of the boost factor will alter significally the behavior of the wedge correlation functions with respect to their planar counterparts .",

    "another interesting case is the kratzer binding potential @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and we assume dirichlet boundary conditions at the origin .",

    "the wedge midpoint @xmath8point probability distribution function becomes more and more peaked around zero as @xmath255 , converging to the low temperature fixed point : @xmath425 these results imply that there is a relevant field ( in the rg sense ) associated with @xmath426 . actually , the only other relevant operator is @xmath427 , where @xmath428 is the chemical potential and @xmath429 the value at gas - liquid coexistence .",
    "recall that the critical exponents defined at coexistence ( @xmath430 ) : @xmath431 where @xmath432 and @xmath2 is the critical filling temperature .",
    "close to a critical filling fixed point ( for any @xmath415 ) , all the relevant scale lengths @xmath323 , @xmath433 , @xmath89 , @xmath434 , etc .",
    "are reduced by a factor @xmath435 . to extract the dependence on @xmath436 we need to know the largest eigenvalue of the linearized rg flow close to the critical fixed point .",
    "we argued above that this eigenvalue is associated to the transformation of the @xmath66 term of the hamiltonian @xmath437 .",
    "we again considered the special hamiltonians eq .",
    "( [ specialham ] ) for contact and kratzer binding potentials .",
    "the expression of @xmath437 for these potentials is : @xmath438 taking into account how @xmath437 renormalizes , and its expression at the critical fixed point ( see eq .",
    "( [ fixedpoint ] ) ) , it is clear that the largest eigenvalue is @xmath336 , and its associated eigenfunction is proportional to @xmath439 . as a consequence , the critical exponents @xmath440 for both the filling fluctuation and marginal regimes .    to get the leading singularity for the wedge excess free energy is more complicated . as @xmath395 remains invariant under the rg transformations , @xmath441",
    "however , this value does not rule out a logarithmic divergence in @xmath442 . in order to get such a dependence , we use the following thermodynamic relationship : @xmath443",
    "where the derivative is made without changing @xmath387 or any characteristic of the binding potential ( in particular the contact angle ) .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ thermodyn ] ) as : @xmath444 after a renormalization step , we know that , even when @xmath387 and the binding potential have changed , this derivative changes as @xmath435 since @xmath395 , @xmath11 and @xmath5 are invariant , and @xmath323 and @xmath445 decrease by a factor @xmath435 . if we regard @xmath446 ( @xmath447 , and recall that @xmath448 is invariant under a rg step ) as proportional to @xmath436 when the flow is close to the critical fixed point , eq .",
    "( [ thermodyn2 ] ) implies that @xmath395 diverges logarithmically as @xmath449 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath395 is invariant under renormalization and must vanish as @xmath450 .",
    "consequently close to the filling transition it must be proportional dependence to @xmath451 .",
    "the critical exponents obtained for the critical filling transition are in complete agreement with exact calculations and scaling arguments @xcite .",
    "the structure of the gas - liquid interface bound at a 2d wedge and close to the filling transition has been studied using exact transfer - matrix methods .",
    "these calculations show the emergence of a new correlation length @xmath13 sufficiently close to the phase boundary ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "the explicit transfer matrix results for correlation functions and interfacial roughness completely support the breather mode picture of fluctuation effects .",
    "the same picture also emerges of a renormalization group approach that leaves the wedge geometry invariant .",
    "the fact that the only relevant fluctuations are those that translate the midpoint interfacial height leads to a simple relationship between the interfacial structure and midpoint height probability distribution function in the scaling limit .",
    "the extension of this approach to higher dimensions and/or different geometries would be very interesting and further work is being carried out in that direction .    finally it would be instructive to understand the physical origin of the covariance relationship eq .",
    "( [ covariance ] ) . in the filling fluctuation regime",
    "we found that covariance can be inferred from the existence of the differential relation eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq1 ] ) and some regularity conditions .",
    "the very existence of such a field equation is itself indicative that some unknown symmetry relates wetting and filling transitions .",
    "further work is required to elucidate whether any such hidden symmetry exists .",
