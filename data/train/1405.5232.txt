    "dark energy ( de ) seems to play an important role of an agent that drives the present acceleration of the universe with the help of large negative pressure .",
    "an effective viscous pressure can also play its role to develop the dynamical history of an expanding universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is found @xcite that viscosity effects are viable at low redshifts , which observe negative pressure for the cosmic expansion with suitable viscosity coefficients . in general , the universe inherits dissipative processes @xcite , but perfect fluid is an ideal fluid with zero viscosity .",
    "although , perfect fluid is mostly used to model the idealized distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "this fluid in equilibrium generates no entropy and no frictional type heat because its dynamics is reversible and without dissipation .",
    "the dissipative processes mostly include bulk and shear viscosities .",
    "the bulk viscosity is related with an isotropic universe whereas the shear viscosity works with anisotropy of the universe .",
    "the cmbr observations indicate an isotropic universe , leading to bulk viscosity where the shear viscosity is neglected @xcite .",
    "long before the direct observational evidence through the sn ia data , the indication of a viscosity dominated late epoch of accelerating expansion of the universe was already mentioned @xcite .",
    "the origin of the bulk viscosity in a physical system is due to its deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "thus the existence of bulk viscosity may arise the concept of accelerating expansion of the universe due to the collection of those states which are not in thermal equilibrium for a small fraction of time @xcite .",
    "these states are the consequence of fluid expansion ( or contraction ) .",
    "the system does not have enough time to restore its equilibrium position , hence an effective pressure takes part in restoring the system to its thermal equilibrium .",
    "the measurement of this effective pressure is the bulk viscosity which vanishes when it restores its equilibrium @xcite-@xcite .",
    "so , it is natural to assume the existence of a bulk viscous coefficient in a more realistic description of the accelerated universe today .    physically , the bulk viscosity is considered as an internal friction due to different cooling rates in an expanding gas .",
    "its dissipation reduces the effective pressure in an expanding fluid by converting kinetic energy of the particles into heat .",
    "thus , it is natural to think of the bulk viscous pressure as one of the possible mechanism that can accelerate the universe today .",
    "however , this idea needs a viable mechanism for the origin of the bulk viscosity , although there are many proposed best fit models .",
    "many models have been suggested to discuss the vague nature of de . during the last decade , the holographic dark energy ( hde ) , new agegraphic dark energy ( nade ) , their entropy corrected versions and correspondence with other de models have received a lot of attention .",
    "the hde model is based on the holographic principle which states that _ the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and has a relationship with the area of its boundary _ @xcite . moreover , in order to reconcile the validity of an effective local quantum field , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite provided a relationship between the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) cutoffs on the basis of limit set by the formation of a black hole .",

    "the length measure is taken as the conformal time instead of age of the universe and its energy density is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the conformal time .",
    "the causality problem occurs in the usual hde model , while it is avoided here .",
    "many people have explored the viability of this model through different observations @xcite-@xcite .",

    "linder @xcite investigated the expansion of the universe in this theory .",
    "he observed that power - law model depends upon its parameter while exponential model acts like cosmological model at high redshift .",
    "bamba et al .",
    "@xcite discussed the eos parameter for exponential , logarithmic as well as combination of these @xmath0 models and they concluded that the crossing of phantom divide line is observed in combined model only .",
    "karami and abdolmaleki @xcite constructed this parameter for hde , nade and their entropy corrected models in the framework of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "they found that the universe lies in phantom or quintessence phase for the first two models whereas phantom crossing is achieved in entropy corrected models .",
    "sharif and rani @xcite described the graphical representation of k - essence in this modified gravity with the help of eos parameter . some other authors @xcite explored the expansion of the universe with different techniques in @xmath0 gravity .",

    "the scheme of paper is as follows : section * 2 * provides basic formalism and discussion about the field equations of @xmath0 gravity . in section * 3 * , the viscous eos parameter is constructed for different de models . also , we discuss the graphical behavior of this parameter for these models .",
