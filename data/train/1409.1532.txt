    "the concept of time delay plays an important and special role in quantum collision theory .",
    "it was first introduced by eisenbud and wigner @xcite in the context of elastic scattering , who related the time during which a monochromatic wave packet is delayed in the interaction region to the energy derivative of the scattering phase shift .",
    "later on smith @xcite extended the concept to the case of inelastic scattering with many channels and introduced the time - delay ( or wigner - smith ) matrix @xmath1 \\big\\vert_{\\epsilon=0 } \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the scattering matrix at energy @xmath3 whose dimension is given by the number of open channels , @xmath4 .",
    "for an energy and flux conserving scatterer ( _ i.e. _  involving no absorption or dissipation ) , the @xmath5-matrix is unitary and @xmath0 is a hermitian matrix , which is manifest from the second representation in .",
    "the real characteristics of @xmath0 ( _ e.g. _  its diagonal elements and eigenvalues ) provide us with various time - delay related observables @xcite . taking the trace ,",
    "one arrives at the simple weighted - mean measure of the collision duration @xcite @xmath6 this expression defines the wigner time delay in multi - channel scattering .",
    "further and more subtle discussions of the physical concepts of time delays and their applications to regular and chaotic scattering can be found in recent reviews @xcite .    as is clear from the definition , the dominant contributions to @xmath7 come from the regions where the total scattering phase shift exhibits a sharp energy dependence .",
    "away from the channel thresholds , this occurs in the vicinity of resonances that correspond to the meta - stable ( decaying ) states formed at the intermediate stage of the scattering event .",
    "such resonances can be analytically viewed as the complex poles @xmath8 of the @xmath5-matrix in the complex energy plane , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the position and width of the @xmath11th resonance , respectively . in the resonance approximation , neglecting the constant background connected to potential scattering and direct reactions , these poles are the only singularities of @xmath5 . in view of the unitarity condition , their complex conjugates @xmath12 serve as the @xmath5-matrix zeros , thus implying @xmath13 .",
    "this results in the important connection @xcite @xmath14 between the wigner time delay and the resonance spectrum of the intermediate open system .",
    "this expression is valid at arbitrary degree of the resonance overlap and thus the winger time delay can also be treated as the density of states of the open system , see @xcite for relevant discussion . in particular ,",
    "the spectral average of @xmath7 over a narrow energy window is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean density around @xmath3 .",
    "the latter in turn determines the fundamental timescale in quantum systems , the heisenberg time @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 .    in many experimental situations",
    ", the intermediate system is characterised by very complicated internal motion , with representative examples being microwave cavities @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and compound nuclei @xcite . as a result , the time delay ( as well as other scattering observables ) reveals strong fluctuations around its mean value that need to be treated statistically .",
    "there are two main approaches to describe such fluctuations : random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite and the semiclassical method @xcite .",
    "the general rmt approach to the time delay , mostly developed in @xcite , is based on a representation of the wigner - smith matrix in terms of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath19 of the open system .",
    "the complex resonances @xmath20 are then given by the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the hermitian part of @xmath19 describes the internal hamiltonian with a discrete spectrum and chaotic dynamics .",
    "it can therefore be modelled by a random @xmath21 matrix drawn from the gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) or unitary ( gue ) ensemble , depending on the presence or absence of time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the anti - hermitian part originates from coupling between the @xmath22 internal and @xmath4 channels states and has a specific algebraic structure due to the unitarity constraint @xcite .",
    "the statistical averaging can then be performed by making use of the powerful supersymmetry technique , mapping the problem to a nonlinear supersymmetric @xmath23-model of zero - dimensional field theory @xcite . in the asymptotic limit @xmath24 , the obtained results are universal in the sense that local fluctuations on the scale of mean level spacing @xmath25 become model - independent provided that the appropriate natural units have been used @xcite .",
    "the only parameters are then the number @xmath4 of open channels and their strength of coupling to the continuum .",
    "the later is quantified by the average ` optical ' @xmath5-matrix , with @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) being the limiting case of a perfectly open ( or almost closed ) system .",
    "the exact universal results were initially obtained for the autocorrelation function of the wigner time delay , first for orthogonal @xcite and unitary symmetry @xcite , and then for the whole crossover of partly broken trs @xcite .",
    "along these lines , exact formulae were also derived for the distribution function of the _ partial _ time - delays @xcite ( defined by the energy derivatives of the @xmath5-matrix eigenphases and related to the diagonal elements of @xmath0 @xcite ) as well as that of the _ proper _ time - delays ( given by the eigenvalues of @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the developed method is actually flexible enough to also include the effects of finite absorption @xcite and disorder @xcite .",
    "the most recent overview of the relevant results can be found in @xcite .",
    "further progress is possible in the particular case of perfect coupling , when @xmath5 is uniformly distributed in dyson s circular ensemble of the appropriate symmetry @xcite .",
    "brouwer et al .",
    "@xcite exploited the invariance properties of the energy - dependent @xmath5-matrix in this case to derive the distribution of the whole time - delay matrix , generalising the earlier one - channel result @xcite to arbitrary @xmath4 .",
    "the joint distribution function of its eigenvalues , _",
    "i.e. _  the proper time - delays , turned out to be determined by the laguerre ensemble from rmt @xcite .",
    "this provided a route to apply orthogonal polynomials to compute marginal distributions @xcite and various moments @xcite or use a coulomb gas method to study the total density @xcite .",
    "very recently , mezzadri and simm @xcite applied the integrable theory of certain matrix integrals to the problem and developed an efficient method for computing cumulants of arbitrary order .",
    "in particular , the variance of the wigner time delay was found in the simple form , @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for a statistical average and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) indicates orthogonal ( unitary ) symmetry .",
    "this expression agrees with earlier results obtained at arbitrary coupling in @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the results for the distribution of wigner time delay are still rather limited , with explicit expressions being available only at @xmath32 @xcite or in the limit of @xmath33 @xcite .    taking a semiclassical approach , an early expression for the wigner time delay",
    "was derived through the connection to the density of states mentioned above .",
    "the fluctuating part of this quantity can be expressed , like gutzwiller s trace formula for closed systems @xcite , as a sum over periodic orbits , @xmath34 but now only involving those orbits trapped inside the scattering system @xcite .",
    "the trapped primitive orbits @xmath35 and their repetitions @xmath36 involve their actions @xmath37 and stability amplitudes @xmath38 which in turn depend on the period , monodromy matrix and maslov index of the orbits .",
    "since the dependence on the energy ( and other parameters ) is then encoded in the sum over the periodic orbits , this can be used to calculate correlation functions @xcite , in particular , the time - delay variance is expressed as @xmath39 when taking the semiclassical limit @xmath40 , the rapid oscillations in the phase induced will be washed out by the overall spectral averaging unless there are systematic correlations between periodic orbits with action difference @xmath41 .",
    "the repetitions have been ignored in since they are exponentially smaller than the @xmath42 term .",
    "the semiclassical treatment of sums like in then involves identifying and evaluating correlated pairs of orbits with a small action difference .",
    "the simplest pair is to set @xmath43 , known as the diagonal approximation @xcite , which can be evaluated using the open system version @xcite of the hannay - ozorio de almeida sum rule @xcite @xmath44 here the exponential weighting corresponds to the expected number of periodic orbits of the closed system which survive up to a time @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being the classical escape rate ( see , however , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "with trs , one can also pair an orbit with its time reverse and obtain a further factor of 2 , or @xmath47 thus reproducing to leading order .",
    "this is not surprising , of course , as the quasiclassical limit in the rmt treatment corresponds to the asymptotic case of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the quantum effects are encoded in the higher order terms of the @xmath48 expansion , being in general responsible for slowing down the decay law in chaotic systems from the purely exponential one @xcite .",
    "it is now well understood that the higher order terms can be obtained semiclassically through a systematic expansion of correlated periodic pairs which was first derived for the spectral statistics of closed systems @xcite . the extension to open systems and the time delay",
    "was then developed in @xcite , providing the terms up to @xmath49 in full agreement with the rmt result .",
    "further calculations along those lines become too involved because of the quickly growing complexity of relevant combinatorics .",
    "one possibility to overcome such difficulties might be in doing the semiclassical approximation at the level of the generating functions @xcite used to derive the corresponding @xmath23-model of rmt @xcite , the idea that has already proven to be success in establishing the full equivalence with rmt for the closed systems @xcite",
    ". however , we will exploit another route here .",
    "an alternative starting point relies on the van vleck approximation of the propagator that gives the semiclassical approximation for the scattering matrix elements @xcite in terms of trajectories that connect the corresponding ( say , input @xmath50 and output @xmath51 ) channels @xmath52 the scattering trajectories now have different stability amplitudes @xmath53 which do not explicitly depend on the duration @xmath54 of the trajectories but still include a phase factor . taking the energy derivative and noting that @xmath55 , one obtains the approximation for the wigner time delay @xcite @xmath56 where we have assumed that the amplitudes vary much more slowly than the phase .",
    "the diagonal approximation @xmath57 can again be evaluated with a sum rule @xcite @xmath58 which directly gives the average time delay .    in the presence of trs",
    "one can also partner a scattering trajectory with its time reverse if they start and end in the same channel .",
    "however there are further correlated pairs of trajectories , both with and without trs .",
    "they can be related to correlated pairs of periodic orbits by formally cutting the periodic orbits open and deforming them into scattering trajectories @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that the second form of the time - delay matrix in turns out to be particularly useful for the semiclassical treatment .",
    "one can show in this way @xcite that all further contributions to the average time delay cancel leaving only the diagonal terms intact .",
    "furthermore , one can also derive semiclassically from by recreating the sum over periodic orbits in from correlations of scattering trajectories that approach the trapped periodic orbits and follow them for many repetitions .",
    "this provides a duality between the two approaches and allows access to a range of statistics beyond the average time delay @xcite .",
    "for example , the moments of the proper time - delays can be found to leading order in @xmath59 by using energy - dependent correlators of the @xmath5-matrix elements and performing a semiclassical expansion for the later @xcite .",
    "the next two orders can similarly be obtained using a recursive graphical representation of the semiclassical diagrams of correlated trajectories @xcite , showing an agreement with rmt @xcite , though the energy dependence , which is later differentiated out and removed as in , complicates the treatment drastically .    in this paper , we derive yet another semiclassical approximation to the time delay which avoids using such an energy differentiation in the first place and significantly simplifies the semiclassical calculations .",
    "it builds upon the resonant representation @xcite of the matrix elements @xmath60 as the overlap of the internal parts @xmath61 of the scattering wave functions in the incident channels @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we note that with such a factorised form , calculations of the moments of the wigner time delay have some resemblance with those of the conductance and shot noise in the landauer - bttiker formalism of quantum transport @xcite .",
    "the statistics of the latter in chaotic cavities is determined by the jacobi ensembles of rmt @xcite , the exact expressions for their first two cumulants being derived in @xcite .",
    "transport moments of arbitrary order can be obtained most efficiently by exploiting the connection with the selberg integral @xcite , see further developments in @xcite as well as @xcite for other rmt studies on transport statistics .",
    "these results agreed with those from the semiclassical approach to quantum transport problems , as originally shown for the first two transport moments in @xcite and then generalized to an inverse channel expansion of all higher moments in @xcite . here",
    ", we provide for the first time a similar semiclassical justification of the laguerre ensembles of rmt .",
    "in particular , we derive the exact expression for the variance of wigner time delay semiclassically at any @xmath4 both for unitary and orthogonal symmetry",
    "( along with the other second moments of time - delays ) .",
    "we also extend previous work @xcite on establishing the universality for the moment generating functions .    in the next section ,",
    "we formulate our starting point and develop a semiclassical approximation to the internal parts @xmath64 and establish diagrammatic sum rules .",
    "this representation is then applied in to derive the second moments of time - delays at arbitrary @xmath4 .",
    "section  [ sec : momgenfuncs ] deals with the moment generating function of the proper time - delays and works out the algorithmic approach for the first five terms in a @xmath48-expansion .",
    "section  [ sec : concs ] summarises our findings .",
    "finally , we provide several appendices with more technical details of our calculations , including sums for systems with trs and a comparison to previous approaches , which we believe may be helpful for further development and applications of the method .",
    "in the general scattering formalism , the resonance part of the scattering matrix can be represented in terms of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian as follows @xcite : @xmath65 here , the hermitian @xmath66 matrix @xmath67 corresponds to the hamiltonian of the closed system , whereas the rectangular @xmath68 matrix @xmath69 consists of the decay amplitudes that couple @xmath22 discrete energy levels to @xmath4 decay channels .",
    "these amplitudes are commonly treated as energy - independent quantities , which can be justified by considering resonance phenomena away from the open channel thresholds . substituting into",
    ", one can readily find the representation of the wigner - smith matrix @xcite , @xmath70 in terms of the @xmath71 matrix @xmath72 .",
    "in such an approach , the energy dependence enters only via the resolvent @xmath73 that describes the propagation in the open system governed by @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath22-component vector @xmath74 ( _ i.e. _  the @xmath62th column of @xmath61 ) can therefore be treated @xcite as the intrinsic part of the scattering wave function initiated in the channel @xmath62 at energy @xmath3 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath75 are then given by the norm of @xmath64 , providing the interpretation as the average time delay of a wave packet in a given channel @xcite .",
    "taking the sum over the diagonal elements , we find that the wigner time delay is given by the total norm of the internal parts @xmath76 this norm is also known as the dwell time , thus the two time characteristics coincide in the resonance approximation considered .",
    "the factorized representation already proved @xcite to be successful for deriving the exact ( rmt ) distributions of the proper time - delays ( the eigenvalues of @xmath0 ) in chaotic cavities . on the other hand , the _ partial _ time - delays are defined by the energy derivative @xmath77 of the scattering eigenphases , @xmath78 .",
    "the exact distribution of the partial time - delays was found in @xcite .",
    "since the order of the diagonalisation and energy derivative is reversed for the proper and partial time - delays , they follow different statistics @xcite . in particular , for cavities with perfectly coupled leads ( the case of interest here ) the density of rates @xmath79 reduces to @xmath80 distribution characterised by the mean @xmath81 and the variance @xmath82 this should be compared with expression for @xmath83 that contains an extra factor @xmath84 , thus reflecting the self - averaging property of the linear statistic and diminishing correlations when @xmath4 grows .",
    "it is worth noting that the covariance of two partial time - delays can also be computed exactly with the help of their joint distribution found in @xcite , with the explicit result being @xmath85 more importantly , it was also shown in @xcite that at perfect coupling the statistical properties the partial time - delays become equivalent to those of the diagonal elements of the ` symmetrised ' wigner - smith matrix , @xmath86 , introduced and studied in @xcite . for the unitary case of systems without trs ,",
    "@xmath5 becomes statistically independent of @xmath0 @xcite and the symmetrisation process does not change the statistics of the diagonal elements so that @xmath87 also follow the same distribution , in particular , @xmath88 .",
    "this is not the case for the other symmetry classes .",
    "however , traces of @xmath0 and its powers are insensitive to such a symmetrisation , giving the identity @xmath89 \\ , .\\ ] ] equations and therefore readily yield the variance of the wigner time delay in the form of .",
    "likewise , we can arrive at the same result by using the variance @xcite and covariance @xcite of the proper time - delays . for later use",
    "we quote the relevant expression for the second moment @xcite @xmath90 the semiclassical approximation for the internal parts @xmath64 developed below determines these time - delay quantities in terms of certain scattering trajectories and thus allows us to study the universality of rmt predictions for individual systems .      in this section",
    "we derive a semiclassical approximation for the wigner time delay that is based on representation of the wigner - smith matrix @xmath0 .",
    "it is the third semiclassical approximation after and .",
    "the starting point is the green function @xmath91 of the open cavity with an arbitrary number of leads .",
    "its semiclassical approximation is a sum over all trajectories from @xmath92 to @xmath93 @xcite @xmath94 here , @xmath95 is the action along the trajectory @xmath96 , @xmath97 the number of conjugate points , and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) is the speed at initial ( final ) point ( for a cavity without potential @xmath100 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath101 denotes the stability matrix that describes linearised motion near the trajectory .",
    "it connects perpendicular deviations from the trajectory at the end point to those at the initial point",
    "@xmath102 formally , the effective hamiltonian @xmath19 of an open cavity is an infinite dimensional operator @xcite , corresponding to @xmath103 of the matrix truncation in and .",
    "the position representation of the resolvent @xmath73 can then be identified with the green function @xmath91 , whereas @xmath69 corresponds to a projection onto the transverse wavefunctions in the leads such that @xcite @xmath104 the integration is over the cross section at the beginning of the lead that contains the @xmath62th incoming mode , @xmath105 is the longitudinal velocity ( @xmath36 is the mass ) and @xmath106 is the lead width .",
    "the corresponding transverse wavefunction is @xmath107 note that @xmath108 labels the modes in all leads , whereas @xmath11 labels the modes in one particular lead , so the choice of the lead and @xmath11 depend on @xmath62 .",
    "the semiclassical approximation for the internal part @xmath109 follows by evaluating the integral in in stationary phase approximation . after writing the sine in as sum of two complex exponentials , the stationary phase condition reads @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "this fixes the starting angle of the trajectories ( @xmath112 ) entering the cavity . performing the stationary phase approximation results in @xmath113 where the sum runs over all trajectories that enter the cavity with the angle fixed by and end at @xmath93 .",
    "the amplitudes are given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the number of conjugate points for neighbouring trajectories with the same entrance angle .",
    "the expressions and allow us to represent the elements of the time - delay matrix in terms of the trajectories specified above .",
    "in particular , the semiclassical approximation for the wigner time delay follows from and as @xmath116 where the integral is over the interior of the cavity .",
    "this is the new representation for @xmath7 that serves as the starting point for the semiclassical calculations in this article .",
    "we first apply to calculate the mean time delay .",
    "the approximation sums over pairs of trajectories that contribute with highly oscillatory terms .",
    "after spectral averaging most terms can be neglected and the only remaining terms are from pairs of trajectories that are correlated .",
    "these pairs will be discussed in the following .",
    "the trajectories involved in are similar to those that occur in the semiclassics of the current density @xcite which in turn is related to the survival probability @xcite .",
    "the leading contribution to the average time delay comes from the diagonal approximation where @xmath117 : @xmath118 the evaluation of this expression requires a sum rule for the type of trajectories in ; see also @xcite for related sum rules . to obtain the sum rule",
    ", we fix one of the leads and consider the probability density that trajectories starting in the opening with angle @xmath119 and energy @xmath3 will arrive after time @xmath120 at point @xmath93 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the position in the opening , and the initial conditions of @xmath123 are determined by @xmath122 , @xmath119 and @xmath3 .",
    "the integral can be evaluated in local coordinates that are parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory , @xmath124 this sum runs over all trajectories and has wild oscillations which can be damped by a conventional smoothing of the delta - function @xmath125 .    in an open chaotic cavity with area @xmath126",
    "the asymptotic form of the probability density is @xmath127 as @xmath128 . here",
    "the exponential term describes the asymptotic escape of trajectories and the @xmath129 reflects the fact that each end point in the cavity is equally likely .",
    "we hence obtain the following sum rule @xmath130 note that channel @xmath62 corresponds to two angles @xmath119 which cancels a factor @xmath131 coming from . with this sum rule",
    "we can evaluate the diagonal approximation and obtain @xmath132 this is already the correct expression for the mean time delay .",
    "we will now show that off - diagonal contributions leave this result intact .",
    "off - diagonal contributions come from trajectories that have close _ self - encounters _ in which two or more stretches of the trajectory are almost parallel or anti - parallel @xcite .",
    "these trajectories have close neighbours that differ in the way in which the remaining longer parts of the trajectory , the _ links _ , are connected in the encounter regions .",
    "the simplest example is a trajectory with one encounter as shown in ( a ) .",
    "the neighbouring trajectory ( dashed line ) starts with the same angle @xmath119 and arrives at the same end point @xmath93 , but it traverses the loop in the opposite direction . for this reason these pairs exist only in systems with trs .",
    "for the evaluation of the semiclassical contribution of these orbits we follow @xcite .",
    "the encounter is described in a poincar surface of section in the encounter region .",
    "the relative distance of the two piercings of the original trajectory through the poincar surface is specified by coordinates @xmath133 and @xmath134 along the stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "this information is sufficient to determine the neighbouring trajectory and the action difference that is given by @xmath135 in the linearised approximation .",
    "the duration of the encounter region is specified by requiring that the distance of the two stretches of the trajectory along the stable and unstable directions remain smaller than some small constant @xmath62 , leading to @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the summation over the trajectory pairs is done by applying probabilistic arguments .",
    "let @xmath138 be the probability density in a chaotic system that a trajectory of long duration @xmath120 has a close self - encounter that is specified by coordinates @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "applying the sum rule and changing the integral over the orbit length @xmath120 to an integral over the third link duration results in @xmath142 equation contains a small correction to the sum rule that is necessary when applied to trajectories with self - encounters .",
    "namely , the trajectory time @xmath120 in the exponent has to be replaced by the _ exposure _ time that counts each encounter duration only once .",
    "the reason is that if a trajectory does not escape during the first traversal of an encounter region , it will not escape during subsequent traversals of this region .",
    "the integral over @xmath133 and @xmath134 can now be evaluated by noting that the only contribution that survives in the semiclassical limit is one where the encounter duration @xmath143 in the denominator is exactly cancelled by an encounter duration in the numerator . in other words , after expanding @xmath144 in a taylor series the only term that survives is the linear term in @xmath143 . with @xmath145 , we finally obtain @xmath146 where we have used @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the contribution would lead to a deviation from the correct result .",
    "there is , however , a further contribution of the same order .",
    "it arises from the so - called _ one - leg loops _ , which are correlated trajectories that have an end point in an encounter region as in ( b ) .",
    "these type of correlations do not occur in transport problems , but they arise when trajectories have one or both their end points in the cavity as for example in problems involving the survival probability , the current density or the fidelity @xcite .",
    "the encounter regions of one - leg loops require a different treatment than the usual encounters .",
    "it can be shown , however , that this difference can effectively be taken into account by adding a further factor of @xmath143 in the integral over @xmath133 and @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "so the contribution of the one - leg loop trajectories differs from by a missing integration over the third link time @xmath149 and an additional factor of @xmath143 , @xmath150 the integrals are then evaluated similarly as before and result in @xmath151 this contribution cancels exactly the contribution .",
    "one could further consider shrinking the first link in ( b ) so that the encounter moves into the lead creating a ` coherent back - scattering ' type of diagram .",
    "however the freedom of how much of the encounter box overlaps with the lead provides a further factor of the encounter time . in calculating the semiclassical contribution ,",
    "the integrand then becomes at least linear in @xmath143 and the integral vanishes in the semiclassical limit .",
    "in general our attention may simply be restricted to diagrams with at most one end point in each encounter @xcite .      for higher - order corrections one considers trajectories with arbitrarily many self - encounters .",
    "these self - encounters can involve two or more stretches of a trajectory that are almost parallel or anti - parallel , where the latter case requires trs .",
    "one speaks of an @xmath152-encounter if it involves @xmath152 stretches of a trajectory .",
    "the types of a trajectory s encounters are detailed in a vector @xmath153 whose @xmath152th component @xmath154 specifies the number of @xmath152-encounters .",
    "the total number of encounters is thus @xmath155 , and the total number of stretches in all encounter regions is @xmath156 .",
    "trajectories with self - encounters have close neighbouring trajectories that differ in the way in which the links are connected in the encounter regions . for a given vector @xmath153",
    "there are many different configurations in which the encounters and the reconnections can be arranged along a trajectory pair .",
    "the number of these _ structures _ or _ families _ is denoted by @xmath157 .",
    "the action difference of a trajectory pair can again be determined in terms of the separation of the trajectory stretches in the encounter regions . there are now altogether @xmath158 pairs of coordinates in the stable and unstable directions ( @xmath159 pairs for each @xmath152-encounter ) .",
    "these coordinates are combined into vectors @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and in the linearised approximation one has @xmath162 .",
    "the definition of the encounter duration is generalised to arbitrary @xmath152-encounters by requiring that the separations of the @xmath152 trajectory stretches remain smaller than some constant @xmath62 in the stable and unstable directions , @xmath163 where @xmath164 labels the encounters , @xmath165 .",
    "one applies again probabilistic arguments to replace the summation over trajectory pairs in by one over self - encounters , @xmath166 is the probability density that a trajectory of long duration @xmath120 has self - encounters that are specified by the vector @xmath153 and the separations @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "this density can be expressed by an integral over the first @xmath167 link durations @xmath168 at a final step , the sum rule is applied . as earlier in",
    ", it requires replacing the time in the exponent by the exposure time counting all encounter times only once . after replacing the integral over the trajectory time @xmath120 by an integral over the final link duration , one obtains @xmath169 in the integrals over the @xmath160 and @xmath161 coordinates the only terms that survive the semiclassical limit are those where all the encounter times in the denominator are exactly cancelled by corresponding encounter times in the numerator .",
    "the leading contribution thus again arises from the linear terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath170 . using @xmath171 , the final result reads @xmath172 as in the transport problem @xcite , one can identify simple diagrammatic rules from this result .",
    "each link contributes by a factor @xmath48 , and each encounter contributes a factor @xmath173 .",

    "note further that the sum over the channels gives a factor of @xmath4 that cancels the prefactor @xmath48 in .    as we have seen in section [ sec : leading off ] , there are additional trajectory correlations for the new semiclassical representation of the wigner time delay due to the one - leg loops that do not occur in the transport problem .",
    "in fact , for every trajectory configuration or _ structure _ in the above calculation there is a corresponding configuration where the end point is now inside the last encounter .",
    "the semiclassical calculation can be easily modified to obtain these additional contributions .",

    "these modifications lead to @xmath174 as expected all off - diagonal terms cancel .",

    "the set @xmath192 follows the set @xmath191 very closely along the links , but differs in the way those are connected in the encounter regions .",
    "one can then replace the double sum over @xmath191 and @xmath192 by a single sum over @xmath191 plus an integral over a probability density for the self - encounters .",

    ", we discuss the leading order contribution to the second moment @xmath195 . in analogy to transport problems we denote the @xmath196th end point by @xmath197 instead of @xmath184 .",
    "the simplest trajectory configuration with an encounter is the one that is schematically shown in ( a ) .",
    "the two trajectories belonging to @xmath191 are shown by the full lines and go from channel @xmath188 to end point @xmath198 and from @xmath199 to @xmath200 , respectively .",

    "the neighbouring trajectories belonging to @xmath192 ( dashed lines ) go from @xmath188 to @xmath200 and from @xmath199 to @xmath198 , respectively . according to the above rules we obtain the following contribution of this configuration to @xmath195 @xmath201 this contains @xmath173 from the encounter , @xmath202 from the incoming channels , @xmath203 from the links , and the overall factor @xmath204 .",

    "there is the further possibility that one of the end points is in the encounter as in figures  [ fig : secondmoments](b ) and ( c ) , which again contribute at the same order .",
    "all in all the result is @xmath205 this is indeed the leading order term of @xmath195 in systems with or without trs .    . in ( a )",
    "the incoming channels coincide , and ( b ) and ( c ) have one end point in the encounter .",

    "there is even simpler and alternative point of view in which one considers all the contributions in to come from ( a ) .",
    "the diagrams in figures  [ fig : secondmoments](a)-(c ) are considered to be limiting cases of ( a ) where either the encounter moves into the incoming lead or one of the end points moves into the encounter .",
    "these limiting cases can be included by changing the contribution of the encounter .    for the description we adopt the language from transport and call the initial points of @xmath191 @xmath50-leaves and the final points @xmath51-leaves .",
    "for the calculation of the moments @xmath206 we then have to take into account the following cases :    * encounters of size @xmath152 can move into the incoming lead when connected directly to @xmath152 @xmath50-leaves . *",
    "the @xmath51-leaves can be moved into the encounter they are connected to , but each encounter can only take one at a time .    in terms of the semiclassical contributions ,",

    "the contribution of encounter @xmath164 is hence changed to @xmath208 with @xmath209 being 1 when the encounter can move into the lead ( and 0 otherwise ) and @xmath210 the number of @xmath51-leaves attached .    in our example , if we change the encounter contribution for ( a ) in from @xmath173 to @xmath211 then we obtain the same result as in .",
    "one can also easily see that the off - diagonal contributions for the average time delay all vanish , because the last encounter must have @xmath212 ( @xmath152 is at least 2 and there is only 1 @xmath50-leaf ) and @xmath213 since it is connected to the outgoing channel .",
    "the product of contributions is then 0",

    "previous approaches to the time delay involved including an energy dependence so that calculating the semiclassical contribution of any diagram required knowledge of its complete structure . here",
    "instead the semiclassical contributions are much closer to standard transport moments where only the difference in the number of links and encounters matters .",
    "the only additional complication is that now some information about the position of the @xmath51-leaves is necessary .",
    "determining this is however much less demanding than treating full energy dependence .",

    "these diagrams involve a direct link between an incoming channel and an end point , while the other trajectory pair can be any arbitrary conductance ( first moment ) diagram .",

    "we may add a 2-encounter to an arbitrary @xmath224-quadruplet ( ) .",
    "alternatively for any @xmath224-quadruplet , we may join the link before an end point into the last encounter before the other end point ( ) .",
    "we may also join the final distinct encounters of any @xmath246-quadruplet by pulling out a 2-encounter to create a @xmath261-quadruplet .",
    "accounting for the minus sign from each encounter and the change in @xmath167 and @xmath69 we arrive at the relation @xmath264 since @xmath265 .",
    "another way to look at this is the following : one can describe an @xmath152-encounter as a cyclic permutation @xmath266 where the @xmath267 are labels corresponding to the order encounter stretches are visited in the entire diagram @xcite . if stretches @xmath268 and @xmath267 are connected to the outgoing channel , then adding a 2-encounter and shrinking the intervening links corresponds to multiplying ( on the left ) by @xmath269 .",
    "this breaks the @xmath152-cycle into a @xmath270 and @xmath271 cycle .",
    "if @xmath270 or @xmath271 are 1 then a link is separated from the encounter ( leaving only a link if @xmath260 ) otherwise the encounter breaks into two .",
    "-quadruplet leave from the same 3-encounter to which we append a new 2-encounter in ( a ) . shrinking both intervening links we pass through ( b ) to end up at ( c ) .",
    "the link ending in the end point @xmath198 is now no longer involved in the encounter and can be unwound to create the @xmath224-quadruplet in ( d ) or ( a ) . reversing the process , we may merge either of the final two links of any @xmath224-quadruplet into the last @xmath152-encounter connected to the other end point and create @xmath261-quadruplet ending in a larger @xmath272-encounter . ]",
    "we can repeat the same process of adding a 2-encounter and shrinking the adjoining links but starting with an @xmath245-quadruplet .",
    "this again leads to three cases of @xmath223-quadruplets with a lower value of @xmath158 : one with a 2-encounter removed , one with an @xmath262 encounter reduced by 1 and one where the @xmath152 encounter breaks into two separate ones . reversing the steps , for any @xmath273-quadruplet we can connect the two distinct encounters before the two end points by pulling out an 2-encounter ( which we then remove ) to give a contribution of @xmath274 to @xmath252 .",
    "the minus sign derives from the final diagram having one encounter less .",
    "then , for any @xmath223-quadruplet where @xmath200 is connected to an encounter , we can join the link to @xmath198 into the encounter giving a contribution of @xmath275 .",
    "here we remove the cases where @xmath200 connects directly to @xmath199 .",
    "swapping the roles of @xmath200 and @xmath198 gives a factor of 2 .",
    "finally we may connect the final links of any @xmath223-quadruplet with a 2-encounter creating an @xmath245-quadruplet with an additional encounter ( and 2 extra links ) and hence a contribution of @xmath276 to @xmath252 .",

    "this is only possible if both incoming channels are connected to the same 2-encounter .",
    "if , for example , an @xmath245-quadruplet starts with such a 2-encounter , then this encounter can be cut out ( by moving the incoming channels to after the encounter ) leaving a @xmath261-quadruplet with a value of @xmath158 which is one smaller .",
    "[ the only exception is ( a ) where the removal of the 2-encounter leads to the @xmath223-quadruplet in ( b ) ] . reversing the process ,",
    "all such @xmath245-quadruplets can be built by adding a 2-encounter to the front of any @xmath261-quadruplet [ or ( b ) ] .",

    "we have @xmath234 links , @xmath69 encounters and a factor of @xmath4 for each channel .",
    "both end points can also be moved into the last encounter , and one encounter can possibly be moved into an incoming lead , giving a combined contribution of @xmath286 where @xmath287 if an encounter can move into a lead , and @xmath193 otherwise .",

    "compared to the calculation for the moment @xmath195 in the previous section , the role of the @xmath245- and @xmath261-quadruplets are simply reversed , the case @xmath278 does not contribute , and due to the normalisation of the variance we do nt have to multiply by @xmath296 .",
    "the variance of the wigner time delay is therefore given by the sum @xmath297 this result fully agrees with rmt , as can be seen by setting @xmath31 in .",

    "this is notably simpler than the results for the standard transport second moments ( _ e.g. _  shot noise and the conductance variance ) @xcite .",
    "treating the case with trs requires , however , a more involved calculation which we pursue in the appendices .",
    "first , we map the problem without trs to periodic orbits in [ app : unitrelation ] and then evaluate the semiclassical sums which arise in [ app : unitsums ] . the corresponding sums for systems invariant under time - reversal",

    "we find identical results to rmt for the variance of the wigner time delay and the second moment of the proper time - delays , and derive a new result for the variance of the diagonal elements ( which in the case of orthogonal symmetry is not the same as the variance of the partial time - delays ) .",
    "we also demonstrate the equivalence of the semiclassical approach for the time - delay problem developed here to previous treatments in [ app : comparison ] .",
    "we now apply the diagrammatic rules established in to derive an expansion in inverse channel number of the moment generating function of proper time - delays , @xmath302 as shown in @xcite , and further developed in @xcite , the contribution of leading order in @xmath59 comes from diagrams that can be represented as rooted plane trees and which can therefore be constructed recursively . for example , the diagram in ( a ) can be redrawn as the boundary walk around the tree in ( a ) .",
    "-leaves it may move into the incoming lead leaving the diagram in ( b ) which corresponds to ( a ) . alternatively either outgoing channel can move into the encounter as in ( c ) which are a new representation of the diagrams in figures  [ fig : secondmoments](b ) and ( c ) . ]",
    "rooted trees can of course be considered as unrooted trees , which we will call subtrees below , appended to a single point .",
    "going beyond the leading order amounts instead to adding subtrees to increasingly intricate _ base structures _ , following the formalism of @xcite . leaving the details of the diagrammatic approach to @xcite",
    ", we highlight below how it can be adapted to the semiclassical method presented here .",
    "starting with unrooted trees , there are two types : one with an excess of outgoing leaves whose generating function we call @xmath303 and one with a excess of incoming leaves counted in @xmath304 . for example , removing the top @xmath188 channel from the tree in ( a ) to obtain an unrooted tree , an excess of @xmath51-leaves remains forming a subtree included in @xmath303 .",
    "the generating variable will be @xmath305 whose power counts the number of leaves , which is related to the order of the moment .",
    "breaking the trees at the top encounter node gives the recursion @xmath306 where the first term is an empty tree going straight to an outgoing leaf , the next term are trees with encounter nodes of size @xmath152 with @xmath307 and the last term is the correction for allowing one outgoing leaf to move into the encounter ( and replacing the corresponding general tree @xmath303 ) where we have the factor of @xmath305 to account for the lost leaf . summing we get @xmath308 with @xmath309 .",
    "this also gives us the useful relation @xmath310    the trees of type @xmath304 with an excess of incoming leaves can actually also move into the incoming lead if all the @xmath304 type trees after the top encounter end directly in an incoming channel .",
    "then we have the recursion @xmath311 where the first three terms again correspond to an empty tree , trees with top encounter of size @xmath152 and moving outgoing leaves into the encounter while the last term is the new possibility of moving the encounter into the incoming lead .",
    "summing gives @xmath312 substituting for @xmath305 from in just the first term on the right gives the simplification @xmath313 from which we can get a quadratic for @xmath303 , @xmath304 and more importantly @xmath314 @xmath315 with @xmath316 .      to get the full leading order moments with generating function @xmath317",
    ", we need to root our trees by adding an incoming channel to the @xmath303 trees ( and divide by @xmath4 ) or adding an outgoing leaf to the @xmath304 trees at the top .",
    "the first option then allows the trees to also move into the incoming lead to give @xmath318 using this is just @xmath319 alternatively , and more simply , we can place an outgoing leaf on top of the @xmath304 type trees @xmath320 where the sum is over the additional possibility of placing the new outgoing leaf into the encounter .",

    "this is exactly what was in @xcite and equivalent to the previous rmt result @xcite .",
    "compared to the energy dependent cubic equations of @xcite with corresponding energy derivatives and identity matrix corrections , the result can now be obtained much more simply and directly with our new semiclassical approach for the proper time - delays .",
    "moving to the subleading order , we can continue looking for the dominant diagrams .",
    "the non - vanishing contribution exists only for systems with trs , whereas for those without trs the first correction occurs in the second subleading order ( see below ) . as shown in @xcite , the relevant diagram in the former case has the topology of a mbius strip that arises after merging the quadruplets with time - reversal partners . around the mbius strip",
    "there are two types of nodes , those with an even number of subtrees on each side and those with an odd number .",
    "we shall denote these as an even node and odd node respectively .",
    "for an @xmath152 encounter there are @xmath207 subtrees of each type ( 2 stretches are the mbius loop itself ) which can be arranged in @xmath152 ways with an even number on each side and @xmath207 ways with an odd number on each side .",
    "these nodes can not move into the incoming lead , but directly connecting odd leaves can be moved into the encounter node ( one at a time ) . using slightly different notation than @xcite which is more useful for the higher orders in and [ app : algorithmic ] ,",
    "the contribution of an even node is @xmath322 while an odd node contributes @xmath323 both include the link leading up to the encounter node ( but not the one leaving as this is included in the next node ) .    around the mbius loop",
    "we have an arbitrary number of encounter nodes , but we need to divide by their number because of the rotational symmetry . as such",
    "we define a generating function of an arbitrary arrangement of nodes around a loop @xmath324 where we divide by 2 to account for the inside / outside symmetry of the loop .",
    "a factor @xmath35 is included with the odd nodes since we actually need to have an odd number of odd nodes to close the loop properly .",
    "this is then achieved by comparing the values of @xmath325 at @xmath326 , giving @xmath327 which is the integrated moment generating function .",
    "for the generating function itself , we differentiate @xmath328 so that by using the solution for @xmath314 from we get the result @xmath329 which is the same as in @xcite but obtained in much more straightforward way , without needing to add and then remove an energy dependence .",
    "to treat higher - order corrections , we can use the algorithmic approach of @xcite which makes use of combinatorial base structures built on permutations describing the diagram s edges and vertices .",
    "the possible permutations are generated via a computer search , while the permissible edge and vertex components are matched up according to the prescription of the permutation .",
    "all that is then needed by the algorithm are the general semiclassical contribution of the possible edge and vertex components which we list in [ app : algorithmic ] .    here",
    "instead we merely state the results , which for unitary symmetry are @xmath330 confirming the guess in @xcite , and @xmath331 for the orthogonal case ( with trs ) , the results are @xmath332 again confirming the guess in @xcite , while at higher order we have @xmath333 and @xmath334 at the highest two orders for both symmetry classes , the generating functions are new results not yet calculated semiclassically @xcite or using rmt @xcite .",
    "an efficient method is developed for the semiclassical calculation of the statistics of time delays in chaotic cavities .",
    "the method relies on the resonant representation of the wigner - smith time - delay matrix that has the advantage of not involving an energy derivative .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of semiclassical trajectories that enter the system and terminate inside . under spectral",
    "averaging , the results for time - delay moments are then produced by sums over sets of classical trajectories which can be evaluated using simple diagrammatic rules . for _ individual systems _ we establish in this way the universality of the rmt predictions for the second moments , including the variance of the wigner time delay , at arbitrary number of open channels .",
    "we also significantly advance the computation of the moment generating function of the proper time - delays , for which the first five orders are found in .",
    "this has been achieved by incorporating the present approach into the algorithmic formalism of @xcite , leading to much simpler diagrammatic rules for the trees which arise .",
    "although previous semiclassical approaches involving energy correlations can be used to obtain the same results , the quadratic subtree equations become cubic , making the derivations and semiclassical contributions notably more involved . for the second moment of the proper time - delays and the variance of the wigner time delay , there are tricks to reduce the difficulty of the previous semiclassical treatment , as discussed in [ app : comparison ] .",
    "however , the results can only be obtained using the sums evaluated here in [ app : unitsums ] and [ app : orthosums ] while the variance of the diagonal elements of the time - delay matrix can not be treated .",
    "the new approach developed here presents a simpler and , more importantly , a unified approach to all the second moments .",
    "notably for the unitary case , the second time - delay moments can be calculated without any recursive sums , which is not even possible for their transport analogues .",
    "but the main advantage of our approach is that the diagrams and their contributions are now more similar to those of quantum transport problems , as developed in @xcite .",
    "transport moments are expressed in terms of the transmission eigenvalues that follow the jacobi ensemble of rmt @xcite .",
    "note that arbitrary transport moments can also be expressed in terms of recursively generated functions called weingarten coefficients .",
    "moreover , the corresponding semiclassical diagrams can be mapped to certain types of primitive factorisations @xcite which in turn match the weingarten coefficients so that semiclassics and the jacobi ensemble can be proven to be identical @xcite . the time - delay matrix ( in its ` symmetrised ' form @xcite )",
    "follows , however , an inverse wishart distribution and its eigenvalues form the laguerre ensemble @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the moments of inverse real wishart matrices , corresponding to time delays with trs , were recently expressed in terms of deformed weingarten coefficients @xcite . indeed ,",
    "appropriately substituting @xmath335 and @xmath336 into the example formulae in @xcite , one quickly obtains the second moments in , and with @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the new semiclassical approach , with its simplified diagrammatic rules , opens the door for a dynamical justification of the use of rmt and the laguerre ensemble in the time - delay problem .    to this end",
    ", we mention that another method was recently put forward by novaes @xcite who suggested to use a matrix model which generates the same diagrams as in semiclassics but can be calculated exactly in rmt . for systems with broken trs",
    ", the method was originally implemented to the transport problem , yielding successfully the exact rmt results for general counting statistics , and then further applied to time delays @xcite , producing the exact moments of proper time - delays up to 8th order semiclassically . however , showing the full equivalence for arbitrary moments was not yet possible , mainly due to the diagrammatic complexity induced by energy correlations .",
    "we believe that the incorporation of the semiclassical approach developed here into the formalism of @xcite is a promising way to go forward in establishing the full rmt - semiclassics equivalence .",
    "further developments include generalizations to the case of preserved trs as well as other symmetry classes , _",
    "e.g. _  andreev billiards for which the statistics of the time - delay matrix was recently derived in @xcite .    throughout this article , we have considered the universal regime described by rmt , which neglects the effects due to a finite ehrenfest time @xcite .",
    "the latter is responsible for system - specific corrections which can only be obtained semiclassically @xcite ; various applications to transport were already discussed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical representation developed here is already tailored for taking into account such effects in the time - delay problem , calling for further study in this direction .",
    "we also mention the challenge of generalising the approach to treat other ` real - world ' effects , _",
    "e.g. _  absorption @xcite and non - ideal coupling @xcite . + * acknowledgement * + support from the funding programme open access publishing from the german research foundation ( dfg ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
