    "semidetached binaries in which a compact object ( white dwarf , neutron star or black hole ) accretes material via roche lobe overflow from a companion on or near the main sequence are of great interest in current astrophysics .",
    "the evolution of such systems is driven by orbital angular momentum losses via gravitational radiation and magnetic braking ( see e.g. king 1988 for a review ) .",
    "thus most properties of the binary , particularly the mean mass transfer rate , depend essentially only on the secondary mass @xmath0 and change on the timescale @xmath1 yr for angular momentum loss . in a recent paper ( king , frank , kolb & ritter 1996a , henceforth paper i ) we discussed the conditions under which mass transfer can vary cyclically about the evolutionary mean in these systems by developing a general formalism allowing one to study the stability of mass transfer in systems driven by angular momentum losses .",
    "the existence of cycles is required to account for the wide dispersion of e.g. mass transfer rates at a given orbital period .",
    "we concluded that the most likely cause of such cycles is weak irradiation of the companion star by the accreting component .",
    "the conditions for this appear to be fulfilled in a large class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , in which the accreting star is a white dwarf .",
    "of course semidetached evolution is not restricted to systems with main  sequence companions . in systems with orbital periods @xmath2 day the orbital evolution and hence the rate of mass transfer is either determined or strongly influenced by nuclear evolution of the companion . in this paper",
    "we discuss the stability of mass transfer in systems containing a giant or a subgiant companion and consider the possibility of irradiation  driven mass transfer cycles similar to those thought to exist in cvs .",
    "for this purpose we generalize the analysis of paper i to include the effects of nuclear evolution on the radius variations by using a simple core  envelope model for the companion .",
    "this is a good representation of systems with low ",
    "mass giant secondaries , which constitute the great majority of long  period compact binaries .",
    "however this description does not apply to the recently  discovered black  hole transient gro j1655 - 40 , where the companion star appears to be crossing the hertzsprung gap ( orosz & bailyn , 1996 ) .",
    "in this section we follow closely the formalism developed in paper i , casting the equations governing time  dependent mass transfer in a semidetached binary in a form suitable for global analysis including the effects of nuclear evolution .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the effect of variations in the radius @xmath3 of the lobe  filling star on the transfer rate , as this is the simplest way of causing mass transfer variations ( other ways can easily be accomodated : paper i gives an example ) .",
    "note that this part of the analysis is quite general , in that there is no presumption at this point that the radius variations result from irradiation .",
    "radius changes can result from dynamical , thermal or secular processes .",
    "for example , local adjustments in the structure of the atmospheric layers can take place on the shortest ( dynamical ) timescale , while adjustments of the stellar radius in response to secular mass loss and nuclear evolution occur on the longest ( secular ) driving timescale @xmath4 defined more precisely below .",
    "we represent the radius variation as @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the adiabatic mass  radius exponent ( @xmath7 for a fully convective star ) , @xmath8 represents radius variations due to thermal relaxation and irradiation of the star by the primary , and @xmath9 represents the secular changes due to nuclear evolution .",
    "we considered examples of specific forms of @xmath10 in paper i and will discuss these again later .",
    "the change of the mass transfer rate is given by @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the critical roche radius , and @xmath13 is the pressure scale height in the secondary star s atmosphere .",
    "the approximation given by ( [ e2.2 ] ) is justified since even for giant companions @xmath14 .",
    "the response of the roche radius to mass loss is described by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a function of the mass ratio @xmath17 , approximately given by @xmath18 for conservative mass transfer , and @xmath19 is the rate of loss of orbital angular momentum . inserting ( [ e2.1 ] ) and ( [ e2.3 ] ) into ( [ e2.2 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath20\\ ; . \\label{e2.4}\\ ] ]    for the more general case considered here the evolution of the binary is driven by the combined effects of nuclear evolution and angular momentum losses .",
    "we introduce the effective driving timescale @xmath4 , as follows ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the nuclear timescale , and @xmath23 is the timescale for angular momentum losses .",
    "the nuclear timescale is a strong function of the core mass , and is @xmath24 yr for giants and much longer for low mass main sequence dwarfs . the angular momentum loss time scale @xmath25 is typically @xmath26 yr for main sequence companions , but could be much longer for evolved companions .",
    "thus orbital evolution is driven mainly by angular momentum losses in systems with main sequence companions ( e.g. cvs ) and nuclear processes in systems with evolved companions .",
    "the introduction of @xmath4 allows us to treat both cases simultaneously .",
    "we define a dimensionless mass transfer rate    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the adiabatic mass transfer rate i.e. the steady rate implied by equation ( [ e2.4 ] ) with @xmath29 .",
    "a system undergoing stable mass transfer will typically do so at @xmath30 ( see sect .",
    "we also introduce the dimensionless stellar radius    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the radius of the secondary in thermal equilibrium for a given total mass @xmath0 and a core mass @xmath33 .",
    "the radii and luminosities of lower giant  branch stars are virtually independent of the mass of the envelope but depend strongly on the mass of the degenerate helium core ( refsdal & weigert 1970 ) .",
    "we allow @xmath34 formally to depend on the total mass because then the equations obtained are identical in form to those derived in paper i and have wider applicability .    as we discuss in sect .",
    "3 , the secular equilibrium radius of the companion under stable mass transfer differs slightly from @xmath34 . although the equilibrium radius @xmath34 is only attained in the absence of mass transfer , we write formally    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is defined by the above equation . taking the time derivative of equation ( [ e2.6 ] ) , and neglecting secular variations of @xmath13",
    ", we obtain    @xmath37}\\over { \\rm d}t}\\ ; . \\label{e2.9}\\ ] ]    finally , we introduce @xmath38 , which is typically @xmath39 for lower giant branch stars ( see below ) .",
    "we define the dimensionless thermal relaxation function @xmath40 , and the dimensionless time @xmath41",
    ". with these assumptions and definitions ( [ e2.9 ] ) becomes    @xmath42 + \\epsilon x\\biggl[{x\\over ( \\zs-\\zr ) }   + t_{\\rm dr } { \\dd\\ln{[(\\zs-\\zr)t_{\\rm dr}]}\\over\\dd t}\\biggr]\\ ; .",
    "\\label{e2.10}\\ ] ]    note that since the terms inside the second set of square brackets are of order unity and are multiplied by @xmath43 , they can be safely neglected .",
    "thus ( [ e2.10 ] ) reduces to    @xmath42\\ ; . \\label{e2.11}\\ ] ]    with the variations of the equilibrium radius given by equation ( [ e2.8 ] ) , and using the above conventions , the radius equation ( [ e2.1 ] ) becomes    @xmath44\\ ; , \\label{e2.12}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 .",
    "the equations ( [ e2.11 ] , [ e2.12 ] ) describing radius and mass transfer variations are identical in form to those derived in paper i. thus we can take over from paper i all the results for the phase plane motion of the system , the critical curves @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the fixed point(s ) @xmath48 at the intersection(s ) of these critical curves , the stability anaylsis for the fixed point(s ) , and the conditions for limit cycles , with the modification that now @xmath4 is a more general driving time which includes both systemic angular momentum losses and nuclear evolution . in the limit @xmath49",
    "we recover the case studied in paper i.    from equations ( [ e2.11 ] , [ e2.12 ] ) it is easy to see that the stationary ( secular mean ) mass transfer rate at the fixed point @xmath50 depends on the properties of the companion and the driving rate .",
    "in particular it is independent of @xmath51 ( as it must be ) ; and in most realistic cases @xmath52 .",
    "the radius @xmath53 at the fixed point on the other hand is given implicitly in terms of @xmath51 ; again we typically have @xmath54 ( see paper i for further details ) .",
    "in their study of the evolution of compact binaries containing a lower giant branch companion , webbink , rappaport and savonije ( 1983 ) introduced simple analytic expressions for the luminosity and radius in terms of the core mass . for our purposes",
    "it suffices to take only the first two terms of their approximate formulae for the radius    @xmath55    and the luminosity @xmath56 in thermal equilibrium . using these equations we can readily estimate @xmath43 for these stars @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean molecular weight in the stellar atmosphere . from ( [ e3.1 ] , [ e3.2 ] ) the nuclear timescale for radial variations is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is calculated from the equilibrium luminosity assuming a hydrogen mass fraction of 0.7 and an energy yield of @xmath61 erg g@xmath62 .",
    "thus @xmath63 the kelvin - helmholtz timescale is defined for the whole star as @xmath64 so @xmath65 the ratio of these timescales plays a major role in the discussion of thermal relaxation and stability .",
    "we define @xmath66    since no explicit dependence of @xmath34 on the total mass of the companion @xmath0 is allowed in equations ( [ e3.1 ] , [ e3.2 ] ) , it appears that @xmath67 .",
    "however , both computed models of lower giant branch stars and analytic treatment of nearly fully convective stars following the approximations used by kippenhahn and weigert ( 1990 ) for the hayashi line show a weak dependence on the total stellar mass @xmath0 . taking a photospheric opacity of the form @xmath68 , and adopting a polytropic index @xmath69 for the envelope",
    ", one can show that @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , the above expression yields @xmath73 , while direct estimates from numerical stellar models indicate @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "we adopt the latter range in describing the reaction of the star to mass loss , although the relation ( [ e3.1 ] ) is adequate for computing the nuclear and thermal timescales .",
    "we now describe the effects of thermal relaxation and irradiation on the radius of the evolved companion .",
    "we do this here using a simple homologous model and making the same approximations as in king et al .",
    "1995 and in paper i with slight changes appropriate for giants :    \\1 ) homology relations can be used to describe the stellar structure , i.e.the effective temperature @xmath76 on the unirradiated portion of the stellar surface remains essentially constant ( hayashi line ) and any stellar radius change changes the surface luminosity as @xmath77 . in constrast @xmath78 remains unchanged , as given by equation ( [ e3.2 ] ) .",
    "\\2 ) if a fraction @xmath79 of the stellar surface is exposed to a uniform irradiating flux @xmath80 , the luminosity of the star , i.e.  the loss of energy per unit time from the interior , is reduced by the blocking luminosity @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the unperturbed stellar flux and @xmath83 a parameter which is adjusted to approximate the results of more realistic model calculations [ e.g.  those by ritter et al .",

    "the ratio @xmath93 , with @xmath94 being the thermal timescale for the convective envelope , is a constant which depends on the internal structure ( i.e. mainly on the ratio of envelope mass to the total mass of the secondary ) , and @xmath95 this is the dimensionless critical mass transfer rate which yields an irradiating flux @xmath96 . cycles typically occur provided that @xmath97 is @xmath98 the secular mean transfer rate @xmath99 . in ( [ e3.6 ] ) @xmath100 is the orbital separation and @xmath101 a dimensionless efficiency factor relating the irradiating flux @xmath80 to the mass transfer rate via @xmath102    the critical mass transfer rate for cvs is @xmath103 , where the value of @xmath83 depends on the type of companion star assumed , while @xmath101 depends mainly on the radiation spectrum ( typical values are @xmath104 , with @xmath105 a few percent ) . as this critical rate",
    "is of order the secular mean mass transfer rate @xmath106 , irradiation can potentially drive cycles in cvs , as we found in paper i. for lmxbs with similar mass ratios , the much smaller neutron star or effective black  hole radius implies @xmath107 .",
    "thus we can potentially expect cycles in these systems also .",
    "this contrasts with the case of lmxbs with unevolved companions ( cf paper i ) , where the companion is too strongly irradiated to give cycles ( critical transfer rates @xmath108 ) .",
    "for lmxbs with evolved companions the large ratio @xmath109 of driving to thermal timescales almost compensates the effect of the smaller primary radius to give @xmath110 .",
    "the simple thermal relaxation function given in the previous section allows us to discuss the stability of mass transfer in close binaries with evolved companions .",
    "more detailed calculations using the bipolytrope approximation ( ritter , zhang & kolb 1996b ) or integrating the full equations of stellar structure with appropriate changes in the boundary conditions ( hameury & ritter 1996 ) produce results which to a first approximation can be represented by this analytic form with suitable @xmath111 . in paper",
    "i we noted that a necessary condition for limit cycles is that the fixed point is unstable , which in turn requires @xmath112 and @xmath113 simultaneously .",
    "these derivatives are easily calculable for the simple form of equation ( [ e3.5 ] ) , namely @xmath114 \\,3 r_0 ^ 2 - 1 \\right\\ } \\ ; ,   \\label{e4.1}\\ ] ] and @xmath115 for physically reasonable situations @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and thus clearly @xmath112 as required .",
    "the second condition @xmath118 for instability can be rewritten as in paper i : @xmath119 where the l.h.s .",
    "is a function which has a maximum value of @xmath120 at @xmath121 and vanishes at both small and large @xmath122 .",
    "as emphasised in paper i the r.h.s . of equation ( [ e4.3 ] )",
    "depends mainly on the type of companion and the driving mechanism .",
    "clearly the large values of @xmath109 for giant or subgiant companions makes these systems extremely vulnerable to the irradiation instability .",
    "note that if @xmath123 in ( [ e4.3 ] ) , i.e. irradiation is not included , or the flux is somehow blocked ( e.g. by a thick disk ) , the inequality is violated and mass transfer driven by nuclear evolution is stable as assumed in conventional treatments of these systems .",
    "thus the simple model described above suggests that most binaries with irradiated lower giant branch ",
    "companions can not transfer mass at a stable rate .",
    "more detailed models discussed later confirm this result . while the linearized equations are adequate to discuss the stability of the fixed point , as in paper i , we need the full non - linear evolution equations to understand the ultimate fate of the system .",
    "it turns out that the phase point representing the evolution of the system away from an unstable fixed point is trapped in its vicinity , and will settle into a limit cycle which is described in more detail below .",
    "the simple thermal relaxation functions @xmath51 given by ( [ e3.5 ] ) for evolved companions and equation ( 38 ) of paper i for main sequence companions yield approximate analytic expressions for a number of properties of the limit cycle .",
    "the two cases can be treated simultaneously by taking @xmath90 \\ , r^3 - r^{-(\\nu+2 ) } \\right\\ } \\ ; ,   \\label{e5.1}\\ ] ] with @xmath109 as defined in this paper , and @xmath124 or @xmath125 for main sequence and giant companions respectively .",
    "some of the results given below depend on having @xmath126 , which is satisfied very well by giants [ for which @xmath127 , see ( [ e3.2.4 ] ) ] but not always by main  sequence companions .",
    "nevertheless , since most of the analytic results described below can also be obtained for main  sequence companions , we shall quote them here too .    from ( [ e2.11 ] ) the critical curve @xmath128 is given by @xmath129 .",
    "the chosen form of @xmath51 gives two branches of this curve with different slopes : a low branch with @xmath130 and a high branch where @xmath131 .",
    "for the low branch one can easily show using the approximation @xmath132 that @xmath133 the denominator in the above equation can be rewritten using ( [ e4.2 ] ) as @xmath134 .",
    "the condition @xmath113 for instability ensures that this denominator is positive near @xmath99 ; as @xmath135 must be finite the denominator must remain positive everywhere on the lower branch , implying a positive slope there . since in general the radial variations are small departures from equilibrium , we can linearize around @xmath136 to get @xmath137 at @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "in general the slope of this critical curve is given by @xmath139 where @xmath112 for physically relevant cases . if @xmath140 , as in the case of evolved companions , then the slope of the lower branch at @xmath141 is approximately @xmath142 .",
    "the upper branch is obtained by setting the tanh factor to unity and thus @xmath143 for small departures from the equilibrium radius this reduces to @xmath144 showing that the upper branch has a large negative slope and is therefore stable ( as @xmath145 we have @xmath146 , which is @xmath147 even for giant companions with @xmath125 ) . at some intermediate value of the transfer rate @xmath148",
    "there is a turning point at which @xmath149 , or equivalently where @xmath150 .",
    "this turning point therefore satisfies the equation @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the dimensionless radius at the turning point . in general @xmath152 and @xmath148",
    "must be obtained by solving equation ( [ e5.4 ] ) together with @xmath153 , which can be easily done iteratively .",
    "note also that as in paper i , the axis @xmath141 is formally part of the @xmath128 curve , although it takes infinite time to reduce @xmath154 to zero ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . from the considerations above we can see that the fixed point is unstable when @xmath155 .",
    "the maximum expansion stage of the secondary is reached close to @xmath152 .",
    "we could estimate @xmath152 by asking for the radius at which @xmath156 , but we prefer to use a physical argument based on the assumptions made in the model : the maximum expansion of the companion is reached when all the luminosity generated is emitted by the unilluminated side at the unperturbed effective temperature .",
    "this yields @xmath157 and @xmath158 where @xmath159 .",
    "formally if @xmath160 for non  vanishing illumination we again get the adiabatic mass transfer rate @xmath161 and thus @xmath128 .",
    "this simple argument shows that main sequence companions expand relatively little under illumination while giants expand substantially : in general we have @xmath162 for these two type of companion .",
    "thus with @xmath163 we find from ( [ e5.5 ] ) maximum radii @xmath164 for main  sequence and ( sub)giant companions respectively ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "physically this happens because upon expansion the nuclear luminosity of a main  sequence star decreases , whereas the luminosity generated by a giant does not depend on the radius . thus assuming that the stars remain on the hayashi line , a giant must expand until the unblocked area equals its original surface area , while a main sequence star finds a new irradiated equilibrium by expanding and simultaneously reducing its nuclear luminosity .",
    "since @xmath166 , the radius ( [ e5.5 ] ) ( @xmath167 ) has @xmath168 with @xmath169 , while the radius at which @xmath170 and @xmath135 are equal differs from this only by terms @xmath171^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we can then show from equation ( [ e5.4 ] ) that @xmath148 is never very large , typically @xmath172 a few times the adiabatic rate .",
    "we can also make some general statements about the properties of the other critical curve @xmath173 .",
    "all physically plausible @xmath51 must be such that under no mass transfer and no illumination , the star remains at its equilibrium radius , implying @xmath174 .",
    "therefore from equation ( [ e2.12 ] ) one sees that the critical curve @xmath173 must go through the point @xmath175 .",
    "the slope of this curve at that point is also positive , but smaller than the slope of the @xmath128 curve at slightly larger @xmath176 if a fixed point with @xmath177 exists .",
    "this is obvious from geometrical arguments , but can also be shown explicitly .    a typical limit cycle is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where we have stretched the @xmath176 variable and exaggerated the separation between the two critical curves for the sake of clarity . given that the @xmath173 curve intersects the @xmath176-axis at @xmath136 , the entire cycle satisfies @xmath178 , i.e. the star is always somewhat oversized .",
    "the critical curves cross at the unstable fixed point @xmath48 .",
    "the four points labelled abcd along the cycle identify the locations at which the phase point crosses critical curves .",
    "these naturally divide the cycle into four phases which we discuss in turn . at point",
    "a the mass transfer reaches its peak value @xmath179 and we have maximum contact : @xmath180 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath181 from the fact that a lies almost vertically above the point where @xmath137 . from ( [ e5.2 ] ,",
    "[ e5.3 ] ) we have @xmath182 . in physical units",
    "this rate is @xmath183 where @xmath94 is the timescale for thermal relaxation of the convective envelope , which can be significantly shorter than @xmath184 . at point",
    "b the companion is very close to its maximum size , while the binary orbit has expanded so that @xmath185 .",
    "the degree of overfilling of the roche lobe has been reduced to @xmath186 .",
    "the stellar expansion rate @xmath187 is now too slow compared with that of the lobe to sustain the high mass transfer rate which in turn drives the radius expansion .",
    "( this is inevitable since the transfer rate can not indefinitely remain above the secular mean driven by nuclear expansion and angular momentum losses . )",
    "thus the companion rapidly loses contact and the mass transfer drops very sharply , while the star shrinks back towards its equilibrium radius . at point",
    "c minimum mass transfer is reached because the system is maximally detached , with @xmath188 , so that @xmath154 is essentially zero in the low state . at this point",
    "@xmath189 is again very close to zero , and nothing will happen until combined effects of nuclear evolution and angular momentum losses bring the system close to contact again . at d",
    "the secondary is expanding slightly ( @xmath190 ) so that @xmath173 .",
    "the companion radius @xmath3 is now within a few scale heights of @xmath191 .",
    "this raises the transfer rate , making the companion expand more rapidly under irradiation , which in turn increases the transfer rate , so that the cycle restarts .",
    "we can also estimate the timescales for the different phases of the cycle and evaluate the total mass transferred in a cycle .",
    "we estimate the rise time by assuming that the mass transfer initially increases because the thermal imbalance due to irradiation forces the secondary into deeper contact . the characteristic rate of radial expansion when a fraction @xmath79 is fully blocked is @xmath192 .",
    "therefore the rise time is approximately the time required to expand by @xmath193 scale heights @xmath194 where we have used our estimate of @xmath195 to obtain the final expression . during the time @xmath196 spent on the high branch , the rate of expansion of the secondary decreases monotonically from the maximum rate estimated above , which yields the peak mass transfer rate @xmath181 , until @xmath197 . at that point ( b )",
    "we have @xmath173 and the expansion rate falls below the driving rate so that the system detaches , going rapidly into a low state .",
    "we adopt the following ansatz for the radius as a function of time @xmath198 equating @xmath199 and @xmath200 , we obtain both the characteristic radial expansion timescale @xmath201 and the time @xmath196 spent on the high branch @xmath202 and @xmath203 where we have taken @xmath204 and @xmath205 . as soon as the system detaches , irradiation ceases , and the companion contracts rapidly while the orbit and roche lobe remain at the size attained at the end of the high state .",
    "the contraction is even more rapid than the expansion because the star is more luminous .",
    "one can show that the characteristic thermal contraction time scale is @xmath206 leading to @xmath207 clearly this effect is more pronounced in giant companions than in main  sequence secondaries , for reasons that have already been mentioned . in a few times @xmath208 ( i.e. typically a time @xmath209 ) the mass transfer formally reaches a minimum value @xmath210 and a long detached ( low ) state now follows while the driving tries to bring the system back to contact .",
    "the time spent in the low state is thus dominated by the time @xmath211",
    "@xmath212    the total mass transferred during a cycle can now be estimated as @xmath213 , which yields the simple  with hindsight perhaps obvious  result @xmath214 hence the total cycle time @xmath215 is @xmath216 thus irradiated main  sequence stars ( @xmath217 ) transfer at most a few percent of their mass per cycle .",
    "in contrast giants ( @xmath218 ) transfer a significant fraction @xmath219 of their total mass @xmath0 in the high state , which may amount to most of the convective envelope . since @xmath94 is also much shorter for giants we expect that if the irradiation instability is allowed to grow unchecked in such systems it will produce accretion rates which are super  eddington in lmxbs .",
    "the resulting common ",
    "envelope evolution would probably lead to the formation of an ultrashort  period binary .",
    "clearly the irradiation instability must be quenched in observed lmxbs with evolved companions . in section 7 we discuss ways in which this can happen . for reference",
    "we collect together the analytic expressions for the various properties of the limit cycle in table 1 .",
    "we have integrated the evolution equations ( [ e2.11 ] , [ e2.12 ] ) from arbitrary initial states for a variety of parameter choices . in this section",
    "we present a few examples and compare them with the analytic estimates given in the previous section .",
    "the values quoted in the text are those obtained by numerical integration , with the corresponding analytic estimate in brackets .",
    "the analytic estimates for peak rates , rise times , and maximum expansion radius are in all cases calculated in very good agreement with numerical results . in general we integrated the equations for several cycles ( 3 - 6 ) and noted that the first outburst is usually somewhat untypical ( slightly higher for the same radii and a higher peak rate ) because of initial conditions , whereas later outbursts are virtually identical .",
    "we therefore quote values taken from later outbursts .",
    "2 shows a case with core mass @xmath220 , the lowest reasonable value for which the approximations used in section 3 are still valid .",
    "we have also taken @xmath221 , which is perhaps unrealistically large unless there is significant scattering from a disc corona or similar structure .",
    "the luminosity and radius of the companion are at the lower end of the subgiant range and therefore the instability is weakest",
    ". nevertheless a very large amplitude outburst results , with a peak transfer rate @xmath222 ( 154.9 ) which is attained rapidly , in @xmath223 ( 0.033 ) .",
    "the companion continues to expand in the high state until the turning point is reached at @xmath224 ( 1.41421 ) .",
    "the duration of the high state can be read off the graph directly and is @xmath225 ( 12.5 ) . while the behaviour of @xmath176 as shown in fig .",
    "2 appears to obey equation ( [ e5.9 ] ) , closer examination shows that the expansion phase is actually faster than exponential while the contraction phase is slower than the assumed exponential .",
    "nevertheless we have estimated the characteristic radial expansion and contraction timescales graphically obtaining @xmath226 ( 2.67 ) and @xmath227 ( 0.95 ) . despite the fact that equation ( [ e5.9 ] ) holds only approximately , the expressions based on it are better than order of magnitude estimates .",
    "for the case shown , the total duration of the cycle is 415.9 and the duration of the low state is @xmath228 ( 414.2 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows another case with a higher core mass @xmath229 and @xmath230 , appropriate for illumination by a point source .",
    "the instability in this case is more violent , with shorter rise times @xmath231 ( 0.0024 ) and higher peak rates @xmath232 ( 3609 ) , but a smaller turning radius @xmath233 ( 1.19523 ) .",
    "the total duration @xmath234 ( 0.43 ) of the high state is relatively short .",
    "the characteristic e - folding times for radial expansion @xmath235 ( 0.054 ) and contraction @xmath236 ( 0.031 ) are also relatively shorter because of the higher luminosity .",
    "the analytic estimates for the properties of the radial variations during the limit cycle are even more accurate than in the case in fig.2 , because the neglected terms @xmath237 are still smaller here .",
    "the total duration of the cycle is 188.6 and the low state lasts for @xmath238 ( 195.2 ) .",
    "we can now discuss the application of the theory developed here to various types of close binary encountered in nature .",
    "the only restriction is that the companions must have a significant convective envelope and thus a low mass @xmath239 .",
    "the instability criterion implying cycles given in ( [ e4.3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath240 here the factor @xmath241 does not vary much , whereas @xmath242 is mainly sensitive to the type of companion and the mechanism driving the binary evolution , while @xmath243 depends on both the accretor and donor type . in fig .",
    "4 we plot @xmath122 along the abscissa ( the compact object axis ) and @xmath242 along the ordinate ( the companion axis ) . changing",
    "the type of companion causes displacements along both axes , whereas changing the primary causes only horizontal displacements .",
    "the stability / instability boundary plotted is simply @xmath244 .",
    "the locations of various possible evolutionary sequences for cvs and lmxbs are also shown on fig .",
    "4 . changing @xmath79 by screening or scattering causes purely vertical displacements since @xmath245",
    "is not affected : clearly for any binary there is a value of @xmath79 below which mass transfer is stable . within the limitations of the simple theory developed here ( i.e. the form chosen for @xmath246 ) the results displayed on fig.4 show the following :    \\1 .",
    "cvs above the period gap and above a certain period ( or companion mass ) can be unstable , depending on the value of @xmath101 ( see paper i ) .",
    "cvs below the gap are stable .",
    "long period cvs with companions having small core masses are stable , whereas companions with larger core masses likely to have even longer orbital periods are unstable .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that gk per and v1017 sgr are unstable if @xmath247 and 0.04 respectively .",
    "period lmxbs with main sequence or partially evolved companions are stable because they are so strongly irradiated that they have reached saturation ( @xmath248 ) .",
    "thus variations in @xmath154 do not cause radius variations , eliminating the feedback necessary for instability .",
    ". long period lmxbs with ( sub)giant companions are unstable : the larger the core mass and the smaller the total companion mass , the more violent the instability .",
    "the irradiation instability may well cause the formation of ultrashort  period systems ( e.g. the am cvn s ) from long  period cvs and lmxbs .",
    "however , since the rise to the high state is so rapid it is extremely improbable that we currently observe any long  period lmxb undergoing cycles .",
    "we must therefore consider ways of quenching the instability in these systems .",
    "the most obvious possibility is screening of the companion from the irradiation , which is the basic cause of the instability .",
    "screening may well result from the extensive disc coronae inferred in lmxbs ( e.g. white & mason , 1985 ) .",
    "formally we can consider this possibility by decreasing @xmath79 in our simulations .",
    "as can be seen from equation ( [ e5.4 ] ) the effect of a small @xmath79 is to lower the high branch and thus reduce the amplitude of the cycle in @xmath154 . since the lower branch remains unaffected , the turning radius and hence the radial amplitude will also be reduced .",
    "this suggests that screening could reduce the amplitude of the cycle and increase the frequency of outbursts , because it will take less time to drive the system into contact again once it has detached following an outburst .",
    "however this argument applies only to a fixed @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath249 is itself a function of the instantaneous mass transfer rate , as a result of a varying geometrical thickness of the accretion disk or varying optical depth through the ( out)flow , a more gradual transition occurs .",
    "for example , if screening results in a rapid reduction of @xmath79 beyond some critical @xmath250 , the amplitude of the cycle in @xmath154 is reduced , saturating somewhere close to @xmath250 , whereas the radial amplitude remains large ; thus the outburst does not recur any sooner than in the unscreened case .",
    "we have performed some numerical experiments to simulate these effects and verify the above statements .",
    "these simulations and the discussion above imply that if @xmath251 , the radial amplitude of the cycle and recurrence time are not significantly different from the unscreened case .",
    "however , if @xmath252 , then both the radial amplitude and the duration of the low state are reduced . also the duration of the high state and the amount of mass transferred per cycle are decreased .",
    "clearly if @xmath250 is reduced to @xmath253 we will find that the cycles disappear altogether .",
    "thus efficient screening can either eliminate the cycles entirely or render them relatively harmless as far as the binary evolution is concerned .",
    "while screening must play a role in stabilizing some systems against the irradiation instability , a second way of quenching the instability appears to be more common .",
    "this mechanism uses the fact that the companion swells only when its own intrinsic luminosity is blocked by the irradiating flux , and that the blocking effect saturates once the latter is comparable with the intrinsic flux .",
    "a variable accretion rate , as seen in e.g. soft x  ray transients , severely reduces the efficiency of irradiation in expanding the companion : the very high irradiating flux during outbursts has no more effect than a much weaker value , while the star can cool between outbursts .",
    "we might thus expect a highly modulated accretion rate with a duty cycle @xmath254 to mimic irradiation by a steady accretion rate a factor @xmath255 smaller .",
    "this expectation is largely fulfilled , as the following simple calculation shows .",
    "we assume the dimensionless accretion rate to vary periodically in time over @xmath256 as @xmath257 mass conservation requires that the dimensionless transfer rate obeys @xmath258 \\label{e7.3}\\ ] ] where @xmath259 is the duty cycle and @xmath260 the amplitude of the accretion rate variation .",
    "the reaction of the companion to this intermittent irradiation is governed by the thermal relaxation function ( [ e5.1 ] ) , which now becomes @xmath261\\ , r^3-r^{-(\\nu+2)}\\right\\ } , \\qquad 0<t\\leq t_h\\ ; , \\ ] ] [ e7.4 ] and @xmath262\\ , r^3-r^{-(\\nu+2)}\\right\\ } , \\qquad t_h < t\\leq t_{\\rm rec}\\ ;",
    ". \\label{e7.5}\\ ] ] now assuming that the cycle time @xmath256 is @xmath263 , we can define a mean value @xmath264 performing the integration , we can compute the derivative @xmath265 which governs the stability of the fixed point @xmath266 . if @xmath267 , i.e. @xmath268 , as is characteristic of soft x ",
    "ray transients and dwarf novae , we have @xmath269 and the criterion for instability @xmath270 can be written as @xmath271 this criterion is very similar to the earlier one ( [ e7.1 ] ) assuming steady accretion , to which it of course reduces as @xmath272 .",
    "for @xmath273 the two criteria are identical . thus on fig .",
    "4 the stability / instability boundary for @xmath274 is given simply by sliding the @xmath275 curve parallel to itself along the asymptote for small @xmath122 , by a displacement of @xmath276 in @xmath122 . we may thus draw a further conclusion from figure 4 :    \\5 .",
    "typical soft x  ray transient duty cycles @xmath277 are probably enough to stabilize most lmxbs with evolved companions against the irradiation instability .",
    "by contrast , extremely short duty cycles @xmath278 would be required for dwarf nova outbursts to stabilize cvs with evolved secondaries .",
    "we note that most lmxbs with periods @xmath279 d are transient ( king , kolb & burderi , 1996 ) , and indeed this holds for a very large fraction of long  period systems also ( king , kolb & burderi , 1996 ; king et al .",
    ", 1996b ) .",
    "we shall consider the application of the stability criteria to individual systems in a future paper .",
    "we have shown that irradiation of an evolved low  mass companion in lmxbs and cvs can drive mass transfer cycles .",
    "these cycles do not need the intervention of any further effect , unlike the case of main  sequence companions ( paper i ) , where a modest increase in the driving angular momentum loss rate is required in the high state if cycles are to occur in many cases .",
    "the cycles with evolved companions are also considerably more violent than in the main  sequence case .",
    "this is a direct consequence of two facts .",
    "first , the nuclear luminosity of an evolved star is insensitive to the stellar radius , so that blocking of the intrinsic stellar flux by irradiation requires the star to expand so as to maintain the same unblocked area .",
    "this leads to much larger expansions than in the main  sequence case , where the nuclear luminosity drops sharply as the star expands .",
    "second , the ratio @xmath280 of driving to thermal timescales is much larger in evolved stars than on the main sequence , making the expansion very rapid . in the high state",
    "an evolved star would lose a significant fraction of its total envelope mass on a thermal timescale .    in a cv with a low core mass",
    ", the implied accretion rate would probably turn the system into a supersoft x  ray source . in cvs with higher core masses",
    ", the nuclear burning causes the white dwarf to develop an extensive envelope , while in long  period lmxbs , the high state accretion rates greatly exceed the eddington limit . if the instability is not quenched all these systems would undergo a common  envelope phase .",
    "they may merge entirely , or reappear as ultrashort ",
    "period systems like am cvn ( for white dwarf primaries ) , or helium  star lmxbs , or detached systems with low  mass white dwarf companions . however , there are at least two ways in which the instability can be quenched and the systems ( particularly lmxbs ) stabilized : shielding of the companion by e.g. an extensive accretion disc corona , and intermittent accretion .",
    "the typical duty cycles @xmath277 observed in soft x ",
    "ray transients are short enough to stabilize them , while observed dwarf nova duty cycles are unable to stabilize cvs with evolved companions .",
    "although both means of stabilization seem to occur in nature , it is clear that the irradiation instability is so violent that it must play a major role in any discussion of the evolution of cvs and lmxbs with evolved companions : the systems must somehow stave it off or evolve catastrophically . we shall consider some of the observational consequences in a future paper .",
