    "ultracold atomic gases in lattices provide a promising experimental platform to help tackling many important problems in multidisciplinary fields . among these topics ,",

    "are obtained for both bose and fermi gases in optical lattices , so that various phase transitions can be investigated  greiner-02 , ketterle .    to experimentally investigate these phase transitions ,",
    "present techniques with ultracold atomic gases heavily rely on detection based on the time - of - flight imaging , where the interference pattern and its visibility are suggested to be signatures of bose condensation within an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "recent studies show that even for a thermal lattice gas above the bec transition temperature @xmath0 , interference peaks with observable visibility are still present  @xcite",
    ". this thermal visibility can be large for an ideal bose gas in a homogeneous lattice , which could make the condensation signal ambiguous  diener-07 .",
    "however , for practical systems with atomic interaction and an inhomogeneous global trap , the thermal visibility becomes significantly smaller  @xcite , and the appearance of sharp interference peaks is still associated with the bec transition .",
    "it is also suggested that the bimodal structure of the atomic momentum distribution in the first brillouin zone , combined with the interference peaks , provides an additional unambiguous signal for the bose condensation in an optical lattice  yi-07 .",
    "a very recent experiment has used the onset of the bi - modal distribution and the associated condensate fraction to identify the superfluid - to - mott - insulator transition point nist .    in this manuscript",
    ", we provide a detailed study of a bose gas in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) inhomogeneous optical lattice , both below and above the bec transition temperature .",
    "we discuss several properties including the visibility , the width of the interference peak , and the momentum distribution of the resulting interference pattern .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "first , all the quantities mentioned above can characterize the bec transition for the experimental systems with interacting atoms in an inhomogeneous optical lattice .",
    "the large thermal visibility applies only to some particular parameters which are not directly responsible for current experiments . in the case when the thermal visibility is large , a substantial variation of the peak width or the appearance of a bimodal structure for the atomic momentum distribution may work as a better signature for the condensation transition .",
    "second , below the bec transition temperature , the visibility and the peak width become insensitive to the system temperature , hence can not be applied as a practical thermometer . to fulfill this gap , the bimodal structure of the atomic momentum distribution gives a way to extract the condensate fraction through the bimodal fitting .",
    "the resulting condensate fraction provides a sensitive indicator of the system temperature , hence may serve as a potential thermometer for this important system .",

    "the problem is significantly simplified such that exact solutions are available .",
    "these exact solutions , on the one hand , are valuable for qualitative understanding of the system and its properties , and on the other hand , could be directly compared with experiments when the feshbach resonance technique is applied to turn off the atomic interaction . after studying the free bose gas",
    ", we then extend our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : inter ] to the case of interacting bosons , where effects of the global harmonic trap and the interaction have to be taken into account together . in order to deal with the trap",
    ", we adapt the local density approximation ( lda ) , which works well when the interaction energy scale is significantly larger than the trapping energy scale ( this condition is typically valid for current experiments ) . restricting our discussion to weakly interacting bosons that are away from the mott region",
    ", we apply the hartree - fock - bogoliubov - popov ( hfbp ) approximation to deal with the atomic interaction  @xcite .",
    "the hfbp method can provide a reliable description except for a narrow region around the bec transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the effect of the global trap , this questionable region only corresponds to a thin shell in three dimensions and its influence to the global properties is small .",
    "therefore , we expect that the hfbp method can give reliable results for the atomic momentum distribution and the condensate fraction .",
    "in this section , we discuss an ideal bose gas in an inhomogeneous optical lattice with a global harmonic trap . for completeness , we briefly review the formalism  @xcite before presenting various calculation results .",

    "furthermore , since @xmath31 and @xmath29 are separable , this hamiltonian can be reduced to three one - dimensional problems which require much less effort to solve .",

    "the spatial dependence of number density is only through the chemical potential @xmath151 , hence the integration can be rewritten as @xmath152 for a thermal gas with a certain number density and chemical potential at the trap center , the function @xmath153 , and hence the integration over @xmath154 in the equation above is fixed .",
    "thus , all the trap can do is to re - scale the quasi - momentum distribution by a factor of @xmath155 . for a given optical lattice characterized by a wannier function",
    ", the momentum - space density profile of a thermal gas for various values of @xmath74 takes the identical shape , hence all signatures we can read from it must remain the same .",
    "notice that since the lda approach is reliable for all parameter ranges discussed here ( with @xmath156 hz ) , we conclude that this result is the effect of a strong interaction compared to the trapping potential , which can not be smoothly connected to the non - interacting results .    in fig .",

    "fig : width - inter , the peak width significantly reduces across the bec transition , so a sharp peak with a small width sets a clear indicator that the system is in the condensate region .",

    "this result is significantly different from the case of an ideal bose gas , where at zero temperature it is always a pure condensate .",
    "this discrepancy is due to quantum depletion of the condensate at zero temperature , which is always present for an interacting gas . in the zero temperature limit",

    "however , this simple trend becomes more complicated in a trapped case .",
    "in fact , due to the presence of a global trap , thermal wings must emerge at the edge at any finite temperature .",
    "as one calculate the in - trap condensate fraction , an integration over the whole trap should take the thermal wings into account , and the result will inevitably depend on how much the thermal part contribute to the total number . as an example , we show the in - trap number and condensate density profiles in fig .",

    "[ fig : n0-inter ] is a consequence of the inhomogeneous distribution of different phases with various number density and chemical potential , which are results from the inhomogeneity of the trap .      up to now",
    ", we have calculated the atomic momentum distribution inside the trap and have neglected modification of this distribution caused by the atomic interaction during the time - of - flight expansion . during the expansion of the atomic cloud , the initial interaction energy is transferred to the kinetic energy , which tends to broaden the momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "this influence is most evident for the condensate part , due to its high number density and narrow momentum distribution at the beginning .",
    "the influence on the momentum distribution of the thermal and the non - condensate part is negligible , as confirmed by experiments  @xcite , since this part has a broad initial momentum distribution already , and the weak atomic collisions are unlikely to cause any significant modification . in the following ,",
    "we only discuss influence of the atomic collisions on the condensate part of the momentum distribution .",
    "after turnoff of the optical lattice and the confining potential , the atomic cloud undergoes a free expansion in space , and the expansion of the condensate part can be well described by a time dependent gross - pitaevskii ( tdgp ) equation @xmath185 where the initial condition @xmath186 ( @xmath22 is the expansion time ) is given by the equilibrium condensate wave function inside the optical lattice and global trap , which has been calculated with the method detailed in the above .",
    "note that only for the condensate part we use the tdgp to evolve its momentum distribution .",
    "it is easier to understand the consequence of this evolution by looking at the tdgp equation in the momentum space .",
    "the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( eqn : tdgp ) gives @xmath187 clearly , without atomic collisions ( the @xmath113 term ) , the momentum distribution @xmath188 remains unchanged .",
    "the atomic collisions transfer a pair of atoms from momenta ( @xmath189 ) to ( @xmath190 ) , which modulates the overall momentum distribution .        to understand the consequence of the collision induced momentum transfer , we note that the initial condensate momentum distribution has a number of peaks , one in each brillouin zone . as the central peak in the first brillouin zone",
    "( with @xmath19 close to zero ) is the highest one , the scattering of pairs of atoms around the first peak satisfying the momentum conservation has the largest contribution to the collision effect . around the central peak ,",
    "the wave function @xmath191 has approximate spherical symmetry , and the evolution of the momentum distribution around the central peak by the tdgp equation has been calculated and shown in ref .",
    "the condensate peak gets somewhat lower and broader , however , its width is typically still significantly less than the width of the thermal cloud , and a bimodal structure of the momentum distribution remains clearly visible .",
    "thus , the collision during the time - of - flight expansion has some quantitative influence on the peak width we calculate before , but the effect is not large and it should not change all the qualitative discussions in the last sections .",
    "in particular , as the bimodal structure remains clearly observable , we do not expect that the condensate fraction measured through the bimodal fitting to the momentum distribution has any significant change by the collision effect during the expansion .    in the next order ,",
    "the atom in the central peak can collide with another atom in the secondary peak , and scatter to some other directions in the momentum space .",
    "the momentum difference between the central peak and the secondary peak is given by @xmath192 ( @xmath192 is related to the lattice constant @xmath5 through @xmath30 ) , so the kinetic energy difference between them corresponds to a large energy scale @xmath193 , which is typically larger than the interaction strength during the expansion [ the latter can be estimated by @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the instantaneous atomic density at the collision ] .",
    "therefore , to be effective , the collisions need to satisfy the momentum conservation as well as an approximate energy conservation in the momentum space . as a consequence , for atoms with incoming momenta around @xmath196 and @xmath197 ( corresponding to the central and the secondary peaks , respectively ) , the outgoing atoms are centered around a spherical surface in the momentum space as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] [ with momenta @xmath198 , where @xmath199 .",
    "the sphere has origin at @xmath200 and a radius of @xmath201 .",
    "this collision effect causes some blurring of the original peaks .",
    "since the scattered atoms are dominantly around a sphere in the momentum space , this blurring scattering gives some characteristic momentum distribution pattern .",
    "experimentally , by looking at such a pattern , one may measure and constraint the magnitude of collision effects during the time - of - flight expansion .    at high orders",
    ", there could be also scattering between different secondary peaks as well as scattering between the central and even higher order peaks .",
    "although these scattering can change some of quantities we calculate before , we expect all these modifications are pretty small .",
    "in summary , we have discussed in this manuscript ideal as well as interacting bose gases in an inhomogeneous optical lattice within a global harmonic trap . by explicitly calculating the momentum distribution , we have studied several possible signatures of the bec transition in an lattice based on the common detection technique of time - of - flight imaging . for parameters of relevance to the current experiments ,",
    "a large visibility , a substantial decline of the peak width , and the appearance of a bimodal structure for the central peak , can all be used as signals of the condensation transition as one decreases the temperature . for some other parameters ,",
    "the thermal visibility could be significant , and in such a case the latter two criteria will work better .",
    "in particular , the appearance of a bimodal structure for the momentum distribution is a robust signal associated with the condensation transition in both free space and lattice ( in the lattice case , the interference peaks give further information about the underlying lattice structure ) .",
    "after the condensation transition , both the visibility and the peak width become insensitive to the variation of temperature , so they can not serve as a practical thermometer .",
    "instead , one may measure the condensate fraction by a bimodal fitting to the atomic momentum distribution .",
    "the condensate fraction changes steadily with temperature , and may work as a good experimental indicator of the system temperature by comparing with the results from theoretical calculations .                                  the cases of different lattice structures and anisotropic trapping potentials can be analyzed analogously , provided that the anisotropy of the global trap is not strong enough to cause a breakdown of lda .",
    "in this paper , we have assumed that the expansion time is long enough so that the final absorption image represents the initial momentum distribution ( the far - field limit ) . in real experiments , the expansion time may be not long enough to achieve this far - field limit ( i. bloch , private communication ) .",
    "this leads to some effective momentum broadening effect seen in observation , which looks similar to the momentum broadening caused by the atomic interaction .",
    "however , these two effects should be distinguished .",
    "according to the calculation here , the interaction induced momentum broadening is actually not significant for a condensate with a moderate density ( such as about one atom per site ) . the effective broadening effect seen in observation caused by the finite expansion time in principle",
    "can be undone theoretically if one knows the initial condensate profile and the expansion time ."
