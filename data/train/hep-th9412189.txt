    "in this work , we will review some of the known classical and quantum properties of black holes , with special emphasis on two dimensional black holes .",
    "+   + the general theory of relativity shows that if a star is sufficiently massive , no force can counterbalance its gravitational force so that it will collapse under its own weight .",
    "this theory further predicts that the endpoint of the collapse is a black hole , which is an object from which nothing can come out , at least if quantum effects are neglected .",
    "some classical properties of four dimensional black holes are reviewed in section 2 .",
    "+   + in 1975 , hawking discovered that black holes are not black : if quantum effects are taken into account , the black hole is found to emit particles with a thermal spectrum . in hawking s calculation , which is described in section 3 , the gravitational field of the black hole",
    "is treated classically but the matter radiated away is assumed to propagate in the fixed classical spacetime geometry of the black hole by the laws of quantum mechanics . +   +",
    "since the outgoing hawking radiation is a form of energy , it should modify the gravitational field of the black hole ; this effect is called the back reaction of the radiation on the geometry . in particular",
    ", the back reaction should cause the mass of the black hole to decrease , the mass of the black hole being a property of the spacetime geometry .",
    "the effect of the back reaction is very difficult to analyze in @xmath0 dimensions ; therefore , one is tempted to simplify the problem by going to @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "+   + such a two dimensional model was proposed in 1991 by callan , giddings , harvey and strominger .",
    "this so - called cghs model is the subject of section 4 .",
    "+   + at the classical level , the cghs model has black hole solutions ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the effect of back reaction can be studied at the ( matter ) one - loop level ( section 4.3 ) .",
    "one finds that the mass of the black hole decreases , as expected .",
    "indeed , in one particular version of the cghs model , the so - called rst model , proposed by russo , susskind and thorlacius , the black hole is found to evaporate completely ( section 4.3 ) . +   + however , the main motivation for studying two dimensional models was to resolve the problem of information loss : hawking discovered that the information contained in the matter which formed the black hole can not be encoded in the outgoing radiation because the radiation is purely thermal .",
    "therefore , most of the information is stored in the black hole .",
    "if the black hole evaporates completely , hawking s calculation suggests that the information content will be lost and this implies that the evolution of the black hole is not described by a unitary @xmath2-matrix ; therefore , quantum mechanics would not apply to black holes .",
    "+   + the hope was therefore raised that the two dimensional models would resolve the issue of information loss but unfortunately , no definite conclusions could be drawn .",
    "+   + several proposals have been made to resolve the information paradox in four dimensions , but as we will see in the conclusions , none of them is fully satisfactory today .",
    "in this section , we describe the geometry of the most general stationary black hole , the so - called kerr black hole ; we also define some useful quantities and finally , we derive some of its thermodynamical properties .",
    "more detailed reviews of classical black holes can be found in ( * ? ? ? * and 12 ) and @xcite .",
    "+   + the interaction between the gravitational and the electromagnetic field is governed by the coupled einstein - maxwell equations . in the lorentz gauge @xmath3 , they are : @xmath4 + where @xmath5 is the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor : @xmath6 +   + the general stationary black hole solution subject to the constraints that the mass , angular momentum and electric charge of the black hole take definite values , is described by the kerr metric @xmath7 and the electromagnetic potential @xmath8 where @xmath9 +   + @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the three parameters of the family of solutions and",
    "can be verified to be the electric charge , the mass and the angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole , respectively . +   + when @xmath13 , the metric reduces to the reissner - nordstrom metric @xmath14 + and when @xmath15 , we recover the scharzschild metric @xmath16 which for symplicity we will analyze below .",

    "the resulting maximally extended scwarzschild spacetime is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch1 ] .",
    "+   + another representation of this spacetime can be obtained by mapping @xmath35 to null coordinates whose ranges are restricted to finite intervals , for example @xmath36 +   + the resulting `` conformal '' or `` penrose '' diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch2 ] .",
    "+   + the most salient feature of the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime is that it has a future event horizon @xmath37 , i.e. , a null hypersurface from behind which it is impossible to escape to future null infinity @xmath38 without exceeding the speed of light .",
    "it also has a past event horizon @xmath39 , i.e. , a null hypersurface behind which it is impossible to go when starting from past null infinity @xmath40 .",
    "+   + both the past and the future event horizon are located at @xmath19 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sch1 ] .",
    "+   + the singularity at @xmath41 is a true physical singularity for example , @xmath42 is infinite there .",
    "however , thanks to the horizons , it can not be seen from outside the black hole , that is , from region @xmath43 in fig .  [",
    "fig : sch1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sch2 ] .",
    "+   + for a collapsing star , only part of region @xmath43 and @xmath44 will be generated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] ) .",
    "+   + as for the general kerr black hole , it has been proved that it is the only possible stationary vacuum black hole , i.e. , a classical black hole is characterized uniquely by its mass , angular momentum and electric charge : a black hole has no hair . to show this in a special case",
    ", we try to find the stationary solutions of the klein - gordon equation in the schwarzschild metric .",
    "decomposing the solution in spherical harmonics , we will show later that the radial part @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 because the second derivative with respect to @xmath47 is strictly positive outside the black hole , a solution which vanishes exponentially at infinity must blow up at the horizon since @xmath48 there .",
    "thus , there is no physically acceptable stationary solution to the klein - gordon equation , and a schwarzschild black hole has no klein - gordon charge .",
    "+   + from ( [ eq : kerr ] ) , we see that the kerr metric is singular where @xmath49 and where @xmath50 . + evaluation of curvature invariants such as @xmath42 shows that the singularity at @xmath51 is a real singularity when @xmath52 , which can not be removed by extending the manifold .",
    "+ when @xmath53 , there are no solutions to the equation @xmath54 : we are left with a `` naked '' singularity at @xmath51 , so in this case the kerr solution is not physically acceptable .",
    "+ however , when @xmath55 , @xmath56 vanishes at @xmath57 .",
    "it has been shown that the latter singularities ( at @xmath58 ) are of the same nature as the @xmath19 singularity in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "in particular , the horizon at @xmath59 prevents an external observer from seeing the real singularity at @xmath51 .",
    "+   + a conformal diagram of the extended charged kerr spacetime with @xmath60 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kerr ] , for the non - extreme case @xmath61 .",
    "+   + in a physically realistic gravitational collapse , the spacetime is expected to be qualitatively similar to that depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] because of instabilities associated with the so - called cauchy horizon at @xmath62 .",
    "+   + for a rotating black hole , @xmath60 , the killing field @xmath63 which is a null generator of the horizon does not coincide with the time translation killing field @xmath64 .",
    "the other killing field available being @xmath65 , we must have @xmath66 + so the event horizon is rotating with angular velocity @xmath67 .",
    "it can be calculated by requiring @xmath63 to be null on the horizon",
    "@xmath68 +   + so @xmath69 +   + another important quantity is the surface gravity of the black hole @xmath70 . for a static non - rotating black hole",
    ", it can be defined as the force exerted by a stationary observer at infinity on a stationary particle with unit mass ( the particle can be thought of as being connected to the observer by means of a long massless string ) .",
    "+   + the four - velocity of the particle is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the redshift factor , so the acceleration is @xmath73 and the magnitude of the local force per unit mass is @xmath74 +   + @xmath12 goes to infinity as one approaches the horizon because the redshift factor @xmath75 goes to zero .",
    "+   + the force at infinity can be defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy per unit mass of the stationary particle as measured by the stationary observer at infinity @xmath78 +   + we see that @xmath79 +   + for a schwarzschild black hole @xmath80 and @xmath81 +   + for a rotating black hole , we define @xmath82 by @xmath83 where now @xmath84 +   + it can be shown @xcite that @xmath70 is constant over the event horizon so we can evaluate it at @xmath85 . using @xmath86",
    ", we get @xmath87 + @xmath70 appears in the relation between the killing parameter @xmath88 along the null generator of the horizon defined by @xmath89 and the affine parameter @xmath90 along the same generator : it can be proved @xcite that @xmath91 + this shows that the null coordinate @xmath34 that we defined earlier when we analyzed the schwarzschild metric is an affine parameter along the future horizon because we had @xmath92 .",
    "+   + the area @xmath93 of the event horizon of a kerr black hole is @xmath94 +   + clearly , the area of the event horizon is constant in time .",
    "this is a special case of the black hole area theorem which hawking proved in 1971 by using global properties of spacetime : it states that the total area of all black holes in the universe can not decrease , @xmath95 .",
    "the area of a black hole is thus analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamical system , and in fact , the area theorem is sometimes called the second law of black hole dynamics .",
    "+   + there is also an analogous first law which we now derive by studying the variation of @xmath93 with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath96 @xmath97 + now @xmath98 + so @xmath99 where we have used @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "+   + thus @xmath102 +   + this suggests that the laws of black hole dynamics are really the laws of thermodynamics applied to black holes . in this case , the temperature and entropy of the black hole are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "however , for classical black holes , the temperature is zero because a classical black hole only absorbs energy without emitting anything",
    ". this would be in contradiction with the conjecture made above .",
    "when quantum effects are taken into account , this paradox is resolved because , as was first shown by hawking , a black hole emits radiation like a blackbody at temperature @xmath105 ( see next section ) , and therefore , the entropy of a black hole is @xmath106 .",
    "the black hole radiance was found @xcite by studying the propagation of quantized , noninteracting matter fields in the classical geometry of the black hole .",
    "+   + the simplest example one would consider is a neutral spin zero particle described by the real klein - gordon field which propagates in region i of the extended schwarzschild spacetime , fig .",
    "[ fig : sch2 ] . +   + it satisfies the equation @xmath107 where @xmath108 +   + here @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and all non - diagonal components are zero .",
    "+ also @xmath112 , so @xmath113 +   + setting @xmath114 , the equation becomes : @xmath115 or @xmath116 +   +",
    "now @xmath117 so we end up with the equation : @xmath118 +   + this equation has the form of a wave equation for a massless scalar field in a flat two dimensional spacetime with a scalar potential @xmath119 where we have specialized to @xmath120",
    ". +   + as @xmath121 or @xmath122 , @xmath123 , i.e. , the potential vanishes exponentially .",
    "+ as @xmath124 or @xmath125 , the potential vanishes at least as @xmath126 .",
    "+   + thus , in the asymptotic past , any solution reduces to the sum of two free wave packets , one coming from the white hole horizon @xmath39 , called @xmath127 , and one coming from past null infinity @xmath40 , called @xmath128 .",
    "+   + similarly , in the asymptotic future , any solution reduces to the sum of two free wave packets : one going towards the black hole horizon @xmath37 , @xmath129 , and one going towards future null infinity @xmath38 , @xmath130 .",
    "+   + any incoming one particle state is thus the linear combination of a one particle state coming from @xmath39 and a one particle state coming from @xmath40 @xmath131 + @xmath132 is defined as the vector space of all solutions @xmath128 containing only positive frequencies with respect to some null coordinate @xmath133 @xmath134 +   + here @xmath135 is the natural choice because @xmath40 is an asymptotically flat region and in this region , @xmath136 are minkowskian ( null ) coordinates , @xmath137 .",
    "+   + however , there is an ambiguity in the definition of @xmath138 because @xmath139 is _ not _ asymptotically flat and as a consequence , there is no unique choice of @xmath140 : we could choose it to be either the killing parameter @xmath141 or the affine parameter @xmath142 . +   + for the collapsing spherical body of fig .

    "fig : coll ] , the spacetime contains no white hole horizon so @xmath143 is just @xmath132 and is therefore uniquely defined .",

    "+   + we assume that the fock space @xmath145 of the quantum field @xmath146 is isomorphic to the fock space @xmath147 of incoming particles , where @xmath147 is the direct sum of the hilbert spaces of no particle states , one particle states , two particle states and so on . let @xmath148 denote this isomorphism . +   +",
    "if we define @xmath149 where @xmath150 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath143 for @xmath151 in the asymptotic past @xmath152 , we see that for these @xmath151 s , @xmath153 is the usual free field operator in flat spacetime .",
    "+   + in the same way , we denote by @xmath154 the isomorphism between @xmath145 and @xmath155 and we define @xmath156 where @xmath157 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath158 for @xmath151 in the asymptotic future .",

    "+   + since @xmath172 is isomorphic to @xmath173 , any @xmath174 can be written as : @xmath175 where @xmath176 , and @xmath177 and @xmath178 are orthonormal bases in @xmath179 resp . @xmath180 .",

    "+   + coming back to the fundamental equation  ( [ eq : smat ] ) , @xmath189 we can solve for @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the vacuum state of @xmath192 : we write @xmath193 where @xmath194 is an @xmath195-particle state of @xmath172 , i.e. , @xmath196 and apply both sides of  ( [ eq : smat ] ) to @xmath181 @xmath197 or @xmath198 where we have defined @xmath199 and @xmath200 . +   + using the definition of @xmath201 and @xmath202 , we obtain the equations @xcite @xmath203 +   + the solution is @xmath204 so @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the two particle state corresponding to @xmath207 . +   +",

    "+   + for an eternal black hole ( not formed by gravitational collapse ,  fig .",

    "+   + another late time basis in @xmath229 can be constructed as follows : denote by @xmath230 and @xmath231 the solutions in the eternal black hole spacetime that have the form @xmath232 at @xmath139 resp .",

    "so @xmath246 and @xmath247 +   + @xmath206 is determined by the action of the operator @xmath248 on @xmath249 : if we propagate the wave packet corresponding to @xmath245 backwards in time from @xmath250 , it will be almost entirely scattered back to @xmath152 by the static schwarzschild geometry and the resulting wave packet will be the purely positive frequency wave packet @xmath235 . hence",
    "@xmath251 +   + on the other hand , the wave packet corresponding to @xmath252 is completely transmitted ( backwards in time ) to the surface of the collapsing body because in the extended schwarzschild spacetime it would , by definition , be transmitted in its entirety to @xmath39 . for an observer on the collapsing body , the wave packets with sufficiently high @xmath195 will have the form @xmath253 +   + because @xmath254 goes to infinity on the event horizon , the surfaces of constant phase of @xmath255 pile up close to it ( see fig .

    "the latter condition is equivalent to imposing that the total central @xmath624 vanishes .",
    "+   + second , as @xmath699 , the action should reduce to the classical cghs action and in addition , the leading order corrections in powers of @xmath395 should describe a radiating black hole with a radiation flux proportional to the number @xmath346 of matter fields . +   + moreover , it is desirable that the semiclassical equations are solvable .",
    "+   + a more detailed review on the quantization of the cghs model is given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "+   + several models satisfying the above requirements have been found @xcite , but here , we will only describe the one proposed by russo , susskind and thorlacius @xcite . +   + these authors included a second one - loop term in addition to the polyakov action in a way that preserves a global symmetry present in the classical cghs action : @xmath700 @xmath693 is the classical cghs action , and @xmath701 . +   + one should also add the contributions from the ghosts , @xmath188 and @xmath361 , to the conformal anomaly but we will not elaborate this further .",
    "we only state that it is possible to do this in such a way that @xmath702 and without affecting our final results , see @xcite .",

    "+   + in region @xmath732 , the modified solution turns out to describe a shifted dilaton vacuum : @xmath737 +   + now @xmath738 where we used @xmath739 +   + therefore , the solution is continuous across @xmath740 .",
    "evaluating @xmath741 , we find that its change across @xmath740 is @xmath742 +   + this corresponds to a shock wave @xmath743 +   + this shock wave carries a small amount of negative energy @xmath744 out to infinity .",
    "+   + in this model therefore , the black hole evaporates completely .",
    "as we have seen in section 3 , hawking s calculation of the black hole radiance yields radiation in a mixed thermal state . for a `` superobserver '' , who is able to see the quantum state @xmath311 of the total fock space @xmath745 , the state is pure but from the point of view of an observer outside the black hole , who can only access @xmath746 , the same state is viewed as a mixed state .",
    "+   + most of the information contained in the incoming state will end up behind the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "this information which from the point of view of the external observer is lost , can be quantified by calculating the so - called entropy of entanglement which is given by @xmath747 where @xmath188 is the density matrix describing the mixed thermal state at future null infinity .",
    "if @xmath188 had arised from a pure state , the entropy would have been zero but in the case of a mixed state , it is positive .",
    "+   + as we saw in section 3 , the density matrix is obtained from @xmath311 by `` tracing over '' all horizon states but it can also be obtained directly by applying the so - called superscattering operator @xmath748 on the in - state ; @xmath748 is obtained from the @xmath2-matrix by tracing over the horizon states @xmath749 +   + we recall that the calculation of @xmath188 is valid only in the semiclassical regime , when the gravitational field of the collapsing star can be described by a classical real - valued metric .",
    "therefore , the calculation breaks down when the mass of the black hole approaches the planck mass because at this point , the quantum fluctuations of the metric are expected to become important and of course , the theory describing the quantum fluctuations at this scale is unknown . +   + we assume for the moment that the unknown planckian dynamics cause the black hole to evaporate completely _ and _ that the information disappears with the black hole , i.e. , the out - state is still described by a mixed state even after the evaporation . in this case , the evolution from in - state to out - state is governed by the superscattering operator @xmath748 rather than by a unitary @xmath2-matrix ; in other words , the usual rules of quantum mechanics are modified in the presence of black holes .",
    "this very radical proposal was made by hawking in 1976 @xcite . since then , however , several authors have argued that this @xmath748-matrix evolution would violate energy conservation and destabilize the vacuum , see @xcite .",
    "+   + another possibility is that the planckian physics shuts off the hawking radiation when the black hole reaches the planck mass .",
    "hence , the information is stored forever in a planck - mass remnant , and quantum mechanics is not violated .",
    "the main criticism against this scenario is that it is difficult to believe in the stability of the remnant in the absence of any conservation law .",
    "+   + a third proposal is that the information is encoded in the hawking radiation which therefore is in a pure state .",
    "+   + one possibility is that the information is reemitted during the whole lifetime of the black hole , in direct contradiction with hawking s calculation .",
    "naively , it seems impossible to realize this idea because the information can not be reemitted to future null infinity and at the same time go to the black hole : if we assume that a pure in - state evolves to an out - state which is a product state , then a superposition of in - states would evolve to a mixed state ; hence , the assumption that the out - state is always a product state is not consistent with the superposition principle .",
    "one says that information duplication is not possible in quantum mechanics .",
    "+   + however , the above argument against unitary evolution has been criticized by susskind who postulates that there is no combined quantum description for a freely falling observer approaching the horizon and a distant observer who remains outside the black hole .",
    "quantum mechanics is valid for each of them separately and in particular , for the external observer , the evolution of quantum states is unitary .",
    "contradictions would certainly arise if the external observer and the freely falling observer could compare their experiments but they can not , since the freely falling observer disappears into the black hole ; the two descriptions are _",
    "this principle of black hole complementarity is the basis of the approach by susskind @xcite .",
    "this principle implies that planck scale physics enter in the description of the distant observer during the whole process of the evaporation of the black hole , not just in its final stage , as is assumed in hawking s calculation .",
    "this is because the redshift between a point close to the horizon and infinity is enormous .",
    "+   + susskind has proposed to describe a black hole in terms of a membrane just outside the event horizon ( its area is defined to be one planck unit larger than the area of the event horizon ) , the so - called stretched horizon , which would absorb and reemit all the information contained in the incoming state @xcite . the membrane description had already been useful for classical black holes , see the references in @xcite . from the point of of view of the distant observer , the stretched horizon behaves like a real physical membrane . in particular , its temperature is so high ( of the order of the planck temperature ) , that a freely falling observer is seen to be destroyed ; but the freely falling observer sees himself passing through the event horizon without problem , since from his point of view , the stretched horizon does not even exist ! +   + susskind @xcite , and before him t hooft @xcite , have speculated that the degrees of freedoom of the stretched horizon are described by string theory but it is not known if string theory really provides a mechanism by which the stretched horizon can reemit the original information encrypted in the outgoing radiation , although there are some indications in favor of such a possibility .",
    "+   + still another possibility is that the information is reemitted after the black hole mass has reached the planck mass ; the restoration of information is then governed by planckian dynamics which we know nothing about .",
    "however , general arguments indicate that the information is reradiated very slowly @xcite : a four dimensional black hole with initial mass @xmath11 evaporates down to planck size in time @xmath750 , but the decay time for the planck - size remnant is much longer , at least @xmath751 , which for a mass of the order of the sun mass is an enormously large number ( @xmath752 ) .",
    "the problem is again how to explain such a very long decay time , so we are back to the case of an absolutely stable remnant",
    ". +   + have the two dimensional models resolved the information paradox ? +   + in the rst model , the information does not come back , at least as long as the semiclassical equations are valid .",
    "hence , if the information comes back at all , it is when the black hole reaches the analog of the planck mass and the result would be a long - lived remnant .",
    "unfortunately , there are other versions of two dimensional gravity which are claimed not to lead to information loss @xcite",
    "so even in two dimensions , the information paradox has not been resolved .",
    "in fact , the physical relevance of two dimensional models has been questionned : it seems likely that it is not possible to truncate the four dimensional theory to include only spherically symmetric modes @xcite .",
    "+   + one possible resolution of the black hole information paradox is simply that black holes do not exist .",
    "one should perhaps look for alternatives to general relativity , for example the recently proposed non - symmetric gravitational theory @xcite .",
    "the static spherically symmetric solution of this theory , corresponding to the schwarzschild solution , is everywhere regular and does not contain any event horizon .",
    "black holes are replaced by superdense objects that are stable for arbitrary large masses , due to a new repulsive force that counterbalances the usual attractive gravitational force .",
    "moreover , by choosing a particular parameter entering in the solution to be sufficiently small , the theory agrees with general relativity for the scales where it offers a good description of the experimental data .",
    "+   +   +   + even if this new theory does not survive , it remains an open possibility that black holes do not exist , because they still have to be identified with certainty ."
