    "an issue of obvious interest is to find classes of _ exact _ periodic solutions supported by periodic pseudopotentials , and also ultimate cases of such states with the infinite period , representing matter - wave solitons .",

    "the difference of this case from the one with @xmath49 is that the respective nl function @xmath3 is a sign - constant one , i.e. , the nonlinearity is locally attractive everywhere ( which makes the modulational instability of stationary periodic solutions quite plausible ) .",
