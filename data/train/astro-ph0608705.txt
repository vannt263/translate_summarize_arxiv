    "the galactic warp was revealed early from hi data ( kerr 1957 ) , which was further supported from ( 1 ) the @xmath57 distribution of various spiral arm tracer populations , e.g. open star clusters etc , as a function of longitude ( e.g. pandey & mahra 1987 , pandey et al .",

    ".    it will be worthwhile to compare the distribution of reddening material towards the bps with the distribution of reddening material near the sun .",
    "for this purpose we followed the approach described by pandey & mahra ( 1987 ) and obtained distribution of @xmath63 as a function of @xmath62 in 11 zones of galactic longitude within 3 kpc from the sun using the catalogue of open clusters compiled by dias et al .",

    "a least - square solution for sinusoidal function manifests that the plane defined by reddening material shows a maximum upward tilt towards @xmath68 or maximum downward tilt towards @xmath69 .",
    "this result is in agreement with our previous findings ( pandey & mahra , 1987 ) .",
    "8 indicates that in the longitude range @xmath70 ( mean @xmath51 = @xmath71 ) , @xmath67 has a mean value of about -25 pc and at @xmath72 , the @xmath67 is found to be @xmath73 pc .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath67 towards above mentioned longitudes are in good agreement with the results obtained for the bps in fig . 7 . here",
    "we have to keep in mind that the downward maximum tilt towards @xmath3 found in fig .",
    "8 should be considered as a local downward maximum for the population located within few kpc of the sun .",
