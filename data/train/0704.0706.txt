    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has about twenty known snrs .",

    "infrared studies are very limited in spite of their advantages in understanding the interstellar medium of this nearby , metal - poor irregular galaxy as well as in understanding the nature of snrs .    in this paper , we report the detection of the snr  ( j010619@xmath1720527 ; ikt 25 ; hereafter ) in the smc in the 2.615  range by the infrared camera ( irc ) onboard .",
    "this is the _ first _ snr detected in this ir band in the smc .",
    "the only other snr detected in mid - infrared waveband in the smc is the radio / x - ray bright snr b0102.2@xmath172.19 , which was observed by @xcite using the _ spitzer space telescope _ and detected only at 24 .",
    "is the faintest radio snr in the smc , located in the northwestern area of the `` wing '' close to the `` bar '' .",
    "it is small ( @xmath2 or 29 pc at the distance of 60 kpc ) , and its radio structure is not well resolved @xcite .",
    "the faintness together with its relatively small spatial extent led @xcite to suggest that it is possibly a balmer - dominated type ia snr . on the other hand",
    ", the remnant has a flat radio spectrum with a spectral index @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) , which suggests a possibility of crab - like snr or ` plerion ' .",
    "the remnant has been studied in x - rays using _ rosat _ and _",
    "xmm_. @xcite showed that the x - ray emission is composed of a diffuse emission extending along the north - south direction and a point - like source at the southern end .",
    "they tentatively identified the point - like source as a be / x - ray binary system and proposed a core - collapse sn origin for the remnant .",
    "@xcite obtained an x - ray spectrum of the remnant using the _ xmm - newton _ observatory and showed that the fe abundance is enhanced with respect to the mean o , ne and mg abundance values .",
    "they concluded that the x - ray emission is possibly from ejecta remains of type ia . in summary",
    ", the radio and x - ray observations do not yield a coherent picture on the nature of the remnant .",

    "n3 , n4 , s7 , and s11 images have isophotal wavelengths of 3.19 , 4.33 , 7.12 and 10.45 @xmath7 m with effective bandwidths of 0.87 , 1.53 , 1.75 and 4.12 @xmath7 m , respectively .",

    "the basic calibration and data handling including dark subtraction , linearity fitting , distortion correction , flat fielding , and image combining were processed using the standard irc imaging data reduction pipeline version 070104 @xcite .",
    "we , however , used our own flat images derived from the north ecliptic pole data around our observing date for the mir - s , because the irc mir - s flats have noticeable `` dark pattern '' and , if we use the provided superflats , it leaves an artifact even after the flat - fielding ( see irc data user s manual ) .",

    "it has the maximum inside the ir - ne shell and an extended ` plateau ' to southwest , which is confined to a relatively narrow region .",
    "the 2.37 ghz map ( fwhm=@xmath21 ) of @xcite obtained by using the australian telescope compact array shows essentially the same radio morphology .",
    "it is possible that the remnant has a shell structure in the radio too but is smeared because of the poor resolutions of these interferometric observations .",
    "we have simulated how the remnant would appear with a large beam if the radio brightness is proportional to that of the ir shell .",
    "we convolved the s7 image , where the shell is most prominent , with a gaussian beam of fwhm=@xmath20 .",
    "the simulated map also shows a centrally brightened remnant , but its peak occurs close to the ir - ne shell , @xmath22 north to the peak of the 843 mhz emission .",
    "another difference between the simulated and the observed radio maps is that , in the former , there is a separate peak at the position of the ir - sw shell while , in the latter , the intensity decreases smoothly toward the southwest .",

    "the contamination due to the muxbleed in the bands n3 and n4 is also estimated and subtracted . the conversion to astronomical fluxes",
    "is performed by using the conversion factors in the irc data users manual , which were derived from standard stars .",

    "this will give an extinction of 0.04 mag at 3.2  using the extinction cross sections in the milky way and smc provided by @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 .",

    ", we have derived the fluxes of the bright spot in the ir - ne shell and they are listed in table 1 too .",
    "its irc colors agree well with those of the ir - ne shell .",
    "the fluxes in table 1 are the fluxes within ellipses excluding the areas occupied by point sources , which amount to a significant portion ( 1535% ) of the ellipses , so that they represent rough estimates for the fluxes of the sources .",
    "the colors , however , should be relatively accurate because they are the ratios of fluxes of the same areas .",
    "the errors are due to uncertainties in the flux calibration and background subtraction .",
    "the absolute flux calibration of the irc array for a point source is accurate to 56% @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration for an extended source is different from a point source , because the incident lights are scattered in the irc array and this diffuse scattered light is not included in the point source flux calibration but is partly included for an extended source ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "according to @xcite , 45% of the incident light of a bright source is lost as scattered light spread in horizontal direction in s7 and s11 .",
    "but the correction factor depends on the brightness distribution of the source and wavelength , and has not been fully studied yet . for the ir shells , which are not truly extended sources",
    ", we consider that 10% is a reasonable number for the error in color associated with this extended - source correction .",

    "the radio continuum is faint and the ir brightness distribution is considered to be different from that of radio continuum (   3 ) , so that the synchrotron emission contribution should be negligible .",
    "the absence of an associated x - ray emission indicates that it is probably not the thermal emission from collisionally - heated dust in x - ray emitting hot plasma .",
    "also , the `` flat '' irc color can not be achieved unless the plasma density is unacceptably high for usual grain size distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the abundance of pah molecules may be enhanced in snr shells because shocks can convert a significant fraction of mass in large grains into small grains or pahs @xcite .",

    "we therefore consider that the observed nir / mir emission from  is either forbidden ionic lines or h@xmath0 lines , or both , from shock - heated gas .",

    "such numerical studies , however , is beyond the scope of this paper . we simply conclude that the observed ir emission is consistent with a molecular shock , i.e. , a shock propagating into molecular gas , although we can not rule out some possible contribution from ionic lines .",

    "according to our analysis , the ir emission is probably from shocked molecular gas , which indicates that  is interacting with molecular clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "the centrally - filled thermal x - rays support this conclusion because many of the galactic snrs interacting with mcs do show such x - ray characteristics , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the faint optical filaments associated with the ir shells are not unexpected , because molecular clouds are clumpy and shocks propagating through diffuse interclump medium could be fast @xmath42 shocks .",
    "most of the observed ir emission , however , might be from slow ( @xmath54  ) non - dissociative , or partially dissociative shocks propagating into dense clumps .",
    "such multiple shocks of different natures are expected and have been observed in several galactic snrs interacting with molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a prototypical one is ic 443 ( g189.1 + 3.0 ; @xcite ) .",
    "ic 443 is interacting with both atomic and molecular gas , so that , in the optical , its northeastern shell that is interacting with diffuse atomic gas is bright , while , in the mir , e.g. , in the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) 8.28  band , the southern shell interacting with molecular gas is bright .",
    "its extent ( 20 pc ) is somewhat smaller than .",
    "it also has faint optical filaments over the entire remnant .",
    "x - rays are bright inside the remnant , which is of thermal origin ( @xmath55 kev ; @xcite ) . therefore ,  is quite similar to ic 443 and might be a middle - aged ( @xmath56  yrs ) snr expanding in a multiphase interstellar medium .",
    "the interaction with mcs suggests that  is possibly a core - collapse snr with a massive progenitor star .",
    "our analysis indicates that the radio nebula is probably inside the ir shell , and it could be a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) considering its flat spectrum .",
    "the radio nebula appears too large for a middle - aged pwn , but it is possible that the nebula can be rejuvenated through the interaction with the snr shell as in the galactic snr ctb 80 @xcite .",
    "ctb 80 is another snr where the snr shell is detected in ir , i.e. , in an iras 60 to 100  color map .",
    "it is an old ( @xmath57  yr ) snr where apparently its pulsar is interacting with the snr shell to produce a large ( @xmath58 pc ) synchrotron nebula .",
    "the flux of  ( @xmath59 mjy at 1 ghz ) is an order of magnitude less than that of ctb 80 , which would be @xmath60  mjy if it were in the smc .    on the other hand ,",
    "there have been suggestions that  is a type ia snr @xcite .",
    "it is not impossible for a type ia snr to be interacting with mcs , e.g. , tycho @xcite .",
    "the radio nebula may have a morphology similar to the optical image rather than the ir image as in ic 443 , although its spectral index is rather unusual for a shell - type snr .",

    "is the first snr detected in the 2.615  bands in the smc .",
    "it is the faintest known smc snr in the radio and is not particularly bright in x - rays .",
    "the brightest two smc snrs in x - rays are snrs b0102@xmath172.3 ( ikt 22 ) and b0103@xmath172.6 ( ikt 23 ) , which are both young oxygen - rich snrs @xcite .",
    "b0102@xmath172.3 is also one of the brightest radio snrs .",
    "b0102@xmath172.3 was observed by @xcite using the _ spitzer space telescope _ and was detected at 24  ( 80 mjy ) , but neither at 8 nor 70 , which was interpreted as thermal emission from hot dust at @xmath61 k. the @xmath14 upper limit at 8  was 3 mjy .",

    "the flux of ic 443 , which is at the same distance , estimated from the msx data is @xmath63 jy at 8.28 .",
    "therefore ,  would be a bright , but not an exceptionally bright snr in the galaxy .",
    "it is also significantly fainter than the brightest nir / mir snrs in the large magellanic cloud , e.g. , n49 and n63a , whose fluxes are 3241 mjy and 130300 mjy in the _ spitzer _ irac 3.6/4.5 and 5.8/8.0  bands , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "n49 is also known to be interacting with mcs @xcite .",

    "<S> we present a serendipitous detection of the infrared - bright supernova remnant ( snr )  in the small magellanic cloud by the infrared camera ( irc ) onboard . </S>",
    "<S> an elongated , partially complete shell is detected in all four observed irc bands covering 2.615 . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared shell surrounds radio , optical , and x - ray emission associated with the snr and is probably a radiative snr shell . </S>",
    "<S> this is the _ first _ detection of a snr shell in this near / mid - infrared waveband in the small magellanic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the irc color indicates that the infrared emission might be from shocked h@xmath0 molecules with some possible contributions from ionic lines . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that  is a middle - aged snr interacting with molecular clouds , similar to the galactic snr ic 443 . </S>",
    "<S> our results highlight the potential of  irc observations in studying snrs , especially for diagnosing snr shocks . </S>"
