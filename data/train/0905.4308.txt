    "several years ago it was suggested that neutrinos might interact weakly among themselves through the exchange of a very light scalar particle  @xcite , with possible consequences for the evolution of the universe and for the propagation of neutrinos from distant events .",
    "we examined such a system for scalars with astrophysical ranges to explore the possibility of neutrino clustering  @xcite and noted at the time that the neutrino clouds thus formed could seed structure formation in the early universe . more generally , in such clouds of massive fermions interacting by exchange of a light scalar field , the effective mass of the fermion can become negligibly small .",
    "we found that , as a consequence , when the cloud expands , the effective mass and the total energy density must eventually increase with decreasing density .",
    "we studied this system in 1996  @xcite , well before the discovery of dark energy , in connection with experimental problems encountered in the search for the mass of the ( electron ) neutrino .",
    "those anomalies have since disappeared , but provided us with the technology to describe dark energy in a well understood dynamical system .    in the following ,",
    "we first review our previous work on the theory of massive fermions interacting via exchange of a scalar field .",
    "this is carried out with scaled variables so the regime of applicability is not constrained .",
    "we next recall the relation between dark energy and equations of state and define the @xmath0 parameter used therein . after this",
    ", we apply our model results for @xmath0 and discuss the numerical , analytical and scaling properties relevant to the accuracy of our results .",
    "penultimately , we extract a rough mass value from applying those results to describe dark energy assuming the currently accepted value for its energy density in the epoch corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and discuss some open questions .",
    "the effective lagrangian for a dirac field , @xmath2 , interacting with a scalar field , @xmath3 , is : @xmath4 + g{\\bar{\\psi}}{\\psi}\\phi\\ ] ] which gives as the equations of motion @xmath5\\phi & = & g{\\bar{\\psi}}{\\psi}\\label{eq : phi}\\\\ \\left[i{/\\!\\!\\!\\partial}- m_{\\nu}^{(0)}\\right]{\\psi } & = & -g \\phi { \\psi}.\\label{eq : psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as usual , we set @xmath6 . we have omitted nonlinear scalar selfcouplings here , even though they are required to exist by field theoretic selfconsistency ,  @xcite as they may consistently be assumed to be sufficiently weak as to be totally irrelevant .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is the renormalized vacuum mass that the fermion would have in isolation , and takes into account any contributions from all other interactions , as well as contributions from the vacuum expectation value of the new scalar field , @xmath3 .",
    "we look for solutions of these equations in infinite matter which are static and translationally invariant .",
    "eq.([eq : phi ] ) then gives @xmath8 which , when substituted in eq.([eq : psi ] ) gives an effective mass for the fermion of @xmath9    these equations are operator equations .",
    "we next act with each of these equations on a state @xmath10 defined as a filled fermi sea , with a number density @xmath11 per fermion state , and fermi momentum @xmath12 , related as usual by @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath14 acting on this state gives @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of fermion states which contribute  @xmath17 for majorana fermions and @xmath18 for dirac fermions .",
    "thus the effective mass is determined by an integral equation @xmath19    to discuss the solutions of this equation , we reduce it to dimensionless form , dividing by @xmath7 , and introducing the parameter @xmath20 and the variables @xmath21",
    ". then eq.([eq : mstar ] ) becomes @xmath22,\\label{eq : yx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 .",
    "this choice of scaled variables gives all energies ( and momenta ) in units of the vacuum fermion mass .",
    "for consistency , we define the dimensionless scalar mass as @xmath24 in these same units .",
    "one can regard eq.([eq : yx ] ) as a non - linear equation for @xmath25 as a function of either @xmath26 or @xmath27 . as a function of @xmath26 , @xmath25 is multiple valued ( when a solution exists at all ) , whereas @xmath25 is a single valued function of @xmath27 .",
    "the total energy of the system is a sum of the energy of the fermions , @xmath28 , and the energy in the scalar field , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the total number of neutrinos in each contributing state .",
    "these expressions serve to define the per fermion quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 . also ,",
    "@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the energy density of the ( here uniform ) scalar field .",
    "one finds that @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the total energy density per fermion is just the sum , @xmath37    notice that for large values of @xmath27 , @xmath38    it is also useful to note that , for small @xmath27 , @xmath39    for the fermion system to be bound , the minimum of @xmath40 as a function of density ( or @xmath27 ) must be less than 1 , its value in the zero density limit .",
    "fig.([fig : eyvsx ] ) shows the variation of @xmath41 and @xmath25 as a function of @xmath27 for several values of @xmath42 .",
    "note that for sufficiently large @xmath42 , there is a minimum relative to both the large and small @xmath27 regimes , that is , relative to regions of both large and small fermion density .     and",
    "effective mass @xmath25 vs. @xmath27 for several values of @xmath42 . ]     and @xmath0 vs. log(@xmath27 ) for @xmath43 . ]",
    "thinking of this in terms of expansion of the universe , early times correspond to the large @xmath27 region on the right and late times , including presumably the present , are to the left .",
    "thus we see that at some intermediate period , the energy density passes through a minimum and as the system approaches the present , it passes through a regime in which the energy density is increasing as the number density decreases  characteristic of a regime of negative pressure .",
    "fig.([fig : ywvsxk11 ] ) gives an advance peek at the value of the equation of state parameter , @xmath0 , that we derive from the dependence of @xmath41 vs. @xmath27 .",
    "we will demonstrate later how we do this numerically , but it should be noted that there are still some numerical difficulties evidenced by the `` hash '' in the low @xmath27 limit where we know that @xmath44 as the cold , now non - interacting fermion `` dust '' turns effectively into new `` dark matter '' .",
    "in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe , einstein s equations produce the second order time derivatiive equation of motion that relates the expansion ( size ) scale parameter , @xmath45 , to newton s constant , @xmath46 , the matter density , @xmath47 , pressure , @xmath48 , and a cosmological constant , @xmath49 : @xmath50 therefore , it is necessary to know the relevant equation of state ( eos ) before the time development of the scale factor can be determined . for dust , which has no pressure , @xmath51 , while for a relativistic gas , @xmath52 .",
    "note that acceleration of the expansion parameter occurs , even in the absence of a cosmological constant , when @xmath53 . finally , for a spatially and temporally homogenous scalar field , @xmath54 , which is more than enough to produce acceleration of the expansion .",
    "more generally , we can parametrize equations of state in this regime by a constant , @xmath0 , as @xmath55    there are a great number of models for this dark energy phenomenon .",
    "they go by names such as `` quintessence '' for @xmath56 , or `` phantom energy '' for @xmath57 . among others ,",
    "this issue has been addressed by fardon , nelson and weiner  @xcite , peccei  @xcite , barshay and kreyerhoff  @xcite , baushev  @xcite and mukhopadhyay , ray and choudhoury  @xcite .      for the system under consideration , the total ( matter plus field ) energy is given by the product of the total energy density per fermion @xmath58 and the total number of fermions , which in turn is determined by the number density @xmath11 times the volume , @xmath59 : @xmath60 where we recall that @xmath61 is the fermion number density .",
    "the pressure is defined by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the internal energy given above .",
    "since @xmath64 is a constant , @xmath65    from this and eq.([eq : eos ] ) , we can identify @xmath66 this is our central model result .",
    "in fig.([fig : wvslogxf ] ) , we shows the value of @xmath0 as computed numerically from eq.([eq : w ] ) for 8 values of @xmath67 on a log scale for @xmath68 and in fig.([fig : wvslinxf ] ) for @xmath69 on a linear scale . note that it approaches close to @xmath70 as the density decreases ( as the universe expands and the scale factor @xmath45 increases from right to left ) and then departs sharply towards zero , as also indicated earlier in fig.([fig : ywvsxk11 ] ) .     vs. log(@xmath27 ) for 8 values of @xmath42 .",
    "]     vs. @xmath27 for 8 values of @xmath42 . ]    at large @xmath27 , it is clear that @xmath0 approaches @xmath71 as it should for a relativistic gas of fermions .",
    "it is perhaps less clear , due to numerical fluctuations , that the value goes to zero at zero density .",
    "this can be checked by considering the small @xmath27 expansions of the energy densities shown at eq.([eq : lel ] ) .",
    "finally , we performed a number of numerical scaling checks to examine whether @xmath0 can fall below @xmath70 .",
    "the are shown in figs.([fig : wmin1],[fig : wmin2],[fig : wmin3 ] ) .     from @xmath70 vs. @xmath42 . ]     vs. @xmath27 at which minimum occurs , for several values of @xmath42 . ]     vs. logarithm of @xmath27 at which minimum occurs , for several values of @xmath42 . ]    we are continuing our efforts to ensure numerical stability primarily by seeking analytic formulae and approximations , especially to avoid taking derivatives numerically .",
    "we will report on these improvements elsewhere , but suffice it to say that we have found no contradiction to the results obtained here by purely numerical means , and confirmed that the difficulties encountered at very small @xmath27 are indeed due to numerical noise .",
    "all of the above is carried out with scaled variables .",
    "however , was shown in ref.[3 ] , there are only a few , weak constraints on the actual parameter values .",
    "very large values of @xmath42 are possible even for very small values of @xmath72 if the range of the scalar is very large , corresponding to very small values of @xmath73 . even if long - ranged , such weak interactions between fermions , especially neutrinos or those outside of the standard model altogether ( such as the lsp ) are exceptionally difficult to constrain by any laboratory experiments .    the energy density of dark energy is quoted  @xcite as @xmath74 . in more manageable units ,",
    "this is given as @xmath75 .",
    "what does this imply for the allowed value of @xmath76 ?",
    "if we set this energy density equal to that of this system at @xmath77 , @xmath78 then solving for @xmath7 gives @xmath79 if we further suppose that this occurs at cosmological @xmath80 , then the range of the scalar field must be comparable to the size of the universe at that time .",
    "that is , @xmath81 for the relatively modest value of @xmath82 , this implies that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "these values emphasize the virtual impossibility of constraining this physics by means of laboratory experiments .",
    "we note with interest that following the curve for @xmath25 from @xmath1 to `` now '' , i.e. , @xmath85 , tells us that the effective mass of this fermion would now be measured to be approximately @xmath86 , a value tantalizingly close to the majorana neutrino mass that prof .",
    "klapdor has reported from his experiments  @xcite .",
    "other solutions are possible , and fig.([fig : scaling ] ) shows how our results scale very accurately ( for sufficiently large @xmath42 ) with the 4th root of @xmath42 , both numerically and under one of our analytic approximations to the region where @xmath0 is a minimum .",
    "in particular , if one has the lsp at @xmath87 tev in mind , @xmath42 becomes very large , @xmath88 and @xmath89 also increases , @xmath90 , but these values are not ruled out by anything known .    , vs. @xmath42 . ]",
    "we have displayed an explicit and calculable dynamical mechanism that describes dark energy and connects it to what in the current epoch becomes a kind of dark matter .",
    "although dark matter is usually thought of as existing at early epochs in the life of the universe , the system described here turns ( hot ) relativistic fermions , that interact weakly with a very light scalar field , into dark energy which lasts for a limited time during the expansion of the universe which then morphs into new cold dark matter components .",
    "thus , neutrinos can contribute to both . nor",
    "need there be only one time scale or one species for which this applies .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref.[12 ] . )",
    "if there are many sterile fermions with sufficiently long decay lifetimes , the acceleration / deceleration history of the universe could be much more complicated that presently envisioned .",
    "we may also ask generally why @xmath91 , but it is fairly clear in this model : a scalar field strength uniform in space and time produces  @xcite exactly @xmath77 , but here the source for the scalar field is the density of massive fermions .",
    "relativistically , their strength for producing scalar field is severely reduced at high momentum ( in the rest frame of the universe ) but as they slow , the scalar field strength grows nonlinearly until , due to the expansion of the universe , the fermions separate so much ( greater than the yukawa range for exchange of the scalar field ) that they can not act collectively and the scalar field strength declines again .",
    "finally , we note that our model has definitive if difficult tests , as it predicts specific variations of @xmath0 , slowly approaching @xmath70 from above as @xmath92 decreases through 1 , and rising rapidly towards zero as @xmath92 approaches the present .",
    "we hope this encourages observationalists in their efforts to discern variation of @xmath0 with @xmath92 .",
