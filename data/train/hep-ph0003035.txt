    "the inclusion of heavy quark effects in deeply inelastic scattering ( ) is an interesting theoretical problem involving two hard scales in a perturbative analysis .",
    "this issue is also of phenomenological importance .",
    "the charm contribution to the total structure function @xmath8 at small @xmath9 , at hera , is sizeable , up to @xmath10 . through the charm contribution to scaling violations",
    ", the treatment of charm also has a significant impact on the interpretation of fixed target deeply inelastic scattering data .",
    "thus , a proper description of charm contributions to deeply inelastic scattering is required for a global analysis of structure function data and a precise extraction of the parton densities in the proton .    at scales",
    "@xmath11 , the contribution to deeply inelastic scattering of a heavy quark of mass @xmath12 can be calculated in the so - called fixed - flavor - number ( ffn ) prescription from hard processes initiated by light quarks ( @xmath13 ) and gluons , where all effects of the heavy quark ( @xmath14 ) are contained in the perturbative coefficient functions .",
    "this prescription incorporates the correct threshold behavior , but for large scales , @xmath15 , the coefficient functions at higher orders in @xmath16 contain potentially large logarithms @xmath17 , which may need to be summed @xcite .",
    "such a summation can be achieved by including the heavy quark as an active parton in the proton .",
    "the simplest approach incorporating this idea is the so - called zero - mass variable - flavor - number ( zm - vfn ) prescription , where heavy quarks are omitted entirely below some scale @xmath18 and included as massless partons above this threshold .",
    "this prescription has been used in global analyses of parton distributions for many years , but it has an error of order @xmath19 and is not suited for quantitative analyses unless @xmath15 .    considerable effort has been devoted to including heavy quark effects in deeply inelastic scattering in such a way that the calculated structure functions match those of the ffn prescription in the region @xmath20 while they match those of the zm - vfn prescription for @xmath21 .",
    "two prescriptions of this sort , the aivazis  collins  olness  tung ( acot ) @xcite and the thorne  roberts @xcite prescriptions have been used in recent global analyses of parton distributions @xcite .",
    "more recently , additional variable - flavor - number prescriptions with non - zero mass have been defined in the literature @xcite .",
    "if one could sum perturbation theory , the calculated structure functions should be identical for any prescription that does not neglect the heavy quark mass .",
    "however , the way of ordering the perturbative expansion is not unique , so that the results generally differ at any finite order in perturbation theory .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate a modification of the acot prescription advocated by collins  @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage of being simple to state and of allowing relatively simple calculations",
    ". this simplicity should be convenient for phenomenological analyses at the born level .",
    "in addition , it could be crucial for implementing a variable - flavor - number prescription with non - zero mass at next - to - leading order in global analyses of parton distributions .",
    "we consider the structure function @xmath22 .",
    "the observable structure function can be written in terms of parton distribution functions @xmath23 and a calculable partonic structure function @xmath24 as @xmath25 this factorization formula has corrections of order @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a typical scale of hadronic physics , perhaps the mass of the rho meson . here",
    "@xmath28 is the renormalization / factorization scale .",
    "( for simplicity , we do not distinguish these two scales . )",
    "the partonic @xmath24 has a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath29 .",
    "there is a sum over parton types @xmath30 , and there is a function @xmath31 for each parton .    to begin , we must pick a scheme for the definition of @xmath16 and for the definition of the parton distribution functions .",
    "in fact , we will use multiple schemes , following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "each scheme is designated by the number @xmath32 of `` active '' quark flavors .",
    "scheme @xmath32 is designed to be most useful for physical scales @xmath33 in the range @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mass of the @xmath32th quark flavor .",
    "we define what we mean by the running coupling @xmath36 in scheme @xmath32 by defining how we perform renormalization .",
    "we renormalize using the cwz prescription @xcite .",
    "briefly , divergences involving active parton loops are removed with an  subtraction , but when active parton external lines couple to a loop containing `` non - partonic '' lines ( quarks @xmath37 ) the renormalization is by subtraction at zero external momentum .",
    "the running of @xmath36 is controlled by the usual renormalization group equation with the contributions from quarks @xmath38 in the beta function .    in the scheme @xmath32",
    "there are parton distributions for gluons and for quark flavors @xmath38 , but not for quark flavors @xmath39 .",
    "the parton distribution functions are defined to be proton matrix elements of certain operators @xcite .",
    "the operator products are ultraviolet divergent and are renormalized according to the cwz prescription .",
    "they obey a renormalization group equation  the usual dglap equation  in which contributions from quark flavors @xmath39 do not appear in the kernel .",
    "note that the parton distribution functions are non - perturbative objects .",
    "there is no question of neglecting any masses in the definition .",
    "the quark masses do not appear in the kernel of the evolution equation , but this is because renormalization counter terms are mass independent , not because the parton distributions themselves are mass independent .",
    "note also that by using cwz renormalization throughout , quark loops for the non - partonic flavors decouple from calculations when the momentum scale is small compared to @xmath40 .",
    "thus for @xmath41 it is a good approximation to leave the non - partonic flavors out of calculations altogether .",
    "( but leaving heavy flavors out of calculations is not part of the definition of scheme @xmath32 as used here ; it is a separate approximation . )",
    "when one does leave the non - partonic flavors out of calculations , the remaining renormalizations are via the  prescription .",
    "thus one commonly refers to parton distributions in the prescription described here as  parton distributions .",
    "there is a perturbative connection between schemes @xmath32 and @xmath42 which we can represent by : @xmath43 here the index @xmath44 runs over @xmath45 , the @xmath32 light quarks and their anti - quarks , and the heavy quark @xmath14 and anti - quark @xmath46 . for @xmath47 we define @xmath48 in the first term on the right hand side .",
    "the index @xmath49 runs over only the gluon and light quarks . at order @xmath16 ,",
    "the only nonvanishing @xmath50 is @xmath51 .",
    "thus we may say that the @xmath14 distribution arises perturbatively from @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 terms in the perturbative expansion of the @xmath54 vanish at @xmath55 .",
    "thus one derives the simple matching conditon @xcite : @xmath56 .",
    "the analogous connection is known at order @xmath57 but we do not repeat it here . , the matching at @xmath55 is no longer continous in general @xcite . ]",
    "when we construct the hard scattering cross section in the presence of heavy quarks , there is a factorization ambiguity that is not present in the case of light quarks .",
    "let us see why .",
    "consider two enormously simplified examples that illustrate the principle .",
    "first , suppose that there are only gluons and one light quark @xmath58 with mass @xmath59 .",
    "suppose , in addition , that the light quark is its own anti - particle , so that a quark @xmath58 and the anti - quark @xmath60 are the same particle .",
    "both the gluon and the light quark are considered to be active partons . in order to simplify the notation ,",
    "let us take a moment @xmath61 of @xmath8 , so that we get a factorization formula involving the corresponding moments of @xmath62 and of the parton distributions .",
    "the dependence on the moment number will not be indicated . to further simplify the notation ,",
    "let us set the factorization and renormalization scale @xmath28 to @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath63 now @xmath8 is an observable , so its definition is fixed .",
    "we have defined the parton distribution functions , and the two parton distribution functions are independent . thus this equation all but fixes the definition of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the only possible modification would be to add terms proportional to powers of @xmath66 to @xmath67 , at the cost of subtracting the same terms from the power suppressed remainder , @xmath68 , in the factorization formula ( ) .",
    "the simplest solution , which is uniformly adopted , is not to allow a @xmath66 dependence in @xmath69 .",
    "now suppose that there are only gluons and one ( self - conjugate ) heavy quark @xmath14 with mass @xmath70",
    ". then in the scheme in which both the gluon and the heavy quark are considered to be active partons we have @xmath71 here the @xmath72 ( a = g , h ) depend on the heavy quark mass and we can not move terms of order @xmath19 into the power suppressed corrections because only terms of order @xmath26 are allowed there .",
    "thus it seems that we have no freedom .",
    "but we do : @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not independent .",
    "since , according to , heavy quarks evolve from gluons , we have a relation of the form @xmath75 here @xmath76 has a perturbative expansion that is obtained by solving the evolution equation .",
    "the first term has the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant . using in we",
    "obtain @xmath79 evidently , there is some freedom to move pieces from the first term in braces to the second .",
    "there is a constraint . for @xmath80 ,",
    "it is possible to neglect @xmath12 in the calculation of the @xmath62 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath81 does not have a smooth @xmath80 limit .",
    "this is not a problem in applications because by solving the evolution equation one sums the leading logarithms @xmath82^n$ ] in @xmath76 .",
    "it is important not to undo this summation .",
    "thus the factorization scheme that we adopt should have the property that the functions @xmath72 have a finite limit as @xmath80 .",
    "this still leaves us the option of adding a term like @xmath83 to @xmath84 and subtracting @xmath85 from @xmath86 .",
    "suppose now that we have calculated @xmath87 and @xmath88 in some convenient prescription  for example the prescription analyzed in @xcite based on `` on - shell '' heavy quarks .",
    "then we could define a new prescription with @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the following subsection , we shall give a prescription @xcite based on this observation .",
    "having seen the main idea , let us put the parton indices and the momentum fraction variables back .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath42 quark flavors that we consider to be active .",
    "let the heaviest active quark , quark @xmath42 , be labelled @xmath14 .",
    "suppose that quark @xmath14 has a mass that is large compared to the hadronic mass scale @xmath27 . in the @xmath42 flavor scheme the factorization equation is @xmath91 where the sum over @xmath44 includes @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    the parton distributions for the gluon and @xmath42 quark flavors are obtained from the distributions in the scheme with only @xmath32 quark flavors .",
    "first we use the perturbative matching relation ( ) at a scale near @xmath94 , then we use the evolution equations to give the distribution functions at scale @xmath28 . since there are more output functions than input , we obtain a perturbative relation giving the heavy quark distribution functions at scale @xmath28 in terms of the light quark and gluon distribution functions at the same scale .",
    "this relation has the form @xmath95 with an analogous equation for the heavy anti - quark @xmath46 .",
    "inserting this relation into , we have @xmath96 where @xmath97 we see that we have the same situation as in the simple example given earlier . taking @xmath28 to be of order @xmath33",
    ", one can shift contributions of order @xmath19 between the hard scattering functions @xmath98 for @xmath14 and @xmath46 and the corresponding functions for the light quarks and the gluon while keeping the functions @xmath99 unchanged for each light quark and gluon flavor @xmath44 and without ruining the property that all of the functions @xmath62 have finite @xmath100 limits .",
    "this freedom can be exploited to make the calculation of the functions @xmath24 simpler . in particular",
    ", we can adopt a prescription proposed by collins @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ simplified acot ( s - acot ) prescription_. set @xmath12 to zero in the calculation of the hard scattering functions @xmath62 for incoming heavy quarks .",

    "imagine that the @xmath62 functions obeyed the usual renormalization equation and that @xmath102 were independent of @xmath12 at some fixed value of @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath62 for @xmath103 would depend on @xmath12 at other values of @xmath28 because the standard renormalization group equation mixes the heavy and light flavors and would mix @xmath12 dependence into @xmath102 .",
    "this simplified acot prescription has the advantage of being simple to state .",
    "in addition , its calculational simplicity could be crucial for applying variable - flavor - number prescriptions with mass in analyses that go beyond first order in @xmath16 .",
    "in this section , we analyze the acot prescription and its simplified version , the s - acot prescription , at order @xmath53 . we consider neutral current deeply inelastic scattering from a proton target in a @xmath0 regime in which quarks @xmath104 can be considered as light while a single quark , @xmath14 , is considered to be heavy or light depending on the value of @xmath0 . in order to keep the analysis simple , contributions from all heavier quarks",

    "we can summarize properties 1 and 2 by saying that the acot prescription interpolates between the zero - mass prescription for @xmath154 and the fixed - flavor - number prescription for @xmath155 .",
    "what about the simplified acot prescription ?",
    "we use the same formulas as for the acot prescription , but set @xmath141 in the hard scattering functions for heavy quarks : @xmath156 repeating the derivation just given , we see that properties 1 and 2 hold for the s - acot prescription .",
    "that is , the s - acot prescription also interpolates between the zero - mass prescription for @xmath157 and the fixed - flavor - number prescription for @xmath155",

    "in this section , we investigate how well the matching properties among the different prescriptions work . in the plots",

    "we compare @xmath175 calculated with the s - acot prescription at order @xmath16 with that calculated with the original acot prescription , the zm - vfn prescription in which the charm quark can appear as a parton but has zero mass , and the ffn prescription in which the charm quark has its proper mass but does not appear as a parton . for simplicity , we take @xmath162 . in our calculations , we evaluate the hard scattering coefficients @xmath176 at order @xmath16 .",

    "the fact that the acot and s - acot prescriptions match extremely well throughout the full kinematic range provides explicit numerical verification that the s - acot prescription fully contains the physics .",

    "we have performed a numerical study of different prescriptions for dealing with the quark mass in heavy quark leptoproduction .",
    "we have seen that the simplest prescription @xcite , s - acot , is numerically equivalent to the earlier acot prescription @xcite .",

    "finally , we emphasize that the choice of a prescription for dealing with quark masses in the hard scattering coefficients for deeply inelastic scattering is a separate issue from the choice of definition of the parton distribution functions . for all of the prescriptions discussed here , one uses the standard  definition of parton distributions .",
