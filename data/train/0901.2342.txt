    "strongly correlated quantum systems continue to pose central challenges in theoretical condensed - matter physics . in the case of one - dimensional systems , we now have a full range of techniques to address static and dynamic ground - state properties . however , condensed - matter experiments typically work at finite temperatures that can not be simply approximated by the ground - state physics , and the low - temperature physics of such systems is of high interest of its own . due to the homogeneity of the systems under study in space and time , the experimental responses",
    "are best represented in momentum - frequency space , as , for example , by spin structure factors @xmath2 where the average is taken with respect to some finite-@xmath3 density operator and @xmath4=i\\delta_{\\ell\\ell'}\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\gamma}\\hat s^\\gamma_\\ell$ ] .",
    "we will refer to functions of this form as spectral functions in the following ; the proposed method does not depend on the specifics .",
    "theoretical approaches to calculate such spectral functions with high accuracy are very limited . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental progress makes such calculations very timely : for example , due to small neutron flux , neutron - scattering techniques were in the past essentially limited to finding scattering maxima .",
    "now , they have advanced to a degree that both the amplitude and the lineshape , which contain important information on the many - body physics involved , can be investigated with high accuracy ( e.g.  refs .   and  ) .    for finite - temperature quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations ( e.g.  positive - definite path integral @xcite or stochastic series expansion @xcite representation ) , spectral functions have to be extracted by analytic continuation from imaginary - time results @xcite , which is ill - conditioned and numerically challenging . in the context of dmrg @xcite , early approaches for finite - temperature spectral functions",
    "have built on transfer - matrix dmrg @xcite , which gives thermodynamics for homogeneous infinite systems at high precision . in a first step , analytic continuation techniques as in qmc were employed @xcite . in a second development , transfer matrices were evolved in real - time to access autocorrelation functions @xcite ; the time scales reachable limit resolution in frequency space .",
    "while this approach would also be amenable to the prediction techniques used in the following to circumvent this issue , the determination of momentum - space correlators will be particularly easy with the @xmath0-dmrg methods@xcite we use . in an unrelated development , a",
    "ground - state dmrg - like technique has been proposed that invokes a random - sampling and averaging procedure @xcite .",
    "its feasibility for dynamical quantities has only been tested for very small systems ; it is also limited to low temperatures .    in this paper",
    ", we present an application of @xmath0-dmrg at finite temperatures .",
    "it is shown how a combination of this technique and the linear prediction method @xcite allows one to obtain very accurate results for spectral functions with frequency and momentum dependence in the entire temperature range .",
    "while the demonstration focuses on a few particular cases , it will be obvious that the approach generalizes straightforwardly .",
    "in recent years , dmrg @xcite has emerged as a key method for the ground - state physics of strongly correlated one - dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the time - evolution of pure states in one - dimensional strongly correlated spin , bosonic or fermionic models can now be simulated by @xmath0-dmrg @xcite over times 10 - 100 times longer than the typical inverse energy scale of the problem ( e.g.  inverse hopping energy ) .",
    "it was quickly demonstrated @xcite that this method can be easily extended to the simulation of the static and dynamic behaviors at @xmath5 by using the purification @xcite of the density operator : any density operator @xmath6 of some physical system @xmath7 can be encoded by a pure state of a combined physical and ancillary system , @xmath8 , such that the density matrix is retained by tracing out @xmath9 , @xmath10    the ancillary system @xmath9 can be taken as a copy of the physical state space @xmath7 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : mps - purification ] . in the case of interest , ( unnormalized ) thermal density operators @xmath11 , the corresponding purification can be constructed by an imaginary - time evolution starting from the purification of the ( trivial ) infinite-@xmath3 ( @xmath12 ) density operator @xmath13 . a possible purification for this @xmath12 ensemble is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the bases of the physical state space of site @xmath17 and its associated ancillary state space , respectively .",
    "with this , we have @xmath18 . finite temperatures @xmath19 are reached by imaginary - time evolution @xmath20 proper normalization is restored by imposing @xmath21 .",
    "the mixed state @xmath22 can then be evolved in time as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    as a product state",
    ", the initial @xmath12 purification @xmath25 is uncorrelated , and hence , for the dmrg simulation , can be expressed exactly with block hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath26 .",
    "imaginary - time evolution will introduce correlations , requiring one to increase @xmath27 .",
    "for the evaluation of expectation values , both physical and ancillary degrees of freedom are traced over . as an example , take @xmath28 while this approach has been found to yield thermodynamic quantities @xcite and static correlators @xcite at @xmath5 to very high accuracy , real - time simulations are plagued by the same limitations as at @xmath29 : the propagation of excitations through the system leads to entanglement growth in the purified state . as entanglement entropy is related roughly exponentially to dmrg resources , this strongly limits achievable simulation times , or inversely the @xmath30-resolution for spectral functions , as those are derived by fourier transformation from the real - time data . in order to circumvent this limitation at very low numerical cost ,",
    "we adapt a linear prediction technique @xcite already successfully employed at @xmath29 in ref .  .",
    "for a time series of complex data @xmath31 at equidistant points in time @xmath32 ( and @xmath33 ) one makes a prediction of @xmath34 . in our case , @xmath35 is the ( physical ) time where the @xmath0-dmrg calculation was stopped  usually because the computational cost to simulate further with a given accuracy has become too high . for the data points beyond @xmath36 , linear prediction makes the ansatz @xmath37 the ( predicted ) value @xmath38 at time step @xmath39 is assumed to be a linear combination of @xmath40 previous values @xmath41 .",
    "once the coefficients @xmath42 are determined from the known data , the ansatz is used to calculate ( an approximation of ) all @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath42 are determined by minimizing the least - square error in the predictions over a subinterval @xmath45 $ ] of the known data , i.e.  we want to minimize @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fitting interval @xmath48\\}$ ] , and @xmath49 is some weighting function ; we choose @xmath50 for our simulations .",
    "we found @xmath51 to be a robust choice .",
    "it is a compromise between choosing @xmath52 small enough to eliminate spurious short - time behavior from the true long - time behavior and choosing @xmath52 large to have a good statistics for the fit and allow for a large number @xmath40 of coefficients @xmath42 in the ansatz .",
    "minimization of the error @xmath53 , eq .  , with respect to the coefficients @xmath42 yields the system of linear equations @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the autocorrelations @xmath57 equation is solved by @xmath58 . for positive @xmath49",
    ", @xmath55 is a positive - definite matrix .",
    "one may wonder why the extrapolation to infinite time is possible in this fashion .",
    "as demonstrated below , linear prediction generates a superposition of oscillating and exponentially decaying ( or growing ) terms , a type of time dependence that emerges naturally in many - body physics : green s functions of the typical form @xmath59 are in time - momentum representation dominated by the poles ; e.g.  for a single simple pole at @xmath60 with residue @xmath61 , it will read @xmath62 , and similarly it will be a superposition of such terms for more complicated pole structures .",
    "so the ansatz of the linear prediction is well suited for the typical properties of the response quantities we are interested in .",
    "note , however , that the method is not generally applicable for genuine nonequilibrium situations , as e.g.  for the evolution of a local observable after a noninfinitesimal quench of system parameters .",
    "in such cases , typically , too many different frequencies can contribute to the signal , making the ansatz inappropriate .",
    "to see the special form of time - series generated by the prediction , we introduce vectors @xmath63^{\\intercal}$ ] such that takes the form @xmath64 with @xmath65 prediction therefore corresponds to applying powers of @xmath66 to the initial vector @xmath67",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath68 encode the physical resonance frequencies and dampings .",
    "the connection is given as @xmath71 .",
    "excluding exponentially growing terms as unphysical , all @xmath68 should obey @xmath72 .",
    "in numerical practice , eigenvalues @xmath73 may occur , and various remedies exist , all based on the assumption that the corresponding @xmath70 are small .",
    "common manipulations of occurring @xmath74 are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "we tested all three and settled on the last option .",
    "when linear prediction is applicable , the choice should not matter ( see discussion at the end of sec .  [",
    "sec : xxmodel ] ) .    from the study of several examples",
    ", we found that the error of the linear prediction is roughly a function of @xmath78 , i.e.  @xmath40 should be adapted to the choice of the time step @xmath79 in the dmrg time evolution . in the simulations",
    ", @xmath80 was chosen as a compromise between a large @xmath40 to allow for a superposition of as many different oscillations as possible and a small @xmath40 to have good statistics for the fit of the coefficients @xmath42 .    at @xmath29 ,",
    "critical one - dimensional systems exhibit power - law decays in their time - dependent correlators .",
    "the superposition of exponential decays is then taken to mimic these power - laws @xcite . at finite temperatures ,",
    "time - dependent correlators @xmath81 decay typically exponentially for large times ( due to thermal broadening ) , making linear prediction especially well - suited for this situation .",
    "the hamiltonian of the _ xx _ model reads @xmath82 where we choose the critical field @xmath83 .",
    "we consider the observable @xmath84\\rangle_\\beta$ ] , which is the spectral function of the corresponding model of hardcore bosons .",
    "this allows for a detailed analysis of the method , as correlators for this model can be calculated numerically exactly by the evaluation of pfaffian determinants @xcite .",
    "the dmrg simulation employed a fourth - order trotter - suzuki decomposition and a time step @xmath85 .",

    "the finite temperature causes a finite correlation length in the @xmath89 state . during time evolution ,",
    "correlations are built up further only inside causal cones .",
    "hence for small enough @xmath90 and @xmath0 , finite - size effects are negligible if measurements are restricted to the middle of the system . ] to demonstrate the potential of the prediction method , the calculations was stopped at times @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 ( which can be reached with very moderate computational resources corresponding to dmrg block hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath95 ) .",
    "for the linear prediction , we used @xmath96 for @xmath92 and @xmath97 for @xmath94 .",

    "[ fig : lineshapes ] shows , for both temperatures , lineshapes can be calculated very accurately upon fourier transformation of the predicted data , allowing for precise experimental analysis .",
    "in contrast , even upon windowing ( here done by a parzen filter ) , the raw data provide completely wrong line maxima and widths .",
    "almost the whole spectral function is reproduced very exactly .",
    "the sole exception occurs for values of @xmath99 very close to zero and @xmath100 : here , the group velocity vanishes , @xmath101 , leading to a very slow decay of correlators which is not captured perfectly for the chosen temperatures and maximum simulation times @xmath35 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : linpred ] , we gave already arguments for the parameter choice @xmath51 and @xmath80 for the prediction method .",
    "there is one further parameter involved : for the determination of prediction coefficients @xmath42 in , the autocorrelation matrix @xmath55 has to be inverted , , and requires some regularization . to this purpose",
    ", one may either add a small regularization constant before the inversion @xmath102 , or project out the eigenspaces with eigenvalues below @xmath103 i.e.  @xmath104 ( pseudo inverse ) .    in cases where the linear prediction method is not appropriate , or the @xmath35 achievable with @xmath0-dmrg",
