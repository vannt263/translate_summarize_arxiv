    "the study of energy transfer mechanisms at the nanoscale  volz , greffet3 has aroused increasing interest due to the emergence of the interdisciplinary field of nanoscience where such wide - ranging fields as for example solid state physics  @xcite , nanothermodynamics  rubi , rubi2,hill or electrical engineering  @xcite coexist .",
    "one of the basic problems in this field is to determine the energy exchange between two nanoparticles ( nps ) at different temperatures .",
    "the way in which this energy is transfered depends crucially on the distance between the particles . for sufficiently large distances , heat exchange proceeds via thermal radiation , through emission or absorption of photons whereas at smaller distances recent molecular dynamics simulations have shown that coulomb interaction ( near - field radiation ) is the dominant mechanism  greffet .    for near - field interactions ,",
    "the thermal conductance was calculated under the assumption that both nps behave as effective dipoles at different temperatures  @xcite .",
    "hence , since these dipoles undergo thermal fluctuations , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt )  kubo , callen , landau , groot provides the energy which dissipates into heat in each np .",
    "it was found that the heat and therefore the conductance varies according to @xmath0 a very different behavior from the one observed in the case of thermal radiation : @xmath1 .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations agree with the dipole - dipole model when the two nps are separated by a distance on the order of a few nanometers .",
    "however , near contact the conductance deviates dramatically from the prediction of the dipole model , as the simulations show .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of * *  * * the fact that when particles become very close the position of the atoms are highly correlated , consequently the charge distributions * *  * * become nonsymmetric and can not be described merely as two interacting dipoles . to account for this distortion of the distribution of charges a more general formalism which focuses more convoluted interactions involving higher order multipoles aside from the dipoles",
    "is required .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to provide this general formalism enabling us to analyze the behavior of the conductance beyond the dipolar approximation .",
    "we will use the linear response theory to derive an expression of the fdt for the fluctuations of the higher order multipoles .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the quadrupolar contributions to the conductance which are able to reproduce the behavior observed in the simulations for some sizes of the nps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the multipolar expansion of the coulomb forces  @xcite between both nps and derive a general expression of the fdt valid for multipoles of any order which leads to the heat transfer between the nps . in section 3 , we analyze the particular case of quadrupolar contributions and derive the expresion of the conductance .",
    "we compare our result with the molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we emphasize our main conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will study the near - filed radiative heat transfer flux between two nps which interact through coulomb forces .      to analyze the coulomb interaction between two nps ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_nps ] ) it is necessary to know the charge distribution inside each of them .",
    "this can be performed by specifying their multipole moments so that the multipole moment of order @xmath2 of the np@xmath3 , @xmath4 , can be defined as  @xcite @xmath5where @xmath6 is the charge at the position @xmath7 inside the np and the @xmath8 are symmetric irreducible tensors ( see the appendix i for more details ) where @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the case @xmath12 corresponds to the monopole @xmath13 , @xmath14 is related to the dipole moment @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for the quadrupole moment @xmath17 .",
    "hence , in terms of the spherical surface tensors @xmath18 , given through eq .",
    "( [ surf_tens ] ) , and the unit vector @xmath19 related to @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( [ multipole ] ) adopts the equivalent form @xmath20     and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "each np is assimilated to a multipole moment ( moments @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , and are separated by a distance @xmath24 between their centers . ]",
    "the above mentioned interaction between these nps modifies their respective hamiltonians .",
    "the interaction between np@xmath3 with np@xmath25 introduces a time - dependent perturbation @xmath26 in its hamiltonian which can be written as a multipolar expansion  @xcite : @xmath27with @xmath28 and @xmath29 stands for the full contraction of indexes , @xmath30 .",
    "in addition @xmath31with @xmath32 being the interaction potential between both nps and @xmath24 the separation between their centers . in terms of the first contributions ,",
    "the perturbation can be expressed as @xmath33where @xmath34 is the electric field induced in the np@xmath3 , @xmath35 is the gradient of this induced field , and @xmath36 is the conjugated quadrupolar moment .    likewise , the electrostatic potential admits a multipolar expansion as well @xmath37 which expresses the fact that the potential acting on the np@xmath3 depends on the charge distribution in the np@xmath25 .",
    "here , @xmath38 are the multipolar moments of the np@xmath25 and @xmath39 is the green propagator , with @xmath40 the vector connection the centers of the particles and @xmath41 the corresponding unit vector .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ multipolar_potential ] ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is defined through @xmath44      in the linear response regime , the multipolar moments can be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the multipolar polarizabilities which may in general depend on frequency .",
    "the energy transferred between the particles and converted into heat can be obtained from the linear response theory  @xcite .",
    "one obtains ( see the appendix ii ) @xmath47where the symbol @xmath48 stands for the complex conjugated , and the brakets express thermal average .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ multipol_rela ] ) , the term in eq .",

    "( [ green ] ) and ( green3 ) .",
    "the multipole - multipole correlation can be obtained by using the fdt  @xcite @xmath54where @xmath55 is the mean energy of an oscillator . as an illustration , for the dipolar case  @xcite , we obtain @xmath56where @xmath57 is the dipole - dipole polarizability which we assume to be given through @xmath58and @xmath59 , with @xmath60 . hence , eq .

    "( [ fd_qua ] ) is written as @xmath67up to the quadrupolar order one has to take into account also the cross correlation dipole - quadrupole @xmath68where @xmath69 is the dipole - quadrupole polarizability , given through @xmath70with @xmath71 and @xmath72an isotropic skew - symmetric tensor . from eqs.([dip_qua])-([axial ] ) it follows @xmath73    it must be emphasize that the fdt , eq .",
    "( [ fd ] ) , applies whenever the charge distribution of each particle in the presence of mutual interactions has reached equilibrium with the heat bath .",
    "when this is not the case , in the non - aged regime  @xcite , one can still use a similar expression of the fdt in terms of an effective temperature .",
    "this can be done through a generalized langevin equation  @xcite , which takes into account the heat exchange between the np@xmath3 and its thermal bath .",
    "relating the momentum variance of the np@xmath3 with its temperature by the equipartition theorem , one can obtain the effective temperature ( @xmath74 ) through the response of the system due to fluctuations of the multipolar moments  @xcite .",

    "this expression shows that when the multipole moments of the particles are uncorrelated , _",
    "i.e. _ when both particles equilibrate independently at two different temperatures , the effective temperature coincides with that of the bath .",
    "this is the situation addressed in this paper .",
    "the effective temperature , defined as that for which the system would equilibrate , is a parameter measuring the distance to the stationary state in which both particles reach two different temperatures .",
    "it can be also calculated using a relaxation model  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the thermal conductance between the two nps in the presence of quadrupolar contributions . to this end , we start by writing eq .",
    "( [ energy_2 ] ) as follows @xmath78 where from eqs .",

    "( [ kernel_1 ] ) and the resulting equation into eq .",
    "( [ energy_3 ] ) we obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ energy_4 ] ) we obtain the net heat flux between both nps @xmath83    in view of eq .",
    "( [ axial ] ) and the symmetric character of the spherical surface tensors given through eq .",
    "( [ surf_tens ] ) one can prove from  eq .",

    "hence , up to quadrupolar order we can write from eq .",

    "in this situation , the results corresponding to the grey dotted lines show the behavior @xmath0 which was obtained in ref .",
    "our results are in broad agreement for this region where the dipolar domain is present .",
    "when the particles are close togheter , their charge distributions becomes very disorderly and higher orders than dipolar interactions come into play in the calculation of the thermal conductance . in this case , as predicted by domingues et al .",

    "in this paper , we have presented a theory to explain the exchange of energy between two nps at different temperature .",
    "our theory provides a general formalism based on the multipolar expansion of the electrostatic field in order to study heat transfer between two nps for arbitrary small distances provided that the fdt be satisfied .",
    "however , out of the fdt regime and when the system possesses fast and slow degrees of freedom it is possible to formulate a fdt in terms of a non stationary effective temperature which depends on the slow degrees of freedom  @xcite .    we have found that our analysis of the heat interchanged between two nps separated by a few submicrons agrees with the explains the rapid growth of the conductance observed in the simulation  @xcite , even when the nps are in contact .",
    "hence , we are able to provide a comprehensive explanation of the numerical results reported in ref .  @xcite .    the formalism presented could also be applied to other situations such as the radiative heat transfer between a small dielectric particle and a surface  @xcite and the study of the optical forces due the radiation of a thermal source  @xcite , enabling us to go beyond the dipolar approximation .",
