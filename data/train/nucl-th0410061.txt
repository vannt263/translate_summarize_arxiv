    "real compton scattering ( rcs ) , @xmath1 , has a long history of providing important theoretical and experimental tests for models of nucleon structure ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite for an introduction ) . based on the requirement of gauge invariance , lorentz invariance",
    ", crossing symmetry , and the discrete symmetries , the famous low - energy theorem of low @xcite and gell - mann and goldberger @xcite uniquely specifies the terms in the low - energy scattering amplitude up to and including terms linear in the photon momentum .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion are expressed in terms of global properties of the nucleon : its mass , charge , and magnetic moment . in principle , any model respecting the symmetries entering the derivation of the let should reproduce the constraints of the let .",
    "it is only terms of second order which contain new information on the structure of the nucleon specific to compton scattering . for a general target",
    ", these effects can be parameterized in terms of two constants , the electric and magnetic polarizabilities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude may be parameterized in terms of six independent functions @xmath4 depending on the photon energy @xmath5 and the scattering angle , @xmath6 in the forward and backward directions only two functions , namely , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , contribute .",
    "for example , the taylor series expansion of @xmath7 , for the proton , is given by @xmath9\\ , \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 .",
    "the leading - order term is given by the thomson term and the forward and backward amplitudes are sensitive to the combinations @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the sum of the polarizabilities is constrained by the baldin sum rule @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total photoabsorption cross section .",
    "a fit to all modern low - energy experiments @xcite and the sum rule relation @xmath15 and @xmath3 are given in units of @xmath16 .",
    "] leads to the result @xcite @xmath17 clearly , the electric polarizability @xmath18 dominates over the small magnetic polarizability @xmath19 , the smallness of which is thought to result from a delicate cancellation between the paramagnetic @xmath20 contribution and a nearly equally strong diamagnetic term .",
    "although , for example , soliton models of the nucleon have predicted such a destructive interference for a long time @xcite , the precise microscopic origin of the relatively large diamagnetic contribution is still under debate .",
    "information on the neutron has been obtained via low - energy neutron-@xmath21pb scattering @xcite , @xmath22 quasi - free compton scattering @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 and elastic @xmath25 scattering @xcite @xmath26 a recent re - analysis of the sum rule yields @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "new extractions using effective field theory for the nucleon as well as the deuteron have yielded for the proton polarizabilities at @xmath28 in chiral perturbation theory @xcite @xmath29 and for the isoscalar nucleon polarizabilities @xmath30 and a @xmath31 that is consistent with zero within sizeable error bars .",
    "another calculation including explicit @xmath20 degrees of freedom obtained @xcite @xmath32 for a recent review on the status of the spin polarizabilities , see ref .",
    "as in all studies with electromagnetic probes , the possibilities to investigate the structure of the target are much greater if virtual photons are used , since the energy and the three - momentum of the virtual photon can be varied independently . moreover , the longitudinal component of current operators entering the amplitude can be studied .",
    "the amplitude for virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) off the proton , @xmath33 , is accessible in the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "( [ trcs ] ) , @xmath33 can be expressed in terms of eight transverse and four longitudinal amplitudes .",
    "model - independent predictions , based on lorentz invariance , gauge invariance , crossing symmetry , and the discrete symmetries , have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . up to and including terms of second order in the momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 , all functions",
    "@xmath4 are completely specified in terms of quantities which can be obtained from elastic electron - proton scattering and rcs , namely @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . after dividing the amplitude @xmath33 into a gauge - invariant generalized pole piece @xmath41 and a residual piece @xmath42 , the so - called generalized polarizabilities ( gps ) of ref .",
    "@xcite result from an analysis of the residual piece in terms of electromagnetic multipoles .",
    "a restriction to the lowest - order , _",
    "i.e. _ linear terms in @xmath43 leads to only electric and magnetic dipole radiation in the final state .",
    "parity and angular - momentum selection rules , charge - conjugation symmetry , and particle crossing generate six independent gps @xcite",
    ".    similarly as elastic electron scattering allows one to map out the spatial distribution of charge and magnetization inside the nucleon , the generalized polarizabilities parameterize a _ local _ response of a system in an external field .",
    "for example , if the nucleon is exposed to a static and uniform external electric field @xmath44 , an electric polarization @xmath45 is generated which is related to the _ density _ of the induced electric dipole moments , @xmath46 the tensor @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _  the density of the full electric polarizability of the system , can be expressed as @xcite @xmath48\\,r'^2\\,dr',\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fourier transforms of the generalized longitudinal and transverse electric polarizabilities @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . the definition of the generalized dipole polarizabilities of ref .",
    "@xcite has been obtained from a fully covariant framework as opposed to the multipole decomposition of ref .",
    "in particular , it is important to realize that both longitudinal and transverse polarizabilities are needed to fully recover the electric polarization @xmath45 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_gps ] shows the induced polarization inside a nucleon as calculated in the framework of heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory at @xmath53 @xcite and clearly shows that the polarization , in general , does not point into the direction of the applied electric field .",
    "similar considerations apply to an external magnetic field . since the magnetic induction is always transverse ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , it is sufficient to consider @xmath55 @xcite",
    ". then the magnetization @xmath56 induced by the uniform external magnetic field is given in terms of the density of the magnetic polarizability as @xmath57 ( see right panel of fig .",
