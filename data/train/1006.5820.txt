    "then it was improved by milekhin @xcite , and a covariant simple model was given by cooper and frye @xcite .",
    "in all these models the fo happened when the fluid crossed a hypersurface in the spacetime .    at early relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the initial compression and thermal excitation was described by a compression shock in nuclear matter .",
    "this was already pointed out by the first publications of w. greiner and e. teller and their colleagues @xcite , and the shock took place crossing a spacetime hypersurface ( e.g. a relatively thin layer resulting in a mach cone ) .",

    "later csernai @xcite pointed out the importance of satisfying energy , momentum and particle charge conservation laws across such hypersurfaces and generalized the earlier description of taub @xcite to spacelike and timelike hypersurfaces ( with spacelike and timelike normals respectively ) .",
    "in this situation the matter both before and after the shock was near to thermal equilibrium , and thus the conservation laws led to scalar equations connecting thermodynamical parameters of the two stages of the matter : the generalized _ rayleigh line _ and _ taub adiabat _",

    "other models were needed to handle the initial development , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . the initial non - equilibrium state in this situation can not be characterized by thermodynamical parameters or an eos , so the previous approach , with the generalized _ rayleigh line _ and _ taub adiabat _ is not applicable . nevertheless , the intermediate ( fluid dynamical ) stage is in equilibrium and has an eos , while the initial state has a well defined energy momentum tensor . in this work",
    "we will demonstrate that the final invariant scalar , thermodynamical parameters can be determined in this situation also from the conservation laws .",
    "then , bugaev @xcite observed that fo across hypersurfaces with spacelike normals , has problems with negative contributions in the cooper - frye evaluation @xcite of particle spectra , thus the fo must yield an anisotropic distribution , which he could approximate with a cut - jttner distribution @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising as in the rest frame of the front ( rff ) all post fo particles must move `` outwards '' , i.e. @xmath25 is required .",
    "this condition is not satisfied by any non - interacting thermal equilibrium distribution , which extend to infinity in all directions even if they are boosted in the rff .",
    "subsequently , another analytic form was proposed by csernai and tamosiunas , the cancelling - jttner distribution @xcite , which replaced the sharp cutoff by a continuous cutoff , based on kinetic model results .",
    "parallel to this development , the fo process was analysed in kinetic , transport approaches @xcite , where the fo happened in an outer layer of the spacetime , or in principle it could be extended to the whole fluid ( although , at early moments of a collision / explosion , from the center of the reaction few particles can escape ) .",
    "these transport studies also indicated that the post fo distributions may become anisotropic @xcite even for fo hypersurfaces with timelike normal [ in short : _ timelike surface _ ] , if the normal , @xmath26 , and the velocity four - vector , @xmath27 , are ( very ) different",
    ".    these studies led to another fo description , where the initial stages of the collision with strongly interacting matter were described by fluid dynamics , while the final , outer spacetime domain ( or later times ) was described by weakly interacting particle ( and string ) transport models , where the final fo was inherently included , as each particle was tracked , until its last interaction .",
    "it is important to mention , that in these approaches , the transition from the fd stage to the molecular dynamics ( md ) or cascade stage happens when the matter crosses a spacetime hypersurface , thus the conservations laws @xcite have to be satisfied and the post fo particle phase space distributions @xcite have to be used when the post fo distributions become anisotropic .    in this work for the first time we present a simple covariant solution for the transition problem and conservation laws for the situations when the matter after the front is in thermal equilibrium ( i.e. it has isotropic phase space distribution ) and has an eos , but the matter before the front must not be in an equilibrium state .",
    "then we discuss the situation where microscopic models are appended to the fluid dynamical model , which are in , or close to thermal equilibrium , but the eos , is not necessarily known .",
    "subsequently , we present the way to generalize the problem to anisotropic matter in final state , which is necessary for fo across spacelike surfaces and also for timelike surfaces if the flow velocity is large in the rest frame of the front ( rff ) .",
    "this problem was solved in kinetic approach for the bugaev cut - jttner approach @xcite and the csernai - tamosiunas cancelling - jttner approach , @xcite by calculating the energy momentum tensors explicitly from the anisotropic phase space distributions , but no general solution is given for post fo matter with anisotropic pressure tensor .",
    "the transition hypersurface between two stages of a dynamical development are most frequently postulated , governed by the requirement of simplicity .",
    "thus , such a hypersurface is frequently chosen as a fixed coordinate time in a descartian frame @xmath28 , or at a fixed proper time @xmath29 from a spacetime point , although in a general 3 + 1 dimensional system the choice of such a point is not uniquely defined .",
    "it is important that the _ transition hypersurface should be continuous _ , ( without holes where conserved particles or energy or momentum could escape through , without being accounted for ) . to secure that one quantity ( e.g. baryon charge ) does not escape through the holes of a hypersurface",
    "is not sufficient , as other quantities may ( e.g. momentum in case if @xmath30 is different on the two sides of a hole ) .",
    "again , to construct such a continuous hypersurface in a general 3 + 1 dimensional system is a rather complex task , although , in 1 + 1 or 2 + 1 dimensions it seems to be easy .",
    "both the initial state models and the intermediate stage , fluid dynamical models may be such that the calculation could be continued beyond the point where a transition takes place . then spacetime location of the transition to the next stage can or should be decided , based on a physical condition or requirement , which may be external to the development itself . as a consequence , in some cases the determination of transition surface may be an iterative process .    numerically , the extraction of a freeze out ( fo ) hypersurface is by no means trivial .",
    "one of us , brs , has recently provided a proper numerical treatment regarding the extraction of fo hypersurfaces in two ( 2d ) , three ( 3d ) and four ( 4d ) dimensions  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in 2d the history , i.e. , the temporal evolution , of a temperature field of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) relativistic fluid can be represented by a gray - level image ( _ cf .",
    "_ , fig .  1 ) . in the figure",
    ", we use the time @xmath28 and the radius @xmath31 for the temporal and the spatial dimensions , respectively .",
    "let bright pixels ( i.e. , picture elements ) refer to high temperatures and dark ones to low temperatures of the fluid .",
    "in this example , a 2d freeze - out hypersurface is an iso - therme .    in fig .  1.a , we also depict the corresponding co - variant normal vectors @xmath32 . in 2d",
    ", the length of each normal vector is equal to the length of each supporting iso - contour vector .",
    "each normal vector has its origin at the contra - variant center , @xmath33 , of a given contra - variant iso - contour vector and points to the exterior of the enclosed spacetime region .",
    "the latter is also indicated in fig .",
    "1.b , where we show that a contra - variant normal vector @xmath34 can be obtained by reflection of the co - variant normal vector @xmath32 at the time axis ( dashed line ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "1.c we show the contra - variant fo contour vectors with their corresponding contra - variant normal vectors @xmath34 .",
    "not all of these contra - variant normal vectors point to the exterior of the enclosed spacetime region .",
    "note that the sign conventions of the normals of the transition hypersurface are important , and must be discussed , especially if both timelike and spacelike surfaces are studied . in fact , only the timelike contra - variant normal vectors point outwards , whereas the spacelike contra - variant normal vectors point inwards @xcite .",
    "if we know the fo hypersurface and the local momentum distribution after the transition the total , measurable momentum distribution can be evaluated by the cooper - frye formula @xcite .",
    "let us define the contra - variant and co - variant surface normal four - vectors as @xmath35 where in general @xmath36 , as the surface element can be either spacelike ( - ) or timelike ( + ) .",
    "we can also introduce a unit normal to the surface as : @xmath37 so that @xmath38 furthermore @xmath39 where for timelike surfaces @xmath40 and for spacelike surfaces @xmath41 . for the frequently used timelike , one - dimensional case @xmath42 .    in the general case",
    "the conserved energy - momentum current crossing the surface element is @xmath43 @xmath44 must be continuous across the freeze - out surface , as must the baryon current @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the invariant scalar baryon charge current .",
    "we assume that the initial state , `` @xmath48 '' , and its energy momentum tensor and baryon current before the front is known .",
    "we aim for the characteristics of the final state . in total",
    "there are six unknowns in the equilibrated final state , these are @xmath23 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 ( here we drop the index `` @xmath49 '' for the final state for shorter notation ) , however the pressure @xmath6 , a function of @xmath5 and @xmath8 , is given by the eos , @xmath22 .",
    "knowing @xmath8 and @xmath5 , the eos , and the particular form of the corresponding equilibrated distribution function , the parameters @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , can also be obtained .",
    "thus , we have to solve 5 equations : @xmath52 the l.h.s .",

    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) was not used up to this point , thus we can use there results both for the baryon - free and baryon - rich case .",
    "we can have an elegant direct solution for the proper energy density , @xmath5 , and pressure , @xmath6 , as both of these quantities are invariant scalars , and we can express these by the covariant , 4-vector equation ( [ em - curr ] ) . from this 4-vector equation",
    "we can get two invariant scalar equations by ( i ) taking its norm , @xmath64 , and ( ii ) taking its projection to the normal direction , @xmath65 : @xmath66 now expressing @xmath67 from eq .",
    "( [ ads ] ) and inserting it to eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) , we obtain our final equation @xmath68 which can be solved straightforwardly if the eos , @xmath69 , is known .",
    "the other three elements of the equation , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath70 , are known from the normal to the surface and from energy - momentum current from the pre - transition side .",
    "then , eqs .",
    "( [ eqg2a]-[eqg2b ] ) can be used to determine the final flow velocity . at the end , after all conservation law equations are solved , we have to check the non - decreasing entropy condition ( [ entropy ] ) to see whether the solution is physically possible . if the overall entropy is decreasing after transition that would mean that the hypersurface is chosen incorrectly .",
    "one will need to choose more realistic condition for the transition and repeat the calculations .",
    "this result can be used both if the initial state is in equilibrium and if it is not .      in case of an ideal gas of massless particles after the front , with an eos of @xmath71 , eq .",
    "( [ aa2 ] ) leads to a quadratic equation , @xmath72 where @xmath73 , is the energy momentum transfer 4-vector across a unit hypersurface element .",
    "if the flow velocity is normal to the fo hypersurface , @xmath74 , then for an initial perfect fluid in the local rest ( lr ) frame the above covariant equation takes a simple form , @xmath75 this has two real roots , @xmath76 ( energy density is conserved ) and @xmath77 which does not correspond to a physical solution , as the energy density should not be negative .",
    "if the eos depends on the conserved baryon charge density also , then we must exploit in addition eq .",
    "( [ eqn ] ) : @xmath78 and inserting @xmath79 from here to eq .",
    "( [ ads ] ) yields @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the generalized specific volume , well known from relativistic shock and detonation theory  @xcite .",

    "( [ aa2 ] ) and the eos , @xmath22 , provide three equations to be solved for @xmath84 and @xmath8 .",
    "this evaluation of the post fo configuration is in agreement with the theory of relativistic shocks and detonations  @xcite allowing for both spacelike and timelike fo hypersurfaces .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "this method of evaluation observables is frequently used at the end of fluid dynamical model calculations ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "recently a frequently practiced method to describe the final stages of a reaction is to switch the fd model over to a molecular dynamics ( md ) description at a transition hypersurface .",
    "this is frequently a fixed time , @xmath28 , or fixed proper time , @xmath29 hypersurface .",
    "the generation of the initial state of such an md model is a task , which depends on the constituents of the matter described by the md model .",
    "nevertheless , same principles must be satisfied , like the conservation laws , eqs.([nconserve]-[tconserve ] ) .",
    "let us assume , although not required by physical laws , that we have thermal equilibrium on both sides of the transition and we know explicitly the corresponding final momentum distribution of particles .",
    "then , the fundamental equation to construct the post transition microscopic state , in addition to the conservation laws is the cooper - frye formula , @xmath85 assuming that the local phase space distribution , @xmath86 , is known for all initial components of the md model . if @xmath86 are local equilibrium distributions then ( in principle ) we know the intensive and extensive thermodynamical parameters and the eos of the matter when the md model simulation starts",
    ". these must not be the same as the ones before the transition hypersurface .    in the usual transition from fd to md models ,",
    "where the initial state of md is in equilibrium , the eos - s are known on both sides of the transition surface , and thus , both the equations of rayleigh - line and taub - adiabat , eqs .",
    "( [ rayligh - taub ] ) , as well as the invariant scalar equations derived here , eqs.([aa],[ads],[aa2],[ep2nd ] ) can be used to determine all parameters of the matter starting the md simulation .",
    "these then determine the phase space distributions , @xmath86 of all components of the md simulation .",
    "subsequently eq.([cf - f ] ) can be used to generate randomly the initial constituents of the md simulation .    as eq.([cf - f ] ) is a covariant equation applicable in any frame of reference , the most straightforward is to perform the generation of particles in the calculational frame of the md model .",
    "this transition is by now performed in many hybrid models combining fluid dynamics with microscopic transport models @xcite .",
    "these models at present are the most effective to describe experimental data and make the need for a modified boltzmann transport equation @xcite less problematic .    in some cases the first step of the transition , the determination of the parameters of the final state from the exact conservation laws , is dropped with the argument that both before and after the transition the matter has the same constituents and the same eos , thus the all extensive and intensive thermodynamical parameters as well as the flow velocity must remain the same .",
    "then , using the intensive parameters the final particle distributions in the cooper - frye formula , eq.([cf - f ] ) , can be directly evaluated in a straightforward way .",
    "this procedure is correct , but only if all features of the two states of the matter and their eos are identical . in some cases the pre transition eos assumes effective hadron masses depending on the matter density , while the final eos is that of a hadron ideal gas mixture , but with fixed vacuum masses .",
    "this leads to a difference in the eos , thus the above procedure is approximate . in such cases ,",
    "the method can be used , but the accurate conservation laws can be enforced by a final adjustment step described in the next subsection .    the situation is similar if the constituents and the eos are almost identical before and after the transition , but before the transition a weak or weakening mean field potential or compression energy is taken into account .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned approximate methods , even for really identical eos - s across the transition or with generating the final eos parameter based on conservation laws for the final eos , inaccuracies may arise due to other reasons : during the random generation of the initial constituent particles of the md simulation , the exact conservation laws may be violated , due to finite number effects . however , the energy and particle number conservations are usually enforced during the random generation of particles , even if the above procedure of solving the conservation laws beforehand is not fully followed .",
    "this is usually the consequence of the fact that the eos of the md model is not necessarily known if the model has complex constituents and laws of motion .    in any case to remedy this random error and make the conservation laws exactly satisfied a final correction step is advisable , and it is not always performed .",
    "if the energy and particle number conservations are enforced then , the last variable to balance is the momentum conservation .",
    "this regulates the flow velocity of the matter after the transition initiating the md simulation .",
    "the energy momentum tensor and baryon current for the generated random set of particle species , \" @xmath87 , for each fluid cell ( or group of cells if the multiplicity in a single cell is too low ) can be calculated from the kinetic definition : @xmath88 which , yield the resulting momentum and flow velocity of the matter .",
    "this can be used to adjust the flow velocity to achieve exact conservation of momentum , and modify the velocity of generated particles by the required lorentz boost .",
    "the other conserved quantities may then be affected also , but an iterative procedure to eliminate the error completely is not crucial as the error can be given quantitatively .",
    "if the randomly generated state is not following a thermal equilibrium phase space distribution , @xmath89 , and thus does not have an eos , the above described scalar equations can not be used to generate the initial configuration of the md model .",
    "nevertheless , the second step to check the conservation laws with the kinetic definition , and then correct the parameters of the generated particles can be done . for a required level of accuracy in this case an iterative procedure",
    "may be necessary .",
    "another , easier way to remedy this problem is to choose the transition hypersurface earlier so that the subsequent matter is still in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this can always be done if the requirement of entropy increase is satisfied .",
    "we have mentioned that the assumption for having thermal equilibrium in the final state is neither excluded nor required from transport theoretical considerations .",
    "however , thermal equilibrium distribution is not possible if we have to describe fo across a spacelike hypersurface ( see the discussion in section [ intro ] . )    in the md model description the final post fo momentum distributions develope a local anisotropy if the fo has locally a preferred direction . unless the unit normal of the fo hypersurface is equal to the local flow velocity of the pre fo matter , there is always a selected spatial direction which is the dominant direction of fo",
    "this situation is discussed in several theoretical works , and some general features can be extracted from these studies .      in explicit transport models this situation",
    "is handled @xcite : starting from an equilibrium jttner distribution and considering a momentum dependent escape probability in the collision term , - which reflected the direction of the fo front and the distance from the front , - an anisotropic distribution was obtained ( i.e. a distribution , which was anisotropic even in its own lr frame ) .",
    "this anisotropic distribution could be approximated with analytic distribution functions @xcite : the starting point is the un - cut , isotropic , jttner distribution in the rest frame of the gas ( rfg ) , which is centered around the 4-velocity vector , @xmath90 .",

    "interestingly , a simplified numerical kinetic fo model @xcite led to a fo distribution satisfying the condition @xmath25 for spacelike fo with a smooth distribution function , which is anisotropic ( also in its own lr frame ) and has a symmetry axis pointing in the dominant fo direction .",

    "when the adjustable parameters of the post fo matter are determined in this way from the conservation laws , we still need the underlying anisotropic momentum distribution of the emitted particles in order to evaluate the final particle spectra using the cooper - frye formula with this anisotropic distribution function . once again",
    ", when all conservation law equations are solved we have to check the non - decreasing entropy condition to see whether the selected fo hypersurface is realistic .    in case of an anisotropic final state , due to the increased number of parameters and their more involved relations , the covariant treatment of the problem may not provide a simplification , compared to the direct solution of conservation laws for each component of the energy momentum tensor ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent viscous fluid dynamical calculations evaluate the anisotropy of the momentum distribution is in the pre fo viscous flow ( see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "this anisotropy is governed by the spacetime direction of the viscous transport .",
    "the pre and post fo matter may still be different , e.g. the pre fo state may be viscous qgp with current quarks and perturbative vacuum , while post fo we may have a hadron gas or constituent quark gas .",
    "the final state will also be anisotropic , not only because of the initial anisotropy but also due to freeze - out .",
    "the two physical processes leading to anisotropy are independent , so their dominant directions are in general different . in this case",
    "the general symmetries are uncorrelated and can not be exploited to simplify the description of the transition . due to the change of the matter properties , the conservation laws , eqs .",
    "( [ nconserve]-[entropy ] ) , are needed to determine the parameters of the post fo matter before the cooper - frye formula with non - equilibrium post fo distribution is applied to evaluate observables .",
    "in this work a new simple covariant treatment is presented for solving the conservation laws across a transition hypersurface .",
    "this leads to a significant simplification of the calculation if both the initial and final states are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the same method can also be used for the more complicated anisotropic final state , however , this method is only advantageous if the more involved relations among the parameters of the post fo distribution and the distribution itself is given in covariant form , preferably through invariant scalars .",

    "<S> heavy ion reactions and other collective dynamical processes are frequently described by different theoretical approaches for the different stages of the process , like initial equilibration stage , intermediate locally equilibrated fluid dynamical stage and final freeze - out stage . for the last stage the best known is the cooper - frye description </S>",
