    "far away from initial and boundary conditions , dynamical evolution of a fluid may lead to self - similar phases with variable profiles shape - invariant and magnitudes properly scaled ( sedov 1959 ) . for star formation , self - similar solutions were found to describe collapses of isothermal gas clouds ( larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ; shu 1977 , hereafter s77 ) . from an initial time @xmath3 when the core becomes singular to the final stage @xmath4 , shu ( 1977 ) derived the ` expansion - wave collapse solution ' ( ewcs ) that has a free - fall core of density @xmath5 , a radial infall speed @xmath6 , a constant mass accretion rate at @xmath7 and a static envelope of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with the stagnation point moving outward at the sound speed @xmath8 .",

    "gas flows at large @xmath1 together with the two distinct asymptotic behaviors near the origin give rise to infinitely many similarity solutions .",
    "those solutions of ` envelope expansion with core collapse ' ( eecc ) are especially interesting .",
    "besides these shock - free solutions , tsai & hsu ( 1995 , hereafter th95 ) constructed a shocked self - similar collapse solution for a situation where a central energy release initiates an outgoing shock during a protostellar collapse of a low - mass star .",

    "the core mass accretion rate can be extremely low for the latter",
    "regarding the ewcs scenario for star formation ( shu et al . 1987 ) , th95 argued that a central energy output during a protostellar collapse can initiate a shock into a sis envelope with a lower core mass accretion rate .",

    "we now turn to the well - observed protostellar cloud b335 that possesses a collapsing core .    besides the observed bipolar co outflows on large scales ,",

    "in essence , a gross spherical symmetry is assumed for b335 cloud by regarding the bipolar outflows as additional features produced by a circumstellar disk within @xmath66 au ( harvey et al .",

    "1995 ; velusamy et al .",
    "1995 ) , departures from the ewcs model exist . in sa99 , the estimated infall speed at @xmath68 au",
    "is @xmath69 km s@xmath65 for @xmath70 au , smaller than the ewcs prediction of @xmath71 km s@xmath65 by a factor of @xmath72 , and the estimated mass accretion rate is @xmath73 yr@xmath65 , corresponding to @xmath74 that tends to be less than the ewcs prediction @xmath61 ( z93 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the column density of the outer envelope at @xmath75 au is @xmath76@xmath77 , slightly larger than the ewcs prediction @xmath78 @xmath77 ( sa99 ) .",

    "( 2001 ) that gives an envelope density @xmath79 times higher than ewcs prediction while the density @xmath17 scales as @xmath80 .",
    "hcn spectral analysis of b335 seems to indicate a central core collapse with an envelope expansion distinctly different from bipolar co outflows .",
    "the major advantage of our shocked similarity flow model is the capability of accommodating observations of b335 globule while making testable predictions for envelope expansion in contrast to a sis of the ewcs .",
    "as an example , we introduce the unshocked cp1 eecc solution ( dashed curves in fig .",
    "1 ) that analytically passes the sonic critical line twice ( ls04 ) .",

    "the density approaches @xmath87 with @xmath88 ( table 3 of ls04 ) .",
    "that is , our cp1 eecc model gives an envelope density @xmath89 times higher than that of a sis in the ewcs ( i.e. @xmath90 ) .",

    "this is qualitatively consistent with the preliminary hcn spectral analysis ( a. lapinov 2004 , private communications ) . by inserting a shock at a proper location",
    ", it has a range to adjust the data fit for density and speed profiles and there is a preliminary evidence of shock in b335 system ( e.g. , nisini et al .",
    "1999 ) . sharing the qualitative features of the ewcs in the central region , our class i solutions ( including cp1 eecc solution ) of shocked similarity flows are versatile to model other protostellar cloud or bok globule systems .",
    "as massive ob stars form in molecular clouds , intense ultraviolet radiations ionize surrounding h i clouds and carve out h ii regions ( strmgren 1939 ) .",
    "as an ionization front passes by , a pressure gradient develops between h ii and h i regions to drive flows .",
    "shocks can naturally occur in such an impulsive expansion phase .",
    "an expansion of a h ii region embedded in a uniform ambient medium has been studied ( e.g. , newman & axford 1968 ; mathews & odell 1969 ) .",
    "other possible environs may involve power - law cloud density profiles of @xmath93 with @xmath94 and a mean of @xmath95 ( e.g. arquilla & goldsmith 1985 ) . as ionization or shock fronts encounter a strong negative density gradient , the ensuing supersonic expansion of the ionized gas",
    "is referred to as the ` champagne phase ' ( ftb ) .",
    "when a fast moving ionization front can not be confined under certain conditions ( ftb ) and ionizes the entire cloud in a relatively short time , the inevitable expansion of h ii regions might evolve into a self - similar phase ( s02 ) .    in the scenario",
    "above , a cloud is presumed static initially and the h ii region forms instantaneously at @xmath3 when the stellar nuclear burning turns on .",
    "our more general scenario would allow a molecular cloud with asymptotic flows ( either winds and breezes or accretions and contractions ) at large @xmath1 .",
    "to model expansions of h ii regions as the ionization front travels , we focus on various possible large - scale systematic flows at large @xmath1 and put aside messy central star - forming processes on much smaller scales . within the ionized cloud sphere , asymptotic winds and accretions at large @xmath1",
    "can be connected to inner champagne flows via transonic shocks . as transients peter out , an expanding h ii region may become self - similar with an outgoing shock to match with an asymptotic wind , breeze or accretion .",
    "the shocked breeze solutions has been used to model similarity expansions of h ii regions ( s02 ) . for each ` champagne breeze ' solution of s02",
    ", we can use the same downstream to construct class ii solutions with shocked upstream flows which approach breezes , winds and accretions at large @xmath1 . as @xmath96 , the downstream solution becomes invariant ( s02 ) and the resulting family of upstream solutions is displayed in fig .",
    "2 .    observations do suggest the presence of systematic flows in h ii regions and models involving stellar winds were proposed ( e.g. dyson 1977 ; hippelein & mnch 1981 ; comern 1997 ) .",
    "such outflows may be supersonic of a few @xmath97 ( e.g. , relao et al .",
    "2003 ) . in reference to our class ii models , shocked similarity `",
    "champagne winds ' in h ii regions distinctly differ from ` champagne breezes ' or sis by having both constant wind speeds at large @xmath1 and outgoing shocks at constant speed . compared with breezes ,",
    "` champagne winds ' would dynamically impact the surrounding interstellar medium more efficiently .      in hydrodynamic models for shaping pne , the interacting stellar wind ( isw ) scenario ( kwok et al . 1978 ) is often invoked . in a few spherical cases ,",
    "a much faster stellar wind from the core catches up with a slower dense wind  the remnant of the agb phase , and form shocks .",
    "our shocked similarity flow solutions of class i clearly show the physical feasibility that the shaping of a pne involving isw can be concurrently accompanied by a central accretion or infall towards a proto white dwarf in a similarity manner . in order to model bipolar pne other than round or mildly elliptical morphologies , aspherical aspects",
    "are included in the so - called generalized isw ( gisw ) model ( balick & frank 2002 ) . by flow instabilities",
    ", a shocked envelope can expand to create various nebula morphologies while the central core continuously accretes materials to form a white dwarf .",
    "as a proto white dwarf continuously accretes materials to approach the chandrasekhar limit of @xmath98 , there might be even a possibility of igniting a type ia supernova explosion .",
