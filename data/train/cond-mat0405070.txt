    "the effects of impurities , dislocations , grain boundaries or other types of quenched disorder on phase transitions and critical points have fascinated physicists for more than 3 decades . in the early days , it was thought that quenched disorder destroys any critical point , because in the presence of defects , the system divides itself up into spatial regions which independently undergo the phase transition at different temperatures .",
    "at such a smeared phase transition , a unique critical temperature for the entire system does not exist , and the singularities in the thermodynamic quantities , which are the characteristic feature of a critical point , are rounded ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , subsequently it became clear that generically a phase transition remains sharp in the presence of quenched disorder , at least for classical systems with short - range disorder correlations .",
    "the fate of a particular clean critical point under the influence of impurities is controlled by the harris criterion @xcite : if the correlation length critical exponent @xmath0 fulfills the inequality @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spatial dimensionality , the disorder does not affect the critical behavior .",
    "if the harris criterion is violated , the generic result in classical systems is a new critical point with conventional power law scaling but new exponents which fulfill the harris criterion .    in recent years",
    ", the problem of quenched disorder and critical points has reattracted a lot of attention because new results have challenged the simple classification outlined above . at quantum phase transitions ,",
    "i.e. , transitions occurring at zero temperature as a function of a nonthermal control parameter , quenched disorder can lead to exotic critical points where the conventional power - law scaling is replaced by exponential ( activated ) scaling ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a prototypical example , the random transverse field ising model ) .",
    "similar effects can also be found in classical systems with linear defects @xcite .",
    "recently , even more dramatic effects have been proposed to occur at some quantum phase transitions in itinerant electronic systems @xcite . at these transitions",
    "a true static order parameter can develop on spatial regions that are more strongly coupled than the bulk system because of disorder fluctuations .",
    "thus , these rare regions undergo a phase transition independently from the rest of the system , leading to a smeared global transition exactly in the sense discussed at the beginning of this section .    in this paper",
    "we explore this smeared phase transition scenario in more detail .",
    "we show that disorder - induced smearing of a critical point is a ubiquitous phenomenon occurring in a wide variety of systems ranging from the above - mentioned itinerant electronic systems to classical ising magnets with planar defects and to non - equilibrium phase transitions . to illustrate the smearing mechanism , we present computer simulations of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) model system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : cps ] , we discuss scaling scenarios for a critical point in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "section [ sec : griffiths ] is devoted to rare regions and griffiths singularities . in section [ sec : smearing ] we discuss how these rare regions can destroy a critical point , and we present numerical results in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss possible scaling scenarios for ( sharp ) critical points in the presence of weak quenched disorder .",
    "weak disorder refers to types of defects which introduce spatial variations of the coupling strength but no frustration or random external fields . for these systems",
    ", three broad classes can be distinguished according to the behavior of the disorder under coarse graining .",
    "the first class consists of clean critical points that fulfill the harris criterion @xcite @xmath3 . at these transitions , the disorder",
    "_ decreases _ under coarse graining , and the system becomes asymptotically homogeneous at large length scales .",
    "consequently , the critical behavior of the dirty system is identical to that of the clean system .",
    "technically , this means the disorder is renormalization group irrelevant , and the clean renormalization group fixed point is stable . in this first class",
    "the macroscopic observables are self - averaging at the critical point , i.e. , the relative width of their probability distributions vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "a prototypical example in this class is the 3d classical heisenberg model whose clean correlation length exponent is @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , fulfilling the harris criterion .",
    "the other two classes occur if the clean critical point violates the harris criterion . in the second class ,",
    "the system remains inhomogeneous at all length scales with the relative strength of the inhomogeneities approaching a finite value for large length scales .",
    "the resulting critical point still displays conventional power - law scaling but with new critical exponents which differ from those of the clean system ( and fulfill the harris criterion ) .",
    "these transitions are controlled by renormalization group fixed points with finite disorder .",
    "macroscopic observables are not self - averaging , the relative width of their probability distributions approaches a size - independent constant @xcite .",
    "an example in this second class is the classical 3d ising model .",
    "its clean correlation length exponent , @xmath5 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) does not fulfill the harris criterion .",
    "introduction of quenched disorder , e.g. , via dilution , thus leads to a new critical point with an exponent of @xmath6 @xcite .    at critical points in the third class ,",
    "the relative magnitude of the inhomogeneities _ increases _ without limit under coarse graining .",
    "the corresponding renormalization group fixed points are characterized by infinite disorder strength . at these infinite - randomness critical points ,",
    "the power - law scaling is replaced by activated ( exponential ) scaling .",
    "the probability distributions of macroscopic variables become very broad ( even on a logarithmic scale ) with the width diverging with system size .",
    "consequently , averages are often dominated by rare events , e.g. , spatial regions with atypical disorder configurations .",
    "this type of behavior was first found in the mccoy - wu model , a 2d ising model with bond disorder perfectly correlated in one dimension @xcite .",
    "however , it was fully understood only when fisher @xcite solved the 1d random transverse field ising model by a version of the ma - dasgupta - hu real space renormalization group @xcite .",
    "since then , several infinite - randomness critical points have been identified , mainly at quantum phase transitions since the disorder , being perfectly correlated in ( imaginary ) time , has a stronger effect for quantum phase transitions than for thermal ones .",
    "examples include 1d random quantum spin chains as well as 1d and 2d random quantum ising models @xcite .",
    "in the last section , we have discussed the global ( average ) behavior of the disorder at a critical point . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the effects of rare strong spatial disorder fluctuations .",
    "such fluctuations can lead to very interesting non - perturbative effects not only directly at the phase transition but also in its vicinity .",
    "these effects , which are known as griffiths phenomena , can be understood as follows : generically , the critical temperature @xmath7 of a disordered system is lower than its clean value , @xmath8 . in the temperature interval @xmath9 , the bulk system is in the disordered phase . however , in an infinite size sample , there is an exponentially small , but nonzero probability for finding an arbitrary large region devoid of impurities .",
    "such a rare region ( or griffiths island ) can develop local order while the bulk system is still disordered .",
    "the dynamics of a rare region is very slow because flipping it requires a coherent change of the order parameter over a large volume .",
    "griffiths @xcite showed that the presence of these locally ordered islands produces an essential singularity @xcite in the free energy in the whole region @xmath9 , which is now known as the griffiths region or the griffiths phase @xcite . in generic classical systems",
    "the griffiths singularity is weak , and it does not significantly contribute to the _ thermodynamic _ observables . to the best of our knowledge , the thermodynamic griffiths singularities in classical systems have not yet been observed in experiments . in contrast , the long - time dynamics is dominated by the rare regions . inside the griffiths phase , the spin autocorrelation function @xmath10 decays as @xmath11 for ising systems @xcite and as @xmath12 for heisenberg systems @xcite .    in quantum systems or classical systems with perfectly correlated disorder ( like the above - mentioned mccoy - wu model ) , the griffiths effects are generically stronger .",
    "effectively , the rare regions are now extended objects which are infinite in the correlated space or imaginary time directions .",
    "this makes their dynamics even slower and so increases their effects @xcite . in 1d and 2d random transverse field ising models ,",
    "the singularity of the free energy in the griffiths phase takes a power - law form with nonuniversal continuously varying exponents .",
    "several thermodynamic observables including the average susceptibility actually diverge in a finite region of the disordered phase @xcite rather than only at the critical point .",
    "similar phenomena have also been found in quantum ising spin glasses @xcite . because quantum griffiths singularities are much stronger than classical ones they should be accessible in experiments .",
    "indeed , the peculiar behavior of many heavy fermion systems in the vicinity of a magnetic quantum phase transition has been interpreted as quantum griffiths behavior @xcite even though the situation is probably more complex , at least for ising symmetry @xcite , as will be explained in the next section .",
    "in the preceeding sections , we have assumed that the phase transition remains sharp in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "we now show that in some systems the rare regions effects can become so strong that the transition is completely destroyed by smearing .",
    "consider a single rare region that is locally in the ordered phase . in the generic case of uncorrelated disorder it is of finite extension .",
    "therefore it can not undergo a true phase transition independently of the bulk system .",
    "instead , it very slowly fluctuates leading to the griffiths effects discussed in section [ sec : griffiths ] .",
    "this argument suggests that the phenomenology of the transition can completely change , if the system permits rare regions that can undergo a true phase transition independently of the bulk , leading to a static order parameter on the rare regions .",
    "it was recently found @xcite that this does indeed happen , and that it leads to a smeared global phase transition .",
    "the behavior of such a smeared transition is markedly different from that of a conventional ( sharp ) continuous phase transition . at a conventional transition",
    ", a non - zero order parameter develops as a collective effect of the entire system which is signified by a diverging correlation length of the order parameter fluctuations at the critical point and accompanying singularities in the thermodynamic observables .",
    "in contrast , at a smeared transition the system divides itself up into spatial regions which independently undergo the transition at different values of the control parameter .",
    "once true static order has developed on some of the rare regions their order parameters can be aligned by an infinitesimally small interaction or external field .",
    "therefore , the global order develops very inhomogeneously over a range of control parameter values .",
    "the correlation length remains finite , and the singularities of the thermodynamic observables are rounded . to show the ubiquity of this smeared transition scenario we now discuss three different examples .      the first class of systems displaying smeared transitions are itinerant quantum magnets with ising order parameter symmetry .",
    "for definiteness we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition .",
    "the landau - ginzburg - wilson free energy functional of the clean transition reads @xcite @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the staggered magnetization , @xmath15 comprises position @xmath16 and imaginary time @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the bare two - point vertex , whose fourier transform is @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the distance of the coupling constant @xmath22 from the ( clean ) critical point .",
    "the dynamical part of @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath24 reflecting the overdamping of the dynamics due to the coupling of the order parameter to fermionic particle - hole excitations ( undamped dynamics leads to @xmath25 ) .",
    "quenched disorder is introduced by making @xmath26 a random function of position , @xmath27 .",
    "we consider a poisson ( dilution ) type of disorder , @xmath28 everywhere except on randomly distributed finite - size islands ( impurities ) of spatial density @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the rare regions in this system are large spatial regions devoid of these impurities .",
    "if @xmath31 , some of the rare regions are locally in the ordered phase .",
    "the crucial difference of the itinerant system considered here and the transverse field ising models of section [ sec : griffiths ] is the overdamped dynamics .",
    "the linear frequency dependence in @xmath23 is equivalent to a long - range interaction in imaginary time of the form @xmath32 .",
    "each rare region is thus equivalent to an 1d ising model with a @xmath33 interaction .",
    "this model is known to have a phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus , true static order can develop on those rare regions which are locally in the ordered phase , leading to a smeared global phase transition as described above @xcite .",
    "physically , this means the rare regions become static because the damping prevents them from tunneling , as was independently shown in ref.@xcite .      a second class of systems which can show smeared transitions are classical magnets with extended impurities .",
    "as an example , consider a 3d classical ising model with planar defects , given by the hamiltonian @xmath34 here , @xmath35 are classical ising spins on the sites of a cubic lattice . in the clean system",
    "all interactions are identical and have the value @xmath36 .",
    "the defects are modelled via weak bonds randomly distributed in one dimension , the uncorrelated dimension .",
    "the bonds in the remaining two ( correlated ) dimensions remain equal to @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the system lengths in the uncorrelated and correlated directions , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 is the random coupling constant in the uncorrelated direction , drawn from a binary probability distribution : @xmath40 = ( 1-p)\\ , \\delta(j_i - j ) + p\\ , \\delta(j_i - cj)\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath41 are constants between 0 and 1 .",
    "thus , the ising magnet has planar impurities of concentration @xmath29 and relative strength @xmath41 of the weak bonds .",
    "rare regions in this system consist of large blocks of planes devoid of weak bonds .",
    "they are infinite in two dimensions ( the correlated dimensions ) but finite in the uncorrelated direction .",
    "since a 2d ising model has an ordered phase , each rare region can independently undergo the magnetic phase transition .",
    "this leads to a smeared global phase transition in the 3d ising model with planar defects @xcite .",
    "physically , the reason for the smearing is different from the itinerant magnets discussed above . here , an isolated rare region can develop a static order parameter because its dimensionality is above the lower critical dimension @xmath42 for the classical ising model .",
    "this also shows that a continuous order parameter symmetry suppresses the tendency towards smearing . in classical magnets with xy or heisenberg symmetry and short - range interactions",
    ", the defects must be at least three - dimensional for smearing to occur since the lower critical dimension for these systems is @xmath43 .      a third class of smeared phase transitions",
    "are non - equilibrium phase transitions with extended spatial defects .",
    "consider , e.g. , the contact process @xcite , a prototypical system in the directed percolation universality class @xcite .",
    "it is defined on a @xmath2-dimensional hypercubic lattice . each site can be vacant or active , i.e , occupied by a particle . during the time evolution ,",
    "particles are created at vacant sites at a rate @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of active nearest neighbor sites and the ` birth rate ' @xmath46 is the control parameter .",
    "particles are annihilated at unit rate . for small @xmath46 ,",
    "annihilation dominates , and the absorbing state without any particles is the only steady state . for large @xmath46 there is a steady state with finite particle density ( active phase ) .",
    "both phases are separated by a nonequilibrium phase transition in the directed percolation universality class at @xmath47 .",
    "we introduce quenched spatial disorder by making the birth rate @xmath46 a random function of the lattice site . as in the preceeding section ,",
    "extended impurities can be described by disorder perfectly correlated in @xmath48 dimensions , but uncorrelated in the remaining @xmath49 dimensions .",
    "@xmath46 is thus a function of @xmath50 which is the projection of the position vector @xmath51 on the uncorrelated directions . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that the @xmath52 have a binary probability distribution @xmath53 = ( 1-p)\\ , \\delta[\\lambda({\\mathbf r}_r)-\\lambda ] + p\\ , \\delta[\\lambda({\\mathbf r}_r ) - c\\lambda]\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath41 are constants between 0 and 1 .",
    "in other words , there are extended impurities of density @xmath29 where the birth rate @xmath46 is reduced by a factor @xmath41 .",
    "rare regions in this disordered contact process are infinite in the correlated dimensions @xmath54 but finite in the @xmath55 random directions .",
    "the directed percolation universality class permits a phase transition for all dimensions @xmath56 . therefore",
    ", each rare region can undergo a phase transition independently of the bulk system .",
    "following the general arguments above , we thus conclude that the global phase transition of a system in the directed percolation universality class is smeared by extended spatial defects @xcite .      in this section",
    "we derive the leading behavior in the tail of a smeared phase transition , i.e. , in the parameter region where a few isolated rare regions have already ordered , but their distance is so large that they are effectively independent . for definiteness we consider the first example , a magnetic quantum phase transition of itinerant electrons .",
    "adaption to the other discussed systems is straight forward .",
    "the theory is similar to that of lifshitz @xcite and others for the band tails in a disordered semiconductor .",
    "the probability @xmath57 for finding a region of linear size @xmath58 devoid of any impurities is given by @xmath59 ( up to pre - exponential factors ) .",
    "such a rare region develops static order at a distance @xmath60 from the _ clean _ critical point .",
    "finite size scaling yields @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the finite - size scaling shift exponent of the clean system @xcite .",
    "thus , the probability for finding a rare region which becomes critical at @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 the total order parameter @xmath14 is obtained by integrating over all rare regions which are ordered at @xmath26 , i.e. , all rare regions having @xmath65 .",
    "this leads to an exponential tail of @xmath14 as a function of the distance @xmath26 from the _ clean _ critical point : @xmath66 note that the functional dependence on @xmath26 of the order parameter on a given island is of power - law type and thus only influences the pre - exponential factors .    at finite temperatures , the static order on the rare regions",
    "is destroyed , and a finite interaction of the order of the temperature is necessary to align them .",
    "this means a sharp phase transition is recovered . to estimate the transition temperature we note that the interaction between two rare regions depends exponentially on their spatial distance @xmath67 which itself , according to ( [ eq : wtc ] ) , depends exponentially on @xmath26",
    "this leads to a double - exponential dependence of the critical temperature on @xmath26 @xmath68    we now turn to finite - size effects at zero temperature .",
    "the total order parameter is the sum of contributions of many independent islands .",
    "therefore , finite size - effects in a macroscopic sample are governed by the central limit theorem . however",
    ", for @xmath69 , very large and thus very rare regions are responsible for the order parameter .",
    "the number @xmath70 of rare regions which start to order at @xmath63 in a sample of size @xmath71 behaves like @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath70 becomes of order one , strong sample - to - sample fluctuations arise . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtc ] ) for @xmath73 , we find that sample - to - sample fluctuations become important at @xmath74 is comparable to that of the clean system . away from these islands , it decays exponentially with distance .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath75 $ ] is therefore very broad , ranging from @xmath76 on the largest islands to @xmath77 on sites very far away from an ordered island .",
    "the _ typical _ local order parameter @xmath78 can be estimated from the typical distance of any point to the nearest ordered island .",

    "@xmath82 is constant .",
    "a comparison with ( [ eq : m - dilute ] ) gives the relation between @xmath78 and the thermodynamic ( average ) order parameter @xmath14 , @xmath83 thus , @xmath78 decays exponentially with @xmath14 indicating an extremely broad local order parameter distribution . in order to determine the functional form of the local order parameter distribution ,",
    "first consider a situation with just a single ordered island at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "for large distances @xmath84 the magnetization falls off exponentially like @xmath85 .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath86=\\log m_0 -r/\\xi_0 $ ] can be calculated from @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of sites at a distance from the origin between @xmath67 and @xmath89 or , equivalently , having a logarithm of the local magnetization between @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for large distances",
    "we have @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the probability distribution of @xmath93 generated by a single ordered island takes the form @xmath94",

    "in this section , we illustrate the disorder - induced smearing of a phase transition by showing numerical data for a classical ising model with two spatial and one time - like dimensions .",
    "the disorder is totally correlated in the time - like direction .",

    "to summarize , we have shown that in several disordered classical and quantum systems , isolated rare spatial regions can undergo a true phase transition independently of the bulk system . as a consequence , different parts of the system undergo the phase transition at different control parameter values , i.e , the global phase transition is smeared by the disorder . for classical phase transitions ,",
    "this scenario requires extended defects whose dimensionality is above the lower critical dimension for the universality class in question .",
    "specifically , for classical ising and heisenberg magnets the ( equilibrium ) phase transition is smeared if the dimensionalities of the defects are at least two and three , respectively .",
    "non - equilibrium phase transitions in the directed - percolation universality class are smeared if the defects are at least linear .",
    "quantum phase transitions display a greater tendency towards smearing because quenched disorder is always perfectly correlated in imaginary time direction ( which has to be taken into account at quantum phase transitions ) . at magnetic quantum phase transitions in itinerant electron systems ,",
    "the rare region effects are further enhanced by landau damping .",
    "this leads to smearing even for point - like impurities . in this final section",
    "we discuss questions of universality , the relation to griffiths phenomena , and the harris criterion .",
    "we also discuss favorable conditions for observing the smearing in experiments or simulations .",
    "the origins of the disorder - induced smearing of the phase transition described in this paper and of griffiths phenomena are very similar , both are caused by rare large spatial regions which are locally in the ordered phase .",
    "the difference lies in the dynamics of the rare regions . in the case of griffiths effects",
    ", the order parameter on a rare region fluctuates slowly leading to the singularities @xcite discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : griffiths ] .",
    "in contrast , smearing occurs if the rare regions actually develop true static order .",
    "a second remark deals with the relation of the disorder - induced smearing and the harris criterion .",
    "we emphasize that the phase transition can be smeared by planar defects even if the corresponding clean critical point fulfills the harris criterion and appears to be stable .",
    "the reason is that the harris criterion assumes a _ homogeneous _ transition and studies the behavior of the coarse - grained ( root - mean - square ) disorder at large length scales .",
    "however , the formation of static order on an isolated finite - size rare region is a non - perturbative finite - length scale effect in the tail of the disorder distribution .",
    "this type of effects is not covered by the harris criterion .",
    "let us also note that the functional dependence of the magnetization and other observables on the temperature is _ not _ universal , it depends on details of the disorder distribution .",
    "therefore , only the presence or absence of smearing is universal in the sense of critical phenomena ( i.e. , depending on dimensionality and symmetry only ) while the thermodynamic relations are non - universal .",
    "we now turn to favorable conditions for the _ observation _ of the smearing in experiments or simulations",
    ". a significant number of large rare regions will only exist if the defect concentration is small . on the other hand ,",
    "the impurities have to be sufficiently strong so that the bulk system is still far away from criticality when the first rare regions start to order .",
    "thus , the most favorable type of disorder for the observation of the smearing is a small density of strong impurities .",
