    "studying human activity patterns is of central interest due to the wide practical usage . understanding the dynamics underlying the timing of various human activities  such as starting a phone call , sending an e - mail or visiting a web - site ",
    "are crucial to modelling the spreading of information or viruses @xcite .",
    "modelling human dynamics is also important in resource allocation .",
    "it has been shown that for many human activities the interevent time distribution follows a power law with exponents usually varying between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "processes with power - law decaying interevent time distribution look very different from the poisson process , which has been used to model the timing of human activities before @xcite .",
    "while time series from the latter look rather homogeneous , the former processes produce bursts of rapidly occurring events , which are separated by long inactive periods .    some examples where",
    "power - law decaying interevent time distribution has been observed are email - communication ( with exponent @xmath5 , @xcite ) , surface mail communication ( @xmath6 , @xcite ) , web - browsing ( @xmath7 , @xcite ) and library loans ( @xmath5 , @xcite ) . in some other cases a monotonous relation has been reported between the user activity and the interevent time exponent , for example in short - message communication ( @xmath8 , @xcite ) or in watching movies ( @xmath9 , @xcite ) . in a recent paper there can be found a distribution of exponents of various channels of communications @xcite .",
    "these observations make it necessary to find a model in which the interevent time exponent is tunable .",
    "similar bursty behaviour has been observed in other natural phenomena , for example in neuron - firing sequences @xcite or in the timings of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "the interevent time distribution does not give us any information about the dependency among the consecutive actions .",
    "correlation between events is usually characterised by the autocorrelation function of the timings of detected events .",
    "bursty behaviour is often accompanied by power - law decaying autocorrelation function @xcite , which is usually thought to indicate long - range dependency , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , time series with independent power - law distributed interevent times show long - range correlations @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with introducing a task - queuing model , which has an advantage compared to the barabsi - model @xcite , namely that the observable is not the waiting time of an action ( from adding the task to the list until executing it ) but the interevent time between similar activities .",
    "we determine the asymptotic decay of the interevent time distribution in a simple limit of the model .",
    "we give a simple proof of the scaling law between the exponents of the interevent time distribution and the autocorrelation function based on tauberian theorems .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the scaling law can be violated if the interevent times are long - range dependent .",
    "we assume that people have a task list of size @xmath10 and they choose their forthcoming activity from this list .",
    "the list is ordered in the sense that the probability @xmath11 of choosing the @xmath12 activity from the list is decreasing as a function of position @xmath13 .",
    "the task at the chosen position jumps to the front ( triggering the corresponding activity ) and pushes the tasks that preceded it to the right ( figure [ fig : listdyn ] ) .",
    "this mechanism is responsible for producing the bursty behaviour because once a person starts to do an activity , that is going to have high priority for a while .",
    "the model is capable of covering many types of activities but now we only concentrate on one type .",
    "the tasks of this type are marked with @xmath14 in figure [ fig : listdyn ] ( e.g. watching movies ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that the list contains only one single item of type @xmath14 , all the others are activities of type @xmath15 .",
    "it turns out that this restriction is important for the interevent time distribution but irrelevant for the autocorrelation function .",
    "we show in our paper that this model produces power - law decaying interevent time distribution for _ a wide variety of the @xmath11 distributions_. first we analyse the model with power - law decaying priority distribution @xmath11 , second we analyse the effect of exponentially decaying priority distribution , and finally we discuss the stretched exponential case .",
    "if the list is finite , the power - law regime is followed by an exponential cutoff .",
    "the cutoff is the consequence of reaching the end of the list , from which a geometrically distributed waiting time follows : @xmath16 .",
    "a marginal result of section [ sec : autocorr ] shows that the expectation value of the interevent time is equal to the length of the list independently on the priority distribution ( as long as ergodicity is maintained ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we determine the exponent of power - law decaying region in the case of an infinitely long list where the exponential cutoff does not appear .",
    "the interevent time is equal to the recurrence time of the first element of the list .",
    "let @xmath17 @xmath18 denote the probability of finding the observed element at position @xmath19 after @xmath20 timesteps without any recurrences up to time @xmath20 .",
    "we emphasise here that @xmath17 is not a conditional probability and that @xmath21 gives the survival function of the interevent time distribution .",
    "the initial condition is set as @xmath22 , that is , at the first step the observed element moves from the front of the list to the second position with probability @xmath23 ( otherwise a recurrence would occur ) .",
    "the restriction not to recur is important because this makes large jumps to the front of the list _ forbidden _ for the observed element .",
    "time evolution is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the survival function of the priority distribution .",
    "equation expresses that the observed element can be found at position @xmath19 either if it was there in the previous time step and we choose a position smaller than @xmath19 or it was at position @xmath26 and we choose an activity at position @xmath27 .",
    "our aim is to determine the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath28 .",
    "the main trick we use in analysing the recursion above is to consider the @xmath29 levels first instead of the @xmath30 levels which intuitively one would do . at every step",
    "the time coordinate gets increased while the position of the observed element might remain unchanged or get increased by one as well ( figure [ fig : q_nt_exp ] )",
    ".     plane . some typical sections in the path corresponding to the @xmath31 random variable",
    "are emphasized by a rectangle.,width=340 ]    the path of the element in the @xmath32 plane can be divided into sections that start with a step on the bias and are followed by some steps upwards ( which can be zero as well ) .",
    "these sections can be characterised by their height - difference , which can take values from @xmath33 .",
    "these height differences are independent and ( optimistic ) geometrically distributed with parameter depending on the position .",
    "let @xmath31 be independent geometrically distributed random variables with parameter @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 . with @xmath19 fixed @xmath17 is the probability that we find the element at the @xmath36 position at time @xmath20 ( without any recurrences ) .",
    "this corresponds to paths with @xmath26 steps to the right ( started from position @xmath0 at time @xmath37 ) and @xmath17 is the distribution mass function of the sum of the random heights .",
    "@xmath38 we could go so far without specifying the priority distribution , now we have to specify @xmath39 to continue .      here",
    "we analyse the model in which the survival function of the priority distribution is power - law decaying , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 means that that term is asymptotically at most of the order of @xmath42 . in this case",
    "@xmath11 is also power - law decaying with exponent @xmath43 . though the random variables @xmath31 are not identically distributed  by checking the lyapunov condition ",
    "one can show that the central limit theorem holds for this situation ( see [ sec : appcltpower ] ) . in this approximation",
    "@xmath17 is gaussian in variable @xmath20 with mean @xmath44 and variance @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . using integral approximation to evaluate the sums and keeping only the highest order terms in @xmath19 yields : @xmath48 this formula shows that the probability of finding an element at position @xmath19 at time @xmath20 is centered on the @xmath49 curve which is in agreement with the numerical results ( figure [ fig : q_nt_cont ] ) .    .",

    "the dashed curve is @xmath50 ( @xmath51).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the sum of @xmath17 in variable @xmath19 is the probability of the observed element has not recurred up to time @xmath20 .",
    "we approximate this sum by integral and we apply the following substitution ( with new variable @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( here @xmath55 may refer to : @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 means that that term is asymptotically of strictly smaller order than @xmath42 . from equations ( [ eq : q_nt_b]-[eq : ngamma ] ) it follows that @xmath59 differentiating this equation gives the first main result of our paper , @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "now we study the model with @xmath62 priority survival function .",
    "in contrast to the previous case the central limit theorem can not be used , because the last term in @xmath63 is comparable with the complete sum .",
    "however , we can construct a limit theorem even for this situation .",
    "first of all , we approximate the geometrically distributed random variables @xmath64 by exponential ones : @xmath65 .",
    "we apply the scaling property of the exponential distribution to express @xmath66 by i.i.d .",
    "exponential random variables : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . in equation we need the distribution of sums of the first @xmath26 @xmath69s : @xmath70 @xmath71 has a well defined limit as @xmath72 , which we denote by @xmath73 . the probability density function of this ( limit ) random variable is denoted by @xmath74 ( and is given explicitly in [ sec : appltexp ] ) .",
    "the finite sum @xmath71 in equation can be approximated by @xmath73 , yielding @xmath75 and @xmath76 since @xmath77 tends to 1 as @xmath78 . by differentiating",
    "we get @xmath79 independently on parameter @xmath80 .",
    "the last investigated priority distribution is the stretched exponential , i.e. @xmath81 .      in this case @xmath83 is totally dominated by the last term in the sum , hence we approximate the sum with this term .",
    "@xmath84 @xmath85 this means that the @xmath79 exponent holds for this case but a logarithmic correction appears .      in this case",
    "the increment of @xmath39 is just small enough for the central limit theorem to be still applicable ( see appendix ) .",
    "we approximate the mean and variance of @xmath63 by integral and we use the property @xmath87 . with these",
    "we get @xmath88 the @xmath78 asymptotic behaviour of @xmath89 can be determined by introducing a proper new variable , @xmath90 keeping the leading order term only , one finds that the survival function of the interevent time distribution is @xmath91 for more details of the calculations see [ sec : appcltstrexp ] .",
    "we have got @xmath79 with logarithmic correction again .",
    "while for @xmath92 the correction makes the decay of the distribution faster than the pure power law , for @xmath93 it is slightly slowed down .",
    "another characteristic property of the time series is autocorrelation function .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the indicator variable of the observed activity : @xmath95 if the observed activity is at the first position of the list at time @xmath20 ( i.e. an event happened ) and @xmath96 otherwise .",
    "we define the autocorrelation function as usual , @xmath97\\right\\rangle_s-\\left\\langle \\mathbb{e}\\left[x(s)\\right ] \\right\\rangle_s^2}{\\left\\langle \\mathbb{e}\\left[x(s)\\right ] \\right\\rangle_s-\\left\\langle \\mathbb{e}\\left[x(s)\\right ] \\right\\rangle_s^2}.\\ ] ] the model defines a markov - chain and the state space is the space of permutations of the list .",
    "the transition matrix for a list of length @xmath10 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "this matrix is doubly stochastic , hence @xmath100\\right\\rangle_t=\\frac{1}{n}$ ] .",
    "according to the recurrence formula of marc kac @xcite we conclude that _ the expectation value of the interevent time is equal to the size of the list independently on the priority distribution _",
    "( as long as ergodicity is maintained ) .",
    "the autocorrelation function can be written in simpler form making use of the knowledge of @xmath100\\right\\rangle_t$ ] , @xmath101 the probability of finding the activity at the first position can be calculated numerically by successive application of the markov - chain transition matrix . for power - law decaying priority distributions",
    "numerical computations show that the autocorrelation function is power - law decaying with an exponential cutoff ( figure [ fig : auto_skala ] ) . given @xmath43 ,",
    "the autocorrelation functions for various list sizes can be rescaled to collapse into a single curve ( figure [ fig : auto_skala ] , inset ) .    s collapse into a single curve if @xmath102 is plotted as a function of @xmath103.,width=377 ]",
    "this property can be written in a mathematical way : @xmath104 the exponents used for rescaling the autocorrelation functions are listed in table [ tab : gammadelta ] .     4 & 5 + @xmath55 & 1.07 & 1.15 & 1.17 & 1.57 & 1.8 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 + @xmath105 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 +    indicating that in the @xmath106 limit the autocorrelation function is power - law decaying with exponent @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "with the exact @xmath61 result this can be combined into a scaling law : @xmath109 .",
    "if the priority distribution decays faster than power - law , then @xmath79 and @xmath110 .",
    "this means that the autocorrelation function decays slower than any power .",
    "this is the case when the priority distribution decays like a ( stretched ) exponential function .",
    "the essential properties of the model for the scaling relation are that the interevent times are independent and power - law decaying .",
    "let @xmath111 denote the set of recurrence times and let @xmath112 be an interevent time .",
    "the autocorrelation function can be written in the following form : @xmath113}}{1-\\frac{1}{\\mathbb{e}\\left[\\tau\\right ] } } \\,,\\ ] ] which simplifies to @xmath114 if @xmath115 . the laplace transform of the autocorrelation function can be expressed by the laplace transform of the interevent time distribution : @xmath116 \\right)^{-1 } , \\ ] ] where we used the property that the interevent times are independent and identically distributed .",
    "tauberian and abelian theorems connect the asymptotics of a function with the asymptotics of its laplace transform @xcite .",
    "applying abelian theorem to the right side of the last equation results in @xmath117 . then applying the tauberian theorem yields @xmath118 or @xmath119 to be precise we had to use an extended version of the abelian theorem , which can be derived from the original theorem using integration by parts . with similar train",
    "of thought the scaling law can be extended to the @xmath120 region where @xmath121 holds .",
    "these results are in agreement with @xcite .",
    "independence of the interevent times was important in the proof of the scaling law .",
    "the violation of the scaling relation indicates dependency among the interevent times but we emphasize that the opposite direction does not necessarily hold . in this section",
    "we investigate two models that are characterised by dependent interevent times .",
    "one of them satisfies the scaling relation and the other does not .",
    "our first example is the two - state model of reference @xcite , because that model was introduced to capture deep correlations , nevertheless , it obeys the scaling law .",
    "we start with a brief introduction of the model .",
    "the system alternates between a normal state @xmath14 , in which the events are separated by longer time intervals , and an excited state @xmath15 , which performs events with higher frequency . after each event executed in state @xmath14",
    "the system may switch to state @xmath15 with probability @xmath122 or remain in state @xmath14 with probability @xmath123 .",
    "in contrast , the excited state has a memory .",
    "that is , if the system had executed more events in state @xmath15 since the last event in the normal state , the transition to state @xmath14 would be less probable .",
    "the probability of performing one more event in state @xmath15 is given by @xmath124 , where @xmath19 is the number of events in the current excited state .",
    "this memory function was introduced to model the empirically observed power - law decay in the bursty event number distribution ( for the definition see the reference ) .",
    "the dynamics is illustrated in figure [ fig : 2statemodel]a ) for a better understanding . in both states",
    "the interevent times are generated from a reinforcement process resulting independent random interevent times @xmath125 and @xmath126 with power - law decaying distributions .",
    "we denote the corresponding exponents by @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the parameters of the model were the following : @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and it was found that the model satisfies the scaling law with exponents @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "\\a )   and the lower sticks correspond to events performed in state @xmath15 .",
    "looking at the time series at a larger scale the ratio of @xmath15 periods shrinks .",
    "for the better visibility of the time series the model parameters were changed to @xmath135 and @xmath136.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] b )   and the lower sticks correspond to events performed in state @xmath15 .",
    "looking at the time series at a larger scale the ratio of @xmath15 periods shrinks .",
    "for the better visibility of the time series the model parameters were changed to @xmath135 and @xmath136.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    the number of events performed in a single period of state @xmath14 or @xmath15 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath137 or @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath137 is geometrically distributed with parameter @xmath122 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath138 can be easily obtained from @xmath139 , and it is power - law decaying with exponent @xmath140 . making use of these new random variables the dynamics",
    "simplifies : the system executes @xmath137 events with interevent times distributed as @xmath125 , then switches to the excited state and executes @xmath138 events with interevent times @xmath126 , then switches back to the normal state , and so on .",
    "it is clear that the decay of the interevent time distribution of the whole process is determined by the smallest of the exponents @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "since both of @xmath141 $ ] and @xmath142 $ ] are finite , the periods of state @xmath15 have a characteristic length @xmath143\\mathbb{e}\\left[n_b\\right]$ ] . within the periods of state @xmath14",
    "there is no characteristic time - scale , hence by looking on the time series at a larger scale the effective length of the @xmath15 periods will be shorter ( figure [ fig : 2statemodel]b ) ) .",
    "therefore the existence of the @xmath15 periods is irrelevant for the asymptotic decay of the autocorrelation function giving rise to the scaling law .",
    "another simple way to introduce dependency between the interevent times is to construct a markov - chain , i.e. the next interevent time depends only on the actual interevent time . as a counterexample to the scaling law",
    "we constructed a long - range dependent set of interevent times by metropolis - algorithm .",
    "the base of the algorithm is constructing a markov chain on the integers that has power - law decaying stationary distribution @xmath144 .",
    "the algorithm uses a proposal density ( transition rate ) @xmath145 which generates a proposal sample from the current value of the interevent time .",
    "this sample is accepted for the next value with probability @xmath146 otherwise the previous value is repeated . to generate a power - law distributed sample with long - range dependency",
    "the mixing of the markov chain should be slow , i.e. the gap in the spectrum of the markov chain should vanish . in this order",
    "we allow only small differences between consecutive interevent times : @xmath147 or equivalently @xmath148 as a random variable is discrete uniformly distributed : @xmath149 $ ] .     and parameter @xmath150 of the proposal density is varied .",
    "the dashed line shows the decay corresponding to the scaling law of independent processes.,width=377 ]    the simulation results ( figure [ fig : metro ] ) show that the autocorrelation function decays slower than it would be assumed from the scaling law .",
    "this example shows that the scaling relation can be violated if there is long range dependency among the interevent times .",
    "a trivial extension of the model could be putting more items of the observed activity into the list .",
    "then this parameter would tune the frequency of doing the activity . in this case",
    "the interevent times become dependent and the simulation results on finite lists show that the interevent time distribution decays faster than power - law but decays slower than an exponential function .",
    "it is easy to prove that in spite of this the autocorrelation function is independent of the number of the observed activity and remains power - law decaying .",
    "this is another example for models in which the scaling law does not hold .",
    "when the list is finite , we have much more freedom in the choice of the priority distribution .",
    "however , the method based on expressing @xmath17 as a probability density function of sum of @xmath26 independent geometrically distributed random variables is general , and can offer a good base for further calculations , even for finite lists .",
    "the model may be interesting not only for human dynamics but also for the mathematical theory of card shuffling @xcite .",
    "we can define the time reversed version of the model in which we choose a position from the same distribution as in the original model and we move the first element of the list to the random position .",
    "this model has similar properties to the original model , e.g. this model has the same interevent time distribution and autocorrelation function .",
    "if we think of the list as a _ deck of cards _ , then the time reversed model is a generalisation of the _ top - in - at - random shuffle _ method .",
    "the latter is a primitive model of shuffling cards : the top card is removed and inserted into the deck at a uniformly distributed random position @xcite .",
    "in a proper model one should take into consideration the dependency among the interevent times besides the interevent time distribution . in human dynamics",
    "the latter is slowly decaying and as a consequence of this the autocorrelation function of the interevent times is not well - defined ( i.e. the second moment does not exist ) .",
    "however , the autocorrelation function of the time series exists and it might be a good measure for long range dependency among the interevent times .",
    "time series of messages sent by an individual in an online community are reported to be not more correlated than an independent process with the same interevent time distribution @xcite .",
    "similarly , the exponents in the neuron - firing sequences approximately satisfy the scaling law ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 @xcite ) . for these systems",
    "the model we studied might be applicable .",
    "however , this is not always the case .",
    "for example , the autocorrelation function of the e - mail sequence decays slower ( @xmath153 @xcite ) than it should do estimated from the scaling law .",
    "this indicates long range dependency in the time series in addition to the power - law decaying interevent time distribution . in this case",
    "a dependent model should be applied , for example a model based on metropolis algorithm that is similar to the one we studied as a counterexample to the scaling law .",
    "effects of circadian patterns and inhomogeneity in an ensemble of individuals should also be considered @xcite .    in real networks interactions between individuals",
    "have to be taken into account to reproduce some social phenomena , e.g. temporal motifs @xcite observed in a mobile call dataset .",
    "interactions could be incorporated in this model by allowing the actual activity of an individual to modify the priority list of some of his / her neighbour .",
    "if this effect is rare and can be considered as a perturbation , our results on the dynamics of the list could be a starting point to further calculations covering for example information flow in a network .",

    "<S> many human - related activities show power - law decaying interevent time distribution with exponents usually varying between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study a simple task - queuing model , which produces bursty time series due to the nontrivial dynamics of the task list . </S>",
    "<S> the model is characterised by a priority distribution as an input parameter , which describes the choice procedure from the list . </S>",
    "<S> we give exact results on the asymptotic behaviour of the model and we show that the interevent time distribution is power - law decaying for any kind of input distributions that remain normalisable in the infinite list limit , with exponents tunable between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model satisfies a scaling law between the exponents of interevent time distribution ( @xmath2 ) and autocorrelation function ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this law is general for renewal processes with power - law decaying interevent time distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that slowly decaying autocorrelation function indicates long - range dependency only if the scaling law is violated . </S>"
