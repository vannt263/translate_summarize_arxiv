    "iras 04000 + 5052 ( galactic coordinates : 150.86 , -1.12 ) has an iras lrs spectrum and iras fluxes consistent with an region @xcite .",
    "@xcite found @xmath0co emission in the direction of the object and calculate galactocentric and heliocentric distances of 12.04 and 3.88 kpc , respectively ( assuming a solar galactocentric distance of 8.5 kpc ) for the molecular emission .",
    "this indicates that iras 04000 + 5052 if really associated with the molecular cloud is located beyond the solar circle , and beyond the perseus arm .",
    "@xcite found a near - infrared ( nir ) variable source associated with the iras source , probably a young object embedded in the region . in a more recent study , wang , wei , & hu ( 2002 ) have carried out a more complete study of the object , based on nir imagery and optical spectroscopy .",
    "these authors find an isolated high - mass protostellar infrared cluster of 15 objects associated with the iras source , where a b0.5-type star ( their irs  7 object ) is the ionizing source of the region .",
    "@xcite classify iras 04000 + 5052 as a compact region based on the criteria of its size and location in a star - forming molecular cloud .",
    "these authors also estimate the [ ] /h@xmath1 ratio of the nebula from gaussian fitting of the blend of h@xmath1 and [ ] 6548 and 6584   lines measured in their low - resolution spectrum ( @xmath2 10  ) .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath1 ratio they find is about 1/16.3 , which is the lowest value ever reported for a galactic region ; this result suggests that iras 04000 + 5052 is a rather peculiar metal - poor nebula and merits further investigation .",
    "we have carried out optical spectroscopy and imagery of iras 04000 + 5052 in order to obtain a more precise determination of its chemical composition and to disentangle the true nature of the object .",
    "intermediate - resolution spectroscopy was obtained in 2002 december 27 , with the isis spectrograph at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) of roque de los muchachos observatory in la palma , spain .",
    "two different ccds were used at the blue and red arms of the spectrograph : an eev ccd with a configuration 4096 @xmath3 2048 pixels of 13.5 @xmath4 m in the blue arm and a marconi ccd with 4700 @xmath3 2148 pixels of 13.5 @xmath4 m in the red arm .",
    "the dichroic used to separate the blue and red beams was set at 5400  .",
    "the slit was 3.7@xmath5 long and 1.03@xmath6 wide .",
    "two gratings were used , the r1200b in the blue arm and the r316r in the red arm .",
    "these gratings give reciprocal dispersions of 17 and 62   mm@xmath7 , and effective spectral resolutions of 0.86 and 3.81    for the blue and red arms , respectively .",
    "the blue spectra cover from 4456 to 5484   and the red ones from 5370 to 8690  .",
    "the spatial scale is 0.20@xmath6 pixel@xmath7 in both arms .",
    "the slit was centered on the brightest part of the nebula with a position angle of 90@xmath8 ( east - west ) .",
    "three 600 seconds exposures were taken and combined to obtain good signal - to - noise and an appropriate removal of cosmic rays .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated with a cune+cuar lamp .",
    "the correction for atmospheric extinction was performed using the average curve for continuous atmospheric extinction at roque de los muchachos observatory .",
    "the absolute flux calibration of the spectra was achieved by observations of the standard stars feige  15 , feige  110 , h  600 and hz  44 .",
    "all the ccd frames were reduced using the standard @xmath9 twodspec reduction package to perform bias correction , flat - fielding , cosmic - ray rejection , wavelength and flux calibration , and sky subtraction .",
    "the optical ccd images were obtained in 2004 january 21 at the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) at roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "we used the alfosc ( andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ) in image mode with a e2v ccd detector ( 2048 @xmath3 2048 pixels ) with a pixel size of 13.5 @xmath4 m and spatial resolution of 0.19@xmath6 pixel@xmath7 .",
    "the narrow - band filters for the h@xmath1 and continuum have a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 33 and 51  , respectively .",
    "the continuum filter has its central wavelength at 6891  .",
    "the average seeing of the images was 1.2@xmath6 .",
    "four exposures of 300 seconds in h@xmath1 and 3 exposures of 150 seconds in the continuum were added to obtain a good signal - to - noise ratio and an appropriate removal of cosmic rays in the final images .",
    "the images were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and flux calibrated following standard procedures making use of @xmath9 software , in particular the focas package .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was performed using the spectrophotometric standard stars feige 110 and hr 1544 , and following the method proposed by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the resulting h@xmath1 image of iras  04000 + 5052 .",
    "the h@xmath1 image of the nebula ( figure [ fig1 ] ) shows much more detail than the broad - band nir and br@xmath10 images published by @xcite . iras  04000 + 5052",
    "has a patchy structure with the presence of dark zones and a very faint extended ionized halo .",
    "the morphology is typical of an region associated with a substantial amount of obscuring material and a star - forming zone .",
    "the bidimensional spectrum shows that h@xmath1 is the brightest line of the nebula .",
    "the profile of this line is rather complex along a substantial part of the spatial extension of the nebula .",
    "this profile can be reproduced by the combination of two gaussian components of different widths .",
    "the relative contribution of the broad component is more important at the position of the stellar continuum of irs  7 ( the variable nir source found by wang et al .",
    "2002 that corresponds to the brightest star embedded in the nebula ) and decreases as one goes farther from the star .",
    "this fact indicates that the broad component is produced by the light of a stellar emission feature scattered by the dust mixed with the ionized gas . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the relative contribution of the broad and narrow components of the h@xmath1 line ( as well as the [ ] /h@xmath1 intensity ratio ) for different slices of the spectrum along the brightest part of the nebula . the line profile was analyzed via a double gaussian fitting using starlink dipso software package @xcite .",
    "for each gaussian fit , dipso gives the fit parameters ( radial velocity centroid , integrated flux , fwhm , etc ) and their associated statistical errors . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show examples of gaussian fits in two small different zones of the nebula .",
    "the broad ( stellar ) component is specially important in the zone surrounding irs  7 ( figure [ fig3 ] , left ; and also figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic ( corrected for instrumental profile ) fwhm of the broad component is about 520 km s@xmath7 in that zone .",
    "in contrast , the intrinsic fwhm of the narrow ( nebular ) component of h@xmath1 is typically of the order of 30@xmath1150 km s@xmath7 . in the right panel of figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show an example of a zone without a noticeable contribution of the broad component . the broad h@xmath1 component should be related to the reflection of a stellar emission feature produced by a circumstellar disk or strong stellar winds associated with irs  7 , the most probable ionization source of the region .",
    "we extracted a single onedimensional spectrum integrating from 2 to 15 arcsec to the west of irs  7 ( shown in figure 1 ) in order to estimate the physical conditions and chemical abundances of the ionized gas .",
    "we avoided the zone around irs  7 because the important contribution of the broad component to the total h@xmath1 flux .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows parts of the blue and red spectra of iras  04000 + 5052 .",
    "h@xmath12 is the only line detected in the blue spectrum and shows a rather low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "line intensities were measured integrating all the flux between two given limits and over a local continuum estimated by eye . in table 1",
    "we include the observed and derredened line intensity ratios with respect to @xmath13(h@xmath12 ) of the emission lines detected in the integrated onedimensional spectrum .",
    "a relatively small contribution of the broad component of h@xmath1 is still present in this spectrum . in table 1",
    "we include the individual parameters of the two components of h@xmath1 .",
    "the observed line intensities have been corrected for interstellar reddening using the @xcite law and the reddening constant , @xmath14 .",
    "this constant has been derived from the ratio between the observed h@xmath12 and h@xmath1 narrow component line intensities as compared with the theoretical values expected for case b recombination using @xcite and assuming an electron temperature of 10,000 k. the value of @xmath14 is 3.1@xmath150.5 , which corresponds to an extinction of @xmath16 = 6.5@xmath151.1 magnitudes .",
    "@xcite estimate a lower limit of @xmath16 of about 2.64 magnitudes from their upper limit to the intensity of h@xmath12 , which is not detected in their spectrum . in table 1",
    ", we have also included the velocity ( with respect to the local standard of rest , @xmath17 ) corresponding to the centroid of the single or double gaussian fitting of the lines .",
    "the reddening - corrected h@xmath12 line flux of the onedimensional spectrum is 3@xmath18 @xmath3 10@xmath19 erg @xmath20 s@xmath7 .",
    "the weighted mean of the @xmath17 of the different lines except that of the broad h@xmath1 component is @xmath1130.1@xmath150.5 , which is entirely consistent with the velocity obtained by @xcite from the @xmath0co(@xmath21 = 1@xmath110 ) emission in the direction to the optical nebula , @xmath17 = @xmath1130.5@xmath150.2 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this result proves that the nebula is certainly associated with the molecular emission reported by @xcite .",
    "these authors determined a kinematic heliocentric distance of 3.88 kpc for iras  04000 + 5052 . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite derived a photometric distance of 4.29 kpc using the observed @xmath22 magnitude of irs  7 , its estimated b0.5 spectral type , and their lower limit of the extinction ( @xmath23 = 0.11 @xmath3 @xmath16 = 0.29 mag ) .",
    "following the same procedure of those authors , we have recalculated the photometric distance of iras  04000 + 5052 using our more precise value of @xmath23 = 0.72 mag , finding a distance of 3.55 kpc , which is also fairly similar to the kinematic one .",
    "however , those authors implicitly assume a @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath113.85 mag for their calculations without quoting any reference .",
    "we have revised the recent literature finding that the absolute @xmath22 magnitude given by @xcite seems to be excessively bright .",
    "hanson , howarth , & conti ( 1997 ) obtain @xmath24 = @xmath111.56 mag for a zams b0.5 v star . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite finds an average @xmath26 = @xmath112.75 for a sample of 12 galactic b0.5 iv@xmath11v stars with @xmath27 parallaxes . using the intrinsic @xmath28 color of b0.5 v stars of @xmath110.79 obtained by @xcite we derive an expected @xmath24 = @xmath111.96 for this kind of stars .",
    "these two determinations of the absolute @xmath22 magnitude are about two magnitudes fainter than the value adopted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite indicates that it is common that be stars are brighter than normal b stars of the corresponding spectral types , about 0.5 mag in the case of b0.5 stars .",
    "as we can see , the appropriate value of the absolute magnitude of the ionizing star is uncertain and this makes difficult to fix a precise value of the photometric distance for the object .",
    "if we assume a @xmath24 between @xmath111.5 and @xmath112.5 mag , this would imply a heliocentric distance between 1.2 and 1.9 kpc , and that the object could belong to the perseus arm ( located at about 2 kpc , see russeil 2003 ) .",
    "this result is contrary to the claim of @xcite that iras  04000 + 5052 is located beyond that spiral arm .",
    "differences between kinematic and photometric distances are rather usual , in fact , @xcite in its recent revision of the distribution of star - forming complexes and the structure of the galaxy , indicates that velocity anomalies are common in the perseus arm .",
    "@xcite estimate the number of lyman continuum photons , @xmath29(lyc ) , that ionizes the nebula considering the radio continuum flux density at 1.4 ghz obtained from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and assuming a heliocentric distance of 3.88 kpc , finding log @xmath29(lyc ) = 46.27 , value that corresponds to a zams star of spectral type b0.5 @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the integrated flux from our dereddened flux calibrated and continuum - subtracted h@xmath1 ccd image of the nebula finding a value of 6.64@xmath30 10@xmath31 erg @xmath20 s@xmath7 .",
    "assuming a representative value of the heliocentric distance of about 1.5 kpc ( we have not considered errors for the distance in the following because it is rather undefined ) , we obtain an h@xmath1 luminosity of @xmath32 = 1.79@xmath33 erg s@xmath7 , which corresponds assuming an ionization - bounded nebula to log @xmath29(lyc ) = 46.12@xmath34 ( i. e. osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "this ionizing flux is consistent with a zams star of b0.5 spectral type , in accidental agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we consider that the central object irs  7 can be classified as a herbig be star attending to several facts : a ) its early b spectral type ; b ) the presence of broad h@xmath1 emission related to the star ; c ) its pre - main sequence nature ( due to its association with a very young stellar cluster , an region , and a molecular cloud ) .",
    "the corresponding galactocentric distance of the object is about 9.8 kpc ( assuming the sun at 8.5 kpc ) .    from figure [ fig4 ] and table 1",
    "it is clear that h@xmath1 and the two lines of [ ] doublet are well resolved in our spectrum , and that the [ ] ( 6584 )/h@xmath1 ratio is 0.25 , much larger than the value of 0.06 derived by @xcite from a gaussian fitting of an unresolved blend of those lines .",
    "this result refutes the statement by @xcite that iras  04000 + 5052 is a metal - poor nebula with the lowest [ ] /h@xmath1 line ratio known in galactic regions .",
    "in contrast , our value of 0.25 coincides with the average of the [ ] ( 6584 )/h@xmath1 ratio observed in a sample of 15 galactic regions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath1 ratio valuated only for the nebular or narrow component of h@xmath1 is almost constant along the nebula , as it can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "we can not determine the electron temperature of the ionized gas and , therefore , it is not possible to obtain a direct estimation of the chemical abundances of the nebula . in any case",
    ", we can indirectly estimate the metallicity making use of empirical calibrations .",
    "denicol , terlevich , & terlevich ( 2002 ) propose a calibration of the o / h ratio vs. the [ ] ( 6584 )/h@xmath1 ratio .",
    "using this relation we obtain a oxygen abundance of 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.70 , a value typical of regions of the solar vicinity . in figure",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show two diagnostic diagrams ( adapted from sabbadin , minello , & bianchini 1977 ) involving the locus of several line ratios we have observed in the nebula . these diagrams clearly indicate that iras  04000 + 5052 is radiatively excited and has a spectrum of a typical region , consistently with that suggested by its iras lrs spectrum , iras fluxes , and morphology .",
    "the detection and measurement of the [ ] doublet at 6716 and 6731   allows to deriving the electron density of the nebula . using the five - level program for the analysis of emission - line nebulae",
    "included in iraf nebular task @xcite and our observed [ ] 6717/6731 ratio we obtain an electron density of 540@xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "this is a density similar to that observed from collisionally excited line ratios in other normal galactic regions .",
    "for example , the central parts of the orion nebula have electron densities between 3000 and 5000 @xmath36 @xcite and m17 between 500 and 1000 @xmath36 @xcite . @xcite",
    "obtain densities between @xmath37100 @xmath36 and 550 @xmath36 for a sample of regions located toward the galactic anticenter . from figure [ fig1 ] and the adopted distance of 1.5 kpc it is possible to estimate the approximate linear dimensions of the nebula , which are about 0.19 pc @xmath3 0.14 pc .    from our dereddened value of the h@xmath1 flux and the diameter of the nebula we can estimate its root mean square density using the usual formulae ( i.e. gurzadyan 1997 ) , which is @xmath38(rms ) = 950@xmath15150 @xmath36 .",
    "this value is larger than the density obtained from the [ ] doublet but consistent within the uncertainties , result that indicates that the volume filling factor of the nebula should be about 1 .",
    "it is necessary to remark that the exact value of @xmath38(rms ) is extremely dependent on the assumed distance , which is rather uncertain in this case .",
    "the corresponding ionized mass of the nebula is very small : 0.11@xmath150.04 m@xmath39 . in table 2",
    "we compare some physical parameters of iras  04000 + 5052 with those typical of compact and `` classical '' normal regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose that iras  04000 + 5052 is a compact region attending to size considerations and its association with a molecular cloud but lacking of any information about electron density . from table 2",
    "we can see that , since the size and mass of the nebula are of the order of those of typical compact regions , the density is consistent with the typical values of normal regions .",
    "we consider that the small linear size an ionized mass of the nebula is due to the rather weak ionizing flux of the star , which is relatively cold because of its estimated b0.5 spectral type .",
    "therefore , we consider that iras  04000 + 5052 should be considered a relatively normal small region ionized by a rather weak and cold ionizing source .",
    "we present new observations of iras  04000 + 5052 , a faint galactic region associated with a small and isolated protostellar cluster probably located at the perseus arm .",
    "we have found that this region is associated with a molecular cloud and that it can not be considered a compact metal - poor region located beyond the perseus arm as it was proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is ionized by a stellar source of b0.5 spectral type , perhaps a herbig be star .",
    "its corresponding ionizing flux is rather weak and the size of its associated h@xmath40 sphere is correspondingly small , with a diameter of the order of 0.2 pc .",
    "the region is very faint , highly reddened and patchy , as expected due to its association with a molecular cloud and a zone of recent star formation .",
    "the electron density of the nebula is consistent with that of typical regions and not of compact ones .",
    "definitively , the nebula is not a metal  poor object , its [ ] ( 6584 )/h@xmath1 ratio is 0.25 , larger than the value of 0.06 previously determined by @xcite and consistent with that of normal regions of the galactic disk .",
