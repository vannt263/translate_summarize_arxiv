    "in phenomenologically interesting models the effects of broken supersymmetry in the visible sector are conveniently parameterized , working in an off - shell formulation , by the expectation values of the auxiliary components of some hidden sector supermultiplets . among the auxiliary fields , the scalar @xmath1 , belonging to the graviton supermultiplet , @xmath2 , stands out as special .",
    "indeed , unlike for auxiliary fields belonging to matter and gauge hidden sector multiplets , the coupling of @xmath1 is completely fixed ( at the leading relevant order ) once the masses and self - couplings of the low energy effective theory , prior to supersymmetry breaking , are specified .",
    "this property just follows from @xmath1 being a partner of @xmath3 whose coupling is equally well specified by the energy momentum tensor of the low energy effective theory .",
    "the scenario of ` anomaly mediated ' ( am ) supersymmetry breaking corresponds to the limiting case in which the contribution of @xmath1 dominates over all of the others @xcite .",
    "the name ` anomaly mediated ' is due to the fact that in the mssm @xmath1 only couples to the visible fields at the quantum level , via a supersymmetric analogue of the dilatation anomaly of non - supersymmetric field theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper will not be to build phenomenological models based on am , but rather to investigate some of its more amusing theoretical aspects .",
    "in fact , far away from the domain of phenomenology , we shall be working in four dimensional supersymmetric anti - de - sitter ( ads ) space .",
    "we nonetheless believe that our study provides interesting additional insight into the properties of am , in particular its being uv insensitive , in spite of being uv generated .    to set the stage ,",
    "it is convenient to derive am terms via the superconformal approach to supergravity @xcite . at tree level",
    ", the most general two - derivative lagrangian may be written as @xmath4_d+   \\left \\{\\bigl [ s^3 w(\\phi_i)+ f(\\phi_i ) w^{\\alpha}w_{\\alpha})\\bigr ] _ f + { { \\rm h.c.}}\\right \\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are superconformally invariant densities , provided that the chiral superfield , @xmath7 , and the matter fields , @xmath8 , have weyl weights 1 and 0 , respectively .",
    "interesting actions are obtained by consistently taking the lowest component of @xmath7 with non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "this breaks the superconformal group down to poincar supergravity and turns @xmath7 into a purely auxiliary field , formally restoring scale invariance , hence the name ` superconformal compensator ' .",
    "indeed a suitable superconformal gauge can be chosen where @xmath9 .",
    "the couplings of the auxiliary field @xmath1 are thus fixed by dilations and r - symmetry .",
    "in particular a classically scale invariant subsector , like the mssm , couples to @xmath1 only at the quantum level . for a massless gauge theory the coupling of @xmath7",
    "is easily read off by demanding formal scale- ( and r- ) invariance of the 1pi action at 1-loop @xmath10_f + h.c.\\ ] ] by expanding in components , one finds a gaugino mass term which is proportional to the @xmath11-function @xmath12 the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath7 is local , compatibly with its being uv generated . however",
    ", it belongs to a non - local supergravity invariant ` structure ' ( involving @xmath14 ) , and this is why it is convenient to use the 1pi action to determine it .",
    "this is just the supersymmetric generalization of a dilaton coupling to the trace anomaly , hence the name ` anomaly mediation ' .    in models with broken supersymmetry and vanishing cosmological constant , @xmath15 , implying a 1-loop contribution of order @xmath16 to gaugino and sfermion masses .",
    "however , one may also have @xmath17 , with unbroken supersymmetry on ads . in that case",
    ", the expectation value is given by the superpotential : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ads radius .",
    "indeed , at tree level , @xmath20 generates the mass splittings , of order of the ads curvature , that are required by supersymmetry in ads .",
    "the rle of a loop effect like anomaly mediation is less clear in this case , though it ought to be easy to understand , given that the theory still enjoys unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "the purpose of this note is to explain the rle played by anomaly mediation in supersymmetric ads .",
    "this issue was briefly considered in @xcite , in the context of a general discussion in which the short distance origin of am was emphasized .",
    "however our explanation for the rle of am in ads space differs from the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will argue that the existence of am is a necessary consequence of supersymmetry , given the large - distance properties of ads space , in particular the presence of a ( conformal ) boundary . in this sense ,",
    "our work represents yet another way of deriving am masses , purely via consideration of ir saturated quantities .",
    "the outline is as follows . in section [ adssusy ] ,",
    "we review supersymmetry in ads and supersymmetric qed therein . in section [ mass ] , we compute the 1-loop contributions to the gaugino self - energy in sqed with massless matter , and discuss the implications for the gaugino mass . in section [ out ] , we present conclusions . the case of sqed with massive matter",
    "is relegated to the appendix .",
    "in this section , we briefly review some basic features of supersymmetry in four - dimensional ads space which will be relevant for the following discussion . for more details , see @xcite and refs .  therein .",
    "the isometry group of ads@xmath0 is @xmath21 , whose unitary , infinite - dimensional representations are denoted by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent respectively the energy and spin of the lowest energy state in the representation .",
    "the lagrangian mass parameter of the corresponding fields ( in units of @xmath25 ) are functions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , for the simplest cases of @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 just as in flat space , the simplest irreducible representations of the super - group @xmath28 correspond to chiral and vector supermultiplets .",
    "a chiral supermultiplet decomposes into the following representations of @xmath21 : @xmath29 note that the supersymmetry generators raise and lower @xmath23 by a half - integer .",
    "then , according to eqs .",
    "( [ scalar]),([fermion ] ) , the mass terms for fermions and scalars within the same supermultiplet are not , in general , the same .",
    "these splittings are mandated by @xmath28 and originate within the lagrangian from two sources .",
    "one source is the non - vanishing ricci scalar and the other source is @xmath20 .",
    "notice , finally , that in the special case of the conformally - coupled supermultiplet , with @xmath30 , the two scalars have the same mass , even though they belong to different representations : namely @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "turning now to the massless vector supermultiplet , the @xmath21 representation content is @xmath33 this multiplet is both conformally coupled and ` short ' , corresponding to its being related to a gauge invariant lagrangian .",
    "a massive vector multiplet , on the other hand , is characterized by @xmath34 , and decomposes as @xmath35 this is a long multiplet that can be viewed as arising from a higgs mechanism .",
    "indeed , it has the same state multiplicity as the direct sum of the massless vector supermultiplet and the goldstone supermultiplet , whose content is @xmath36 .",
    "since it corresponds to multiplet shortening , the masslessness condition must be stable in perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , the gaugino mass , for an unbroken gauge symmetry , must be zero to all orders .",
    "the presence of the anomaly mediated contribution to the mass ( [ gauginomass ] ) is , navely , at odds with the previous observation that the gaugino should be massless . to clarify the rle of am , we shall focus on the simplest non - trivial example , that is the mass of the gaugino in supersymmetric qed .",
    "our theory consists of @xmath37 supergravity with a vector superfield @xmath38 , and two chiral superfields @xmath39 , with opposite charges @xmath40 .",
    "the khler and superpotential functions are given by ( throughout the paper we use the conventions of wess and bagger @xcite ) @xmath41 since we shall be working in the neighbourhood of @xmath42 , we neglect the higher order terms indicated by @xmath43 .",
    "the constant term in the superpotential gives rise to the ads@xmath0 background and to the expectation value of the compensator , @xmath44 we will find it technically convenient to work in the poincar patch , with metric @xmath45 the co - ordinates @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 cover only one of an infinite set of similar poincar patches of the full ads space .",
    "however poincar co - ordinates cover the whole euclidean ads ( eads ) , which can be obtained just by the substitution @xmath49 ( see for instance the discussion in ref .",
    "this last property indicates that , if properly interpreted , computations on the poincar patch yield informations about the properties of qft on full ads . assuming @xmath19 to be positive , in these co -",
    "ordinates the four unbroken supersymmetries are parameterized by the killing spinors @xmath50+z^{-1/2 } x_\\mu \\sigma^\\mu [ \\epsilon_0+i \\sigma^3 \\bar{\\epsilon}_0 ] , \\label{unbrokensusy}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a two - component constant spinor .",
    "notice that the killing spinors naturally decompose into two real spinors of @xmath52 .",
    "the first of these corresponds to the standard @xmath37 in 2 + 1 dimensions , while the other corresponds to the conformal supersymmetry .",
    "in fact , for our purposes it will suffice to consider the flat supersymmetries , as the others are implied by the ads isometries .    by taking the limit @xmath53 with",
    "@xmath19 fixed , we decouple gravity and focus on quantum effects that are purely due to sqed on ads@xmath0 .",

    "one sees that the scalars acquire non - holomorphic mass terms , originating from the non - vanishing ricci scalar , and holomorphic ( b - type ) masses , arising from the compensator f - term .",
    "( the fermionic mass and interaction terms , by contrast , retain the same form as in flat space . ) the scalar mass eigenstates and their masses are given by @xmath56    eqs .",
    "( [ gauginomass]),([compensator ] ) imply the presence of an am contribution to the gaugino mass , given by @xmath57 as explained above and emphasized in @xcite , a gaugino mass would be incompatible with supersymmetry in ads@xmath0 . indeed , for @xmath58",
    ", there is an additional contribution to @xmath59 , corresponding to a finite threshold effect at the scale @xmath55 , where matter is integrated out .",
    "this is due to the presence of both a fermion mass and an r - breaking b - type mass for the scalars . by the well known property of am in flat space ,",
    "we can directly conclude that , at least for @xmath60 , the threshold effect cancels eq .",
    "( [ gauginobilinear ] ) , at least up to subleading effects of @xmath61 .",
    "however , it would be nice to see the exact cancellation in an explicit computation . moreover , in the limit @xmath62",
    ", corresponding to conformal multiplets , there seems to be a puzzle , in that all sources of r - symmetry breaking disappear from the matter lagrangian ! in other words , for @xmath62 there is , at first sight , no obvious contribution in addition to eq .",
    "( [ gauginobilinear ] ) . in @xcite",
    ", it was concluded that the contribution in eq .",
    "( [ gauginobilinear ] ) does not affect the physical mass ( defined in the sense of the representation of ads ) , since @xmath63 runs to zero in the infrared .",
    "this explanation is , however , puzzling , as it requires an all - orders resummation of diagrams , while we expect the supersymmetry algebra to be satisfied at each finite order in perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , this argument can not be applied to the non - abelian case . in",
    "actual fact , the resolution of the gaugino mass puzzle has to do with the boundary conditions in ads , which shall be discussed in the next section .",
    "what we shall find there is that boundary effects provide a calculable , ir saturated , contribution to the gaugino bilinear in the 1-loop 1pi effective action .",
    "this contribution corresponds to a mass @xmath64 which exactly cancels the uv one @xmath65      the most relevant feature of ads space , for our discussion , is the presence of a ( conformal ) boundary located at @xmath66 in the poincar patch ( [ ads@xmath0 ] ) .",
    "one immediate consequence of the presence of a 2 + 1-dimensional boundary is that chiral symmetry is always broken in ads@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is fully analogous to what happens in a field theory on half of flat space : when a fermion travelling towards the boundary is reflected , the momentum flips sign , while @xmath68 is conserved .",
    "thus , helicity is not conserved .",
    "more formally , chiral symmetry is broken by the boundary conditions that are necessary to define the theory .",

    "the generalization to ads requires some care , because of the divergent scale factor at @xmath66 .",
    "the boundary conditions in this case can be derived by considering the behavior of the solutions close to @xmath66 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose @xmath75 .",
    "normalizability of the solution requires that @xmath76 and again chiral symmetry is necessarily broken .",
    "note that for the ads case , there is no freedom to chose the phase @xmath72 .",
    "this is basically because the bulk mass operator itself plays the rle of a boundary mass term .",
    "this is easily seen by performing a weyl rescaling , @xmath77 : the lagrangian for @xmath78 is just given by eq .",
    "( [ flat ] ) , but with a position dependent mass @xmath79 , which blows up at @xmath66 .",
    "the exponent in the asymptotic behavior is precisely the index @xmath23 of the corresponding representation .",
    "note that for @xmath80 , two inequivalent boundary conditions are possible , corresponding to a double quantization , as happens for scalars in ads @xcite .",
    "the existence of one and two solutions respectively for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , nicely matches eq .",
    "( [ fermion ] ) and the unitarity bound @xmath83 .    in the qed case ,",
    "the boundary condition ( [ adsfermion ] ) for a single charged spinor would break electric charge ; in order to conserve electric charge , the boundary conditions must relate @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "the charge preserving boundary condition is forced on us by normalizability . for @xmath86 ,",
    "compatibly with normalizability , there exist two other , inequivalent , charge - breaking boundary conditions .",
    "we will consider these other possibilities elsewhere .",

    "we can see that this is consistent with the equations of motion for the scalars : in the scalar sector , by solving the wave equation for the two mass eigenstates , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we find that @xmath91 for @xmath92 , normalizability alone implies that @xmath93 , corresponding to the first solution in eq .",

    "note that , as a combined effect of the boundary conditions for fermions and scalars , @xmath96symmetry is broken in the matter sector even for @xmath62 .",
    "finally , we can also fix the boundary condition for the vector multiplet . by taking neumann boundary conditions for the gauge field and acting with the supersymmetry transformations , we find that the appropriate sign of the gaugino boundary condition is @xmath97    to summarize , the presence of the boundary in ads@xmath0 always breaks chirality and @xmath96symmetry , even when there is no source of explicit breaking in the bulk action .",
    "the physics is essentially that of half of flat space .",
    "what is special to ads@xmath0 is that the chiral symmetry is broken , while the maximal number of isometries is preserved .",
    "this is , of course , crucial to give a meaning to a mass smaller than the curvature of the space .",
    "the boundary conditions derived above provide the necessary ` mass insertions ' to give rise to an ir contribution to the gaugino mass .",
    "focussing on the case of massless sqed , let us now compute the gaugino mass at 1-loop order .",
    "the computation is particularly transparent in the case of massless matter , where the chiral symmetry breaking is entirely due to the boundary effects .",

    "when @xmath62 , the chiral matter supermultiplet is conformally coupled . as a consequence , the full sqed action in this case is invariant under weyl transformations at the classical level .",

    "our result can however be readily interpreted from the viewpoint of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "even though lorentzian ads / cft is not nearly as developed as on euclidean space , we do not see obvious obstructions in the case at hand . from this perspective",

    ", we have the boundary effective action @xmath128 corresponding to the correlator of a dual fermionic current of scaling dimension @xmath129 : @xmath130 the 1-loop computation we have performed is directly translated into a 1-loop computation of the boundary effective action .",
    "the only difference from before is that we need to consider also solutions with euclidean boundary momenta @xmath131 . in this case",
    "the solution in the bulk corresponds to the unique regular solution at @xmath132 as prescribed by euclidean ads / cft .",
    "needless to say the previous computation can be continued to the euclidean region so that the self energy is diagonal on these solutions . working at 1-loop accuracy , the corrected boundary effective action",
    "is simply obtained by substituting the tree level bulk solution into the 1pi bulk effective action .",
    "however our previous result was precisely that the total ( uv + ir ) 1pi vanishes on the very solution of the massless dirac equation that satisfied the ads / cft boundary conditions at @xmath114 ( that is with the same exponent as in eq .",
    "( [ finite ] ) ) .",
    "thus we conclude that at the 1-loop level the boundary action is unaffected and thus the dimension of the cft operator dual to the gaugino field is not renormalized , consistently with supersymmetry .    what we have learned is an amusing lesson on the rle of the anomaly mediated gaugino mass .",
    "the basic reason for its existence is that ads@xmath0 behaves as 2 + 1-dimensional field theory as far as chirality is concerned .",
    "the mass of fermions is thus additively renormalized by calculable boundary effects . on the other hand",
    ", supersymmetry mandates the gaugino to be exactly massless .",
    "the simple sqed case , in the end , shows that the only way to achieve this is via the existence of suitable short distance effects , in one - to - one correspondence with the long distance effects .",
    "this is yet another illustration of the uv insensitivity of anomaly mediation .      in the previous section",
    "we have shown that the chiral breaking part in the 1-loop self energy does not correct the gaugino mass , nor , similarly , does it correct the boundary effective action . however , strictly speaking there is yet another contribution to the gaugino self - energy that we need to consider .",
    "this is the ` chirality - preserving ' contribution , @xmath133 , the one associated with wave - function renormalization .",
    "the issue at hand arises even in the absence of supersymmetry .",
    "we will show that this contribution vanishes when acting on a massless spinor .",
    "this result may seem obvious at first sight , based on our usual flat space intuition .",
    "indeed , in flat minkowsky space , lorentz invariance constrains this term to be proportional to @xmath134 , which vanishes on - shell as long as @xmath135 is not too singular ( in fact , @xmath135 is a logarithmic function ) .",
    "however , the situation is more subtle in ads , since , at the quantum level , the boundary makes itself felt even inside the bulk , and therefore the @xmath48 direction is not manifestly equivalent to the others .",
    "the purpose of this section is to clarify this issue .",
    "an extra complication comes from the need to regularize the divergent part of @xmath133 .",
    "we shall again focus on massless sqed , for which we can work in the conformally rescaled basis ( [ rescaling ] ) . the general case is briefly considered in the appendix . working in position space ,",

    "the counterterm needed to restore the symmetry must be local , and must of course involve the compensator . by simple reasoning one can quickly derive the unique form of this counterterm . in order to do so ,",
    "let us imagine that we had regulated the loop in a manifestly covariant fashion , by introducing pauli villars fields with mass @xmath141 .",
    "the crucial aspect of pauli - villars fields is that , being massive , their quadratic lagrangian depends directly on the compensator , @xmath146 , via the substitution @xmath147 which formally restores conformal invariance .",
    "however it does not make any sense to simply perform this replacement in eq .",
    "( [ reg ] ) . to find out how eq .",

    "@xmath150 . \\label{amwf}\\ ] ]    the local @xmath151 term gives the following correction to @xmath152 @xmath153 on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ reg ] ) the ` ir ' contribution to the equation of motion is @xmath154 to investigate how this non - local contribution affects the gaugino mass we must compute it on the solution @xmath117 of the massless wave equation specified by ( [ dirac4 ] ) . integrating by parts and using @xmath155 , eq .",
    "( [ nonlocwave ] ) becomes @xmath156 where the final integral is identical to the one computed in the previous section , eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) .",
    "again the last identity is only valid for solutions satisfying the hartle - hawking boundary conditions .",
    "we thus find that the contributions in eqs .",
    "( [ uv ] ) and ( [ ir ] ) again cancel so that the propagation of the gaugino is not affected .",
    "in particular the gaugino remains massless .",
    "note that , while the cancellation in the previous section relies on supersymmetry , this effect is independent of supersymmetry .",
    "this cancellation between uv and ir contributions , dictated by the ads isometry ( a subgroup of the conformal group ) , can be viewed as an @xmath157 counterpart of the one found previously .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as anomaly mediation is itself the supersymmetric counterpart of the trace anomaly . indeed , in a superfield formalism",
    ", these two separate cancellations would be manifestly related .",
    "we studied the rle played by anomaly mediated ( am ) mass terms in @xmath158 theories on ads@xmath0 with unbroken supersymmetry . for simplicity we focussed on the gaugino mass term in sqed with massless matter .",
    "we showed that the am gaugino mass term is required by the super - ads algebra in order to exactly cancel another 1-loop contribution , of infrared origin and associated with the ads boundary .",
    "the latter effect originates because chirality ( @xmath96symmetry in this case ) is necessarily broken by reflection at a 2 + 1-dimensional boundary .",
    "indeed , by computing first this finite ir effect ( which does not require the introduction of a regulator ) and by using the fact that the algebra dictates a massless gaugino , we could have argued the need for a local , uv generated , am contribution .",
    "since the latter is independent of whether the theory lives in flat or curved space , that would have provided yet another derivation of am gaugino masses .",
    "the possibility of relating the am mass to purely ir quantities illustrates the `` uv insensitivity '' of this effect , a property which makes it potentially relevant in phenomenological applications . the fact that am effects represent local parts of non - local structures in the 1pi action is well known . our result provides a new twist on that perspective",
    ": the am gaugino mass is just a reflection of the breakdown of chirality at the 2 + 1-d boundary of ads@xmath0 .",
    "there are several directions in which one might extend and improve our result .",
    "one obvious possibility is to perform the same computation in the non - abelian case , where , unlike in the abelian case , proper gauge - fixing will be needed .",
    "another problem concerns the rle of all other am terms , such as sfermion masses and  a - terms \" : it should be possible to derive them from consistency conditions as well , but probably in a more subtle way than for the gaugino mass .    in this paper we worked on the poincar patch .",
    "this procedure is clean for the euclidean case and from the ads / cft standpoint : our computation corresponds to checking that , as expected by supersymmetry , the scaling dimension of the operator dual to the gaugino field is not renormalized .",
    "the lorentzian computation is more delicate , as we have to deal with boundary conditions at the horizons which separate the chosen patch from the rest of ads",
    ". it would then be interesting to try to perform the same computation in global coordinates , and check that , in that case , the 1-loop self energy does vanish when convoluted with the normalizable solutions .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to understand the rle of anomaly mediation purely from the cft viewpoint .",
    "the ads bulk picture is that the gaugino must be massless even though chirality is broken , corresponding to non - vanishing @xmath121 off - shell . in the cft picture ,",
    "the non - vanishing of @xmath121 , shows up in the 4-point function of operators dual to the ads matter fields .",
    "however it is not immediately obvious how to translate the bulk picture to the boundary , since there is no notion of chirality in 2 + 1-d field theory .",
