    "determining the ground state of a many - body system is the most basic problem in many fields of science , such as condensed matter physics , nuclear physics and quantum chemistry .",
    "many numerical approaches have been developed so far to obtain the wavefunction . in the configuration interaction ( ci)@xcite ,",
    "multiple quasiparticle states are generated from a mean - field wavefunction and the coefficients for their linear combination are determined by solving an eigenvalue problem , while in the variational monte carlo ( vmc)@xcite , the quasiparticles are generated stochastically to obtain the expectation value of the total energy to be variationally determined . in the tensor network ( tn ) framework@xcite , the total energy is variationally determined using specific quasiparticle states generated according to an assumed tn . in those popular schemes , accessible degrees of freedom",
    "are usually not very large .",
    "this is particularly the case for ci albeit being the most versatile in that ci is free from the well - known negative sign problem of qmc and the dimensional restriction of the tensor network@xcite . in this view , extending the degrees of freedom accessible by ci is a very important problem .    in the field of quantum chemistry , the ci wavefunction of an @xmath1-electron system",
    "is expanded as @xmath2 in terms of the molecular orbitals ( mos ) @xmath3 , which are represented as a linear combination of the atomic orbitals ( aos ) @xmath4 , as @xmath5 using elements of an orthogonal matrix @xmath6 .",
    "the ci coefficients @xmath7 , which are elements of an antisymmetric tensor of order @xmath1@xcite and dimension @xmath8 , are varied to minimize the total energy and thus the full - ci calculation is , in practice , hampered by the degrees of freedom that grow combinatorially with @xmath1 .",
    "usually , the ci series is truncated to make the computation tractable ; however , when starting from the hartree - fock ( hf ) wavefunction by taking the permutation tensor @xmath9 in place of @xmath7 and the hartree - fock ( hf ) orbital @xmath10 in place of @xmath11 , the ci series usually converges very slowly@xcite",
    ". the convergence does not , in general , speed up drastically even when starting from multiple slater determinants . instead",
    ", use of localized mos in place of the canonical hf orbitals is known to be effective for this purpose@xcite , and , recently , significant speed - up was achieved by using non - orthonormal slater determinants comprised of non - orthonormal mos that augment the hf orbitals@xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that ci can be made more practicable by using optimal mos for this purpose .    apart from ci , the many - body perturbation theory such as the coupled cluster ( cc)@xcite has been developed to collect infinite correction terms , thereby enabling the correction of the total energy of the water molecule , for example , within the error of 0.53 mhartree by taking up to triple excitations ( ccsdt ) . however , the computational cost scales as @xmath12 , which is still prohibitively high for application to many systems of interest .",
    "thus , accelerating the convergence of the ci series should open up the possibility to treat , with unprecedented accuracy , a whole new class of problems in electronic structure theory of strongly correlated systems .",
    "the key to the development that we present here is in a compact representation of the antisymmetric tensor @xmath7 . with this in mind , we proposed in our previous work@xcite to represent @xmath13 as a product of @xmath9 and a symmetric tensor @xmath14 and then to decompose the latter into a series of kronecker products of a set of vectors such that@xmath15 such decomposition of an order-@xmath1 tensor into a linear combination of rank-@xmath16 tensors is known in the literature as the canonical decomposition@xcite or the parallel factor decomposition@xcite . in our approach , which we call the symmetric tensor decomposition ci ( std - ci ) , variational parameters are the set of vectors @xmath17 and the orthogonal matrix @xmath6 and thus the degrees of freedom are @xmath18 . the number of order-@xmath16 tensors ( i.e. , the rank of the tensor decomposition @xmath19@xcite ) , was found to be relatively few for small molecules ( h@xmath20 , he@xmath20 , and lih ) and the hubbard tetramer ( fig . 1 - 4 ) .",
    "this suggests effectiveness of the tensor decomposition in compactly describing the wavefunction with a rapidly converging series ( std series ) when the molecular orbitals are optimized together .",
    "note that each term in the std series contains all possible slater determinants , which means that all the terms of the ci series are regrouped differently to form different terms of the std series .",
    "the computational cost thereby required is proportional to @xmath21 when using the algorithm to handle the permutation tensor developed in ref.@xcite , so that the effectiveness of std - ci depends on the the rank of the decomposition @xmath19 required to accurately express the wavefunction .",
    "when applied to larger systems , however , we have found that the rank @xmath19 needed for sufficient convergence is increased in general .",
    "in addition , the computation suffers from loss of significance in the floating - point arithmetic as will be shown below .",
    "therefore , an improvement in the tensor decomposition is clearly desirable .    in this context",
    ", one may use a more elaborate tensor decomposition , such as the tensor train network ( ttn ) suitable for one - dimensional systems@xcite or the projected entangled pair states ( peps ) extended to two - dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "indeed , the former approach was applied to several molecular systems@xcite . however ,",
    "here we take a different approach : within the canonical decomposition technique , the degrees of freedom are extended by using different non - orthonormal mo coefficients for different terms in the std series .",
    "that is , we use a general complex matrix @xmath22 for the mo coefficient although it was described as @xmath23 in the original std - ci scheme , extending thereby the degrees of freedom to @xmath24",
    ". we will call our new scheme the extended std ( estd ) . as will be shown below",
    ", each term in the std series corresponds to a different hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) wavefunction@xcite . since the hfb wavefunction is called alternatively the antisymmetrized geminal power ( agp)@xcite , estd",
    "may also be referred to as a linear combination of agp .",
    "the agp wavefunction has been used for variational calculations in a different context . in quantum chemistry , a single agp ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) has been used as the trial wavefunction to obtain the potential energy surface of small molecules@xcite . in variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculations , single agp@xcite or multi - agp@xcite",
    "is multiplied by a correlation factor of the jastrow type to form a jastrow - agp ( jagp ) trial wavefunction ; the optimization is done only for the jastrow parameters with the mo  coefficients kept unchanged from the initial hf orbitals or the initial natural orbitals constructed by performing a small preparatory ci calculation . in nuclear physics , multi - quasiparticle states are generated from a single agp and are linearly combined to describe the wavefunction . this computational scheme is called the generator coordinate method ( gcm)@xcite .",
    "the total - energy scheme of gcm was formulated by onishi and yoshida@xcite , and the mathematical structure was studied recently by other groups@xcite .",
    "contrary to those earlier works , we fully optimize the mo coefficients in our estd scheme without introducing the correlation factor . in the present scheme , we use an algorithm to decompose the permutation tensor into products of the second order permutation tensors allowing thereby to reduce the computational scaling to @xmath26 .",
    "contrary to std - ci , this scheme does not require orthonormalization of aos so that one can take advantage of the ao basis that is spatially localized and chemically comprehensible",
    ". we will show below that the std series can be drastically shortened for the h@xmath27o molecule and hubbard tetramers .",
    "this may open up the possibility to interpret strongly correlated systems in terms of mos . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the outline of our formalism .",
    "we restrict our study to systems with even number of electrons throughout this paper .",
    "in the original std - ci , we have applied the canonical decomposition to the symmetric part of the ci  coefficient ( eq .  ( [ std ] ) ) , so that the wavefunction eq .",
    "( [ cimo ] ) is rewritten using eq .",
    "( [ moao ] ) as@xmath28 with the ci coefficient becoming @xmath29 where @xmath19 is the rank of the symmetric tensor decomposition and @xmath30 is a set of complex vectors .",
    "we will take the convention for the subscript such that @xmath31 correspond to mos and @xmath32 to aos . in the extended std - ci ( estd ) , we expand the degrees of freedom by replacing the product @xmath23 with a general complex matrix @xmath33 such that @xmath34 using the fact that the permutation tensor of order @xmath1 for even @xmath1 can be decomposed into a product of the second order permutation tensors as@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the symmetric group of degree @xmath1 and @xmath37 is the antisymmetrizer , eq .",

    "contrary to standard gcm schemes , we explicitly obtain the coefficient of @xmath42 in eqs.([gcm1]-[gcm5 ] ) instead of using the particle projection method@xcite .",
    "a similar projection method@xcite can be applied to the hfb state to adapt the wavefunction to the spatial and spin symmetries , which is necessary to obtain accurate ground state wavefunctions , but we do not use it in the present study to compare estd and full - ci without the symmetry adaptation .",
