    "the one - loop effective action in a background field is an important quantity in quantum field theory @xcite . in gauge theories ,",
    "the one - loop effective action has been calculated exactly and analytically only for certain very special gauge field backgrounds , such as those with constant ( or , in non - abelian theories , covariantly constant ) field strength , based on the seminal work of heisenberg and euler @xcite , and schwinger @xcite ; and for some very special one - dimensional cases where the field is inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend further the class of background fields for which we can compute the renormalized one - loop effective action .",
    "we are particularly interested in studying the small fermion mass limit , motivated by its importance for chiral physics , and also by the fact that while the large mass limit is well understood @xcite , much less is known about the small mass limit for general gauge backgrounds .",
    "recently , a new approach has been developed for computing exactly , but numerically , the gauge theory effective action in a class of background fields that permit a separation of variables reducing to a set of one - dimensional operators .",
    "this has been explored in most detail for radially separable backgrounds , where the method has been called the `` partial - wave cutoff method '' @xcite .",
    "the first application of this method was to the full mass dependence of the quark determinant in an instanton background , yielding a smooth interpolation between the known large and small mass extreme limits @xcite .",
    "subsequent papers have concentrated on scalar theories . indeed ,",
    "even the instanton background computation made use of a special property of self - dual backgrounds that implies that the spinor effective action can be expressed directly in terms of the scalar effective action @xcite . here , in this paper , we present the spinor approach without assuming self - duality of the background gauge field .",
    "the basic idea of the `` partial - wave cutoff method '' is simple : the one - loop effective action requires the logarithm of the determinant of an operator , and there is a simple method [ known as the gelfand - yaglom method @xcite ] for computing the determinant of an _ ordinary _ differential operator , without computing its eigenvalues . for a _ partial _ differential operator , if the problem is separable down to a set of _ ordinary _ differential operators , we can formally sum over the gelfand - yaglom results for each term in the separation sum .",
    "the technical difficulty is that this sum is naively divergent , and this must be addressed by a suitable regularization and renormalization .",
    "this has been resolved in previous publications for gauge theories with scalars and for self - interacting scalar theories .",
    "here we show how this works for spinor theories with background gauge fields that are radially separable , and not necessarily self - dual .    while this class of radially separable backgrounds is large , and includes important special cases such as instantons , monopoles and vortices , there are of course many other physically important background fields that are not separable in this way . in these cases",
    "we must resort to approximation methods in order to compute the effective action . in order to investigate the region of validity of these approximations ,",
    "we compare our exact numerical results with two such approximations , the large mass expansion and the derivative expansion , and show that for spinor theories a new feature arises when evaluating the derivative expansion approximation for light fermions .",
    "we begin with a chiral decomposition of the effective action .",
    "the euclidean one - loop effective action in spinor qed is the logarithm of the determinant of the corresponding dirac operator : @xmath0 = -\\ln \\ , \\det\\left ( \\displaystyle{\\not } d+m",
    "\\right ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\,\\det\\left(-\\displaystyle{\\not } d^2 + m^2\\right ) \\label{oneloop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is the dirac operator in euclidean 4-dimensional spacetime , and @xmath2 is the classical background gauge field .",
    "we will use the following standard representation for the @xmath3 dirac matrices in euclidean spacetime @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and the @xmath6 are the @xmath7 pauli matrices . using this dirac algebra representation",
    "we see clearly the chiral decomposition : @xmath8 where we have defined @xmath9 thus , we write @xmath0 & = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\,\\det\\left ( m^2+d d^\\dagger \\right ) -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\,\\det\\left ( m^2+d^\\dagger d   \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\gamma^{(+)}[a]+\\gamma^{(-)}[a ] \\label{sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for later use , we recall the familiar properties of the @xmath10 matrices : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the t hooft tensors @xcite .    now we make the following simple observation , that we can write the renormalized effective action as @xmath14 & = & 2\\gamma^{(\\pm)}_{\\rm ren}[a ] \\mp\\left(\\gamma^{(+)}_{\\rm ren}[a]-\\gamma^{(-)}_{\\rm ren}[a]\\right ) \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , we know that the difference of the renormalized effective action for the two chiralities takes a special form , related to the chiral anomaly : @xmath15 & \\equiv & \\left(\\gamma^{(+)}_{\\rm ren}[a]-\\gamma^{(-)}_{\\rm ren}[a]\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^2}\\ln \\left(\\frac{m^2}{\\mu^2}\\right)\\int d^4 x\\ , f_{\\mu\\nu } f^*_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{difference}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , to evaluate the spinor effective action it is sufficient to evaluate the effective action for just one of the chiralities . that is , we can compute either @xmath16 or @xmath17 , but we do not need to compute both @xcite .",
    "this is a useful observation because there exist background fields for which the computation is significantly easier for one chirality than for the other .",
    "for example , if the background field is self - dual then @xmath18 , since @xmath19 is anti - self - dual .",
    "therefore the positive chirality operator reduces to the scalar klein - gordon operator : @xmath20 which implies that @xmath21=-2 \\gamma_{\\rm scalar}[a]-\\delta\\gamma[a ] \\label{spsc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this familiar result enables the computation of the quark determinant in an instanton background via the associated scalar determinant , which has a partial - wave decomposition @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a special class of background gauge fields that are not self - dual , but for which the dirac operator still admits a partial wave decomposition @xcite . before coming to the radial decomposition",
    ", we first note that these gauge fields admit a simple chiral decomposition . specifically , we consider gauge fields of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the t hooft symbols @xcite , and @xmath24 is a radial profile function , to be specified below .",
    "this type of background field is symmetric under @xmath25 transformations , leading to a partial wave decomposition @xcite .",
    "this decomposition applies for any radial profile function @xmath24 , so we have the freedom to study a wide class of background fields .",
    "in particular , we can investigate the role of zero modes , the presence or absence of which depends on the form of @xmath24 .",
    "the associated field strength tensor is @xmath26 note that this field strength is not self - dual , due to the presence of the term proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the positive chirality operator @xmath28 does not simplify as in ( [ kg ] ) .",
    "however , for this field the negative chirality operator does take a particularly simple form : @xmath29 this is diagonal in spinor degrees of freedom , so if we work in the negative chirality sector , then we can immediately use our previous results for scalar klein - gordon operators @xcite , just by including an extra `` potential '' equal to @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath31   \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & m^2+\\mathcal{h}_{(l , l_3 , s)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantum number @xmath32 takes half - integer values : @xmath33 , while @xmath34 ranges from @xmath35 to @xmath32 , in integer steps . in this way , we compute @xmath36 $ ] , and then the full spinor effective action can then be obtained using ( [ choice ] ) and ( [ difference ] ) .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the partial - wave cutoff method developed previously for radially separable fields of the form ( [ a ] ) , adapted to the negative chirality sector of the spinor theory using ( [ negative ] ) .",
    "the basic idea of the partial - wave cutoff method involves separating the sum over the the quantum number @xmath32 into a low partial - wave contribution , each term of which is computed using the ( numerical ) gelfand - yaglom method , and a high partial - wave contribution , whose sum is computed analytically using a wkb expansion .",
    "the regularization and renormalization procedure tells us how to combine these two contributions to yield the finite and renormalized effective action @xcite .",
    "the low partial - wave contribution for our system is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an arbitrary angular momentum cutoff .",
    "the factor @xmath39 is the degeneracy factor , and the @xmath40 sum comes from adding the contributions of each spinor component in . in order to evaluate this quantity",
    ", we use the gelfand - yaglom method , which we now briefly review ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote two second - order radial differential operators on the interval @xmath43 and let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be solutions to the following initial value problem : @xmath46 then the ratio of the determinants is given by @xmath47 in the negative chirality sector we can take , @xmath48 , and @xmath42 to be the corresponding free operator : i.e , the same operator with the background field set to zero : @xmath49 .",

    "the value of @xmath52 at @xmath53 gives us the value of the determinant for that partial wave .",
    "in fact , the corresponding free equation is analytically soluble .",
    "it is numerically more convenient to define @xmath54 and solve numerically the corresponding initial value problem for @xmath55 , as explained in @xcite . then the contribution of the low - angular - momentum partial - waves to the effective action is @xmath56 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while each term in the sum over @xmath32 is finite and simple to compute , the sum over @xmath32 is divergent as @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , only after adding the renormalized contribution of the high partial - wave modes do we obtain a finite and renormalized result for the effective action .",
    "the high partial - wave contribution for our system is given by @xmath58 again , since by ( [ negative ] ) we only need the negative chirality sector , and the negative chirality sector diagonalizes fully , we can apply our previous scalar analysis to each of the diagonal components , adding the appropriate term @xmath59 to the klein - gordon operator .",
    "this modifies the detailed expressions as follows . in the large @xmath38 limit",
    ", we have @xmath60   \\bigg ] \\\\ & + \\frac{r^3 ( 20 g(r)^2 + 10 g(r)g'(r)r + g'(r)^2 r^2 ) } { 12 } \\bigg [ \\gamma + 2   \\ln",
