    "the scope of quantum information theory is to determine how and how much information can be stored , processed , and transmitted through physical systems behaving according to the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite . in particular , one is interested in transmitting classical or quantum information , possibly in the presence of physical constraints ( e.g. , limited energy of bandwidth ) or additional resources ( e.g. , quantum entanglement or feedback communication ) @xcite .    in the most common setting ,",
    "one is given a quantum communication channel , that is , a physical process that transforms quantum states at the input into quantum states at the output , as for example an optical fiber does , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a channel of this kind is also called a quantum - quantum ( qq ) channel .",
    "another kind of channel is the so - called classical - quantum ( cq ) channel , which maps classical states ( that is , probability distribution over a set of symbols ) into quantum states . to send classical information through a qq channel , the sender ( alice )",
    "first encodes classical states into quantum states by applying a suitable cq channel at the input of the qq channel , as represented in figure [ fig_schemes]a ) . in this setting",
    ", the cq channel plays the role of an encoding map . at the other end of the qq channel , the receiver ( bob )",
    "collects the output and measures it to decode the classical information sent by alice .",
    "quantum reading ( qr ) is a communication protocol that is based on a different rationale @xcite .",
    "instead of having a given communication channel and encoding classical information by choosing the input states , in qr the sender encodes information by choosing an element from a collection of qq channels .",
    "then , to decode , the receiver probes the qq channels with a quantum states , collects the output and measures it .",
    "the prototypical example of qr is that of an optical memory , e.g. a cd or dvd , where information is encoded in a memory cell by means of the physical properties of the substrate , e.g. , its reflectivity or phase . for this reason",
    ", qr has been mainly considered in the context of optical realizations @xcite .",
    "for example , a memory cell with low or high reflectivity may encode a logical `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' . to read this information the receiver must shine a laser beam on the memory cell , and the collect the reflected beam ( see figure [ fig_qread ] ) .",
    "there are proven advantages in using quantum states of light to perform this task , for instance increased fidelity and data density , reduced energy consumption and dissipation @xcite .    from a more abstract point of view",
    ", qr can be represented as shown in figure [ fig_schemes]b ) .",
    "the encoding of a symbol @xmath0 belonging to an alphabet @xmath1 can be modeled as a control - qq channel ( a generalization of a control - unitary channel @xcite ) where the value of @xmath0 determines which of the qq channel in a set @xmath2 should be applied .    following",
    "@xcite we refer to the set @xmath2 as a `` memory cell '' .",
    "one can define the _ quantum reading capacity _ of @xmath3 as the maximum rate ( in bits per use of the memory cell ) that can be reliably transmitted from the sender to the receiver using the encoding procedure specified by @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , in previous works several notions of capacity have been defined according to which constraints are assumed or additional resources are allowed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present further results concerning quantum reading capacities , in particular we show that qr capacity is super - additive , and discuss under which conditions the assistance of entanglement enhances the qr capacity .    the paper proceeds as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : review ] we review a few basic notions and definitions . in section",
    "[ sec : nless ] we analyze the case of noiseless qr .",
    "the property of super - additivity of qr is discussed in section [ sec : supera ] , and the case of noisy qr is considered in section [ sec : noisy ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : zero ] is devoted to zero - error qr capacity , and section [ sec : end ] is for conclusions .",
    "a qr protocol comprises an encoding and a decoding stage . during the encoding stage , which is essentially classical , the sender alice encodes messages @xmath4 using codewords of length @xmath5 , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "each codeword identifies a corresponding sequence of quantum channels from the memory cell @xmath8 , e.g. , @xmath9 . during the decoding stage ,",
    "the receiver bob prepares a state @xmath10 , also called a transmitter , which is used to probe the sequence of quantum channels @xmath11 .",
    "finally , bob collects and measures the output to retrieve the encoded message .    in analogy with other quantum communication protocol",
    "we introduce the following definitions .",
    "a @xmath12-qr protocol for a memory cell @xmath2 is defined by an encoding map @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , a transmitter state @xmath10 , and a measurement with povm elements @xmath16 , such that the average probability of error in decoding is less than @xmath17 , that is , @xmath18",
    "\\leq \\epsilon \\ , .\\ ] ] the rate of the qr protocol is @xmath19 .",
    "the qr capacity of a given memory cell @xmath3 is defined as @xmath20 where the @xmath21 is over all sequences of @xmath22-qr protocols .",
    "we now introduce some notions of constrained qr capacities . instead of considering a generic state for the transmitter",
    ", we can restrict to the family of qr protocols for which the transmitter has the form , @xmath23 , that is , it is a separable state across different uses of the memory cell .",
    "the maximum qr rate that can be achieved under this constraint is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the maximum qr rate achievable for a given @xmath27 . applying known results of quantum information theory @xcite ,",
    "the latter can be expressed as : @xmath28 where the maximum is over all probability distribution over the alphabet @xmath1 , @xmath29 is the holevo information , and @xmath30 denotes the von neumann entropy . it can be easily shown that the maximum is indeed obtained when @xmath27 is a pure state @xcite .",
    "similarly we can define the qr capacities @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , where the transmitter state is separable across pairs , triplets , etc .",
    ", of different uses of the memory cell , that is , @xmath33 ( for @xmath5 multiple of @xmath34 ) .",
    "we have @xmath35 clearly @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "if the inequality is strict , that is , @xmath38 for some @xmath34 , we say that the @xmath39 is super - additive .",
    "more generally , the transmitter state can be chosen to be entangled with an ancilla , which bob retains and measures jointly , see figure [ qr_ea ] . in this case",
    "we speak of entanglement - assisted qr .",
    "notice that an entanglement - assisted qr protocol for a memory cell @xmath40 is equivalent to an unassisted protocol for the extended memory cell @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the identity channel acting on the ancilla .",
    "the entanglement - assisted qr capacity is hence given by the expression @xmath43 similarly , we can define the assisted qr capacities @xmath44 by constraining the transmitter to be separable across groups of @xmath34 uses of the memory cell .",
    "clearly , we have @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . if , for some value of @xmath34 , this inequality is strict we say that the assistance of entanglement enhances the qr capacity @xmath31 of the memory cell .",
    "we first consider a noiseless setting in which the qq channels in the memory cell are unitary transformations , that is , @xmath47 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider the binary setting , @xmath48 , with the unitaries acting in a finite - dimensional hilbert space of dimension @xmath49 .",

    "this is equivalent to maximizing the von neuman entropy of the state @xmath54 . in order to do that",

    "we can repeat the reasoning of above with @xmath66 replaced by @xmath74 .",
    "notice that @xmath74 has the same eigenvalues of @xmath66 ( but with higher multiplicity ) .",

    "according to @xcite , two unitaries , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , can always be perfectly discriminated , if enough copies of them are provided and using a suitable input state and , possibly , a collective measurement . to relate in a formal way this feature of the problem of unitary discrimination with qr ,",
    "we need to consider the notion of zero - error qr capacity .    a @xmath142 zero - error qr protocol for a memory cell @xmath2 is defined by an encoding map @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , a transmitter state @xmath10 , and a measurement with povm elements @xmath16 , such that the average probability of error in decoding is zero .",
