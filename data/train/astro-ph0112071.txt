    "efforts to understand the origin of cosmic rays at any energy are greatly hampered by our lack of knowledge of the mass distribution in the incoming cosmic ray beam .",
    "the determination of the arrival direction of cosmic rays does not depend on knowledge of the mass of the primary and , using the fluorescence technique , the primary energy is obtainable with only a small systematic uncertainty because of the unknown mass . even with the traditional ground arrays it has been possible to devise ways of deducing the primary energy that are reasonably independent of model and mass uncertainties , at least at the 30 % level .",
    "however use of the data on the energy spectrum and arrival direction distribution to decide between various origin models does require knowledge of the primary mass distribution .",
    "while there is a common assumption that protons dominate at the highest energies , hard experimental evidence is lacking , as it is at energies above 10@xmath2 ev .    some models of cosmic ray origin lead to the conclusion that photons dominate the cosmic ray beam .",
    "this hypothesis can be more readily tested than can competing hypotheses that advocate protons or iron nuclei as the majority primaries .",
    "this is because the shower development of a photon primary is very different from that of any hadronic primary .",
    "the difference is larger than is expected between the showers created by proton and iron primaries .",
    "for example , halzen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that a photon is extremely unlikely to produce a shower in the atmosphere that has a development profile that looks like the famous event of @xmath7 ev observed by the fly s eye group @xcite .",
    "a study of horizontal showers recorded at haverah park has shown that at 10@xmath8 ev there can be no more than 40 % of the primaries that are photons @xcite , while a search , using the traditional idea of photon showers being deficient in muons , has given a similar limit at the same energy @xcite .",
    "these analyses all assume that photons @xmath9 10@xmath8 ev have not acquired hadron - like properties , as has sometimes been speculated .",
    "there is no reliable evidence on the hadronic mass composition above 10@xmath8 ev .",
    "some years ago an analysis of the fly s eye data @xcite pointed to a change from an iron - dominated composition at @xmath10 ev to a proton - dominated composition near 10@xmath8 ev .",
    "this conclusion was drawn from a study of the variation of depth of maximum with energy ( the elongation rate ) and from an analysis of the spread in depth of maximum at a given energy .",
    "the elongation rate behaviour was in agreement with an earlier , model - independent , analysis from haverah park @xcite and with a related study using cherenkov light by the yakutsk group @xcite .",
    "the conclusions on mass composition from the study of the spread in depth of maximum were confirmed by @xcite but none of these analyses extended to energies above 10@xmath8 ev .",
    "a different conclusion has been reached by the agasa group based on the variation of the muon content of showers with energy @xcite .",
    "their analysis favours a composition that remains mixed over the 10@xmath2 to 10@xmath8 ev decade .",
    "furthermore there is a difference between the conclusions reached from the data on depth of maximum from the fly s eye experiment @xcite and those reached from the hires prototype , operated with the mia detector , in the range 10@xmath11 to 10@xmath2  ev @xcite .",
    "the more recent data are used to infer protons as early as 10@xmath2 ev , if the qgsjet model@xcite is correct .",
    "there is a good evidence from haverah park data @xcite that the qgsjet model is satisfactory , at least to 10@xmath2 ev . however the hires / mia conclusion is , in turn , in contradiction with a new analysis of haverah park data @xcite that suggests that protons make up only 34 % of the flux , independent of the energy , between @xmath10 and @xmath12 ev , with iron nuclei making up the remainder .",
    "the addition of more data in recent years and a better understanding of what might be the optimum shower model has not helped to clarify the position : rather the reverse . in figure [ xmax ]",
    "we show a compilation of data on depth of maximum , @xmath13 , as a function of energy @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of a conclusion to the choice of model is evident .",
    "the matter is thus far from being resolved and there is clearly scope for alternative approaches .",
    "it seems unlikely that a single method of deriving the mass composition will be sufficient to resolve this important issue . in this paper",
    "we argue for a new approach that is based on the study of inclined showers , and which can be added to the armoury that can be used .",
    "the method is derived from the work that led to our estimate @xcite of a limit to the photon flux at 10@xmath8 ev , an estimate that has now been confirmed independently @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "our approach stems from the detailed understanding of the propagation of inclined showers that has been developed @xcite and from its application to the prediction of the rate of triggering of the haverah park array @xcite .",
    "inclined showers induced by very high energy cosmic rays produce particle densities at ground level which are dominantly due to muons , in contrast to vertical showers that have an important component due to photons and electrons stemming from @xmath14 decay .",
    "measurements of the cosmic ray rate at different zenith gives a handle on the relative number of muons in a shower , which is dependent on composition .",
    "to find the photon limit we assumed that the energy spectrum was known , and calibrated in a mass - independent way , through the work with the fly s eye detector . using this known vertical spectrum , a prediction was made of the number of showers expected with energies above 10@xmath8 ev for photon , proton and iron primaries .",
    "we found strong evidence to reject a photon intensity at the level predicted by several super - heavy relic models @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "recent reassessment of the energy spectrum in the appropriate range @xcite , and the differences reported between the agasa group and the hires group @xcite,@xcite , make it premature to be too firmly in favour of protons or iron above 10@xmath8 ev , but our conclusion about photons remains robust . an extensive description of our method used to derive the photon limit has been given recently @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how the technique can be used to infer the mass at energies between 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath8 ev .",
    "the conclusions , as to the mass variation with energy that we can presently draw , is constrained by uncertainties in the form of the spectrum in this energy range , and by the assumed hadronic interaction model , rather than by statistical limitations .",
    "we pressent conclusions for a number of spectra , using the qgsjet model @xcite as a reference for hadronic interactions , in the expectation that the spectrum uncertainties will soon be resolved .",
    "the analysis of showers with zenith angles @xmath9 60@xmath15 is not straightforward , even with an array like haverah park in which the detectors were deep - water cherenkov detectors .",
    "these detectors present a significant area to inclined showers by comparison with thin scintillators .",
    "there are two major difficulties .",
    "firstly the showers lose their near - circular symmetry very rapidly above 60@xmath15 @xcite and , secondly , the finite size of the array makes it difficult to locate the core . during the operational phase of the haverah park array ( 1967 -1987 ) a decision was made to ignore events @xmath9 60@xmath15 for these reasons .",
    "more recently , with the advent of the analytical techniques of ave _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and with the availability of much more computing power , it has proved possible to get accurate directions for the events , to estimate their energies ( subject to assumptions about shower models ) and to compute the flux . in this section",
    "we justify these claims .",
    "the methods of finding the directions and of calculating the energy are described in detail in @xcite for events above 10@xmath8 ev .",
    "here we have applied the same techniques , namely an iterative process in which arrival directions are fitted to the time distributions , followed by shower energy and core position fits to the detector densities .",
    "the timing of the signals use the information on core position to account for curvature corrections .",
    "following the same steps as described in @xcite , we have performed three quality cuts to eliminate uncertainties in the reconstruction procedure : ( i ) the distance from the central triggering detector to the core position in the shower plane is required to be below @xmath16  m , ( ii ) the @xmath17 probability for the energy and direction fits must be @xmath9 1 % , ( iii ) the downward error in the energy determination is required to be less than a factor of 2 . the chosen value of @xmath18 guarantees that the core position is always close to the triggering detectors in the array . similar results , but with reduced statistics , was obtained with @xmath19  m. this last cut is the only one that differs from those used in @xcite : it ensures that the smaller showers , that are the concern of this paper , are near to sufficient detectors to allow reliable density fits . after making the cuts described above we found 385 events with @xmath20  ev and 2 events with @xmath21  ev .    again mimicking the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have generated a sample of artificial events to which we have applied the same reconstruction algorithms as used for the data . in figure [ chis ] we show the normalised @xmath17 distributions for the timing fit to the 385 events above 10@xmath2 ev and for the energy estimates made , assuming proton primaries .",
    "the match between the real data and artificial data generated using the spectrum description given in @xcite ( from here on nw ) , and assuming proton primaries , is reassuring .",
    "we argue that these plots show that we have developed a good understanding of the techniques needed to analyse the directions and energies of very inclined showers .",
    "the energy resolution for events above 10@xmath2 ev is shown in figure [ energycomp ] for two energy bands .",
    "the energy error for the artificial events is the difference between the reconstructed energy @xmath22 and that of the simulated shower @xmath23 .",
    "the rms spread in the relative errors for the artificial events are 0.43 and 0.40 : we note the tail towards higher energies in the lower energy band .",
    "the energy error in the data is obtained by combining in quadrature the error obtained from the maximum likelihood analysis and the error associated with the uncertainty in the zenith angle reconstruction . in figure [ errors ] we show the upward and downward error distributions for the real data as compared with the artificial events , again generated with the nw spectrum and proton primaries . again the agreement is very satisfactory .    in figure [ zendist ] the zenith angle distribution for events above 10@xmath2 ev is compared to real data using the nw ( proton ) spectrum to make the prediction .",
    "this comparison is similar to that made in our earlier work @xcite but we have now developed methods to estimate the energy , most importantly including zero density measurements in the energy reconstruction fits @xcite .",
    "here we see a difference between the predictions and the data .",
    "note that the data are not normalised .",
    "the fact that the predicted rate is above the artificial rate indicates that we are using ( i ) a spectrum with fluxes that are too high , or ( ii ) the wrong mass composition , or ( iii ) an incorrect hadronic interaction model .",
    "of course a combination of all these uncertainties can also be involved .",
    "we have studied how different assumptions about the shape of primary spectrum affect the expected rates of inclined showers for both pure proton and pure iron samples .    in figure [ fluxes ]",
    "we show a compilation of cosmic ray data for energies above 10@xmath11 ev together with various parameterizations of the energy spectrum .",
    "the agasa @xcite , monocular hires ( hires 1 and hires 2 @xcite ) , hires - mia @xcite , haverah park @xcite and flyseye stereo @xcite spectral measurements are as reported by the different groups . for the purposes of this work",
    "we have taken four recent parameterizations of the spectra represented by the lines in fig .",
    "[ fluxes ] : the spectra attributed to nagano and watson @xcite , the one obtained by szabelski _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( both of these are syntheses of various data sets ) , the parameterization given by hires experiment @xcite , and a parameterization based on a recent analysis of the haverah park data @xcite . we have not used the recently reported agasa spectrum @xcite which starts above 3 x 10@xmath2 ev .    in figures [ nw],[sza],[hp],[hi ] we show the sensitivity of the inferred variation of mass for reasons explained later with energy to the different input spectra . while from the szabelski _",
    "input we find a mass spectrum that is iron dominated over the whole energy range ( 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath8 ev ) , with the nw spectrum one would argue for a proton dominated composition .",
    "however if we take the recently revised haverah park spectrum @xcite we find that the mean mass lies between proton and iron near 10@xmath2 ev and possibly gets heavier as we move to energies close to 10@xmath8  ev .",
    "we note that the mean mass at the differential energy point at @xmath12 ev is @xmath24 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn with the hires spectrum as an input . in the energy decade below 2",
    "x 10@xmath2 ev we have recently argued that @xmath25 , assuming a bi - modal mass composition of proton and iron @xcite .    comparing the measured data to the corresponding predictions assuming an iron only spectrum and a proton only spectrum , it is straight forward to obtain the fraction of protons in a dual mass compositon model . in figure",
    "[ ratio ] the variation with energy of the predicted fraction of protons in the cosmic ray beam is plotted for the four spectra . in this figure , above 10@xmath8 ev , we have included events with less stringent quality cuts ( @xmath26  km ) , as used in @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently high energies , the number of detectors with signals increases substantially for any surface array and this allows the relaxation of the condition , while retaining reasonably constrained fits .",
    "there are large uncertainties , but a trend towards a light composition at energies above the ankle is apparent with all spectra used .",
    "we note also that if the true flux is like that in the recent analysis presented by agasa @xcite , the inclined shower data would be inconsistent with even a dominantly iron composition because the predicted rate would exceed the observed rate .",
    "a heavier mass primary composition would be required .",
    "we believe that we have demonstrated the potential of a new method for extracting the mass spectrum above 10@xmath2 ev by studying cosmic rays at high zenith angles .",
    "it is based on the difference in abundance of muons with respect to photons and electrons for different primaries .",
    "we are not making strong claims for the finality of our conclusions ( see fig . [ ratio ] ) about mass composition .",
    "a definitive statement awaits a better understanding of the differences between different energy spectra above this energy and an exploration of the sensitivity of the method to different models of particle interactions .",
    "this technique can be extended to very high energies and , assuming the interaction model is understood , we would expect to be able to extract the mass spectrum in the range 10@xmath8 to 10@xmath27 ev with data from the pierre auger observatory .",
