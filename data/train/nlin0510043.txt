    "clearly , to compute @xmath3 given @xmath2 , we need the local function , and finite number of its derivatives . in this",
    "talk we investigate whether the equations for fluid flows is local or not .",
    "fluid flows are described by navier - stokes ( ns ) equation , continuity equation , and the equation of state given below:@xmath4 where @xmath5 are the velocity , pressure , and density field respectively . @xmath6is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "we nondimensionalize the above equations by scaling the quantities appropriately , e. g. , divide @xmath7 by velocity scale @xmath8 .",
    "navier - stokes equation gets modified to    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the length scale , and @xmath11 is the sound speed .",
    "if the sound speed @xmath12 and @xmath13 are finite , then we can find @xmath14 and @xmath15 given @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( assuming that @xmath18,@xmath17 , and their first and second derivatives are finite ) . for typical flows @xmath13 is finite , so for finite @xmath12 , navier - stokes equation is local in real space .",
    "note that the disturbances propagate with the sound speed .",
    "the larger the sound speed , larger the range of influence per unit time .",
    "still the influence moves locally as long as the sound speed is finite .",
    "when the sound speed is infinite , then disturbances can propagate instantaneously , and all parts of the system starts interacting ; hence the system becomes nonlocal .",
    "hence , the equations for fluid flows become nonlocal when the sound speed is infinite , which is the case for incompressible fluids @xmath19 .",
    "the speed of propagation is infinite in newton s law of gravitation as well as in coulomb s interactions between the charged particles .",
    "these are some other examples of nonlocal interactions in physics .",
    "we can abstract the above physics using a 2d mesh of spring - mass system . for finite spring constant ,",
    "the disturbance propagates with a finite speed , and the physics is local . when the spring constant is very large , the physics is still local , but the range of propagation per unit time becomes quite large . here",
    "mass is pulled - pushed by local spring only ( 4 of them ) . when the spring constant become infinite",
    ", then whole system behaves like a solid and the speed of propagation becomes infinite .",
    "this system has nonlocal interactions ; the movement of the mass at a point is affected by masses and springs at large distances .",
    "in fact , in this nonlocal system , we can think of a mass connected by all other masses , like in coulomb s interactions or in calegaro - sutherland model .",
    "any real fluid has finite sound speed however large it may be . in practice",
    ", the fluid is considered incompressible if @xmath20 . the properties of this fluid",
    "is expected to match with the ideal incompressible fluid .",
    "this is based on an assumption that the properties of fluid with @xmath21 matches with @xmath22 , or @xmath23 .",

    "clearly the computation of @xmath31 and consequently that of @xmath14 requires knowledge of @xmath32 at all positions .",

    "the value of @xmath61 at @xmath62 , or @xmath63 is zero in both 2d and 3d .",

    "this is reminiscent of forward cascade in 3d , and backward cascade in 2d .",
    "hence , we find that the interactions in the incompressible fluid turbulence is nonlocal .",
    "this result appears to contradict kolmogorov s phenomenology which predicts local energy transfer in fourier space .",
    "we will show below that the shell - to - shell energy transfer rates are local even though the interactions are nonlocal .",

    "@xmath74 can be computed using numerical simulations or using analytical tools .",

    "[ fig : t - sim ] .",

    "to summarize , the triad interactions in incompressible fluids is nonlocal both in real and fourier space .",
    "however , the shell - to - shell energy transfer is local in fourier space .",

    "( [ eq : burg : ck ] , [ eq : burg : nu ] , [ eq : burg : pi ] ) are consistent solution of 1d burgers equation .",
    "note however that the renormalization group analysis of burgers equation is somewhat uncertain .",
