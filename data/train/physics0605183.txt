    "as we all have experienced , social networks can evolve in convoluted ways .",
    "friendships can become estrangements and vice versa .",
    "new friendships can be created while existing friends drift apart .",
    "how are these changing relations reflected in the structure of social networks ? as a familiar and illustrative example , suppose that you are friendly with a married couple that gets divorced .",
    "a dilemma arises if you try to remain friendly with both of the former spouses . you may find yourself in the uncomfortable position of listening to each of the former spouses separately disparaging each other",
    ". ultimately you may find it simplest to remain friends with only one of the former spouses and to cut relations with the other ex - spouse . in the language of _ social balance _",
    "@xcite , the initially balanced triad became unbalanced when the couple divorced .",
    "when you subsequently kept your friendship with only one former spouse , social balance is restored .",
    "what happens in a larger social network ?",
    "now we need to look at all triads @xmath0 that link individuals @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we define the link variable @xmath4",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath2 friends and @xmath5 otherwise . then the triad @xmath0 is balanced if @xmath6 , and is imbalanced otherwise ( fig .",
    "[ triads ] ) .",
    "a balanced triad therefore fulfills the adage :    * a friend of my friend as well as an enemy of my enemy is my friend ; * a friend of my enemy as well as an enemy of my friend is my enemy .",
    "a network is balanced if each constituent triad is balanced @xcite .",
    "a seemingly more general definition of a balanced network is to require that each closed cycle is balanced ; that is , @xmath7 .",
    "cartwright and harary showed @xcite that a cycle - based definition of balance is equivalent to a triad - based definition for complete graphs .",
    "this result can be reformulated as follows : if we detect an imbalanced cycle of any length in a complete graph , there must be an imbalanced triad .",
    "balance theory was originally introduced by heider @xcite and important contributions were made by many others @xcite .",
    "cartwright and harary @xcite translated heider s ideas into the framework of graph theory , and proved several fundamental theorems about the structure of balanced networks .",
    "there is also an extensive literature on balance theory ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "cartwright and harary showed that on a complete graph balanced societies are remarkably simple : either all individuals are mutual friends ( `` utopia '' ) , or the network segregates into two mutually antagonistic but internally friendly cliques  a `` bipolar '' state @xcite .",
    "however , spontaneously balanced states are rare  if one were to assign relationships in a social network at random , the probability that this society is balanced would vanish exponentially with system size . thus to understand how a network reaches a balanced state we need to go beyond static descriptions to investigate how an initially imbalanced society becomes balanced via social dynamics .    here",
    "we discuss the evolution of such social networks when we allow the sense of each link to change from friendly to unfriendly or _ vice versa _ to reflect the natural human tendency to reduce imbalanced triads @xcite .",
    "two such dynamics are considered : _ local triad dynamics _",
    "( ltd ) and _ constrained triad dynamics _ ( ctd ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider complete graph networks  everyone knows everyone else .",
    "we will address the basic question : what is the long - time state of such networks ?",
    "in local triad dynamics ( ltd ) , an imbalanced triad is selected at random and the sign of a relationship between two individuals is flipped to restore the triad to balance .",
    "this change is made irregardless if other triads become imbalanced as a result .",
    "thus ltd can be viewed as the social graces of the clueless  such a person makes a relationship change without considering the ramifications on the rest of his social network .",
    "we define a triad @xmath8 to be of type @xmath3 if it contains @xmath3 unfriendly links .",
    "thus @xmath9 and @xmath10 are balanced , while @xmath11 and @xmath12 are imbalanced . with these definitions ,",
    "the ltd rules are ( fig .  [ process ] ) :     ( left ) and @xmath12 ( right ) by local triad dynamics .",
    "solid and dashed lines represent friendly and unfriendly links , respectively . ]    1 .",
    "pick a random imbalanced ( frustrated ) triad .",
    "if the triad is of type @xmath11 , then : ( i ) with probability @xmath13 , change the unfriendly link to a friendly link ; ( ii ) with probability @xmath14 , change a friendly link to an unfriendly link .",
    "3 .   if the triad is of type @xmath12 , then change an unfriendly link to a friendly link .",
    "after the update , the initial imbalanced target triad becomes balanced , but other previously - balanced triads that share a link with this target may become imbalanced",
    ". these triads can subsequently evolve and return to balance , leading to new imbalanced triads .",
    "for example , when a married couple breaks up , friends of the former couple that remain friends with the former wife may then redefine their relationships with those who choose to remain friends with the former husband .",
    "these redefinitions , may lead to additional relationship shifts , _",
    "etc_.      we now study ltd on a finite complete graph of @xmath15 nodes , @xmath16 links , and @xmath17 triads .",
    "let @xmath18 be the number of triads that contain @xmath3 unfriendly links , with @xmath19 the respective triad densities , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) the number of friendly ( unfriendly ) links .",
    "the number of triads and links are related by @xmath22 the numerator counts the number of friendly links in all triads while the denominator appears because each link is counted @xmath23 times .",
    "the density of friendly links is therefore @xmath24 , while the density of unfriendly links is @xmath25 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the quantities @xmath26 as follows : for each friendly link , count the number of triads of type @xmath27 that are attached to this link .",
    "then @xmath26 is the average number of such triads over all friendly links .",
    "this number is @xmath28 the factor @xmath29 accounts for the fact that each of the @xmath18 triads of type @xmath27 is attached to @xmath30 friendly links ; dividing by @xmath20 then gives the average number of such triads .",
    "analogously , we introduce @xmath31 .",
    "since the total number of triads attached to any given link equals @xmath23 , the corresponding triad densities are ( fig .",
    "[ triangles - plus ] )    @xmath32     in total ) that are attached to a positive link ( heavy line ) . also shown",
    "are the stationary - state probabilities for each triad when the friendly link density is @xmath33 .",
    "full and dashed lines represent friendly and unfriendly relations , respectively . ]",
    "we now write rate equations that account for the changes in the triad densities in an update .",
    "we choose a triad at random ; if it is imbalanced ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) we change one of its links as shown in fig .",
    "[ process ] .",
    "let @xmath34 be the probability that a link changes from friendly to unfriendly in an update event , and vice versa for @xmath35 .",
    "a friendly link changes to unfriendly with probability @xmath14 when @xmath36 , while an unfriendly link changes to friendly with probability @xmath13 if @xmath37 and with probability 1 if @xmath38 .",
    "consequently @xmath39 in the special case of @xmath40 , each link of an imbalanced triad is flipped equiprobably .",
    "since each update changes @xmath23 triads , and we define one time step as @xmath41 update events . then the rate equations for the triad densities have the size - independent form @xmath42 where the overdot denotes the time derivative .",
    "let us determine the stationary solution to these equations . setting the left - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ ni - rate ] ) to zero and also imposing @xmath43 to ensure a fixed friendship density , we obtain @xmath44 . forming products such as @xmath45 ,",
    "these relations are equivalent to @xmath46 furthermore , the stationarity condition , @xmath43 , gives @xmath47 .",
    "using these two results , as well as the normalization condition , @xmath48 , in eqs .",
    "( [ stati ] ) , we find , after straightforward algebra , that the stationary density of friendly links is @xmath49    & \\qquad     p\\leq 1/2;\\cr         1                       & \\qquad     p\\geq 1/2.\\cr \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the triad densities of each type become uncorrelated and are given by @xmath50 as shown in fig .",
    "[ n - vs - p ] , the stationary density of friendly links @xmath51 monotonically increases with @xmath13 for @xmath52 until utopia is reached .",
    "near the phase transition , the density of unfriendly links @xmath53 vanishes as @xmath54 .",
    "and the density of friendly links @xmath51 as a function of @xmath13",
    ". simulation results for @xmath51 for @xmath55 ( crosses ) and 256 ( boxes ) are also shown . ]      a remarkable feature of the master equations ( [ ni - rate ] ) is that if the initial triad densities are given by eq .",
    "( [ stat - nj])uncorrelated densities  the densities will remain uncorrelated forever . in this case",
    ", it suffices to study the time evolution of the density of friendly links @xmath56 .",
    "we determine this time evolution directly by noting that @xmath56 increases if @xmath38 or @xmath57 , and decreases if @xmath36 . since the respective probabilities for these processes are @xmath58 , and @xmath14 , we have @xmath59 solving this equation , the time dependence of the density of friendly links has the following behaviors : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are constants .",
    "thus for @xmath64 there is quick approach to a final state .",
    "this state is frustrated for @xmath65 and is utopian for @xmath66 . for @xmath67 utopia",
    "is reached slowly  as a power - law in time .",
    "abstractly , ltd represents a stochastic dynamics in a state space in which each network configuration is represented by a point in this space and a link to another point represents an allowed transition by the dynamics . because balanced networks represent absorbing states of this dynamics , a finite network must ultimately fall into a balanced state for all @xmath13 .",
    "we now estimate the size dependence of the time to reach a balanced state , @xmath68 , for any value of @xmath13 by probabilistic arguments .    .",
    "]    for @xmath65 , we use the following random walk argument ( fig .",
    "[ eff - rw ] ) : when a link is flipped on an imbalanced triad on an almost balanced network ( nearly @xmath69 balanced triads ) , then of the order of @xmath15 triads that contain this link will become imbalanced .",
    "thus starting near balance , ltd is equivalent to a biased random walk in the state space of all network configurations , with the bias is directed away from balance , and with the bias velocity @xmath70 proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , far from the balanced state , local triad dynamics is diffusive because the number of imbalanced triads changes by of the order of @xmath71 equiprobably in a single update .",
    "the corresponding diffusion coefficient @xmath72 is then proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "since the total number of triads in a network of @xmath15 nodes is @xmath74 , we therefore expect that the time @xmath68 to reach balance will scale as @xmath75 @xcite .        for @xmath76",
    ", we define the time to reach the balanced state by the naive criterion @xmath77 ; that is , one unfriendly link remains . from eq .",
    ", @xmath68 will then grow logarithmically with @xmath15 . at @xmath67 , using eq .",
    "( [ rho - cases ] ) , the criterion @xmath78 now gives @xmath79 .",
    "while simulations show that @xmath68 scales algebraically with @xmath15 , the exponent is much smaller than 4 .",
    "the source of this smaller exponent is the fact that the number of unfriendly links fluctuates strongly about its mean value when there are few unfriendly links ( see fig .",
    "[ rate - eqn ] ) . to determine these fluctuations we write",
    "the number of unfriendly links in the canonical form @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is deterministic and @xmath82 is a stochastic variable .",
    "both @xmath83 and @xmath84 are size independent in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a detailed argument @xcite shows that @xmath85 grows as @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",

    "[ avtime ] .",
    "in _ constrained triad dynamics _ ( ctd ) , we first select an imbalanced triad at random and then select a _ random _ link in this triad .",
    "we change the sign of the link _ only if the total number of imbalanced triads decreases_. if the total number of imbalanced triads is conserved in an update , then the update occurs with probability 1/2 .",
    "ctd can be viewed as the dynamics of a socially aware individual who considers her entire social circle before making any relationship change .",
    "because of this global constraint , a network is quickly driven to a balanced state in a time that scales as @xmath97 .",
    "a more interesting feature is the existence of a dynamical phase transition in the structure of the final state as a function of the initial friendly link density @xmath98 ( fig .",
    "[ bavdi ] ) .",
    "we quantify this structural change by the scaled difference in sizes of the two cliques in the final state , @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath100 the cliques in the final state are nearly the same size and @xmath101 .",
    "as @xmath98 increases toward @xmath102 , the size difference continuously increases and a sudden change occurs at @xmath103 , beyond which the final state is utopia . since",
    "@xmath104 and the density of friendly links @xmath51 are related by @xmath105 in a large balanced society , uncorrelated initial relations generically lead to @xmath106 .",
    "thus ctd tends to drive a network into a friendlier final state .     for several network sizes . ]",
    "we now give a simple - minded argument that suggests that a large network undergoes a sudden change from @xmath107 ( two equal size cliques ) to @xmath108 ( utopia ) as a function of the initial friendly link density @xmath98 .",
    "this qualitative approach predicts that this transition occurs at @xmath109 . on the other hand ,",
    "our numerical simulations show that the transition is located near @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "[ bavdi ] ) .",
    "let us assume that a network remains uncorrelated during initial stages of evolution and under this assumption we determine the probabilities for a specific friendly link to flip .",
    "if the network is uncorrelated , the densities @xmath111 of triads that are attached to a friendly link are : @xmath112 for a link to change from friendly to unfriendly , it is necessary that @xmath113 .",
    "that is , this link is a member of more imbalanced triads than balanced triads . from eq .",
    "( [ positive ] ) , this condition is equivalent to @xmath114 , which never holds",
    ". consequently , friendly links never flip .",
    "similarly , the densities @xmath115 of triads attached to an unfriendly link are : @xmath116 to flip this unfriendly bond , we must have @xmath117 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the bond is part of more imbalanced than balanced triads .",
    "this condition gives @xmath118 , which is valid when @xmath119 .",
    "thus for a large uncorrelated network , only unfriendly links flip in ctd , except for @xmath67 .",
    "thus a network with @xmath120 should quickly evolve to utopia , while a network with @xmath121 should quickly approach a state where @xmath122 .",
    "simulations indicate , however , that correlations in relationships occur when @xmath123 and these ultimately lead to a bipolar society .",
    "we find that the precursor to this bipolar society is a state in which the network partitions itself by the dynamics into two subnetworks @xmath124 and @xmath125 of nearly equal sizes @xmath126 and @xmath127 . within each subnetwork ,",
    "the density of friendly links @xmath128 and @xmath129 slightly exceeds @xmath130 , while the density @xmath131 of friendly links between subnetworks is slightly less than @xmath130 .",
    "this small fluctuation is amplified by ctd so that the final state is two nearly equal - size cliques .    to see how such evolution occurs ,",
    "let us assume that relationships within each subnetwork and between subnetworks are homogeneous .",
    "consider first the evolution within each clique .",
    "for an unfriendly link in @xmath124 , the densities of triads attached to this link are given by ( [ negative ] ) , with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath131 when the third vertex in the triad belongs to @xmath125 , and by ( [ negative ] ) , with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath128 when the third vertex belongs to @xmath124 .",
    "the requirement that a link can change from unfriendly to friendly by ctd now becomes @xmath132+c_2[1 - 4\\beta(1-\\beta)]>0,\\ ] ] which is always satisfied .",
    "conversely , friendly links within each subnetwork can never change . as a result ,",
    "negative intraclique links disappear and there is increased cohesiveness within cliques .     and",
    "@xmath133 ( blobs at the extremities ) , with friendly link densities @xmath134 .",

    "for a friendly link between the subnetworks , the triad densities attached to this link are @xmath136 when the third vertex belongs to @xmath137 .",

    "this bias drives the network to a final bipolar state .    finally , note that when @xmath144 , the number of ways , @xmath145 , to partition the original network into the two nascent subnetworks @xmath124 and @xmath125 , is maximal .",
    "consequently , the partition in which @xmath146 has the highest likelihood of providing the initial link density fluctuation that ultimately leads to two nearly equal - size cliques , as observed in our simulations ( fig .  [ bavdi ] ) .",
    "although our argument fails to account for the precise location of the transition , the behavior of @xmath104 in the two limiting cases of @xmath147 and @xmath148 is described correctly .",
    "we presented a simple setting for social dynamics in which both friendly and unfriendly links exist in a network .",
    "these links evolve according to natural rules that reflect a social desire to avoid imbalanced triads . for local triad dynamics",
    ", a finite network falls into a socially - balanced state in a time that depends sensitively on the propensity @xmath13 for forming a friendly link in an update event . for an infinite network ,",
    "a balanced state is never reached when @xmath65 and the system remains stationary .",
    "the density of unfriendly links gradually decreases and the network undergoes a dynamical phase transition to an absorbing , utopia state for @xmath149 .    for constrained triad dynamics ,",
    "an arbitrary network is quickly driven to a balanced state .",
    "this rapid evolution results from the condition that the number of imbalanced triads can not increase . there is also a phase transition from bipolarity to utopia as a function of the initial density of friendly links that arises because of small structural fluctuations that are then amplified by the dynamics .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possible role of balance theory in international relations @xcite , with the evolution of the relations among the protagonists of world war i being a particularly compelling example ( fig .",
    "[ ww1 ] ) .",
    "a history starts with the three emperors league ( 1872 , and revived in 1881 ) that aligned germany , austria - hungary , and russia .",
    "the triple alliance was formed in 1882 that joined germany , austria - hungary , and italy into a bloc that continued until world war i. in 1890 , a bipartite agreement between germany and russia lapsed and this ultimately led to the creation of a french - russian alliance over the period 1891 - 94 . subsequently an entente cordiale between france and great britain was consummated in 1904 , and then a british - russian agreement in 1907 , that then bound france , great britain , and russia into the triple entente . while our account of these byzantine maneuvers is incomplete ( see refs .",

    "[ ww1 ] does not show all relations and thus the extent of network imbalance during the intermediate stages , the basic point is that these relationship changes gradually led to a reorganization of the relations between european nations into a socially balanced state . thus while social balance is a natural outcome , it is not necessarily a good one !",
    "another more immediate , and perhaps more alarming , application of social balance is to current international relations .",
    "as popularized in huntington s book @xcite , there appear to be developing civilizational divisions across which increasing conflict is occurring ( fig .",
