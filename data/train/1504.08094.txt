    "a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) consists of a compact star ( i.e. , a black hole or a neutron star ) and a donor .",
    "the donor usually fills its roche lobe , and thus transfers mass to the compact star via releasing the gravitational potential energy as persistent x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "its spectrum can be described as a combination of a thermal and a non - thermal ( power - law like ) components .",
    "the thermal component is considered as the emission from an optically thick accretion disk , and the power - law component is believed to originate from hot plasmas above or inside the accretion disk @xcite , which is speculated as being the `` corona '' ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in case of having a neutron star ( ns ) as the compact object",
    ", the mass accumulated on the ns surface may end up with a violent thermonuclear explosion , in which the integrated flux could reach up to typically @xmath0 @xmath1@xmath2ergs .",
    "these intense x - ray flares are called type - i x - ray bursts ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "being a short intense shower of soft x - rays , type - i x - ray bursts can be used as a probe of the lmxbs ( low mass x - ray binaries ) accretion via investigating the evolution of the persistent emission along with the runaway of the thermonuclear explosion .",
    "the bursts are expected to have a blackbody spectrum with slight deviations that depend on the burst luminosity ( for details , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to extract the burst spectrum , one usually assumes that the persistent emission is unchanged during the burst and one subtracts it off as part of the background ( see e.g. *",
    "@xcite , however , proposed that the persistent emission intensity is variable ; thus involving a multiplicative factor @xmath3 to the persistent emission for fitting the spectrum during the burst ( assuming an unchanged spectral shape , which we shall refer hereafter as the varying persistent flux model ) .",
    "they found that in photospheric radius expansion bursts ( pre bursts ) the best - fit value of the @xmath3 is significantly greater than 1 , while it seems that the @xmath3 values are @xmath0 1 when the persistent emission is near the eddington limit .",
    "@xcite found spectral excesses from a blackbody spectrum at both low and high energies in sax j1808.43658 , which can be eliminated by using the varying persistent flux model .",
    "the value of @xmath3 seems to be proportional to the intensity of bursts , while this correlation may reverse at higher burst luminosity in the hard state of lmxbs @xcite .",
    "in addition , enhanced persistent emission was also reported during a superburst from 4u 1636536 @xcite .",
    "this shows the significant influence of the burst emission upon the accretion at soft x - rays ( @xmath0 210kev ) , although the underlying mechanism is still not understood .",
    "possible explanations may be poynting - robertson effect @xcite or some other reprocessing of burst photons by the accretion disk and the corona @xcite . in the hard x - rays ( e.g. , above 30kev ) , on the contrary , the persistent emission during the burst",
    "is found to have a clear shortage , indicating cooling of a corona ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence dramatic changes of the persistent spectrum , since the burst emission dominates below 30kev .",
    "this issue was partially addressed in previous work @xcite .",
    "they performed a detailed time - resolved spectral analysis for this rare superburst event and found evidences in the decay phase of an enhancement of the overall persistent flux and a reduction of the corona temperature , which could be consistent with a hard x - ray shortage if the persistent spectrum continues up to tens of kev .",
    "since the superburst event is relatively rare , we explore this issue in more details in this paper by analysing the atoll source ns lmxb gs 1826238 , which shows more frequent x - ray bursts .",
    "gs 1826238 is a persistent atoll source , which does not exhibit significant spectral evolution of its persistent emission until recently @xcite . assuming a distance of 6 kpc",
    ", this source always stays in the so - called low hard state with a luminosity of 5@xmath49@xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "its x - ray emission in a wide energy range of 3200kev can be well described by a pure thermal comptonization model with a characteristic hot electron temperature , @xmath6 @xmath0 20kev @xcite .",
    "gs 1826238 is the famous `` clocked burster '' because of the recurrence of the bursts being relatively stable over the span of years @xcite .",
    "also the burst shapes remain quite constant , and the burst peak fluxes have a rather narrow distribution ( see , e.g. , table 1 ) .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the burst peak fluxes are 24.6 and 2.8 , respectively .",
    "these properties are quite helpful for reducing the possible systematic errors when one stacks bursts together .",
    "the most distinguishing feature for gs 1826238 is that it is one of a few atoll xrbs with a hard x - ray shortage being significantly detected during bursts @xcite .",
    "since for gs 1826238 the thermal emission from either accretion disk or ns surface contributes little at energies above 30 kev , such a hard x - ray shortage provides the most clean probe to the change of the non - thermal emission , which likely helps to restrict the spectral model at soft x - rays with respect to the pre - burst emission . in this paper",
    "we derive the evolution of the persistent emission along the burst at soft x - rays , and then diagnose the burst influence on accretion in a broad energy band , using the knowledge of the previously detected hard x - ray shortage .",
    "we analyzed all _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ _ proportional counter array _ ( pca ) pointing observations and searched for bursts .",
    "the bursts exhibiting data losses were excluded .",
    "we also ruled out several bursts for which the standard 2 mode data were not available .",
    "43 bursts were previously chosen for studying the hard x - ray shortage in the type i bursts of this source @xcite . since in this analysis",
    "the selection criteria are a bit looser , i.e. , bursts with incomplete persistent emission ( 150s before and 250s after the burst peak ) are also considered , 25 more bursts come into the overall sample .",
    "all of the 68 bursts selected for our analysis are shown in table 1 .    in this paper",
    "we analyzed the persistent emission using standard 2 mode data , while the event mode data were used for studying the properties of bursts because of their high time resolution .",
    "the software environment was _ heasoft ver 6.15 _ , including the commands _ `` saextrct '' _ and _ `` seextract '' _ to extract light curves and spectra and _ `` pcabackest '' _ to estimate the background .",
    "the spectral response files were generated by the latest _",
    "pcarsp v11.7.1 _ , in which the drifting pcu gain values over the _ rxte _",
    "mission lifetime have been taken into account .",
    "we have verified that the results are not sensitive to selection of the rxte epoch .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed by using _",
    "xspec 12.8 _ and its python wrapper _",
    "pyxspec_. during spectral fits , the used energy band was 320kev , above which the effective area of _ pcu _ drops off rapidly . to avoid the possible bias in estimation of parameters because of the non - gaussian distribution in some channels with small numbers of counts , a churazov weight was used in the spectral analysis .",
    "we performed time - resolved analysis on each burst , by adopting the same spectral fitting procedure as described in @xcite . in brief , we performed time - resolved analysis for the individual bursts around their peaks . to improve the statistics",
    ", we selected variable time intervals so that the total counts in each time bin exceeds 5000 photons . as a result",
    ", the bin size has to gradually increase toward the burst tail because of the lower count rate .",
    "the varying persistent flux model , i.e. , @xmath7 ) was employed to fit the spectra in the 320kev band , in which the @xmath8 represented the intrinsic burst component , while @xmath9 represented the variable persistent emission ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the `` wabs '' component was used to describe the interstellar absorption ; the hydrogen column density was fixed to 0.3 @xmath10 @xmath11 atoms  @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "our results are independent of the photoelectric absorption model due to the fact that its major influence happen at energies below 3kev .",
    "the varying persistent flux model was chosen because the short burst exposure does not allow measuring all parameters of the relatively weak persistent emission ( see table  1 ) . here",
    "the @xmath13 was estimated by fitting the spectrum before each burst with a phenomenological model , such as @xmath14 or @xmath15 , where the gaussian component was always set at 6.4kev with an arbitrary width of 0.5kev .",
    "more physical models , e.g. , _ comptt _ , would lead to large parameter errors due to _ rxte / pca _ s limited bandpass , but was addressed in the subsequent simulations .",
    "an average reduced-@xmath16 of @xmath0 1.3 ( 45 dof ) shows that it is appropriate to describe phenomenologically the persistent emission with the adopted model .",
    "as mentioned above , we performed time - resolved analysis for individual bursts to obtain the curves of the burst flux and @xmath3 factor .",
    "for individual bursts , however , the possible change of the @xmath3 parameter is not very significant due to relatively large error bars ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) . in order to improve the statistics , we investigated the average evolution of @xmath3 by summing up all the bursts . in practice , we took the peak flux of each burst as a time reference ( t=0s ) and averaged over bins of 3 seconds .",
    "figure  [ multiburst ] shows that at the rising phase of bursts , the @xmath3 value rapidly increases ( o to a ) .",
    "then , along with a further increasing of the average burst flux , the @xmath3 value decreases and reaches a value of around 1 at time of the burst flux peak ( noted as point b in figure  [ multiburst ] ) .",
    "finally , during the averaged burst decay , @xmath3 gradually returns to a value ( point c ) comparable to that at point a , and then smoothly decreases .",
    "we note that if we divide the bursts into two groups along time and then calculate @xmath3 curves individually to check their consistency , the @xmath16 test leads to a reduced-@xmath16 51.83(46 dof ) , which indicates that the slight changes of the shape of bursts over several years @xcite have little influence on our results . for comparison ,",
    "[ multiburst ] also presents the averaged hard x - ray ( 30 - 50 kev ) lightcurve during bursts observed by _ rxte / pca _ using the event mode data @xcite .",
    "lightcurves with smaller error bars ( i.e. , upper panel in figure 1 ) . the soft x - ray and the @xmath3 lightcurves",
    "are changed little if we use identical selection of bursts . ]",
    "the hard x - ray shortage is significant around the burst peak and gradually recovers to its initial level .    to illustrate the @xmath3 evolution against flux , we present these data also in the figure  [ multiburst2 ] .",
    "the correlation is significantly different between the cases when the burst flux is larger and smaller than @xmath17erg  @xmath18 .",
    "the turnover is smooth instead of a sharp peak .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient is 0.87 with a p - value of @xmath19 for the former , but -0.95 with a p - value of @xmath20 for the latter .",
    "this result strongly confirms what was reported previously : @xmath3 is highly dependent on the burst luminosity @xcite .",
    "although a quite similar @xmath3 trend was reported previously in the hard state of 4u 1608522 @xcite , the fact that no significant shortage of the persistent hard x - ray emission is observed in this source @xcite , prevents us from a joint diagnosis of the @xmath3 evolution over a broad energy band .    as shown in @xcite for gs 1826 - 238 ,",
    "the hard x - ray shortages for the persistent emission are still significant around points a and c of the bursts , suggesting a cooled corona .",
    "however , at that time , the @xmath3 curve at soft x - rays show large enhancements of the persistent emission ( @xmath3 @xmath0 1.8 ) . around the burst peak , both the hard x - ray flux and the @xmath3 present a similar trend of anti - correlation with the burst flux , which likely suggests a common cause .",
    "an enhancement in @xmath3 can be the result of , e.g. , the intrinsic spectrum that deviates from a blackbody slightly @xcite or the reflection components @xcite , which might lead to a biased estimate of @xmath3 when the `` bbodyrad '' model is used .    in what follows we diagnose these possible mechanisms in the light of the possible burst influence on the persistent emission , using the results of @xmath3 as derived at soft x - rays in this paper and of the persistent emission shortage",
    "reported previously at hard x - rays @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the `` _ burstatmo _ '' model to describe the intrinsic spectra of bursts instead of the simple _ bbodyrad _ ( see , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the `` burstatmo '' model represents the atmospheres of neutron stars and emergent spectra in a plane - parallel , hydrostatic , and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) approximation .",
    "hence , we performed again the above - described analysis , but now using a slightly different model : @xmath21 ) .",
    "there are three parameters in the _ burstatmo _ model , i.e. , the radius and luminosity of the neutron star , and a normalization .",
    "we can not simultaneously constrain these parameters due to the large error bars and chose to fix the less impacting parameter ",
    "the radius of the neutron star  at 10 km .",
    "if the increasing value of @xmath3 up to @xmath0 1.8 originates from the deviation of the intrinsic burst spectrum from a blackbody , after using `` burstatmo '' model , @xmath3 should be around 1 .",
    "however , we found that the resulting @xmath3 is very similar to the case when _ bbodyrad _ model was used ( i.e. , similar to the figure  [ multiburst ] but with slightly bigger error bars ) .",
    "in addition , the `` burstatmo '' model does not improve the goodness of fit .",
    "the reduced @xmath16 is 1.10 ( 18 dof ) , which is comparable with 1.08/18(dof)using the model @xmath22 ) . in order to further rule out the possibility that the @xmath23 originates from the bias of fitting due to the spectral subtle deviations between the intrinsic spectra ( i.e. , _ burstatmo _ ) and phenomenological _ bbodyrad _ model",
    ", we used the _ burstatmo _ model to produce faked spectra with assumed burst luminosities 0.5 and 1 , respectively , and then fitted them by varying persistent flux model using _ bbodyrad _ model .",
    "the resulting best - fit values of @xmath3 are 1.31 and @xmath24 , respectively , which are inconsistent with the observed values ( i.e. , 1.6 and 1.1 with error bars of @xmath0 0.1 ) shown in figure  [ multiburst ] .",
    "alternatively , the reflection during bursts produced by the accretion disk represents viable possibilities for influencing the persistent flux @xcite .",
    "these were detected during superbursts @xcite or hinted at in normal bursts @xcite .",
    "for individual bursts , the statistics are not good enough to search for possible reflection components .",
    "therefore , we stacked the residuals derived from the spectral analysis using the varying persistent flux model .",
    "if the reflection component does exist , one would expect some structure in the residuals .",
    "the analyses were performed at three instances ( t=0s , 20s , 60s ) with a time bin of @xmath0 1s for the different phases of the ( average ) burst .",
    "we found , however , no additional structures suggestive of emission lines or edges . the excess around 6.4kev is hardly visible with a significance level below 2@xmath25 .",
    "the hard x - ray shortage during bursts in gs 1826238 ( and other lmxbs ) is indicative of cooling of the corona @xcite .",
    "the result reported from a superburst in 4u 1636536 also showed evidence in the burst tail for changes of the electron temperature @xmath6 in the corona when the blackbody normalization was fixed @xcite .",
    "we investigated whether the @xmath3 variability shown in figure  [ multiburst ] corresponds to any corona cooling by performing simulations .",
    "we set free the electron temperature @xmath6 and produced some faked spectra , and fitted them using the varying persistent flux model to look into a possible influence on @xmath3 factor .",
    "we used the model _ comptt _ to describe the persistent flux ; the model parameters ( i.e. , @xmath26=1.02 , @xmath6=21.5kev and @xmath27=3.81 ) were adopted from the report of @xcite .",
    "we note that a slightly different model , e.g. , _ cutoffpl _ or _ comptb _ , barely affects our analysis . assuming the spectrum during the bursts is @xmath28 with variable @xmath6 , we produced faked spectra by using the _ xspec _ command _ fakeit _ , where the _ bbodyrad _ components are set at typical values t=2kev and @xmath29=100",
    ". then we used the varying persistent flux model to fit these faked spectra , i.e. , assuming the spectrum remains constant in shape but varies in normalization .",
    "the resulting value @xmath3 , as illustrated in figure  [ shortagewithte ] , clearly indicates that a lower temperature @xmath6 tends to result in a smaller @xmath3 .",
    "considering that the 3 additional independent variables in the coronal model _",
    ", i.e. , the normalization ( @xmath30 ) , the optical depth ( @xmath27 ) , and the temperature of the seed photons ( @xmath26 ) , are also expected to vary under the shower of soft x - rays from bursts , we further investigated if the @xmath3 evolution can be connected to variations in these parameters . for simplicity , we first kept @xmath27 and @xmath26 unchanged during bursts , but set free the variables @xmath30 and @xmath6 ; see below for a discussion of variations in the other parameters .",
    "we performed simulations by producing faked spectra based on the model @xmath31 , in which there are two free variables : @xmath30 and @xmath6 .",
    "we again used the varying persistent flux model to fit these faked spectra , like done before .",
    "the normalization of _ comptt _ is fixed to @xmath32 , for which the inferred counts rate is consistent with the hard x - ray ( 3050kev ) observations , i.e. , 1.69@xmath33 .",
    "the assumed temperature and normalization in the _ bbodyrad _ model are 2kev and 100 , respectively , which corresponds to the values around the burst peaks ; note that the simulations are insensitive to the assumed blackbody parameters .",
    "the result is illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ contour ] .",
    "the colorbar in that figure shows the value of @xmath3 , whereas the black lines show the contours where @xmath3 equals to 0 , 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "we note that in figure  [ contour ] the @xmath3 is just a result of using varying persistent flux model , and does not reveal physical meanings , i.e. , the enhanced ( suppressed ) accretion rate when the @xmath3 is larger ( smaller ) than 1 .",
    "the result suggests that larger @xmath30 and @xmath6 lead to a larger @xmath3 value .",
    "this is not surprising since both of the @xmath30 and @xmath3 are a normalization ; and @xmath6 will affect the efficiency of the up - compton scattering .",
    "thus , the scenario of corona cooling via bursts can be sketched as follows . at the beginning of the burst ,",
    "the normalization ( x - axis , @xmath30 ) increases rapidly , which phenomenologically accounts for the @xmath3 > 1 ( o>a , point o represents the initial values before the bursts , i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath30=1 ) .",
    "this process may be accompanied by a moderate decrease of the @xmath6 .",
    "then , @xmath6 drops sharply and dominates the burst influence by largely reducing @xmath3 ( a>b and b>c ) . in the cooling tails the process might be a rough inverse of the o>a process , but with a dominance of corona heating over than the cooling .",
    "is just a schematic diagram and the positions of the points ( a / c , b ) are not precise ; they only representing the values of @xmath3 @xmath0 1.8 , and @xmath0 1 , respectively . ]",
    "we note that the burst flux and the @xmath3 value at point a are comparable with these at point c , while its hard x - rays seems to be slightly stronger , which may imply a little larger @xmath6 at point a.    as mentioned above , the hard x - ray shortage in the bursts of gs 1826238 is observed to be rather robust @xcite .",
    "this provides a unique opportunity for testing the cooling scenario speculated above , via checking if the observed hard x - ray shortage is consistent with the persistent spectral model derived from the varying persistent flux model . for a given persistent model and",
    "assumed parameters , one can deduce the hard x - ray count rates by convolving it with _ pca _ s response matrix , and then compare to the results using observations directly .",
    "therefore , the observed hard x - ray shortage can impose a strong constraint in the parameter space of the persistent spectral model .",
    "the hard x - ray count rate at 3050 kev before the bursts is @xmath0 1.69 @xmath35 0.1@xmath33 , and is reduced to a minimum @xmath0 0.8 @xmath35 0.1@xmath33 around the burst peak . assuming the coronal spectrum is @xmath36 , these hard x - ray shortages correspond to the upper and lower cross hatches in the left panel of figure  [ contour ] respectively , between which is the constrained parameter space of @xmath30 and @xmath6 .",
    "we found that for points a and c the parameter spaces having hard x - rays between @xmath0 0.8 @xmath35 0.1@xmath33 and @xmath0 1.69 @xmath35 0.1@xmath33 ( i.e. , between the two hatches ) do not overlap the region in which the @xmath3 is @xmath0 1.8 .",
    "this implies that the _ comptt _ model with variable @xmath30 and @xmath6 can not reconcile the observations at both hard and soft x - rays . to solve such an incompatibility",
    ", one may consider additionally the other two variables in _ comptt _ , i.e. , the temperature of seed photons @xmath26 and the optical depth @xmath27 .",
    "we found that the temperature of seed photons influences little both the hard x - ray shortage and the @xmath3 evolution , probably because @xmath26 ( which is @xmath0 1kev ) is comparable to the burst temperature ( @xmath0 12kev ) .",
    "@xmath27 , however , has a great effect on the persistent spectrum , especially at the hard x - rays .",
    "when @xmath27 decreases from an initial value of 3.81 @xcite to @xmath0 2 , the parameter region inferred from the hard x - rays shortage ( at 3050kev ) is compatible with that estimated from @xmath3 evolution ( at 320kev ) .",
    "this result is shown in the right panel of figure  [ contour ] , and hints at a variable optical depth @xmath27 as a consequence of the burst .",
    "feedback of type - i x - ray bursts onto the accretion material surrounding the compact star in lmxbs has been predicted earlier @xcite .",
    "however , due to the generally short exposure of bursts , it is hard to test them in individual events . using _ rxte",
    "_ observations of gs 1826 - 238 spanning seventeen years , we were able to study in detail the overall changes of the persistent emission while bursting .",
    "this study can be done due to its constant burst shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dominance of the coronal emission in the hard state , and , therefore , significant non - thermal radiation above @xmath0 30kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite , we employed the varying persistent flux model to fit the spectra in the energy band 320 kev during bursts .",
    "the @xmath3 is correlated with the burst flux up to @xmath0 @xmath37 ( which corresponds to @xmath0 @xmath38 assuming a distance of 6 kpc and a gravitational redshift of 1.3 ) , while above this value it is anti - correlated .",
    "this confirms the previous report using the hard state of 4u 1608522 @xcite . in 4u 1608 - 522",
    ", however , no hard x - ray shortages were found @xcite .",
    "we found that , although the varying persistent flux model is successful in fitting the persistent spectrum during bursts , especially in the 320kev energy band , more physical mechanisms are required to account for the contemporary hard x - ray shortage .",
    "we considered a variety of possibilities among which only the inverse compton cooling of the corona seems reasonable .",
    "we found that an increase of the coronal model _",
    "normalization ( @xmath30 ) by a factor of 23 can account for the @xmath3 enhancement with respect to the pre - burst emission .",
    "this increased @xmath30 might result from the increasing seed photons provided by type - i x - ray bursts , or the poynting - robertson drag effect @xcite .",
    "we note that the luminosity of the burst overwhelms that of the pre - burst accretion disk by a factor of more than 10 , while the _ comptt _ normalization only increases by a factor of 23 .",
    "this suggests that the interaction between the accretion disk and the corona is more efficient , which would be the case if the corona `` sandwiches '' the disk @xcite , but not when it is spherical in the inner side of the truncated disk @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with the recent report of @xcite , who found that the spectra of dipping ( i.e. , high - inclination ) lmxbs , regardless of their spectral states , exhibit stronger comptonized emission , suggesting that coronae may have disk - like or oblate shapes .    around the point b in figure  [ multiburst ]",
    ", @xmath3 has a trend similar to that of the strength of the hard x - ray shortage .",
    "this hints at a sufficiently cooled corona when the burst emission is intense .",
    "figure  [ contour ] shows that the electron temperature @xmath6 may account for the @xmath3 valley observed around the burst peak .",
    "such a @xmath6 reduction / recovery feature was observed as well in the decay phase of the superburst from 4u 1636536 @xcite , which also points to corona cooling under a shower of soft x - rays .",
    "we find , however , that to reconcile the hard x - ray shortage with the @xmath3 evolution at soft x - rays , one has to take into account a smaller optical depth @xmath27 .",
    "the comptonised spectrum can be used to estimate the cooling power , i.e. , the power of losing energy of the corona under the shower of burst photons .",
    "here we estimated the cooling power as the difference between the incident flux and the emergent flux after the compton process .",
    "the emergent flux is estimated by using _",
    "_ command _",
    "`` flux '' _ with the parameters specified below , and the incident flux is inferred by analytic estimation , i.e. , the emergent energy of photons is @xmath0 @xmath39 times larger than the incident energy @xcite .",
    "if we assume that around the burst peaks ( point b ) @xmath6 @xmath0 13kev and @xmath40 2 , the inferred cooling power is @xmath41 in the energy band 1100 kev , which is only @xmath0 8% of the cooling power before bursts .",
    "the uncertainties of the cooling power is difficult to be constrained . if we artificially assume the error bars of @xmath6 and @xmath27 are @xmath0 3 kev and 1 at 90% confidence levels , respectively , and they are independent , the 5% lower and upper boundaries of the inferred distribution of the cooling power are 1.5% and 24.0% of the cooling power before bursts , respectively .",
    "this cooling power turns out to be not sufficient to account for the decreased temperature of electrons in the corona @xcite .",
    "thus we speculate that a possible solution might be to take into account an additional mechanism , i.e. , the corona formation , which may be influenced as well by the burst .",
    "this may be reminiscent of the xrb outbursts in their spectral transition from hard state to soft state , where the corona is eventually diminished along with the increasing accretion rate .",
    "if one assumes that the changes of the electron temperature are the result of the balance between the compton cooling and heating mechanism , a suppressed heating process might be a solution to the above contradiction .",
    "however , the heating mechanism currently is still poorly known . in evaporation models ,",
    "both the disk and corona are individually powered by the release of gravitational energy associated with the accretion of matter affected through viscous stresses , which depends strongly on the viscosity parameter ( @xmath42 ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in magnetic reconnection models , the heating power is @xmath0 @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "therefore , if at any point in time the system is in approximate equilibrium , i.e. , the heating power equals to the cooling power , the viscosity parameter @xmath42 or the alfvn speed @xmath44 is expected to change dramatically during bursts .",
    "we caution that this scenario might be oversimplified . in outburst transitions , which is also attributed as the cooling and reheating of the corona , the low state to high state spectral transition at the initial rise of outbursts occurs at a luminosity 5 times greater than that of the transition from high state to low state at the declining stage @xcite , which is known as `` hysteresis effect '' .",
    "this means that the seed photons flux might be not the only factor that can influence the cooling and reheating of the corona , and some other unknown processes should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "we speculate that during transitions from the hard state to the soft state in outbursts of lmxbs , the corona is cooled by the increasing soft seed photons emitted from the accretion disk , which in general leads to an increased value of @xmath27 ( for details , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this seems inconsistent with what we infer for gs 1826238 .",
    "as shown in the left panel of figure  [ contour ] , the main inconsistency that results from @xmath3 and the hard x - ray shortage is at the points a and c. a smaller optical depth of the corona has to be introduced to account for the difference of the persistent emission modifications between the soft and the hard x - rays .",
    "we speculate that this discrepancy might arise from the different optical depths of the corona for the seed photons having different origins . considering that if the corona is geometrically thick above the accretion disk , but exists only within a small radial radius , the optical depth for the seed photons from the accretion disk would be larger for these photons from type - i x bursts .",
    "in addition , the seed photons from type - i bursts would lead to significant poynting - robertson drag @xcite .",
    "this may imply that during bursts the inner part of the corona vanishes and becomes thinner in the radial direction @xcite , leading to a smaller optical depth .",
