    "measurement of the @xmath0 spectrum gives an excellent test for studying the dynamical content of the configurations being used .",
    "nrqcd can be used to give precise results which indicate how the light dynamical quarks feed in to the heavy meson properties .",
    "the program at cleo - c will enable lattice results on @xmath0 spectroscopy to be experimentally verified @xcite .    here",
    "we present new results using dynamical configurations from the milc collaboration @xcite .",
    "we have used the coarser set of available ensembles .",
    "these were generated using the improved staggered asqtad action and have the advantage over previous configurations of the incorporation of 2 + 1 flavors of dynamical quarks .",
    "these are therefore the most realistic simulations of the physical vacuum to date .",
    "several 2 + 1 flavor ensembles are available with one dynamical quark being held at approximately the value of the strange quark mass @xmath1 and two degenerate flavors varying from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . also available",
    "are a quenched ensemble and a two flavor ensemble with degenerate dynamical quark masses of @xmath3 .",
    "we have used both the most chiral 2 + 1 flavor ensemble and the degenerate 3 flavor ensemble plus the quenched and 2 flavor ensembles to best demonstrate the effects of unquenching on the bottomonium spectrum .",
    "we use the standard @xmath4 nrqcd lagrangian @xcite @xmath5 but with corrections to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 fields for @xmath8 errors .",
    "all terms are tadpole improved using an estimate of the landau gauge link .    .",
    "open circles and fancy diamonds represent scales determined from the 1p-1s @xmath0 and 2s-1s @xmath0 splittings respectively . ]",
    "for all ensembles , 210 configurations were used . for all but the degenerate 3 flavor ensemble , 4 different quark ( antiquark ) origins were used on each of 4 different timeslices . for the degenerate 3 flavor ensemble ,",
    "4 different origins were used on each of 2 different timeslices . in fitting the meson correlators , the bayes technique @xcite was used .",
    "@xmath9 matrix fits were done using local , ground and excited state smearings for the s states and @xmath10 matrix fits were done using ground and excited state smearings for p states .",
    "the bayes parameters used were quite relaxed with @xmath11 , each of the amplitudes = 0.1(7 ) , and splittings between excited states @xmath12 .",
    "in figure [ fig : ainv ] results are plotted for the ratio of @xmath13 obtained from both the 1p-1s and 2s-1s splittings in the @xmath0 system to that obtained from using @xmath14 , assuming that @xmath15 .",
    "the results from the dynamical configurations are plotted against the ratio of the pseudoscalar to vector light - light meson mass where the valence quark mass is equal to the @xmath16 sea quark mass .",
    "we will also be able to extract a reliable scale from the quantity @xmath17 once @xmath1 is well determined @xcite .",
    "dependence on the quantity used to obtain @xmath13 with quenching gives ambiguities in calculating other physical observables .",
    "the plot clearly illustrates these ambiguities disappearing as @xmath18 tends to its physical value . for the most chiral 2 + 1 flavor dynamical ensemble",
    "the scales from @xmath0 have converged .",
    "the @xmath0 results imply that @xmath19 .",
    "these scales can be used to determine a value for @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : leprat ] shows the ratio of the leptonic width , i.e. the width of decay to @xmath21 , of the 1st radially excited @xmath0 to that of the ground state @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental points for @xmath22 and @xmath0 are plotted to demonstrate that this ratio is to a large extent independent of the heavy quark mass . at leading order @xmath23 , where the ` wavefunction at the origin ' @xmath24 , the overlap of the local vector current with a given state .",
    "therefore we can calculate this ratio using appropriate amplitudes from our @xmath9 fits .",
    "the @xmath25 factor for this current , which must be calculated in perturbation theory , cancels in the ratio .",
    "it can be seen that although even the most chiral result is still some way from experiment , the ratio is clearly falling with dynamical quark mass .",
    "next , the currents must be improved by adding current correction operators as has been done for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine splitting between the @xmath0 and @xmath27 is a spin dependent quantity which is proportional to the square of the coefficient of the @xmath28 term in the action and also , in leading order in a potential model , to @xmath29 . in figure",
    "[ fig : hyprat ] we show the ratio of hyperfine splitting of the 1st excited to that of the ground @xmath0 state . the uncertainty from the coefficient of the @xmath28 term , and , similarly to the leptonic width",
    ", a lot of the heavy quark mass dependence cancels in the ratio .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath30 are experimentally unseen as yet so the experimental result given is for the @xmath22 system from the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "the plot shows a tendency towards experiment with unquenching .",

    "the diamond represents the current experimental result for the @xmath22 system . ]",
    "the dependence of the scale on the quantity used to obtain it has been a long standing problem of the quenched approximation . full convergence of @xmath13 obtained from different splittings in the @xmath0 spectrum is now clearly seen on the most chiral 2 + 1 flavor milc ensemble . we conclude that this ensemble has good dynamical content",
