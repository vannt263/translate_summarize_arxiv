    ". the presence of bright nearby sources can contaminate the _ nustar _ observations due to the aperture stray light ",
    "unfocused x - rays reaching the _ nustar _ detectors .",
    "the contamination that we see is often called ghost - rays ( gr ) , which are photons that are reflected from only upper or lower x - ray mirror sections ( so - called single scattering photons , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in a close proximity to  ( at the angular distance of 21.5 ) , the bright low - mass x - ray binary system gx9 + 1 is located . therefore , we estimated initially ( at the observation planning stage ) a possible contamination of gr photons from this source to the useful signal . according to",

    "however , a strong x - ray flare was detected in the light curve of .",
    "timing and spectral characteristics of this event are typical for type i x - ray bursts observed from some accreting neutron stars .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this was a burst from gx9 + 1 , and we removed the corresponding part of the data from the following analysis .",

    "we extracted the background spectrum and light curves in the region with a radius of 100(dashed yellow circle ) , located at nearly same distance from gx9 + 1 ( its position is indicated by the solid green circle in fig.[nuimage ] ) .        for timing analysis and pulse phase - resolved spectroscopy , the data were corrected for the barycenter of the solar system with the barycorr command and for the binary system motion using orbital parameters from .",
    "the _ swift_/xrt instrument observed  simultaneously with the _ nustar _ observatory on august 27 , 2015 ( mjd@xmath14 , obsid 00081660001 ) with a total exposure of @xmath15 ks .",
    "swift_/xrt data were used to supplement the _ nustar _ data in the soft energy band and to better determine the level of absorption .",
    "these data were reduced using appropriate software .    the final data analysis ( timing and spectral )",
    "was performed with the ftools 6.7 software package .",
    "the _ nustar _ observatory provides data with very good time and energy resolution , allowing us to investigate temporal properties of  at energies above 10 kev in detail for the first time . in general , the source light curve measured by _",
    "nustar _ demonstrates two types of variability on time scales longer than the pulse period and shorter than the orbital period : smooth changes of the source intensity during the observation and relatively quick variations ( up to @xmath16% ) on the time scale of several thousand seconds .",
    "it can be naturally expected that both types of variations are connected with gradual changes of the stellar wind density over the orbit of the neutron star and its local inhomogeneities .",
    "the pulse period and its uncertainty were determined using the combined light curve from both modules fpma and fpmb in the wide energy band ( 379 kev ) and corrected both for the motion of earth around sun and the neutron star in the binary system . to estimate an uncertainty on the pulse period we generated @xmath17 trial light curves ( using the statistics from the original one ) and determined the pulse period value in each of them using the efsearch procedure from ftools package .",
    "finally , the distribution of periods was constructed with the mean and standard deviation corresponding to the proper pulse period and its @xmath18 uncertainty , respectively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the final value of the pulse period , obtained by such an analysis , is @xmath0 .",
    "this value is larger by about @xmath19 s compared with the previous measurements done by the _ bepposax _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories , resulting in the mean spin - down rate of @xmath20 s s@xmath2 .        to produce the pulse profile we used the combined light curves from both modules in order to get better statistics .",
    "the pulse profiles in five different energy bands 36 , 610 , 1020 , 2040 , and 4079 kev ( from top to bottom ) are shown in fig.[fig : pprof ] .",
    "in all energy bands it has a double peak shape with different relative intensities of the peaks .",
    "the evolution of the pulse profile with energy can be illustrated by the  energy ",
    "pulse phase ",
    "distribution of the intensity constructed with the high energy resolution ( see fig.[fig:2dpprof ] ) .",
    "these pulse profiles were also normalized by the mean flux in each energy band .",
    "details of the technique of the construction of such a 2d - distribution are described by @xcite and have already been successfully used in a number of works . from fig.[fig:2dpprof ] , it is clear that the second peak has its highest relative intensity between @xmath21 and @xmath12 kev . at higher energies the first peak completely dominates the profile .",
    "it is important to note that these two energy ranges are divided by the possible cyclotron absorption line revealed in the source spectrum ( see section  [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "its position is shown with the dashed line in fig.[fig:2dpprof ] .",
    "the pulsed fraction below the cyclotron line energy depends on energy only slightly with a value of 5060% ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ppfr ] ) . at higher energies one can see the gradual increase of the pulsed fraction , typical for the majority of x - ray pulsars @xcite .    to avoid possible biases due to the pulse profile peculiarities or statistics we used two different definitions of the pulsed fraction .",
    "the  standard ",
    "one is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are maximum and minimum fluxes in the pulse profile , respectively .",
    "red circles in fig.[fig : ppfr ] show the pulsed fraction defined by this manner .",
    "another way to characterize the pulse profile intensity variations is to use the relative root mean square ( rms ) , which can be calculated by the following equation :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the background - corrected count rate in a given bin of the pulse profile , @xmath27 is the profile - averaged count rate , and @xmath28 is the total number of phase bins in the profile .",
    "the overall behaviour of the pulsed fraction calculated using different approaches agrees very well with the only difference being a slightly lower absolute value for the rms ( blue squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppfr ] ) . this dependence shows two distinct features : the increase of the pulse fraction with energy and its peculiar change at @xmath29 kev .",
    "note that there is another similar change of the pulsed fraction around 6 - 7 kev probably connected with the fluorescent iron emission line .",
    "the working energy range of the _ nustar _ observatory ( 3 - 79 kev ) , and its unprecedent sensitivity at @xmath30 kev makes the observatory an ideal instrument to search for cyclotron resonant scattering features ( or , in other words , cyclotron absorption lines ) in the spectra of x - ray pulsars ( for more recent examples see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the quality of the _ nustar _ data is so high that the simple theoretical models usually used for the modelling of spectra of x - ray pulsars are often not able to approximate them satisfactorily , and we were met with this problem in the analysis of the  spectrum .    as mentioned above , the spectrum of  is typical for accreting x - ray pulsars . in particular , it demonstrates an exponential cutoff at high energies ( fig.[fig : avspec]a ) .",
    "therefore , as a first step , we attempted to approximate it with several commonly used models : a power law with an exponential cutoff ( cutoffpl in the xspec package ) , the npex model , the broken power law model , thermal inverse comptonization ( comptt in the xspec package ) , a power law with a high energy cutoff ( powerlaw*highcut in the xspec package , @xcite ) . to take into account the absorption in the system , the phabs model was used with the abundances from @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the source and background spectra from both fpma and fpmb modules of _ nustar _ as well as from the _ swift_/xrt telescope were used for simultaneous fitting . to take into account the uncertainty in the instrument calibrations as well as the lack of full simultaneity of observations by _",
    "nustar _ and _ swift _ ( the first one observed  for nearly the whole day , while the latter one observed for only 2 ks ) , cross - calibration constants between them",
    "were included in all spectral models .",
    "none of the models that we used describe the spectrum very well  typically , there are strong deviations at low energies and a depression around 20 kev with a complex shape .",
    "moreover , two models ( the broken power law and powerlaw*highcut ) suffer from the abrupt breaks at the break and cutoff energies , respectively .",
    "this can lead to artificial narrow line features around these energies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in the following analysis , we used the comptt model , which we consider to be the most reliable one .",
    "residuals between the source spectrum and the comptt model are shown in fig.[fig : avspec]b . in comparison with other models ,",
    "the comptt model approximates the soft part of the spectrum quite well and has a clear physical meaning .",
    "at the same time , fig.[fig : avspec]b also shows a peculiarity in the spectrum  a deficit of photons around 20 kev , leading to a high @xmath31 value ( table[tablspec ] ) .    to investigate this feature , we added an absorption component to the model in the form of the gabs model in the xspec package .",
    "it led to a significant improvement of the fit quality and @xmath31 value ( table[tablspec ] ) .",
    "corresponding residuals are shown in fig.[fig : avspec]c , the line centroid energy is @xmath32 kev . it is important to note that some wavelike structure is still present in residuals , that can be connected both with physical reasons and also with imperfectness of the model used .",
    "we interpret this absorption feature as a possible cyclotron absorption line .",
    "two models , gabs and cyclabs in the xspec package , are usually used to approximate absorption lines . while both models are described them adequate",
    ", the cyclotron line energy derived from the gabs model is systematically higher by several kev than the energy derived from the cyclabs model ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for  and the cyclabs model",
    ", the cyclotron line energy will be @xmath33 kev .",
    "besides the cyclotron absorption line , a strong emission feature associated with the fluorescent iron emission line is clearly visible near 6.4 kev . to take it into account , a corresponding component in the gaussian form",
    "was added to the model .",
    "the final best fit parameters as well as the source intensity and luminosity are summarized in table[tablspec ] .    in order to trace the evolution of the source spectrum and its parameters over the pulse period",
    ", we carried out pulse phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "taking into account the relative faintness of the source ( its flux is only about 4 - 5 mcrab ) , the spin period was divided into four wide phase bins , roughly corresponding to the main and secondary peaks ( fig.[fig : parpuls ] ) .",
    "such a division allows us to obtain spectra with good statistical quality at each phase and to determine the spectral parameters .    to approximate pulse phase - resolved spectra",
    ", we used the same model as for the averaged spectrum .",
    "however , the temperature of the seed photons @xmath34 and the cyclotron line width were fixed at the values measured for the averaged spectrum because the temperature and width are poorly constrained due to the limitations of the spectral quality of the spectra .",
    "the column density was also fixed because only _ nustar _ data ( i.e. , @xmath35 kev ) were used for the phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "variations of the spectral parameters over the pulse are shown in fig.[fig : parpuls ] . for better visualization ,",
    "the pulse profile of  in a wide energy band 3 - 79 kev is plotted in each panel by the grey histogram .",
    "the continuum parameters ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) change slightly with the pulse phase , demonstrating a possible anticorrelation between them .",
    "in contrast , the cyclotron line energy demonstrates strong dependence of the pulse phase  in the main peak , it is around @xmath38 kev , while in the secondary peak , it increases to @xmath39 kev . taking into account a relatively small width of the line ( @xmath40 kev ) it can lead to the wave - like structure in the residuals ( see fig.[fig : avspec]c ) .",
    "finally , it is necessary to note that , formally , the best approximation of the  spectrum is given when the powerlaw*highcut model is used for the continuum .",
    "this model was proposed by @xcite to approximate spectra of accreting x - ray pulsars . despite the artificiality and presence of the abrupt break at the cutoff energy",
    ", it describes spectra obtained with the majority of x - ray observatories more or less adequately .",
    "the significant increase of the data quality in hard x - rays with the _ nustar _ observatory raises a question about the physically based models for x - ray pulsar emission as , e.g. , use of the powerlaw*highcut model can lead to artificial narrow absorption lines near the cutoff energy .",
    "nevertheless , the spectrum is an example where this model works and describes it without arising additional artificial features ( see table[tablspec ] ) .",
    "the @xmath31 value for this model is significantly lower than for comptt and is comparable with comptt + gabs .",
    "however , even in this case , there is still some noticable deficit of photons around 20 kev , which can be approximated by the adding of the gabs component to the model ( see fig.[fig : avspec]d , e ) .",
    "the improvement of the fit quality for this case is not so significant as for the comptt model .",
    "therefore , we performed extensive monte - carlo simulations ( @xmath41 trials ) to estimate the significance of the line detection and found that it is about 4@xmath42 for the powerlaw*highcut continuum model .",
    "in this paper , we report results of the _ nustar _ observations of the absorbed supergiant system .",
    "they can be summarized as follows : 1 ) the system demonstrates approximately constant x - ray luminosity on a time scale of more than dozen years ; 2 ) during this time interval , the pulsar spun down with a rate of @xmath20 s s@xmath2 ; 3 ) the possible presence of a cyclotron absorption line at energy @xmath3  kev is found in the source x - ray spectrum .    the observed increase of the rotation period of the neutron star in  can be explained in terms of the wind accretion model in a settling regime @xcite , which can be realized onto slowly rotating magnetized neutron stars at x - ray luminosities below @xmath43  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the observed stable x - ray luminosity suggests that the x - ray pulsar has reached its equilibrium period , which , in this model , depends on the binary orbital period @xmath44 , stellar wind velocity @xmath45 , neutron star magnetic moment @xmath46 and mass accretion rate @xmath47 :    @xmath48\\mu_{30}^{12/11}\\left(\\frac{p_b}{10\\mathrm{d}}\\right ) \\dot m_{16}^{-4/11}v_8 ^ 4\\,,\\ ] ]    where the characteristic parameters are @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 $ ] , @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "a very strong dependence on the wind velocity suggests that it is more reliable to estimate the wind velocity from using this formula :    @xmath52    assuming that the absorption feature at 23  kev is the cyclotron line , the neutron star dipole magnetic moment is @xmath53 and from the x - ray luminosity ( see table 1 ) , we find @xmath54 . therefore ,",
    "using @xmath55  s and @xmath56  d , from eq.[e : peq ] , we can estimate the wind velocity , which very weakly depends on other parameters : @xmath47 and @xmath46 , @xmath57 .",
    "this rather low value is very close to the wind velocity measured in the prototypical persistent hmxb with ob supergiant vela x-1 , suggesting similarity between the two sources .    in the model of settling quasi - spherical accretion ,",
    "the neutron star close to equilibrium can exhibit either spin - up or spin - down , depending on whether the actual @xmath47 is above or below the critical mass accretion rate , @xmath58 ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) in @xcite ) . for the parameters of",
    ", we find @xmath59  g s@xmath2 , i.e. indeed spin - down of the neutron star is possible in this system .",
    "the observed value of the negative torque acting on the neutron star in @xmath60  rad  s@xmath61 , does not exceed the maximum possible negative torque , @xmath62  rad  s@xmath61 , for the parameters of ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the observed steady - state spin - down is consistent with expectations from the settling accretion model .    as discussed in section  [ sec : spec ] , the spectral analysis revealed the possible presence of a cyclotron absorption line in the spectrum of  at energies @xmath63 kev .",
    "additional independent for the existence of this feature comes from the timing properties of the source .",
    "namely , the pulse profile and pulsed fraction dependencies on the energy have prominent features near the same energy .",
    "particularly , the relative intensity of two peaks in the profile changes around 22 - 24 kev ( see fig.[fig:2dpprof ] ) . such behaviour was shown to be typical for another well known x - ray pulsar v0332 + 53 with a well established cyclotron feature @xcite .",
    "the observed non - monotonic dependence of the pulsed fraction on energy ( see fig.[fig : ppfr ] ) is also typical for pulsars with cyclotron lines .",
    "these additional observational facts indirectly support the presence of the cyclotron absorption line in the  spectrum despite of its low significance for the powerlaw*highcut continuum model .",
    "the measured x - ray luminosity in , @xmath64 , suggests that accretion onto the neutron star occurs in the subcritical regime where the radiation plays a secondary role ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this case the accretion flow is decelerated in a collisionless shock formed at some height above the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "the formation of a cyclotron line downstream of the shock occurs in the resonance layer in the inhomogeneous magnetic field , so the line profile can be more complicated than the simple doppler - broadened line @xcite .",
    "for example , depending on the geometry , the line may have a flat bottom or show emission wings .",
    "the complex shape of the residuals shown in fig.[fig : avspec ] , which are obtained assuming a gaussian form of the line , may suggest a complicated line profile or may be an evidence for the presence of the first vacuum cyclotron feature at energies below the fundamental cyclotron line energy .",
