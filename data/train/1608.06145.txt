    "this can also be inferred from the fact that the reduced density matrix of @xmath139 is an entangled mixed state and is identical to the reduced density matrices of @xmath144 and @xmath145 . +    the w state has nonzero , non - maximal entanglement across bipartitions of the form @xmath136 i.e. , @xmath146 and also nonzero non - maximal entanglement of the form @xmath110 i.e. , between pairs of qubits .    it is thus clear that the structure of entanglement in the w state is different from that of the ghz state .",
    "the w states belong to a class of states known as the hypergraph states@xcite . +",
    "this method can be extended to analyse entanglement across bipartitions of multiparty states of arbitrary dimension .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the geometry of the set of density matrices , along with local measurements , can provide deeper insight into quantum phenomena , such as entanglement .",
    "all density matrices that lie in @xmath13 simplexes have rank @xmath8 , those that lie in @xmath147 simplexes have rank @xmath13 and so on .",
    "the entanglement minimising decomposition of a mixed state @xmath0 consists of those pure states that are vertices of the simplex in which @xmath0 lies .",
    "given @xmath0 , a method to determine the vertices of the simplex containing @xmath0 could simplify the computation of the entanglement of formation@xcite .",
    "the extension of the measure @xmath113 to mixed states could prove useful in quantifying entanglement of general multiparty systems .",
    "+ it is known that the three dimensional bloch ball of @xmath148 and the 8-dimensional convex set of @xmath24 density matrices admit the regular 3-simplex and the 8-simplex respectively . by the constructive approach , it can be concluded that the sets of density matrices of order @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 admit @xmath152 and @xmath153 dimensional simplexes .",
    "these simplexes are called sic - povms for short@xcite and their existence is important to establish a geometric separability criterion for density matrices of arbitrary dimension .",
