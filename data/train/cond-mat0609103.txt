    "photoluminescence ( pl ) is a powerful method in the experimental studies of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems in high magnetic fields.@xcite in a typical experiment , an additional electron  hole ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) pair is introduced into the electron system through absorption of a photon .",
    "this causes energy relaxation via coulomb scattering , followed by optical recombination of the well - defined , quantized eigenstates involving an @xmath0@xmath1 pair coupled in different ways to the surrounding electrons .",
    "this coupling is a response of the 2d electron system to the perturbation associated with the photo - injection of a hole ( particle of the opposite charge ) .",
    "depending on the nature of this response and on the number of electrons involved , the pl spectrum either reveals information about dynamics of an illuminated system @xcite or `` merely '' probes the few - body excitonic complexes which form under given conditions ( quantum well geometry , magnetic field , etc . ) but are weakly affected by the surrounding electrons .",
    "the latter scenario occurs at sufficiently high magnetic fields @xmath2 and low electron concentrations @xmath3 , corresponding to small landau level ( ll ) filling factors @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 being the magnetic length ) .",
    "the pl spectra at @xmath6 are usually dominated by recombination of three - body states called trions ( x@xmath7 ) , consisting of an exciton ( @xmath8 ) bound to an additional electron.@xcite the trion binding energy is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the x / x@xmath11 ground state energy .",
    "the lowest ll energy @xmath12 is set to zero for each particle .",
    "the exhaustive reviews of experimental and theoretical work on trions have been written by peeters _",
    "et al._,@xcite bar - joseph,@xcite and also by us.@xcite",
    "let us hence only summarize here that despite involving only three particles , quantum dynamics of a trion in the presence of confinement and magnetic field is neither trivial nor completely understood .",
    "the complications include the competition of several ( cyclotron , coulomb , subband , and zeeman ) energy scales , complex structure of the valence band , spin - orbit effects ( and their effect on relaxation ) , and coupling to free carriers , lattice defects , and phonons .    however , it is established that , depending on the parameters ( composition and width @xmath13 of the quantum well , electron concentration @xmath3 , magnetic field @xmath2 , etc . ) , the trion energy spectrum contains one or more bound states , distinguished by the total spin of the pair of electrons @xmath14 and the relative angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "( i ) at small @xmath2 , the only bound trion is the `` singlet '' x@xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , a 2d analog of the hydrogen ion.@xcite it was first observed in cdte by kheng _",
    "et al._@xcite and then also in gaas and znse@xcite ( with considerably different effective rydbergs @xmath19 and bohr radii @xmath20 ) .",
    "positive singlet trions x@xmath21 ( with the opposite effective - mass ratio ) were also observed@xcite in acceptor - doped samples .",
    "( ii ) in the ( unrealistic ) limit of very high @xmath2 and vanishing @xmath13 , the singlet trion unbinds as predicted from the `` hidden symmetry '' @xcite ( particle  hole symmetry between conduction electrons and valence holes in the lowest ll ) .",
    "however , it is replaced by a different bound state : the `` dark triplet '' x@xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24,@xcite and with an infinite optical lifetime.@xcite despite initial difficulties@xcite it was also eventually detected in pl,@xcite and its vanishing oscillator strength was confirmed directly in optical absorption .",
    "@xcite the singlet  triplet crossover occurs in rather high magnetic fields,@xcite and it is fairly sensitive to the parameters.@xcite ( iii ) additional , less strongly bound trions occur at intermediate fields , including the `` bright triplet '' x@xmath25 with @xmath23 and @xmath18.@xcite all three trions were later confirmed by several independent calculations@xcite and experiments .",
    "@xcite    trions were also identified beyond the `` dilute regime , '' in pl spectra of the fractional quantum hall states .",
    "it was found@xcite that a trion immersed in a laughlin @xmath26 liquid may survive in form of a fractionally charged `` quasiexciton '' state which retains the characteristic internal @xmath0@xmath1 correlations of its trion parent .",
    "this extends the variety of systems in which trions occur and also allows to use their recombination spectrum as an indirect probe of incompressible electron fluids .",
    "@xcite this possibility seems especially attractive for systems in which these fluids may form but can not be studied by transport .",
    "@xcite remarkably , the recombination spectra of the quasiexcitons formed from different trions and interacting with fractionally charged quasiparticles of the laughlin liquid behave differently when the filling factor passes through @xmath26 : they show a discontinuity for the x@xmath22 but no anomaly for the x@xmath16 . therefore , the quantum wells for studying incompressible fluids by pl need be designed so as to yield the x@xmath22 ground state .",
    "this could be greatly helped by accurate theoretical predictions .    in this paper",
    "we address this problem by extensive realistic numerical calculations of the binding energies of ( negative and positive ) trions in doped gaas quantum wells in high magnetic fields .",
    "compared to the earlier studies , asymmetry of the quantum well caused by one - sided doping is fully taken into account by self - consistent calculation of the subband wave functions and by inclusion of up to three subbands along with several landau levels in the hilbert space .",
    "especially for the the singlet trion and for doped wells , the results are significantly different from the previous , less accurate models .",
    "another goal of this paper is to explain and justify the configuration - interaction exact numerical diagonalization in haldane spherical geometry for the realistic calculations of the few - body excitonic complexes .",
    "the method was recently used in several related studies without giving a detailed description,@xcite leaving the questions of its validity and accuracy largely unanswered . the detailed secs .",
    "[ secmodel ] and [ seccaa ] fill this gap , and with the future studies in perspective , point out the advantages over the ( complementary ) variational approch .",
    "in haldane s spherical geometry,@xcite the particles ( electrons or holes ) are confined to the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath27 .",
    "the radial ( i.e. , normal to the surface ) magnetic field @xmath2 is produced by a dirac monopole placed at its center .",
    "the monopole strength @xmath28 is defined in the units of the @xmath29 quantum as the total flux through the surface .",
    "this definition can also be rewritten as @xmath30 which makes clear that @xmath31 measures the surface curvature in the units of magnetic length @xmath5 ( rather than defining a specific @xmath2 ) .",
    "also , due to dirac s condition , @xmath32 must be integral .",
    "the single - particle states @xmath33 form degenerate shells of the eigenstates of angular momentum length @xmath34 and projection @xmath35 .",
    "they are called `` monopole harmonics.''@xcite the @xmath36th shell has @xmath37 and it corresponds to the @xmath36th landau level ( ll ) .",
    "its degeneracy is @xmath38 ( @xmath35 going from @xmath39 to @xmath34 ) , which scales linearly with @xmath2 and @xmath40 .    in the lowest ll ( @xmath41 ) ,",
    "the @xmath42 states describe the closest orbits around the opposite poles , while , in general , @xmath43 .",
    "the wave functions scale with @xmath44 . in the @xmath45 limit , the sequence of orbitals with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , ",
    ", evolve continuously into the series of states with angular momenta @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , ",
    ", obtained in the symmetric gauge on a plane .",
    "therefore , also the spherical orbitals with @xmath52 can be denoted by the value of @xmath53 ( both in the lowest the excited lls ) .",
    "the spherical geometry was originally proposed for numerical studies of extended systems ( such as incompressible quantum liquids ) .",
    "like confinement or periodic boundary conditions , it allows for having a finite number of electrons ( as required for the exact numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian ) in a finite area ( to achieve a finite density of the actual , infinite system ) .",
    "however , haldane s geometry does it without breaking the 2d translational symmetry , essential for various properties of the liquid .",
    "the 2d rotational symmetry of the sphere replaces the symmetry of the plane and leads to the conservation of ( the same number of ) two orbital quantum numbers  two components of the total angular momentum : length @xmath54 and projection @xmath55 .    due to the relation between orbital hilbert eigenspaces in both geometries ,",
    "the `` spherical '' @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspond to the `` planar '' quantum numbers .",
    "the _ neutral _",
    "excitations , which on a plane move along straight lines with well defined wave vectors @xmath56 , on a sphere move along great circles and carry a conserved @xmath57 ( the degeneracy associated with @xmath55 corresponds to that of the orientation of the wave vector , and the quantization of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a finite size effect ) .",
    "the _ charged _ excitations move along the ( quantized ) cyclotron orbits in both geometries , and @xmath54 must be interpreted in terms of the planar angular momentum @xmath58 rather than in terms of @xmath56 ( in this case , finite - size affects the orbit by the surface curvature only ) . clearly , for the spherical geometry to be useful ,",
    "the characteristic length of correlations responsible for the studied effect must scale with @xmath44 , so that it can be made smaller than @xmath27 ( and the finite size effects can be eliminated by the @xmath59 extrapolation ) .",
    "haldane s geometry has also become useful in studying excitons or trions .",
    "the sole advantage is the 2d rotational symmetry of the sphere , preserving the degeneracy of the trion lls in a finite size calculation .",
    "the decoupling of trion s relative dynamics from the cyclotron motion of its `` center of mass '' ( cm ) is a big help in the identification of different trions in the energy spectra , especially of the less strongly bound states .",
    "we put cm in parentheses here , since it is not exactly the cm motion that decouples for charged complexes in a magnetic field .",
    "different trion states are distinguished by their relative ( spin and orbital ) correlations , reflected in difference in the relative angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the cm excitations carry an arbitrary ( negative ) angular momentum @xmath60 and lead to each trion having its own ll accommodating different total angular momenta @xmath61 .",
    "let us stress that the proper definition of @xmath15 and @xmath60 independently conserved in the magnetic field is non - trivial by involving the `` magnetic translation '' generators.@xcite    if , in order to facilitate numerical diagonalization , the single - particle basis is restricted to several lowest single - particle orbitals : @xmath62 , then @xmath60 and @xmath15 are no longer independently conserved .",
    "this causes artificial dependence of computed trion energies on @xmath58 and makes distinction of different trions more difficult . this problem does not occur in spherical geometry , in which the trion lls have a form of angular momentum multiplets with @xmath63 .",
    "resolving @xmath54 ( a conserved number regardless of finite ll degeneracy ) in the diagonalization makes the identification simple : each bound @xmath54-multiplet is a genuine trion state .",
    "exact diagonalization in either geometry may be combined with the size extrapolation to eliminate finite - size ( qualitative and quantitative ) errors .",
    "let us summarize the differences of both approaches . on the plane ,",
    "the coulomb matrix elements are accurate at each value of @xmath64 , but the trion ll degeneracies are only restored in the @xmath65 limit . on the sphere , the 2d symmetry holds at each @xmath32 , but the interaction matrix elements depend on surface curvature . the last effect can be reduced by calculation of matrix elements from haldane pseudopotentials for a plane ( using the spherical expansion and clebsch - gordan coefficients ) , helpful when the @xmath59 extrapolation is impossible .        for diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath66",
    "we choose the configuration interaction ( ci ) basis , e.g. , @xmath67 for the trion . here",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are electron and hole creation operators , and the composite indices @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath56 include all relevant single - particle quantum numbers ( spin @xmath72 , well subband @xmath73 , ll index @xmath36 , and angular momentum @xmath35 ) .",
    "although for only two or three particles the ci basis does not produce as sparse matrices of the ( two - body ) hamiltonian as for many - electron systems , it is still a convenient choice for the evaluation of matrix elements .",
    "the single - particle states used in the exciton and trion basis include both spin projections ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) , up to five lowest lls ( @xmath76 ) and three lowest subbands ( @xmath77 ) for electrons and holes .",
    "different values of @xmath78 were used to eliminate dependence on finite ll degeneracy .",
    "the pair electron spin @xmath14 ( for the trion ) and total angular momentum @xmath54 as well as their projections @xmath79 and @xmath80 are all conserved quantum numbers .",
    "the ci basis is the eigenbasis of @xmath81 and @xmath55 , while the energy ( excluding the zeeman term ) only depends on @xmath14 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , only the subspace corresponding to the minimum values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 , if half - integral ) need be diagonalized , containing all @xmath14 and @xmath54 states and thus covering the entire energy spectrum .",
    "the exact cyclotron energy on the sphere is @xmath85 in calculation , the last term equal to @xmath86 ( here , @xmath87 is the moment of inertia on a sphere , and @xmath88 is the effective mass , not to be confused with angular momentum ) was omitted as a finite - size artifact , and the realistic values of @xmath89 for gaas were taken from experiment . for electrons , @xmath90  mev / t ; for the heavy holes we used the following interpolated formula @xmath91 with the following parameter set : @xmath92  mev , @xmath93  mev / t , @xmath94  mevnm@xmath95 and @xmath96  mevnm@xmath95 , taken after cole _",
    "_ @xcite and expected to work adequately at @xmath97  t in @xmath98  nm wells ( in doped wells , the actual effective width of the hole layer is used for @xmath13 ) .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) describes well only the @xmath99 gap , we used it ( for the lack of better information ) to model scattering to higher lls as well , and tested sensitivity to this approximation .",
    "we also neglected the mixing of heavy and light holes ( off - diagonal terms of the luttinger - kohn hamiltonian ) .",
    "we expect these approximations to affect the negative trion binding energy @xmath100 much less than each of the exciton and trion energies , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , separately . however , a more accurate treatment of the hole ll spectrum might considerably improve the model for the positive trions .",
    "the energies of higher quantum well subbands ( excited states in the @xmath103-direction ) @xmath104 were calculated as a function of well width @xmath13 and electron concentration in the well @xmath3 . in doped wells ( @xmath105 ) ,",
    "the electric field of the remote ionized donors penetrates the quantum well , affecting the positions of occupied energy levels in the well ( for our parameters , it is only @xmath106 ) with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "this in turn affects @xmath3 and the sheet concentration of ionized donors , and thus also the electric field itself .",
    "the schrdinger and poisson equations must be therefore solved self - consistently to give the values of @xmath104.@xcite    as an example , let us look at the values for the @xmath107 subband ( we set @xmath108 ) , which for @xmath98  nm can be fitted by power - law curves @xmath109 . for the electrons we obtain @xmath110 and @xmath111 , weakly dependent on doping , and for the holes , @xmath112 and @xmath113 for a symmetric well and @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116  @xmath117 ( the values appropriate for @xmath118 measured in mev and and for @xmath13 measured in nm ) .",
    "clearly , strong subband mixing can be anticipated at least in higher fields and in wider wells ( e.g. , compare @xmath119 and 6.9  mev to @xmath120 and 7.6  mev for electron and hole , respectively , in a symmetric 20  nm well at @xmath121  t ) .",
    "since the projection of pair electron spin , @xmath81 , is conserved by the coulomb interaction , the zeeman energy @xmath122 does not have to be included in the diagonalization .",
    "instead , the entire energy spectra obtained from the diagonalization without @xmath122 must be at the end rigidly shifted by @xmath123 .",
    "for the trion binding energies it means subtracting one electronic @xmath122 from @xmath100 of the singlet states ( as needed to flip the spin of one of its two unpolarized electrons ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is neglected and it is assumed that that electron and hole @xmath122 s are both constants .",
    "in fact , they depend on @xmath36 and @xmath73 , through rashba and ( in asymmetric structures ) dresselhaus couplings , both mixed by coulomb interaction.@xcite    in the recombination spectrum of excitons or trions , the sum of electron and hole zeeman energies splits the `` @xmath124 '' peaks corresponding to two circular polarizations of light ( both present if both electron and hole spins are populated ) . if @xmath122 were constant , the same splitting would result for the x and all x@xmath11 states .",
    "the observed difference@xcite reveals the inaccuracy of this approximation .",
    "it also reflects different ll and subband mixing in each of these complexes . in our model , the spin - orbit effects can be included as the zeroth order perturbation , given @xmath36- and @xmath73-dependence of @xmath122 ( the ll and subband occupation numbers are easily extracted from the x and x@xmath11 wave functions obtained from the diagonalization ) .

    "the energy @xmath325 is measured relative to the configuration consisting of a ground state exciton unbound from a neutral donor state d@xmath326 .",
    "the plotted energy difference is hence the negative of @xmath327 which is the trion binding energy in the presence of a d@xmath248 , generalized from eq .",

    "the singlet and triplet ground states ( states with the lowest @xmath10 ) are also indicated .",
    "the average trion - donor distance depends on both @xmath191 and @xmath58 . at sufficiently large distances of the donor from the well ( in our example , at @xmath328 ) , the trion is captured without a significant distortion of its wave function .",
    "the lowest state for each trion occurs at @xmath329 ( trion s relative angular momentum ) .",
    "each trion s @xmath100 is slightly decreased , but the dependence on @xmath191 or @xmath58 is weak in this regime .",
    "in contrast , when the donor approaches the well , new trions bind and mix with x@xmath16 , x@xmath22 , and x@xmath25 .",
    "the effect disappears at large @xmath330 , but it is also relatively weak at @xmath331 , because the additional trions have @xmath332.@xcite as pointed out in ref .  , for @xmath318 ( donor at the wall of the quantum well ) , @xmath333  mev of the singlet ground state is only slightly smaller than @xmath334  mev of a free x@xmath16 , but the triplet ground state essentially unbinds .",
    "we used exact numerical diagonalization on a sphere to calculate the energy spectra of negative and positive trions in doped gaas quantum wells in high magnetic fields .",
    "the results obtained with the inclusion of up to three quantum well subbands were compared with a different method , combining exact diagonalization of the in - plane dynamics with a variational calculation for the normal direction .",
    "the obtained dependences of the trion binding energies @xmath100 on the quantum well width @xmath13 , electron concentration @xmath3 , and magnetic field @xmath2 significantly improve over previous theoretical estimates .",
    "in particular , the symmetric - well and lowest - subband approximations are both invalidated for a wide class of realistic systems . presented detailed analysis of the accuracy and convergence establishes the exact diagonalization on a sphere for future quantitative studies of excitonic complexes .",
    "for example , it can be used for the analysis of exciton and trion wave functions ( @xmath0@xmath0 and @xmath0@xmath1 correlations , oscillator strengths , ll / subband projections , etc . ) or more detailed studies of the interaction of excitonic complexes with ionized impurities and/or free carriers .",

    "<S> binding energies of negative and positive trions in doped gaas quantum wells in high magnetic fields are studied by exact numerical diagonalization in spherical geometry . </S>",
    "<S> compared to earlier calculations , finite width of the quantum well and its asymmetry caused by one - sided doping are both fully taken into account by using self - consistent subband wave functions in the integration of coulomb matrix elements , and by inclusion of higher subbands along with several landau levels in the hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis of the accuracy and convergence of the exact diagonalization scheme is presented , including dependence on landau level and subband mixing , sensitivity to the ( not well known ) single - particle spectrum in the valence band , and the estimate of finite - size errors . </S>",
    "<S> the main results are the exciton dispersion and trion binding energy spectrum calculated as a function of the magnetic field , quantum well width , electron concentration , and the presence of an ionized impurity . as a complementary approach </S>",
    "<S> , a combination of the exact diagonalization in the quantum well plane and the variational calculation in the normal direction is used as well . </S>"
