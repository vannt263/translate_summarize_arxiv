    "it is widely believed that the superconductivity in layered high @xmath5 cuprates is largely due to the @xmath6 pairing @xcite .",
    "the evidence for the d - wave pairing comes from variety of different measurements .",
    "a partial list includes the @xmath7sr measurements of the penetration depth @xcite , quantum phase interference @xcite , angular resolved photoemission @xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite , vortex lattice structure observed using neutron scattering @xcite and tunneling spectroscopy @xcite and nuclear spin relaxation rate @xcite . while most of these experiments directly probe the energy gap and the low lying excitations , the vortex lattice observations are different .",
    "they try to relate the structure and interactions of abrikosov vortices to the nature of the order parameter .",
    "this would be extremely difficult if the order parameter would be a pure @xmath0 wave .",
    "the structure of a single vortex and even the vortex lattice on the level of the  macroscopic  ginzburg - landau equations would be the same as for that of the usual @xmath8 wave superconductors .",
    "there are numerous indications , both theoretical @xcite and experimental@xcite , that even though the major pairing mechanism is the @xmath0 wave pairing , there is a small admixture of the @xmath8 wave pairs in the condensate .",
    "ren et al @xcite using a phenomenological microscopic model ( in the weak - coupling limit ) and soininen et al @xcite considering attractive nearest neighbors interaction derived a two field effective ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type theory .",
    "the two complex order parameter fields , @xmath8 and @xmath0 describe the gap function in corresponding channels .",
    "the most general free energy of this kind reads @xcite :    @xmath9   \\label{twofield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the covariant derivative and  @xmath11 is the charge of the cooper pair ( throughout this paper we use the convention @xmath12 ) .  within a particular microscopic model",
    "there might be some relations between these coefficients , but since the ultimate microscopic theory is not known as yet , all of them should be considered as phenomenologically fixed parameters .    using equations following from this free energy or more fundamental equations ( see recent quasiclassical eilenberger equations treatment in @xcite ) ,",
    "one obtains a characteristic four - lobe structure with four zeros for the s - wave inside a single vortex @xcite .",
    "therefore the vortex core looses the full rotational symmetry and only the fourfold @xmath13 symmetry remains .",
    "the distribution of the magnetic field was also obtained recently @xcite .",
    "a somewhat different structure , however , was found in another recent numerical work@xcite ( our analytic calculation confirms that of @xcite and contradicts that of @xcite ) .    outside the core",
    "the s - wave vanishes , while the d - wave becomes rotationally invariant , indistinguishable from the usual abrikosov solution . therefore , to look for differences in the behavior of vortices one would like to be closer to @xmath14 so that the core will be more important ( which is not easy for high @xmath5 superconductors due to their large @xmath15 .",
    "however , since the fourfold vortex core structure comes into a conflict with the high symmetry of the triangular lattice , the asymmetry of vortices can distort the usual triangular vortex lattice at already accessible fields much lower than @xmath16 .",
    "another phenomenon in which the vortex core plays a major role is the dissipation in the course of the flux flow .",
    "these are the two major phenomena in clean superconductors in which one can look for anisotropy effects ( we neglect pinning and other disorder and fluctuations , and concentrate only on ybco single crystals ) .    in this paper we study in detail the above two phenomena , vortex and the vortex lattice structure and the flux flow , using a greatly simplified model : time independent and time dependent one component effective ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "this formulation , essentially without loss of generality , allows us to avoid numerical methods and to extend and clarify various delicate questions about the single vortex and the vortex lattice structure for which there is some controversy or lack of concrete proof .",
    "in particular the location of the phase transition to the square lattice is calculated and depends just on one combination of the parameters .",
    "moreover the quantitative discussion can be extended to study moving flux lattices , which , as is well known @xcite , are much more demanding , as far as the calculational complexity is concerned . their shape and orientation of moving lattices ( or large bundles ) with respect to the crystal lattice and electric field ( or current ) is determined .",
    "then we calculate the current due to the flux flow as function of the external electric field . since the deviations from the full rotational symmetry in the flux flow can be clearly seen only in the nonlinear regime ( the fourfold symmetry forces the full rotational invariance of the ohmic conductivity tensor ) one has to go beyond linear response .. the simplified formulation is indispensable in this case @xcite , but the result turns out to be remarkably simple . in the rest of this section",
    "we outline the basic assumptions , methods and results pointing out where in the paper more details can be found .",
    "within the two field formulation soininen at al @xcite observed that in predominantly d - wave superconductor the s - wave component is generally very small : it is  induced  by variations of the larger d component .",
    "mathematically the dominance of the d - wave follows from the fact that coefficient of the @xmath17 term , @xmath18 , is negative , while that of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is positive in the free energy , eq.([twofield ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is the @xmath0 field which acquires a nonzero value .",
    "then the rotationally noninvariant derivative term @xmath21  communicates  the deviations from the condensate value of @xmath0 to @xmath8 .",
    "note that this is the only term up to ( scaling ) dimension three in the free energy which breaks the full rotational symmetry .",
    "if its coefficient @xmath22 is not very large , the @xmath8 field never becomes comparable to @xmath0 .",
    "soininen et al @xcite observed that even near the core , where @xmath0 is the smallest , it is nevertheless larger then @xmath8 by a factor of 20 at least .",
    "this in particular means that many small terms like @xmath23are irrelevant .",
    "the field @xmath0 is the critical field near @xmath24 , while @xmath8 is not and can be  integrated out  perturbatively .",
    "it will be explained in some detail in section ii , that this generates an effective ( scaling ) dimension five term for @xmath0 , breaking the rotational symmetry , so that our starting point to study the rotation symmetry breaking effects is an effective free energy @xmath25=\\frac{1}{2m_{d}}|\\pi d|^{2}-\\alpha _",

    ".   \\label{fe}\\ ] ] here we have replaced @xmath26 by a more conventional notation @xmath27 and parameter @xmath28 quantifies the deviation from the rotational symmetry .",
    "its relation to other parameters in the two field approach is derived in section ii .",
    "we calculate all the above mentioned rotational symmetry breaking effects to the first order in @xmath29 .",
    "this formulation follows the general philosophy of effective free energy written in terms of critical fields only .",
    "the noncritical fields just renormalize the coefficients .",
    "the rotational symmetry breaking term has dimension five , but breaks the symmetry and is therefore a ",
    "dangerous irrelevant term  using the terminology of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the contributions to it might come not only from the d - s mixing , which always give positive @xmath29 , but also from other sources . even in conventional superconductors",
    "such effects exist @xcite . in ybco",
    ", twinning might be an important contribution to it .",
    "this formulation avoids the problem of the second phase transition at @xmath30 that one encounters assuming @xmath31 in the two field formalism@xmath32    the single vortex solution is obtained in section iii .",
    "it is almost identical to the solutions obtained earlier within the framework of the two order parameters theory , one still can define the  effective s - wave field by @xmath33 and observe the four lobe structure , see fig . 2 and 3 for @xmath0 and @xmath8 components respectively .",
    "relation to earlier work ( discrepancies or common points ) are summarized in the appendix .",
    "the vortex lattice near @xmath16 is studied comprehensively in section iv .",
    "the simplicity of the formulation allows for an analytic study of all the possibilities , not considered before or considered using uncontrollable approximations .",
    "the degrees of freedom we include in the analysis contain : ( 1 ) an arbitrary rotation angle @xmath34 between the crystal lattice and the vortex lattice ( fig .",
    "4 ) ,  and ( 2 ) all the possible lattice , not only the rectangular ones considered before ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . instead of using the variational method to solve the linearized set of equations ,",
    "we solve it exactly even in the moving lattice case .",
    "this is the first time that the lattice is  demonstrated to be rectangular body centered using the most general lattice in the analysis .",
    "we tabulate the lattice characteristics for different @xmath29 in fig .",
    "7 . at certain value of @xmath29",
    "there is a phase transition from rectangular to a more symmetric square lattice first noticed @xcite .",
    "the exience of a phase transion becomes obvious in our formulation in which the effective strength of the four fold symmetry is proportional to the magnetic field , characterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath35 . in low fields , the four fold symmetry is subdominant , so the lattice is closer to the triangle lattice . in high fields , the four fold symmetry dominates ,",
    "so the lattice becomes square .",
    "we find that the transition occurs at @xmath36 the upper critical field line @xmath37 is given in eq.([hc2 t ] ) .",
    "however at the end of this subsection iv.c we caution against too direct interpretation of this result by considering other possible effects which are isotropic and also contribute to the curvature .",
    "the moving lattice solutions are derived in section v from a time dependent generalization of eq.([fe ] ) .",
    "they are not only needed for the nonlinear conductivity calculation which follows , but are also interesting in their own right , since they are , in principle , observable . in the one field formalism there is only one additional parameter to be added to take the dissipation effects into account : the coefficient of the time derivative term of @xmath0 .",
    "unlike in the case of the pure s - wave superconductor , the moving ( with arbitrary , not infinitesimal , velocity ) lattice solution in this case can not be obtained from the static one by a simple galilean boost @xcite .",
    "it is a nontrivial problem and we were able to solve it perturbatively in @xmath29 . unlike the s - wave moving lattices ( which are triangular @xcite )",
    ", orientation is determined by the direction of the crystal lattice as well as by the current direction .",
    "the  dynamical phase transition line as function of current and its orientation with respect to the atomic lattice are quantitatively discussed in subsection v.b and the result is given in eqs.([line],[line1],[line2 ] ) .",
    "magnetization close to @xmath16 ( or the abrikosov @xmath38 is a very simple function of the current @xmath39 and its direction .",
    "the result for the abrikosov @xmath40 is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an angle between the electric field @xmath43 and an axis of the underlying atomic lattice axis .",
    "the number @xmath44 ( typically a bit larger then 1 ) is the usual abrikosov @xmath45 parameter for a given lattice defined in eq.([beta0 ] ) and the constant @xmath46 is given in subsection v.c ( eqs.([beta1],[g ] ) ) .",
    "corrections to the linear conductivity tensor ( which can not break the rotational symmetry ) are briefly discussed and a detailed calculation of the effect of the anisotropy on the nonlinear flux flow are given in section vi .",
    "the result is remarkably simple .",
    "in addition to isotropic linear part there is an anisotropic cubic in @xmath47 term is :    @xmath48    and the hall current is    @xmath49    the two nonlinear contributions to currents are simply related . in these expressions",
    "@xmath50 is the coefficient of the time derivative term in time dependent ginzburg - landau equation eq.([tdgl ] ) .",
    "both direct and hall i - v curves depend on the angle between the current and the crystal lattice orientation via the fourth harmonic only .",
    "the result , contains only cubic dependance of the currents on the electric field , higher orders being cancelled .",
    "finally in section vii we conclude by briefly discussing possible experiments to observe various above mentioned effects , as well as some generalizations .",
    "on very general grounds superconductivity is sometimes considered as a phenomenon of  spontaneous @xmath51 gauge symmetry breaking  @xcite irrespective of the mechanism of pairing or channels in which it occurs .",
    "the @xmath51 electric charge symmetry should be represented by a single order parameter : the superconducting @xmath51 phase .",
    "mechanisms of superconductivity , as far as connection to the gap functions appearing in the microscopic description is concerned , may differ , but this general order parameter representation of the superconducting phase remains the same . while in pure s - wave or d - wave superconductors the @xmath51 phase is simply identified with the phase of the gap function , in more complicated microscopic theories with few channels opened , the superconducting phase is just the common phase of various gap functions .",
    "therefore , quantities other than the phase which enter various phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type equations , although useful , are not directly related to the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "the s - d mixing two component gl free energy eq.([fe ] ) leads to the following set of equations : @xmath52    as we discussed in the introduction , the noncritical @xmath8 component is induced by the @xmath53 mixing gradient term .",
    "therefore the length scale of the variations of the field @xmath8 is the d = wave s coherence length @xmath54 .",
    "consequently the derivative term in eq.([s - equation ] ) @xmath55 is small compared to @xmath56 .",
    "this requirement @xmath57 ( typically @xmath58 ) holds for the vortex solution of @xcite and is , in fact , an excellent approximation in both near and far from the core regions .",
    "then , according to eq.([s - equation ] ) , the field @xmath8 is , to the first order in @xmath59 :    @xmath60    substituting this equation back to eq.([d - equation ] ) , we obtain , to first order in @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath26 was replaced by a more standard notation @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the second term should be treated as a perturbation . in principle",
    "there are terms of higher order in @xmath61 , but one can not take them consistently into account without simultaneously including additional terms in the original two field gl equations . from eq.([gl ] ) the effective free energy eq.([fe ] ) follows . of course the effective free energy @xmath65 eq.([gl",
    "] ) is valid only if possible higher orders of the field @xmath0 and derivatives are neglected .",
    "note that even the linearized set of eq.([d - equation],[s - equation ] ) is highly nontrivial .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite resort to the variational estimate to find a solution . on the other hand , the linearized eq.([gl ]",
    ") can be easily solved perturbatively in @xmath61 .",
    "another advantage of this equation , especially as far as relation to experiments is concerned , is that the number of coefficient is much smaller .",
    "instead of 6 additional parameters in the two field free energy , there is just one additional adjustable parameter compared to the usual s - wave gl equations .",
    "the effective free energy approach can be also motivated by considering the fluctuations of the two fields theory .",
    "assuming that only the @xmath0 field is critical , one can integrate out the @xmath8 field fluctuations perturbatively .",
    "the lower order terms coming out from this analysis are precisely the same as @xmath65 as expected .  in principle , the coefficients of the effective one field free energy should be fixed by a microscopic theory in the same spirit as the way that the coefficients of the two component equations should be fixed .",
    "the general form of the effective free energy can be obtained just by the dimensional analysis and symmetry .",
    "generally , we should allow all the terms invariant under the group @xmath66 with dimensions five or less .",
    "it is a well known property of the @xmath66 symmetry that at the level of the dimension three ( relevant ) terms , full rotational symmetry is restored .",
    "therefore , one has to consider  irrelevant  ( scaling ) dimension five gradient terms in order to break the rotational symmetry down to @xmath66 .",
    "_ apriori _ there are five such terms : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the last two break the reflection symmetry , while out of the remaining three , one can only construct two linear combinations invariant under the rotation of @xmath72",
    ". they are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the second term is fully rotational invariant , and therefore is not important for studying anisotropy effects .",
    "it , however , contributes to effects not directly related to anisotropy such as the shape of the phase transition line .",
    "we will come back to this point in section iv .",
    "similarly , all the other dimension five terms that one should in principle include are rotationally invariant .",
    "they just add a small contribution to the rotationally invariant parts of physical quantities and need not be included when studying the rotational symmetry breaking effects .",
    "the time dependent gl equation in the one field formulation is also quite simple : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the electric potential .",
    "the above equation describes the time evolution of the order parameter and will be used to describe moving vortex systems .",
    "it involves only one additional parameter @xmath50 compared to the 2@xmath772 matrix for the two field formalism .",
    "although , in principle , this parameter describing various dissipation effects can have a complex part @xcite , we will consider only real values .",
    "in this section we find an isolated vortex solution of the one component equation eq.([gl ] ) near @xmath78.the opposite case of magnetic field close to @xmath16 will be considered in next section .",
    "we measure the field in units of the vacuum expectation value @xmath79 and length in units of the coherence length @xmath80 @xmath32 in strongly type ii materials ( when the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath81 is very large ) , as is the case in high @xmath82 superconductors , we can safely ignore the magnetic field and the dimensionless gl  equation becomes : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is our dimensionless small perturbative parameter .. we solve it perturbatively in @xmath85 as follows .",
    "let @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the solution of the standard unperturbed gl equation .",
    "then the first order equation in @xmath85 is @xmath88 the angular dependence of @xmath89 is easily observed to contain only three harmonics : @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is consistent with the fourfold symmetry which is built into the theory .",
    "we therefore decompose @xmath89 into combination of these three harmonics : @xmath93    the equation becomes @xmath94 with @xmath95 defined by :    @xmath96 = e^{i\\phi } j_{1}(r)+e^{-3i\\phi } j_{-3}(r)+e^{5i\\phi } j_{5}(r)\\ ] ] as is well known , the analytic expression for @xmath97 does not exist , however , there are a number of known good approximations . using one of them@xcite , @xmath98 , the set of linear equations are then solved numerically ( the third equation decouples from the first two ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the d - wave configuration is basically indistinguishable from that of the two fields formalism for @xmath99 , see fig .",
    "2 .    note also that within the same approximation and normalization , the @xmath8 component is : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is another dimensionless small parameter .",
    "it s easy to see that @xmath8 has the asymptotic behavior @xmath102    the @xmath8 field is plotted in fig.3 .",
    "the different winding numbers in near and far asymptotic regions give rise to four additional poles in the s component in the intermediate region .",
    "this confirms calculations of @xcite even though some asymptotic analytic expression used there to obtain the numerical results disagree with ours .",
    "the comparison with  @xcite and @xcite  is presented in appendix .",
    "in this section we follow a generalization of the abrikosov s procedure @xcite to investigate the structure of the vortex lattice near @xmath16 .",
    "one first ignores the non - linear terms in the gl equation and finds a set of the lowest energy solutions @xmath103of the linearized equation .",
    "the lattice solution is constructed as a linear superposition @xmath104 in such a way that it is invariant under the corresponding symmetry group of the lattice .",
    "it is well known that the free energy near @xmath16 is monotonic in the abrikosov s",
    "parameter @xmath105 , which is defined by @xmath106 . in the last step needed for some applications , the overall normalization of the order parameter is variationally fixed by minimizing the free energy including non - linear terms .",
    "a general lattice in 2d can be specified by three parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the two lattice constants , while @xmath111 is the angle between the two primitive lattice vectors ( fig 4 ) .",
    "flux quantization constrains them , so that @xmath112 . in the d - wave superconductors",
    "the rotational symmetry is broken , therefore the relative orientation of the vortex lattice to the underlying lattice becomes important .",
    "later we will denote @xmath34 to be the angle between @xmath113 and one of the axes of the underlying lattice . in abrikosov s original paper",
    "@xcite he assumed @xmath114 and obtained the square lattice , later kleiner _",

    "we follow a more generalized formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite which covers all possible lattice types .",
    "in our case we first solve the linearized gl equation pertubatively in the anisotropy parameter @xmath29 .",

    "the fact that the optimal lattice is rectangular body centered is a bit mysterious .",

    "in this section we consider the dissipation in vortex cores due to flux flow . as it is well known , the fourfold symmetry forces the conductivity tensor @xmath344defined by @xmath345 , to be rotationally symmetric .",

    "one also should note that the ginzburg - landau framework adopted here might not be applicable close to the vortex center where microscopic excitation spectrum becomes important .",
    "an approach using elements of the microscopic theory ( via bogoliubov - degennes equations along the lines of @xcite and@xcite ) will be necessary .",
    "[ [ structure - of - static - and - moving - anisotropic - vortex - lattice ] ] structure of static and moving anisotropic vortex lattice    static vortex lattice has been observed using small angle neutron scattering @xcite and tunneling spectroscopy @xcite.although moving vortices have been directly observed using electron tomography @xcite , to our knowledge the shape and orientation of moving large bundles hasnt been observed as yet . moving vortex lattice",
    "is much more sensitive to pinning effects than the static lattice . in the static case",
    "pinning can just slightly distort or cause breakup of the crystal to smaller peaces . for the moving flux lattice pinning",
    "is expected to be much more significant .",
    "the orientation effect that we predict is very small , but the asymmetry in magnetization might be quite significant .",
    "we found the transtion point for the parameter @xmath388 is at @xmath389 .",
    "this transition between the rectangular and the square lattices might be seen in neutron scattering experiments , since the square lattice has higher symmetry ( number of spots is reduced to four at the transition ) .",
    "note that by increasing magnetic field the critical @xmath390 can be exceeded without changing the sample ( @xmath29 is independent of magnetic field ) .",
    "[ [ static - transition - to - the - normal - phase ] ] static transition to the normal phase    as is well known , in the presence of fluctuations , the second order phase transition from superconducting to normal state becomes a weakly first order melting line into the vortex liquid .",
    "this is the reason that the present study of the diagram will be useless for bscco which has a relatively large ginzburg number . for ybco and the low temperature superconductors , the curvature of the phase transition line can in principle",
    "provide an estimate of @xmath29 with reservations mentioned in the end of subsection iv.c .",
    "[ [ dynamic - phase - diagram ] ] dynamic phase diagram    dynamical phase diagram , namely transition from the moving lattice to normal ( or moving liquid ) should be complicated by pinning effects .",
    "however , provided these could be overcome a number of interesting effects could be observed .",
    "first , even neglecting the rotational symmetry breaking effects , there are a number of peculiarities associated with normal - superconducting boundary noted by thompson and hu like the existence of a metastable normal state and the unstable superconductive state . as far as we know , these peculiarities havent been convincingly observed @xcite in low @xmath82 materials .",
    "it would be interesting to reconsider this question for the high @xmath5 materials .",
    "in the s - wave case however , the phase diagram can not depend on orientation of the current .",
    "we calculated this orientation dependance on the angle between the atomic lattice and the direction of current or electric field to first order in @xmath29 , see eq.([line],[line1],[line2 ] ) .",

    "note that the effect can be seen in low temperature anisotropic superconductors , not necessarily in ybco .",
    "the simplicity of the expressions for both direct and hall current eqs.([jdir],[jhall ] ) calls for some special ways to verify it experimentally . the angular dependence of the magnetization near the transition ( given by eqs.([magn],[beta1 ] ) ) might be large enough to be measurable .",
    "there are number of limitations of our approach which can be lifted by possible extensions .",
    "one of them is the assumption of exact fourfold symmetry .",
    "deviations from it in a form of different coefficients of the gradient terms in x and y directions have already been studied recently @xcite using the two field formalism .",
    "if they happen to be small , they can be easily added perturbatively .",
    "these effects of explicit breaking are clearly quite different from those of spontaneous breaking of the fourfold symmetry studied here .",
    "our results for the latices are limited to fields close to @xmath16 only .",
    "it is possible , although more difficult to extend them to lower magnetic fields . another interesting direction is the influence of the anisotropy on vortex fluctuations in the lattice .",
    "we hope to address these issues in the future .",
    "also anisotropy influences fluctuations not considered here .",
    "in addition , the effective one component approach allows to consider possibilities not apparent within the two field one .",
    "for example , the coefficient @xmath391 in principle , can be negative despite the fact that within the two field formalism it should be positive .",
    "twinning is expected to reduce the value of the parameter .",
    "in the two field formulation , the small @xmath392 asymptotics of the solution for the d - wave component of the isolated vortex is given by :          the expression eq.([stwofield ] ) is different from what was obtained in @xcite , eq .",

    "following the same argument leading to an estimate of the maximal amplitude of @xmath398 as in @xcite we obtained @xmath399 apparently this correction accounts for the 20% error cited in @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic form of the wave function was used to make a topological argument about poles in the s - wave . due to the different winding number of small @xmath392 and large @xmath392 asymptotics of @xmath400 , there must exist four poles in the intermediate region .",

    "et al _ @xcite _  _ however performed a similar calculation , but did nt get the poles .",
