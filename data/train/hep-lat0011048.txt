    "a creation operator @xmath3 of @xmath4 vortices was recently introduced for the @xmath2 pure yang - mills theory  @xcite , in order to investigate their relevance for confinement .",
    "we recall that , for a generic @xmath5 theory , @xmath3 creates a defect along the line @xmath6 ; it is defined by the following algebraic relation with the wilson loop @xmath7  @xcite : @xmath8 @xmath9 being the linking number of the curves @xmath6 and @xmath10 . as discussed in  @xcite , two operators satisfying eq .",
    "[ eq : commut ] are dual to each other : in the phase characterised by an area law for @xmath11 , @xmath12 has a perimeter behaviour and viceversa .",
    "@xmath3 can be viewed as a _ dual parallel transport _  along the line @xmath6 .",
    "in what follows we shall choose for @xmath6 a straight line , say along the @xmath13 direction , closing at infinity through periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "@xmath3 on this line can be considered as a _ dual polyakov line_. in ref .",
    "@xcite the behaviour of @xmath14 for this line was studied across the @xmath2 deconfining phase transition , using techniques introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite to study monopole condensation .",
    "the result was that @xmath15 is a good disorder parameter for the deconfinement phase transition , and a finite size scaling analysis allowed a satisfactory determination of the critical temperature and indices .",
    "in addition it was found that @xmath16 coincides within errors with the disorder parameter describing monopole condensation .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a similar analysis for the @xmath0 pure gauge theory , and again we determine the critical temperature and the critical exponents @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as in previous works , instead of @xmath16 , we study @xmath19 which is more convenient from the numerical point of view , and provides the same information as @xmath15 .",
    "again we compare with the analogous quantities defined by magnetic charge condensation , finding a similar behaviour .    the existing literature on the subject  @xcite deals with the @xmath2 case and was already compared to our approach in  @xcite .",
    "the definition of the vortex creation operator @xmath12 presented in  @xcite can be extended to the case of a @xmath1 vortex in a straightforward manner .",
    "the peculiarities of this new definition are summarised in this section , while the reader is referred to  @xcite for a detailed discussion of the method .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath12 in an @xmath5 gauge theory is defined as the ratio of two partition functions : @xmath20 e^{-\\beta \\,\\tilde s[u]}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the usual partition function with the wilson action , @xmath22 = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{x,\\mu\\nu } { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}\\mathrm{re } \\left[1 - p_{\\mu\\nu}(x)\\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath23 is obtained from @xmath24 by multiplying a line of plaquettes in the @xmath25 plane by an element of the center : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .    for the @xmath0 case discussed in this paper @xmath28 corresponding to the case of zero , one vortex and one antivortex .",
    "following  @xcite , it can be shown by suitable changes of variables in the definition of @xmath29 that such a prescription amounts to create a vortex string closed by pbc in the @xmath13 direction at @xmath30 , together with an antivortex line at @xmath31 due to pbc in the @xmath32 direction .",
    "it is worthwhile emphasizing that the vortex creation operator defined here does not depend on a specific gauge choice . at finite temperature ,",
    "it is related to the increase of the free energy when a vortex is produced in the vacuum of the theory  @xcite .",
    "it is gauge - invariant by construction and relies neither on the identification of the vortices locations nor on their density nor on any choice of the gauge .",
    "similarly to the @xmath2 case , the measurement of a single operator @xmath33 is needed at finite temperature , with @xmath34 boundary conditions to ensure that the net effect of @xmath12 is the creation of a single vortex as explained in  @xcite .",
    "the free energy of the vortex configuration is given by : @xmath35    in pure gauge theory , the confined phase is characterised by the area law for the wilson loop , corresponding to a linearly rising potential between static quarks . with a compact time - dimension",
    ", the potential can also be determined from the correlation of two polyakov lines according to : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lattice extension in the compact dimension .",
    "[ eq : polcorr ] and cluster property imply that the vev of a single polyakov line has to vanish in the confined phase , that is whenever the wilson loop has an area law .",
    "one can argue that the dual loops exhibit a similar behaviour : a non - zero value for their vev corresponds to the confined phase , characterised by a perimeter law for the dual loop , while a vanishing vev for the dual polyakov line corresponds to the phase where the dual loop has an area law ( i.e. the deconfined phase ) .",
    "perturbative calculations at high temperature show that indeed @xmath33 has an area law in this phase @xcite , implying vanishing vev for the dual polyakov line . in the following section",
    ", we shall present non - perturbative lattice results for @xmath33 as a function of the temperature .",
    "in this paper , we present data only for straight vortex lines wrapping in the @xmath13 direction by pbc .    due to the exponential in its definition",
    ", @xmath33 has large fluctuations , which make a direct measurement of its expectation value a challenging task . as usual  @xcite",
    ", we focus on the quantity : @xmath38 @xmath39 is easy to compute and yields all the relevant information . at finite temperature",
    ", @xmath39 is expected to have a sharp negative peak in the critical region  @xcite , if @xmath40 is a disorder operator for the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "our results for @xmath39 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitet1 ] , for several lattice sizes . fig .",
    "[ fig : finitet1 ] shows the characteristic peak at the critical coupling , already observed for @xmath2 . as a check of our code ,",
    "we have verified on a @xmath41 lattice , that @xmath39 has the same behaviour for a vortex and an antivortex , as expected due to the invariance under charge conjugation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figcheck ] .",
    "the results for @xmath0 are qualitatively very similar to the ones already presented for @xmath2 in  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath39 in the deconfined phase tends to @xmath42 in the thermodynamic limit , so that @xmath43 vanishes in that limit , in agreement with the result obtained using perturbation theory in @xcite .",
    "the small @xmath44 behaviour of @xmath39 is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : strong ] . since no change in @xmath39 is observed as the volume goes large compared to the physical correlation length",
    ", we conclude that in the confined phase @xmath43 has a a non - vanishing vev in the thermodynamic limit .    finite size scaling techniques yield a quantitative description of the behaviour of @xmath39 in the critical region .",
    "the following equation @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the lattice size , summarises the fact that the rescaled quantity @xmath47 is a universal function of the scaling variable @xmath48 for a detailed discussion of the finite size scaling of @xmath39 we refer to  @xcite . in the @xmath0 case ,",
    "we know that the transition is first order and there are scaling violations which we parametrise in the form  @xcite @xmath49 assuming @xmath50 , one can fit the data to eq .",
    "[ eq : su3scaling ] to extract @xmath51 , @xmath18 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we find @xmath54 in agreement with the result @xmath55 quoted in  @xcite . a value for @xmath18 can also be extracted .",
    "it is however less stable towards variations of the fitting range and also depends on the value of @xmath51 .",
    "a conservative estimate , including a large systematic error , is @xmath56 , which is in agreement with the value 0.54(4 ) obtained in  @xcite from the monopole condensate .",
    "the systematic error is estimated by comparing different fits to the same data , with a subset of the parameters being kept fixed , or from the same fit to a subset of the data .",
    "the variation in the fitted parameters is used to estimate the error .",
    "the data together with the fitted curve are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .    the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitet1 ] display a difference in the shapes for the monopole and the vortex peaks on the left of the phase transition .",
    "however , the behaviour inside the peak is described by the same critical indices .",
    "similarly to @xmath2 , the dual polyakov line is a good disorder parameter for deconfinement also in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "it can be viewed as the dual of the usual polyakov line , the order parameter .",
    "once again , its behaviour is similar to that of the disorder parameter describing condensation of magnetic charges , which in turn is independent of the choice of the abelian projection .",
