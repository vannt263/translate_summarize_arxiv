    "the evolution of languages through the interaction of their speakers is a topic of interest to computational linguists and , like many interacting many - body problems , is difficult to study analytically . in this paper",
    "we follow an approach that views languages at the level of syntax , with syntactic structures encoded as a string of binary syntactic parameters , a point of view originating in the principles and parameters model of generative linguistics , @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite for a more expository account ) .",
    "it is known that syntactic parameters can change in the course of language evolution .",
    "cases of parameter flipping have been identified in the historical development of some indo - european languages , see for example @xcite . for recent results on language evolution from the point of view of syntactic parameters ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we construct a model for language evolution inspired by the physics of _ spin glasses_. these are systems of interacting spin variables , with spins located at the vertices of a graph and with interaction energies along the edges that tend to favor alignment ( ferromagnetic ) or anti - alignment ( anti - ferromagnetic ) of the spin variables at the endpoints of each edge .",
    "the dynamics of the system also depends on thermodynamic temperature parameter , which is a measure of disorder in the system , so that the spin variables tend to be frozen onto the ground state at low temperature , while higher energy states become accessible to the dynamics at higher temperature .",
    "we interpret each syntactic parameter as a spin variable , on a graph representing world languages and their interaction .",
    "we obtain the binary values of the syntactic parameters from the syntactic structures of the world s languages ( sswl ) database , which documents these values for 111 syntactic parameters and over 200 natural languages . to model the interaction strengths between languages , we use data from the mit media lab , by defining the strength of the influence of language a on language b as the likelihood that two languages are to be co - spoken .",
    "in particular , in their database , two languages are connected when users that edit an article in one wikipedia language edition are significantly more likely to also edit an article in another language edition .",
    "the frequency of such occurrences provides an estimate of the strength of the interaction .",
    "the idea of modeling syntactic parameters as spin variables in a statistical mechanical setting is not entirely new to computational linguistics . a model based on this idea",
    "was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the main difference with respect to the approach we follow here is that , in the model of @xcite , the vertices of the graph are individual speakers in a fixed population , rather than languages ( populations of speakers ) as in our model . a statistical physics model of language change based on syntactic parameters",
    "was also constructed in @xcite .",
    "we make a series of simplifying assumptions , to the purpose of obtaining a computationally feasible model",
    ". we will examine the plausibility of these assumptions and their interpretation from a linguistics point of view .",
    "first , we assume that the languages we simulate are sufficiently distinct and never converge and do not concern ourselves with , for example , whether a dialect of language a is truly distinct from language a or whether two closely related languages a and b will at some point just become the  same \" language .",
    "instead , we assume there exists a definition of a language for which the notion of distinct languages is precise and for which the languages we have identified are always distinct .",
    "the second simplification we make is that for a given syntactic parameter , such as the  subject - verb \" syntax , a language either has it or does not have it .",
    "one could account for finer syntactical structures by considering syntaxes of arbitrary length , but this would still admit a binary classification over the languages .",
    "a third assumption is that because language interaction occurs microscopically by human interaction , and a foreign language is easier to acquire if its syntax is familiar , interacting languages will generally prefer to align their syntactic parameters . from these assumptions ,",
    "we construct a hamiltonian and evolve the system from its current syntactic parameter state toward equilibrium .      considering languages as  discrete \" objects ( as opposed to a continuum of dialects )",
    "is a rather common linguistic assumption .",
    "alternative models , such as wave models of transmission of linguistic changes are also possible ( see for example @xcite ) , but we will not consider them in this paper",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether statistical physics methods could be relevant to wave models of languages , but that is outside the purpose of our present investigation .",
    "the second assumption listed above is clearly more problematic : it is a drastic simplification , which ignores phenomena of entailment between syntactic parameters .",
    "indeed , it is well known that there are relations between different syntactic parameters , while our assumption leads us to treat them as independent spin variables .",
    "for example , there are pairs of parameters @xmath1 with the property that if @xmath2 then @xmath3 is undefined , while if @xmath4 , then @xmath3 can take either value @xmath5 : see @xcite , @xcite for some explicit examples of this entailment behavior .",
    "thus , in a more refined version of the model , the second assumption above should be modified in two ways : ( 1 ) an additional possible value @xmath6 of the parameters should be introduced , which accounts for the case where a parameter is undefined ; ( 2 ) relations between parameters should be introduced modeling the entailment property described above .",
    "the first modification simply corresponds , in spin glass models , to considering potts models with number of possible spin states @xmath0 , instead of ising models with @xmath7 ( see @xcite for a survey of the mathematical properties and differences between these models ) , while the second modification requires relations ( at the vertices of the graph ) between different spin variables ( syntactic parameters ) and can be modeled on versions of potts models with external magnetic fields , @xcite .",
    "we will first consider the simpler version of the model , with the second assumption as listed above , and then discuss the effect of introducing modifications as indicated here .",
    "the case with entailment of parameters is discussed in  [ entailsec ] .",
    "a simple modification of the entailment model of  [ entailsec ] also account for variants of the entailment relation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) where @xmath4 implies @xmath3 undefined , and @xmath2 implies @xmath8 , or where the parameter @xmath9 in entailed by more than one parameter .",
    "the latter case requires the coupling at vertices of more than two spin glass models .",
    "we will focus on only one case for simplicity .    regarding the third assumption , since our model of interaction energies for the spin glass system",
    "is based on measures of bilingualism , as obtained by media lab , the evolution of syntactic parameters that we describe would be best understood , linguistically , within the context of the theory of bilingual code - switching , @xcite .",
    "for example , as observed in the study of @xcite of english  spanish bilingual population , the language spoken by this population  acquires \" the pro - drop parameter ( which is @xmath10 in spanish but @xmath11 in english ) in the sense that spanish verbs inserted in english sentences retain their pro - drop form from spanish . in the evolution of syntactic parameters we obtain from the spin glass simulation , we see previously inactive @xmath11 parameters switch to the activated form @xmath10 as an effect of  ferromagnetic \" alignment with the corresponding parameters of nearest neighbor vertices . in a realistic model ,",
    "this should be interpreted ( at least in a first phase of language evolution ) in the sense of code - switching theory , as imported forms from the neighboring languages that are inserted in the original syntactic structure , while retaining their parameters activated .",
    "finally , we should comment on our overall choice of describing languages in terms of syntactic parameters , within the principles and parameters setting of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "while this framework can been criticized , see for example @xcite , it is clear that coding syntactic structures as a string of binary variables makes it extremely suitable for modeling via statistical physics methods , hence it is a very natural setting for our purposes .",
    "we proceed to a more detailed description of the model in the coming section .",
    "the general data of a spin glass model ( potts model ) consist of a finite graph @xmath12 ; a finite set @xmath13 of possible spin states at a vertex , with @xmath14 ; a set @xmath15 of possible states of the system , namely assignments of a spin state in @xmath13 at each vertex in @xmath16 ; a set of interaction energies associated to the edges @xmath17 .",
    "usually the energies are assumed to be equal to zero is the spins at the endpoints @xmath18 are not aligned and equal to a value @xmath19 if they are aligned .",
    "ferromagnetic \" case corresponds to the assumption that all @xmath20 and the ",
    "antiferromagnetic \" case corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "one often expresses the interaction energies in terms of edge variables @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a thermodynamic parameter ( an inverse temperature ) .    in the ising model case , where spin variables have two possible values @xmath5 ,",
    "a typical form of the hamiltonian of a spin glass model is , for states @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an external magnetic field : the first term measures the degree of alignment between nearby spins and the second the alignment of spins with the direction of the overall external field . when we allow for more general potts model cases , where the spin variables have @xmath27 possible values , hamiltonian is rewritten as @xmath28 the partition function of the system is @xmath29 and the associated gibbs probability measure is @xmath30 for more general cases , and a more detailed mathematical discussion see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can fit into this model the case where there are two different interaction energies @xmath31 associated to the two opposite orientations of @xmath32 , by doubling all edges in the graph , so as to consider both orientations , with respective energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this case will be relevant to our application .      with these simplifications and resources ,",
    "the stage is set to map the problem onto a classical statistical mechanics problem .",
    "we identify each language with the vertex of a digraph , and each interaction of the form _ language @xmath35 influences language @xmath36 _ with a directed edge from vertex a to vertex b. such an edge has a weight or interaction strength @xmath37 given by the aforementioned metric used by mit media lab . note that in general , @xmath38 .",
    "we represent the presence or absence of a particular syntactic parameter by associating with each vertex a spin-@xmath39 variable , where a spin of @xmath40 indicates the former and @xmath41 represents the latter . for simplicity , in the following we just use either @xmath10 or @xmath11 for the two possible spin states , as described above , referring to them as `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' , respectively , absorbing a factor of @xmath39 into the term @xmath42 .",
    "the physical analog of this setup is the association of a particle with spin attributes to each vertex and inter - particle interactions with the edges , the usual setting of ising models in statistical physics .    the full specification of the configuration of the system in the single - particle ( single - language ) basis is then given by @xmath43",
    ", @xmath44 is the set of all parameters , and @xmath45 is the set of all languages .    with this picture in mind",
    ", we turn to the evolution . in this tensor product basis",
    ", we can simulate the evolution of each of the 111 syntactic parameters , in the _ independent parameters approximation _",
    ", by endowing the system with an interacting hamiltonian for each syntactic parameter : @xmath46 this hamiltonian is minimized by the alignment of adjacent spins , as @xmath47 .",
    "note that this is not the most general form of spin glass models , where the hamiltonian typically contains additional disorder terms .",
    "we are also not considering here the possible presence of terms playing the role of an external magnetic field b , as in .",
    "we now need to impart dynamics into the model by introducing fluctuations or thermal noise .",
    "continuing in the physical analogy , this system at thermal equilibrium with a  heat bath \" at temperature @xmath48 will have a distribution of configurations specified by the probability density function @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the normalization or partition function @xmath51 and @xmath52 an inverse temperature parameter ( or @xmath53 in physics , with @xmath54 the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "once again , let us translate this to linguistics .",
    "the temperature @xmath48 defines the extent to which languages are `` noisy '' due to external factors ( the heat bath ) ; if they are individually very noisy , then we can expect that these fluctuations will , on average at equilibrium , result in no overall alignment of a syntactic parameter ( magnetization of zero ) . in this limit , the languages fluctuate independently . on the other hand , at @xmath55 ,",
    "all of the noise is frozen out , so the system will be found only in the configuration with the largest probability as per equation  .",
    "that is the ground state , or the state with minimum @xmath56 , in which all languages either possess or lack a given parameter ( magnetization of @xmath57 ) .",
    "we comment more in detail here on the interpretation , in linguistics , of the temperature parameter of the spin glass model . as we mentioned above , we want to interpret that as a heat bath that introduces a certain level of noisiness in the behavior of the parameters . in linguistics , a new probabilistic approach to syntactic parameters was recently developed in @xcite .",
    "it makes a strong case , based on an analysis of treebanks of different sizes for a sample of 20 languages , for viewing the syntactic parameters of a given language not as frozen on the up or down position , @xmath5 , but as a binary probability distribution @xmath58 , which expresses the tendency of the language of have a given syntactic parameter expressed or not .",
    "for example , the case of the head - initial structure is analyzed in @xcite and it is shown that languages typically tend to express elements of both @xmath5 possibilities for this parameters , with a certain probability .",
    "similar results are obtained , in the same paper , for subject - verb , object - verb , and adjective - noun parameters .    in the light of this approach",
    ", we can regard each language @xmath59 , and each parameter @xmath60 , as endowed with the additional data of probability distributions @xmath61 , which represent how  noisy \" the setting of the parameter @xmath60 is in the language @xmath59 .    in general",
    ", one expects that the probability distributions @xmath61 will be different for different languages @xmath59 and different parameter @xmath60 .",
    "however , we can assume that they all depend on an overall thermodynamic parameter @xmath23 that can be tuned to increase or decrease the amount of noise .",
    "in first approximation , one can assume for simplicity that all probabilities are the same , with a form like @xmath62 , so that , at zero temperature ( @xmath63 ) the parameter @xmath60 is set to @xmath10 without any noisiness ( or to @xmath11 in the symmetric case ) , while for @xmath64 ( at @xmath65 ) one has the maximum amount of noise , with the uniform distribution @xmath66 assigning equal probability to the two @xmath5 values of the syntactic parameter .",
    "one can consider more general functions @xmath67 , which are continuous and monotonically interpolating between the values @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "for example , one can slightly modify the case discussed above by taking @xmath70 , where the exponents @xmath71 should be fitted to data like those collected in @xcite , so that there is some common value @xmath72 at which the probability distribution @xmath73 match the statistics for specific syntactic parameters in specific languages .",
    "unfortunately , at present , we do not have a sufficiently large set of data , of the type collected in @xcite , to fully implement this analysis , so we only outlined here the general approach .      in the form of the spin glass model described here above",
    ", we made the overall simplifying assumption of treating all syntactic parameters as mutually independent and uncoupled .",
    "thus , the spin glass model is simply an uncoupled collection of many independent ising models , with the same underlying graph topology and interaction energies , one for each parameter @xmath60 .",
    "this  independent parameters assumption \" is the most problematic .",
    "phenomena of entailment of parameters are well known , see @xcite , @xcite for specific examples . in such cases ,",
    "what typically happen is that one or more parameters depend on the setting of another parameter ( or more ) . as a typical example",
    ", we can take the case of two parameters @xmath74 with the property that , if the parameter @xmath75 is activated ( set to @xmath10 value ) in a language @xmath59 , then the second parameter @xmath9 can take either value @xmath10 or @xmath11 , while if @xmath75 is set to @xmath11 , then the parameter @xmath9 is just undefined in that language .",
    "several such examples , in the family of indo - european languages , are reported in the table of syntactic parameters given in table a , figure 1 , in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the analysis of one such example in  [ entailsec ] .",
    "in addition to the entailment problem , a more general problem , which is less well understood , is whether there are other dependencies between different syntactic parameters , and what would constitute a minimal number of independent binary variables .",
    "this is part of the general critique that is addressed at the principles and parameters model , @xcite . for the purpose of the present paper",
    ", we will ignore this further problem , and we will assume that , except for the entailment phenomena described above , the syntactic parameters can be considered independent and uncoupled .      a statistical physics model of language acquisition and language evolution was developed in @xcite .",
    "their model is also based on the principles and parameters approach .",
    "however , the statistical physics model they construct is significantly different from the one we describe in the present paper .",
    "they are mostly interested in modeling language acquisition .",
    "they model by a gibbs state the probability with which a speaker selects sentences , so that the choice should follow euphonic considerations : how best a given sentence fits the prosodic patterns of the language . to this purpose",
    ", they model prosody as a potential , which defines the hamiltonian of the gibbs state .",
    "the grammar is then estimated by a maximum likelihood argument maximizing the gibbs probability measure .",
    "another linguistic application of statistical physics models , and in particular of the ising spin glass model , occurs in  13.6.213.6.3 of @xcite .",
    "this is a model of language evolution , where the author considers a population of linguistic agents , corresponding to the vertices of the graph , with edges representing the interaction between individual agents .",
    "the model also assumes that there are two distinct languages in the population .",
    "the adoption of one or the other language by a given speaker corresponds to the two possible spin states @xmath5 at that vertex in the spin glass system .",
    "the inverse temperature parameter of the ising model is interpreted as the probability with which speakers of each language produce  cues \" ( in a cue - based learning algorithm ) .",
    "the behavior of the system then models a situation where , above a certain critical temperature , individual agents behave independently and both languages are equally represented in the population , while below a critical temperature one language becomes dominant .    to our knowledge , a model like ours , where the syntactic parameters themselves are treated as spin variables in a spin glass model , and interactions are modeled by bilingualism data , has not been previously considered .     of the parameter , red colored vertices ) .",

    "equilibrium , all of the languages are expected to acquire the subject - verb parameter in the @xmath10 position . ]",
    "equilibrium for the subject - verb parameter , all vertices have local magnetization close to zero , with half of them approaching zero from the positive direction . ]",
    "having established the equilibrium physics expected of a spin glass model of syntax , we seek to explore the evolution of the system computationally . naively exploring the configuration space is computationally too expensive ,",
    "so instead we employed a markov chain monte carlo simulation to propagate stochastically an initial configuration of syntactic parameter values ( as specified by the sswl ) toward equilibrium , through the metropolis algorithm , see for instance @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the algorithm ( see , for instance ,  2 and 3 of @xcite ) is based on the detailed balance condition @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the probability of transitioning from a state @xmath78 to a state @xmath79 , represents the condition that @xmath80 is the stationary distribution of a markov process with transition probabilities @xmath77 .",
    "uniqueness of the stationary distribution follows from an ergodicity property of the markov process , usually implied by conditions of aperiodicity and positive recurrence .    in the metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm , a markov process with the required properties is constructed by obtaining transition probabilities @xmath77 in terms of acceptance - rejection rates : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the conditional probability of proposing a state @xmath79 given the state @xmath78 and @xmath83 is the conditional probability of accepting the proposed state @xmath79 given @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath84 are normalized to add up to one , by requiring that , in the remaining cases the proposed state is @xmath85 .",
    "the usual metropolis ",
    "hastings choice of the acceptance distribution is @xmath86 which satisfies the balance condition @xmath87    the selection probabilities @xmath88 in the metropolis  hastings algorithm are chosen so that the ergodicity condition holds . in the case where the graph is a lattice , this",
    "is usually achieved by considering single - spin - flip dynamics , where in each allowed transition @xmath89 the final state @xmath79 differs from the initial state @xmath78 by the flipping of a single spin . on these possible states ,",
    "the probability is taken to be uniform , @xmath90 , with @xmath91 the number of allowed states .    in the case where @xmath92 is the gibbs measure of a spin glass model ,",
    "a choice of the acceptance probabilities @xmath93 that satisfy the detailed balance condition is given by setting @xmath94 namely , a new state @xmath79 with energy lower than or equal to that of @xmath78 is automatically accepted , while one with a higher energy is accepted with probability @xmath95 . see ",
    "3.1 of @xcite for more details .",
    "( left ) and in the high temperature range @xmath96 ( right ) , as a function of the number of steps in the monte carlo simulation . ]",
    "the ergodicity property is necessary for the working of the metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm .",
    "a markov chain is ergodic if and only if it is irreducible and aperiodic .",
    "irreducibility is the condition that the markov process can reach any possible state of the system starting from any given state in a finite number of steps .",
    "a state is periodic if the chain can return to it only at multiples of some period @xmath97 .",
    "aperiodicity is the absence of periodic states ( @xmath98 for all states ) . under the assumption of single - spin - flip dynamics , ergodicity is satisfied for the ising model on a lattice ( see  3.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the graph we consider here is not a lattice .",
    "however , it makes sense in terms of the linguistic interpretation of the model , to assume a similar type of single - spin - flip dynamics . for similar arguments in favor of single - spin - flip dynamics in models of language acquisition and evolution , see @xcite .",
    "ergodicity of the metropolis  hastings algorithm , with the single - spin - flip dynamics , still holds for our graph .",
    "the following simple argument applies more generally .",
    "irreducibility can be checked using the notion of accessibility .",
    "given states @xmath78 and @xmath79 , let @xmath99 denote the minimum number of steps needed for the markov chain to reach @xmath79 starting at @xmath78 .",
    "the state @xmath79 is accessible from @xmath78 if there is a positive probability that @xmath100 .",
    "suppose that the states @xmath78 and @xmath79 differ at a certain set @xmath101 of sites , with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "for @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , let @xmath109 be the corresponding list of @xmath110 states in @xmath111 , each obtained from the previous one by flipping the spin located at the site @xmath112 .",
    "the probability @xmath113 is then the sum of the products of the probability of obtaining a string @xmath114 in @xmath105 by choosing uniformly randomly a sequence of @xmath110 elements in @xmath16 , times the product of the probabilities of the flipping of the individual spins at the sites @xmath115 for @xmath116 , @xmath117 the precise values of these probabilities depends on the topology of the graph @xmath12 , through the set of edges , that determine the change in energy between successive states , according to .",
    "it is however cleat that @xmath118 , hence all states are accessible from a given one , which is equivalent to the irreducibility condition for the markov chain .    for a single parameter ,",
    "the set @xmath119 of possible states has @xmath120 .",
    "the number of states @xmath121 that are accessible from a given state @xmath122 , in a single - spin - flip dynamics , is the number of states that differ from @xmath122 by flipping a single spin at one of the vertices .",
    "hence , for any given @xmath122 , there are @xmath103 accessible states @xmath121 .",
    "the probability of choosing one of these states is uniform @xmath123 . for a given state @xmath122",
    ", we have @xmath124 if and only if all the accessible states @xmath121 with @xmath125 have lower energy , so that all @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "thus , states @xmath128 with @xmath124 are maxima of the energy .",
    "all other states @xmath122 have @xmath129 , hence they are aperiodic states of the markov chain . if a markov chain is irreducible then all states have same period , hence the remaining states must also be aperiodic . together with irreducibility this implies ergodicity .",
    "thus , if we focus on the behavior of a single syntactic parameter , we simply have a ising model on our graph of languages @xmath12 , with given interaction energies , and we apply the metropolis  hastings algorithm as above .",
    "when we consider more than one parameter at the same time , so that states are of the form @xmath130 , under the simplifying assumption that different syntactic parameters are independent of each other , we just run the same kind of metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm on each parameter , by each time flipping a single spin @xmath122 of a single parameter @xmath60 .",
    "namely , we proceed as described above , using the metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm with single - spin - flip dynamics .",
    "we propagate a state @xmath131 by proposing a configuration @xmath132 and accepting it , @xmath133 , or rejecting it , @xmath134 , with some probability . to simplify the noise ,",
    "we assume it acts by trying to flip the spin at each vertex independently , although in reality this is more likely to occur in clusters . at each step , the algorithm chooses a vertex at random and tries to flip its spin , accepting or rejecting the flip according to : @xmath135    propagating the state for many steps produces a distribution of configurations that asymptotically approaches equation  , allowing one to calculate thermal averages of various functions ( such as magnetization ) by evaluating them on the state at each step and averaging over steps .",
    "we now discuss how one can adapt the previous computational setting to the more refined model that also takes into consideration dependencies and entailment of syntactic parameters .",
    "the first modification in the model consists of the fact that we use , for each parameter , a set of three possible values @xmath136 instead of the binary values @xmath137 , thus allowing for the possibility that a parameter may be undefined ( by effect of the values of other parameters ) .",
    "thus , instead of the ising model , we are looking at a potts model with @xmath0 .",
    "the natural generalization of the metropolis dynamics of the ising model is the wider class of glauber dynamics on graphs , where the single - spin - flip dynamics is replaced by the assumption that each move changes the parameter value at just one vertex , by choosing a possible value uniformly at random .",
    "consider again the situation described in ",
    "[ entsec1 ] , where we have two parameters @xmath74 with the property that , if the parameter @xmath138 then the parameter @xmath9 can take values @xmath5 , while if the parameter @xmath139 then @xmath9 is undefined . as before , we associate spin variables @xmath140 and @xmath141 to the two parameters , but now we assume that @xmath140 has two possible spin states @xmath137 , as before , while @xmath141 has three possible spin states , @xmath142 , with @xmath6 for the case when the parameter is undefined .    thus , we see that , in order to accommodate the entailment relations , we need to construct a multivariable spin glass model , where some of the spin variables associated to the vertices behave like an ising model ( with number of spin states @xmath7 ) , while other variables behave like a potts model ( with number of spin states @xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , the entailment relation should be modeled by additional interaction terms in the hamiltonian , that couple the variables @xmath140 and @xmath141 , in such a way that the configurations with @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and with @xmath145 and @xmath146 are favored energetically over all the other possible combinations .",
    "this leads us into a new class of spin glass model , which to our knowledge has not been considered in physics so far , where different spin variables , with different numbers of spin states coexist on the same graph and are coupled with one another .",
    "we describe a possible choice of an interaction term that achieves the desired result .",
    "we focus on a case with only two parameters @xmath147 with an entailment relation as above .",
    "let @xmath148 be the spin variables , as before , where @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we consider a change of variable for the first spin , with the new variable @xmath151 defined by @xmath152 .",
    "this just corresponds to the two possible choices of representing the group @xmath153 in the additive form @xmath154 or in the multiplicative form @xmath155 .",
    "we also associate to the spin variables @xmath156 a variable @xmath157 .",
    "we then consider a hamiltonian given by the sum of two terms @xmath158 , where the term @xmath159 expresses the edge interactions between different languages , as in , written in the potts model form @xmath160 where we treat the two parameters as independent , while the interaction between the parameters due to the entailment relation is encoded in the @xmath161 term as @xmath162 for @xmath163 , this gives an anti - ferromagnetic pairing between the variables @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "the preferred energy states for the hamiltonian @xmath161 are those where either @xmath166 and @xmath167 , or @xmath168 and @xmath169 , which correspond , respectively , to the entailment relations @xmath170 and @xmath171 , or @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "notice that the size of the parameters @xmath174 in the term @xmath161 in the hamiltonian determine how strongly enforced the entailment relation is in a given language : for @xmath175 , an infinite energy barrier separates the ground states @xmath176 from the excited states @xmath177 , hence the entailment is strongly enforced , while lower values of @xmath174 would imply that the language @xmath59 admits a certain frequency of exceptions to this syntactic rule .",
    "these should be interpreted in the same sense as the probabilistic approach to setting syntactic parameters discussed in @xcite , see also the discussion in  [ tempsec ] above .",
    "notice that , if we freeze one of the parameter @xmath75 and only consider the evolution of the second parameter , then the hamiltonian above can be regarded simply as a case of potts model with external magnetic field .",
    "we then run the analog of the metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm for the hamiltonian @xmath178 on the graph of languages and language interactions .",
    "since we now have spin variables with more than two possible states , instead of the single - spin - flip dynamics one uses the appropriate glauber dynamics . for general results about ergodicity and convergence time of glauber dynamics on some classes of graphs ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite . in the simple case we analyze in  [ entailsec ] below",
    ", we will work with a complete graph , so the results of @xcite apply .",
    "part of the implementation consisted of parsing and converting the sswl database of syntactic parameters in a form usable for data analysis .",
    "additionally , discrepancies in nomenclature between the mit media lab topology source and the sswl database had to be identified and manually resolved .",
    "the implementation for the independent parameters simulation was executed in matlab .",
    "the implementation for the entailment of parameters was executed in java .",
    "the source files of the code are available at the github repository : ` https://github.com/pointofnoreturn/spin_glass_model `",
    "as a first simulation , we consider all parameters as independent spin variables , hence we can focus on just one parameter at a time and run a single - parameter simulation .",
    "we report here the case of the subject - verb parameter as an illustrative example : we describe the behavior at low and high temperature @xmath48 , averaging over a million steps .",
    "this is enough to obtain a clear understanding of the phase diagrams of simulations for all of the other parameters , when considered independently .",
    "the code in the github repository can be used to generate analogous simulations for all parameters .    here",
    ", when we refer to the `` low '' and `` high '' temperature regimes , we mean the range in which the ratio @xmath179 is very small or , respectively , very large .",
    "the initial state specified by the sswl is given in figure [ init ] , where the vertices are represented as circular nodes colored red if the language possesses the parameter or blue if it lacks the parameter .",
    "the sizes of the vertices do not signify anything in these graphs : variable sizes are only used for ease of visualization .",
    "figure [ init ] suggests that the vast majority of languages currently possess this parameter in the activated form @xmath10 .",
    "evolving this system at very low temperature ( @xmath180 ) , we want to know the local magnetization , or the thermal average of the spin value at each vertex .",
    "since we are in the low temperature regime , we expect that the vertices will tend to orient their spins in the same direction ( either all of the languages will tend to possess the parameter or will lack it ) . marking vertices with @xmath181 red and vertices with @xmath182 blue , we can look at a graph of these languages at equilibrium , given in figure [ smallt ] .    as expected , since the system is close to @xmath55 , it is also close to the ground state .",
    "in fact , a configuration randomly sampled from the equilibrium ensemble will also look like figure [ smallt ] nearly 100% of the time , because of how dominant the all - up configuration is : it is nearly impossible at low @xmath48 for the state to propagate to a configuration that is not the ground state . at @xmath55 ,",
    "this is the only configuration in the ensemble . at this low temperature ,",
    "the languages quickly converge during their evolution to a state in which they all acquire the parameter in the activated form @xmath10 . a more physical way to view this is to look at a plot of the average spin as a function of time , as given in the first graph of figure [ avgspinfig ] .",
    "one may wonder why this system always ends up in this `` all - up '' state instead of an `` all - down '' state .",
    "the key is that the initial configuration is dominated by spin - up vertices , so the energy barrier is much higher for a droplet of spin - down to expand and dominate the system than it is for the sea of spin - up to swallow the droplets .",
    "what happens when @xmath48 is very large ?",
    "taking @xmath96 , the local magnetizations approach zero , with exactly half of the vertices approaching zero from the positive direction as in figure [ larget ] .",
    "in fact , the local magnetizations vary with mean @xmath183 and median @xmath184 on the interval @xmath185 $ ] .    in this case",
    ", a configuration picked at random from the equilibrium ensemble is most likely to have approximately half of the vertices with spin up .",
    "because @xmath48 is large , a state can propagate to almost any other configuration fairly easily . at equilibrium ,",
    "the languages here evolve approximately independently of each other , so the average ( over vertices ) spin fluctuates about zero , as in the second graph of figure [ avgspinfig ] .",
    "there are then two points to note : the model behaves as predicted , and it is marked by the same symmetry - breaking phase transition observed in the 2d ising ferromagnet at a critical temperature .",
    "this is not surprising , since this model is at its core just a ferromagnet with a more complicated topology .",
    "we consider here a simple case where we focus on two parameters with an entailment relation , over a small set of indo - european languages . in this case , we take the data on the values of the syntactic parameters from @xcite , @xcite , while we still use the same data from the mit media lab database for the interaction strengths between different languages . in this simulation",
    "we used the media lab data based on book translations instead of wikipedia editing .",

    "the first parameter @xmath75 expresses partial definiteness , while the parameter @xmath9 is definiteness checking .",
    "see for instance @xcite for a discussion of the role of these parameters .",
    "we consider three languages : english , russian , and bulgarian .",
    "we input interaction energies taken from the same mit media lab data graph , and we neglect the effect of interaction with other languages .",
    "the initial configuration of the two parameters , taken from table a of @xcite is according to the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these examples are only illustrative and not entirely realistic , because we have singled out a small portion of the language graph that exhibits an interesting configuration of entailed parameters in the initial state , and we have run the simulation neglecting the interactions with all the other languages in the rest of the larger language graphs , which will also affect the behavior of the system . these examples , however , are interesting because they show situations where a configuration of entailed parameters reaches an equilibrium states where parameters of the individual languages have undergone some changes , but have not always converged to a configuration where all the parameters are aligned . while in the first example one obtains complete alignment of all the parameters in the low temperature and low energy regime , in the second example , even in this range , parameters do not fully align .",
    "this shows that the presence of entailment between syntactic parameters can have a substantial effect on the dynamics that differs significantly in outcome from the case where one assumes an independence hypothesis on parameters .",
    "in this paper , we introduced a new tool to study the flow of syntactic parameters by mapping the problem onto a spin glass model .",
    "this tool provides some flexibility , as one could provide any topology and any adjacency matrix .",
    "we have shown that , under a hypothesis of independence between syntactic parameters , in the evolution of the system parameters tend to align to the @xmath10 position .",
    "we related this to linguistic models of bilingual code - switching .",
    "we also showed that , when entailment relations between parameters are taken into account , the uncoupled ising models are replaced by a coupling at the vertices of ising and potts models with same edge interactions .",
    "one obtains then more complicated equilibrium configurations , depending on the entailment energy parameter , which gives the strength of the coupling , and its relation to the  temperature \" parameter . even in the low energy and low temperature regime",
    "one finds cases that do not yield a complete alignment of parameters .    one factor not accounted for in this project was the number of speakers for each language , which could significantly change the interaction strengths .",
    "another interesting scenario would involve disordering terms in which two interacting languages actually prefer to antialign their parameters .",
    "an overall hypothesis of this model is that the interaction energies along the edges , which are modeled on estimates of the size of the bilingual population , remain constant during the evolution . in a realistic model",
    ", the strength of the interaction would also be co - evolving .",
    "it is also likely that factors such as the existence of better and more efficient automated translators will eventually cause drastic changes in the size of human bilingual or multilingual populations , so the feasibility of such models of linguistic evolution may also be altered by external factors of this sort .",
