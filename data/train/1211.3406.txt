    "in contrast , much less attention has been devoted to spin - polarized systems away from the kondo regime and with two impurities .",

    "the short - range limit presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) reveals that the ldos given by eq .",

    "each one corresponds to the discrete levels of the adatom ( @xmath112 ) and the subsurface impurity ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the main feature in this situation is that the fano profile conserves its line shape when the dimensionless parameter @xmath133 is changed .",
    "additionally , this profile is suppressed for increasing distances , tending to the dos background of the host .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) we look at how the ldos evolves with @xmath133 exactly at the fano antiresonance @xmath134 . at the host site ( @xmath135 ) , the ldos presents a depletion .",
    "such a dip in the ldos is a result of charge screening around the impurities by conduction electrons , which suppresses the ldos of the host . beyond the adatom position ,",
    "the ldos is indeed dictated by friedel oscillations , which also lead to a strong decay in the long - range limit [ see the fig . [ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the evanescent feature of the ldos is a result of the interplay between the friedel - like expression @xmath136 and the fano parameter @xmath137 .",
    "these quantities are governed by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:_soma1 _ ] ) and ( [ eq : fano_j_2 ] ) , where the former evolves spatially according to the zeroth - order bessel function @xmath138 .",
    "such damping in the ldos has been already observed experimentally in a system composed by an fe host and a co adatom.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we plot the fano line shape in the long - range regime ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the same dips at @xmath140 and @xmath141 are observed as in the short - range limit [ fig . [",
    "fig2](a ) ] .",
    "however , a contrasting feature is found between these two limits . while in the short - range case the dips become suppressed as @xmath133 increases , in the long - range limit the dip oscillates with @xmath133 . this is a result of the oscillatory profile observed in the ldos for increasing @xmath133",
    "[ see fig . [ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the oscillations of the dip can be more clearly visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , where we show the ldos at @xmath134 . a peculiar beating",
    "is observed in the ldos due to the slightly different fermi wave numbers [ see eq . ( [ eq : kfs ] ) ] .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) shows the ldos plotted against energy for different @xmath133 values in the short - range limit . for the stm tip at @xmath135 ,",
    "the ldos shows the two - dip structure already observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath133 increases , the antiresonances change to resonances , passing through intermediate profiles ( asymmetric fano line shapes ) .",
    "we emphasize that this behavior in the ldos was recently observed in the experiment performed by prser _",
    "et al . _ with atoms of fe and co beneath the cu(100 ) surface.@xcite    we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) the evolution of the ldos with @xmath133 .",
    "non - evanescent oscillations occur , modulated by an amplitude beating .",
    "this undamped behavior is encoded by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : soma_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fano_1d ] ) , for friedel - like oscillations ( @xmath142 ) and fano interference ( @xmath69 ) , respectively .",
    "these quantities are simple trigonometric functions without damping .",
    "this feature is due to the absence of an extra dimension for the scattering of the electronic wave . on the other hand , in 2d this propagation",
    "is spread in a plane leading to a spatial decay in the ldos .",
    "thus the amplitude of the undamped beats is much larger than in the metallic surface device .",
    "this means that in such case , the ldos signal can be more easily resolved experimentally .",
    "another quantity we investigate is the spin - polarization given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp_full ] ) . as the differential conductance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dc ] ) is proportional to the ldos [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_ldos ] ) ] , the ferromagnetic hosts filter electrons that tunnels into ( or out of ) the stm tip . this filtering is dominated by the majority spin component .",
    "thus devices without impurities behave as spin filters with a spatially uniform polarization that coincides with the value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "here we adopt @xmath130 .",
    "due to the impurities in the side - coupled geometry and the host dimensionality , this polarization is perturbed in two different forms . in both the metallic surface and the quantum wire as we can see in figs .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](b ) with applied bias @xmath143 , the polarization oscillates around @xmath144 . unlike the metallic surface system , where small deviations with damping occur",
    ", the `` electron focusing '' effect in the quantum wire leads to undamped and pronounced oscillations .",
    "the polarization in the latter case does not exceed @xmath145 or fall below @xmath146 .",
    "therefore the polarized current through the junction formed by the stm tip and the surface alternates from spins up ( @xmath147 ) to down ( @xmath148 ) depending on the tip position .",
    "additionally , along this probing direction , the polarization not only can invert the orientation of the majority spin component , but also becomes zero at some sites , where locally the unbalance of spins is totally suppressed . as a result , we have a tunneling current without polarization in specific positions on the sample surface . on the other hand , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , the amplitude of the beats in the metallic surface polarization is extremely suppressed and does not change its signal @xmath149 .",
    "thus the quantum wire operates as a spatially resolved spin filter , with a higher efficiency .",
    "in order to investigate a ferromagnetic system with two impurities , we have calculated , the ldos and the spin polarization of hosts in two different dimensionalities .",
    "impurities in the side - coupled geometry , as outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : pic1 ] , were taken into account .",
    "we analyzed both a metallic surface and a quantum wire described by the two - impurity anderson model in the picture of a spin - polarized electron gas with impurities away from the kondo regime .",
    "we presented a model in which an unperturbed 1d electron host in the presence of localized states produces undamped behavior in the ldos fano profile [ see figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) ] , similar to that observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite in contrast , our 2d model revealed a damped oscillatory behavior [ figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , [ fig2](b ) , [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "we demonstrated that these opposed features originate from the interplay between the friedel - like function and the fano parameter , which assume different functional forms according to the host dimensionality . keeping the energy fixed and tuning the stm tip position",
    ", we verified the emergence of spin - polarized quantum beats in the ldos given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_ldos ] ) as well as in the transport polarization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp_full ] ) .",
    "such an effect is due to interference between the slightly different fermi wave numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 [ eq . ( [ eq : kfs ] ) ] in the ldos , achievable in hosts with low spin polarizations",
    ". therefore the quantum wire setup behaves as a spatially resolved spin - filter with a high efficiency , as we can see in fig . [ fig5](b ) .",
    "away from the adatom , this device can magnify or invert locally the original spin orientation of the host , also displaying sites where this polarization is completely quenched . as a possible experimental implementation of this apparatus , we suggest the systems investigated by prser .",
