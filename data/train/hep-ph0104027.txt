    "with the shutdown of the large electron  positron collider ( lep ) at cern , a crucial and glorious chapter of twentieth century physics has ended .",
    "thanks to the efforts of experimentalists and theorists all over the world , we are now able to make a definitive statement concerning our knowledge of the physical world : the standard model ( sm ) represents the correct description of fundamental interactions up to energies of @xmath2 . the fact that we know the right theory of fundamental interaction working at distances as small as @xmath3 m is a tremendous achievement .",
    "having emphasized this bright side of the last two decades , one has must also admit that the experimental and theoretical particle physics of these years has been rather unsuccessful in finding a road to follow beyond the sm . if we are all convinced that the sm can not be the ultimate theory of `` everything '' ( if only because it does not include gravity ) , we are in the dark about when , where and how new physics beyond the sm should manifest itself . searches for new particles and interactions in leptonic and hadronic machines have failed to produce results .",
    "theoretically , the most promising advances in recent years have led to theories ( strings , branes , etc ) which seem rather far from experimental tests .",
    "although the quest for new physics finds its most convincing answer in the traditional avenue of energies sufficient to produce and observe new particles , the lesson of recent decades has clearly indicated a second , indirect way of signalling the presence of new physics .",
    "we refer to the physics related to rare processes where flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and/or @xmath0 violation occur .",
    "as is well known , the first indications of the existence of charm and of a heavy top quark came before their direct discovery from evidence that indicated their role as virtual particles in @xmath4 and @xmath1 mixings , respectively .",
    "obviously rare processes are a privileged ground for indirect signals of new physics .",
    "one can hardly believe that new physics contributions can be observable when considering phenomena that arise at the tree level in the sm . on the contrary , fcnc and/or @xmath0 violating processes offer the possibility for loops containing new particles to compete with loops containing sm particles , thus allowing a fair chance for new physics to emerge against the `` sm background '' .",
    "we think that the indirect road to new physics will become particularly relevant in the next few years .",
    "as we said , high energy accelerators have established the sm as the correct @xmath5 theory , but they have not yet succeeded at the equally important task of observing some signals of new physics . after the end of lep , our attention in high energy accelerator physics turns to the upgraded tevatron at fermilab .",
    "the evidence from the late activity at lep in favor of a light higgs with a mass around @xmath6 feeds our hopes that a higgs signal may be detected at the tevatron .",
    "even if this were to occur , we would have only an indirect indication that new physics must be far below some grand unification scale ; the so  called `` big desert '' picture would be rejected ( we remind the reader that if the sm is valid up to some very large scale close to the planck scale the higgs mass should exceed @xmath7 ) .",
    "the class of sm extensions that goes under the name of low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) would be favored , although they certainly do not exhaust the possibilities for new physics with a light higgs . however ,",
    "unless superpartners are light , it might be difficult to establish their existence at the tevatron .",
    "if superpartners elude the tevatron , we will have to wait for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern to operate before deciding `` directly '' whether low energy susy is a reality or just an intriguing intellectual construction",
    ".    what can we do to search for new physics in the meantime ? . here",
    "is where the fcnc and/or @xmath0 violating processes come into full play in our challenging ( sometimes desperate ) effort to find hints of new physics .",
    "two brand ",
    "new @xmath1 factories have just started operating , and there are plans for new experiments in rare kaon decays , in testing the electric dipole moments , in flavor violating leptonic processes , etc",
    ". the enormous and interesting project of probing the sm in rare processes will proceed at full speed in the pre ",
    "lhc epoch .",
    "it is important to critically discuss strategies to look for new physics in such processes .",
    "our goal here is to report on some of the most relevant aspects of the search for some signal of departure from the sm expectations in @xmath0 violating phenomena .",
    "admittedly , even if we find such signals it will be hard to establish what new physics is responsible for them .",
    "however , we indicate how , at least in the specific framework of low energy susy , the combination of several observations may shed important light on the new physics , hence directing direct searches towards specific targets .",
    "we refer to `` fcnc and/or @xmath0 violation '' in qualifying the interesting processes for indirect detection of new physics because we can consider three different classes of them : ( a ) phenomena that require fcnc but occur even without @xmath0 violation as @xmath4@xmath8 or @xmath1@xmath9 mixing ; ( b ) @xmath0 violating processes without fcnc , namely electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the neutron , electron , etc ; and finally , ( c ) simultaneous fcnc and @xmath0 violating phenomena , for instance the quantities @xmath10 or @xmath11 in @xmath4 decays into pions and the @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath1 decays",
    ".    in our view , among these three classes of rare processes , those related to the presence of @xmath0 violation deserve a special attention for at least three reasons .    1 .",
    "after nearly four decades of intensive experimental and theoretical work @xmath0 violation still appears rather mysterious and , hence , a potentially good candidate to offer surprises in future tests ( for general and recent reviews on @xmath0 violation see @xcite ) .",
    "we recently witnessed two major breakthroughs in our understanding of @xmath0 violation .",
    "first , from the measurements @xcite of the @xmath11 parameters from both sides of the atlantic , we got the information that @xmath0 violation occurs not only in @xmath4@xmath8 mixing ( @xmath12 ) , but also in the direct @xmath4 decay amplitudes ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "hence we can definitely reject the idea that @xmath0 violation arises only from some specific superweak interactions in processes that change strangeness by two units .",
    "the second relevant piece of information , which we obtained last year , is that @xmath0 violation is not present exclusively in the kaon system ; there exists at least one other place where it shows up , namely in @xmath1 physics .",
    "this evidence emerged from the measurement of the @xmath0 asymmetry in the decays of @xmath1 into @xmath14 in three different experiments : @xmath15 at babar @xcite , @xmath16 at belle @xcite and @xmath17 at cdf @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , although the measurement coming from cdf confirms the sm expectation for such asymmetry , the results from the two abovementioned @xmath1 factories indicate central values significantly lower than the sm expectations .",
    "the errors are still quite large and so the best advice is the usual `` wait and see '' , but this example illustrates how surprises in the @xmath0 exploration can be lurking around the corner .",
    "2 .   from the theoretical point of view , it is important to emphasize that new physics beyond the sm generically introduces new sources of @xmath0 violation in addition to the usual ckm phase of the sm .",
    "indeed , it is a common experience of model builders that if one tries to extend the sm with some low energy new physics one must somehow control the proliferation of new @xmath0 violating contributions .",
    "significant portions of the parameter spaces of new physics models can generally be ruled out by the severe constraints imposed by @xmath0 violating phenomena @xcite .",
    "for instance , as we discuss bellow , even if one considers the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm that passes all the fcnc tests unscathed , one still faces severe problems in matching the experimental results concerning processes with @xmath0 violation , especially the constraints coming from the various bounds on electric dipole moments .",
    "the third reason which makes us optimistic in having new physics playing a major role in @xmath0 violation concerns the matter ",
    "antimatter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "starting from a baryon ",
    "antibaryon symmetric universe , the sm is unable to account for the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "the presence of new @xmath0violating contributions beyond the sm looks crucial to produce an efficient mechanism for the generation of a satisfactory @xmath18 asymmetry .    the aim of this article is to discuss the above points with the goal of exploring the potentialities of @xmath0 violation in our quest for new physics .",
    "because of the vastness of the subject , we focus on a promising class of new physics that goes under the generic name of low energy susy @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that low energy susy does not denote a well defined model ; rather , it includes a variety of sm extensions ( with a variety of phenomenological implications ) .",
    "we characterize this huge class of models according to their main features in relation to @xmath0 violation .",
    "we want to avoid losing our readers in endless `` botanic '' classifications of susy models , but we also want to avoid the idea that one can discuss @xmath0 violation in `` the '' susy model as if one were discussing a specific construction such as the sm .    as appealing as low energy susy may appear , at least to some physicists , one should not forget that after more than twenty years of searches we do not have any experimental hint of susy particles .",
    "furthermore , one could argue theoretically that the idea that superpartners appear on the tev scale is motivated only by the hope that susy resolves the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the unification of the gauge couplings when low energy susy particles are included in their running can be considered only circumstantial evidence in favor of susy . in spite of all this",
    ", our choice to stick to low energy susy for most of this article in exploring the impact of @xmath0 violation on new physics is justified by a simple and uncontroversial fact : we do not know of any other `` complete '' model of new physics that tackles the gauge hierarchy problem and successfully passes the impressive list of direct and indirect experimental tests of new physics . in any case , in the final part of this article we comment on @xmath0 violation in other alternative possibilities for new physics .",
    "our discussion follows the general lines of distinction between @xmath0 violating processes with and without fcnc that we underlined above . in the next section we focus on @xmath0 violation in the electric dipole moments ( hence without fcnc )",
    "and we introduce the first aspect of what is called the `` susy @xmath0 problem '' .",
    "then in section 3 we move to flavor changing @xmath0 violation in susy and we deal with the second aspect of the susy @xmath0 problem .",
    "section 4 is devoted to an overview of @xmath0 violation in other extensions of the sm . finally in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions and outlook .",
    "before entering the more specific discussion of the next sections , we offer a quick overview on @xmath0 violation in susy at a more introductory level .    when one decides to supersymmetrize the sm one has many options @xcite .",
    "first , the fields of the sm are embedded into superfields containing also the susy partners of each known particle ; but how many superfields should one introduce ? here",
    "we stick to the minimal option : we introduce the minimal amount of superfields that are strictly demanded to obtain a viable supersymmetrization of the sm .",
    "this means that each particle will be accompanied by a superpartner , except in the higgs sector where we have to introduce a second higgs doublet in addition to the usual sm higgs doublet .",
    "some models introduce new singlet superfields or even more complicate structures , and such models may have new sources of @xmath0 violation .",
    "a second important limitation in the class of susy models that we consider here concerns the imposition of @xmath19 parity .",
    "this discrete symmetry is usually added to the gauge and super  symmetries in order to prevent excessive baryon and lepton number violations .",
    "although some symmetry must indeed be imposed to inhibit proton decay , @xmath19 parity is not the only way to achieve this .",
    "a vast class of alternative models imposes some discrete symmetry other than @xmath19 , allowing for either baryon or lepton number violations .",
    "in such models , many new yukawa couplings exist and then the number of @xmath0 violating phases of the theory is sizeably increased .    even in minimal supersymmetric versions of the sm ( mssm ) where the minimal number of superfields is introduced and @xmath19 parity is imposed , one is still left with more than 100 free parameters , almost half of them given by @xmath0 violating phases @xcite .",
    "fortunately most of this huge parameter space is already phenomenologically ruled out .",
    "indeed , fcnc and @xmath0 violating processes play a major rule in drastically reducing the parameter space .",
    "obviously it is difficult to make phenomenological predictions with so many free parameters , and so through the years many theoretical further restrictions have been envisaged for the mssm class .",
    "the most drastic reduction on the susy parameter space leads to what is called the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) or minimal supergravity @xcite . in the absence of phases ,",
    "this model is characterized by only four parameters plus the sign of a fifth parameter .    in any mssm , at least two new `` genuine '' susy @xmath0violating phases are present .",
    "they originate from the susy parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath1 .",
    "the first of these parameters is the dimensionful coefficient of the @xmath23 term of the superpotential .",
    "the remaining three parameters are present in the sector that softly breaks the @xmath24 global susy .",
    "@xmath21 denotes the common value of the gaugino masses , @xmath22 is the trilinear scalar coupling , and @xmath1 denotes the bilinear scalar coupling . in our notation , all these three parameters are dimensionful . the simplest way to see which combinations of the phases of these four parameters are physical @xcite is to notice that for vanishing values of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath1 the theory possesses two additional symmetries @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath20 are set to zero , a @xmath25 peccei  quinn symmetry emerges , which in particular rotates @xmath26 and @xmath27 . if @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath1 are set to zero , the lagrangian acquires a continuous @xmath25 @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "then we can consider @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath1 as spurions that break the @xmath28 and @xmath29 symmetries . in this way",
    ", the question concerning the number and nature of the meaningful phases translates into the problem of finding the independent combinations of the four parameters that are invariant under @xmath28 and @xmath29 and determining their independent phases .",
    "there are three such independent combinations , but only two of their phases are independent .",
    "we use here the commonly adopted choice : @xmath30 where also @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 .    the main constraints on the susy phases come from their contribution to the electric dipole moments of the neutron and of the electron .",
    "for instance , the effect of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the electric and chromoelectric dipole moments of the light quarks ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) leads to a contribution to @xmath38 of order @xcite    @xmath39    where @xmath40 here denotes a common mass for sleptons and gauginos .",
    "the present experimental bound , @xmath41 e cm , implies that @xmath42 should be @xmath43 , unless one pushes susy masses up to @xmath44(1 tev ) .",
    "a possible caveat to such an argument calling for a fine  tuning of @xmath42 is that uncertainties in the estimate of the hadronic matrix elements could relax the severe bound in equation  [ edmnmssm ] @xcite .",
    "these considerations lead most authors dealing with the mssm to simply put @xmath33 and @xmath34 equal to zero .",
    "actually , one may argue in favor of this choice by considering the soft breaking sector of the mssm as resulting from susy breaking mechanisms that force @xmath33 and @xmath34 to vanish .",
    "for instance , it is conceivable that both @xmath22 and @xmath21 originate from one source of @xmath29 breaking . since @xmath33 measures the relative phase of @xmath22 and @xmath21 , in this case it would `` naturally '' vanish .",
    "in some specific models , it has been shown @xcite that through an analogous mechanism @xmath34 may also vanish .    in recent years , the attitude towards the edm problem in susy and the consequent suppression of the susy phases has significantly changed .",
    "indeed , options have been envisaged allowing for a conveniently suppressed susy contribution to the edm even in the presence of large ( sometimes maximal ) susy phases .",
    "methods of suppressing the edms consist of cancellation of various susy contributions among themselves @xcite , non universality of the soft breaking parameters at the unification scale @xcite and approximately degenerate heavy sfermions for the first two generations @xcite . in the presence of one of these mechanisms ,",
    "large supersymmetric phases are expected yet edms should be generally close to the experimental bounds . in the following",
    "we discuss the implications of these new @xmath0 violating phases that may be present in susy , keeping in mind that some of the above mechanisms may be required to satisfy the constraints coming from the edm s .",
    "despite of the large sensitivity of edms to the presence of new phases , so far only neutral meson systems , @xmath45@xmath46 or @xmath47@xmath48 , show measurable effects of @xmath0 violation .",
    "this fact is , at first sight , surprising because in the neutral mesons @xmath0 violation is associated with a change in flavor and hence is ckm suppressed , whereas edms are completely independent of flavor mixing .",
    "the reason for this is that , in the sm , @xmath0 violation is intimately related to flavor , to the extent that observable @xmath0 violation requires , not only a phase in the ckm mixing matrix , but also three non  degenerate families of quarks @xcite .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the supersymmetrized sm contains new sources of @xmath0 , both flavor independent or flavor dependent .",
    "although the new phases are , in principle , strongly constrained by the edm experimental limits , we have seen that several mechanisms allow us to satisfy these constrains with large supersymmetric phases .",
    "next , we analyze this possibility and the effects in flavor changing @xmath0 violation observables .",
    "we first concentrate on a mssm with a flavor blind susy breaking , and then we study a general mssm in which the soft breaking terms include all kinds of new flavor structures .",
    "the first step in our review of supersymmetric @xmath0 violation is the analysis of a mssm with flavor blind susy breaking .",
    "blind refers to a softly broken supersymmetric sm in which the soft breaking terms do not introduce any new flavor structure beyond the yukawa matrices whose presence in the superpotential is required to reproduce correctly the fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "supersymmetry is broken at a large scale , that we identify with @xmath49 , and from here , the parameters evolve with the standard mssm renormalization group equations ( rge ) @xcite down to the electro  weak scale . in these conditions",
    "the most general allowed structure of the soft  breaking terms at @xmath49 is , @xmath50 where all the allowed phases are explicitly written except possible phases in the yukawa matrices that give rise to an observable phase in the the ckm matrix , @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , in this flavor blind mssm , @xmath51 is the only physical phase in the yukawa matrices and all other phases in @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be rephased away in the same way as in the sm .",
    "the absence of flavor structure in the scalar sector means that quarks and squarks can be rotated parallel already at the gut scale and hence only @xmath51 survives .",
    "this is not true in the presence of new flavor structures , where additional yukawa phases can not be rephased away from quark ",
    "squark couplings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also assume unification of gaugino masses at @xmath49 and the universal gaugino mass can always be taken as real .",
    "the soft breaking terms structure in equation  [ soft ] includes , as the simplest example , the cmssm where all scalar masses and @xmath22terms are universal and the number of parameters is reduced to 6 real parameters once we require radiative symmetry breaking , ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath34 , @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "more general soft  breaking terms in the absence of new flavor structures can arise in gut models @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a @xmath58 model , we expect common masses for the particles in the @xmath59 and in the @xmath60 multiplets , and , in general , different masses for the two higgses .",
    "the new parameters in the soft  breaking sector would then be ( @xmath54 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath57 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) @xcite .",
    "we take this structure as a representative example of equation  [ soft ] , since it already shares all the relevant features . in any case , although the number of parameters is significantly increased with respect to the cmssm , it can still be managed and a full rge evolution and analysis of the low  energy spectrum is possible .    in this framework , we consider susy effects on flavor changing @xmath0 violation and , in particular , the @xmath0 asymmetry in the @xmath70 decay , @xmath71 and @xmath47 @xmath0 asymmetries .",
    "however , we include also two @xmath0 conserving observables that are relevant in the fit of the unitarity triangle , namely @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "all these processes receive two qualitatively different supersymmetric contributions .",
    "as shown in the previous section , supersymmetry introduces new @xmath0 violation phases that can strongly modify these observables through their effects in susy loops . on the other hand ,",
    "even with vanishing susy phases , the presence of the ckm phase in loops containing susy particles induces new contributions that modify the sm predictions for these observables .",
    "concerning the first possibility , we consider the following extreme situation : we analyze the effects of both @xmath34 and a flavor independent @xmath33 in flavor changing @xmath0 violation experiments , ignoring completely ( as a first step ) edm bounds .",
    "the result looks rather surprising at first sight : _ in the absence of the ckm phase , a general mssm with all possible phases in the soft  breaking terms , but no new flavor structure beyond the usual yukawa matrices , can never give a sizeable contribution to @xmath71 , @xmath11 or hadronic @xmath47 @xmath0 asymmetries _",
    "it is possible to understand the main reasons for this behavior ( see @xcite for a complete discussion ) . in a flavor",
    "blind mssm , all scalar masses are flavor universal at @xmath49 .",
    "after rge evolution any off  diagonal entry in these matrices is necessarily proportional to a product of at least two yukawa matrix elements , which finally can be translated into a quark mass squared and two ckm matrix elements , plus a loop factor .",
    "thus , these @xmath74 or @xmath75 sfermion matrices remain diagonal and real in very good approximation .",
    "a similar situation takes place in the trilinear matrices : at @xmath76 , they continue to remain proportional to the corresponding yukawa matrix up to small rge corrections of the same kind , so they are nearly diagonalized in the basis of diagonal quark yukawas . in summary , the situation in the sfermion mass matrices is exactly analogous to the constrained mssm , and even though the @xmath77 matrices are complex , flavor off  diagonal elements are negligible .",
    "hence , gluino and neutralino contributions are too small once we take into account the lower bounds on squark and gaugino masses .",
    "the remaining possibility is chargino loops where the necessary flavor change is provided by the usual ckm mixing matrix . in this case",
    ", we have both chirality conserving and chirality changing transitions .",
    "it is easy to prove @xcite that in the limit of flavor diagonal sfermion masses and a real ckm matrix , the chirality conserving chargino contributions are exactly real , irrespective of the phases in the squark and chargino mixings .",
    "therefore , only chirality changing chargino loops could give rise to a supersymmetric contribution proportional to the new susy phases .",
    "still , in the case of kaon physics , these contributions are suppressed by the square of the @xmath37 quark yukawa coupling and then completely negligible with respect to the experimentally measured value . in the @xmath1 system",
    "we could argue that the @xmath78 yukawa coupling can be large @xcite .",
    "however , these transitions are closely related to the decay @xmath79 ; constraints from this decay render the chargino chirality changing transitions negligible @xcite . in other words , the effects of susy phases in a flavor blind mssm are restricted in practice to @xmath77 transitions , such as the edm or the @xmath0 asymmetry in the @xmath80 decay , and the effects in observables with dominant chirality conserving contributions are negligible even with maximal susy phases .",
    "accordingly , the most interesting @xmath0 violation observable in these conditions is probably the @xmath0 asymmetry in the @xmath70 decay .",
    "however , we must take into account that the branching ratio itself is a very strong constraint in any susy model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 asymmetry is defined as , @xmath81 where the different @xmath82 are the wilson coefficients of the current  current , @xmath83 , magnetic , @xmath84 , and chromomagnetic , @xmath85 , dipole operators , evaluated at the scale @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is predicted to be below @xmath87 in the sm  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have seen that the new susy phases can modify the @xmath70 transition significantly .",
    "in fact , several studies showed that the mssm in the presence of large @xmath34 and @xmath33 can enhance the @xmath0 asymmetry up to @xmath88 @xcite which could be easily accessible at @xmath1 factories .",
    "in any case , it is important to remember that this scenario is viable only if some mechanism reduces the susy contributions to the edm . in the case of the cmssm or a flavor blind mssm with possible edm cancellations",
    "this analysis was repeated in @xcite and the asymmetry can reach at most a few per cent .",
    "figure 1 shows that without edm constraints ( open grey circles ) the asymmetry can be above @xmath89 at any value of the branching ratio and can reach even @xmath90 for low branching ratios . in figure 1",
    "the points of the parameter space that fulfill edm constraints are represented by black dots .",
    "the effect on the @xmath0 asymmetry can be sizeable at low values of the branching ratio @xcite , but for larger values of the branching ratio the asymmetry is again around @xmath91 . in the plot ,",
    "the points of the parameter space fulfilling edm constraints are represented by black dots .",
    "[ fig : acp ] = 0.9    still , even with @xmath92 , susy loops can modify the amplitudes proportional to the ckm phase . indeed ,",
    "in a flavor blind mssm , gluino and neutralino exchange contributions to fcnc are subleading with respect to chargino ( @xmath93 ) and charged higgs ( @xmath94 ) exchanges .",
    "this simply reflects the absence of flavor mixing at tree level in gluino and neutralino contributions , whereas ckm mixing is present in the chargino and charged higgs contributions .",
    "hence , when dealing with @xmath0 violating fcnc processes in these models , we can confine the analysis to @xmath93 and @xmath94 loops .",
    "this scenario was analyzed @xcite soon after the heavy top quark discovery opening the possibility of relatively light stops , and more recently in reference @xcite .",
    "specifically , these works analyze the effects of a minimal flavor violation mssm at the electroweak scale .",
    "that is , they consider an mssm with the ckm matrix as the only source of flavor mixing even at the scale @xmath95 .",
    "however , although they apply all the relevant low energy constraints , they do not consider the rge effects in the evolution of the soft  breaking terms and hence they take sparticle masses as completely unrelated .    our point of view here is more restricted and we follow the analysis of reference @xcite , where the flavor blind conditions are specified at a large scale @xmath49 and the standard mssm rges @xcite are used to evolve the initial conditions down to the electroweak scale .",
    "we consider two representative examples of flavor blind mssm , the cmssm as the simplest model and the @xmath58 inspired model defined above .",
    "hence , we are mainly interested in the following part of the low energy spectrum : @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "their masses are evolved to @xmath95 and then , all the relevant experimental constraints are imposed :    * absence of charge and color breaking minima and directions unbounded from below @xcite . * lower bounds on masses from direct searches",
    "@xcite , in particular @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . * branching ratio of the @xmath70 decay @xcite .",
    "* neutralino as the lightest supersymmetric particle .    in this way",
    ", the complete supersymmetric spectrum at the electroweak scale is obtained in terms of 6 or 11 parameters in the cmssm or su(5 ) inspired model respectively . within a mssm scenario ,",
    "this kind of analysis was first made in the work of bertolini et al .",
    "@xcite and has been updated several times since then @xcite .",
    "we follow bartl et al .",
    "@xcite , who developed a specialized study of the spectrum relevant for fcnc and @xmath0 violation experiments . indeed , the most interesting point of this work is the strong correlation among different susy masses that have a strong impact on low energy fcnc and @xmath0 violation studies .",
    "[ fig : charstop ] = 0.9 = 0.9    figure 2 shows scatter plots of the mass of the lightest chargino versus the lightest stop mass . in these plots",
    "we vary the scalar and gaugino masses at @xmath49 as @xmath103 , the trilinear terms as @xmath104 with arbitrary phases and @xmath105 .",
    "it is interesting to notice in this plot the very strong correlation among the chargino and stop masses .",
    "in fact , this correlation can be easily understood with the help of the one  loop rge @xcite .",
    "neglecting for the moment the so  called d - terms and the small radiatively generated intergenerational squark mixing , we get for the stop masses : @xmath106 in terms of the soft parameters at the electroweak scale . thanks to the proximity of the top quark mass to its quasi  fixed point and the relative smallness of @xmath107 for @xmath108 , we can express equation  [ eq : stopmass1 ] as a function of the initial parameters at @xmath49 with only a small variation of the coefficients with @xmath109 . in the cmssm case",
    "we find : @xmath110 moreover , in the cmssm @xmath111 is always larger than @xmath112 and hence , the lightest chargino is predominantly gaugino .",
    "then we can replace the initial gaugino mass in terms of the lightest chargino mass and finally get , @xmath113 from this equation , we obtain for @xmath114 and with @xmath115 a maximal allowed range for the lightest stop mass of @xmath116 .",
    "as figure 2 shows , this correlation is maintained for larger chargino masses .",
    "in the case of @xmath58 , the main difference is the fact that the higgs masses are not tied to the other scalar masses and now may be quite different .",
    "this has important effects on the radiative symmetry breaking and in fact , lower values of @xmath20 are possible such that the lightest chargino can have a predominant higgsino component . in the rare scenarios where @xmath117 , the stop masses are somewhat lower than for the cmssm case .",
    "anyhow , as we can see in figure 2 , a strong correlation is still maintained .",
    "we must emphasize that , due to gluino dominance in the soft  term evolution , this kind of correlation is general in any rge evolved mssm from some gut initial conditions , assuming that gaugino masses unify as well . in summary , this implies that the `` light stop and chargino '' scenario in any gut evolved mssm must be shifted to stop masses on the range of @xmath118 and chargino masses of @xmath5 .",
    "a very similar correlation can be obtained for other squark masses , roughly , @xmath119    finally , we discuss the charged higgs  boson mass . in figure 3 , we show a scatter plot of the mass of the charged higgs boson versus the value of @xmath57 for the cmssm and the su(5 ) examples .",
    "the main features here are the fact that , for low @xmath120 , the masses of the charged higgs  boson are above @xmath121 , and that specially in the cmssm case , most of these light higgs  boson masses are eliminated by the @xmath70 constraint . for larger values of @xmath57",
    "slightly lighter masses are allowed , but it is still true that we seldom find charged higgs masses below @xmath122 in any case .",
    "the reason for this is again the gluino dominance in the rge .",
    "for instance , at @xmath123 the charged higgs is @xmath124 and at @xmath125 , @xmath126 , from the one  loop rge @xcite .",
    "[ fig : h+ ] = 0.9 = 0.9    taking into account the relevant features of the mssm spectrum discussed above , we can discuss the susy contribution in a flavor blind scenario to the different @xmath0 violating observables .",
    "first , the @xmath127 @xmath0 asymmetry has already been discussed in the presence of large supersymmetric phases that survive the edm constraints through a cancellation mechanism . in that case , the asymmetry could reach a few percent ; however , with vanishing susy phases we again obtain an asymmetry in the range of the sm value , well below @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is found in @xmath11 where the susy contributions tend to lower the sm prediction @xcite .",
    "second , the @xmath128 observables , i.e @xmath71 and @xmath47@xmath48 mixing which play a fundamental role in the unitarity triangle fit , are also modified by new susy contributions . taking into account the new susy contributions ,",
    "the sm fit of the unitarity triangle is modified and one obtains different restrictions on the @xmath129 and @xmath130 parameters of the ckm matrix .",
    "moreover this fit has to be compatible with the new direct measurements of the @xmath47 @xmath0 asymmetries @xcite . as explained elsewhere",
    "@xcite , given that the susy contributions tend to interfere constructively with the sm with a factorized ckm dependence , this implies that for a given susy contribution the values of @xmath130 required to saturate @xmath131 are now smaller .",
    "the value of @xmath132 required to saturate @xmath72 is analogously decreased .",
    "hence , it is evident that the addition of susy tends to lower the values of @xmath130 and increase the values of @xmath129 in the fit , therefore reducing the actual value of @xmath133 in the direction of the recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "however , as shown by buras & buras @xcite , in any minimal flavor violation model at the electroweak scale , a strong correlation exists among the @xmath134 contributions to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and this allows only a small departure of @xmath135 from the sm prediction .",
    "still , different values of @xmath136 and @xmath137 are , in principle , allowed .",
    "nevertheless , as shown above , the relative heaviness @xcite of the susy spectrum implies that the deviation from the standard model fit in these models tends to be small for these angles . in summary",
    ", a flavor blind mssm can not generate large deviations from the sm expectations in the @xmath47 @xmath0 asymmetries @xcite .",
    "flavor universality of the soft susy breaking is a strong assumption and is known not to be true in many supergravity and string  inspired models @xcite . in these models , a non trivial flavor structure in the squark mass matrices or trilinear terms",
    "is generically obtained at the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "hence , sizeable flavor off ",
    "diagonal entries appear in the squark mass matrices , and new fcnc and @xmath0 violation effects can be expected .",
    "in fact , most of these flavor off  diagonal entries are severely constrained or even ruled  out by low energy fcnc and @xmath0 violation observables .",
    "a very convenient parameterization of the susy effects in these rare processes is the so  called mass insertion approximation @xcite .",
    "it is defined in the super ckm ( sckm ) basis at the electroweak scale , where all the couplings of sfermions to neutral gauginos are flavor diagonal . in this basis , the sfermion mass matrices are not diagonal .",
    "the sfermion propagators , now flavor off  diagonal , can be expanded as a series in terms of @xmath138 , where @xmath139 denotes the off ",
    "diagonal terms in the sfermion mass matrices , with @xmath140 an average sfermion mass @xcite . as a result ,",
    "fcnc and @xmath0 violation constraints can be expressed as model  independent upper bounds on these mass insertions at the electroweak scale and they can readily be compared with the corresponding mass insertions calculated in a well defined susy model .",
    "a complete analysis of this kind was performed ( see @xcite for a more complete discussion ) and the constraints from @xmath12 processes were later updated @xcite . in the following , we present the phenomenological constraints from @xcite .    the main constraints on @xmath0 violating mass insertions ( with non ",
    "vanishing phases ) come from @xmath71 , @xmath11 and edms , although `` indirect '' constraints from @xmath70 and @xmath1@xmath9 mixing are also relevant .",
    "these constraints are presented in tables [ imds2 ] to [ redb2 ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize the strong sensitivity of @xmath11 to @xmath141 and of @xmath71 to @xmath142 , which implies that it is difficult to saturate both simultaneously with a single mass insertion @xcite .",
    "what message should we draw from the constraints in tables [ imds2][redb2 ] ?",
    "first , it is apparent that fcnc and especially @xmath0 violating processes represent a significant test for susy extensions of the sm . taking arbitrary sfermion mass matrices",
    "completely unrelated to the fermion mass matrices would lead to mass insertions of order unity .",
    "consequently , the first conclusion we draw from the small numbers in tables [ imds2][redb2 ] is that there must be some close relation between the flavor structures of the sfermion and fermion sectors .",
    "large portions of the parameter spaces of minimal susy models are completely ruled out thanks to the severity of the fcnc and @xmath0 constraints .",
    "but then an even more important question emerges after one stares at tables [ imds2][redb2 ] : given the strong constraints from fcnc and @xmath0 violating processes that we have already observed , can we still hope to see susy signals in other rare processes ?",
    "in particular , restricting this question to @xmath0 violation , can we still hope to find a significant disagreement with the sm expectations when we measure @xmath0 violation in various b decay channels ?",
    "fortunately for us , the answer to this last question is yes . for example , it has been shown @xcite that considering the @xmath0 asymmetry in several b decay channels , which in the sm would give just the same answer ( the angle @xmath133 of the unitarity triangle ) , it is possible to obtain different values when susy effects are switched on .",
    "susy contributions to some of the decay amplitudes can be as high as 70@xmath143 with respect to the sm contribution , whereas other decay channels are not affected at all by the susy presence .",
    "hence , assuming large @xmath0 violating phases in susy , one could find discrepancies with the sm expectations that are larger than any reasonable theoretical hadronic uncertainty in the sm computation .",
    "we refer the interested reader to reference @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the above example shows that there is still room for sizeable susy signals in @xmath0 violating processes , but this represents some kind of `` maximal hope '' of what we can expect from susy . in other words , one takes the maximally allowed values of relevant @xmath144 s to maximize the possible susy deviations from sm on @xmath0 observables .",
    "a different question is what we can `` typically '' expect in a susy model .",
    "as we stressed in the introduction , no `` typical '' susy model exists ; what we call low  energy susy represents a vast class of models .",
    "yet it makes sense to try to identify some features of minimal susy models where no drastic departures from flavor universality are taken and to consider in this more restricted context what we can expect .",

    "the ckm phase can be quite small , leading to a lower @xmath228 @xmath0 asymmetry @xcite .",
    "so far , we have reviewed @xmath0 violation in susy as a particularly appealing extension of the sm . in this last section",

    "extensions with additional down quarks in a vector  like representation of the sm are free from these problems and are especially interesting from the @xmath0 phenomenology point of view .",
    "these models naturally arise , for instance , as the low energy limit of an @xmath232 grand unified theory . at a more phenomenological level ,",
    "models with isosinglet quarks provide the simplest self  consistent framework to study deviations of @xmath233 unitarity of the ckm matrix , as well as fcnc at tree level .",
    "the extra vector  like quarks mix with the three ordinary down quarks giving rise to a @xmath234 mixing matrix , out of which the @xmath235 upper submatrix corresponds to the ckm matrix in charged currents . in this extended matrix ,",
    "new observable phases arise and , through unitarity , produce complex tree level fcnc couplings in the @xmath236 and higgs vertices .",
    "the fact that the experimental bounds on ckm mixings allow a larger mixing with the third generation quarks implies that despite the tight constraints from other fcnc processes @xcite , these tree level fcncs are able to modify significantly the sm prediction for @xmath47 @xmath0 asymmetries @xcite .",
    "indeed , these models are even able to reproduce low asymmetries in the lower range of the recent babar result @xcite .",
    "many sm extensions , include additional scalar multiplets @xcite .",
    "these models have additional yukawa couplings , as well as scalar self ",
    "interactions that introduce many new sources of @xmath0 violation . however , a generic model suffers from severe phenomenological problems that are solved with the requirement of extra symmetries @xcite .",
    "for example , the higgs sector of the mssm , discussed in previous sections is an example of a two  higgs doublet model with natural flavor conservation @xcite , this means that each higgs doublet couples to a different fermion sector . in this case",
    ", the only new ingredient is the presence of a physical charged higgs with ckm couplings . in some cases ,",
    "it is also possible that the neutral scalars are mixtures of @xmath0 even and @xmath0 odd fields @xcite .",
    "this mixing shows up mainly in edm s , @xmath70 , and top quark decays .",
    "an enlargement of the gauge group to include , for instance a left ",
    "right symmetric theory is also a very attractive extension of the sm @xcite . concerning @xmath0 violation , it is especially interesting that these models can accommodate spontaneous @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "the relative phases among neutral higgs vacuum expectation values are the only source of @xmath0 violation here .",
    "actually , a single phase enters the charged fermion mass matrices giving rise to six physical phases in these matrices .",
    "this is the only source for @xmath0 violation at low energy , in a very predictive scheme .",
    "in fact , the rephasing invariant phase of the ( left  handed ) ckm matrix is small @xcite .",
    "hence , an extra contribution from right  handed bosons is required to saturate the experimental bound in @xmath71 .",
    "this , in turn , translates into an upper bound on the mass of the right  handed boson . in a similar way",
    ", there can be sizeable new contributions in @xmath1@xmath9 mixing from the phases in the right  handed mixing matrix and consequently , the @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath1 decays may be significantly different from the sm expectations @xcite .",
    "here we summarize the main points in our review :    * there exist strong theoretical and `` observational '' reasons to go beyond the sm . *",
    "the gauge hierarchy and coupling unification problems favor the presence of low  energy susy ( either in its minimal version , cmssm , or more naturally , in some less constrained realization ) .",
    "* flavor and @xmath0 problems constrain low  energy susy , but , at the same time , provide new tools to search for susy indirectly . * in general , we expect new @xmath0 violating phases in the susy sector . however , these new phases are not going to produce sizeable effects as long as the susy model we consider does not exhibit a new flavor structure in addition to the sm yukawa matrices . * in the presence of a new flavor structure in susy , large contributions to @xmath0 violating observables are indeed possible . *",
    "@xmath0 violation is also very sensitive to the presence of other low energy extensions of the sm .",
    "maybe a reader who has followed us up to this point would like to have a final assessment about the chances of having some signals of the presence of low energy susy in fcnc and @xmath0 violating processes .",
    "it should be clear from our discussion that the answer heavily depends on the presence or absence of a link between the mechanism which is responsible for the flavor structure of the theory and the mechanism originating the breaking and transmission of susy .",
    "if no link is present ( flavor blind susy ) , there exists quite a few especial places where we can hope to `` see '' susy in action : the edms , the @xmath237 , and , as it emerged recently , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon . on the other hand , in the more general ( and , in our view ,",
    "also more likely ) case where , indeed , susy breaking is not insensitive to the flavor mechanism , there exist a rich variety of fcnc and @xmath0 violation potentialities for susy to show up .",
    "as we have seen , @xmath4 and @xmath1 physics offer appealing possibilities : @xmath71 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 violating rare kaon decays , @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath1 decays , rare @xmath1 decays  .",
    "in fact , we think that the relevance of susy searches in rare processes is not confined to the usually quoted possibility that indirect searches can arrive `` first '' , before direct searches ( tevatron and lhc ) , in signaling the presence of susy . even after the possible direct production and observation of susy particles , the importance of fcnc and @xmath0 violation in testing susy remains of utmost relevance .",

    "<S> most extensions of the sm exhibit new sources of @xmath0 violation . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the truly minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( cmssm ) has two new phases in addition to the ckm phase . </S>",
    "<S> given that @xmath0 violation is so tiny in the kaon system , is still largely unexplored in @xmath1 physics and is negligibly small in the electric dipole moments , it is clear that new physics may have a good chance to manifest some departure from the sm in this particularly challenging class of rare phenomena . on the other hand , it is also apparent that @xmath0 violation generally represents a major constraint on any attempt at model building beyond the sm . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we tackle these two sides of the relation between @xmath0 violation and new physics </S>",
    "<S> . our focus will be on the potentialities to use @xmath0 violation as a probe on supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to clarify the extent to which such indirect signals for susy are linked to a fundamental theoretical issue : is there a relation between the mechanism that originates the whole flavor structure and the mechanism that is responsible for the breaking of supersymmetry ? </S>",
