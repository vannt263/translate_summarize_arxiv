    "in a series of recent papers new interest has grown in the problem of finding the most general solution to the spherically symmetric equations of general relativity , including matter .",
    "many of these papers deal with anisotropic matter states .",
    "anisotropic matter - in a spherically symmetric context - is a ( new ) state of matter , for which the principal pressure components in the radial and tangential directions differ . note that an anisotropic pressure is fully compatible with spherical symmetry , a fact that appears to have been overlooked by some of the old papers .",
    "one of the causes for this newly awakened interest could be the realization , that models with anisotropic pressure appear to have the potential to soften up the conditions under which spherically symmetric collapse necessarily proceeds to a singularity . another motivation for the renewed interest might be the prospect of the new physics that will have to be developed in order to understand the peculiar properties of matter in a state of highly anisotropic pressure and to determine the conditions according to which such matter - states develop .    the study of anisotropic matter states on a large scale might also become relevant from recent cosmological observations .",
    "it is well known , that the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) contains a dipole with a direction pointing roughly to the virgo cluster .",
    "the common explanation for this anisotropy is the relative motion of the earth with respect to the preferred rest - frame of the universe , which is identified with the frame in which the cmbr appears spherically symmetric . yet despite years of research the physical cause for this peculiar motion has remained unclear .",
    "the observations have failed to deliver independent conclusive evidence for a sufficiently large mass concentration in the direction of coma / virgo . in a recent paper",
    "the question was raised , whether the universe might exhibit an intrinsic anisotropy at large scales @xcite .",
    "not only the cmbr - dipole , but also the quadrupole and the octupole coefficients of the cmbr - multipole expansion single out preferred axes , which all point in the same direction as the dipole , i.e. roughly to the virgo direction .- terms of the multipole expansion of the cbmr - powerspectrum in spherical harmonics , but also the @xmath46-terms . ] in an earlier paper the same authors found an alignment of optical and radio polarization data with respect to virgo @xcite . in @xcite a bayesian analysis was performed with the result , that the common alignment of five different axes appears very unlikely in the context of the standard cosmological model of a homogeneously expanding friedman robertson - walker universe .",
    "the authors argue , that within the standard big bang hypothesis one rather expects an isotropic distribution of the different multipole alignment axes for the post - inflationary state . as the experimental evidence rather points to the contrary the authors conclude , that we might be living in a universe that exhibits an intrinsic anisotropic on very large scales . in a very recent paper another team of authors pointed out ,",
    "that the quadrupole and ( three ) octupole planes are correlated with 99.97 % confidence level and that the alignment of the normals of these planes with the cosmological dipole and the equinoxes is inconsistent with gaussian random skies at 99.8 % confidence level @xcite .",
    "anisotropic matter states are also predicted by string theory .",
    "the equation of state for a cosmic string or for a 2d - membrane is naturally and necessarily anisotropic",
    ". the interior matter - state of the solution discussed in this paper has a definite string interpretation : it is that of a collection of radially outlayed strings , attached to a spherical 2d - boundary membrane .",
    "the string tension falls off as @xmath47 .",
    "the strings are `` densely '' packed in the sense , that the transverse extension of the strings amounts to exactly one planck area @xcite .",
    "the absence of singularities and trapped surfaces in the holostar space - time is compatible with a very recent result in string theory . according to @xcite the so called vsi space - times - exact solutions of string theory - are incompatible with trapped surfaces .",
    "the proof is quite general .",
    "it is based on geometric arguments and does nt require the field equations .",
    "if this result is confirmed , string theory might turn out to be incompatible with trapped surfaces and - consequentially - classical space - time singularities , such as can be found in the classical black hole solutions .",
    ", as had been thought decades before , but rather in a universe which consists mostly out of ( cold ) `` dark matter '' and `` dark energy '' .",
    "although we neither know what the `` dark matter '' is , and even less what the `` dark energy '' could be , the equation of state for the large scale distribution of mass - energy in the universe has been measured fairly accurately : it is of the form @xmath48 , which is compatible with vacuum - type , string - type or domainwall - type matter . ]",
    "therefore the result reported in @xcite has two possible outcomes : either string theory is the - essentially - correct description for a physically realistic space - time in the high _ and _ the low energy limit .",
    "then trapped surfaces , the classical vacuum black hole solutions and - most likely - space - time singularities ( of `` macroscopic scale '' ) can not be part of a physically realistic description of the world we live in .",
    "we will have to search for other solutions of the classical field equations without singularities and trapped surfaces , preferentially with a strong string character .",
    "the holostar is the simplest member of such a class of solutions .",
    "the other outcome - which might be the preferred scenario by the 1000 or more researchers who invested much time and effort in the study of singularities , event horizons , apparent horizons and trapped surfaces - might be , that despite their highly undesirable properties event horizons , trapped surfaces and singularities are real .",
    "then string theory can not fulfill its main objective to provide a unified description for all forces , including gravity , on all energy scales .",
    "we will have to look for another approach .",
    "whatever the final outcome is going to be , for the present time we have to work with the theories and solutions we know .    in this paper the geometric properties of the so called holographic solution , an exact solution of the einstein field equations , are studied in somewhat greater detail .",
    "the holographic solution turns out to be a particularly simple model for a spherically symmetric , self gravitating system with a highly - in fact maximally - anisotropic , string - type pressure . despite its simplicity and its lack of adjustable parameters",
    ", the holostar appears very well suited to explain many of the phenomena encountered in various self gravitating systems , such as black holes , the universe and - possibly - even elementary particles .",
    "the paper is divided into three sections . in the following principal section some characteristic properties of the holographic solution",
    "are derived . in the next section these properties",
    "are compared to the properties of the most fundamental objects of nature that are known so far , i.e. elementary particles , black holes and the universe .",
    "the question , whether the holostar can serve as an alternative , unified model for these fundamental objects ( within the limitations of a classical description ! ) will be discussed .",
    "the paper closes with a discussion and outlook .",
    "in this section i derive some characteristic properties of the holostar solution . as the exterior space - time of the holostar",
    "is identical to the known schwarzschild vacuum solution , only the interior space - time will be covered in detail .    despite the mathematically simple form of the interior metric",
    ", the holostar s interior structure and dynamics turns out to be far from trivial .",
    "a remarkable list of properties can be deduced from the interior metric , indicating that the holostar has much in common with a spherically symmetric black hole and with the observable universe .      for any spherically symmetric problem the metric",
    "is characterized by two functions , which only depend on the radial coordinate value @xmath19 . in units @xmath49 and with the ( + - - - ) sign convention the most general spherically symmetric metric can be expressed as :    @xmath50    the holostar solution is the simplest spherically symmetric solution of the einstein field equations containing matter .",
    "it s remarkable properties arise from a delicate cancelation of terms in the einstein field equations , which only arises for a matter - distribution equal to    @xmath51    and a string type equation of state    @xmath52    the equation of state @xmath53 implies @xmath54 , which `` linearizes '' the field equations ( in a spherically symmetric problem ) and decouples the set of two non - linear differential equations for the metric coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 to a single linear first order differential equation :    @xmath57    for @xmath58 the tangential pressure is a linear function of the metric s first and second derivatives :    @xmath59    for the linearized equations a ( weighted ) superposition principle holds : any solution can be expressed as the superposition of the weighted sum of already known solutions , as long as the weights @xmath60 satisfy the norm condition @xmath61 , i.e. add up to one .",
    "the metric coefficient @xmath56 and the fields @xmath16 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 of any conceivable solution can be derived from the weighted sum of the metric coefficients @xmath64 and fields @xmath65 etc .",
    "of the already known solutions .",
    "see @xcite for a somewhat more detailed discussion and derivation .",
    "independent from the simplifications arising from an equation of state of the form @xmath53 , the `` special '' matter - distribution @xmath66 renders the generally non - homogeneous differential equation for the _ radial _ metric coefficient @xmath55 to a _ homogeneous _ differential equation . for any spherically symmetric problem",
    "the radial metric coefficient @xmath55 can be derived exclusively from the ( total ) matter - density @xmath16 by a simple integration :    @xmath67    it is important to keep in mind that equation ( [ eq : r / a ] ) is completely general and does not depend on the equation of state .",
    "the only requirement is spherical symmetry and the einstein field equations with zero cosmological constant .",
    "therefore in any spherically symmetric problem the spatial part of the metric @xmath68 is independent of the pressure .",
    "it is easy to see from equation ( [ eq : r / a ] ) that a matter - density of the form @xmath66 is special . for this matter - density the spatial part of the metric attains its simplest possible form : @xmath69 .    with the additional assumption , that the holostar resides in an exterior vacuum space - time",
    "one arrives at the following form for the matter - distribution    @xmath70    @xmath71 denotes the heavyside step functional and @xmath72 the dirac delta - distribution .    with the additional simplification due to the ( string ) equation of state @xmath53",
    "we get :    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75 is the position of the holostar s boundary membrane , which separates the interior matter distribution from the exterior vacuum space - time .",
    "@xmath76 is the gravitational radius of the holostar , @xmath77 its gravitating mass and @xmath12 is a fundamental length .",
    "there is some significant theoretical evidence @xcite that @xmath12 is comparable to the planck - length up to a numerical factor of order unity ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "an experimental determination of the fundamental area @xmath79 is given in section [ sec : r0 ] of this paper .",
    "the experimental result @xmath80 agrees quite well with the theoretical expectation . )",
    "used throughout this paper , planck - units for the fundamental physical quantities such as the planck time @xmath81 , the planck mass @xmath82 , etc .",
    "are given as powers of @xmath83 .",
    "for instance @xmath84 , @xmath85,@xmath86 , @xmath87 , etc .",
    "for the temperature units k=1 are used throughout this paper .",
    "the choice @xmath88 implies that temperature and energy are regarded as equivalent ( or dual ) quantities , so that the planck temperature @xmath89 .",
    "another natural choice for @xmath90 would be to set @xmath91 , which has the effect that some factors of @xmath92 are eliminated in the equations . ]    at the holostar s center a negative point mass @xmath93 of roughly planck mass is situated .",
    "has an exterior metric which is exactly minkowski , i.e. @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "this means , that the total gravitational mass of such a ( minimal ) holostar is zero .",
    "yet there is a non - zero matter - distribution in the interior region @xmath96 .",
    "the integral over the matter - distribution of the interior region @xmath97 formally gives a mass of @xmath98 . in order to get a mass of zero for the total space - time",
    "one has to introduce a negative point - mass @xmath93 at the origin . in @xcite",
    "it was shown , that @xmath99 , so @xmath100 . ] from a purely classical point of view the holostar space - time therefore contains a `` naked '' singularity , which - however - is `` covered up '' by the surrounding matter .",
    "the question is , whether this ( formal ) negative point mass is observable . in a spherically symmetric context",
    "the only relevant observable for a spherically symmetric object is its gravitating mass , which can be calculated from the ( improper ) integral over the mass - energy density . for the holographic solution the mass `` visible '' for an observer situated at radial position @xmath19",
    "is given by    @xmath101    @xmath102 is zero at @xmath103 and negative only for @xmath104 .",
    "we find that the observable effect of the negative mass singularity is `` shielded '' from the outside world by the surrounding matter such , that the presence of a negative mass is `` noticeable '' only within the planck - sized region @xmath104 .",
    "but for distances smaller than the planck distance , we expect the classical description to break down .",
    "in fact , according to recent results in loop quantum gravity , measuring the geometry with sub - planck precision makes no sense , as the geometric operators are quantized . with this in mind",
    "the negative point mass singularity at the center rather appears as an artifact of the purely classical description : for @xmath105 , i.e. for an energy / distance range where classical general relativity can be expected to be a fairly good approximation , the quantum singularity at @xmath104 has no noticeable adverse effects for any classical observer .      the proper radius ,",
    "i.e. the proper length of a radial trajectory from the center to radial coordinate position @xmath19 , of the holostar scales with @xmath106 :    @xmath107    the proper radial distance between the membrane at @xmath108 and the gravitational radius at @xmath109 is given by :    @xmath110    the proper volume of the region enclosed by a sphere with proper area @xmath111 scales with @xmath112 :    @xmath113    @xmath114 is the volume of the respective sphere in flat space .",
    "therefore both volume and radial distance in the interior space - time region of the holostar are enhanced over the respective volume or radius of a sphere in flat space by the square - root of the ratio between @xmath75 and the fundamental distance defined by @xmath12 .",
    "the proper integral over the mass - density , i.e. the sum over the total constituent matter , scales as the proper radius , i.e. as @xmath115 .",
    "the enormous shrinkage of radial ruler distances due to the radial metric coefficient @xmath116 implies , that the matter - density in any extended volume is nearly homogeneous .",
    "a stationary observer at radial position @xmath19 will find , that a concentric sphere with proper radius @xmath117 will have negligible extension in terms of the radial coordinate parameter @xmath19 ( keep in mind , that @xmath19 _ not _ a proper distance measure ! ) : with @xmath118 we find that @xmath119 .",
    "the matter - density within any sphere of _ proper _ radius @xmath120 will differ at most by :    @xmath121    for @xmath117 the maximum relative difference in density will be given by @xmath122 .",
    "as @xmath12 is comparable to the planck length , the matter - density in the holostar space - time can be regarded as nearly homogeneous for any stationary observer further than a million planck - distances from the center .",
    "we will see later in section [ sec : massive : acc ] that the situation is even more favorable for a _ geodesically _ moving observer .",
    "for such an observer the local hubble distance @xmath123 is equal in magnitude to the radial coordinate value , i.e. @xmath124 . far away from its turning point of the motion",
    "such an observer moves highly relativistically on a nearly radial trajectory with a @xmath10-factor proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "due to lorentz - contraction in the radial direction a geodesically moving observer will find that the large scale matter - distribution is homogeneous with a relative deviation from homogeneity that is unmeasurable by all practical purposes : @xmath126 within the local hubble volume of such an observer .",
    "for example , at radial position @xmath127 , corresponding to the current radius of the universe , the density within the a sphere of proper radius @xmath128 varies at most by @xmath22 .",
    "keep in mind that in practice the matter - distribution will show much larger fluctuations due to the magnification of quantum fluctuations during the expansion and by the various processes of structure formation .      for a space - time with a diagonal stress - energy tensor , @xmath129 , the energy conditions can be stated in the following form :    * weak energy condition : @xmath130 and @xmath131 * strong energy condition : @xmath132 and @xmath131 * dominant energy condition : @xmath133    it is easy to see that the holostar fulfills the weak and strong energy conditions at all space - time points , except at @xmath134 , where - formally - a negative point mass of roughly planck - size is situated . the dominant energy condition is fulfilled everywhere except at @xmath134 and at the position of the membrane @xmath135 .    according to the recent results of loop quantum gravity , the notion of space - time points is ill defined .",
    "space - time looses its smooth manifold structure at small distances . at its fundamental level",
    "the geometry of space time should be regarded as discrete @xcite .",
    "the minimum ( quantized ) area in loop quantum gravity is non - zero and roughly equal to the planck area @xcite",
    ". therefore the smallest physically meaningful space - time region will be bounded by a surface of roughly planck - area .",
    "measurements probing the interior of a minimal space - time region make no sense .",
    "a minimal space - time region should be regarded as devoid of any physical ( sub-)structure .",
    "a similar result follows from string theory .",
    "although string theory treats space - time as a smooth manifold structure up to the highest energies and smallest scales , all observables , such as the frequency of a vibrating string , are quantized in terms of the string scale .",
    "probing the high - trans - planckian - energy regime , i.e. at distances far smaller than the string scale , just leads to the dual description of an equivalent string theory at low energies .",
    "for instance a string state at low energies with n `` winding modes '' and m `` longitudinal modes '' can not be distinguished - with respect to its total vibrational energy - from a string state at high energies , where the numbers n and m of the `` winding '' and `` longitudinal '' are interchanged .",
    "if the energy conditions are evaluated with respect to physically meaningful space - time regions , i.e. by integrals over at least planck - sized regions , the following picture emerges : due to the negative point mass at the center of the holostar the weak energy condition is violated in the sub planck size region @xmath104 .",
    "however , from the viewpoint of loop quantum gravity this region should be regarded as inaccessible for any meaningful physical measurement .",
    "i therefore propose to discard the region @xmath104 from the physical picture .",
    "this deliberate exclusion of a classically well defined region might appear somewhat conceived . from the viewpoint of loop quantum gravity",
    "it is quite natural .",
    "furthermore , disregarding the region @xmath104 is not inconsistent .",
    "in fact , the holographic solution in itself very strongly suggests , that whatever is `` located '' in the region @xmath136 is irrelevant to the ( classical ) physics outside of this region , not only from a quantum , but also from a purely classical perspective : if we `` cut out '' the region @xmath137 from the holostar space - time and identify all space - time points on the sphere @xmath138 , we arrive at exactly the same space - time in the physically relevant region @xmath139 , as if the region @xmath104 had been included .",
    "the reason for this is , that the gravitational mass of the region @xmath140 - evaluated classically - is exactly zero .",
    "this result is due to the ( unphysical ) negative point mass at the ( unphysical ) position @xmath141 in the classical solution , which cancels the integral over the mass - density @xmath142 in the interval @xmath143 $ ] .",
    "although neither the negative point mass nor the infinite mass - density and pressure at the center of the holostar are acceptable , they do nt have any classical effect outside the physically meaningful region @xmath144 .",
    "thus the holographic solution satisfies the weak ( positive ) energy condition in any physically meaningful space - time region throughout the whole space - time manifold .",
    "the same is true for the strong energy condition .",
    "the two space - times with the region @xmath140 `` cut out '' or with @xmath145 at @xmath134 can only be distinguished from each other by measurements in the sub - planck size region @xmath136 .",
    "whether these two space - times are different therefore appears rather as a philosophical question with no practical consequence . only if our measurement capabilities increase dramatically , so that planck - precision measurements become possible",
    ", one might be able to answer this question .",
    "however , if the results of loop quantum gravity ( quantization of the geometric operators ) or of string theory ( dualities ) are essentially correct , chances are , that it will be impossible in principle to distinguish both space - times .",
    "can one `` mend '' the violation of the dominant energy condition in the membrane by a similar argument ?",
    "due to the considerable surface pressure of the membrane the dominant energy condition is clearly not satisfied within the membrane",
    ". unfortunately there is no way to fulfill the dominant energy condition by `` smoothing '' over a planck - size region , as is possible in case of the weak and strong energy conditions .",
    "therefore the violation of the dominant energy condition by the membrane must be considered as a real physical effect , i.e. a genuine property of the holostar space - time .",
    "is the violation of the dominant energy condition within the membrane incompatible with the most basic physical laws ?",
    "the dominant energy condition can be interpreted as saying , that the speed of energy flow of matter is always less than the speed of light . as the dominant energy condition is violated in the membrane",
    ", one must expect some `` non - local '' behavior of the membrane .",
    "non - locality , however , is a well known property of quantum phenomena . non - local behavior of quantum systems has been verified experimentally up to macroscopic dimensions .",
    "this suggests that the membrane might be a macroscopic quantum phenomenon . in @xcite",
    "it is proposed , that the membrane should consist of a condensed boson gas at a temperature far below the bose - temperature of the membrane .",
    "in such a case the membrane could be characterized as a single macroscopic quantum state of bosons .",
    "one would expect collective non - local behavior from such a state .",
    "one of the outstanding characteristics of the holographic solution is the property , that the `` stress - energy content '' of the membrane is equal to the gravitating mass @xmath77 of the holostar .    for any spherically symmetric solution to the equations of general relativity the total gravitational mass @xmath102 within a concentric space - time region bounded by @xmath19",
    "is given by the following mass function :    @xmath146    @xmath102 is the integral of the mass - density @xmath16 over the ( improper ) volume element @xmath147 , i.e. over a spherical shell with radial coordinate extension @xmath148 situated at radial coordinate value @xmath19 .",
    "note , that in a space - time with @xmath149 the so called `` improper '' integral over the interior mass - density appears just the right way to evaluate the asymptotic gravitational mass @xmath77 : the gravitational mass can be thought to be the genuine sum ( i.e. the proper integral ) over the constituent matter , corrected by the gravitational red - shift .",
    "the proper volume element is given by @xmath150 .",
    "the red - shift factor for an asymptotic observer situated at infinity , with @xmath151 , is given by @xmath152 .",
    "therefore the proper integral over the constituent matter , red - shift corrected with respect to an observer at spatial infinity , is given by : @xmath153 .",
    "this is equal to the improper integral in equation ( [ eq : massfunction ] ) , whenever @xmath149 .",
    "if the energy - content of the membrane is calculated by the same procedure , replacing @xmath16 with the two principal non - zero pressure components @xmath154 in the membrane , one gets :    @xmath155    the holostar s membrane is nothing else than its - real , physically localizable - boundary .",
    "the single main characteristic of the holostar solution with respect to the exterior space - time , its gravitating mass @xmath77 , can be derived exclusively from the properties of its boundary - a result which is quite compatible with the holographic principle .",
    "note also , that the tangential pressure of the holostar s membrane , @xmath156 , is ( almost ) exactly equal to the tangential pressure attributed to the event horizon of a spherically symmetric black hole by the membrane paradigm @xcite , @xmath157 .",
    "according to the membrane paradigm all properties of an ( uncharged , non - rotating ) black hole - with respect to the _ exterior _ space - time - can explained in terms of a - fictitious - membrane with @xmath158 and @xmath159 . for charged / rotating black holes a similar result holds .",
    "the equivalence of the - fictitious - black hole membrane with the - real - holostar membrane therefore guarantees , that the holostar s dynamical action on the exterior space - time is practically indistinguishable from that of a black hole with the same gravitating mass .",
    "the integral over the mass - density ( or over some particular pressure components ) might not be considered as a very satisfactory means to determine the total gravitational mass of a self gravitating system . neither the mass - density nor the principal pressures have a coordinate independent meaning : they transform like the components of a tensor , not as scalars .    in this respect",
    "it is quite remarkable , that the gravitating mass of the holostar can be derived from the integral over the _ trace _ of the stress - energy tensor @xmath160 .",
    "in fact , the integral over @xmath161 is exactly equal to @xmath77 if the negative point mass @xmath93 at the center is included , or - which is the preferred procedure - if the integration is performed from @xmath162 $ ] , as was suggested in the previous section .",
    "@xmath163    with    @xmath164    contrary to the mass - density or the pressure , @xmath161 is a lorentz - scalar and therefore has a definite coordinate - independent meaning at any space - time point .",
    "note , that the scalar @xmath165 gives quite an accurate account for the `` strength '' of the local source - distribution at @xmath166 , which creates the gravitational field of the holostar .",
    "the gravitating mass of the holostar can also be derived from the so called tolman - mass @xmath167 of the space - time :    @xmath168    the tolman mass is often referred to as the `` active gravitational mass '' of a self - gravitating system .",
    "the motion of particles in a wide class of exact solutions to the equations of general relativity indicate that the sum of the matter density and the three principle pressures can be interpreted as the `` true source '' of the gravitational field .",
    "is given by @xmath169 in local minkowski - coordinates .",
    "therefore the sum of @xmath16 and the three principal pressures appears as source - term in poisson s equation for the local gravitational acceleration @xmath170 , i.e. can be considered as the `` true '' gravitational mass density . ]",
    "the holostar space - time therefore has three identical measures for it s total gravitating mass @xmath77 , the `` normal '' mass @xmath171 , derived by an integral over the energy - density @xmath16 , the `` invariant '' mass @xmath172 , derived by an integral over the ( coordinate independent ) trace @xmath161 of the stress - energy tensor , and the `` tolman '' mass @xmath167 , derived by an integral over the active gravitational mass - density @xmath173 .",
    "also note , that the rr- and tt - components of the ricci - tensor are zero everywhere , except for a @xmath174-functional at the position of the membrane :    @xmath175      in this section the equations for the geodesic motion of particles within the holostar are set up .",
    "keep in mind that the results of the analysis of pure geodesic motion have to be interpreted with caution , as pure geodesic motion is unrealistic in the interior of a holostar .",
    "in general it is not possible to neglect the pressure - forces totally .",
    "in fact , as will be shown later , it is quite improbable that the motion of massive particles will be geodesic throughout the holostar s _ whole _ interior space - time .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of pure geodesic motion , especially for photons , is a valuable tool to discover the properties of any space - time .",
    "disregarding pressure effects , the interior motion of massive particles or photons can be described by an effective potential .",
    "the geodesic equations of motion for a general spherically symmetric space - time , expressed in terms of the `` geometric '' constants of the motion @xmath176 and @xmath177 , were given in the appendix of @xcite :    @xmath178    @xmath179    @xmath180    @xmath176 is the interior turning point of the motion , @xmath181 is the radial velocity , expressed as fraction to the local velocity of light in the radial direction , @xmath182 is the tangential velocity , expressed as fraction to the local velocity of light in the tangential direction . @xmath183 and @xmath184 are orthogonal for a stationary observer in the coordinate frame , so @xmath185 .",
    "the quantities @xmath186 and @xmath187 all lie in the interval @xmath188 $ ] .",
    "one would think , that the turning point @xmath176 of the motion of a particle in any spherically symmetric space - time can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "we will see later , that this is not the case in the holostar space - time .",
    "self - consistency requires , that @xmath189 .",
    "however , in the following discussion we will assume that @xmath176 can - in principle - take on any value @xmath190 .",
    "@xmath191 is the velocity of the particle at the turning point of the motion , @xmath176 . by definition @xmath192 at any turning point of the motion , therefore @xmath177 is purely tangential at @xmath176 . for photons @xmath193 .",
    "pure radial motion for photons is only possible , when @xmath194 . in this case @xmath195 .",

    "the photons will therefore always be subject to an effective potential with @xmath196 , i.e. an effective potential that is not constant .",
    "but whenever the photon has moved an appreciable distance from its turning point of the motion , i.e. whenever @xmath197 , the effective potential is nearly zero",
    ". therefore non - radial motion of photons can be regarded as nearly `` force - free '' , whenever @xmath197 . ]    in order to integrate the geodesic equations of motion , the following relations are required :    @xmath198    @xmath199    @xmath200 is the time measured by the asymptotic observer at spatial infinity .",
    "if the equations of motion are to be solved with respect to the proper time @xmath17 of the particle ( this is only reasonable for massive particles with @xmath201 ) , the following relation is useful :    @xmath202    @xmath203 is the special relativistic @xmath10-factor and @xmath204 , the local @xmath10-factor of the particle at the turning point of the motion .    within the holostar s interior @xmath205 .",
    "therefore the equations of motion reduce to the following set of simple equations :    @xmath206    @xmath207    the equation for @xmath208 can be expressed as a function of radial position @xmath19 , instead of time :    @xmath209    far away from the turning point of the motion one can approximate equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) this approximation will turn out useful later . we know from equation ( [ eq : beta : t2:int ] ) that the tangential velocity component @xmath210 along the trajectory of any geodesically moving particle becomes arbitrarily small , whereas the radial velocity component @xmath181 becomes nearly unity , when we are far away from the turning point of the motion .",

    "@xmath197 we find @xmath220 , so that the angle remains nearly unchanged .",
    "this implies , that the number of revolutions of an interior particle around the holostar s center is limited .",

    "the motion appears accelerated from the viewpoint of an exterior asymptotic observer .",
    "the perceived acceleration decreases over time , as the effective potential becomes very flat for @xmath197 .    for all possible values of @xmath176 and @xmath177 the position of the membrane is a local minimum of the effective potential . within the holostar s",

    "the effective potential has been normalized such , that at any turning point of the motion @xmath249 . a necessary ( and sufficient ) condition for bound motion then is , that the equation    @xmath250    has a real solution @xmath251 in the exterior ( schwarzschild ) space - time .      for pure radial motion and particles with non - zero rest - mass equation ( [ eq : cond : turningpoint ] ) is easy to solve .",
    "we find the following relation between the exterior and interior turning points of the motion :    @xmath252    equation ( [ eq : re:0 ] ) indicates , that for massive particles bound orbits are only possible if @xmath196 .",
    "if the massive particles have angular momentum , the turning point of the motion , @xmath176 , must be somewhat larger than @xmath12 , if the particles are to be bound .",
    "angular motion therefore increases the central `` unbound '' region . the number of massive particles in the `` unbound '' central region , however , is very small . in @xcite",
    "it will be shown , that the number of ( ultra - relativistic ) constituent particles within a concentric interior region of the holostar in thermal equilibrium is proportional to the boundary surface of the region with @xmath253 .",
    "let us assume that a massive particle has an interior turning point of the motion far away from the central region , i.e. @xmath254 . equation ( [ eq : re:0 ] ) then implies , that for such a particle the exterior turning point of the motion will lie only a few planck - distances outside the membrane .",
    "this can be seen as follows :    if a massive particle is to venture an appreciable distance away from the membrane , the factor @xmath255 on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : re:0 ] ) must deviate appreciably from unity .",
    "this is only possible if @xmath256 . in the case",
    "@xmath257 equation ( [ eq : re:0 ] ) gives a value for the exterior turning point of the motion , @xmath212 , that is very close to the gravitational radius of the holostar .",

    "even particles whose turning point of the motion is as close as two fundamental length units from the center of the holostar , i.e. @xmath259 , have an exterior turning point of the motion situated just one gravitational radius outside of the membrane at @xmath260 .    the above analysis demonstrates , that only very few , if any , massive particles can escape the holostar s gravitational field on a classical geodesic trajectory . as has been remarked before , an escape to infinity is only possible for massive particles ( with zero angular momentum ) emanating from a sub planck - size region of the center ( @xmath261 ) .",
    "it is quite unlikely that this region will contain more than one particle .    in the case of angular motion",
    "the picture becomes more complicated .",
    "in general the equation @xmath262 is a cubic equation in @xmath212 :    @xmath263    it is possible to solve this equation by elementary methods . the formula are quite complicated .",
    "the general picture is the following : for any given @xmath176 the particle becomes `` less bound becomes larger than the value given in equation ( [ eq : re:0 ] ) ] '' , the higher the value of @xmath231 at the interior turning point gets .",
    "particles with interior turning point of the motion close to the center are `` less bound '' than particles with interior turning point close to the boundary . for sufficiently small @xmath176",
    "bound motion is not possible , whenever a certain value of @xmath231 is exceeded .    for particles with @xmath264 equation ( [ eq : re ] )",

    "we find    @xmath266    which allows us to determine @xmath212 to a fairly good approximation :    @xmath267    the motion is bound , as long as @xmath268 .",
    "this inequality seems to indicate , that any massive particle is able to escape the holostar in principle , as long as @xmath269 is high enough .",
    "this however , is not true :    the geodesic motion of massive particles and photons is described by an effective potential , which is a function of @xmath176 and @xmath177 . from equation ( [ eq : veff : beta ] )",
    "it can be seen , that the exterior effective potential for fixed @xmath176 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath231 , i.e. @xmath270 .",
    "this is true for any radial position @xmath19",
    ". therefore the exterior effective potential of any particle with fixed @xmath176 and arbitrary @xmath177 is bounded from below by the effective potential of a photon .",
    "this implies that whenever a photon possesses an exterior turning point of the motion , any particle with @xmath271 must have an exterior turning point as well , somewhat closer to the holostar s membrane .",
    "therefore escape to infinity from any interior position @xmath176 for an arbitrary rest - mass particle is only possible , if a photon can escape to infinity from @xmath176 .    in the following section the conditions for the unbound motion of photons are analyzed .",
    "the effective potential for photons at spatial infinity is zero .",
    "therefore in principal any photon has the chance to escape the holostar permanently .",
    "usually this does nt happen , due to the photon s angular momentum .    disregarding the quantum - mechanical tunnel - effect ,",
    "the fate of a photon , i.e. whether it remains bound in the gravitational field of the holostar or whether it escapes permanently on a classical trajectory to infinity , is determined at the angular momentum barrier , which is situated in the exterior space - time at @xmath272 .",
    "the exterior effective potential for photons possesses a local maximum at this position .",
    "if the effective potential for a photon at @xmath273 is less than 1 , i.e. @xmath274 , the photon has a non - zero radial velocity at the maximum of the angular momentum barrier .",
    "escape is classically inevitable .",
    "the condition for ( classical ) escape for photons is thus given by :    @xmath275    any photon emitted from the region defined by equation ( [ eq : veff:1 ] ) will escape , if its motion is purely geodesic .",
    "on the other hand , any photon whose internal turning point of the motion lies outside the `` photon - escape region '' defined by equation ( [ eq : veff:1 ] ) will be turned back at the angular momentum barrier and therefore is bound .",
    "likewise , all massive particles outside the photon escape region must be bound as well , because the exterior effective potential of a massive particle is always larger than that of a photon with the same @xmath176 , i.e. the angular momentum barrier for a massive particle is always higher than that of a photon emitted from the same @xmath176 .",
    "therefore every particle with interior turning point of the motion outside the `` photon escape region '' will be turned back by the angular momentum barrier .    for large holostars ,",
    "the region of classical escape for photons becomes arbitrarily small with respect to the holostar s overall size .",
    "a holostar of the size of the sun with @xmath276 has an `` unbound '' interior region of @xmath277 .",
    "the radial extension of the `` photon escape region '' is 13 orders of magnitude less than the holostar s gravitational radius .",
    "the gravitational mass of this region is negligible compared to the total gravitational mass of the holostar . )",
    ", the temperature at the radius of the photon - escape region is @xmath278 , which is quite close to the temperature of nucleosynthesis . ]      for particles with non - zero rest - mass the analysis is very much simplified , if the effect of the angular momentum barrier is neglected . with @xmath279 , the angular momentum barrier hasnt a significant effect on the question , whether a the particle is bound or unbound . ]",
    "massive particles generally have an effective potential at spatial infinity larger than zero .",
    "a necessary , but not sufficient condition for a massive particle to be unbound is , that the effective potential at spatial infinity be less than 1 .",
    "this condition translates to :    @xmath280    according to equation ( [ eq : re:1 ] ) escape on a classical geodesic trajectory for a massive particle is only possible from a region a few planck - lengths around the center , unless the particle is highly relativistic .",
    "for example , massive particles with @xmath281 can only be unbound , if they originate from the region @xmath282 .",
    "if the region of escape for massive particles is to be macroscopic , the proper tangential velocity @xmath231 at the turning point of the motion must be phenomenally close to the local speed of light .",
    "note however that in such a case there usually is an angular momentum barrier in the exterior space - time ( see the discussion in the previous section ) .",
    "the lifetime of a black hole , due to hawking evaporation , is proportional to @xmath283 .",
    "hawking radiation is independent of the interior structure of a black hole .",
    "it depends solely on the exterior metric up to the event horizon .",
    "as the exterior space - times of the holostar and a black hole are identical ( disregarding the planck - size region between gravitational radius and membrane ) the estimated lifetime of the holostar , due to loss of interior particles , should not significantly deviate from the hawking result .",
    "an upper bound for the flux of particles from the interior of the holostar to infinity can be derived by the following , albeit very crude argument :    under the - as we will later see , unrealistic - assumption , that the effects of the negative radial pressure can be neglected , the particles move on geodesics and the results derived in the previous sections can be applied .    for large holostars and ignoring the pressure the particle flux to infinity",
    "will be dominated by photons or other zero rest - mass particles , such as neutrinos , emanating from the `` photon escape region '' @xmath284 defined by equation ( [ eq : veff:1 ] ) .",
    "the gravitational mass @xmath285 of this region , viewed by an asymptotic observer at infinity , is proportional to @xmath286 .",
    "the exterior asymptotic time @xmath287 for a photon to travel from @xmath176 to the membrane at @xmath288 is given by :    @xmath289    for a large holostar with @xmath290 the integral can be approximated by :    @xmath291    note , that the time of travel from the membrane , @xmath108 , to a position @xmath19 well outside the gravitational radius of the holostar is of order @xmath292 , i.e. very much shorter than the time of travel from the center of the holostar to the membrane , which is proportional to @xmath293 .    under the assumption that the continuous particle flux to infinity is comparable to the time average of the - rather conceived - process , in which the whole `` photon escape region '' is moved in one bunch from the center of the holostar to its surface ,",
    "one finds the following estimate for the mass - energy - flux to infinity for a large holostar :    @xmath294    this flux is larger than the flux of hawking radiation , for which the following relation holds :    @xmath295    however , the pressure effect has not been taken into account in equation ( [ eq : flux:1 ] ) . as will be shown in the following sections , the pressure reduces the photon flux two - fold : first it reduces the local energy of the outward moving photons , so that less energy is transported to infinity .",
    "second , if the local energy of the individual photons is reduced with respect to pure geodesic motion , the chances of classical escape for a photon are dramatically reduced , because most photons will not have enough `` energy '' to escape when they finally reach the pressure - free region beyond the membrane .",
    "the first effect reduces the energy of the photon flux by a factor @xmath296 , as can be derived from the results of the following section .",
    "this tightens the bound given in equation ( [ eq : flux:1 ] ) to @xmath297 .",
    "the second effect will effectively switch off the flux of photons . as will be shown later , the energy of an ensemble of photons moving radially outward or inward changes in such a way , that the ensemble s local energy density is always proportional to the local energy density of the interior matter it encounters along its way .",
    "therefore an ensemble of photons `` coming from the interior '' , having reached the radial position @xmath108 of the membrane , will be indistinguishable from the photons present at the membrane .",
    "the majority of the photons at the membrane , however , will have a turning point of the motion close to @xmath108 , meaning that escape on a classical trajectory is impossible .",
    "therefore , whenever photons coming from the interior have reached the surface of the holostar , @xmath108 , their energy will be so low , that the vast majority of the photons are bound and will become trapped in the membrane .",
    "classically it appears as if no photon will be able to escape from the holostar .",
    "massive particles which have high velocities at their interior turning points of the motion behave like photons .",
    "therefore the discussion of the previous paragraph applies to those particles as well .",
    "highly relativistic massive particles will not be able to carry a significant amount of mass - energy to infinity . for massive particles escape to infinity is only possible , if the motion starts out from a region within one ( or two ) fundamental lengths of the center ( see equation ( [ eq : re:1 ] ) ) .",
    "but this region contains only very few particles , if any at all .",
    "furthermore one has to ensure , that the motion of the massive particles does not become highly relativistically later on .",
    "in such a case the massive particles would behave similar to photons and would be subject to the same energy - loss as experienced by the photons .",
    "the holostar therefore must be regarded as classically stable , just as a black hole . once in a while",
    ", however , a particle undergoing random thermal motion close to the surface might acquire sufficient energy in order to escape or tunnel through the angular momentum barrier .",
    "furthermore there are the tidal forces in the exterior space - time , giving rise to `` normal '' hawking evaporation .    taking the pressure - effects into account",
    ", the mass - energy flux to infinity of the holographic solution will be quite comparable to the mass - energy flux due to hawking - evaporation of a black hole .",
    "the exponent @xmath298 in the energy - flux equation @xmath299 will lie somewhere between @xmath300 and @xmath233 , presumably quite close , if not equal to @xmath233 .",
    "even the very crude upper bound of equation ( [ eq : flux:1 ] ) yields quite long life - times . for a holostar with the mass of the sun ,",
    "the evaporation time due to equation ( [ eq : flux:1 ] ) is still much larger than the age of the universe ( @xmath301 ) .",
    "in this section the effect of the pressure on the internal motion of ultra - relativistic particles within the holostar is studied .",
    "i will demonstrate that the negative , purely radial pressure , equal in magnitude to the mass - density , is an essential property of the holostar , if it is to be a self - consistent static solution .",
    "let us consider the radial movement ( outward or inward ) of a spherical shell of particles with a proper thickness @xmath302 , situated at radial coordinate position @xmath19 within the holostar .",
    "the shell has a proper volume of @xmath303 and a total local energy content of @xmath304 .    in this section",
    "the analysis will be restricted to zero rest - mass particles , referred to as photons in the following discussion . in the geometric optics",
    "approximation photons move along null - geodesic trajectories .",
    "note that the pressure will have an effect on the local energy of the photon .",
    "however , as the local speed of light is independent of the photon s energy , the pressure will not be able to change the geometry of a photon trajectory , i.e. the values of @xmath305 as determined from the equations for a null - geodesic trajectory .    for pure radial motion of photons there can be no cross - overs , i.e. no particle can leave the region defined by the two concentric boundary surfaces of the shell .",
    "the equation of motion for a null - geodesic in the interior of the holostar is given by :    @xmath306    for @xmath197 the square - root factor is nearly one .",
    "therefore whenever the photon has reached a radial position @xmath307 , a negligible error is made by setting @xmath194 , which corresponds to pure radial motion .",
    "equation ( [ eq : motion : photon ] ) with @xmath308 has the solution :    @xmath309    the radial distance between two photons , one travelling on the inner boundary of the shell , starting out at @xmath310 , one travelling on its outer boundary , starting out from @xmath311 , is given by :    @xmath312    if @xmath313 , taylor - expansion of the square - root yields :    @xmath314    in terms of the proper thickness @xmath315 of the shell we find the following relation :    @xmath316    therefore , if the shell moves radially outward with the local speed of light , its proper thickness changes according to an inverse square root law .      whenever the proper radial thickness changes during the movement of the shell , work will be done against the negative radial pressure .",
    "the rate of change in proper thickness @xmath317 per radial coordinate displacement @xmath148 of the shell is given by :    @xmath318    due to the anisotropic pressure ( the two tangential pressure components are zero ) any change in volume along the tangential direction will have no effect on the total energy .",
    "the purely radial pressure has only an effect on the energy of the shell , if the shell expands or contracts in the radial direction .",
    "the work done by the negative radial pressure therefore is given by :    @xmath319    because the radial pressure is negative , the total energy of the shell is reduced when the shell is compressed along the radial direction .",
    "the total pressure - induced local energy change of the shell , when it is moved outward from radial coordinate position @xmath176 to another position @xmath197 is given by the following integral :    @xmath320    but @xmath321 with @xmath322 and @xmath323 is nothing else than the original total local energy of the shell , @xmath324 .",
    "therefore we find the following expression for the final energy of the shell :    @xmath325    this result could also have been obtained by assuming the ideal gas law @xmath326 with @xmath327 .",
    "the total energy density in the shell therefore changes according to the following expression :    @xmath328    we have recovered the inverse square law for the mass - density .",
    "the holographic solution has a remarkable self - consistency .",
    "any spherical shell carrying a fraction of the total local energy , moving inward or outward with the local velocity of light , changes its energy due to the negative radial pressure in such a way , that the local energy density of the shell at any radial position @xmath19 always remains exactly proportional to the actual local energy density @xmath329 of the ( static ) holographic solution . ) , i.e. @xmath330 . ]",
    "this feature is essential , if the holographic solution is to be a self consistent ( quasi- ) static solution .",
    "a holostar evidently contains matter .",
    "a fraction of this matter will consist of non - zero rest - mass particles .",
    "these particles will undergo random thermal motion .",
    "furthermore , due to hawking evaporation or accretion processes there might be a small outward or inward directed net - flux of mass - energy between the interior central core region and the boundary .",
    "even if there is no net mass - energy flux , the different particle species might have non - zero fluxes , as long as all individual fluxes add up to zero .",
    "if the internal motion ( thermal or directed ) takes place in such a way , that the local mass - density of the holostar ( @xmath21 ) is significantly changed from the inverse square law in a time scale shorter than the hawking evaporation time - scale , the holostar can not be considered ( quasi- ) static .",
    "movement of an interior particle at the speed of light from @xmath331 to the membrane at @xmath332 takes an exterior time @xmath333 .",
    "the movement of a particle from @xmath334 to the membrane is not much quicker : @xmath335 . in any case",
    "the time to move through the holostar s interior is much less than the hawking evaporation time - scale , which scales as @xmath283 .",
    "therefore a necessary condition for the holostar to be a self - consistent , quasi - static solution is , that the radial movement of a shell of zero rest mass particles should not disrupt the local ( static ) mass - density .",
    "more generally any local mass - energy fluxes should take place in such a way , that the overall structure of the holostar is not destroyed and that local mass - energy fluxes are nt magnified to an unacceptable level at large scales",
    ".      the reader might not be satisfied with the assumption , that the photons of a radially out- or in - moving shell should be subject to the holostar - pressure .",
    "the anisotropic holostar - pressure is very different from the isotropic pressure of an ultra - relativistic gas .",
    "although anisotropic pressures might become important at high densities and temperatures , we should nt necessarily expect this to be the case at the low end of the energy scale .",
    "furthermore , at low energy - densities and temperatures the mass - energy density within any spherical thin shell of the holostar will consist only out of a very small fraction of massless or extremely light ultra - relativistic particles , such as photons or neutrinos",
    ". a much higher fraction of particles will reside in the massive particle species , such as baryons . at low temperatures",
    "one would rather think , that the partial pressure of the baryons is negligible , so that the massless particles only expand / contract against their own radiation pressure . under these circumstances",
    "it is far from clear , whether the geodesic movement of radiation , expanding ( or contracting ) against its own radiation pressure , will preserve the inverse - square law for the energy density .",
    "the remarkable - non - trivial - answer to this question is yes , as will be shown in the following lines .",
    "let us assume , that only a fraction of the total energy content of a radially outmoving shell consists out of massless particles , i.e.    @xmath336    the partial pressure of the massless particles in the shell is then given by the equation of state for an ultra - relativistic gas :    @xmath337    we have already seen , that a shell of massless particles contracts in the radial direction by an inverse square - root law .",
    "yet there is an expansion in the two tangential directions proportional to @xmath338 , so that the volume of a shell of radially moving massless particles changes as :    @xmath339    from this we can calculate the energy change in the shell due to the expansion of the ultra - relativistic particles against their own - isotropic - partial pressure :    @xmath340    the total energy at radial position @xmath19 is then given by :    @xmath341    where @xmath342 is the original mass - energy in the shell at radial position @xmath176 , i.e. @xmath343 .",
    "we find , that the energy of the shell changes with an inverse square - root law , exactly as derived in the section before using the anisotropic holostar - pressure .",
    "the mass - energy density is obtained , by dividing @xmath344 by @xmath345 , which gives us :    @xmath346    again we have discovered the inverse square law for the energy density .    in the geometric optics approximation",
    "the photon number in the shell remains constant , so that the individual energy of the photons must change with @xmath19 in the same way , as the total energy of the shell changes .",
    "therefore the energy of a single photon , which is proportional to its frequency , changes with an inverse square - root law .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the evolution of the energy - density of a gas of radially outmoving ultra - relativistic particles is not affected , whether we use the anisotropic holostar pressure to calculate the pressure - induced energy - change or whether we use the isotropic pressure derived from the equation of state for an ultra - relativistic gas . in both cases",
    "the energy and frequency of an ultra - relativistic particles changes with an inverse square - root law .    for massive particles",
    "the analysis of the motion is more complicated , as the pressure is expected to have a noticeable effect not only on the local energy of the particles , but also on the global space - time trajectory of the massive particles .",
    "whenever exterior forces - such as the pressure - are present , the space - time trajectory of a massive particle does nt follow a geodesic .",
    "the extent of the deviation from geodesic motion generally depends on the particle s energy .",
    "this is contrary to massless particles , for which the constancy of the speed of light guarantees , that their space - time trajectories are independent of energy ( at least for low densities ) .",
    "the self - consistency argument given in the above two sections leads to some interesting predictions .",
    "let us assume that the outmoving shell consists of essentially non - interacting zero rest - mass particles , for example photons or neutrinos ( ideal relativistic gas assumption ) .",
    "for a large holostar the mass - density in its outer regions will become arbitrarily low .",
    "therefore the ideal gas approximation should be a reasonable assumption for large holostars . under this assumption",
    "the number of particles in the shell should remain constant .",
    "this allows us to determine the number density of zero rest - mass particles within the holostar up to a constant factor :    let @xmath347 be the number of particles in the shell at the position @xmath176 . then the number density @xmath348 of particles in the shell , as it moves inward or outward , is given by the respective change of the shell s volume :    @xmath349    under the assumption that the interior matter - distribution of the holostar is ( quasi- ) static , and that the local composition of the matter at any particular @xmath19-position does nt change with time , self - consistency requires that the number density of zero rest - mass particles per proper volume should be proportional to the number density predicted by equation ( [ eq : numberdensity ] )",
    ".    the total number of zero rest - mass particles in a holostar will then by given by the proper volume integral of the number density ( [ eq : numberdensity ] ) over the whole interior volume :    @xmath350    we arrive at the remarkable result , that the total number of zero rest - mass particles within a holostar should be proportional to the area of its boundary surface , @xmath351 . the same result holds for any concentric sphere within the holostar s interior .",
    "this is an - albeit still very tentative - indication , that the holographic principle is valid in classical general relativity , at least for large compact self gravitating objects .    under the assumption that the region @xmath352 can contain at most one particle ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , we find :    @xmath353    @xmath354 is the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "the entropy per particle @xmath6 is roughly equal to @xmath355 .",
    "this quite close to the entropy per particle of an ultra - relativistic gas , which - in the case of zero chemical potential - amounts to roughly 4.2 for fermions and 3.6 for bosons .",
    "the holostar solution is not only compatible with the holographic principle , it is the most radical fulfilment of this principle : the number of degrees of freedom of the holostar scales with its boundary area .",
    "but the fundamental degrees of freedom are not localized exclusively at the boundary : the degrees of freedom of the system can be identified with the holostar s well defined interior matter - state .",
    "even more so , every relativistic particle in the holostar s interior has a well defined entropy comparable to the entropy per particle according to an ideal gas law .",
    "the sum of the entropies of the individual particles is equal to the hawking entropy of a same sized black hole ( up to a factor of order unity ) under the following assumptions :    * the holostar s entropy is dominated by zero rest - mass particles * the region @xmath356 contains one particle * the entropy per particle is comparable to the entropy per particles of a relativistic ideal gas    we will see later , that ultra - relativistic ( zero rest mass ) particles are the dominant particle species ( by numbers ) in the holostar s interior space - time .",
    "however , the assumption that the holostar s entropy is dominated by the ultra - relativistic particles is only correct in the radiation dominated central region of the interior space - time . for large @xmath19",
    "the interior becomes matter - dominated . in the matter",
    "dominated era the entropy is dominated by the massive species .    from equation ( [ eq : n : photon ] ) one can estimate the number - density @xmath357 of the zero rest mass particles at high temperatures .",
    "we find :    @xmath358      under the assumption that the mass - energy density of the holostar is dominated by ultra - relativistic particles , the mean energy per ultra - relativistic particle can be determined from the energy density @xmath21 and the number - density given in equation ( [ eq : n : photon ] ) .",
    "@xmath359    the relation @xmath360 could have been obtained directly from the pressure - induced energy - change of a geodesically moving shell of zero - rest mass particles : as the number of particles in the shell remains constant , but the shell s total energy changes according to @xmath361 , the mean energy per particle must change in the same way as the total energy of the shell varies .    in a gas of relativistic particles in thermal equilibrium",
    "the mean energy per relativistic particle is proportional to the local temperature in appropriate units .",
    "this hints at a local radiation temperature within the holostar proportional to @xmath362 .",
    "this argument in itself is not yet too convincing .",
    "it - so far - only applies to the low - density regime in the outer regions of a holostar , where the motion is nearly geodesic and thus interaction free .",
    "it is questionable , if a temperature in the thermodynamic sense can be defined under such circumstances .",
    "however , there is another argument for a well defined local radiation temperature with @xmath363 : at the high pressures and densities within the central region of the holostar all of the known particles of the standard model of particle physics will be ultra - relativistic and their mutual interactions are strong enough to maintain a thermal spectrum .",
    "the energy - density of radiation in thermal equilibrium is proportional to @xmath364 . the energy density @xmath16 of the holostar is known to be proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "radiation will be the dominant contribution to the mass - energy at high temperature , so this argument also hints at a local temperature within the holostar s central region proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that the holostar has a well defined internal local temperature of its zero - rest mass constituent particles _ everywhere _ ,",
    "i.e. not only in the hot central region , and that this temperature follows an inverse square - root law in @xmath19 .",
    "this temperature is locally isotropic .",
    "this statement should be self - evident for the high temperature central region of the holostar , where the radiation has a very short path - length and the interaction time - scale is short .",
    "but one also finds a locally isotropic temperature in the outer regions of a holostar , where the radiation moves essentially unscattered . because of spherical symmetry , only radiation arriving with a radial component of the motion at the detector need be considered .",
    "imagine a photon emitted from the hot inner region of the holostar with an energy equal to the local temperature at the place of emission , @xmath212 . due to the square - root dependence of the temperature , the local temperature at the place of emission @xmath212 will be higher than the local temperature at the place of the detector @xmath365 by the square - root of the ratio @xmath366 .",
    "however , on its way to the detector the photon will be red - shifted due to the pressure - effect by exactly the same ( or rather inverse ) square - root factor , so that its energy , when it finally arrives at the detector , turns out to be equal to the local temperature at the detector .",
    "the same argument applies to a photon emitted from the low - temperature outer region of the holostar . due to the pressure effect",
    "this photon will be blue - shifted when it travels towards the detector .",
    "generally one finds , that the pressure induced red - shift ( or blue - shift ) exactly compensates the difference of the local temperatures between the place of emission @xmath212 and the place of absorption @xmath365 of a zero rest mass particle .    disregarding pressure effects",
    ", one could naively assume that an individual photon emitted from an interior position @xmath176 would undergo gravitational _ blue _ shift , as it moves `` down '' in the monotonically decreasing effective potential towards larger values of @xmath19 .",
    "if this were true , a photon moving from a `` hot '' inner position to a `` cold '' outer position would become even hotter .",
    "this result is paradoxical .",
    "in fact , the apparent energy change due to the naive application of the gravitational redshift - formula is exactly opposite to the pressure - induced effect :    @xmath367    the naive application of the gravitational doppler - shift formula to the interior space - time of the holostar leads to grave inconsistencies . in the holostar s interior the gravitational doppler - shift formula is not applicable .",
    "this has to do with the fact , that its derivation not only requires a stationary space - time , but also relies on the geodesic equations of motion , which are only the `` true '' equations of motion in the absence of exterior forces , i.e. in vacuum ! although particles move on geodesics in the ( rather unrealistic ) case of a pressure - free `` dust - universe '' , this is not true when significant pressures are present . therefore one can not expect the gravitational doppler - shift law to be applicable in space - time regions where the pressure is significant . the pressure not only affects the massive particles , but also the photons , as the presence of matter affects the group- and phase - velocities of the photons , which will deviate from the speed of light in vacuum ( although only marginally for the low densities encountered in the present universe ) .",
    "this fact is well known in cosmology , where the cosmological red - shift of the cmbr - photons is derived from the energy loss due to the geodesic expansion of the cmbr - photons against their own radiation pressure .",
    "note finally , that the frequency shift due to the interior pressure applies to all zero rest - mass particles .",
    "furthermore , the pressure - induced frequency shift is insensitive to the route travelled by the zero rest - mass particles .",
    "it solely depends on how the volume available to an individual particle has changed , i.e. only depends on the number - density of the particles which is a pure function of radial position .",
    "if @xmath365 is the radial position where a photon emitted from @xmath212 with frequency @xmath368 is finally absorbed , one finds .",
    "@xmath369      it is now an easy exercise to show , that any geodesically moving shell of zero rest mass particles preserves the planck - distribution :    the planck - distribution is defined as :    @xmath370    @xmath371 is the density of the photons , @xmath372 their individual frequency and @xmath161 the temperature .",
    "the left side of the equation , i.e. the number density of the photons with a given frequency , scales as @xmath373 according to equation ( [ eq : numberdensity ] ) .",
    "the right side of the equation has the same dependence .",
    "the frequency @xmath372 of any individual photon scales with @xmath374 according to equation ( [ eq : redshift1 ] ) .",
    "the same shift applies to the frequency interval @xmath375 .",
    "therefore the factor @xmath376 on the right side of the equation also scales as @xmath373 .",
    "the argument of the exponential function , @xmath377 is constant , because both the frequency of an individual photon @xmath378 , as well as the overall temperature @xmath379 have the same @xmath19-dependence .",
    "we find that the planck - distribution is preserved by the geodesic motion of a non - interacting gas of radiation within the holostar .",
    "this astonishing result directly follows from the holographic metric and the effects of the negative radial pressure .",
    "the local inverse square - root temperature law for the holostar s interior space - time allows us to derive the hawking temperature law : the zero rest - mass particles at the surface of the holostar will have a local radiation temperature proportional to @xmath380 . with the reasonable assumption that this is the true surface temperature of the holostar , one should be able to relate this temperature to the hawking temperature of a black hole of the same ( asymptotic gravitating ) mass .",
    "the hawking temperature is measured in the exterior space - time at _ spatial infinity_. as the exterior space - time of the holostar is pressure free , any particle moving out from the holostar s surface to infinity will undergo `` normal '' gravitational red - shift .",
    "the red - shift factor is given by the square - root of the time - coefficient of the metric at the position of the membrane , i.e. @xmath381 . multiplying the local surface temperature with this factor gives the holostar s temperature at infinity .",
    "we find @xmath382 .",
    "disregarding the rather small value of @xmath12 the hawking temperature of a black hole has exactly the same dependence on the gravitational radius @xmath383 as the holostar s local surface temperature , measured at infinity .",
    "we have just derived the hawking temperature up to a constant factor .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis shows that the factor is of order unity ( see also the discussion in section [ sec : holographic : principle ] ) . in @xcite",
    "a more definite relationship will be derived .",
    "turning the argument around one can use the hawking temperature to fix the local temperature at the holostar s boundary membrane .",
    "the local temperature of the membrane will blue - shifted with respect to the hawking temperature @xmath384 . setting the blue - shifted hawking temperature equal to the local temperature of the membrane @xmath385 we find :    @xmath386    knowing the local temperature within the holostar at one point allows one to determine the temperature at an arbitrary internal position :    @xmath387      with the above equation for the local temperature , the unknown length parameter @xmath12 can be estimated . raising equation ( [ eq : tlocal ] ) to the fourth power",
    "gives :    @xmath388    which implies :    @xmath389    under the assumption , that we live in a large holostar of cosmic proportions we can plug in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and the mean matter - density of the universe into the above equation . if the recent results from wmap @xcite are used , i.e. @xmath390 and @xmath391 , where @xmath392 is determined from the hubble - constant which is estimated to be approximately @xmath393 , we find :    @xmath394    which corresponds to @xmath395 .",
    "therefore @xmath12 is roughly twice the planck - length , which is quite in agreement to the theoretical prediction @xmath396 at low energies , obtained in @xcite .      in this and",
    "the following sections the radial motion of non zero rest - mass ( massive ) particles will be analyzed in somewhat greater detail .",
    "the main purpose of this analysis is to show , that as in the case of photons , geodesic motion of massive particles is self - consistent within the holostar solution , i.e. preserves the energy - density @xmath21 .",
    "it can not be stated clearly enough , though , that for massive particles geodesic motion is at best an approximation to the true motion of the particles within the pressurized fluid consisting of massive particles and photons alike .",
    "the radial pressure of the space - time will always exert an acceleration on a massive particle , so that massive particles can never move truly geodesically .",
    "however , we will see later , that whenever the geodesic acceleration slightly dominates over the pressure - induced acceleration , a massive particle will start to move outward and its motion will become geodesical for all practical purposes , whenever the particle has reached a radial position @xmath19 on the order of a few multiples of its starting position @xmath176 .",

    "the momentum transfer in the collision process decreases , the density becomes higher due to the inverse square law .",
    "the higher the density gets , the _ lower _ the radial pressure will become , as the pressure is negative : @xmath399 . the pressure - gradient is inward directed . although the absolute magnitude of the pressure gets higher towards the center , the gradient - and therefore the force associated with this gradient - points inward .",
    "] will result in an inward directed `` net - force '' acting on the massive particles .",
    "the acceleration by the pressure force @xmath400 can be estimated as follows for a particle in its momentary _ rest frame _ : , the proper acceleration in the particle s rest frame must be multiplied by the squared tangential @xmath10 factor at the turning point , i.e. @xmath401 . this slightly complicates the derivation .",

    "the first answer is to assume that @xmath457 .",
    "( we will see in section [ sec : unruh ] that @xmath458 can be proven rigorously . )",
    "although we do nt yet have the necessary machinery for a convincing derivation of this assumption , it is possible to give plausibility arguments : for a particle at @xmath444 `` inward '' motion is not an option .",
    "the uncertainty principle will not allow a definite localization of any particle at @xmath459 .",
    "see section [ sec : uncertainty ] for a thorough derivation .",
    "furthermore , according to the results of loop quantum gravity the region @xmath460 is not even well defined .",
    "no particle ( or geometric entity ) can have a surface area less than the minimum area quantum of loop quantum gravity , which is comparable to the planck area .",
    "therefore , from the loop perspective , the region @xmath104 will contain very few particles , no matter how many particles we try to `` force '' into this region .",
    "the same result follows from string theory .",
    "the equation of state of the holostar s interior matter is that of a collection of radial strings .",
    "the transverse dimension of the strings is equal to the planck area @xcite .",
    "it it not possible to `` compress '' a string along its longitudinal direction to a length that is much less than its transverse extension . therefore the region @xmath104 can contain only very few strings , no matter how hard we try to compress the strings in their longitudinal or transverse directions .",
    "we arrive at the not too unexpected result , that it will be impossible to force any quantum of matter ( particle or string ) into a region smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "this allows us to set up the following plausibility argument : if equation ( [ eq : rgeodesic2 ] ) would give @xmath257 , any particles within the region @xmath456 would be pushed towards the center .",
    "but there is a natural limit to the compression at @xmath461 and the holostar is a static solution , so the effective values of @xmath46 and @xmath403 must adjust in such a way , that @xmath225 .",
    "the second answer has to do with the fact , that ( for @xmath462 ) the temperature at the turning point of the motion is comparable to the particle s rest mass",
    ". therefore the ( unordered ) motion of the particles at this point will become relativistic . at relativistic energies we have to replace @xmath46 in equation ( [ eq : acc : equal ] ) with the total relativistic energy of the particle @xmath463 , which leads to @xmath464 .",
    "the equal sign in the above equation refers to the situation , when geodesic and pressure - induced acceleration are equal , i.e. when the situation is stationary . at ultrahigh temperature",
    "we find , that stationarity implies @xmath465 , meaning that the total energy of an ultra - relativistic particle must be proportional to its temperature @xmath161 , with the right proportionality factor @xmath466 .",
    "but the relation @xmath467 is well known from the thermodynamic relations for an ultra - relativistic gas .",

    "if @xmath466 has the right value , we can have a stationary situation over the full high temperature range @xmath456 .",

    "in the following discussion i will make the assumption , that the cross - sectional area @xmath403 - with respect to the `` pressure force '' - is comparable to the planck - area , i.e. @xmath484 , independent from the local temperature .",
    "this appears to be in conflict with the well known result for the strong , weak and electro - magnetic forces , for which the cross - sectional area @xmath403 depends on the collision energy in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "these cross - sections are definitely temperature dependent , as the average energy in the center - of - mass frame increases with temperature . however ,",
    "if the holostar pressure has a gravitational origin with a nearly planck size cross - sectional area , it is more natural to assume that the gravitational ( = geometric ! )",
    "cross - sectional area is unaffected by the relative motion of the colliding particles .",
    "the author is well aware , that the assumption of a ( more or less universal ) non - zero , nearly planck - size _ geometric _ cross - sectional area for an elementary particle is in conflict with the general belief ( which has its foundations in conventional qft ) that particles should be point - like .",
    "but the existence of truly point like particles is challenged by the two major competitors for a unified theory of quantum gravity .",

    "the geometry is flat right down to @xmath494 , so in the context of classical general relativity there appears to be no serious objection against this assumption . ]",
    "as the mass , charge and angular momentum of an `` elementary '' holostar with @xmath485 are zero , it can only interact with other particles by direct collision .",
    "its cross - sectional area @xmath403 will thus be equal to its geometric cross - sectional area .",
    "this area is independent of the energy of the colliding particles .",

    "we find from equation ( [ eq : acc : equal ] ) , that whenever the local temperature of one of the constituent particles of the holostar falls below roughly a third of its rest - mass , the outward directed geodesic acceleration becomes larger than the inward directed pressure - induced acceleration , allowing the particle to move outward on a trajectory which becomes more and more geodesical .",
    "we can now answer the question , what happens in the region of the holostar , where the temperature is higher than the rest - mass of the particle . for",
    "the stationary case ( no collective motion of particles in a particular direction ) the mass @xmath46 in equation ( [ eq : acc : equal ] ) should be replaced by the total mass - energy of the particle , @xmath497 .",

    "note that this section is highly speculative and trods into uncharted territory without the appropriate guide . on the other hand ,",
    "the issues addressed here must be solved in one way or the other , if the holostar is to be a truly self - consistent model , not only for black holes comparable to the mass of the sun , but for holostars of arbitrary size , up to and exceeding the observable radius of the universe .",
    "it might well be that the solution to the problems addressed in this section , if there is any , will turn out to be completely different from what is presented here .",
    "it is an astonishing coincidence , that the local temperature of the holostar at the radial position @xmath176 , i.e. where the net acceleration ( geodesic and pressure - induced ) becomes nearly zero for a particular particle , is roughly equal to the rest mass of the particle .",
    "at least this is the case , if the result @xmath520 , which was obtained independently in @xcite , is used .",
    "this can be regarded as an indication , that the negative radial pressure within the holostar is not just a curious mathematical feature of the solution , but could be a real , measurable physical effect , and that the assumption that the pressure is gravitational in origin , with a _ geometric _ cross - sectional area @xmath403 comparable to the planck - area , is not too far off the track .",
    "in fact , if the pressure were produced by a continuous flow of particles moving radially inward , and that interact only very weakly with the outflowing `` ordinary matter '' , this could explain the purely radial nature of the pressure .",
    "if the inflowing `` pressure - particles '' carry a mass - energy equivalent to that of the outflowing ordinary matter , this could at the same time explain the mystery , that the holostar is a static solution which requires that any outflow of mass - energy must be accompanied by an equivalent inflow.there is no mystery , as long as the outmoving particles reverse their outward directed motion in the exterior space - time and thus `` swing '' back and forth between exterior and interior space - time ( without friction ) , as suggested by the holostar equations of motion .",
    "the motion of the massive particles would be time - symmetric and any outmoving particle would be confronted by a highly relativistic flux of particles moving inward .",
    "the mystery arises , when we identify the holostar with the observable universe .",
    "it will be shown later , that any outmoving massive particle experiences an isotropic radially outward directed hubble - flow in its co - moving frame .",
    "this is exactly what we ourselves observe .",
    "however , our situation in the expanding universe appears time - asymmetric : we havent yet noticed a flow of particles hitting us head - on in our `` outward '' directed motion ( although we might already have noticed the effects of the inflowing matter in the form of `` dark energy '' , i.e. a negative pressure ) .",
    "this must not altogether be a contradiction .",
    "first , if the outflowing and inflowing matter moves highly relativistically , as is expected from the holostar equations of motion for a single massive particle , the cross - sectional area for a collision between an outmoving `` matter particle '' and an in - moving `` pressure particle '' can become almost arbitrarily small , as @xmath521 for ordinary matter . secondly , the outflowing and the inflowing particles must not necessarily be the same .",
    "the inflowing particles could be decay products of the outmoving particles or altogether different species .",
    "any weakly interacting `` dark matter '' particle would probably qualify .",
    "if the inflowing particles interact only weakly with the outflowing `` ordinary '' matter , they could deliver an inward - directed energy flow comparable to the outward directed flow and a time - symmetric situation with respect to the net energy flow could be restored . ]",
    "the most conservative assumption is , that the ( inflowing ) pressure particles are nothing else than the outflowing matter particles , that have reversed their motion in the exterior space - time and are now coming back",
    ". we would nt be able to notice the inflowing matter , if the motion of out- and inflowing matter is highly relativistic .",
    "this is actually the case in the holostar s interior .",
    "any massive particle moving nearly geodesically has an extremely high @xmath10-factor , growing with the square - root of the radial coordinate value .",
    "for instance , a particle starting out from the center @xmath522 will have @xmath523 , when it has reached a radial position corresponding to the current radius and density of our universe .",
    "the cross - sectional area for the collision of an inflowing with an outflowing electron in the center of mass - frame then is roughly given by    @xmath524    the cross - sectional area for a nucleon will be even lower .",
    "these are utterly negligible cross - sections , so that for the low densities encountered currently in our universe the inflowing `` pressure particles '' will just pass through the outflowing matter without any reaction at all : if one assumes , that the in- and outflowing matter is distributed uniformly , i.e. most of the matter does not reside in black holes , the probability for one reaction to occur for all of the @xmath525 particles in the observable universe is roughly @xmath526 , if one is willing to wait for a time comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "it is quite likely , that the standard form of the high energy cross - sectional area ( @xmath527 ) has to be modified for collision energies above the planck energy .",
    "can be extended to cross - sectional areas of sub - planck scale , or whether we have to modify the formula , so that the cross - sectional area corresponds to the cross - sectional area of the intermediate ( virtual ) black hole state , which is proportional to @xmath528 . for the second option one",

    "as long as one does not know the exact nature of the pressure in the holostar space - time , the assumption @xmath445 might turn out to be vastly incorrect . without having solved the equations of motion including pressure ( with the correct value of @xmath403 ) one can not exclude the possibility , that the motion of the particles in the holostar turns out to be extremely non - geodesic . in the most extreme case the true motion of the particles might not even be highly relativistic , so that the argument with respect to the low cross - sectional areas for geodesically moving particles does not apply .",
    ", a geodesically moving observer experiences an isotropic hubble flow in his frame of reference . however , the perceived isotropy of the local hubble flow in the co - moving frame is tied to the assumption , that the motion is geodesic : only ( nearly ) geodesic motion gives the right @xmath10-factor , and thus the `` right '' amount of lorentz - contraction in radial direction of the co - moving frame , so that the expansion - rates in the radial and the tangential directions are equal . ]",
    "if the holostar is to remain a model for the universe under such - somewhat unlikely - conditions , the inflowing `` pressure particles '' can not be ordinary matter , as a non - relativistic inflow of ordinary matter would not have gone un - noticed on our presumably outward directed track .",
    "whenever `` ordinary matter '' and `` pressure - particles '' must be regarded as distinct , we arrive at two conditions that should be met by the `` pressure particles '' :    * the pressure particles should interact very weakly with ordinary matter ( at least at energies below roughly 1 mev ) * the mass - energy density of the pressure particles should be equivalent to the mass - energy density of ordinary matter    the first condition can - in principle - be fulfilled by several particles .",
    "the graviton , the supposed messenger particle for the gravitational force , looks like a suitable candidate .",
    "the second condition suggests that supersymmetric matter might be the preferred candidate for the pressure - particles , if they exist : it seems quite improbable that massless gravitons , with only two degrees of freedom , can deliver an energy flow exactly equal to the energy flow of ordinary matter at any arbitrary radial position within the holostar . but",
    "exact supersymmetry predicts equal numbers and masses of the supersymmetric particles . if the `` pressure particles '' were the supersymmetric partners of ordinary matter , it might be possible to fulfil the second condition quite trivially.- or @xmath534-mass . in this case the negative radial pressure could still be generated by an appreciable , but not too high number - density of the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) . ] furthermore , for interaction energies below the electro - weak unification scale supersymmetric matter and ordinary matter are effectively decoupled .",
    "supersymmetric matter therefore fits both conditions well .",
    "note also , that the holostar solution assumes that the cosmological constant @xmath38 is exactly zero .",
    "exact supersymmetry is quite well suited to explain a zero value for @xmath38 .",
    "therefore - from a purely theoretical point of view - we would get a much more consistent description of the phenomena , if supersymmetry were realized exactly , not only at high energies and densities , but also in the low density / low energy regions of a large holostar .    if the principal agents of the negative radial pressure consist of supersymmetric matter , this requires an efficient mechanism which converts the outflowing ordinary matter into the supersymmetric `` pressure - particles '' .",
    "this process is expected to take place in the membrane .",
    "the membrane is in many respects similar to a two - dimensional domain wall .",
    "therefore the membrane could induce interactions similar to the conversion processes that are believed to take place when ordinary matter crosses a two - dimensional domain wall . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lightest supersymmetric particle were light enough , ordinary matter could just decay into the lightest superparticle anywhere on its way outward .",
    "supersymmetry might also provide the solution to the problem , why the `` pressure particles '' ( bosons ? ) preferably move inward , whereas ordinary matter ( fermions ? ) moves outward .",
    "have a higher cross - sectional area than the fermions , for which we find that @xmath535 ( in the supersymmetric case @xmath536 , see the tables in @xcite ) .",
    "the pressure induced acceleration is proportional to the cross - sectional area of the particles , so that bosons will be subject to a higher pressure - induced acceleration than fermions . in the holostar s",
    "interior the pressure - induced acceleration is always inward - directed , whereas the geodesic acceleration is outward directed . for ultra - relativistic particles",
    "the net - acceleration is zero when @xmath537 , where @xmath511 is the mean entropy per particle ( averaged over all particles , i.e. bosons , fermions and anti - fermions ; @xmath538 in a supersymmetric context ) . in the holostar space - time it can be shown that @xmath539 and @xmath540 , always @xcite . therefore the motion of the bosons will be dominated by the inward directed pressure - induced acceleration , whereas the motion of the fermions is dominated by the geodesic outward directed acceleration , which naturally leads to the conjecture , that fermions preferentially move outward and bosons inward .",
    "note that by this argument the anti - fermions would preferentially move inward as well , because @xmath541 such behavior would be easier to understand if one could think up a mechanism that explains this time - asymmetric situation : if geodesic movement in the holostar were fully @xmath161-symmetric , the time reversed process would be equally likely , in which case the `` pressure - particles '' should be ordinary matter ( or anti - matter ) . in the following argument",
    "i make use of the fact , that the membrane appears as the primary source of gravitational attraction in the low density region of the holostar , at least for ordinary matter .",
    "could the membrane expel the `` pressure particles '' , after the interactions in the membrane have converted ordinary matter into supersymmetric `` pressure particles '' ?",
    "the gravitational force is always attractive , unless we were able to find some form of matter with @xmath542 .",
    "this is the point where supersymmetry might come up with an answer : the higgs - field , which is expected to give mass to the particles of the standard model , is characterized by a quantity @xmath543 , which is usually identified with the mass squared of the field . whenever @xmath544 , all particles of the standard model are massless .",
    "whenever @xmath543 falls below zero , the higgs - mechanism kicks in . in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model the dependence of @xmath543 on the energy / distance - scale can be calculated .",
    "it turns out that @xmath543 is positive at the planck - scale and becomes negative close to the energy scale of the standard - model .",
    "therefore the condition @xmath542 will be fulfilled in the problematic low - density region of the holostar , i.e. whenever @xmath545 .",
    "the peculiar property @xmath542 of the higgs - field at low energies therefore might provide the mechanism , by which supersymmetric matter is rather expelled from the membrane , whereas ordinary matter is attracted .",
    "if supersymmetry can actually provide such a mechanism , we could understand why the holostar is a static solution , not only for small holostars in the whole interior , all of its constituent particles should be massless . for massless particles the condition @xmath546 is trivially fulfilled . if @xmath547 the pressure - induced inward directed acceleration and the geodesic outward directed acceleration are equal throughout the whole interior . in such a case",
    "the holostar is truly static , time - symmetric and in thermal equilibrium .",

    "the geodesic equation of pure radial motion for a massive particle , starting out at rest from @xmath549 , is given by equation ( [ eq : beta : r2:m : radial ] ) :    @xmath550    the above equation is only correct for pure radial motion .",
    "however , we are interested in the characteristic features of the motion _ far away _ from its turning point @xmath176 . as has already been remarked in section [ sec : eq : motion ] , the general case of geodesic motion is very well approximated by the above equation ( for @xmath197 ) , if one replaces @xmath417 , where @xmath269 is the tangential @xmath10-factor at the turning point of the motion .",

    "this factor is very close to unity , as can be shown by the following simplified argument :    the number - density of the zero rest - mass particles scales with @xmath373 .",

    "if one evaluates the entropy according to the hawking - formula , ignoring the thermal radiation bath , the mass - estimate fails miserably : one gets a bound which is far too low : @xmath682 .      in this section",
    "i will examine the equations of motion from the viewpoint of a moving massive particle , i.e. from the viewpoint of the co - moving material observer who moves geodesically .",
    "the geodesic equation of radial motion for a massive particle , expressed in terms of its own proper time , is given by :    @xmath683    the radial coordinate velocity @xmath684 is nearly constant for @xmath197 .",
    "integration of the above equation gives :    @xmath685    for large @xmath197 this can be simplified :    @xmath686    the proper time it takes a material observer to move along a radial geodesic trajectory through the holostar space - time is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "this is very much different from what the external asymptotic observer sees .",
    "the time measured by an exterior clock at infinity has been shown to be proportional to @xmath338 .    under the assumption that we live in a large holostar formula ( [ eq : tau ] ) is quite consistent with the age of the universe , unless @xmath687 . , it is quite unlikely , that any particle can be emitted from @xmath687 . ]",
    "as can be seen from equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) , it takes a material observer roughly the current age of the universe in order to travel geodesically from the planck - density region at the holostar s center ( i.e. at @xmath688 ) to the low density region at @xmath689 , where the density is comparable to the density of the universe observed today : for @xmath458 we find @xmath690 , if @xmath691 .",
    "the proper time of travel could be much longer : if a massive particle is emitted ( with zero velocity ) from @xmath196 , the proper time of travel to radial position @xmath19 is larger than the former value by the square root ratio of @xmath176 to @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the holostar solution is compatible with the age of the oldest objects in our universe ( @xmath692 ) , but would also allow a much older age .    note , that the holostar solution has no need for inflation .",
    "the `` scale factor '' @xmath19 develops proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the `` expansion '' , defined by the local hubble - radius , also develops proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "therefore any causally connected region remains causally connected during the `` expansion '' .",
    "the causal horizon and the particle - horizon remain always proportional to each other .",
    "furthermore the number - density law @xmath693 for massive particles indicates , that very massive particles that have decoupled kinematically from the radiation at an early epoch , such as magnetic monopoles , become very much thinned out with respect to the radiation or the lighter particles , such as baryons , which decouple much later .      from equation ( [ eq : redshift1 ] ) a linear redshift - distance relation",
    "can be derived , which is in some sense similar to the redshift - distance relations of the standard robertson walker models of the universe .",
    "imagine a concentric shell of material observers moving radially outward through the holostar .",
    "place two observers in galaxies at the inner and outer surfaces of the shell and another observer in a galaxy midway between the two outer observers .",
    "when the observer in the middle reaches radial coordinate position @xmath212 , the two other observers are instructed to emit a photon with frequency @xmath368 in direction of the middle observer . at this moment the proper radial thickness of the shell , i.e. the proper distance between the two outer galaxies , shall be @xmath694 .",
    "let the three galaxies travel geodesically outward .",
    "some million years later ( depending on how large @xmath694 has been chosen ) , the photons from the edge - galaxies will finally reach the observer in the middle galaxy .",
    "the observer in the middle determines his radial coordinate position at the time of absorption , @xmath365 . according to equation ( [ eq : redshift1 ] ) the photons",
    "will have been red - shifted by the squareroot of the ratio of @xmath695 . in order to derive the redshift - distance relation we only need to know , how the proper distance between the galaxies has changed as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "according to equation ( [ eq : delta_l : m ] ) the proper radial distance grows proportional to the square - root of the radial coordinate value , whenever the galaxies move geodesically :    @xmath696    the final result is , that the light emitted from the distant galaxies is red - shifted by the ratio of the proper distances of the galaxies at the time of emission to the time of absorption .",
    "however , this is the result that an observer at rest in the ( @xmath697)-coordinate system would see .",
    "the co - moving observer will find a different relation ( see also the discussion in the following section and in section [ sec : frames ] ) .",
    "for the co - moving observer the proper radial distance has to be multiplied with his special relativistic @xmath10-factor .",
    "if we denote the proper separation between the galaxies in the system of the co - moving observer with an overline , we find :    @xmath698    if we insert this into equation ( [ eq : redshiftdistance ] ) the result is :    @xmath699    this result might seem paradoxical .",
    "however , this is exactly what the co - moving observer must see : the stress - energy tensor of the holostar space - time is radially boost invariant . therefore any radial boost should not affect the local physics .",
    "this means that in the co - moving frame , as well as in the coordinate frame , the frequency of the photons should be proportional to the local radiation temperature , i.e. @xmath700 . the local radiation temperature , however , depends on the inverse square - root of the radial coordinate value : @xmath701 . due to lorentz contraction ( or rather lorentz - elongation in the co - moving frame )",
    "the proper distance @xmath702 in the radial direction between two geodesically moving massive particles develops proportional to @xmath19 ( see also the next section ) .",
    "putting all this together gives : @xmath703 .      with the equations of motion for massive particles one can show , that an observer co - moving with the massive particles within the outmoving shell will see an isotropic hubble - type expansion of the massive particles with respect to his point of view .",
    "first let us calculate the hubble - flow viewed by the co - moving observer in the tangential direction , by analyzing how the proper distance between the radially moving observer and a neighboring radially moving particle develops .",
    "i.e. observer and particle always have the same @xmath19-coordinate value . because of spherical symmetry",
    "the coordinate system can be chosen such , that both move in the plane @xmath704 .",

    "for the derivation of the hubble parameter in the radial direction the lorentz - contraction due to the relativistic motion has to be taken into account .",
    "the proper radial separation of two particles in geodesic motion , as seen by the observer at rest in the ( @xmath200 , @xmath19 , @xmath713 , @xmath208 ) coordinate system , develops as :    @xmath714    this formula has to be corrected . due to the relative motion of the co - moving observer , the observer at rest in the ( @xmath200",
    ", @xmath19 , @xmath713 , @xmath208 ) coordinate system will see a proper length , which has been lorentz - contracted . therefore the co - moving observer must measure a proper length which is larger by the special relativistic @xmath10-factor . in the system of the co - moving observer the formula for the proper length ( denoted by barred quantities ) is then given by :    @xmath715    this gives :    @xmath716    the radial and the tangential local hubble - values are equal .",

    "nearly geodesic motion through the hot interior region of the holostar space time , starting out from @xmath444 , seems only conceivable for a massive particle of roughly planck mass which only interacts weakly with the other particles .",
    "somewhere on its trajectory , not too far from the radial coordinate value where the temperature has dropped below the electro - weak unification scale , the particle ( or its intermediate decay products ) must have decayed into ordinary matter , endowing the stable final products ( electrons , protons , neutrons and neutrinos - or more generally the light quark / leptons ) with the high momentum gathered on its outward track . this scenario - although well within the limits of standard physics - is quite an extravagant claim , for which it would be helpful to have another - independent - verification .",

    "the unruh - temperature at @xmath953 will be twice the radiation temperature ( see section [ sec : unruh ] ) .",
    "the energy of a particle produced by unruh radiation therefore is @xmath954 .",
    "the production of a preon by unruh radiation poses no problem , even if the high chemical potential of the ultra - relativistic particles , @xmath955 , in the holostar is taken into account .",
    "so far the case @xmath956 was discussed .",
    "the mass of the preon @xmath933 depends on @xmath920 , albeit only moderately .",

    "[ tab : preon : mass ] the mass @xmath933 and the tangential velocity @xmath177 of the preon is given for several values of @xmath920 :    c||c|c|c @xmath920 & @xmath177 & @xmath912 & @xmath933 + 1/2 & 0.647 & 1.65 & 0.165 + 3/4 & 0.553 & 1.72 & 0.188 + 1 & 0.490 & 1.77 & 0.201 + 3/2 & 0.405 & 1.83 & 0.218 + 2 & 0.353 & 1.87 & 0.228 + 5/2 & 0.316 & 1.89 & 0.234 + 3 & 0.288 & 1.91 & 0.238 + 4 & 0.250 & 1.93 & 0.243 +     +    if equation ( [ eq : delta : p ] ) for the density evolution ( with pressure ) is correct , @xmath920 should lie in the range @xmath959 , so that the bound for the preon mass will be roughly @xmath960 in planck units .",
    "@xmath961 also fits better with the current measurements of the hubble - constant ( see section [ sec : measurement ] ) .",
    "we find , that if the current expansion rate of the universe and the evolution of the density perturbations after decoupling can be ( approximately ) described by the holostar solution , one requires a new particle .",
    "its properties can be quite accurately inferred from the above discussion : its mass should be less than one quarter of the planck mass .",
    "its exact value should nt lie too far outside the mass range given by equation ( [ eq : preon : mass : range ] ) .",
    "the particle - or its decay products - should interact only weakly with the other particles at energies above the electro - weak scale .",
    "it is possible to estimate the mass of the preon by another , independent argument . according to the discussion in section [ sec : uncertainty ] the proper volume occupied by a single particle at the holostar s center is given by    @xmath962    on its way outward the volume available to the preon will become larger , which enables it to decay into lighter particles , such as neutrons , protons and electrons .",
    "the decay is expected to conserve mass - energy locally . what will the energy - density of the stable decay products be at large @xmath19-values ? to simplify the calculations it is convenient to consider a thought - experiment , in which the proper expansion in the radial direction is zero .",
    "this thought - experiment simplifies the calculations as we do nt have to take into account any changes of the internal energy in a radially expanding volume due to the non - zero radial pressure .",
    "any motion leaving the internal energy of a spherically outmoving shell of particles unaffected , requires that the proper thickness of the shell remains constant , i.e. the volume develops as the proper surface area of the concentric spherical shell , i.e. @xmath567 .    at the radial position @xmath963 , which corresponds to the radius of the observable universe today , the volume @xmath964 will have expanded to :    @xmath965    assuming local mass - energy conservation and assuming that the mass - energy of the preon ends up predominantly in nucleons ( i.e. no significant dark matter component ; energy - contributions of electrons , neutrinos and photons negligible with respect to the baryons ) , the total number of nucleons within this volume will be given by :    @xmath966    if the mass - energy of the preon is assumed to be @xmath967 . from equations ( [ eq :",
    "v : today ] , [ eq : n : proton : from : preon ] ) the number - density of nucleons in the universe today can be estimated as :    @xmath968    amounting to roughly @xmath969 nucleons per cubic meter .",
    "this is very close to the number - density of nucleons in the universe derived from the total matter - density determined by wmap assuming no significant dark matter component , @xmath970 ( see section [ sec : measurement ] ) .",
    "therefore a preon - mass in the range between @xmath971 to @xmath972 planck masses is quite consistent with the findings in the observable universe today .",
    "the assumption that the preon eventually decays into nucleons at a temperature slightly below the nucleon rest - mass , enables us to give a - very crude - estimate for the absolute value of the density contrast @xmath174 at the time of baryogenesis .",
    "astoundingly this crude estimate fits quite well with the experimentally determined values of the density contrast today @xmath866 and at the time of decoupling @xmath973 :    the red - shift @xmath974 where the mean energy of the radiation is equal to the nucleon rest - mass is given as :    @xmath975    at this redshift the number - density of the nucleons @xmath976 in the holostar space - time will be higher than today by a factor of @xmath977 , i.e.    @xmath978    which corresponds to a matter - density of @xmath979 .",
    "this value is roughly a factor of thousand higher than the typical neutron star density and four orders of magnitude higher than the typical density of stable nuclei .",
    "if the nucleons in our universe originate from the preon at roughly this redshift , one would expect a density - contrast @xmath980 on the order of the nucleon to preon mass at this time .",
    "with a preon mass @xmath981 we find    @xmath982    as has been shown in section [ sec : delta : rho ] the density contrast evolves as a power - law with respect to the redshift . for @xmath983 the exponent",
    "is given by @xmath984 in the radiation dominated era , so that :    @xmath985    therefore we can `` predict '' the density - contrast at any redshift @xmath986 from the density - contrast at the time of baryogenesis .",
    "we find :    @xmath987    with @xmath988 and    @xmath989    however , keep in mind that as long as not much is known about the particle spectrum at energies above the electro - weak scale this `` prediction '' stands on more than shaky ground .",
    "the string - character of the holostar space - time allows an alternative explanation , not only for the absolute value of the density perturbations but also for the scale - invariant spectrum of the cmbr - fluctuations found by wmap .",
    "as this has been discussed elsewhere , i will just give a very short summary of the presentation in peacock @xcite :    it is easy to see , that the holostar s interior space - time can be interpreted as a collection of strings , aligned in the radial direction .",
    "for a string - dominated universe one finds the following rough estimate for the horizon - scale amplitude @xmath990 :    @xmath991    as @xmath992 numbers close to the characteristic value @xmath993 can arise quite naturally .",
    "because of the way in which the string network scales , the density perturbations generated by stringy matter have an approximately scale invariant spectrum . however , string structure formation is generally non - gaussian in nature",
    ". therefore it might be possible to detect a non - gaussian string signature in the small - scale cmbr anisotropies",
    "so far the maximum angular correlation distance of the microwave background radiation ( @xmath994 ) has been put in by hand , as determined from the observations .",
    "it would be nice , if this value could be derived by first principles .",
    "there appears to be a way to do this . for this purpose",
    "let us consider the angular spread of zero mass particles in the holostar .",
    "the maximum angular spread for a photon emitted from @xmath176 is given by :    @xmath995    let us consider photon - pair production ( or the production of any other massless particle in pairs ) by unruh radiation .",
    "this process will be most efficient if the unruh - temperature is high . in section [ sec : unruh ] the following relation between radiation temperature and unruh - temperature will be derived :    @xmath996    for @xmath997 the unruh temperature is twice the radiation temperature , so that photon pair production by the unruh - effect should be a common occurrence in the central region of the holostar .",
    "unruh creation of photon pairs is most efficient at the most central conceivable location available for a particle within the holostar space - time . according to the discussion in section [ sec : uncertainty ] there are many good reasons to believe , that @xmath997 is the `` closest '' conceivable position that any one particle can occupy at the holostar s center .",
    "if we insert the ratio @xmath998 into equation ( [ eq : max : angle : photon ] ) we get :    @xmath999    voil@xmath1000 .",
    "finally it should be noted , that @xmath1001 makes the `` expansion '' of particles that move radially outward in the holostar space - time nearly equal in the radial and the tangential directions : @xmath1002 , whereas @xmath1003 .      if one compares the theoretical prediction for the hubble constant , the theoretical prediction for the evolution of the density perturbation amplitudes and maximum correlation angle with the cosmological observations , all methods favor @xmath225 , meaning that the particles making up our universe must have originated from a region @xmath899 .",
    "is it conceivable , that the particles could have originated from an interior position very much closer to the center ?",
    "it is easy to see that the answer is no .",
    "any particle located close to the holostar s center will have a mean momentum comparable to the planck - momentum .",
    "however , any particle must be subject to the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "if we set the momentum uncertainty @xmath1004 of the particle equal to its mean ( thermal ) momentum at @xmath176 , and the uncertainty in position @xmath1005 equal to to @xmath176 , the uncertainty relation reads :    @xmath1006    with @xmath1007 we find the following inequality for @xmath738 :    @xmath1008    quite evidently this is not an exact result , as @xmath1009 and @xmath1010 .",
    "still one can expect this relation to be correct within a factor of two or three .",
    "we find that any particle in the holostar s center will not be able to occupy a region ( or originate from a region ) much smaller than @xmath518 .",
    "there are some other independent reasons to believe , that @xmath12 - or rather @xmath1011 - provides a universal cut - off for the region that can by occupied by any one particle in the holostar space - time .",
    "first , it does not seem possible that more than one particle will be able to enter - or occupy - the region bounded by the smallest possible area quantum of loop quantum gravity , which turns out to be roughly equal to @xmath1012 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the smallest `` separation '' between two particles should be roughly equal to @xmath12 , as far as semi - classical reasoning can still be trusted at the planck scale .",
    "second , in @xcite the number of particles within a spherical concentric region in the holostar space - time has been determined as @xmath1013 ( as @xmath1007 ) .",
    "this relation was derived in the context of microscopic statistical thermodynamics , which generally requires macroscopic @xmath666 . extrapolating this relation to the planck - scale using the experimental estimate @xmath1014 from equation ( [ eq : r0 ^ 2:est ] ) we find that @xmath1015 for @xmath1016 .",
    "a third argument is this : in @xcite it has been shown , that @xmath950 is the radial position of the membrane of an elementary extremely charged holostar with zero ( or negligible ) mass .",
    "a holostar with @xmath1017 is the smallest holostar possible : any holostar with @xmath1018 necessarily has negative mass .    therefore any particle coming from the holostar s hot central region will appear to have originated from @xmath225 for an observer situated a large distance from the center . whether the particle was created at the hot central region , or whether an inmoving particle merely reversed its motion at @xmath444 ( or was reflected from the center by a small angle ) is quite irrelevant to the general picture .      in this section the total local mass - energy density @xmath16 , the local hubble value @xmath41 , the radial coordinate value @xmath19 and the proper time @xmath17 in a `` holostar universe '' will be determined from the temperature of the microwave background radiation .",
    "the total energy density in the holostar universe can be determined from the radiation temperature , whenever @xmath79 is known .",
    "it is given by equation ( [ eq : t4/rho ] ) :    @xmath1019    there is some significant theoretical evidence for @xmath1020 at the low energy scale .",
    "however @xmath1021 or a value a few percent higher than @xmath1022 might also be possible ( for a somewhat more detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "with @xmath1023 and @xmath1024 we find :    @xmath1025    this is almost equal to the total matter - density of the universe determined by wmap @xcite :    @xmath1026    from the matter density the radial coordinate position @xmath19 within the holostar can be determined .    @xmath1027    this value is quite close the radius of the observable universe .",
    "the local hubble - constant can be determined from the matter density via equation ( [ eq : hubble ] ) :    @xmath1028    with @xmath1029 and the matter density determined beforehand we find :    @xmath1030 = 62.36 \\ , [ \\frac{km / s}{mpc}]\\ ] ]    the hubble - constant comes out quite close to the value that is used in the concordance model by the wmap - group @xcite with @xmath1031 .",
    "this is an encouraging result .",
    "note , however , that the value of the hubble constant is model - dependent .",
    "it is possible to relate the hubble value @xmath1032 of the various versions of the standard cosmological models to the hubble value @xmath1033 of the holostar solution via the mass - density . in the standard cosmological models we find :    @xmath1034    for the holostar",

    "keep in mind , however , that the wmap - result for the age of the universe is strongly correlated with the prior on the hubble - constant via the relation @xmath1043 .",
    "in fact , it is the product @xmath1044 which has been determined to the remarkably high accuracy stated by the wmap group . in order to determine @xmath41 or @xmath200 individually to the same accuracy , independent measurements for @xmath41 ( or @xmath200 )",
    "are required , such as provided by the concordance model .",
    "if we set @xmath1045 we find an almost perfect agreement of the holostar s predictions for the local hubble value @xmath1046 ( km / s)/mpc and the current proper time @xmath1047 compared to the values determined by wmap @xcite , @xmath1048 ( km / s)/mpc and @xmath1049 .",
    "the holostar solution is quite compatible with the recent findings concerning the large scale structure and dynamics of the universe .",
    "the recent wmap results are reproduced best by setting @xmath1050 . from the evolution of the density perturbations ( see section [ sec : delta : rho ] ) one would rather expect @xmath1051 .",
    "it is quite clear that @xmath738 can not lie very much outside the range @xmath1052 , which corresponds to an age of the universe in the range between @xmath1053 .",
    "note that the above age comes close to the ages of the oldest globular clusters .",
    "if @xmath738 is chosen larger than unity , the proper time @xmath17 in the holostar universe will be larger . for @xmath1054 the holostar universe can easily accommodate even the old estimates for the ages of the globular clusters , which not too far ago have been thought to lie between @xmath1055 to @xmath1056 billion years .",
    "the problem with such an assignment is , that the hubble value comes out far too low . for @xmath259",
    "we find @xmath1057 ( km / s)/mpc , which appears incompatible with today s experimental measurements , even if the large systematic errors in calibrating the cosmological distance scale are taken into account .    from a theoretical point of",
    "view @xmath458 appears as the most preferable choice ( see for instance the discussion in section [ sec : unruh ] ) . however , this choice is based on an extrapolation of the classical geodesic equations motion from large distances back to roughly a planck distance from the holostar s center .",
    "it is questionable whether classical reasoning at the planck - energy scale will remain valid , so that one should expect some moderate adjustment due the quantum nature of space - time at this scale .",
    "therefore it is too early to make a definite numerical prediction for the ratio @xmath738 ( measured via the hubble - constant at late times ) .",
    "if @xmath738 can be pinned down theoretically we are in the very much desirable position to make a precise prediction for the hubble value , which should be an order of magnitude better than today s measurement capabilities .",
    "therefore any significant advances in the understanding of the motion of particles in the holostar universe could be of high practical value for the development of a `` high precision cosmology '' in the near future .",
    "another important quantity that can be determined from the the radiation temperature is the entropy density @xmath6 . according to equation ( [ eq : s = g ] )",
    "the entropy - density is given by :    @xmath1058    replacing @xmath19 with the radiation temperature via equation ( [ eq : tlocal ] ) we find :    @xmath1059    with @xmath1060 and inserting the cmbr - temperature we get the following prediction for the local entropy - density :    @xmath1061    it appears , that this entropy density is quite in conflict with the entropy - density in our universe , which - according to the common belief - is thought to be dominated by the entropy in the cmbr - radiation .",
    "the entropy - density of the cmbr is roughly three orders of magnitude lower , @xmath1062 .",
    "however , this point of view does not take the entropy of the nucleons ( and electrons ) properly into account .",
    "it is a - strangely - utterly ignored result from microscopic statistical thermodynamics , that the entropy @xmath1063 per massive particle in the non - relativistic limit is given by :    @xmath1064    in units ( @xmath446 ) .",

    "@xmath853 is the total energy per particle , including the kinetic energy @xmath1066 .",
    "if one assumes @xmath1067 for massive particles , the entropy per massive particle remains small .. at low energies , i.e. in chemical reactions between different massive particles ( = molecules ) one does not measure the absolute value of the chemical potential , but rather the difference of the chemical potentials of the reacting species . at high energies the chemical potentials of the particles are usually taken to be zero .",
    "] in a self - consistent space - time , i.e. a space - time that can be considered to be a closed thermodynamical system to a good approximation , this assumption quite likely is not correct .",
    "for instance , for a spherically symmetric black hole we know that the entropy is a function of the energy alone @xmath1068 .",
    "the number of particles within a black hole is undefined .",
    "but the chemical potential is defined as the energy change at _ constant _ entropy , when a particle is added to the system . for a spherically symmetric black hole",
    "this energy - change is zero : adding a particle _ at constant entropy _ does not change the total energy of the system , because of the definite relation @xmath1069 . therefore the chemical potential of the `` interior particles '' must be zero .",
    "something similar applies to the holostar .",
    "a holostar has a definite number of particles - at least on average and at high temperatures .",
    "but again there is a definite relation between total mass @xmath77 , temperature at infinity @xmath161 and entropy , i.e. @xmath1070 . as long as the total mass - energy of the holostar does not change , the total entropy remains constant .",
    "therefore any _ internal _ fluctuations of particle - numbers neither change the total energy , nor the total entropy of the whole system .",
    "the chemical potential should be zero .    somewhat more formally :    @xmath1071    @xmath1072 refer to exterior parameters of the system , such as angular momentum or charge . for a closed system",
    "the exterior ( conserved ) quantities need not be considere",
    ". if @xmath621 only depends on @xmath626 , as is the case for the total energy and entropy of a black hole or holostar , the partial derivatives of @xmath626 with respect to @xmath666 and @xmath627 must be zero .",
    "but @xmath1073 at fixed @xmath1074 is nothing else than the definition for the chemical potential @xmath1075 .",
    "therefore - seen from a _ global _ perspective , the chemical potential of any interior particle must be zero in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to assume , that that the chemical potential of the massive particles is zero in the holostar s interior space - time . in this case",
    "the constant factor @xmath1076 in equation ( [ eq : s : m ] ) can be neglected , when the temperature is well below the rest - mass of a particular particle , so that    @xmath1077    therefore in the matter - dominated era the entropy - density in the holostar universe is given by :    @xmath1078    the contribution from the three known stable massive particle species ( protons , neutrons and electrons ) and the two known massless species ( photons and neutrinos ) to the entropy - density was included .",
    "if the reader likes , he can double the photon - contribution in order to include a `` graviton '' contribution .",
    "the entropy - density of the cbmr - radiation @xmath1079 is given by :    @xmath1080    @xmath1081 is the number of degrees of the cmbr - photons . under the assumption that the neutrinos have zero chemical potential , we have to use a weighting factor of @xmath1082 for every fermionic degree of freedom .",
    "therefore the entropy - density of the radiation , including three neutrinos with one helicity state , is given by using equation ( [ eq : s : rad ] ) and replacing @xmath1083 . in order to calculate the entropy - density we need to know the number - densities of protons , neutrons and electrons . if our universe consists out of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , as is suggested by the observations , we furthermore need to know the masses and number - densities of the dark matter .",
    "however , equation ( [ eq : s : total ] ) tells us , that for non - relativistic matter it suffices to know @xmath1084 , which is nothing else than total energy - density of all forms of non - relativistic matter @xmath1085 .",
    "we find :    @xmath1086    for radiation ( with zero chemical potential ) the entropy - density and the energy - density is related by :    @xmath1087    inserting this into equation ( [ eq : s : total : rho ] ) gives :    @xmath1088    the total matter - density has been very accurately determined by wmap .",
    "using @xmath1089 , @xmath1090 and the measured value for the cmbr - temperature we find experimentally :    @xmath1091    the experimental value is almost equal to the theoretical calculation .",
    "equation ( [ eq : s : total : rho ] ) contains a very interesting message . in the matter - dominated era of our universe",
    "we can neglect the radiation - contribution to the entropy - density . in this case",
    "the entropy - density is nothing else than the energy - density divided by @xmath161 :    @xmath1092    equation ( [ eq : st : rho ] ) allows us to determine the free energy @xmath508 in the interior holostar space - time .",
    "@xmath1093    we find the remarkable result , that the free energy is minimized to zero , whenever @xmath1094 .",

    "@xmath1095 is zero everywhere in the interior space - time .    from equation ( [ eq : s :",
    "total : rho:2 ] ) one would assume , that the relation @xmath1094 is only valid approximately in the matter - dominated era , when the radiation contribution to the total energy - density can be neglected . this will be the case whenever the average interior radiation temperature lies below the nucleon - rest mass , which requires @xmath1096 .",
    "for any smaller - radiation dominated - holostar we expect , that the entropy - density is higher by a factor of @xmath1097 .",
    "but this is in gross conflict with the general result derived in section [ sec : s = g ] , equation ( [ eq : s = e / t ] ) , according to which @xmath1098 , _ independent _ of the type of the interior matter .",
    "any deviation from this result would lead to an entropy ( or temperature at infinity ) which is not even proportional to the hawking entropy or temperature .    whereas for large matter - dominated holostars the proportionality between the holostar s entropy and the hawking entropy is obvious , small radiation dominated holostars with @xmath1099 appear to be incompatible with the hawking entropy - area formula .",
    "although one might expect some modification of the hawking - formula at very high energies , close to the planck energy , a modification that sets in for black holes with roughly 1 % of the mass of the sun ( or less ) seems awkward .",
    "even worse , it does not help to replace the factor @xmath1100 in the hawking entropy - area formula with a different factor .",
    "this does not work , because equation ( [ eq : s : total : rho:2 ] ) not only contains the entropy , but also the temperature : @xmath8 .",
    "any constant rescaling of the hawking entropy leaves the product @xmath625 undisturbed .",
    ", which must be valid in the exterior space - time . ]    it does nt help either , to change the total interior matter - density by the unwanted factor @xmath1097 .",
    "the interior matter - density of the holostar is completely fixed .",
    "the holostar s remarkable properties arise from a delicate cancellation of terms in the einstein equations , which only takes place for the `` special '' matter - density @xmath1101 .",
    "how then can the requirement @xmath8 be achieved in the radiation dominated era ?",
    "a complete answer can not be given in this paper .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed discussion . there",
    "it will be shown , that the ultra - relativistic fermions must acquire a non - zero chemical potential in the holostar space - time , which changes the relative contributions to the energy- and entropy - densities of the fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in a way that @xmath1102 is achieved for the total energy- and entropy density .",
    "the required value for the chemical potential depends on the ratio of fermionic to bosonic degrees . in general @xmath1075 can not be expressed in a closed form , but must be found numerically by an implicit function .",
    "however , when the fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom are equal , the formula become very simple .",
    "if every bosonic degree of freedom is paired with a fermionic degree of freedom , as suggested by supersymetry , the non - zero chemical potential of the fermions has the effect to enhance the entropy - density of a fermionic degree of freedom exactly by a factor of 3/2 over a bosonic degree of freedom .",
    "the energy - density is enhanced by a factor of 7/3 .",
    "therefore the entropy - density on the left side of equation ( [ eq : s : total : rho:2 ] ) , which only contains the bosonic contribution ( with zero chemical potential ) has to be replaced by :    @xmath1103    whereas the energy - density has to be replaced by    @xmath1104    so that    @xmath1105    supersymmetry - or rather a ( model - dependent ) non - zero value for the chemical potential of the fermions - has the remarkable effect to modify the fermionic contribution to the energy- and entropy densities with respect to the bosonic contributions in such a way , that the requirement @xmath1094 is met even in the radiation dominated era .",
    "this ensures , that the holostar has an entropy exactly proportional to the hawking entropy , not only for large holostars with @xmath1106 , but for any conceivable size .",
    "one can turn the argument around : hawking s derivation for the black hole entropy / temperature is extremely robust .",
    "the only input is the evolution of a quantum field in the exterior space - time .",
    "the approximations are expected to brake down for planck - sized black holes , but not for black holes with 1 % of the mass of the sun .",
    "viewed from the exterior space - time a holostar has exactly the same gravitational field as a black hole , except for a planck - sized region outside its gravitational radius .",
    "therefore , from the viewpoint of hawking s analysis in the exterior space - time , the holostar should have an entropy exactly equal to the hawking entropy , with the possible exclusion of planck - sized holostars .",
    "but this requires , that supersymmetry ( or at least non - zero chemical potentials of the fermions ) must become important in the _ interior _ space - time , whenever the temperature is high enough , that the interior matter consists predominantly out of radiation .",
    "the holostar is a static solution with a constant gravitating mass @xmath77 .",
    "its entropy has been shown to be proportional to the hawking entropy , i.e. @xmath1107 . for a large holostar the mass and entropy are nearly constant , because the hawking evaporation time @xmath1108 is immensely large . therefore entropy and entropy are conserved globally in the holostar space - time .",
    "is entropy and energy conserved locally as well ? at first sight entropy and energy - conservation",
    "appear to be violated from the local viewpoint of a geodesically moving observer .",
    "for such an observer the volume expands isotropically as @xmath1109 , the total energy - density scales with @xmath47 and the entropy - density with @xmath373 according to equation ( [ eq : s = g ] ) .",
    "as the local observer sees more and more of the holostar space - time ( his hubble - radius increases with @xmath1110 ) , he sees an ever increasing energy @xmath1111 and an increasing entropy @xmath1112 within the observable part of the universe , defined by his local hubble - volume .",
    "both energy and entropy increase by different power laws in @xmath19 .",
    "but @xmath621 and @xmath626 have exactly the dependencies on @xmath19 that are required from local energy / entropy conservation . the important thing to realize",
    "is , that the local observer is not sitting in a closed system .",
    "rather , as the observable part of the universe expands , work is done against the negative pressure and entropy is produced by the ( pressure - induced ) change in energy at a specific well defined temperature .",
    "if the pressure - induced work is taken properly into account we find , that energy is conserved locally : with @xmath1113 and @xmath1114 we find @xmath1115 , so that @xmath1111 , which is exactly the energy dependence that a local observer sees within his hubble - volume .",
    "the same argument applies to the entropy .",
    "if we take the entropy into account that is produced by the increase in energy via the well known relation @xmath1116 , we find for @xmath1111 and @xmath1117 , that @xmath1118 , so that @xmath1119 , exactly as required .",
    "for a detailed discussion , which analyzes the phenomena from the frame of the co - moving and a stationary observer , see section [ sec : frames ] .",
    "therefore we get the remarkable result , that both energy and entropy are conserved globally and locally in the holostar space - time .",
    "whereas energy - conservation should pose no conceptual problem , entropy - conservation seems to be in conflict with the second law of thermodynamics @xmath1120 .",
    "however , this is only an apparent contradiction .",
    "quite clearly the second law allows reversible processes with @xmath1121 .",
    "( or the boltzmann h - theorem ) , although widely accepted as a true law of physics , still has the status of an empirical statement .",
    "all attempts to prove @xmath1122 from first principles have failed .",
    "this is not too surprising , because all microscopic processes are time - reversible .",
    "the holostar solution provides a solution to this puzzle : the holostar solution as a whole is time - reversible and its entropy is constant ( neglecting hawking radiation , which is a very slow process for large holostars ) . yet",
    "the interior matter of the holostar solution `` splits '' into two sectors , the outmoving and inmoving particles .",
    "these sectors become `` separated from each other '' at a very early stage of the motion : the highly relativistic motion of the outmoving with respect to the inmoving particles decreases the cross - sections in a way , that there is virtually no interaction between the two sectors at late times .",
    "the expanding sector corresponds to an increase in entropy , the contracting sector to a decrease .",
    "both sectors are superimposed over each other at every space - time point .",
    "although @xmath1123 is clearly positive in the expanding sector , the contracting sector exactly compensates this change , so that @xmath1121 _ locally ! _ at every space - time point . ] yet the entropy increases for any outward moving observer . not knowing the reason for this increase",
    ", any sensible observer must assume that there is a general law of the form @xmath1124 .",
    "but this is just an _ apparent _ increase in entropy , tied to the observer s state of motion .",
    "an inward moving observer , ignorant of the existence of the outmoving observer , will assume @xmath1125 .",
    "an observer who knows the total picture will conlude that @xmath1121 .    the assumption , that the sign of @xmath1123 might be related to the arrow of time or the expansion of the universe , is not new .",
    "remarkably this more or less intuitive association receives a ( partial ) justification and a quite unexpected resolution : @xmath1126 is in fact related to the expansion , but the statement that @xmath1124 when @xmath1127 is rather a misconception , based on our ignorance of the large scale structure of the universe . if the entropy - production due to the pressure - induced energy increase is taken properly into account , and if one realizes that the energy- and entropy increase in the `` expanding '' sector of the interior space - time is associated with an associated decrease of equal magnitude in the `` contracting '' sector , @xmath1128 not just globally , but also locally !      for a very large holostar of the size of the universe , its outer regions will consist of low - density matter , which should be quite comparable in density and/or distribution to the matter we find in our universe .",
    "such matter can be expected form local hierarchical sub - structures comparable to those found in our universe , as long as the scale of the sub - structures remains compatible with the overall mass - energy distribution @xmath21 of the holostar .    on not too large a scale some local regions might collapse , leaving voids , others might expand , giving rise to filamental structures .",
    "however , any local redistribution of mass - energy has to conserve the total gravitational mass of the holostar , its total angular momentum and - quite likely - its entropy , i.e. its total number of particles .",
    "these exterior constraints require that regions of high matter - density must be accompanied by voids .",
    "furthermore one can expect , that the local distribution of matter within a holostar will exhibit some sort of self - similarity , i.e. the partly collapsed regions should follow the global @xmath47-law for the local mass - density .",
    "this expected behavior is quite in agreement with the observations concerning the mass - distribution in our universe : the flat rotation curves of galaxies , as well as the velocity dispersion in galaxies and clusters of galaxies hint strongly , that the matter distribution of the local matter in galaxies and clusters follows an @xmath47-law .",
    "as far as i know , there has been no truly convincing explanation for this apparently universal scaling law , so far .    in newtonian gravity",
    "a local matter - distribution proportional to @xmath47 can be described by the so called isothermal sphere ( see for instance @xcite ) , whose spherically symmetric matter - distribution is given by :    @xmath1129    @xmath1130 is the constant velocity - dispersion of the objects within the sphere , which is interpreted as `` temperature '' ( thus the term isothermal ) .",
    "it appears , that for @xmath1131 the isothermal sphere is a useful approximation for the relation between the matter - density and the velocity dispersion of certain galaxies .",
    "clearly the newtonian approach will fail for relativistic velocity - dispersions .",
    "quite interestingly , the matter - distribution of the holographic solution can be - formally - described by @xmath1132 , indicating that the newtonian approach can not be expected to be a reliable approximation for @xmath1133 .",
    "most of the discussion about the properties of the holostar has been in the frame of the asymptotic observer , who is at rest in the ( @xmath505)-coordinate system .",
    "if the holostar is to serve as a model for an expanding universe , one must interpret the phenomena from the frame of the co - moving observer , who moves nearly geodesically on an almost radial trajectory through the low density outer regions of the holostar .",
    "the frames of the co - moving and the asymptotic observer are related by a lorentz boost in the radial direction . due to the small tidal acceleration in the holostar s outer regions ,",
    "the extension of the local lorentz frames can be fairly large .",
    "the proper acceleration - due to exterior forces , such as the pressure - experienced by the co - moving observer will be very low in the regions which have a density comparable to the density that is observed in the universe at the present time .",
    "the holostar s interior space - time is boost - invariant in the radial direction , i.e. the stress - energy tensor is unaffected by a radial boost .",
    "the co - moving observer moves nearly radially for @xmath1134 .",
    "his radial @xmath10-factor grows as the square root of his radial coordinate value , whereas his tangential velocity goes rapidly to zero with @xmath373 .",
    "the radially boosted co - moving observer therefore will see exactly the same total stress - energy tensor - and thus the same total energy density and total principal pressures - as the observer at rest in the ( @xmath1135)-coordinate system .",
    "the above statement , however , only refers to the total energy density and pressures .",
    "it is not a priori clear if the individual contributions to the mass - energy and pressures , for example from massive particles and photons , have the same @xmath19-dependence as the total energy density .",
    "let us first consider the case of massive particles .",
    "the observer at rest in the coordinate system measures an energy density @xmath16 of the massive particles , which is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "a factor of @xmath578 comes from the number density given in equation ( [ eq : n : massive ] ) , a factor of @xmath565 from the special relativistic @xmath10-factor that must be applied to the rest mass of the particles according to equation ( [ eq : e(r):massive ] ) .    from a naive perspective ( neglecting the effects of the pressure )",
    "it appears as if the co - moving observer and the observer at rest in the ( @xmath505)-coordinate system disagree on how the energy and number densities of massive particles develop with @xmath19 . because of the highly relativistic motion of the co - moving observer , the observer at rest in the ( @xmath560)-coordinate system will find that the proper volume of any observer co - moving with the massive particles is lorentz - contracted in the radial direction .",
    "therefore the co - moving observer will measure a larger proper volume , enlarged by the radial @xmath10-factor , which is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "if we denote the volume in the frame of the co - moving observer by an overline , we find @xmath1136 . as long as the massive particles are nt created or destroyed ,",
    "the number - density of the massive particles in the co - moving frame therefore must scale as @xmath590 .",
    "furthermore , for the co - moving observer the neighboring massive particles are at rest to a very good approximation .. ] therefore the mass - energy density in the co - moving frame should be nothing else than the ( presumably ) constant rest - mass of the particles multiplied by their number - density . from this",
    "it follows , that the mass - energy density of the massive particles should scale as @xmath590 as well .",
    "this naive conclusion , however , is false",
    ". it does not take into account the energy change in the co - moving volume due to the radial pressure .",
    "any radial expansion in the co - moving frame affects the internal energy . due to lorentz - elongation in the co - moving volume the radial thickness @xmath1137 of the expanding shell develops proportional to @xmath19 in the co - moving frame . from this the internal energy - change @xmath1138 in the shell can be calculated for a small radial displacement @xmath1139 .",
    "we find :    @xmath1140    with @xmath1141 and @xmath1142 .",
    "note that the radial pressure in the co - moving frame is exactly equal to the radial pressure in the coordinate frame due to the boost - invariance of the stress - energy tensor in the radial direction .    from equation ( [ eq : de : massive : co ] )",
    "the radial dependence of the internal total energy in the co - moving frame follows :    @xmath1143    we have already seen that the co - moving volume develops as @xmath1144 , so that the energy density of the massive particles in the co - moving frame , taking the pressure into account , develops exactly as in the coordinate frame , i.e. @xmath1145 .",
    "it is quite obvious that such a dependence is not compatible with the assumption that both the rest - mass and the number of the massive particles in the co - moving volume remain constant .",
    "either the rest - mass of the massive particles must increase during the expansion or new particles ( massive or radiation ) have to be created by the negative pressure .",
    "there is no strong experimental evidence , that the rest mass of the nucleon or the electron have changed considerably during the evolution of the universe , at least in last few billon years .",
    "if this is the case we can not avoid the conclusion that the negative pressure has the effect to create new particles in the co - moving frame .",
    "particle creation in an expanding universe is not new .",
    "it is one of the basic assumptions of the steady - state model .",
    "furthermore particle production via expansion against a negative pressure is a well known phenomenon from the inflational equation of state .",
    "there are differences .",
    "whereas the isotropic negative pressure of the inflational phase keeps the energy - density in the expanding universe constant during the expansion , the energy - density in the holostar develops as @xmath47 , because the negative string type pressure only acts in one of three spatial directions . as a result",
    "the particle creation rate in the holostar is quite low at the present time : roughly one neutron per cubic kilometer every 10 years is required .",
    "note , that we have assumed that the massive particles move geodesically in this argument .",
    "the non - negligible pressure within the holostar solution might enforce non - geodesic motion .",
    "( this is quite unlikely for large @xmath19 , according to the discussion in section [ sec : massive : acc ] . )",
    "would this change the main results found above , i.e. @xmath21 in both the co - moving and the coordinate frame ?",
    "the answer is no , as can be seen by analyzing the following hypothetical case of non - geodesic motion .",
    "let us assume that the motion of massive particles takes place in such a way , that there is no expansion in the radial direction .",
    "if energy - conservation holds globally , it can be shown that in this case the radial motion is subject to a nearly constant proper velocity , as viewed by the observer at rest in the coordinate frame , meaning that the radial @xmath749-factor is constant .",
    "the observers in both frames do nt see any pressure - induced particle production , because there is no expansion against the radial pressure .",
    "furthermore , in both frames the energy- and number - densities follow an inverse square law , as the expansion only takes place in the two tangential directions and both observers do nt see any @xmath19-dependent lorentz - contraction due to the constant @xmath749 factor .",
    "this mode of non - geodesic motion for the massive particles has the following interesting feature : pure geodesic motion of massive particles leads to the somewhat undesirable result , that there would be a non - zero - albeit quite small - mass - energy density outside the membrane , which is nt compatible with the holostar equations ( one might try to modify the equations , though ) .",
    "geodesic motion is characterized by large values of @xmath10 .",
    "it can be shown , that for the @xmath10-values in question the massive particle will move out as far as @xmath1146 , i.e. to the angular momentum barrier of the photons , before they reverse their motion .",
    "in contrast , low @xmath749 particles will reverse their motion at a position less that a planck length outside the membrane , thus smearing the membrane out over roughly a planck length , which is quite what one would expect from a quantum perspective . ]",
    "the above analysis indicates that , independent whether the motion is geodesic or not , the energy density of the massive particles in the co - moving frame should be proportional to @xmath47 , exactly as in the coordinate frame .",
    "the conclusion is , that a radial boost from the coordinate to the co - moving frame not only leaves the total energy density unaffected , but also the respective energy densities of the different particle species . with the assumption that the rest mass of the massive particles is constant the number densities must also evolve according to @xmath47 .",
    "one can see this already from the holostar s interior energy - density :    @xmath1147    the above equation is nearly exact , when the matter - content of the universe is dominated by one single massive species ( the nucleon ) .",
    "let us now discuss the number- and energy densities of the zero rest - mass particles in the two frames .",
    "this problem is closely related to the question whether the co - moving observer experiences a different radiation temperature than the observer at rest in the ( @xmath505)-coordinate system .",
    "the standard argument for the red - shift of radiation in an expanding robertson - walker universe is , that the wavelength of the radiation is stretched proportional to the expansion .",
    "this argument also gives the @xmath1148 dependence in the standard cosmological models .",
    "] this gives the known @xmath839-dependence for the radiation temperature in the standard cosmological models .",
    "if this argument is applied to the holostar , one naively expects that the @xmath1149-law ( which has been shown to hold in the coordinate frame ) is transformed to a @xmath1150-law in the frame of the co - moving observer , due to lorentz - contraction ( or rather elongation ) of the photon wavelength .",
    "but a @xmath1151-law would nt be consistent for a small holostar , where - due to the high temperature - the energy density is expected to be dominated by radiation in true thermal equilibrium .",
    "the energy density of thermalized radiation is proportional to @xmath364 .",
    "if the only contributor to the total energy density is radiation , the radiation energy density will transform exactly as the total energy density in a radial boost .",
    "however , the total energy density is radially boost - invariant .",
    "therefore in the radiation dominated era the energy density of the radiation in any radially boosted frame should scale as @xmath47 .",
    "this however implies the @xmath1152-dependence , at least if the radiation is in thermal equilibrium in the boosted frame . trivially . ]    in a radially boost - invariant space - time one would expect on more general grounds , that it is - in principle - impossible to determine the radial velocity of the motion , at least by direct measurements performed by the observer co - moving with the matter - flow .",
    "a @xmath1151-law would imply a radiation temperature incompatible with the energy - density of the radiation , which would allow the co - moving observer to determine his radial velocity .",
    "this can be seen as follows :    according to equation ( [ eq : numberdensity ] ) the number density of photons in the coordinate frame scales as @xmath1153 .",
    "naively one would assume , that the number - density of photons in the co - moving frame is given by @xmath1154 , due to lorentz elongation of the co - moving volume with respect to the observer at rest .",
    "however , at a closer look one has to take into account the measurement process .",
    "photons can not be counted just by putting them in a box and then taking out each individual particle .",
    "as photons always move with the local speed of light , such a procedure , which would be good for massive particles , does nt work .",
    "the right way to count photons is to place a small ideal ( spherical ) absorber somewhere in the space - time , count all the hits per proper time interval and relate the obtained number to the volume ( or surface area ) of the absorber . but",
    "this procedure requires , that the time - delay due to the highly relativistic motion of the co - moving observer has to be taken into account .",
    "the co - moving observer will count many more photons in a given standard interval of his proper time , than the observer at rest would count in the same interval .",
    "the time - dilation introduces another @xmath10-factor that exactly cancels the @xmath10-factor from the lorentz contraction of the proper volume",
    ". therefore we arrive at the remarkable result , that the number - density of photons should be the same for both observers , i.e. independent of a radial boost .. assuming that the photon number in the shell remains constant in the co - moving frame ( which is equivalent to assuming geodesic motion or a thermal spectrum ) we then find @xmath1155 . ]",
    "if we had @xmath1151 in the co - moving frame , we would get @xmath1156 , which implies @xmath1157 in the co - moving frame . however , in thermal equilibrium @xmath1158 . even if the argument given above for the number - density of photons were incorrect , i.e. only the volume were lorentz contracted and time dilation would play no role , we would have @xmath1159 , implying @xmath1160 in the co - moving frame , which would nt work either .    therefore it seems reasonable to postulate , that a radial boost from the @xmath397-coordinate system to the system of the co - moving observer should not only leave the total energy density unaffected , but also other physically important characteristics such as the thermodynamic state of the system , i.e. whether or not the radiation can be characterized as thermal .",
    "this then implies that the thermodynamic relation between energy - density and temperature for an ultra - relativistic gas should be valid in the radially boosted frame of the co - moving observer , i.e. @xmath1161 , which requires the @xmath1152 law .",
    "the reader may object , that any radial boost will produce a large anisotropy in the radiation temperature , as measured in the boosted frame .",
    "i.e. the radiation will be blue - shifted for photons travelling opposite to the motion of the co - moving observer and red - shifted for photons travelling in the same direction , due to `` normal '' doppler shift .",
    "however , this point of view implicitly assumes , that the radiation has originated from matter _ at rest _ in the coordinate system . if the radiation that the observer in the co - moving frame sees has originated from the massive particles in his _ own _ frame . ]",
    ", the radiation will be nearly isotropic : the observer in the co - moving frame experiences an isotropic hubble - expansion of the massive particles within the current hubble - radius .",
    "ignoring tidal effects ( which are second order ) and assuming that special relativity remains correct even for @xmath10-factors as high as occur in the holostar space - time , it does not matter whether the isotropically expanding volume is at rest or moves relative to a - preferred or not preferred boosted frame - with extremely high @xmath10-factors .    if the radiation is isotropic in the co - moving frame , one might assume , that it is highly anisotropic in the coordinate frame .",
    "but it is quite unlikely that a - hypothetical - observer in the coordinate frame will be able to see the radiation that has originated in the co - moving frame : this radiation has an energy roughly equal to the planck - energy and thus an extremely low cross - sectional area .",
    "what the observer at rest in the coordinate frame will see , however , is unruh radiation associated with the pressure - induced acceleration . it will be shown in section [ sec : unruh ] that the unruh - temperature associated with this acceleration scales with @xmath362 , just as required .",
    "unruh - radiation is always isotropic . if this is the correct interpretation , the only type of radiation that an observer in the coordinate frame can see - effectively - is unruh radiation with a temperature proportional to the radiation temperature in the co - moving frame .",
    "self - consistency requires , that both temperatures are equal .    another - not too convincing argument - for the isotropy of the radiation in the co - moving frame",
    "can be devised , if one takes the negative radial pressure into account .",
    "the radially boosted observer will find that the volume that lies in front of him is lorentz - contracted in the radial direction .",
    "the photons coming from the front side therefore come from a radially `` squeezed '' volume .",
    "but any volume contraction in the radial direction will reduce the energy of the photons because of the negative radial pressure .",
    "the blue - shift of the photons due to the ( kinematical ) doppler - shift will be exactly compensated by the red - shift originating from the pressure - induced lorentz contraction .",
    "a similar effect occurs for the photons coming from the rear , i.e. moving in the same direction as the observer .",
    "although perhaps some new insights are required in order to resolve the problem of relating the observations in the different frames in a satisfactory fashion , nature appears to have taken a definite point of view : if we live in a large holostar , we clearly are in the position of the co - moving observer . except for a small dipole anisotropy , which can be explained by the small relative motion of our local group with respect to the isotropic hubble - flow ( or by tidal effects ) ,",
    "the cmbr is isotropic .",
    "furthermore , in planck - units the cmbr - temperature is @xmath1162 , whereas the radius of the observable universe is roughly @xmath1163 and the mass - density @xmath1164 .",
    "these simple figures strongly suggest , that the @xmath1165 and @xmath27 laws are realized in our universe in the system of the co - moving observer .",
    "the discussion of the previous section has paved the way to address the problem of nucleosynthesis in the holostar universe .",
    "a quite remarkable by - product of the discussion in this section is a surprisingly simple explanation for the baryon to photon ratio in the universe .      in the following discussion",
    "i will assume , that the rest - mass of the electron and nucleon are constant , i.e. independent of temperature or radial position .",
    "this assumption will be relaxed in the subsequent section .",

    "whenever we know what the ratio of the energy densities should be , we can estimate the present value of @xmath1180 .",
    "can the ratio between the energy densities of photons and electrons in the holostar universe be predicted by first principles ? in order to answer this question",

    "even when the reactions that have maintained thermal equilibrium before have ceased , the energy - densities of the two particles species will be maintained at a nearly constant ratio , whose exact value is determined by the physics at the time - period where electrons and photons have decoupled chemically .. ] an exact determination of this ratio is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "quite likely chemical potentials will play an important role ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is quite encouraging that the very rough estimate @xmath1184 at the time of chemical decoupling is within a factor of three of the experimental value @xmath1185 determined at the present time .",
    "in fact , @xmath1186 is the theoretical prediction for the ratio of the energy - densities of electrons to photons at high temperatures in thermal equilibrium in the holostar space - time , when the non - zero chemical potential of the electrons is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the discussion above allows us to make a rough estimate for the value of @xmath1180 at the present time . assuming that photons and electrons decoupled chemically at @xmath1187 and assuming equal energy - densities of electrons and photons at this time we find :    @xmath1188    this very rough estimate is only a factor of 2 higher than the wmap - result @xmath1189 .",
    "we can also compare the value in equation ( [ eq : eta ] ) to the maximum possible value of the baryon to photon ratio in the universe today . under the assumption that there is no significant dark matter - component @xmath1190",
    "can be estimated from the cosmological number densities of photons and electrons .",
    "we find @xmath1191 , which is a factor of two higher than the estimate of equation ( [ eq : eta ] ) .",
    "we are now in the position to discuss nucleosynthesis in the holostar universe .",
    "the primordial synthesis of the light elements proceeds somewhat differently as in the standard cosmological model .",
    "the two key parameters governing the respective reaction rates , the number density of the nucleons ( baryons ) @xmath976 at the temperature of nucleosynthesis and the ( hubble ) expansion rate , turn out to be significantly different in both models .    in the standard cosmological model the number - density of the nucleons depends on the cube of the temperature , i.e. @xmath1192 , whereas according to the discussion above the co - moving observer in the holostar finds that the number density of non - relativistic particles scales as the fourth power of the temperature , @xmath1193 .",
    "therefore the number - density of the nucleons at the temperature of nucleosynthesis will be roughly nine orders of magnitude higher than in the standard model .",
    "this wo nt have a large effect on the ratio of primordial helium-4 to hydrogen .",
    "the numerical value of the he / h ratio is mainly due to the n / p ratio in thermal equilibrium at @xmath1194 , i.e. the temperature where the weak reactions are shut off .",
    ", i.e. the temperature where deuterons are produced in significant numbers ( and quickly end up in the more stable @xmath1195 ) , also plays a non - negligible role in the standard cosmological model .",
    "note that the shut - off temperature of the weak interactions , which is @xmath1196 in the standard model , depends on the hubble rate , and thus will be ( slightly ) different in the holostar .",
    "] however , the higher number - density will have a considerable effect on the amount of deuterium , helium-3 and lithium-7 produced in the first few seconds of the universe .",
    "the relative abundance of these elements depends quite sensitively on the nuclear reaction rates , which are proportional to the number - densities of the reacting species . in order to accurately calculate the relative number densities of all the other elements , excluding h and he-4",
    ", one has to consider the dynamic process in which the nuclear reactions compete against the cosmic expansion .",
    "eventually the nuclear reaction rates will fall below the expansion rate , ending the period of nucleosynthesis .",
    "therefore the second key parameter in primordial nucleosynthesis , besides the nucleon number - densities , is the cosmic expansion rate , which is proportional to the hubble - value .    in the matter dominated era the standard model predicts @xmath1197 , whereas in the radiation dominated era @xmath1198 . in the radiation dominated era",
    "the dependence of the expansion rate on the temperature is equal in both models . taking the different dependencies in the matter - dominated era into account",
    ", one can relate the hubble - constant @xmath1199 in the holostar universe and the hubble - constant @xmath1032 in the standard model at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "we find :    @xmath1200    where @xmath1201 is the red - shift at which the standard model becomes radiation dominated , according to the recent wmap findings .",
    "the above result is quite consistent with the fact , that the `` age '' of the universe at @xmath1202 is roughly @xmath1203 in the holostar , whereas in the standard cosmological model we find @xmath1204 at the same temperature .",
    "it should be evident , that due to the differences in the two key parameters nucleosynthesis in the holostar universe will proceed quite differently from the standard model . without actually solving the rate equations it is difficult to make quantitative predictions .",
    "in general the higher number density of nucleons in the holostar will lead to a more effective conversion of deuterons to the stable helium-4 nucleus , reducing the relative abundance of the few deuterium nuclei that survive their conversion to he-4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the significantly larger expansion rate enhances the chance , that the less stable nuclei such as deuterium and he-3 will survive through the much shorter time period of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "the nuclear reactions are shut - off faster , providing some amount of `` compensation '' for the faster reaction rates due to the higher number densities .",
    "yet it would be quite a coincidence , if nucleosynthesis in the holostar would lead to the same abundances of deuterium , helium-3 and lithium-7 as in the standard cosmological model .",
    "whether the holostar model of the universe can explain the experimentally determined abundances of the light elements in a satisfactory fashion , therefore must be considered as an open question .",
    "it might turn out that more radical proposals are required to make the holostar solution compatible with the observational results , such as the relative abundances of the light elements .    in this section",
    "i will explore the possibility , that the rest - mass of the massive particles might vary with radial distance parameter @xmath19 ( or equivalently , with temperature , mean energy , curvature radius etc . ) in the holostar solution .",
    "although there is not much conclusive observational evidence for such a variation , the dualities of string theory suggest the possibility of a power - law relation between mass- and the distance scales .",
    "some implications of such a variation in the context of an frw - model have been discussed @xcite .",
    "therefore let us assume that    @xmath1205    both the nucleon and the electron have masses lying in the range between @xmath1206 and @xmath1207 of the planck mass .",
    "the current radius of the universe is @xmath23 in units of the planck length .",

    "the cross sections of the elementary particles are roughly proportional to @xmath1213 .",
    "all in all we find that the ratio of cross - sectional area of a particle with respect to its mass @xmath404 , which already turned out to be an important quantity in section [ sec : massive : acc ] , is roughly equal to the current radius of the universe and inverse proportional to the cube of the particle mass in planck units , i.e. @xmath1214 .",
    "furthermore , an assumed variation @xmath1215 is sufficiently small , so that it might have gone unnoticed .    under the assumption of a matter - dominated universe the number - density of the massive particles",

    "this factor is roughly 5000 , assuming @xmath1219 according to wmap .",
    "the ratio of the number - densities is given by :    @xmath1220    note , that this relation is _ independent _ of the functional dependence of @xmath602 .",

    "it is easy to calculate the energy at which this happens , by recalling that :    @xmath1222    so that    @xmath1223    in the matter - dominated era the temperature depends on the cube of the ratio @xmath1224 .",
    "this ratio is quite low at the present time . with @xmath1225 and using equation ( [ eq : m : m / t ] ) we can extrapolate the radiation temperature from today s value up to the time when the ratio @xmath1226 is unity .",

    "a temperature of @xmath1229 corresponds to a mean particle energy @xmath1230 , which is quite close to the @xmath1231-energy .",
    "therefore the assumption of an @xmath19-dependent mass with @xmath1232 leads to the quite spectacular scenario , that the unification energy - scale turns out to be nothing else than the scale at which the electron becomes relativistic in the thermal environment of the holostar space - time .",

    "if we except that the ratio @xmath664 is the truly relevant quantity to which the local length scale @xmath1241 must be referenced , the number - densities of the particles expressed in terms of @xmath1242 evolve as if the `` full '' underlying space - time consisted out of 9 ( or 10 ) spatial dimensions : the number - density of the _ massless _ particles evolves as @xmath1243 , whereas the number - density of the _ massive _ particles evolves as @xmath1244 .",

    "there are only two conceivable positions in the holostar , where a particle can remain at rest : the membrane , which constitutes the global minimum of the effective potential , and the central position @xmath444 , where the effective potential has a local maximum .",
    "let us first discuss unruh - radiation at the membrane .",
    "as the membrane constitutes the boundary to the exterior space - time , we have to consider the geodesic acceleration induced by the exterior space - time in addition to the geodesic acceleration in the interior . except for a planck size black hole",
    "the exterior geodesic acceleration is much larger than the interior acceleration ( at the position at the membrane ) , so that the unruh - temperature at the membrane will be dominated by unruh - radiation tied to the exterior acceleration .",
    "the exterior geodesic acceleration is nothing else than that of a black hole outside of the event - horizon :    @xmath1261    which amounts to    @xmath1262    at the position of the membrane @xmath108 .",

    "in anticipation of the result , i denote this position by @xmath176 . at @xmath176 self - consistency",
    "requires , that the unruh - temperature should be equal to the radiation temperature .",
    "it does not make sense to attribute two different temperatures to the same physical situation .",
    "the difficult question is how to properly define this `` rest '' position .",
    "the concept of point - like particles does nt make sense in the holostar space - time , so that @xmath194 is meaningless . such an exact value would also be in conflict with the uncertainty principle . in section [ sec : uncertainty ]",
    "is has been shown , that the uncertainty principle forbids that any particle in the holostar space - time can be localized better than @xmath444 .",
    "furthermore , the smallest possible `` radius '' of a particle is @xmath950 ( see the discussion in section [ sec : uncertainty ] ) .",
    "according to the arguments given in section [ sec : energy : conditions ] the `` region '' @xmath1267 should not be considered to be a genuine part of the space - time , so that the smallest `` distance '' of any real particle from the center is @xmath461 . from this perspective one expects , that the central `` rest '' position in the holostar space - time should be the position closest to the center that can be occupied by one single ( real ) particle , leading to @xmath225 .",
    "a better definition explicitly takes into account that the unruh- and radiation temperature must be equal at the radial position where a ( real ) particle / observer is _ at rest_. as the equilibrium at the center is unstable , any particle / observer nearly at rest at the center must eventually start to move out . at late times",
    "the particle s motion will be nearly geodesical .",
    "as geodesic motion at late times is nearly radial , the equations of geodesic motion are governed by just one parameter , @xmath176 , which is defined as the radial position , where the motion started out from rest .- factor of the motion via equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , the locally measured hubble - constant via equation ( [ eq : hubble ] ) etc . ]",
    "therefore it makes imminent sense to identify the `` rest '' position , where unruh and radiation temperature are equal , with @xmath176 . with this identification equation ( [ eq : tunruh ] )",
    "immediately allows us to make the prediction :    @xmath1268      so far we only analyzed the unruh temperature for an observer at rest in the coordinate system .",

    "the answer is trivial : a geodesically moving observer is by definition unaccelerated in his own frame of reference , so such an observer will not experience an unruh temperature .",
    "however , pure geodesic motion is not possible within a holostar , due to the pressure . even in the low - density regions of a holostar where the motion can be considered by all practical purposes to be geodesic",
    ", the pressure provides a small deceleration .",
    "it is quite easy to calculate this deceleration in the co - moving frame .",

    "even when the cross - sectional area @xmath403 is taken to be equal to the electro - magnetic cross section of an electron , @xmath1273 , we find that the pressure - induced deceleration in the frame of the co - moving observer is of the order @xmath1274 .",
    "furthermore , in order to attain an unruh - temperature comparable to the temperature of the cmbr , the proper acceleration in the co - moving frame would have to be enormous : @xmath1275 for @xmath1276 .",
    "therefore unruh radiation does not play any significant role for the co - moving observer ( except at @xmath1277 ) .",
    "let us now turn back to a stationary observer , i.e. an observer at rest in the coordinate system .",
    "this observer is subject to two different sources of acceleration : the geodesic acceleration and the pressure - induced acceleration .",
    "the _ geodesic _ acceleration falls off with @xmath373 , so that the unruh - temperature due to the geodesic acceleration is negligible with respect to the radiation temperature .",
    "however , for an observer at rest in the holostar space - time the unruh - temperature induced by the pressure is not negligible .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath4 , i.e. proportional to the radiation temperature . in order to see this ,",
    "let us go back to the co - moving moving observer , who moves highly relativistically with respect to a stationary observer on a nearly geodesic path .",
    "although the co - moving observer can not move exactly geodesically with zero proper acceleration , due to the pressure , he is singled out from other reference frames by the requirement , that the pressure - induced acceleration will be smallest in his frame . in order to calculate the pressure - induced acceleration in any other frame , such as the frame of the stationary observer",
    ", we only have to transform the proper acceleration measured by the co - moving observer to the other frame .",
    "this is an easy exercise in special relativity .",
    "if we denote the pressure - induced acceleration in the stationary frame with a tilde , we get @xmath1278 , because the deceleration @xmath400 lies in the direction of motion , i.e. is parallel to the ( radial ) boost .",
    "@xmath10 is given by equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "therefore the acceleration ( or rather deceleration ) due to the pressure in the frame of the _ stationary _ observer turns out as :    @xmath1279    this acceleration can be associated with an unruh temperature , which the stationary observer should be able to measure in principle .",
    "@xmath1280    we find that the pressure - induced unruh - temperature in the frame of the stationary observer is proportional to the local radiation temperature @xmath947 , and therefore much higher than the unruh - temperature produced by geodesic acceleration as given in equation ( [ eq : tunruh ] ) .    in the above equation we have taken @xmath176 to be arbitrary .",
    "this will allow us to determine @xmath176 from a slightly different perspective .",
    "for @xmath257 the unruh - temperature in the stationary frame would be much lower than the radiation temperature experienced by the co - moving observer .",
    "the ratio of the unruh - temperature to the local radiation temperature is nearly constant and given by :    @xmath1281    @xmath1282 is the local radiation temperature at the turning point of the motion of the geodesically moving observer .",
    "it seems paradoxical , that the unruh - temperature of the stationary observer should depend on the - presumably arbitrary - position @xmath176 , from which a geodesically moving observer started out his motion .",
    "the solution to this apparent paradox is , that there is only one possible position @xmath1283 in the holostar space - time , where a real observer can start his motion from rest .",
    "it is possible to determine the value of @xmath176 from equation ( [ eq : tu / t ] ) .",
    "again it does not make sense to attribute different temperatures to an observer at rest at @xmath176 .",
    "setting the unruh temperature and the radiation temperature at @xmath176 equal we get    @xmath1284    the last equality follows from the discussion in [ sec : massive : acc ] and the results obtained in @xcite , according to which @xmath1285 , so that we get the already known result @xmath1286 .",
    "note that this argument is independent of the argument leading to equation ( [ eq : ri = r0 ] ) .",

    "any one who has ever set his feet on the earth knows , that being stationary in a static gravitational field does not mean that one does not feel its effects .",
    "therefore zero net - acceleration should not confuse us to assume , that the unruh - temperature will be zero . ]    on the other hand , we already know that @xmath1287 , so we can use equation ( [ eq : sigma : m ] ) to obtain an estimate for the mass @xmath46 of a geodesically moving particle starting out from @xmath176 :    @xmath1288    where    @xmath1289    is the temperature at @xmath458 .",

    "naively one would assume , that a stationary observer , situated at the holostar s center , should be able to `` see '' the whole holostar universe from his `` elevated '' position , at least in principle .",
    "on the other hand , we know from section [ sec : hubble ] that a geodesically moving observer , starting out from the center , will experience an isotropic hubble - expansion at late times with @xmath1296 . as a geodesically moving observer can not look beyond his local hubble - length , it is reasonable to assume that the local hubble - constant defines a `` true '' horizon with @xmath1297 .",

    "a discussion which focusses predominantly on the the string - nature of the interior matter can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is not the purpose of this paper , to reiterate results which have been published elsewhere .",
    "however , in light of a recently published result in string theory , which has gained some considerable coverage in the media , i feel obliged to point out how these results , derived purely in the context of string - theory , relate to the properties of the - purely classical - holostar solution .    in @xcite it has been shown ,",
    "that by so called `` fractionation '' the string tension will become inverse proportional to the string length , which leads to the prediction , that the strings can occupy a fairly large volume and `` black holes '' should be filled with low - energy strings .",
    "the radius of such a stringy `` fuzzball '' has been estimated in the context of string theory .",
    "it turned out to be nearly equal to the schwarzschild radius of a black hole .",
    "this result is essentially identical to the predictions that can be obtained from the classical holostar solution .",
    "the string - tension at the radial coordinate position of the membrane @xmath108 is given by    @xmath1311    assuming the string extends from the holostar s center to the membrane , its `` length '' @xmath1312 , determined as the travel time of a photon along the string length measured by an asymptotic observer at infinity , is given by :    @xmath1313    we immediately see that the string tension is inverse proportional to its length .",
    "the constant of proportionality is    @xmath1314    if one takes into account , that not all strings attached to the membrane extend to the holostar s center one can calculate a mean string - length , which is a factor of 2 smaller than the maximum length :    @xmath1315    however , one has to take into account that according to string theory the strings can not just `` end '' in the interior holostar space - time .",
    "either they must form a closed loop , or both string - ends must attach to a d - brane .",
    "the only d - brane in the classical holostar solution is the boundary membrane at @xmath494 .",
    "disregarding any closed ( interior ) loops , any string with one end attached to the holostar s boundary membrane must have its other end attached to the membrane as well .",
    "this doubles the mean length of the string , so that equation ( [ eq : r : mu ] ) should still be the correct result .",
    "as has been demonstrated in the previous chapter , the holostar has properties which are in many respects similar to the properties of black holes and the universe .",
    "it is quite remarkable , that the fairly simple model of the holostar appears to have the potential to explain the properties of objects , that so far have been treated as distinct building blocks of nature .",
    "black holes and the universe did nt appear to have much in common , although both are believed to be self - gravitating systems .",
    "the holostar solution points at a deeper connection between self gravitating systems of any size .",
    "the holostar solution might even be of some relevance for elementary particles .",
    "this chapter is dedicated to a first preliminary discussion of the question , whether the holostar might be able to serve as an alternative - possibly unified - description for black holes , the universe and elementary particles , at a semi - classical level .",
    "the holostar s properties are very similar to the properties attributed to black holes .",
    "it has an entropy and temperature proportional , if not equal to the hawking entropy and temperature .",
    "its exterior space - time metric is equal to that of a black hole , disregarding the planck coordinate distance between the membrane and the gravitational radius .",
    "therefore , as viewed from an exterior observer , the holostar is virtually indistinguishable from a black hole .    with respect to the interior space - time , i.e. the space - time within the event horizon ( or within the membrane )",
    ", there are profound differences :    a black hole has no interior matter , except - presumably - a point mass @xmath77 at the position of its central singularity .",
    "the number and the nature of the interior particles of a black hole , or rather the particles that have gone into the black hole , is undefined .",
    "any concentric sphere within the event horizon is a trapped surface .",
    "the holostar has a continuous interior matter distribution , no singularity at its center , no trapped surfaces and - as will be shown in @xcite - a definite number of interior particles proportional to its boundary area .",
    "the absence of trapped surfaces and of an accompanying singularity is a desirable feature in its own right .",
    "furthermore , the holostar appears to be the most radical fulfillment of the holographic principle : the number of the holostar s interior particles is exactly proportional to its proper surface area .",
    "many researchers believe the holographic principle to be one of the basic ingredients from which a possible future universal theory of quantum gravitation can be formed .",
    "a black hole has an event horizon .",
    "the unique properties of the event horizon , i.e. its constant surface gravity and its ( classically ) non - decreasing area , determine the thermodynamic properties of a black hole , i.e. its hawking temperature and entropy .",
    "the holostar s thermodynamic properties are determined by its interior matter configuration .",
    "therefore the holostar solution `` needs '' no event horizon .",
    "in fact , it possesses no event horizon , because the metric coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath1316 never become zero in the whole space - time .",
    "note , however , that for a large holostar the minimum value of @xmath56 , the metric coefficient with respect to the exterior time coordinate @xmath200 , becomes arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "@xmath56 reaches it s lowest value at the boundary @xmath75 :    @xmath1317    for a holostar with a gravitational radius of @xmath371 planck lengths , i.e. @xmath1318 , one gets @xmath1319 and @xmath1320 .",
    "a holostar with the mass of the sun has @xmath1321 and therefore @xmath1322 .    instead of an event horizon",
    "the holostar possesses a two dimensional membrane of tangential pressure , who s properties are exactly equal to the properties of the event horizon of a black hole as expressed by the membrane paradigm @xcite .",
    "therefore the action of the holostar on the exterior space - time is indistinguishable from that of a same - sized black hole .",
    "the absence of an event horizon is a desirable feature of the holostar .",
    "if there is no event horizon , there is no information paradox .",
    "unitary evolution of states is possible throughout the whole space - time .    from the viewpoint of an exterior observer",

    "it is in most respects similar to a black hole but does nt appear to be plagued with the undesirable consequences of an event horizon ( information paradox ) and of a central singularity ( breakdown of causality and/or predictability ) .",
    "furthermore the holostar s interior is truly machian .",
    "what matters are the relative positions and motions of the interior particles with respect to the whole object .",
    "the holostar s spherical membrane serves as the common reference for all events , not the ill - defined notion of empty asymptotic minkowski space .",
    "in fact , the active gravitational mass - density in the holostar space - time is non - zero only at the membrane , so that the membrane can be regarded as the `` true '' source of the holostar s gravitational field .",
    "both the holostar and a black hole are genuine solutions to the field equation of general relativity . from the viewpoint of the theory",
    "both solutions have a good chance to be physically realized in the real world . at the time",
    "this paper is written the holostar solution looks like an attractive alternative to the black hole solutions .",
    "however , only future research - theoretical and experimental - will be able to answer the question , what alternative , if any , will provide a better description of the phenomena of the real world .",
    "some more evidence in favor of the holostar solution will be presented in @xcite .",
    "a large holostar has some of the properties , which can be found in the universe in its actual state today : at any interior position there is an isotropic radiation background with a definite temperature proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "geodesic motion of photons preserves the planck - distribution .",
    "massive particles acquire a radially directed outward motion , during which the matter - density decreases over proper time .",
    "likewise the temperature of the background radiation decreases .",
    "the temperature and mass density within the holostar are related by the following formula , @xmath1323 , which yields results consistent with the observations , when the mass density and microwave - background temperature of the universe are used as input and @xmath12 is set to roughly twice the planck - length .",
    "the theoretical description of the universe s evolution - according to the equations of motion in the holostar space - time - is in many aspects similar to the standard cosmological model . in the standard model",
    "the energy density is related to the cosmological time as @xmath1324 .",
    "this relation is valid in the matter dominated as well as in the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "it is also valid in the holostar universe , if @xmath200 is interpreted as the proper time of the co - moving observer .",
    "the standard cosmological model furthermore has the following dependence between the total energy density and the radiation temperature : @xmath27 . in the holostar universe",
    "the same relation is valid .    on the other hand ,",
    "the holostar has some properties , which might not be compatible with our universe : when massive particles and photons are completely decoupled , the ratio of the number - density of photons with respect to the number density of massive particles is predicted to increase over time in the holostar - universe ( @xmath605 , whereas @xmath1325 ) .",
    "the standard cosmological models assumes that this ratio remains nearly constant up to high redshift .",
    "bigbang nucleosynthesis in the standard cosmological models would nt be compatible with the observations , if the photon to baryon ratio at high redshift would be very different from today .",
    "yet the holostar appears to have the potential to explain some phenomena , which are unexplained in the standard cosmological models :    the standard model has the @xmath1326- or flatness - problem .",
    "why is @xmath1326 today so close to 1 ? if @xmath1326 is not exactly 1 , it must have been close to 1 in the planck - era to an accuracy of better than @xmath1327 , i.e. the ratio of one planck length to the radius of the observable universe today .",
    "such a finetuning is highly improbable .",
    "one would expect @xmath1328 , exactly .",
    "however , in the standard cosmological models @xmath1326 is a free parameter .",
    "there is no necessity to set it equal to one .",
    "the holostar `` solves '' this problem in that there is no free parameter .",
    "the total energy density is completely fixed .",
    "any other total energy density would result in a very different metric , for which most of the results presented in this paper , as well as in @xcite , would not hold .",

    "however , the scatter in the data is very high , so that it is difficult to achieve quantitative results without setting priors on the theoretical model , such as assuming a true cosmological constant or putting restrictions on the equation of state , such as @xmath1330 .",
    "therefore other possibilities which are compatible with the data , such as nearly unaccelerated expansion in the recent past , can not be ruled out with high statistical confidence level .",
    "] in the standard cosmological model such an acceleration is `` explained '' by a positive cosmological constant , @xmath1331 .",
    "however , the natural value of the cosmological constant would be equal to the planck - density , whereas the cosmological constant today is roughly a factor of @xmath1332 smaller than its `` natural '' value . such a huge discrepancy suggests , that the cosmological constant should be exactly zero .",
    "the supernova red - shift surveys , however , appear to demand a cosmological constant which amounts to roughly @xmath816 of the critical mass - density today",
    ". why does @xmath38 have this particular value ? furthermore , @xmath38 and the mass - density scale differently with @xmath17 ( or @xmath19 ) .",
    "why then do we just happen to live in an epoch where both values are so close ?",
    "the holostar solution provides a solution to the problem of an accelerating universe without need for a cosmological constant .",
    "the holostar solution in fact requires a cosmological constant which is exactly zero , which in consequence can be interpreted as an indication that supersymmetry might well be an exact symmetry of nature .",
    "the standard model has the so called horizon problem .",
    "this problem can be traced to the fact , that in the standard cosmological models the scale factor of the universe varies as @xmath1333 in the matter - dominated era and as @xmath1334 in the radiation dominated era , whereas the hubble - length varies proportional to @xmath1335 .",
    "if the scale factor varies slower than the hubble length , the region that can be seen by an observer today will have originated from causally unconnected regions in the past .",
    "for example , at red - shift @xmath1336 , i.e. when matter and radiation have decoupled according to the standard model , the radius of the observable universe consisted of roughly @xmath1337 causally disconnected radial patches , or @xmath1338 regions .",
    "@xmath1339 is the distance scale of the expansion , @xmath1340 of the causally connected regions .",
    "the horizon problem becomes even worse in the radiation dominated era .. ] the horizon problem makes it difficult to explain why the cmbr is isotropic to such high degree .",
    "inflation is a possible solution to this problem .",
    "however , it is far from clear how and why inflation started or ended . furthermore , the inflational scenarios need quite a bit of finetuning and there appears to be no theoretical framework that could effectively restrain the different scenarios and/or their parameters .",
    "the holostar space - time solves the horizon problem in a quite elegant way .",
    "the hubble length @xmath19 is always proportional to the scale - factor in the frame of the co - moving observer , as @xmath33 and @xmath1251 , therefore everything that is visible to the co - moving observer today , was causally connected to him in the past .",
    "related to the horizon problem is the problem of the scale factor . with the @xmath839-law , in the standard cosmological models",
    "the scale factor is @xmath1341 at the planck - temperature .",
    "why would nature choose just this number ?",
    "inflation can solve this problem , albeit not in a truly convincing way . the holostar universe with @xmath363 and @xmath33 elegantly gets rid of this problem .",
    "the scale factor evolves proportional ( and within the errors equal ! ) to the hubble - length . at the planck - temperature , both the scale - factor and the hubble - length",
    "are nearly equal to the planck - length .",
    "inflation was originally introduced in order to explain the so called monopole - problem .",
    "the standard cosmological model without inflation predicts far too many monopoles .",
    "inflation , if it sets in at the right time , thins out the number of monopoles to a number consistent with the observations .",
    "it might be , that the holostar universe has an alternative solution to the problem of monopoles or other heavy particles : heavy particles will acquire geodesic motion very early in the holostar , i.e. at small @xmath19-coordinate value .",
    "but pure geodesic motion in the holostar universe tends to thin out the non - relativistic particles with respect to the still relativistic particles .",
    "inflation poses another cosmic coincidence problem : according to the recent @xmath1342-data @xmath723 to a very high degree of accuracy .",
    "@xmath723 is the relation expected for permanently unaccelerated expansion .",
    "but the standard cosmological model assumes , that the universe first accelerated ( in the inflationary phase ) , then decelerated ( in the matter- and radiation dominated phase ) and then started accelerating again ( in the `` dark energy '' dominated phase ) .",
    "all these cosmological era s are characterized by @xmath1343 .",
    "why do we happen to live just in the time , where the strange sequence of acceleration , deceleration and acceleration produces a value @xmath723 , i.e. exactly the result expected from constantly undecelerated expansion ? and",

    "a @xmath800-test of the recent supernova yields nearly identical results for the holostar model ( permanently constant expansion ) and the standard @xmath1344-model with @xmath1345 and @xmath1346 . ( the holostar - model is slightly preferred , according to the @xmath1347-test , but not with an confidence - level , that any decent researcher would tolerate as acceptable . )",
    "therefore is impossible - with the present observational data - to decide between the two models , at least not if one uses accepted statistical methods . ]",
    "if we actually live in a large holostar , we should be able to determine our current radial position @xmath19 by the formulae given in the previous sections .",
    "in principal it safest to determine @xmath19 by the total matter - density via @xmath66 , as no unknown parameters enter into this determination . using the recent wmap - data we find :    @xmath1348    this is quite close to the value @xmath1349 , which was thought to be the radius of the observable universe for a rather long period of time .    however , the ( total ) matter density is difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "although other estimates of the total mass - energy density , for example by examining the rotation curves of galaxies and clusters , all lie within the same range , the accuracy of the measurements ( including systematic errors ) is most likely not better than 5 % .    a much better accuracy can be achieved through the precise measurements of the microwave background radiation , whose temperature is known to roughly @xmath1350 .",
    "the determination of @xmath19 by the @xmath1351-temperature , however , requires the measurement or theoretical determination of the `` fundamental area '' @xmath79 .",
    "its value can be determined experimentally from both the matter - density and the radiation temperature , or theoretically as suggested in @xcite .",
    "if we use the theoretical value ( @xmath1352 ) at low energies we find :    @xmath1353    in a large holostar the momentary value of the @xmath19-coordinate can also be calculated from the local hubble - value . in order to do this , the starting point of the motion @xmath176 and the fundamental length parameter @xmath12 , or rather their ratio , have to be known .",
    "theoretically one would expect @xmath226 ( see for example section [ sec : unruh ] ) , whereas experiments point to a somewhat lower value .",
    "if we use @xmath908 and @xmath1354 we find :    @xmath1355    very remarkably , all three different methods for the determination of @xmath19 give quite consistent results , which agree by 15% .",
    "a rather large deviation comes from the hubble - value , which is not quite unexpected taking into account the difficulty of matching the different cosmological length scales .",
    "note however , that the rather good agreement depends on the assumption @xmath1356 and @xmath1357 .",
    "these assumptions , especially the second , could well prove wrong by a substantial factor .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "@xmath458 is interesting because it allows us to interpret the microwave background radiation in terms of unruh radiation .",
    "if @xmath1358 turns out to be the right ansatz , the hubble constant can be predicted .",
    "its value should be :    @xmath1359    this value is well within the measurement errors , which are mostly due to the calibration of the `` intermediate '' ladder of the cosmological distance scale via the cepheid variables .",
    "note that the absolute measurements of the hubble - constant via gravitational lensing , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , the baade - wesslink method and radioactive decay models consistently yield results in the range @xmath1360 ( km / s)/mpc , as remarked by @xcite .    without strong theoretical support for a definite value of @xmath12",
    "the matter - density seems to be the best way to determine @xmath19 .",

    "@xmath458 hasnt been confirmed independently @xmath176 should be regarded as an adjustable parameter .",
    "it is encouraging , however , that @xmath738 , as determined from the relative growth of the density perturbations after radiation and matter became kinematically decoupled , is quite close to the value determined from the measurements of the hubble - constant . ]",
    "makes the holostar solution quite attractive as an alternate model for the universe , a model that can be quite easily verified or falsified .    at the time this paper is written it not clear , whether the holostar will provide a serious alternative to the standard cosmological model .",
    "it has the potential to solve many of the known problems of the standard cosmological model .",
    "but the standard cosmological model has been very successful so far .",
    "one of its great achievements is the remarkably accurate explanation for the distribution of the light elements , produced by bigbang nucleosynthesis .",
    "although the holostar universe is in many respects similar to the standard cosmological models , it is doubtable that the synthesis of the light elements will proceed in exactly the same way as in the standard model",
    ". it would be quite a coincidence if the holostar could give a similarly accurate agreement between theory and observation .",
    "furthermore , it is not altogether clear how the `` true '' motion of the massive particles within the cosmic fluid will turn out .",
    "therefore some results from the simple analysis in this paper might have to be revised .",
    "there also is the problem of relating the observations in the frames of the co - moving observer and the observer at rest , which was discussed briefly in section [ sec : frames ] , but which quite certainly requires further more sophisticated consideration .    on the other hand , it is difficult to believe that the remarkably consistent determination of @xmath19 by three independent methods is just a numerical coincidence with no deeper physical meaning .",
    "the holostar - model of the universe also allows a prediction for the baryon - to photon number ratio , which comes close ( within a factor of 2 - 3 ) to the actually observed value .",
    "it explains the evolution of the density - perturbation fairly well and it might even have an answer for the low quadrupole and octupole moments found in the cmbr - power spectrum .",
    "therefore the question whether the holostar can serve as an alternative description of the universe should be regarded as open , hopefully decidable by research in the near future .",
    "even if the holostar does nt qualify as an accurate description of the universe , its particularly simple metric should make it a valuable theoretical laboratory to study the so far only poorly understood physical effects that arise in a universe with significant ( anisotropic ) pressure .",
    "another unexpected feature of the holographic solution is , that one can choose @xmath1362 and still get a genuine solution with `` structure '' , i.e. an interior `` source region '' with non - zero interior matter - distribution bounded by a membrane of roughly planck - area ( @xmath1363 implies @xmath1364 ) .",
    "note that the interior `` source region '' @xmath104 should not be considered as physically accessible for measurements .",
    "neither should the interior matter distribution be considered as a meaningful description of the `` interior structure '' .",
    "in fact , the holostar solution with @xmath485 and @xmath1365 should be regarded to have no physically relevant interior sub - structure .",
    "the only physically relevant quantity is its finite boundary area .",
    "the @xmath1366 solution therefore might serve as a very simple , in fact the simplest possible model for a particle of planck - size .",
    "it describes a ( spin-0 ) particle with a gravitating mass that is classically zero , as can be seen from the properties of the metric outside the `` source region '' ( i.e. @xmath1367 ) :    although it quite unlikely that an extrapolation from the experimentally verified regime of general relativity right down to the planck scale can be trusted quantitatively , the holographic solution hints at the possibility , that an elementary particle might be - at least approximately - describable as a self - gravitating system .",
    "there are remarkable similarities between the properties of black holes and elementary particles .",
    "as has already been noted by carter @xcite the kerr - newmann solution has a gyromagnetic ratio of 2 , i.e. its g - factor is equal to that of the electron ( disregarding radiative corrections ) .",
    "the ( three ) quadrupole moments of the kerr - newman solution are @xmath1368 and @xmath1369 in respective units , an interesting analogue to the fractional charges of the three quarks confined within the nucleon ? !",
    "it is not altogether folly to identify elementary particles with highly gravitating systems . for energies approaching",
    "the planck - scale gravity becomes comparable to the other forces .",
    "therefore an elementary particle will quite certainly become a strongly gravitating system at high energies . however , the identification of an elementary particle with a solution to the classical field equations of general relativity at the low end of the energy scale has so far met serious obstacles .",
    "it is difficult to explain why the masses of the light elementary particles are about 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the planck - mass .",
    "the common expectation , that the planck - mass will be the minimum mass of a compact self gravitating object can be traced to the fact , that the only `` natural '' unit of mass which can be constructed from the three fundamental constants of nature @xmath1370 and @xmath83 is the planck mass .",
    "thus it seems evident , that any `` fundamental '' theory of nature which incorporates the three constants , must have fundamental particles of roughly planck - mass .",
    "this quite certainly would be true , if mass always remains a `` fundamental '' parameter of nature , even at the most extreme energy scales .",
    "however , there might be a slight misconception about the significance of mass in high gravitational fields . without doubt , `` mass '' is a fundamental quantity both in newton s theory of gravitation and in quantum field theories such as qed or qcd .",
    "these theories have very heavily influenced the conception of mass as a fundamental quantity of physics . in a geometric theory , such as einstein s theory of general relativity , mass comes not as a natural property of a space - time - manifold . from a general relativistic viewpoint mass is nt a geometric property at all and enters into the equations of general relativity in a rather crude way , as stated by einstein himself .",
    "furthermore , mass has dimensions of length . from the viewpoint of loop quantum gravity length - in contrast to area ( or volume ) - is a concept which is difficult to define .",
    "therefore it is questionable if mass will remain a fundamental parameter in situations of high gravity , where the geometry can not be considered static but becomes dynamic itself .",
    "in these situations it seems more `` natural '' to describe the interacting ( geometric ) objects not by their mass , but rather by the area of their boundaries .",
    "mass appears rather as a perturbation .",
    "surfaces as basis for the `` natural '' description of systems with high gravitational fields are not only motivated by recent research results , such as the holographic principle @xcite , the study of light - sheets @xcite and isolated horizons @xcite , or m - theory , but also by the simple fact , that in natural units @xmath49 area has dimension of action ( or angular momentum ) , from which we know that it is quantized in units of @xmath1371 .",
    "therefore the `` elementary '' holostar with zero gravitational mass , but non - zero boundary area might serve as a very crude classical approximation for the most simple elementary particle with zero angular momentum and charge . unfortunately none of the known particles can be identified with the `` elementary '' uncharged and spherically symmetric holostar - solution with @xmath485 . even if a spin - zero uncharged and zero mass particle exists , it is unlikely that more than its cross - sectional area can be `` predicted '' by the holostar solution . still it will be interesting to compare the properties of a charged and/or rotating holostar to the properties of the known elementary particles in order to see how far the equations of classical general relativity allow us to go",

    "the holostar solution appears as an attractive alternative for a black hole .",
    "it has a surface temperature , which - measured at spatial infinity - is proportional to the hawking temperature .",
    "its total number of interior relativistic particles is proportional to its proper surface area , which can be interpreted as evidence that the hawking entropy is of microscopic - statistical origin and the holographic principle is valid in classical general relativity for self gravitating objects of arbitrary size .",

    "<S> this paper discusses the so called holographic solution , in short `` holostar '' . the holostar is the simplest exact , spherically symmetric solution of the original einstein field equations with zero cosmological constant , including matter . </S>",
    "<S> the interior matter - distribution follows an inverse square law @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the interior principal pressures are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which is the equation of state for a collection of radial strings with string tension @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the interior space - time is separated from the exterior vacuum space - time by a spherical two - dimensional boundary membrane , consisting out of ( tangential ) pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the membrane has zero mass - energy . </S>",
    "<S> its stress - energy content is equal to the holostar s gravitational mass . </S>",
    "<S> the total gravitational mass of a holostar can be determined by a proper integral over the lorentz - invariant trace of the stress - energy tensor .    </S>",
    "<S> the holostar exhibits properties similar to the properties of black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the exterior space - time of the holostar is identical to that of a schwarzschild black hole , due to birkhoff s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the membrane has the same properties ( i.e. the same pressure ) as the fictitious membrane attributed to a black hole according to the membrane paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> this guarantees that the dynamical action of the holostar on the exterior space - time is identical to that of a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the holostar possesses an internal temperature proportional to @xmath4 and a surface redshift proportional to @xmath5 , from which the hawking temperature and entropy formula for a spherically symmetric black hole are derived up to a constant factor .    </S>",
    "<S> the holostar s interior matter - state is singularity - free . </S>",
    "<S> it can be interpreted as the most compact spherically symmetric ( i.e. radial ) arrangement of classical strings : the radially outlayed strings are densely packed , each string occupies exactly one planck area in its transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> this maximally dense arrangement is the reason why the holostar does not collapse to a singularity and why the number of interior degrees of freedom scales with area . </S>",
    "<S> although the holostar s _ total _ interior matter state has an overall string equation of state , _ part _ of the matter can be interpreted in terms of particles . </S>",
    "<S> the number of zero rest - mass particles within any concentric region of the holostar s interior is shown to be proportional to the proper area of its boundary , implying that the holostar is compatible with the holographic principle and the bekenstein entropy - area bound , not only from a string but also from a particle perspective .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to a black hole , the holostar - metric is static throughout the whole space - time . </S>",
    "<S> there are no trapped surfaces and no event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> information is not lost . </S>",
    "<S> the weak and strong energy conditions are fulfilled everywhere , except for a planck - size region at the center . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the holostar can serve as an alternative model for a compact self - gravitating object of any conceivable size .    </S>",
    "<S> the holostar is the prototype of a closed system in thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> its lifetime is several orders of magnitude higher than its interior relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic properties of the interior space - time can be derived exclusively from the geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the local entropy - density @xmath6 in the interior space - time is exactly equal to the proper geodesic acceleration of a stationary observer , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is related to the local energy - density via @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy in the interior space - time is minimized to zero , i.e. @xmath9 . disregarding the slow process of hawking evaporation , energy and entropy </S>",
    "<S> are conserved locally and globally .    </S>",
    "<S> although the holostar is a static solution , it behaves dynamically with respect to the interior motion of its constituent particles . </S>",
    "<S> geodesic motion of massive particles in a large holostar is nearly radial and exhibits properties very similar to what is found in the observable universe : any material observer moving geodesically outward will observe an isotropic outward directed hubble - flow of massive particles from his local frame of reference . </S>",
    "<S> an inward moving observer experiences an inward directed hubble - flow . </S>",
    "<S> the outward motion is associated with an increase in entropy , the inward motion with a decrease . </S>",
    "<S> the radial motion of the geodesically moving observer is accelerated , with the proper acceleration falling off over time ( for an outward moving observer ) . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration is due to the interior metric , there is no cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> geodesic motion of massive particles is highly relativistic , as viewed from the stationary coordinate system . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10-factor of an inward or outward moving observer is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a fundamental length parameter which can be determined experimentally and theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 . inmoving and outmoving matter is essentially decoupled , as the collision cross - sections of ordinary matter must be divided by @xmath14 , which evaluates to @xmath15 at the radial position of an observer corresponding to the current radius of the universe .    the total matter - density @xmath16 , viewed from the extended lorentz - frame of a geodesically moving observer , decreases over proper time @xmath17 with @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial coordinate position @xmath19 of the observer evolves proportional to @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the local hubble value is given by @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> although the relation @xmath21 seems to imply a highly non - homogeneous matter - distribution , the large - scale matter - distribution seen by a geodesically moving observer within his observable local hubble - volume is homogeneous by all practical purposes . </S>",
    "<S> the large - scale matter - density within the hubble - volume differs at most by @xmath22 at radial position @xmath23 , corresponding to the current hubble - radius of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the high degree of homogeneity in the frame of the co - moving observer arises from the combined effect of radial ruler distance shrinkage due the radial metric coefficient ( @xmath24 and lorentz - contraction in the radial direction because of the highly relativistic geodesic motion , which is nearly radial with @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> the geodesically moving observer is immersed in a bath of zero rest - mass particles ( photons ) , whose temperature decreases with @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> geodesic motion of photons within the holostar preserves the planck - distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the radial position of an observer can be determined via the local mass - density , the local radiation - temperature , the local entropy - density or the local hubble - flow . </S>",
    "<S> using the experimentally determined values for the matter - density of the universe , the hubble - value and the cmbr - temperature , values of @xmath19 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 are calculated , i.e values very close to the current radius and age of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the holographic solution might serve as an alternative model for a universe with an overall negative ( string type ) equation of state , without need for a cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the holostar as a model for a black hole or the universe contains no free parameters : the holostar metric and fields , as well as the initial conditions for geodesic motion are completely fixed and arise naturally from the solution . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the characteristic properties of geodesic motion in the interior space - time points to the possibility , that the holostar - solution might contribute substantially to the understanding of the phenomena in our universe . </S>",
    "<S> the holostar model of the universe is free of most of the problems of the standard cosmological models , such as the `` cosmic - coincidence - problem '' , the `` flatness - problem '' , the `` horizon - problem '' , the `` cosmological - constant problem '' etc . . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant is exactly zero . </S>",
    "<S> there is no horizon - problem , as the co - moving distance @xmath19 evolves exactly proportional to the hubble - radius ( @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> inflation is not needed . </S>",
    "<S> there is no initial singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion (= radially outward directed geodesic motion ) starts out from a plank - size region at the planck - temperature , which contains at most one `` particle '' with roughly 1/8 to 1/5 of the planck - mass . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum angular separation of particles starting out from the center is limited to roughly @xmath32 , which could explain the low quadrupole and octupole - moments in the cmbr - power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath33 for @xmath34 , whose fundamental origin can be traced to the zero active gravitational mass - density of the string - type matter in the interior space - time , can be interpreted in terms of a permanently unaccelerated expansion , from which @xmath35 follows . </S>",
    "<S> this genuine prediction of the holostar model is very close to the observations , which give values between @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> permanently undecelerated expansion is also compatible with the luminosity - redshift relation derived from the most recent supernova - measurements , although the experimental results favor the concordance @xmath38cdm - model over the holostar - model at roughly @xmath39 confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> the hubble value in the holostar - model of the universe turns out lower than in the concordance model . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> this puts @xmath41 into the range of the other absolute measurements , which consistently give values @xmath42 and is compatible with the recent supernova - data , which favor values in the range @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> geodesic motion of particles in the holostar space - time preserves the relative energy - densities of the different particle species ( not their number - densities ! ) , from which a baryon - to photon ratio of roughly @xmath44 at @xmath45 is predicted .    </S>",
    "<S> the holographic solution also admits microscopic self - gravitating objects with a surface area of roughly the planck - area and zero gravitating mass . </S>"
