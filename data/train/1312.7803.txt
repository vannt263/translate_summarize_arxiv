    "choice plays an essential role in queuing and optimization theory @xcite , in the structure of random recursive trees @xcite and evolving random graphs @xcite , in explosive percolation @xcite , and in the control of avalanches in self - organized criticality  @xcite .",
    "we all familiar with choice in grocery checkout , customs , and security lines , where we would like to be in the line with the shortest waiting time .",
    "picking one of @xmath0 lines at random results in a maximal waiting time of the order of @xmath4 . if instead one initially selects two lines at random and then chooses the line with the smaller number of customers , the maximal waiting time drops to @xmath5 .",
    "further increasing the number of initially selected lines improves the maximal waiting time only by a constant factor , thereby illustrating the `` power of two choices '' @xcite .",
    "growing networks with choice were investigated in @xcite , where the choice was made to attach the new node to the node closest to the root .",
    "choice has also been implemented in evolving random graphs ( networks with fixed number of nodes and growing number of links ) , where it has been shown that appropriate choice may delay  @xcite or speed up  @xcite the appearance of the giant component .",
    "one particular example of choice - driven link addition in evolving random graphs has recently attracted considerable attention @xcite , as it leads a percolation transition which is explosive in character .        in this work ,",
    "we determine how a degree - based choice affects the growth of complex networks  @xcite . instead of a new node attaching to a target node according to a specified rate",
    ", we select a fixed number of targets according to this rate and the new node attaches to the target with the largest degree``greedy '' choice ( fig .  [ model ] ) .",
    "when the targets are selected randomly and independent of their degrees  @xcite , it was found that the degree distribution decays exponentially with degree , but at a slower rate than in the case with no choice . when the targets are selected according to the preferential attachment mechanism , the effect of the choice is much more dramatic as we show below .    as an example , consider the situation where _ two _ targets are provisionally selected , each with the probability proportional to @xmath6 for a target of degree @xmath7 .",
    "then our results can be summarized as follows . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the network has a degree distribution with an algebraic tail that possesses a non - universal exponent ( i.e. , dependent on @xmath9 ) .",
    "this exponent is smaller than in the case of no choice ; thus choice broadens the degree distribution . for @xmath10 ( strictly linear preferential attachment ) ,",
    "the degree distribution has a power - law tail with the smallest possible exponent that is consistent with the network remaining sparse .",
    "more precisely , the fraction of nodes of degree @xmath7 asymptotically decays as @xmath1 , with the logarithmic factor ensuring that the network is sparse . for @xmath11 ,",
    "a macrohub ( a node whose degree grows linearly with the number of nodes in the network ) emerges ; the remainder of the degree distribution is still characterized by a non - universal algebraic tail .",
    "these properties are qualitatively robust for greedy choice with at least two alternatives , although the critical value of @xmath9 depends on the number of alternatives ; in the case when @xmath12 target nodes are provisionally selected , then @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , when attachment occurs to a target whose degree is less than the largest among the target set  which we term `` meek choice''a double - exponential degree distribution arises , where @xmath14 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , this behavior occurs even if attachment occurs to the second - largest out of a large number of targets .",
    "thus greedy choice is the unique case and all other less greedy attachment choices lead to a double - exponential degree distribution .",
    "two examples of small networks grown by greedy and meek choice from two alternatives are shown in fig .  [ pix ] .",
    "we start by studying the degree distribution in networks where growth is driven by greedy choice between two alternatives .",
    "let @xmath15 be the number of nodes of degree @xmath7 when the network contains @xmath0 total nodes .",
    "although the @xmath15 are random variables , fluctuations in these quantities are small when the network is large .",
    "we thus focus on the averages @xmath16 in the limit of large @xmath0 , where we may replace @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "we also drop the angle brackets henceforth .",
    "the evolution of the degree distribution in this greedy choice model is governed by the master equations @xmath19 ^ 2   -\\left[\\frac{a_kn_{k}}{a}\\right]^2+\\delta_{k,1}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is the rate at which a node of degree @xmath7 is selected as a potential target and @xmath21 the total rate . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .   accounts for the increase in @xmath22 due to the new node attaching to a node of degree @xmath23 .",
    "such an event occurs if the two initial targets have degrees @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the complementary gain term has a similar origin , while the quadratic terms on the second line account for events where the two targets have the same degree .",
    "the master equations satisfy the sum rules @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the class of shifted linear attachment rates given by @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the total rate becomes @xmath27 .",
    "we are interested in the @xmath28 limit , so we simply write @xmath29 .",
    "the fraction of nodes of fixed degree becomes size independent when @xmath28 , so that @xmath30 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using this fact , we recast into @xmath31 where @xmath32    let us now specialize to strictly linear preferential attachment , or @xmath10 .",
    "the solutions to the first few of the recurrences can be found straightforwardly and give @xmath33 etc . to obtain the asymptotic form of the degree distribution , it is convenient to analyze in the continuum approximation .",
    "to lowest order , we use the asymptotic behavior @xmath34 as @xmath35 , which follows from @xmath26 , and we also ignore the terms on the second line . these approximations simplify eq .   to @xmath36 , which gives @xmath37 . however , this solution can not be correct , as the sum @xmath38 logarithmically diverges .",
    "the inconsistency arises because the terms that were dropped are of the same order , namely @xmath39 , as those in the approximate equation @xmath36 .",
    "as will become plausible with hindsight , a logarithmic correction in the asymptotic degree distribution can be anticipated .",
    "we thus seek a solution of the form @xmath40 substituting this ansatz into , keeping all terms , and using the continuum approximation , gives    @xmath41    or , in terms of the cumulative variable @xmath42 , @xmath43 where we now view @xmath44 as a function of @xmath45 .",

    "a convenient way to implement shifted linear preferential attachment is by the redirection algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm consists of : ( i ) selecting a target node uniformly at random from the existing network ; ( ii ) a new node either attaches to this target with probability @xmath67 or to the parent of the target with probability @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",

    "the source of this inconsistency is that our analysis has ignored the possibility of a transition to a new type of `` condensed '' network that contains a macrohub  a node whose degree is of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "let us assume that such a macrohub of degree @xmath79 exists , with @xmath80 of the order of 1 . to determine the degree of this macrohub",
    ", we now exploit the equivalence between shifted linear attachment and the redirection algorithm . according to redirection , whenever a random target node is selected",
    ", redirection will lead to the macrohub being chosen with probability @xmath81 .",
    "the probability of choosing this hub at least once in the two independent selection events is @xmath82 .",
    "this quantity gives the growth rate of the hub , so that @xmath83 this equation has two solutions , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 the former ( trivial ) solution is relevant when the redirection probability @xmath86 , while the non - trivial solution is realized when @xmath87 .",
    "an important feature of this macrohub is that it is unique . to justify this statement ,",

    "to numerically implement greedy choice for shifted linear preferential attachment , we simply allow for choice in the redirection algorithm  @xcite .",

    "we outline how to deal with the situation where loops are created when each new node attaches to @xmath150 already existing nodes , with each attachment event created by the same choice - driven algorithm as in the previous section . limiting ourselves to shifted linear attachment and focusing on greedy choice from two alternatives ,",
    "the recursion for @xmath57 is given by ( compare with eq .  )",
    "@xmath151    this recurrence can be analyzed using the same methods as in the case of trees .",

    "@xmath10 , the solutions for small degrees are : @xmath164 etc .",
    "notice that while the first few @xmath57 are larger than those for greedy choice in eqs .  , the asymptotic degree distribution decays precipitously with @xmath7 ( fig .  [ nks ] ) .",
    "for example , in simulations of 50 realizations of networks grown to @xmath114 nodes , the largest observed degree is only 9 !    we now exploit this rapid decay to determine the asymptotic behavior of the degree distribution . for large @xmath7 ,",
    "an increase in @xmath57 can occur only if the two target nodes have degree @xmath165 .",
    "thus we posit that the dominant term in is @xmath166 . keeping only this term ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the logarithm of the degree distribution is given by @xmath167 up to some amplitude @xmath168 that can not be determined within this simplified analysis .",
    "one can then verify that the remaining terms in are subdominant . from this asymptotic degree distribution",
    ", we estimate the maximal degree in a network of @xmath0 nodes to be @xmath169 , as recently proven in  ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when @xmath12 distinct initial target nodes are selected by preferential attachment , there are @xmath12 possibilities for the attachment event : to the highest - degree node , to the second - highest degree node , all the way to the lowest - degree node .",
    "while the combinatorics become unwieldy for the general case of identifying the target node with the @xmath170-largest degree out of @xmath12 choices , the dominant contribution to @xmath57 for large @xmath7 arises when @xmath150 targets have degree @xmath165 and the remaining @xmath171 targets have degrees less than @xmath165 . following the same reasoning as in the case of attaching to the smallest - degree node out of two choices , the dominant term in the generalization of is proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "this leads to @xmath173 .",
    "thus for all but greedy choice , the degree distribution decays precipitously with degree .    from this asymptotic degree distribution",
    ", the maximal degree grows with @xmath0 as @xmath174 for @xmath144 .",
    "the exponent @xmath175 that appears in depends on the number of alternatives @xmath12 and on details of the attachment rate . for strictly linear preferential attachment , @xmath176 , where the degree @xmath80 of the macrohub is the positive solution of the equation @xmath177 .",
    "the other ultra - slow growth laws in are robust with respect to the details of the attachment rule .",
    "these latter behaviors do not depend on the details of the selection rule as long as the choice is less than greedy .",
    "incorporating choice in preferential attachment network growth leads to rich phenomenology in which the effect of preferential attachment can be strongly amplified or entirely eliminated .",
    "we have explored a general class of models in which a set of target nodes in the network are first selected according to preferential attachment and then a new node joins the network by attaching to one of these target nodes according to a specified criterion . in greedy choice",
    ", attachment is made to the target with the largest degree .",
    "we also investigated attaching to a node in the target set whose degree is not the largest . for a target set of @xmath12 nodes , there are @xmath178 possible such choices  to the @xmath179-largest degree node , the @xmath180-largest , @xmath181 , to the smallest - degree node .",
    "we term this class of models as meek choice .",

    "the degree distribution has a power law tail that is considerably broader than in the case of no choice . in the super - critical phase ,",
    "a macrohub emerges , while the remainder of the degree distribution is still algebraic . at the boundary between these two phases",
    ", the degree distribution decays as @xmath182 .",
    "this form for the degree distribution is consistent with a finite average degree in the network because of the presence of the logarithmic factor .",
    "the influence of meek choice is perhaps even more dramatic , as it effectively counteracts preferential attachment .",
    "when @xmath12 target nodes are initially selected , meek choice means that the new node attaches to a target whose degree is less than the highest in the target set . for the case where a new node attaches to the @xmath170-largest degree out of a target set of @xmath12 nodes that are",
    "each selected by linear preferential attachment , meek choice leads to a double - exponential degree distribution of the form @xmath183 , and a maximal degree that is of the order of @xmath184 .",
    "it is surprising that this sharp decay should hold for attachment to the target with the @xmath179-highest degree out of @xmath185 targets . in this case",
    ", the degree distribution will initially resemble that of greedy choice and the crossover to a precipitous decay will occur at an extremely large degree value .                                            for reviews ,",
