    "one of the main problems of convex optimization is the determination of the maximum value of a linear function over a convex set . despite its reputation as the class of all  tractable \" optimization problems , such special cases contain an enormous variety of instances of very different complexity .",
    "specifically , work of grtschel , lvasz and schrijver  @xcite shows that the ability to approximate optima of linear programs on a class of convex sets in polynomial time to a prescribed accuracy is equivalent to the existence of a ( weak ) polynomial time membership oracle for this class . for many classes of convex sets , for instance the copositive cones  @xcite or the cones of nonnegative polynomials  @xcite ,",
    "such membership problems have been shown to be np hard .",
    "nevertheless , optimizing over such complicated cones @xmath0 is often a problem of much interest .",
    "a possible alternative is to sacrifice precision for efficiency .",
    "we replace our convex set @xmath0 by a simpler convex set @xmath5 which is a good approximation for @xmath0 in a suitable sense and such that efficient optimization over @xmath5 is possible .",
    "natural choices for such @xmath5 are polyhedra and more generally spectrahedra or sdr sets .",
    "approximations by such convex sets are of practical importance due to the availability of efficient interior point optimization algorithms  @xcite on them .    the problem of how to construct such approximations @xmath5 has been studied by several authors .",
    "there is considerable literature in the problem of approximating convex bodies by polytopes ( see for instance  @xcite for a survey ) as well as important work by gouveia , lasserre , laurent , parrilo , thomas and others ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) who propose approximation schemes for convex semialgebraic sets by sdr sets based on sums of squares relaxations .    in this article , we study another approximation strategy due to barvinok and veomett  @xcite and lasserre  @xcite .",
    "their construction allows us to approximate arbitrary convex sets which support a measure via a sequence of sdr sets .",
    "this article contains three main contributions concerning this approximation strategy .",
    "first , we give general conditions under which such sequences converge to the desired convex set .",
    "second , we prove that in the presence of enough symmetries the speed of convergence ( as measured by a scaling factor to be defined precisely ) can be determined by solving a semidefinite program .",
    "third , we give explicit upper bounds for the scaling factors of these sequences on two special classes of convex sets : traveling salesman polytopes and cones of nonnegative polynomials in several variables .",
    "such bounds are necessary if one intends to optimize over these cones following the approximation strategy outlined earlier and also have considerable mathematical interest since they are natural invariants of the cones .    in the remainder of this introduction",
