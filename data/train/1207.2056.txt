    "[ fig : nici ] , after psf subtraction .",
    "_ sinfoni integral field spectra_. we also conducted complementary integral - field - unit spectroscopy with the sinfoni instrument on the vlt in order to search for possible planetary objects in the gap . in our setup",
    "we chose a very narrow jittering throw that samples the inner @xmath21  arcsec@xmath22 only .",
    "we processed the eso pipeline datacubes using spectral deconvolution techniques @xcite , and also through conventional psf subtraction ( using a psf standard star ) .",
    "the detection limits we achieve are consistent with those achieved by @xcite in ab  dor with the same instrument ( @xmath09  mag contrast at 0.2  @xmath18 separation ) .",
    "the nici images clearly reveal the non axi - symmetric shape of the cavity .",
    "this is the highlight of our observations .",
    "the shape is roughly elliptical , albeit with significant departures , with a representative eccentricity of @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the ellipse axes ) .",
    "but , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : nici_annot ] , the exterior ring can be described as being composed of four arms overlapping in their extremities , except for two small , @xmath00.2  arcsec gaps or intensity nulls along the ring , due north and south - south - east from the star .",
    "the observation of these morphological feature is based on the shape of the inner rim of the ring seen in direct images ( even without subtraction of the psf glare ) .",
    "additionally , an unresolved brightness increment , or knot , can be seen along the north - western segment ( which is also the brightest segment ) - the alignment of this unresolved feature in all filters is illustrated in the rgb image , although we can not determine from these data alone if this knot is real or perhaps only a ghost or a chance alignment of speckles .",
    "the south - western spiral arm segment ( labelled arm 2 on fig .",
    "[ fig : nici_annot ] ) sprouts away from the outer ring at a pa of -45  deg ( east of north ) , where it extends into the outer arm seen by @xcite .",
    "this outer arm is at much fainter levels than the outer ring - our dataset has finer resolution but is shallower , so that only its root is seen in our figures .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this outer arm could have been triggered by a stellar encounter , but the putative partner remains to be identified .",
    "a nearby point source turned out to be a background star @xcite - in our nici images this source is located at a separation of 5.44 from hd  142527 , and a pa of 220  deg ( east of north ) .",
    "the inner radius of the ring varies from 0.7@xmath18 to the north , to about 1.0@xmath18 to the south , and a projection effect is discarded since the central star is clearly offset by @xmath1 from the centre of this approximate ellipse .",
    "this offset was first noted by @xcite , albeit at lower angular resolution .    in @xmath9-band",
    "the west side of the rim we see is brighter , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "@xcite and already noted that in the thermal  ir , @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands , it is the _ eastern _ side that is brightest , which is consistent with a projection effect @xcite . at the shorter wavelength @xmath9-band ,",
    "the front ( i.e. nearest ) side of the disk appears brighter because of forward scattering at the surface of the disk . on the opposite ,",
    "the thermal emission from the larger projected surface of the rim of the back side of the disk appears brighter than the slimmer ( in projection ) rim of the near side .",
    "this implies a major axis of the disk in the north - south direction and a minor axis in the e - w direction ( as observed here ) .",
    "the emission null we detect due north is seen on both sets of subaru images , at @xmath9-band and in the mid - ir as well .",
    "no companion is clearly detected in our nici images .",
    "an upper limit on a binary companion is difficult to obtain because of the speckle noise , and because of the lack of accurate nici zero points .",
    "however , the sinfoni observations allow us to place a lower limit flux ratio at 0.20.3@xmath18 separation of 1905 at 3  @xmath11 in @xmath9 ; fig .  [",
    "fig : sinfo ] illustrates this upper limit . modeling the sed we estimate that half of the total flux density of hd  142527 in k can be assigned to the disk . in that case , the sinfoni flux ratio limit of 1905 corresponds to an absolute magnitude @xmath28 at 3  @xmath11 . as a comparison point",
    "we refer to the cond03 tracks at 1  myr of age , which would imply a mass of less than 12  m@xmath2 given this @xmath29 limit .",
    "however the age of hd  142527 and the models are not precise enough to ascertain this upper limit mass value .",
    "we stress again that this limit constrains the presence of massive gaseous giants at stellocentric radii of 14 to 35  au .",
    "the contribution from photoevaporation to cavity clearing can be neglected in this case .",
    "the inner disk , the large gap and the vigorous accretion rate of @xmath30  m@xmath31  yr  @xmath32 argue against photoevaporation .",
    "an x - ray driven wind can indeed explain a subset of the observed accreting disks with inner holes , but only those with radii smaller than 20  au and accretion rates less than 10@xmath33  m@xmath31  yr  @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "gap clearing by single or multiple planets could potentially explain wide gaps observed in transitional disks @xcite .",
    "we thus focus on the simplest possible scenario to interpret the morphology of the cavity in hd  142527 s disk , i.e. dynamical clearing by one single embedded and massive - jupiter - size planet opening a gap in its gaseous disk .",
    "the maximum gap opening width will depend on the mass and the orbital parameters of this planet @xcite .",
    "the cavity forms due to the torque exerted by the star ",
    "planet binary @xcite .",
    "elliptical cavities have been predicted with @xmath34 in the case of _ circular _ binaries with mass ratios @xmath35 , in which case the gap becomes large enough to deplete the region in which the eccentricity - damping outer 1:3 lindblad resonance is produced .",
    "further numerical work @xcite shows that , for eccentric binaries , the outer edge of the cavity becomes even more eccentric .",
    "the observed eccentric cavity is then a recurrent feature of gap - clearing models .      in order to test further the single - planet origin for the wide gap in the gaseous disk of hd  142527",
    ", we conducted hydrodynamic simulations with fargo .",
    "our goal here is not to fit the data but to verify qualitatively the tenability of this scenario for hd  142527 .",
    "fargo is a dedicated grid - based 2d code publicly available on the web , and specifically designed for planet  disk interactions .",
    "the run presented in this paper corresponds to a system evolution equivalent to 1.7  myr .",
    "we picked common fiducial parameters for the model , as detailed below .",
    "the model disk is initially axisymmetric , its surface density is initially a power law of radius , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 m@xmath12  au@xmath22 ) at @xmath39  au , so slightly smaller than the value assumed by @xcite . the model disk has a constant pressure scale height @xmath8 over radius @xmath40 with value @xmath41 . for the disk calculations the boundaries are 4 and 300  au for the inner and outer radii , respectively , giving a total mass of 0.1  m@xmath12 .",
    "the inner boundary is open , allowing mass to fall onto the star , while the outer boundary is such that we allow for a steady state mass transfer into the disk .",
    "accretion across the disk is modeled by using an @xmath42 prescription .",
    "we adopted @xmath43 following @xcite . from the sinfoni limits described above we know that any planet present in the inner 14 to 35  au can not have a mass exceeding @xmath012 jupiter masses .",
    "we assume no such planet is present further out in the disk either , and chose a planet mass of 10  @xmath44 .",
    "we placed a 10  @xmath44 planet in a fixed circular orbit at 90  au in the model disk .",
    "this radius was chosen so that the planet s sphere of influence , given by a few times its hill radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reaches the observed gap size of @xmath0130  au .",
    "migration was inhibited until a sizeable gap was carved by the planet .",
    "this artificial constraint stems from the lack of heat or momentum diffusion in fargo @xcite .    the resulting gas surface density field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fargo ] .",
    "this specific dynamically perturbed morphology will persist over a timescale of a few tens of thousand years ( i.e , around 100 orbits ) but is not in steady state .",
    "the rim will remain asymmetric over time , and is composed of tightly wound spiral arms , whose superposition forms a roughly elliptical cavity .",
    "the cavity centroid is persistently offset from the star , but any particular morphology of the gap is transient and lasts about 100 orbits . in this snapshot view ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fargo ] ) , the outer edges of the cavity are most reminiscent of those seen in the nici images .",
    "the cavity eccentricity is @xmath00.6 , and its centroid is offset from the star by @xmath016 au .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fargo ] , this model produces a massive inner disc , extending out to 50 - 60  au in radius , which is not consistent with the observations .",
    "additional ingredients are required to deplete that region in the framework of a dynamical clearing model , e.g. , additional planets closer to the star ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "fitting the inner disc is left for future work .",
    "we stress that the purpose of these simulations is to provide a plausible explanation of the nici observations of the inner edge of the outer disk only .",
    "our observations of hd  142527 indicate that the inner rim of its outer disk is roughly elliptical , and composed of an overlapping set of spiral arm segments .",
    "we confirm that the star is offset by @xmath1 from the centroid of the cavity .",
    "no companion is detected in the range of 14 to 35  au , with a lower limit @xmath28 at 3  @xmath11 ( for a distance of 140  pc ) .",
    "the observed morphology of the disk in hd  142527 suggests a dynamically perturbed state",
    ". the segmented spirals , and the offset between the cavity centroid and the star , can be seen among the varied morphologies predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of hd  142527 .",
    "to explore , at least qualitatively , the origin of the cavity and its peculiar shape , we reported on a simple case . a massive protoplanet on a circular orbit whose radius is comparable to the disk s outer edge perturbs the entire disk , which does not reach steady state even after thousands of orbits .",
    "the global shape of the cavity is a long - standing feature ; the general asymmetries ( off - center star , eccentricity of the cavity ) are imprinted early and remain for the duration of the calculations .",
    "however , the specific configuration of the model run , position of the streamers , and position and number of spiral arms , form a specific morphology that is only a transient phase .",
    "a particular morphology may recur , but lasts for a limited number of orbits .",
    "that phase which qualitatively matches hd  142527 lasts for a hundred orbits or so .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that the observed shape of the disk rim of hd  142527 today will also be brief compared to its age , with features that are unlikely to be found in other systems that are also undergoing dynamical clearing . in this scenario ,",
    "snapshot imaging of transition disks are likely to look different in their fine details",
    ". however , there should be common features like off - centering of the central star , non axi - symmetry of the disk rim , and presence of spiral arms .",
    "current imaging campaigns are indeed revealing these structures , as in hd  100546 @xcite ; hd  135344b @xcite ; ab  aur @xcite .",
    "interstingly , the list of known transition disks is rapdily increasing with improving observational capabilities both in direct imaging at optical / near - ir ( see e.g. , the citations above ) and in the sub - mm regime @xcite",
    ". we should be able to verify these ideas in the near future , specifically that the observed morphological variety of transition disks derives from a common dynamical history in this evolutionnary stage when there is large - scale feedback between the planet formation process and its parent disk .",
    "a key to test this transient scenario for hd  142527 and transition disks in general would be to detect the gap - crossing planetary accretion flow and link it to the outer - disk asymmetries .",
    "meanwhile , a quantitative comparison with hydrodynamic models requires radiative transfer calculations on the model density fields .",
    "while this article was under review @xcite reported on a tentative detection of a low - mass stellar companion to hd  142527 , at @xmath013  au , so abutting on the inner disk .",
    "this companion is inferred through parametrised - modeling of visibility data .",
    "if real , this stellar companion will strongly impact on the inner disk , and its inclusion in simulation may bring closer agreement with the observed inner disk properties",
    ". this would be particularly interesting given that our one - planet scenario currently fails to reproduce the properties of the inner disk .",
    "it is currently too large in radius and mass , compared with observations . including a second body in the simulation would produce a larger gap with a smaller inner disk ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "however , hd  142527b alone probably can not explain the extent of the cavity .",
    "a single body can not clear a gap wider than @xmath05 times its tidal radius ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is known as the hill radius .",
    "mass and semi - major axis estimates for the companion star detected by @xcite give a hill radius @xmath47  au .",
