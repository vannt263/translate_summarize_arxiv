    "the application of exact faddeev three - body theory to the understanding of nuclear reactions that are dominated , at low energies , by three - body degrees of freedom has been shadowed in the past by the difficulty in dealing with the long - range coulomb interaction between charged particles .",
    "up to now this difficulty has been overcome by the use of approximate theoretical methods , namely , the continuum - discretized coupled - channel ( cdcc ) method @xcite , which was proposed initially to deal with deuteron scattering on a heavier nuclei , but that is now widely used to analyze data resulting from the reactions involving halo nuclei . given the progress achieved recently in the description of proton - deuteron @xmath1 elastic scattering and breakup using exact three - body equations @xcite , we are now able to include the coulomb interaction in three - body nuclear reactions involving two charged particles . before we apply the present method to the description of direct nuclear reactions that are dominated by three - body degrees of freedom , we show here the results for alpha - deuteron @xmath2 scattering which at low energies is one of simplest effective three - body nuclear reactions .",
    "the @xmath3 scattering has been studied extensively in the past , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "although @xmath3 is a six - nucleon system , at low energies , to a good approximation , the @xmath0 particle may be considered a spin zero structureless boson , and thereby the theoretical description of @xmath3 scattering may be reduced to a three - body problem made up of one @xmath0 and two nucleons @xmath4 .",
    "then , the most serious difficulty is the treatment of the long - range coulomb interaction , which in the previous calculations was either completely neglected or taken into account only approximately . using the method developed in refs .",
    "@xcite we are now able to include the coulomb interaction also for @xmath3 scattering , quantitatively evaluate its importance , and with greater confidence ascertain the quality of @xmath5 force models .    section  [ sec : th ] shortly recalls the technical apparatus underlying the calculations .",
    "section  [ sec : res ] presents characteristic results .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] gives our conclusions .",
    "our treatment of the coulomb interaction is based on the idea of screening and renormalization proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for two - particle scattering and extended in refs .",
    "@xcite to three - particle scattering where only two particles are charged .",
    "the coulomb potential is screened , standard scattering theory is applicable , and the renormalization procedure is applied to recover the unscreened limit .",
    "the success of the method depends on the choice of the screened coulomb potential @xmath6 we prefer to work with a sharper screening than the yukawa screening @xmath7 of ref .",
    "we want to ensure that the screened coulomb potential @xmath8 approximates well the true coulomb one @xmath9 for distances @xmath10 smaller than the screening radius @xmath11 and simultaneously vanishes rapidly for @xmath12 , providing a comparatively fast convergence of the partial - wave expansion .",
    "in contrast , the sharp cutoff @xmath13 yields an unpleasant oscillatory behavior in the momentum - space representation , leading to convergence problems . in refs .",
    "@xcite we found the values @xmath14 to provide a sufficiently smooth , but at the same time a sufficiently rapid screening around @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is our choice also in the present paper .",
    "we solve alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) three - particle scattering equations  @xcite in momentum space    [ eq : ags ] @xmath17    with @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the free resolvent , @xmath20 the two - particle transition matrix derived from nuclear plus screened coulomb potentials , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 the three - particle transition operators for elastic / rearrangement and breakup scattering ; their dependence on the screening radius @xmath11 is notationally indicated .",
    "on - shell matrix elements of the operators between two- and- three - body channel states @xmath23 and @xmath24 with discrete quantum numbers @xmath25 , jacobi momenta @xmath26 and @xmath27 , energy @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , do not have a @xmath30 limit . however , as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the three - particle amplitudes can be decomposed into long - range and coulomb - distorted short - range parts , where the quantities diverging in that limit are of two - body nature , i.e. , the on - shell transition matrix @xmath31 derived from the screened coulomb potential between spectator and the center of mass ( c.m . ) of the bound pair , the corresponding wave function , and the screened coulomb wave function for the relative motion of two charged particles in the final state . those quantities ,",

    "has to be calculated numerically , but due to the short - range nature of the corresponding operators it is reached with sufficient accuracy at rather modest @xmath11 if the form of the screened coulomb potential has been chosen successfully as discussed above .",
    "more details on the practical implementation of the screening and renormalization approach are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . compared to the @xmath36 calculations an additional difficulty is the presence of the @xmath37 @xmath38-wave transition matrix @xmath20 poles in the complex energy plane close to the real axis .",
    "this requires special treatment of those partial waves in the numerical solution of eqs .",
    ", i.e. , the pole factor of @xmath20 is separated when interpolating @xmath39 and the subtraction technique is used for integration .",
    "there exist in the literature several parametrizations of the @xmath5 potential .",
    "most of them support deeply bound @xmath5 state in @xmath40-wave that is not observed experimentally , since it is forbidden by the pauli principle .",
    "to account for the pauli principle that forbidden state @xmath41 ( or some state close to it ) has to be projected out or moved to a large positive energy @xmath42 , replacing the potential @xmath43 by @xmath44 . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the latter method in the @xmath45 limit is equivalent to the first one . alternatively , one may use repulsive @xmath5 potential in the @xmath40-wave . in order to estimate the model dependence , in the calculations of this paper we use three different parametrizations for the nuclear part of the @xmath5 potential , that in the following will be called @xmath5-i , @xmath5-ii , and @xmath5-iii .",
    "the potential @xmath5-i is taken from ref .",
    "it is of woods - saxon form with central and spin - orbit parts and supports a bound - state in @xmath40-wave that is moved to a large positive energy @xmath42 ; we found that for @xmath46 mev the results are practically independent of @xmath42 .",
    "the potential @xmath5-ii is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite as well and differs from @xmath5-i only in @xmath40-wave where it is repulsive and local , but , nevertheless , nearly phase equivalent to @xmath5-i .",
    "the third potential @xmath5-iii , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , is represented as a sum of gaussians with the strong repulsive rank-1 separable term in @xmath40-wave that moves the harmonic oscillator ground state which is close to the pauli - forbidden state to @xmath47 mev .",
    "the potentials fit the low energy experimental @xmath5 phase shifts quite well , although @xmath5-iii is more attractive in @xmath38-waves than the other two .",
    "all potentials are charge symmetric and act in partial waves with orbital angular momentum @xmath48 . for the neutron - proton @xmath49 interaction",
    "we use the charge dependent ( cd ) bonn potential @xcite and include partial waves with total angular momentum @xmath50 plus @xmath51 .",
    "it was checked that those quite low partial waves are sufficient for convergence .",
    "in contrast , the screened coulomb potential is of longer range and therefore , depending on the screening radius @xmath11 , requires partial waves up to @xmath52 . those high partial waves are included exactly as described in ref .",
    "we note that the @xmath53 coulomb potential at short distances is taken as the one of a uniformly charged sphere , i.e. , @xmath54/(2r_i)$ ] for @xmath55 , @xmath56 being the fine structure constant .",

    "results without coulomb ( dashed curves ) are given as reference for the size of the coulomb effect .",
    "the calculations were performed with the @xmath5-i potential . ]",
    "the internal criterion for the reliability of the screening and renormalization approach is the convergence of the observables with the screening radius @xmath11 employed to calculate the coulomb - distorted short - range part of the amplitudes in eqs .  ; that criterion was found to be absolutely reliable for @xmath36 scattering @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : relastic ] and [ fig : rbreakup ] show several examples for @xmath3 elastic scattering and breakup .",
    "the breakup kinematical final - state configurations are characterized in a standard way by the polar angles of the @xmath0-particle and the proton and by the azimuthal angle between them , @xmath62 .",
    "the definition of the arclength @xmath40 along the kinematical curve is the standard one as in refs .",
    "even when the coulomb effect is large the convergence is impressively fast , e.g. , the screening radius @xmath63 is practically sufficient for the elastic @xmath3 scattering at 4.81  mev deuteron lab energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : relastic ] , while the observables of @xmath3 breakup at 15  mev @xmath0 lab energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbreakup ] require at least @xmath64 for convergence . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the convergence rate is energy dependent , i.e. , larger screening radii are needed for elastic scattering observables at very low energies and for the breakup differential cross section in kinematical situations characterized by very low relative energy of the two charged particles , i.e. , close to the @xmath53 final - state interaction ( fsi ) regime .",
    "nevertheless , the observed convergence strongly suggests the reliability of the present coulomb treatment using screening and renormalization approach .    as already shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : relastic ] and [ fig : rbreakup ] the coulomb effect on the observables of low energy @xmath3 scattering may be very strong , indicating that the inclusion of the coulomb interaction is necessary for a stringent comparison of the theoretical results and experimental data . obviously , we have many more predictions than it is possible to show",
    ". therefore we make a selection of the most interesting predictions which illustrate the message we believe the results tell us .",
    "the readers are welcome to obtain the results for their favorite data from us .        figure  [ fig : elastic ] presents our results for the differential cross section and all deuteron analyzing powers of elastic @xmath3 scattering at 4.81 mev and 17 mev deuteron lab energy .",
    "as expected , the coulomb effect is large at lower energy for all observables in the whole angular regime , while with increasing energy it becomes smaller .",
    "furthermore , the results depend strongly on the choice of the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the potential @xmath5-i describes most of the experimental @xmath65 mev data quite satisfactorily , whereas the potential @xmath5-ii that avoids the pauli forbidden state in @xmath40-wave by the local repulsion clearly fails in accounting for the scattering data , especially at @xmath66 mev , although the @xmath67 bound state properties predicted by both potentials are very similar .",
    "the potential @xmath5-iii also fails in accounting for the experimental data at @xmath65 mev , but the difference between predictions using @xmath5-i and @xmath5-iii is found to be mostly due to the differences in @xmath38-waves . at @xmath66 mev , which is just 3 mev below @xmath68 threshold , there is a qualitative agreement between experimental data and predictions with @xmath5-i and @xmath5-iii , except for deuteron tensor analyzing powers @xmath58 and @xmath69 .",
    "obviously , the treatment of the @xmath0-particle as a structureless boson becomes less reliable with increasing energy .",
    "figure [ fig : breakup ] presents our results for the differential cross section of @xmath3 breakup at 15  mev @xmath0 lab energy in various kinematical configurations .",
    "the most important coulomb effect is the shift of the @xmath53 @xmath38-wave resonance position that leads to the corresponding changes in the structure of the observables .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb interaction breaks @xmath70 charge symmetry and thereby allows the coupling to the @xmath71 isospin triplet waves , in particular @xmath72 .",
    "the predictions without coulomb fail completely in accounting for the experimental data , while inclusion of the coulomb moves the peaks of the differential cross section to the right positions , although the height of those peaks is not always reproduced .",
    "there is a strong dependence on the employed @xmath5 potential , where , like in the elastic scattering , the potential @xmath5-ii provides the worst description of the data , and the difference between the predictions of @xmath5-i and @xmath5-iii is dominated by the @xmath38-waves .",
    "the sensitivity of the results to the choice of a realistic @xmath71 potential is also checked and found to be insignificant . when the c.m .",
    "energy increases one finds a larger part of the phase space where the relative @xmath53 energy may be quite different from the one corresponding to the @xmath38-wave resonance and therefore also the coulomb effect is less significant as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : breakup12 ] .",
    "in this paper we show that the screening and renormalization approach for the inclusion of the coulomb interaction in the description of three - particle scattering using momentum - space integral equations , developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath36 reactions , can be extended reliably to @xmath3 scattering .",
    "this is an important step towards application of exact scattering equations for the description of nuclear reactions within three - body models , where up to now only approximate treatments like the cdcc method @xcite have been used .",
    "the coulomb effect on the observables of @xmath3 scattering is studied and is found to be large in elastic scattering at very low energies and in breakup , where the shift of @xmath53 @xmath38-wave resonance position leads to the corresponding shifts of the differential cross section peaks .",
    "another important consequence of this work is that it allows to ascertain with greater confidence the quality of the @xmath5 force models one uses to describe @xmath3 observables as well as structure and reactions of @xmath67 and @xmath73 .",
    "although at present there are too large uncertainties in the parametrization of @xmath38- and @xmath74-wave interactions that need to be improved , this work clearly indicates the superiority of the attractive @xmath40-wave potentials supporting a pauli - forbidden state ( that is projected out or moved to a large positive energy ) over the repulsive @xmath40-wave potentials .",
