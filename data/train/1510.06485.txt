    "the study of nonlinear dispersive equations strives to understand the large time behavior of generic solutions to such equations .",
    "this quest is further aided by the _ soliton resolution conjecture _ : asymptotic states should in general consist of free waves ( solutions to the linear homogenous equations ) , and independently moving solitons or other types of stable coherent structures .",
    "however , for the generic circumstances there are also _ unstable _ solitons . these unstable solitons or coherent structures may contribute to the final state .",
    "the first complete analysis of such a problem , was given in @xcite .",
    "together with the modulation equations approach in @xcite , it was shown that the excited states of the klein - gordon equation and schrdinger equation with attractive potentials in 3 dimensions are unstable when considering nonlinear perturbations .",
    "this instability would result in a metastable state for the asymptotic behavior .",
    "more detailed analysis shows that , under an assumption of a nonlinear fermi golden rule , the decay rate of this metastable state is very slow .",
    "an upper bound @xmath0 for this anomalous slow decay rate was proved . and",
    "this decay rate is not integrable .",
    "the metastable state also acts as a slow source term in the radiation equations .",
    "consequently , in @xcite it was shown that the radiation fields decaying like @xmath3 , in the @xmath4 norm .",
    "this is not the optimal decay rate as for a free wave .",
    "there are many other interesting progresses made on fermi golden rule for klein - gordon equation and schrdinger equation .",
    "one could find the recent developments in @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite and the references therein .",
    "+ in this paper , we will first derive an asymptotic behavior ( including lower bound ) for the solutions in @xcite and study _",
    "asymptotic completeness _ in @xmath2 norms .",
    "+ we consider the following a nonlinear klein - gordon equation ( nlkg ) :    @xmath5    @xmath6    in @xcite , soffer and weinstein proved the following result    [ thm1.1 ] let @xmath7 be real - valued and such that    * ( v1 ) for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , * ( v2 ) @xmath11 is bounded on @xmath12 + for @xmath13 with @xmath14 . * ( v3 ) zero is not a resonance of the operator @xmath15 .",
    "assume the operator @xmath16 has continuous spectrum , @xmath17 , and a unique strictly positive simple eigenvalue , @xmath18 with associated normalized eigenfunction , @xmath19 : @xmath20    assume the resonance condition ( _ fermi golden rule _ ) @xmath21    here , @xmath22 denotes the projection onto the continuous spectral part of @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the fourier transform relative to the continuous spectral part of @xmath23 .",
    "assume that the initial data @xmath25 are such that the norm @xmath26 and @xmath27 are sufficiently small .",
    "then , the solution of the initial value problem for ( [ 1.1 ] ) , with @xmath28 decays as @xmath1 .",
    "then solution @xmath29 has the following expansion as @xmath1 :    @xmath30    where @xmath31    @xmath32      the main theorems of this paper are    [ thm1.2 ] under the same assumption of theorem [ thm1.1 ] , we have    @xmath33    [ thm1.3 ] under the same assumption of theorem [ thm1.1 ] , there exist @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that as @xmath1    @xmath36    * remark : * since @xmath37 as @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we also prove    ( asymptotic completeness)[thm1.4 ] under the same assumption of theorem [ thm1.1 ] , for solution @xmath38 in ( [ solu ] ) , there exist @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that as @xmath1    @xmath39    asymptotic completeness is hence verified for this case . +",
    "* remark : * for simplicity , in the following parts of this paper , for @xmath40 we use @xmath41 to denote @xmath42 .",
    "+ therefore , theorem [ thm1.3 ] and theorem [ thm1.4 ] tell us that the dispersive part of the solution is asymptotically a free wave with some initial state @xmath43 . for the radiation part @xmath44",
    ", we have @xmath45 converges to zero in the @xmath2 norm . here",
    "@xmath46 is the wave operator .",
    "+      to prove theorems [ thm1.2]-[thm1.4 ] , we would expect some difficulties .",
    "it is natural to ask    * question 1 : how to show the lower bound for @xmath47 as in ( [ eqn1.9 ] ) ? *",
    "question 2 : we have @xmath48 from @xcite . but",
    "how to explore the detailed structures for @xmath49 in @xmath2 as in ( [ eqn1.10 ] ) ?",
    "+      to derive a lower bound for @xmath47 , we use polar coordinates and introduce a new ode approach in section 3 . under the ansatz ( [ solu ] ) , @xmath47 would satisfy an ode : @xmath50    here @xmath51 are some positive integers ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 are real numbers . and @xmath54 is due to fermi golden rule ( [ 1.5 ] ) .",
    "this equation implies @xmath55    in theorem [ thm1.2 ] , we hope to prove @xmath56 for @xmath57 large .",
    "this would give both lower and upper bounds for @xmath47 .",
    "hence we only need to show that , on the right hand side of ( [ eqn1.13 ] ) , the first term @xmath58 dominates .    luckily , for @xmath59 we have @xmath60 when @xmath57 is large , the second and third terms @xmath61 and @xmath62 are like constants .",
    "they are much smaller than the first term .    to deal with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we could use integration by part and employ the same method as for the second and third terms .",
    "however , we encounter an additional difficulty : since in @xcite a lower bound for @xmath47 has not been proved , we can not rule out the possibility that @xmath47 decays faster than @xmath0 . and this would make @xmath65 out of control .    to overcome this difficulty , we construct a parametrix @xmath66 in section 4 through    @xmath67    one can check @xmath68 satisfies :    @xmath69    then we introduce the unknown @xmath70 through @xmath71    for initial data , we have @xmath72 . therefore , the seeking of lower bound for @xmath47 is reduced to close a bootstrap argument for @xmath73 and to show that @xmath73 is small for all the time . and",
    "this is proved in section 5 .",
    "+      after deriving the asymptotic behavior for @xmath47 , we move to analyze the radiation field @xmath49 in @xmath2 norm .    for @xmath44 , we have    @xmath74    where @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    here @xmath78 .",
    "let s first focus on @xmath79 . from ( [ eqn1.17 ] )",
    ", we have    @xmath80    if we only use @xmath81 and the standard dispersive estimates for wave operator ( see theorem 2.1 in @xcite ) , we can not even prove that @xmath82 for all @xmath83 .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by constructing an auxiliary function @xmath84 through solving    @xmath85    hence @xmath86    thus , @xmath87 and @xmath88    define @xmath89    since @xmath23 is a self - adjoint operator , a simple calculation ( see details in section 6 ) implies    @xmath90    using the definitions of @xmath91 , together with the dispersive estimates for @xmath23 ( see theorem 2.1 in @xcite ) and the fact @xmath92 , we derive @xmath93    with the estimate above , we arrive at @xmath94    therefore , we have proved    @xmath95    @xmath96    for any @xmath97 . since @xmath98 is a bounded operator for @xmath2 , we deduce    @xmath99    in order to prove theorem [ thm1.3 ] and theorem [ thm1.4 ] , it requires more detailed analysis for @xmath79 and @xmath100 in @xmath2 norms . and",
    "we will show all the details in section 6 .      for the readers familiar with scattering theory",
    ", we hope to point out that there is some important difference between in our case and in standard scattering theory .",
    "our scattering state @xmath43",
    "is highly delocalized in space , even for the smooth and exponentially decaying initial data .",
    "in fact , @xmath43 is not in any @xmath101 space , for @xmath102 , for some @xmath103    we could see this by considering the leading contribution to the scattered waves .",
    "the leading term @xmath104 comes from the solution to the following non - homogeneous equation with zero initial data conditions : @xmath105 here @xmath106 is a smooth and exponentially decaying function for @xmath107 and @xmath108 is a phase function .",
    "the solution is then give by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the propagator for linear klein - gordon equation in three dimensions .",
    "this operator can be written in terms of exponential functions of the operator @xmath111 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the leading contribution to the solution @xmath104 is coming from the sine and cosine transform of the function @xmath3 , evaluated at the point @xmath112 .",
    "the resulting function is a combination of the special bessel functions , with leading singular term at the origin of order @xmath113 .",
    "hence , the scattering state for late stage free wave has a leading behavior given by : @xmath114",
    "therefore , in general , the scattering wave operator is not bounded on @xmath101 for systems with metastable states @xcite . + * remark : * although the proof we will present below relies heavily on the upper bounds derived in @xcite , here we introduce some changes to the general algorithm .",
    "in particular , we introduce a method to study the late stage behaviors ( for the ode part ) directly without appealing to normal form transformation .",
    "together with constructing and employing parametrix and auxiliary functions , we derive the precise asymptotic behaviors for solutions to nlkg . in principle",
    ", the approach we develop here can be used as an alternative method to derive both upper bounds ( as in @xcite ) and lower bounds .",
    "for small amplitude solutions to ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) , it is natural to decompose the solution as follows :    @xmath115    @xmath116    where @xmath117 denotes the usual complex inner product in @xmath2 .",
