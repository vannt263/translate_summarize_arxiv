    "the bright visual binary 85  peg ( hd 224930 ) has been the object of numerous studies since the time of its discovery by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy revealed a metal deficient object and astrometry moderately high space velocity components @xcite , both suggesting a classification as subdwarf and a probable old age .",
    "its orbital elements are known with good approximation since a long time , and recent determinations , made through very precise astrometric , photometric and spectroscopic measurements ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , have not substantially changed what has been known for more than one century nor have been able to solve the problem of the masses of the stars that constitute 85  peg . indeed , while it seems evident that , making the reasonable hypothesis of a common origin , the secondary star should have a considerably smaller mass than the primary , due to the about three magnitudes of difference , the masses determined dynamically are similar . this discrepancy has been ascribed to a third much fainter component @xcite . in this situation",
    "the determination of the two masses has been committed up to now to theoretical calibrations by modeling stellar parameters ( fernandes et al .",
    "1998 , fernandes , morel & lebreton 2002 ) on the basis of observational data and of assumptions on age , initial helium content and metallicity .",
    "this leaves broad intervals of discretionality which , coupled with the uncertainty in the theoretical models , lead to rather different determinations of mass and consequently of age . the determination of the age of subdwarfs sets a lower limit to the age of old galactic stars , possibly significant as lower limit for the age of the galaxy .",
    "recently , a new tool has become available to infer the evolutionary status and the structural properties of a star , asteroseismology . during the last years",
    ", numerous attempts have been made with the aim of identifying oscillations in distant stars and also of modeling the stellar pulsational phenomena .",
    "it is now clear , indeed , that oscillations have several advantages over all the other observables : pulsational instability has been detected in stars in all the evolutionary stages and of different spectral type ; frequencies of oscillations can be measured with high accuracy and depend in very simple way on the equilibrium structure of the model ; different modes are spatially confined and probe different layers of the stellar interior .",
    "85  peg  a can be considered as a good candidate for asteroseismic studies , since theory predicts a detectable surface amplitude of oscillations with a maximum value of @xmath0 cm  s@xmath1 according to the scaling law of @xcite and a mean value of @xmath2 cm  s@xmath1 ( houdek private communication ) obtained according to the theoretical simulation of modes stochastically driven by convection @xcite .",
    "85  peg  a , indeed , is listed as target for asteroseismic observations by most @xcite , the first satellite totally dedicated to the observation of pulsating stars from space .    the aim of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive theoretical study of the system .",
    "we will use new theoretical evolution models to find a correspondence between the observed data and the derived astrophysical parameters , in order to locate 85  peg  a in an evolutionary context .",
    "we will discuss the possibility of discriminating among its possible structure models by means of the oscillation data which will be soon available .",
    "a summary of known data on 85  peg is presented in section [ thorn ] , the details of the evolutionary models and their result in sections [ models ]  [ 85peg ] , the computations of the oscillation frequencies and a discussion of the results in section [ puls ] and [ oscill ] , which is followed by the final conclusions .",
    "the visual and single - lined spectroscopic binary 85  peg is a bright ( v=5.75 ) , and nearby ( @xmath3 pc ) system with an orbital period of 26.31 yr @xcite .",
    "its small angular separation ( @xmath4 ) and the marked magnitude difference between the components , @xmath5 mag in v @xcite , makes it a difficult target both for visual and spectroscopic observations .",
    "the primary component is a metal deficient g5 subdwarf @xcite , while the most - of - the - time unresolvable secondary is supposed to be , on the basis of the @xmath6 value , a k6-k8 dwarf .",
    "the classification as subdwarf is based both on the space velocity component values and on its metallicity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively @xmath7}=-0.88 $ ] and @xmath8 ) . more recently @xcite found a smaller deficit , @xmath9=-0.7 $ ] , which at any rate places it at least among old disk stars . according to @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath10elements are enhanced by a factor @xmath112 with respect to solar scaled abundances .    an excellent summary and",
    "a critical analysis of the dynamical data , collected over more than a century , has been recently published by @xcite together with a long term radial velocity study , therefore we report here only the strictly necessary information and refer to the quoted paper for a more complete review .",
    "the main updated orbital parameters from various sources are collected in table  [ orbit ] .",

    "[ f7 ] we compare the echelle diagram for model  4 of 85  peg  a with that of a standard solar model having y=0.28 and z=0.02 .",
    "the theoretical echelle diagram of 85  peg  a has been obtained by using the value of @xmath19 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f7 ] obtained for the sun , is drawn for both the theoretical and the observed frequencies by using the value of @xmath18 as a reference frequency and a large separation @xmath20 corresponding to the observed average which can be calculated on mdi / soho frequencies ( schou 1998 ) .",
    "like in the sun , the theoretical echelle diagram of 85  peg  a shows a regular behaviour of the frequencies , indicating no departures from the simple asymptotic expression .",
    "in addition , it is likely that the observed oscillation spectrum of 85  peg  a will not show presence of g modes nor of mixed modes .",
    "in fact , our theoretical calculation shows that g modes are well confined in the core and with an amplitude which is too shallow to be detected at the surface .",
    "it is important to notice that the observed solar data at high frequencies deviates from the model predictions .",
    "this is a consequence of a not fully adequate treatment of the surface layers ( see sec .",
    "[ subsur ] ) . therefore this behaviour",
    "is also expected for 85  peg  a which is , like the sun , a low effective temperature star .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the problem of studying the structural properties and identifying the evolutionary state of 85  peg  a. the location in the h - r diagram indicates that this star is in the main - sequence phase of evolution , with a mass in the range = 0.75 - 0.82  and with an age which can vary from 8 to 14  gyr .",
    "these values have been obtained by assuming the most recent observational parameters of temperature and luminosity , but the classical method of fitting the stellar modeling parameters to the observational data does not allow to reduce the uncertainty on age and mass .",
    "here we have shown that the problem of determining the evolutionary state of 85  peg  a will be solved once observations of the oscillation spectrum will be available for this star .",
    "theoretical calculation of models and p mode oscillations have shown that 85  peg  a is a solar - like star , which is expected to oscillate in the range of frequencies @xmath21 .",
    "our results show that its oscillation spectrum seem to be characterized by a large separation for @xmath22 of about @xmath23 and a small separation between @xmath22 and @xmath13 which can vary from about @xmath24 to @xmath25 , according to the evolutionary state of the star .",
    "indeed a difference of about 2  gyr corresponds , in the asymptotic regime and hence at high frequencies , to a difference in @xmath26 of about @xmath27 and in the ratio @xmath28 of about @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "it can be concluded that a determination of frequencies with an uncertainty @xmath30 , which corresponds to an average error of @xmath31 in the ratio @xmath28 , is sufficient to determine the age with an uncertainty better than 2  gyr .",
    "our work has examined the role of the most important physical inputs ( metallicity , convection and diffusion processes ) in the framework of the inputs of our evolutionary code .",
    "we have studied the influence of metal diffusion with the help of the cles evolutionary code , which differs from ours in some physical inputs ( e.g. nuclear reaction rates , treatment of helium diffusion , atmospheric boundary conditions , convection modelling ) .",
    "we therefore did not perform an accurate comparison of the codes , but simply have shown that the inclusion of metal diffusion has not an important impact on the age determination . anyway",
    ", the change in metallicity implied by the @xcite description of metal diffusion is relatively modest ( @xmath32% ) in 12  gyr , while fml02 find a reduction of metallicity by more than a factor 2 in @xmath33  gyr .",
    "this difference is taken by us as an indication that really much has to be done in the understanding of this issue .",
    "we believe that this star should be considered as primary target for space or ground - based observations .",
    "it is clear indeed that only accurate observations will allow investigation of the properties of the interior of this star and discrimination of its accurate evolutionary stage .",
    "the oscillation spectrum of 85  peg  a will reveal how old is the star in terms of core hydrogen consumption , thanks to the very good mass constraint coming from the astrometric and spectroscopic observations . in this respect",
    ", it appears feasible to put a lower limit to the age of the galaxy based on the asteroseismology of 85  peg  a.",
    "the authors are very grateful to g. houdek for having contributed to the paper with new computations of the amplitude of the oscillations of 85 peg a. we are also grateful to the anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions which led to the improvement of the present paper .",
