    "the concept of entropy is fundamental for many branches of physics and other sciences dealing with systems which reveal a certain degree of complexity and disorder .",
    "as stressed in the monograph @xcite ,  entropy is not a single concept but rather a family of notions \" .",
    "this monograph and the earlier review article @xcite contain historical information and give many examples of different approaches to the idea of entropy and numerous applications .    in relation to quantum theory ,",
    "the mainstream of development is formed by four main overlapping lines .",
    "they can be referred to as thermodynamical ( boltzmann - gibbs ) entropy , quantum ensemble ( von neumann ) entropy , information ( shannon ) entropy and dynamical ( kolmogorov - sinai ) entropy .",
    "since the general description of a quantum system , including its interaction with the environment , time development and relaxation to equilibrium , can be given in terms of the density matrix @xcite , the von neumann definition seems to be the most fundamental . for a system in an equilibrium with a heat bath , the density matrix ( and , accordingly , von neumann entropy ) is eqivalent to that in the canonical or grand canonical thermal ensemble .",
    "the evolution of a closed quantum many body ( gas - like ) system from a random initial state is shown @xcite to lead to the same values of macroscopic observables as for the thermal equilibrium described by the microcanonical ensemble which has a clear semiclassical limit as the equipopulation on the energy surface in phase space .",
    "the ensemble entropy can not be represented as an expectation value of a dynamic variable expressed by an operator in hilbert space . however , being a trace functional of the density matrix , it is invariant under unitary basis transformations . for a pure wave function , as that of a stationary state in an isolated system , basis - independent",
    "von neumann entropy vanishes .",
    "it reflects the mixed character of the quantum state with incomplete information .",
    "information entropy , with traditional applications in communication theory , is expressed in terms of probabilities rather than amplitudes .",
    "therefore it is representation dependent being different for different choices of the set of mutually excluding events . in quantum systems",
    ", one can find information entropy of individual eigenstates with respect to a specific basis .",
    "all correlations between the amplitudes of different components of the wave function are suppressed in this definition .",
    "averaging information entropy over some ensemble of quantum states , one gets a measure of average complexity of those states . at this stage",
    ", the similarity between information entropy and von neumann ensemble entropy can emerge if one can establish an appropriate correspondence between the ensembles used in the two approaches and the basis utilized in calculating information entropy @xcite .",
    "thus , for canonical equilibrium thermal ensembles , the correlations are destroyed by the random interaction with the heat bath so that the density matrix is diagonal in the energy representation for the system . in this case , the eigenvalues of the density matrix give the occupancies of the stationary eigenstates of the isolated system which could be directly used for constructing information (= thermodynamical ) entropy @xcite .",
    "the so - called dynamical entropy , extensively studied during the last decade @xcite , is essentially information entropy applied to a random sequence of measurements of quantum observables .",
    "apart from the intrinsic complexity of the system under study , this construction reflects special features of the quantum measurement process .",
    "this entropy depends not only on the initial state but , in addition , on the observable and on the way of performing the measurement .",
    "it can be defined so that it give classical kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xcite in the corresponding limit of fine - grained phase space when the sequence of measurements may be described with the aid of symbolic dynamics @xcite .",
    "information entropy used as a tool for quantifying the degree of complexity of individual quantum states @xcite shows delocalization of the wave function in a given basis . however , as a rule one can find a basis , or a family of bases , which are singled out by physical arguments specific for each system .",
    "the delocalization length in such a representation manifests complex character of the state and can be quantitatively related to other signatures of quantum chaos .",
    "this exceptional role is naturally played by the coordinate representation in billiard - like cases @xcite and by the quasienergy basis in the problems with a periodic perturbation @xcite . for realistic many - body systems with strong interaction between constituents ,",
    "the mean field represents the exceptional basis where the local correlations and fluctuations of adjacent stationary states are separated from their regular evolution along the spectrum @xcite .    as shown in large scale nuclear shell model calculations",
    "@xcite , the representation dependence of information entropy might be considered in some respects as an advantage which provides a useful physical measure of mutual relationship between the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian and the representation basis .",
    "moreover , chaotic dynamics make different states with close excitation energy and the same values of exact constants of motion ",
    "look the same \" @xcite , i.e. have similar observable properties .",
    "this is nothing but a microscopic picture of thermal equilibrium @xcite . after averaging over a narrow energy window in a high level density region ,",
    "information entropy in the mean field basis becomes a smooth function of excitation energy and carries @xcite the same thermodynamic contents as thermal entropy found for the microcanonical distribution from the level density .",
    "being calculated in a random basis , the magnitude of information entropy of generic states in a complex system is typically on the level predicted by random matrix theory and does not display any regular evolution along the spectrum .    the goal of the present paper is to explore the possibility of describing the degree of complexity of individual quantum states using the von neumann definition of entropy and applying an external noise which converts a pure state into the mixed one .",
    "we do not consider the perturbation to be weak ; therefore the resulting mixed state depends explicitly on the noise properties and gives a description of the ensemble  system plus noise \" .",
    "there exists a vast literature discussing the behavior of regular and chaotic systems under the change of parameters of the hamiltonian , see for example @xcite .",
    "multiple avoided crossings of the energy terms in a function of parameters reveal strong mixing and drive the system to the chaotic limit .",
    "the analogy of level dynamics with that of the one - dimensional gas of colliding particles is very productive for studying the spectral statistics @xcite .",
    "here we assume that the ensemble of the parameter values is defined by a distribution function and calculate the density matrix and von neumann entropy for a given energy term .",
    "using exactly solvable models , we show essential features of representation - independent entropy obtained according to this definition , its similarity to and distinction from information entropy . even for the simplest systems as a harmonic oscillator in a random uniform field , the resulting steady states are far from trivial .",
    "we also give an example of a realistic numerical calculation for a many - body system of fermions ( a nucleus @xmath3 mg ) which shows that our ensemble entropy (  correlational \" entropy ) is a smooth function of excitation energy and therefore may be used as a measure of the degree of complexity .",
    "we consider a quantum system interacting with a surrounding .",
    "the interaction will be parameterized by a set of real parameters @xmath4 in the hamiltonian , @xmath5 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the system is assumed to be discrete .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath6 of the system , as well as its energy levels @xmath7 , evolve with @xmath4 . for a complicated system ,",
    "the level crossings are avoided so one can continuously follow these energy terms .    at a fixed value of @xmath4",
    ", one can use any complete orthonormal basis @xmath8 to study the evolution of the eigenstates in terms of the amplitudes @xmath9 , @xmath10 instead of the wave function ( [ 1 ] ) , one can also use the density matrix @xmath11 whose elements are @xmath12 @xmath11 is a hermitian matrix in hilbert space of the system .",
    "for a pure state @xmath13 , the descriptions in terms of the wave function ( [ 1 ] ) and the density matrix ( [ 2 ] ) are fully equivalent . the obvious properties of the density matrix ( [ 2 ] ) are the normalization @xmath14 and the matrix identity @xmath15 which shows that the eigenvalues of this matrix can be only 0 or 1 .",
    "actually , the density matrix ( [ 2 ] ) is diagonalized in the eigenbasis @xmath16 .",
    "only one eigenvalue , for the original state @xmath17 , is equal to 1 while the rest of the eigenstates belong to the degenerate subspace with the zero eigenvalues of @xmath18 so that @xmath18 is the projection operator onto the state @xmath13 .",
    "inversely , these properties can be taken as a signature of a density matrix describing a pure state .",
    "now we assume that the interaction parameters @xmath4 are random and have to be considered as members of an ensemble characterized by the normalized distribution function @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "then the description in terms of a wave function becomes impossible , and our system is described by the density matrix ( here and below the overline refers to ensemble averaged quantities ) @xmath21 this is still a hermitian matrix with trace equal to 1 .",
    "but , generally , the operator identity ( [ 4 ] ) is not valid anymore .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath22 of the matrix ( [ 5 ] ) , @xmath23 are nonnegative numbers between 0 and 1 , @xmath24 these eigenvalues can be interpreted as mean occupation numbers of the eigenstates @xmath25 for a system which was brought into the contact with an external source being originally in the intrinsic state @xmath26 .",
    "the exceptional case of a pure wave function is recovered for a fixed parameter , @xmath27 . in notations of eq .",
    "( [ 5a ] ) and later on we distinguish the eigenstates @xmath25 of the density matrix from the eigenstates @xmath26 of the hamiltonian by using the parentheses and the angular brackets , respectively ; the dimensions of both sets are equal .",
    "the statistical distribution of occupancies can be characterized by von neumann entropy @xmath28 this entropy , being still attributed to a single original energy term @xmath26 , reflects correlational properties of the system subject to different levels of noise . therefore we will call it _ correlational entropy _ although the definition ( [ 7 ] ) is quite similar to that of standard thermodynamic entropy in canonical thermal ensembles @xcite .",
    "in contrast to information entropy of a given complicated state in a fixed basis @xmath8 , which was used in the studies of quantum chaos @xcite , @xmath29 correlational entropy ( [ 7 ] ) is invariant and does not depend on the original basis @xmath30 of simple configurations .",
    "obviously , this is a consequence of correlations between different components of the eigenfunction which are absent in the probabilistic definition of eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) .    for a pure quantum state @xmath13 ,",
    "correlational entropy vanishes independently of the degree of complexity of the system .",
    "thus , @xmath31 characterizes the intrinsic term @xmath26 as a member of the statistical ensemble . in general",
    ", @xmath31 has an order of magnitude of @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a number of the eigenstates @xmath25 which have the occupancies @xmath22 noticeably different from zero .",
    "the maximum possible value of correlational entropy is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dimension of hilbert space .",
    "this value would correspond to the  microcanonical \" density matrix , @xmath36 .",
    "note that the information entropy @xcite has the order of magnitude of @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a number of essential components in the stationary wave function @xmath13 expressed in an original basis which was used in the definition of information entropy .",
    "although formally the maximum value of information entropy is also @xmath34 , its typical value in the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random real symmetric hamiltonians stays , due to the fluctuations , on the level of @xmath39 , see @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , correlational entropy shows the degree of mixing , or decoherence , introduced by a given source of noise , regardless of the relationship between the resulting state and the original unperturbed basis .    in next two sections we consider simple examples which allow us to obtain exact solutions and shed some light on main properties and physical meaning of new entropy .",
    "we start with the case of a narrow noise range @xmath40 that is small as compared to the scale of the parameter values which would lead to a considerable change of the wave functions .",
    "this is the perturbative regime .",
    "we can assume that the distribution function @xmath19 is concentrated near @xmath41 and find the perturbed wave function which starts its evolution for @xmath42 from the unperturbed state @xmath43 .",
    "the state @xmath43 acquires the admixtures of states @xmath44 which are given by standard perturbation theory ( we assume the absence of degeneracy ) .    with the hamiltonian @xmath45 where the perturbation @xmath46 is an off - diagonal operator in the eigenbasis of @xmath47 , the density matrix ( [ 5 ] ) of the state @xmath43 is , up to the second order in @xmath4 , @xmath48 @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the mean values over an ensemble of noise , and the notation @xmath52 is used for the energy denominators .",
    "the density matrix ( [ 7b ] ) incorporates two effects , the redefinition of the original wave function @xmath43 due to the perturbation @xmath53 , and the transition from the pure state to the density matrix .",
    "the first effect is the only one if the perturbation is fixed while the second effect appears because of the ensemble distribution of perturbations .",
    "it is easy to see that the first order correction to the density matrix does not change the purity condition ( [ 4 ] ) , @xmath54 .",
    "the decoherence occurs only in the second order",
    ". the diagonalization problem ( [ 5a ] ) for the matrix ( [ 7b ] ) can be solved to give , within a needed accuracy , two nonvanishing eigenvalues @xmath55 as the roots of the characteristic equation @xmath56 and @xmath57 zero eigenvalues .",
    "as expected , the statistical mixing is driven by the mean square fluctuation @xmath58 of the noise level .",

    "the high order perturbative corrections consequentially lift the remaining isotropy populating new combinations of original states",
