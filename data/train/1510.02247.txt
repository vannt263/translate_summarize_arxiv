    "thermoresponsive polymers can strongly respond to chemical and physical stimuli in their environment and have been therefore heavily investigated recently for their use as smart and adaptable functional materials .",
    "@xcite if the stimulus is strong enough or the system is close to its critical solution temperature ( cst ) , a volume phase transition of the polymer is triggered that significantly alters all physicochemical properties of the material .",
    "for this reason , the application of thermosensitive polymers is explored , for example , in the field of sensors , @xcite separation and filtration systems ,  @xcite as well as drug carriers and tissue engineering .",
    "@xcite it is therefore of high interest to be able to tailor the cst according to the needs of the desired application .",
    "it is well known that the cst can be tuned by statistical copolymerization , i.e. , by replacing monomers of a homopolymer by a second monomer type in a random , or statistically repeated fashion .",
    "the cst has been observed then to depend either monotonically  @xcite or non - monotonically @xcite on the degree of copolymerization . in the typical scenario of a lower cst ( lcst ) in aqueous solvents , monotonic trends",
    "are often qualitatively explained by the degree of hydrophobicity / philicity of the copolymerizing monomers .",
    "@xcite copolymerizing with hydrophobic monomers leads to a lower lcst  @xcite because the overall hydrophobic attraction increases and leads to a collapse already at lower temperature , while incorporating hydrophilic monomers analogously increases the lcst .",
    "@xcite however , this explanation fails to describe non - monotonic trends in the cst behavior .",
    "the typical theoretical approach to describe critical solution temperatures of polymer systems essentially revolves around extensions of flory - huggins ( fh ) lattice theory ,  @xcite for instance , as frequently applied to copolymer blends .",
    "@xcite noteworthy is here the work of paul and barlow  @xcite who demonstrated that the existence of non - monotonic copolymer miscibility ( miscibility windows ) sensitively depends on the degree of additivity of the monomeric interaction energies between the components . in another line of work",
    "directly applied to the lcst of a thermosensitive copolymer in water , kojima and tanaka  @xcite theoretically explained the nonlinear depression of the lcst of thermosensitive polymers by a combination of fh theory and a microscopic level approach based on cooperative hydration effects .    in a related but different view , the cst for a one - component polymer system in solvent can also be regarded as being signified by a collapse transition ( or coil - to - globule ) of a long , single polymer .",
    "@xcite this perspective is taken in this work .",
    "in contrast to the fh lattice theory , single polymer collapse is typically described within a mean - field flory - de gennes approach .",
    "@xcite in the classical homopolymer case , the free energy @xmath0 of a chain with @xmath1 monomers is the sum of ideal chain entropy @xmath2 and the mean - field monomer interactions expressed by a virial expansion in monomer density @xmath3 , with @xmath4 describing the mean polymer size and @xmath5 the segment length . on the simplest level , the free energy reads  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the second and third virial coefficients of the monomer gas , respectively .",
    "however , this one - component approach seems not be adequate to describe the effects of copolymerization on polymer size as effective virial coefficients are used instead of those distinguishing between the monomer self- and cross - interactions .",
    "supposedly , as in the fh lattice models for polymer blends , therefore both polymer components need to be considered with individual effective pair interactions .",
    "in contrast to fh approach to polymer blends , these interactions are effective for solvated copolymers in the sense that the solvent degrees of freedom are integrated out and their effects are included in the effective potentials .    in the present work ,",
    "we explore copolymerization effects on the collapse transition of a single polymer by coarse - grained , implicit - solvent langevin dynamics computer simulations and a two - component flory - de gennes model . for this",
    ", we use the most generic polymer model in which the polymer is modeled as a freely jointed chain where individual monomers are interacting via a lennard - jones potential .",
    "the degree of copolymerization of a homopolymer with monomer of type a is then expressed in percentage of statistically placed monomers of type b. since we employ temperature - independent effective pair interactions between the monomers , we thus focus on the behavior of the upper cst ( ucst ) .",
    "we first demonstrate that both simulation and flory theory can reproduce all experimental trends . a thermodynamic expansion approach of the transition ( flory ) free energy is employed to interpret the changes of the ucst upon copolymerization based on the dominating monomer pair interactions .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the ucst can then be traced back to non - additive cross - interactions between the monomers , resembling the behavior of miscibility windows in polymer blends .",
    "@xcite this picture is consistent with experimental work on the lcst of thermosensitive polymers , where preferential hydrogen bonding between the unlike nipam and n , n - diethylacrylamide ( deaam ) monomers is reported , and it was pointed out that this is an intramolecular phenomenon , hardly observed for homopolymeric mixtures .",
    "@xcite    we note that our approaches and interpretation should be equally valid , however , for lcst behavior , at least on a qualitative level . in this case ,",
    "temperature - dependent effective pair interactions have to be introduced in the simulations .",
    "hydrophobic interactions lead to more attractive pair potentials with increasing temperature ,  @xcite reflected by @xmath7-values that decrease with rising temperature .",
    "@xcite these effects will drive collapse in both simulation and flory theory for increasing temperature as characteristic for lcst behavior .",
    "if such a pair potential picture is sufficient for a quantitative treatment of the thermodynamics of the collapse transition at the lcst , however , is yet unclear and needs further consideration in future work .",
    "our simulations are based on a generic freely jointed chain model ,  @xcite where copolymers composed of two different monomer species , a and b , are investigated .",
    "the total number of monomers is constant and given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the number of monomers of species a and b , respectively .",

    "the additivity is violated and we employ cross energies @xmath27 that are either smaller or larger than the geometrical mean , while holding the interaction lengths @xmath28 fixed .",
    "chemically , the loosening of the additivity restriction could correspond to a and b monomers that interact similarly among themselves , e.g. , repulsive or only weakly attractive , but more strongly attract the other type .",
    "an example could be donor- and acceptor molecules that preferentially form hydrogen bonds between each other but effectively repel the same of its kind , as realized for n - isopropylacrylamide ( nipam ) and n , n - diethylacrylamide ( deaam ) .",

    "[ fig : r_chi ] , a nonlinear , strongly non - monotonic dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath35 is observed .",
    "this behavior can be understood again by the difference in the virial coeffcients @xmath83 : since @xmath129 now , for a more attractive @xmath130 ( and the negative transition entropy ) , @xmath37 must increase symmetrically with the same slope on both sides , for increasing @xmath35 at @xmath40 , and for decreasing @xmath35 at @xmath15 .",
    "the opposite behavior is seen for a more repulsive @xmath131 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath78 is extremal for @xmath132% , where a maximum of @xmath78 is obtained for @xmath133 and a minimum for @xmath134 .",
    "the maximum or minimum themselves can be increased or decreased by tuning @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we note that similar trends can be expected by introducing non - additivity by @xmath135 as long as the resulting change in @xmath57 versus @xmath55 and @xmath56 is significant .",
    "an example of non - monotonic behavior has been indeed observed experimentally  @xcite where preferential hydrogen bonding between nipam and n , n - diethylacrylamide ( deaam ) monomers is reported .",
    "we note again that for a polymer exhibiting a lcst all trends are expected to be inverse .",
    "in summary , we have explored how the critical temperature @xmath78 ( cst ) changes with statistical copolymerization @xmath35 by exploring the size behavior of a single generic polymer model in implicit - solvent computer simulations .",
    "a two - component flory - de gennes model could describe all trends observed in the simulations , in particular both the monotonic and non - monotonic behavior of @xmath37 , that we have demonstrated to explicitly reflect the degree of non - additivity of the monomeric cross interactions .",
    "the discussed trends resemble the miscibility behavior in copolymer blends  @xcite and are consistent with experimental lcst behavior of thermosensitive polymers . for linear and",
    "uncharged copolymers experiments have reported both , a monotonic @xcite as well as a non - monotonic @xcite dependency of @xmath78 on the degree of copolymerization @xmath35 .",
    "we demonstrated that the non - monotonicity can be explained by the non - additive contributions from the preferential attraction between nipam and n , n - diethylacrylamide ( deaam ) monomers , where unlike acceptor and donor pairs attract by h - bonding mechanisms .",
    "our effective mean - field treatment is thus complementary to the more microscopic explanation of these effects put forward recently on the basis of cooperative hydration effects .",
    "@xcite    obviously , there are many limitations of our work that could be addressed in future . in the presented work , for instance",
    ", a temperature - independent lennard - jones potential has been used .",
    "however , more realistic effective potentials should include solvent and maybe even cosolvent effects . to directly connect to lcst experiments , it would be necessary to introduce explicitly temperature - dependent pair potentials  @xcite and virial coefficients .",
    "@xcite other effects not considered in our model are for example the sequential arrangement of the co - monomers , i.e. , the composition effect  @xcite or electrostatic charging effects .",
    "@xcite for the latter , a simple donnan - like model was devised by us recently where experimental lcst changes by charge fractionation of the polymer and the addition of salt could be described in a satisfactory fashion .",
