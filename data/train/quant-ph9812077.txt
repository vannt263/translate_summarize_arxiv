    "the orbit of a classical particle in a central field , due to the angular momentum conservation , must lie in a plane perpendicular to the angular momentum .",
    "however , the orbit is , in general , not closed . in classical mechanics there is a famous bertrand s theorem@xcite , which says that _ the only central forces that result in closed orbits for all bound particles are the inverse square law and hooke s law_. for the two central potentials , apart from the energy and angular momentum , there exists an additional conserved quantity , which implies a higher dynamical symmetry than the geometrical symmetry ( space isotropy ) .    over fifty years ago , schrdinger introduced the factorization method@xcite to treat the eigenvalue problem of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator and the quantized energy eigenvalues of a harmonic oscillator are connected by energy raising and lowering operators .",
    "the factorization method was generalized in the supersymmetry quantum mechanics ( ssqm)@xcite with the help of the concept of supersymmetry and shape invariance .",
    "ssqm mainly focuses on the factorization of one - dimensional schrdinger equation ( including the radial schrdinger equation of a particle in a central field)@xcite and the relation of eigenstates between two quantum systems ( supersymmetric partner ) .",
    "it was shown@xcite that only for the coulomb potential and isotropic harmonic oscillator the radial schrdinger equation can be factorized and _ both the angular momentum and energy raising and lowering operators can be constructed_. this reminds us that there may exist a certain connection between the factorization of radial schrdinger equation and the closeness of classical orbits .",
    "careful examination shows that in the derivation of bertrand s theorem and in @xcite , a power law central potential ( @xmath3 ) was assumed .",
    "for such a power law central potential , the bertrand s theorem does hold .",
    "however , more careful analysis shows that if the restriction of power law form central potential is relaxed , the bertrand s theorem need reexamination . in sect .",
    "ii , it is shown that for the combined type of central potential @xmath4 ( @xmath1 ) , when @xmath2 is the coulomb potential or isotropic harmonic potential , there still exist closed orbits for suitable angular momenta .",
    "the factorization of the corresponding radial schrdinger equation and the connection between the closeness of classical orbits and the existence of raising and lowering operators are investigated in sect .",
    "a brief summary is given in sect .",
    "it will be shown that if the restriction of a pure power law central potential is relaxed , the bertrand s theorem may be extended . in particular ,",
    "when an additional central potential @xmath5 is added to @xmath1 , @xmath6 we will show that when and only when @xmath2 is the coulomb potential or isotropic harmonic potential , there still exist closed orbits for some suitable angular momenta .",
    "the equations of motion of a particle in the central potential ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is expressed as ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the angular momentum and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "it was shown@xcite that for a circular orbit at radius @xmath12 to be possible , the force must be attractive and @xmath13    to guarantee the stability of a circular orbit @xmath14 , it is required@xcite that the second derivative of the effective potential @xmath15 must be positive , i.e.    @xmath16    it is noted that the inclusion of the additional force @xmath17 does not alter the stability condition ( [ eq1.4 ] ) , so we have    @xmath18    thus @xmath19 or @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 . since we are interested in the bounded motion , the case @xmath19 for @xmath21 is excluded .",
    "thus , we obtain the stability condition for circular orbits : @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 .    to seek the condition for closeness of an orbit , let us consider the orbit equation@xcite for potential ( [ eq1.1 ] ) @xmath26 introducing @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we get @xmath30 using ( [ eq1.3 ] )",
    ", it can be shown that at @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , using ( [ eq1.5 ] ) and @xmath25 , one get @xmath33 , then @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the stability condition for circular orbits also may be expressed as : @xmath35 for @xmath21 , and @xmath36 for @xmath23 .    using the taylor expansion of @xmath37 at @xmath38 , a deviation of an orbit from a circle @xmath38 , @xmath39 ,",
    "is governed by @xmath40    for a small deviation of an orbit from circularity , to the first order of @xmath41 , ( [ eq1.77 ] ) is reduced to @xmath42 the solution to ( [ eq1.78 ] ) can be expressed as :    @xmath43    it can be seen that for @xmath44 ( a rational number , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are integers ) , when @xmath47 , @xmath48 , i.e. , the orbit remains closed . thus , we get the condition for closeness of orbits against a small deviation from circularity : @xmath49 _ must be a rational number_.    to seek the condition for a closed orbit when the deviation from circularity is considerable , @xmath41 can be expressed as the fourier expansion , i.e. , in addition to the fundamental term in ( [ eq1.8 ] ) , more terms in the fourier expansion should be included in @xmath41 . substituting @xmath41 in ( [ eq1.77 ] ) and using the arguments similar to @xcite , one get @xmath50=0 , 1 and 4 for closed orbits .",
    "thus , we obtain the conclusion : when ( and only when ) @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) for @xmath23 , and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) for @xmath21 , the orbit is closed .",
    "then , @xmath55 _ must be a rational number_. therefore , for the potential ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , when ( and only when ) @xmath2 is the coulomb potential or isotropic harmonic oscillator , closed orbits still exist for suitable angular momentum @xmath56 , where @xmath55 is a rational number .",
    "@xmath57 for the valence electron in an alkalis atom @xmath58 may be approximately expressed as ( @xmath59)@xcite @xmath60 in this case , the orbit equation ( [ eq1.6 ] ) is reduced to @xmath61 where @xmath62 . integrating ( [ eq1.10 ] ) , we get    @xmath63 ,   \\label{eq1.12}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 to make the solution ( [ eq1.12 ] ) having sense . for @xmath65 ,",
    "the orbits are circular . because @xmath66 for @xmath67 , no elliptic orbits exist . however , when @xmath55 is a rational number , closed orbits ( other than ellipses ) still exist .",

    "it has been shown@xcite that if the power law central potential @xmath2 is assumed , only for the coulomb potential or isotropic harmonic oscillator the radial schrdinger equation can be factorized to derive the raising and lowering operators of @xmath83 ( @xmath84 )",
    ". however , for @xmath84 , the shift in @xmath76 is by no means @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , though the radial schrdinger equation can be factorized for the central potential ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , no angular momentum raising and lowering operators ( @xmath86 ) can be constructed , which is intimately connected with the breaking of the dynamical symmetry of coulomb potential and isotropic harmonic oscillator due to the added term @xmath5 in ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .    for the coulomb potential and isotropic harmonic oscillator , whose exact eigenvalues",
    "are well known , the energy raising and lowering operators have be derived by using different approaches in @xcite . for a particle in a more general central potential ,",
    "the exact energy eigenvalues are usually unknown .",
    "to derive the energy raising and lowering operators , we may use the wkb approximation . according to the wkb approximation , the eigenvalues of bounded states of ( [ eq2.4 ] ) take the form@xcite ( note : here the usual angular momentum @xmath76 has been replaced by @xmath83 ) :    @xmath87    where @xmath88^{\\frac{2\\nu}{\\nu+2}}>0 $ ] , @xmath89 for @xmath21 , and @xmath90 @xmath91^{\\frac{2\\nu}{\\nu+2}}$ ] @xmath92 , @xmath93 for @xmath23 .",

    "the orbit is always closed for any negative energy ( @xmath114 ) and positive angular momentum @xmath9 , i.e. , an ellipse , of which the length of semi - major axis is @xmath115 and the eccentricity @xmath116 .",

    "therefore , it is not surprising that for the coulomb potential the radial schrdinger equation can be factorized and there exist four kinds of raising and lowering operators connecting various eigenstates of energy and angular momentum@xcite .",

    "ii that for suitable angular momenta @xmath121 ( @xmath55 is a rational number ) , the orbits are still closed ( but not ellipses ) .",
