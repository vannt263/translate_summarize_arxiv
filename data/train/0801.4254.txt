    "the use of effective models to understand the phases of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is nowadays a popular tool . among them , the nambu - jona lasinio model ( njl ) is widely used since it allows for a simple discussion of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the main defect of the njl model is that it completely ignores glue dynamics : gluons are not introduced in the lagrangian , and the qcd quark - quark interaction mediated by gluons is replaced by an effective four fermion interaction .",
    "an improvement of the njl model is provided by the introduction of a background temporal static gluon field , coupled to quarks via the qcd covariant derivative .",
    "the gluon field is related to the expectation value of polyakov loop @xmath2  @xcite , and the new model is called polyakov - njl ( pnjl in the following )  @xcite it is well known that the polyakov loop serves as an order parameter for confinement @xmath3 deconfinement transition in the pure glue theory  @xcite . in more detail , the confined phase is characterized by @xmath4 and a @xmath5 symmetry ; on the other hand in the deconfined phase @xmath6 and the symmetry @xmath5 is broken . in presence of dynamical quarks ,",
    "@xmath5 symmetry is explicitly broken and @xmath2 can not be used as an order parameter .",
    "nevertheless it is commonly used as an indicator of the deconfinement transition .    in the pnjl model an effective potential for @xmath2 is added by hand to the quark lagrangian , and @xmath2 is coupled to the quarks via the qcd covariant derivative .",
    "the value of @xmath7 in the ground state , as well as other quantities of interest like the constituent quark masses , are obtained by minimization of the thermodynamic potential , or equivalently by solving coupled gap equations as in the njl case . despite the apparent complication due to the increase of the degrees of freedom , the pnjl model offers a better description of qcd",
    "then njl does since it allows to derive , in the framework of field theory , several results obtained in lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the phase diagram of the pnjl model as well as of its bulk properties is of a certain interest . in this paper",
    "we study the phase diagram and the pion modes in the electrically neutral two flavor pnjl model .",
    "the motivation of our study is straightforward : we are interested to investigate the equilibrium ground state of the model , and in the ground state a net electric charge can not be present , whichever the value of the temperature and of the quark chemical potential is .",
    "we consider the possibility of chiral as well as pion condensation in the ground state , at zero and non zero quark chemical potential .",
    "a related study without electrical neutrality and at zero chemical potential has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar study in the framework of the electrically neutral njl model in the chiral limit .",
    "one of the results of our work is that when electrical neutrality is required , pion do not condense in the ground state of the model : the isospin chemical potential @xmath0 , with @xmath8 the electron chemical potential , is always smaller than the value required for pion condensation to occur .",
    "moreover we investigate on the pions and @xmath1 mass spectra .",
    "we find that the qualitative behavior of the masses resembles that obtained in the njl model .",
    "we close this paper by studying the possibility that a bound state with the quantum numbers of the pions can be formed above the chiral phase transition .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : for ] we briefly describe the pnjl model ; in section  [ sec : pd ] we show the phase diagram of the model , and some results for quantities of interest ( in medium quark mass , pion condensate , mean value of the polyakov loop , electron chemical potential ) . in section",

    "<S> we study the phase diagram and the pion modes in the electrically neutral two flavor pnjl model . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main result of this paper is that in the model with massive quarks , when electrical neutrality is required , pions do not condense in the ground state of the model : the isospin chemical potential @xmath0 is always smaller than the value required for pion condensation to occur . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we investigate on the pions and @xmath1 mass spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the qualitative behavior of the masses resembles that obtained in the njl model . </S>",
    "<S> we close this paper by studying the intriguing possibility that bound states with the quantum numbers of the pions can be formed above the chiral phase transition . </S>"
