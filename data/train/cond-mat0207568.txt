    "the quasi - particles in the mixed state of @xmath0-wave superconductors has attracted much attention in connection with the peculiar low - energy excitations under a magnetic field in high-@xmath2 cuprates  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the extended quasi - particle states in extremely type - ii @xmath0-wave superconductors on the basis of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation , focusing on the topological nature of the quasi - particles .",
    "it is well - known that the order parameter has a non - trivial phase in the presence of vortices , that is , the phase @xmath3 is a multi - valued function satisfying the relation , @xmath4 , in the mixed state where vortices ( @xmath5 ) are located at @xmath6 .",
    "then , the bdg equation contains a multi - valued function , which makes the equation intractable .",
    "anderson noticed that the phase @xmath3 in the bdg equation can be eliminated in terms of a singular phase transformation , by which the bdg equation is transformed into the one containing @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this is an important observation , because @xmath7 is a single - valued function , that is , the transformed bdg equation includes only single - valued functions .",
    "however , it turns out , as shown in this paper , that the topological character of the system is not fully incorporated into the wave functions by this transformation .",
    "one should note that a superconductor containing vortices may be considered as a multi - connected system .",
    "then , the quasi - particles moving around vortices show the ab effect  @xcite . from this fact one understands that the wave functions of the quasi - particles should be _ path - dependent single - valued functions _ in the presence of vortices .    in this paper",
    "we clarify the topological character of the non - trivial phases of the wave functions satisfying the bdg equation and show that the quasi - particle eigen - states have a hidden \" quantum number which is related to the homotopy class of the classical orbits of the quasi - particles .",
    "we also develop a theoretical scheme for solving approximately the bdg equation in the field region @xmath8 , correcting the incomplete treatments for the topological singularity of @xmath3 in previous works .",
    "numerical solutions for the extended quasi - particle states in @xmath0-wave superconductors are briefly presented .",

    "we investigate the extended quasi - particle states outside the vortex cores in the field region @xmath8 , so that we may approximate the gap function as @xmath17 neglecting the spatial dependence of the gap amplitude . in the case",
    "where @xmath18 vortices ( @xmath19-axis ) are located at @xmath20 in the @xmath21 plane , the phase @xmath22 in eq.(3 ) is dependent on the vortex positions , i.e. , @xmath23 , and is a multi - valued function satisfying the relation , @xmath24 to express the bdg equation in terms of only single - valued functions , removing the multi - valued function @xmath3 , anderson proposed a transformation for the wave functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eq.(1 ) as follows  @xcite , @xmath27 this transformation has been utilized by several authors for studying the low energy excitations in the mixed state of @xmath0-wave superconductors  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "franz and teanovi pointed out that the phase can be eliminated also by the transformation , @xmath28 , if @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the phase factor @xmath30 in eq.(1 ) can really be excluded from the bdg equation by these transformations , but we claim that these manipulations should not be considered as the _",
    "transformations_. let us suppose that the wave functions in the @xmath18-vortex state , @xmath31 , are expressed as @xmath32 when the non - trivial phases in the wave functions are explicitly extracted . in eq.(7 ) @xmath33 is assumed to be a _ half and integer _ , namely , @xmath34 .",
    "note that the phases in eq.(7 ) satisfy the franz - teanovi condition mentioned above ( @xmath29 ) and eq.(7 ) is also reduced to the anderson s transformation ( 6 ) for @xmath35 if eq.(7 ) is considered as the transformation , @xmath36 .",
    "hence , it is clear that the phase factor @xmath37 is eliminated in the equation for @xmath38 .",
    "the new equation for @xmath39 and @xmath40 contains explicitly a number @xmath33 , so that the energy eigenvalues explicitly depend on @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , it turns out from the calculations shown later that the energy eigen - states can be classified in terms of @xmath33 . from these results",
    "one can interpret @xmath33 as a _ quantum number specifying the quasi - particle eigen - states _ in the @xmath18-vortex state .",

    "suppose that @xmath46 does not include any other vortices inside it ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "then , the operation of @xmath49 on the phase @xmath3 induces the shift , @xmath50 suppose that the wave functions , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , have non - trivial phases , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . since @xmath51 and @xmath52 should be _ single - valued functions _ , we have in general @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 being integers .",
    "then , eq.(5 ) indicates the relations , @xmath60 under the conditions , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , from the gap equation , @xmath63 ( see appendix a ) , one may assume the equality , @xmath64 then , from the operation of @xmath49 on both sides of eq.(11 ) it follows , @xmath65 comparing this relation with eq.(8 ) , one finds @xmath66 with @xmath33 being a half and integer .",
    "since these relations are simultaneously satisfied when @xmath67 we obtain eq.(7 ) .",
    "we can also show that the gap equation expressed in terms of the wave functions ( 7 ) yields @xmath3 for the phase of the order parameter ( see appendix a ) .",
    "note that eq.(7 ) holds for @xmath68 , i.e. , the single vortex state . as is well - known , the wave functions in the 2d single vortex state are expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the polar coordinates  @xcite , which indicates that the phase @xmath3 is expressed in terms of the geometrical angle @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72 , in this state and then @xmath33 ( @xmath73 accords with the quantum number for the 2d angular momentum , though in general @xmath33 is a topological one .",
    "thus , our conjecture ( 7 ) is consistent with the well - known result in the single vortex state .",
    "note that @xmath33 is still a rigorous quantum number in the system with a curved vortex , in which the angular momentum is not conserved .",
    "let us now study the bdg equation ( 1 ) , using eq.(7 ) . in the present @xmath0-wave case",
    "we must be careful about the order of differentiations in eq.(3 ) , because @xmath74 in the vortex state  @xcite . to avoid the ambiguity in the order of differentiations we symmetrize the differential operations in eq.(3 ) as @xmath75 . then",

    "can be split into the average value , @xmath86 , and the deviation from it , @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath88 . since",
    "the lattice constant @xmath0 is much shorter than the london penetration depth @xmath89 in this field region , the vortex currents flowing around vortices are heavily overlapped and , as a result , canceled out , which indicates the relation , @xmath90 is neglected in the 0th order approximation , @xmath91 . in this paper",
    "we confine ourselves to the lowest order approximation .",
    "then , in this approximation we have the relation from the maxwell equation as follows , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the local superfluid density .",
    "since @xmath94 const.@xmath95 outside the vortex cores , one can assume @xmath96 in the present approximation .",
    "then , noting eq.(18 ) , we find the approximate relation , @xmath97 where the vector potential @xmath98 is related to the average flux density as @xmath99 .",

    "eq.(29 ) also indicates that the quasi - particle eigen - states in the mixed state of 2d @xmath0-wave superconductors can be classified in terms of two quantum numbers , namely @xmath33 , which has the topological origin , and @xmath43 , which is reduced to the landau - level index in the normal state ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the quantum number @xmath33 is a rigorous quantum number in the mixed state of type ii superconductors , which is independent of approximations used in this paper . from the above results we finally obtain the coupled equations for the coefficients , @xmath133 , as @xmath134\\alpha_k^{n\\mu } % -\\frac{1}{8}\\tilde\\delta_0\\alpha_{k+1}^{n\\mu } % % \\begin{equation } -\\frac{1}{4}\\mu\\tilde\\delta_0\\sqrt{(k+1)(k+3 ) }",

    "these states appears in the case of @xmath144 in our calculations .",
    "the existence of the zero - energy state has been predicted in the approximate calculations in ref.[7 ] .",
    "these zero - energy states are formed mainly by the quasi - particles lying in the nodal directions in the @xmath129-space .",
    "it is also seen that the two or four consecutive levels have close eigen - values in the low energy region .",
    "this result comes from that the state with index @xmath129 does not couple with that with @xmath145 of @xmath146 or @xmath147 , as seen in eqs.(31 ) and ( 32 ) . in fig.3",
    "we plot the energy eigen - values in the @xmath148 band for three values of @xmath1 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath144 holds in these cases , since @xmath149mev@xmath150 for @xmath151 t in the present choice of the parameter values .",
    "then , the energy levels are essentially the same in this field region , except that the dispersion becomes steeper as @xmath1 increases .    to investigate the crossover behavior due to the variation of the flux density @xmath1 from @xmath144 to @xmath152 we calculate the lowest excitation energy as a function of @xmath1 , choosing a small value for @xmath153 .",
    "fig.4 shows the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath154 with @xmath155 in the case of @xmath156 mev . in this choice of the parameter values we find @xmath157 for @xmath158 t .",
    "as seen in this figure , the lowest energy eigen - state has zero - energy in the weak field region of @xmath144 , but it abruptly changes to a gapped state above some value of @xmath1 , which indicates that the quasi - particle eigen - states acquire a full energy - gap in the strong field region , though the symmetry of the gap function is the same as in the meissner state .",
    "this result may be intuitively understood in the following way .",
    "the quasi - particles lying in the nodal directions with @xmath159 can not turn by the effect of a weak lorentz force when the pair - potential barrier is high . then , in the weak filed region the quasi - particle states in the nodal directions are expected to be gapless .",
    "however , in the strong field region where the lorentz force is strong enough , i.e. , @xmath160 .",
    "the quasi - particles in the nodal directions can run through the pair - potential barrier . in order to excite the quasi - particles going through the barrier of the pair - potential we need a finite excitation energy , which leads to a finite energy gap .",
    "it has been proved in the gl limit , in which the landau - level splitting is completely neglected , that the @xmath9-component is induced in the mixed state of @xmath161-wave superconductors  @xcite , which also creates fully - gapped quasi - particle states .",
    "however , the origin of the energy gap in the gl limit is completely different from that in the present theory .",
    "this result seems consistent with the experimental observation for the thermal conductivity in the mixed state  @xcite . in the strong field region of @xmath162 , namely @xmath163 t in the present case , the lowest excitation energy shows oscillatory behavior in the @xmath1-dependence , as seen in fig.4 .",
    "these oscillations reflect the field dependence of the diagonal components of eq.(29 ) , that is , they are the quantum oscillations which lead to the de haas - van alphen effect . thus , our theory for the extended quasi - particles in the mixed state of @xmath0-wave superconductors can describes the crossover behavior from the gapless phase in the weak field region to the gapped phase showing the quantum oscillations in the strong field region .",
    "in summary we investigated the extended quasi - particle states of @xmath0-wave superconductors in the field region , @xmath8 , on the basis of the bdg equation .",
    "we found new topological quantum numbers which classify the quasi - particle eigen - states in the mixed state of type - ii superconductors .",
    "the phase of a qausi - particle should be path - dependent in the presence of vortices , which is essentially the same as in a multi - connected system showing the aharnnov - bohm effect .",
    "hence , one understands that the quantum numbers carrying information about the homotopy class of the orbit of the quasi - particle appear in the mixed state of type ii superconductors .",
    "we also presented numerical solutions of the bdg equation in the field region , @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown that the quasi - particle states show the crossover behavior from gappless to gapped states as the flux density increases . in the strong field region of @xmath164",
    "the quantum oscillations appear in the excitation energy .",
    "the author would like to thank dr .",
    "m. machida for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we derive the gap equation in the present @xmath9-superconductors .",
    "the gap function in unconventional superconductors has generally the form , @xmath165 @xmath166       -v_i^\\ast({\\bf r})u_i({\\bf r}^\\prime)f_{\\rm f}(e_i)\\bigr\\ } ,   % ( a.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath167 denotes the interaction between superconducting electrons .",
