    "since several decades polymer brushes find abiding interest for various applications , and have been studied very intensively by experiment , analytical theory , and computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the structure of these soft polymeric layers and their response to various external perturbations depends in a delicate way on various control parameters such as molecular weight , grafting density , quality of the solvent , and character of the interactions between monomeric units and the substrate to which the macromolecules are grafted .",
    "however , inspired by the early works @xcite , mostly brushes formed from completely flexible chains were considered , where the elastic response is entirely entropic , due to the configurational degrees of freedom of the tethered chain molecules . in such brushes",
    ", chains may be nevertheless strongly stretched in the direction perpendicular to the substrate , to avoid unfavorable monomer - monomer overlap in the case of sufficiently dense grafting .",
    "effects of intrinsic chain stiffness , as are expected for semi - flexible polymers @xcite , did find rather little attention @xcite , apart from the case where one considers grafted semi - flexible chains in nematic solvents @xcite and their liquid crystalline order @xcite .",
    "we also draw attention to some related problems where rod - like molecules densely packed and anchoring at substrates play a role , such as in langmuir monolayers of surfactants and related systems @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the interactions between dna - grafted colloids @xcite , or poly(acrylic acid ) brushes with variable rigidity @xcite , have been comprehensively investigated by f.  kremer and collaborators . in recent years , semi - flexible polymers find increasing interest particularly in the context of biophysical systems , such as cytoskeleton actin bundles @xcite biofilaments @xcite , and also biobased polymer brushes were recently created @xcite .",
    "thus , a more comprehensive simulation study of brushes formed from semi - flexible polymers would be desirable to theoretically clarify the effect of chain stiffness on structure and dynamics of such systems , including also their response to external perturbations , such as shear and compressive forces .    as is well known , one important possible application of polymer brushes formed from flexible polymers is their use as a lubricant @xcite , although the theoretical aspects of this response to shear and compression are still under discussion @xcite . in our preliminary publication @xcite , indeed , an anomalous response of brushes formed from rather stiff chains was found , caused by an onset of orientational order parallel to the substrate .    in the present paper",
    "we shall give a more complete account of this problem , focusing mainly on the structure and static behavior of such stiff brushes subject to compression .",
    "in the next section [ sec_model ] , the model that is studied will be introduced and the simulation method will be described .",
    "section [ sec_structure ] examines the parallel and perpendicular chain linear dimensions in rigid brushes as a function of bending rigidity and grafting density over a wide range , as well as the profiles of monomer density in the direction perpendicular to the grafting substrate , and the end monomer distribution .",
    "then in section [ sec_compress ] we elaborate the topic that was already briefly addressed in our preliminary study , compression of such brushes by a piston , presenting new results , including also the variation with grafting density and chain length .",
    "the hysteresis associated with the transition towards orientational order will also be investigated .",
    "section [ sec_theory ] is devoted to an attempt for theoretical consideration within the mean - field approximation of the brush response to deformation . a brief account on the recovery dynamics of compressed stiff brushes",
    "is then given in section [ sec_dynamics ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "we start from the standard model for polymer brushes formed from completely flexible polymers @xcite and complement it by adding a bond angle potential .",

    "in addition , for any pairs of monomers ( both bonded and non - bonded ones ) a truncated and shifted lennard - jones potential acts , the so - called weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential @xcite @xmath7 , \\ ; r < r_c = 2^{1/6 } \\sigma , \\ ] ] while @xmath8 .",

    "note that the effective persistence length of an isolated chain would be @xmath23 ; of course .",
    "due to packing effects in dense systems , local nematic order may arise as a result of interchain interactions that lead to nematic short or long range order , and then the persistence length can be appreciably larger ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for small @xmath24 , the persistence length is , in general , not a well defined quantity @xcite .",

    "<S> using a coarse - grained bead - spring model for semi - flexible macromolecules forming a polymer brush , structure and dynamics of the polymers is investigated , varying chain stiffness and grafting density . the anchoring condition for the grafted chains </S>",
    "<S> is chosen such that their first bonds are oriented along the normal to the substrate plane .    </S>",
    "<S> compression of such a semi - flexible brush by a planar piston is observed to be a two - stage process : for small compressions the chains contract by `` buckling '' deformation whereas for larger compression the chains exhibit a collective ( almost uniform ) bending deformation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the stiff polymer brush undergoes a @xmath0-nd order phase transition of collective bond reorientation . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure , required to keep the stiff brush at a given degree of compression , is thereby significantly _ smaller _ than for an otherwise identical brush made of entirely flexible polymer chains ! while both the brush height and the chain linear dimension in the @xmath1-direction perpendicular to the substrate increase monotonically with increasing chain stiffness , lateral @xmath2 chain linear dimensions exhibit a maximum at intermediate chain stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the grafting density leads to a strong decrease of these lateral dimensions , compatible with an exponential decay . </S>",
    "<S> also the recovery kinetics after removal of the compressing piston is studied , and found to follow a power - law / exponential decay with time .    a simple mean - field theoretical consideration , accounting for the buckling / bending behavior of semi - flexible polymer brushes under compression , is suggested . </S>"
