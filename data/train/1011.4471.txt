    "interferometry is a hallmark of wave physics .",
    "while optical interferometers have been known since past centuries , more recently remarkable efforts have been made to realize _ electronic _ interferometers , which exploit the wavelike nature of electrons , a signature of quantum world . due to the decoherence effects",
    "that electrons experience in ordinary macroscopic metals , such type of wavelike phenomenon can be observed only in mesoscopic systems .",
    "fabry - prot interference pattern caused by electron waves reflected at the contacts between a carbon nanostructure and two metallic electrodes have been observed in various experiments on nanotubes@xcite and graphene @xcite .",
    "similarly , clear evidence of aharonov - bohm effect has been demonstrated in semiconductor heterostructures and graphene rings threaded by a magnetic flux@xcite , and various electron interferometers have been realized in quantum hall effect ( qhe ) systems .",
    "@xcite    electron interferometry is not just a conceptually important effect , it has significant practical consequences , for it can be exploited to realize quantum transistors with high current - carrying capability@xcite .",
    "indeed currents can be switched ` on ' and ` off ' by varying the electron interference conditions from constructive to destructive through a gate voltage or a magnetic field .",
    "+ at present , most electronic interferometers are based on the electron charge .",
    "however , electron is also characterized by its spin , and spintronics  the field investigating transport and manipulation of information with such degree of freedom  is experiencing an extremely rapid growth .",
    "indeed spin is much more robust to environment decoherence effects with respect to electron charge@xcite , and spin coherence lengths may reach and exceed @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite for these reasons , interferometry involving spin has been proposed to realize transistors and filters exploiting spin - orbit induced precession in semiconductors@xcite , ferromagnetic materials@xcite and magnetic fields@xcite . in spite of these advances , interferometric control of spin currents",
    "remains a difficult task requiring _ ad hoc _ optical techniques@xcite , and has not reached the state of the art level .",
    "thus , as far as interferometry is concerned , spintronics is not as competitive as ordinary charge - based electronics yet .",
    "a major boost to spintronics is expected to come from the recent discovery of topological insulators . a topological insulator ( ti )",
    "is a bulk gapped material exhibiting conducting gapless channels at the boundaries.@xcite in these edge states the generation of spin currents is greatly facilitated from the close connection between motion direction and spin orientation ( helicity ) . in two - dimensional realizations of a ti , for instance ,",
    "only spin-@xmath1 electrons propagate rightwards and only spin-@xmath2 electrons leftwards , along a given boundary .",
    "remarkably , ti edge states behave as perfectly conducting one - dimensional ballistic channels , since impurity backscattering is prevented from time reversal symmetry .",
    "these peculiar properties , theoretically predicted@xcite and experimentally observed in hgte / cdte quantum wells@xcite and in various other materials@xcite , make tis ideal candidates for spintronics.@xcite    for these reasons the investigation of electron interference effects in these systems appears to be a particularly timely issue .",
    "quite recently , for instance , evidence of aharonov - bohm interference pattern in magnetoresistance of tis has been experimentally observed@xcite and theoretically discussed@xcite .",
    "notably , comparative analysis have pointed out that , with respect to the cases of edge states in qhe bars@xcite and su(2 ) symmetric systems@xcite , interferometry of ti edge states exhibits intrinsically different behavior , and represents a challenging open problem with its own peculiarities .",
    "so far , most studies concerning ti interferometry have involved magnetic flux or ferromagnets.@xcite however , ti edge states appear even in the absence of magnetic field , since the mechanism underlying their properties is the spin - orbit coupling and the related inversion of the electronic band order .",
    "indeed this represents one of the crucial advantages of tis with respect to qhe edge states in view of device miniaturization , due to the difficulty in realizing scalable circuits operating under high magnetic fields or space varying magnetizations with nanoscale resolution .",
    "it is thus desirable to explore ti interferometry also in absence of magnetic fields or ferromagnets .    in this article",
    "we address interferometry based on purely electrical effects , i.e. in the presence of time reversal symmetry .",
    "we shall focus on a two - dimensional realization of a ti , and consider the interferometer sketched in fig.[setup - fig ] , where kramers pairs of ti edge states flow at the top and bottom boundaries of a quantum well .",
    "the electrochemical potential of each injected edge state is controlled by a metallic electrode , characterized by a voltage bias @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "inter - boundary scattering between edge states can occur at two quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) , giving rise to the possibility of loop trajectories , which determine the currents through electron wave interference . here",
    "the interference conditions are set by two ( top and bottom ) gate voltages @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which modify the electron phase in the loop processes by shifting the electron momenta in the regions between the two qpcs .",
    "the setup of fig.[setup - fig ] can thus lead to a full electrically controllable system , where charge and spin conductances of each electrode can be tuned by the gates .",
    "we shall determine and discuss the behavior of the conductances as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for various configurations of the biases  @xmath3 .",
    "in particular we shall show that , under appropriate conditions , inter - boundary coupling can even lead to negative conductance values .",
    "furthermore , the setup also allows to selectively generate and tune pure charge or pure spin currents .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the model for the setup , in section  [ sec3 ] we discuss the interference phenomena of the system and point out the relations with other electron interferometers .",
    "then , in section  [ sec4 ] we show the results concerning charge and spin currents , mainly focussing on two specific configurations of the four terminal setup . finally , we discuss the results in section  [ sec5 ] and draw our conclusions in section  [ sec6 ] .",

    "the dashed box denotes the scattering region , where inter - boundary tunneling occurs at two qpcs , located around positions @xmath7 and @xmath8 and separated by a distance @xmath9 .",
    "two gate voltages @xmath5 and @xmath6 shift the edge state momenta in the top and bottom regions between the qpcs , modifying the electron phase in the loop processes induced by tunneling .",
    "no magnetic flux is present . ]",
    "the edge states at the top and bottom boundaries of the device are characterized , at low energies , by a linear spectrum described by the following hamiltonian@xcite @xmath10 \\ ,             \\label{h0w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the right and left mover electron field operators , and @xmath14 the spin component .",
    "here we adopt the notation that spin-@xmath1 right ( left ) movers and spin-@xmath2 left ( right ) movers flow along the top ( bottom ) boundary , as depicted in fig.[setup - fig ] . without loss of generality",
    "we shall assume that the equilibrium fermi level @xmath15 of the device in the absence of any bias is located at the dirac point of the spectrum .",
    "the symbol @xmath16 in eq.([h0w ] ) denotes the normal ordering with respect to the equilibrium state where all levels below @xmath15 are occupied .",
    "variations from this energy level can be induced by the gate voltages , as discussed below .",
    "the constrictions of the qpcs induce inter - boundary scattering .",
    "it can be shown with quite general arguments@xcite that time - reversal symmetry only allows two types of tunneling terms , namely a spin - preserving tunneling @xmath17 and a spin - flipping tunneling @xmath18 in fact , the pinching of the two edges states at the qpcs causes a local modification of the spin - orbit coupling with respect to the bulk case , so that both terms are expected to contribute.@xcite in eqs.([htun - sp ] ) and ( [ htun - sf ] ) @xmath19 denote space - dependent tunneling amplitude profiles .",
    "the two qpcs will thus be described through a profile peaked around two centers @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see fig.[setup - fig ] ) , and rapidly decaying beyond a longitudinal lengthscale @xmath20 .",
    "we shall assume that the constriction are short with respect to the fermi wavelength  @xmath21 , and that the distance @xmath9 between the two qpcs is large compared to @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath22 . under these conditions , it is sufficient to assume that tunneling is point - like . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we shall also consider that the two qpcs are characterized by equal tunneling amplitudes , so that the profiles can be taken as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real dimensionless spin - preserving and spin - flipping tunneling amplitudes , respectively .",
    "+ finally , the coupling to the two gate voltages @xmath5 and  @xmath6 can be described by the term @xmath26 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes the electron density , with @xmath28 and @xmath14 .",
    "as anticipated above , @xmath5 and @xmath6 shift the electronic spectrum ( [ h0w ] ) , and their difference breaks the degeneracy between top and bottom boundaries .",
    "+ the equations of motion for the four fields @xmath29 are easily obtained from the total hamiltonian of the device @xmath30 where the four terms are given in eqs.([h0w ] ) , ( [ htun - sp ] ) , ( [ htun - sf ] ) and  ( [ hgate ] ) , respectively . for @xmath31 , for instance , one obtains @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the heaviside function .",
    "similar equations are obtained for the other fields .",
    "the four equations , coupled by the inter - boundary tunneling terms , can be solved by superposing solutions corresponding to fixed energy values . at a given energy  @xmath34 , measured with respect to the equilibrium fermi level @xmath15",
    ", the solution can be obtained by the ansatz @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 denotes the electron operator inside the scattering region .",
    "the incoming and outgoing electrons , respectively described by the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 in ( [ ansatz ] ) , are connected via the entries @xmath42 of the scattering matrix @xmath43  @xcite @xmath44 in the columns of eq.([s - fp ] ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 operators appear according to the clockwise order of the four leads in the setup fig.[setup - fig ] .",
    "a lengthy but straightforward calculation allows to determine the scattering matrix entries @xmath42 as a function of the tunneling amplitudes @xmath45 and the gate voltages @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "helicity and time - reversal symmetry lead to vanishing diagonal entries , @xmath46 while the other entries can be expressed in a compact form by utilizing the transmission coefficients of each single qpc in terms of the tunneling amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 here @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) denotes the transmission coefficient from lead @xmath52 to lead @xmath53 of the left ( right ) qpc alone .",
    "time reversal symmetry ensures @xmath54 furthermore , we have assumed that the qpcs have identical parameters @xmath55 then , the @xmath56-matrix entries read @xmath57 where @xmath58 similar expressions are found for the other entries , together with the following relations latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the charge density operator , and @xmath86 is the spin current operator@xcite , with the electron densities @xmath87 given by  eq.([rho - def ] ) . equation ( [ hgate - bis ] ) shows that the sum of the gate voltages , i.e. the fp phase  ( [ fp - phase ] ) , couples to the charge density , while their difference , i.e. the ab phase  ( [ ab - phase ] ) , couples to the spin current . the expression ( [ hgate - bis ] ) points out a difference with respect to fabry - prot electron interferometers realized with carbon nanotubes or quantum wires . in these systems spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath2",
    "electrons flow along the same physical channel ; the gate voltage applies in the same way to all @xmath87 ( @xmath28 and @xmath14 ) , so that it effectively couples to the charge density @xmath88 only .",
    "in contrast , in tis the space separation between boundaries allows for the presence of two different gate voltages [ see eq.([hgate ] ) ] , and the helical nature of the edge states leads to the coupling to the spin current @xmath89 as well .",
    "as we shall see , this additional handle offers interesting possibilities to control the spin current . + the fact that only @xmath90 and @xmath91 appear in eq.([hgate - bis ] ) is due to the time - reversal symmetry of the system .",
    "indeed electron charge and spin current operators are the only two combinations of the four densities @xmath87 that are even under time reversal , whereas the electron current @xmath92 and spin density @xmath93 are odd .",
    "this enables us to highlight the differences with respect to the more traditional magnetic aharonov - bohm effect investigated in semiconductors@xcite and graphene@xcite rings , qhe systems@xcite , and also ti edge states@xcite . in these systems",
    "a coupling occurs between the vector potential and the charge current @xmath94 , and the interference is driven by the magnetic flux , breaking time reversal symmetry .",
    "in contrast , the aharonov - bohm phase ( [ ab - phase ] ) related to the process in fig.[interf](b ) originates from a purely _ electrostatic _ effect , preserving time - reversal symmetry : the electron momenta in the two ` arms ' of the ring are different whenever @xmath95 .    on the other hand , the interferometric process in fig.[interf](b ) also differs from the electrostatic aharonov - bohm effect@xcite .",
    "while in such effect the electron spin plays no role , here the helical properties of ti edge states relate the ab phase @xmath96 to spin flipping processes , thus modifying the spin current , as we shall describe below .",
    "a distinction can also be pointed out with respect to the aharonov - casher effect , observed in various mesoscopic semiconductor ring nanostructures@xcite . in that case a spin precession along the ring arms is caused by a uniform rashba spin - orbit coupling , which can be controlled via a gate by varying the asymmetry of the quantum well structure .",
    "this yields a spin - dependent phase difference between the two ring arms@xcite .",
    "in contrast , here spin flip processes occur only locally at the qpcs , and @xmath96 is actually independent of the spin .",
    "+ finally , another important difference with respect to electron interferometers realized with nanotubes or semiconductor rings is concerned with the coupling to the biasing electrodes .",
    "such interferometers consist of two - terminal setups , where spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath2 electrons are injected from the same electrode and flow along the same physical channel . in contrast , ti edge states are geometrically separated and the four terminals in fig.[setup - fig ] allow for an independent control of the four injected electron species . for these reasons",
    "the topology of the interferometer under investigation here is intrinsically much richer than the above interferometers .",
    "as we shall show , this property enables a tunability of the type ( charge or spin ) , the magnitude and , in some cases , also of the sign of the currents .",
    "we shall now present the results concerning the currents in terms of the applied biases and gate voltages .",
    "the definitions of charge and spin current are given by eqs.([ic - def ] ) and ( [ is - def ] ) , respectively .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) and exploiting the scattering matrix ( [ s - fp ] ) , the currents flowing in each terminal are easily evaluated in terms of the fermi distributions @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) of the states injected from the four leads@xcite . due to the presence of four distribution functions ( each including bias voltage and temperature ) and to various parameters of the fabry - prot interferometer ,",
    "the behavior of the current exhibits an extremely rich scenario .",
    "since we are interested in the quantum regime , we shall limit our analysis to the zero temperature case .",
    "furthermore , we shall focus on configurations where non vanishing voltage biases are applied to the electrodes on the left - hand side of the sample ( terminals 1 and 2 ) , and the currents are measured in the terminals on the right - hand side ( 3 and 4 ) , which are assumed to be grounded , i.e. @xmath99 , with @xmath100 denoting the fermi distribution of any lead at equilibrium . under these circumstances ,",
    "the expression for the charge current in the @xmath53-th lead ( @xmath101 ) reduces to @xmath102 and the spin currents fulfill the following relations @xmath103 equation ( [ is - gen ] ) points out that the charge currents measured in terminals 3 and 4 are always accompanied by a spin current , as expected from the peculiar properties of ti edge states .",
    "the difference in the relative sign between charge and spin currents can be easily understood even in the absence of the qpcs .",
    "indeed a positive voltage bias applied to terminal 2 injects spin-@xmath1 electrons into the scattering region , whereas a positive voltage bias applied to terminal 1 injects spin-@xmath2 electrons , leading to parallel charge currents and counter - flowing spin currents [ see eqs.([is - def ] ) and ( [ ic - def ] ) ] .",
    "+ in particular , we are interested in two configurations of applied voltage biases @xmath104 and @xmath105 , namely @xmath106    the labels ` charge ' and ` spin ' associated with these bias configurations originate from the overall degree of freedom injected into the scattering region , depicted in fig.[setup - fig ] as a dashed box . indeed in configuration  ( c ) the amount of spin-@xmath1 and spin-@xmath2 electrons injected from terminals 1 and 2",
    "is the same , so that effectively only the charge degree of freedom is injected , and no net spin .",
    "in contrast , in configuration  ( s ) the lead 1 is negatively biased , determining a depletion of spin-@xmath2 electrons with respect to the equilibrium situation . in this case",
    "only a spin degree of freedom is supplied to the scattering region , with no net amount of injected charge .",
    "similar configurations have been discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] . in intermediate situations , i.e. when @xmath107 , both charge and spin degree of freedom are involved . the injected degree of freedom ( charge and/or spin ) experiences scattering events due to the inter - boundary tunneling terms , which determine the current actually measured in terminals 3 and 4",
    "for each configuration one can define charge and spin conductances in the @xmath53-th lead as the linear response of @xmath94 and @xmath108 to the bias @xmath109 + @xmath110 in the following we shall describe the behavior of @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the two configurations  ( c ) and ( s ) .",
    "let us start by describing the charge bias configuration  ( c ) eq.([conf - c ] ) . in this case , using the expressions ( [ ic - gen])-([is - gen ] ) for the currents , the definition  ( [ gcs ] ) , and the properties  ( [ s - prop ] ) of the scattering matrix , one obtains @xmath113 where @xmath62 denote the transmission coefficients of the setup .",
    "using eqs.([tij - def ] ) and ( [ smatr - entries ] ) , one obtains @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the transmission coefficient of each single qpc defined in eqs.([tij1-def ] ) , and @xmath70 is the fabry - prot phase .",
    "here we have assumed qpc with equal parameters , i.e. @xmath116 . the oscillatory behavior of @xmath117 is shown in fig.[gc - fig - phifp ] for different values of @xmath115 .",
    "recalling the expression ( [ fp - phase ] ) for  @xmath70 , one can see that the oscillations have a period @xmath118 in the sum @xmath71 .",
    "the maxima occur at @xmath119 ( @xmath120 any integer ) , i.e. when the two paths of the fp loop [ fig.[interf](a ) ] interfere destructively , favouring direct transmission from terminal 2 to 3 .",
    "these maxima are indeed resonances , for the tunneling amplitudes of the two qpc are equal ; a slight difference in the parameters would make resonances become maxima very close to 1 .",
    "this type of behavior of @xmath117 for the charge bias configuration  ( c ) is quite similar to the gate - induced fabry - prot oscillations in the linear conductance of a single channel quantum wire@xcite or a carbon nanotube transistor.@xcite at the level of interference processes , the relations between such systems and the electron loops originating from spin - preserving tunneling processes have been pointed out in section  [ sec - fp ] . here",
    "we find that , in configuration  ( c ) , the analogy extends to the conductance behavior as well .",
    "indeed in configuration  ( c ) the electrodes 1 and 2 are characterized by the same fermi distribution , and so are terminal 3 and 4 .",
    "this configuration is thus topologically very similar to a two - terminal setup realized with carbon nanotubes or semiconductor quantum wires , and the dependence of @xmath117 on the fabry - prot phase @xmath70 can thus be straightforwardly understood in terms of such analogy .    on the other hand , eq.([expr - a ] ) has been obtained also taking into account spin - flipping tunneling terms . in view of the discussion in section  [ sec3b ]",
    ", one would thus expect a dependence of @xmath117 on the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath121 as well . indeed such dependence does occur in each of the transmission coefficients",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath82 appearing in the expression  ( [ g - c ] ) for @xmath117 [ see eqs.([tij - def ] ) and ( [ smatr - entries ] ) ] .",
    "however , the result eq.([expr - a ] ) shows that this is not the case for the sum @xmath122 and for the conductance @xmath117 , which are independent of @xmath96 . to understand this effect",
    ", one can consider fig.[interf ] and realize that any ab loop process increasing the transmission from terminal 1 to terminal 3 has a partner ab loop process decreasing the transmission from 2 to 3 , characterized by the opposite ab phase dependence , and leading to a perfect cancellation of the @xmath96 dependence in the sum @xmath123 .",
    "notice that , nevertheless , spin - flipping tunneling amplitude @xmath48 do enter eq.([expr - a ] ) through the coefficients @xmath115 of each single qpc .",
    "one can thus conclude that , for the charge bias configuration  ( c ) , spin - flipping processes affect quantitatively the transmission of each single qpc , but do not lead to any qualitatively visible interference effect between the two qpcs in the conductance @xmath117 .",
    "we emphasize that this lack of dependence of @xmath96 only arises because in configuration  ( c ) terminals ( 1,2 ) are biased with the equal voltages and terminals ( 3,4 ) are grounded .",
    "it is thus not an intrinsic property of the scattering region , but a specific feature of the charge bias configuration  ( c ) . as we shall see , the behavior is different for the spin bias configuration  ( s ) .",

    "this effect , absent in the conductance @xmath117 , is highlighted in fig.[gs - fig - phifp ] , where slices of fig.[gs - fig-3d ] at fixed @xmath70 values are shown , and regions of positive and negative conductance are clearly visible . + in order to understand the physical meaning of the sign reversal and negative conductance , we first analyze the problem on the point of view of charge currents . by setting the voltage biases in configuration  ( s ) [ eq.([conf - s ] ) ] two charge currents",
    "are injected , one rightwards along the top boundary and one leftwards along the bottom boundary .",
    "the presence of qpcs induces inter - boundary coupling and modifies these currents .",
    "in particular , inter - boundary _ forward _ tunneling from one boundary opposes to the charge current counter - flowing in the other boundary , and may cause the complete blocking of the current ( i.e. @xmath141 ) or even its reversal with respect to the applied voltage bias , giving rise to negative conductance values .",
    "this is illustrated by eq.([g - s ] ) , where the conductance @xmath133 is expressed as a _ difference _ between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "negative conductance @xmath133 occurs whenever the ` crossing ' transmission @xmath83 ( describing inter - boundary forward tunneling ) overcomes the ` horizontal ' transmission @xmath82 in magnitude@xcite .",
    "this effect is in principle present also in a system of two usual quantum wires in presence of inter - wire tunneling . in ti edge states",
    ", however , helicity implies that forward tunneling processes necessarily involve a spin - flip [ see eq.([htun - sf ] ) ] , thus transferring the effect onto the spin currents as well . notice that in the spin bias configuration  ( s )",
    "the counter - flowing charge currents correspond to _ parallel _ spin currents , since the charge current injected along the top boundary is carried by an excess of spin-@xmath1 right - movers , and the charge current injected along the bottom boundary by a depletion of spin-@xmath2 right - movers [ see eq.([is - def ] ) ] .",
    "thus , in terms of spin currents , the tunneling term ( [ htun - sf ] ) effectively tends to anti - align their directions .",
    "this pictorial way also explains why negative conductance are not observed in configuration  ( c ) , where the injected spin currents are already counter - flowing .",
    "in fact , the two ab loop processes that mutually cancel in configuration  ( c ) ( see section [ sec4-c ] ) , contribute with the same sign in configuration  ( s ) .",
    "+ to conclude this section , we wish to emphasize the difference between our result of negative conductance and the one obtained in ref . [ ] for a corner junction in a quantum spin hall system . in that case",
    "the possibility that a current can flow out from the lead with the lowest applied voltage is an effect due to the strong electronic interaction .",
    "in contrast , our result shows that negative conductance values can be obtained also in the absence of electron - electron interaction , due to spin - flipping tunneling terms .",
    "furthermore , we observe that in principle negative conductance may occur also in setups with one single qpc , like the ones considered in refs . [ ] and [ ] . however , with one single qpc the value of @xmath83 may not be easily tuned : due to the linear spectrum of ti edge states , application of a gate does not lead to electron confinement , quite similarly to what occurs in graphene .",
    "the qpc parameters are thus essentially determined at fabrication level .",
    "in contrast , the presence of _ two _ qpcs gives rise to loop processes , opening the possibility to modulate @xmath83 by interferometry instead of confinement .",
    "indeed the total ` crossing ' transmission @xmath83 depends on both the single qpc ` crossing ' transmissions @xmath142 and on the ab phase @xmath96 , allowing to control the sign reversal .",
    "remarkably , sign reversal only occurs as a function of  @xmath96 and not when varying  @xmath70 . an intuitive argument to explain this property",
    "is based on the loop trajectories depicted in fig.[interf ] : as observed in section [ sec3c ] , to lowest order in the tunneling amplitudes , @xmath83 does not depend on fabry - prot processes .",
    "this property holds to all orders , though .",
    "the results presented in the previous section show that in both the ` charge'(c ) and ` spin'(s ) bias configurations a tuning of the conductance is possible operating with the gate voltages @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we recall that @xmath117 and @xmath133 represent ( up to a sign ) the linear response of charge and spin currents in terminals 3 and  4 [ see eqs.([g - c ] ) and ( [ g - s ] ) ] . in particular , this implies that the interferometer fig.[setup - fig ] allows for an all - electric tuning of the spin current , without invoking magnetic fields or polarized ferromagnets .",
    "as observed in the introduction , this feature represents an advantage in view of miniaturization with respect to spin - based devices involving magnetic materials , due to the difficulty in realizing magnetic fields at nanoscale resolution .",
    "furthermore , due to intrinsic absence of backscattering in ti edge states , the interferometer considered here exhibits typical values of the conductance maxima of the order of the conductance quantum , a relevant aspect for applications as well . in spintronics devices based on ferromagnet - normal metal hybrid junctions , for instance ,",
    "the high tunnel energy barriers severely limit transistor conductance in the ` on ' state , reducing the current delivery capability per channel .",
    "+ we now wish to comment the specific results obtained for each configuration .",
    "+ in charge bias configuration  ( c ) eq.([conf - c ] ) the conductance  @xmath117 exhibits fabry - prot oscillations as a function of the fp phase @xmath124 similar to the case of nanotubes and quantum wires .",
    "notably , in this configuration charge and spin conductances are independent of the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath96 , so that the additional degree of freedom @xmath75 provided by the edge channel space separation with respect to the case of carbon nanotubes is actually ineffective . in this respect configuration  ( c )",
    "is topologically very similar to the case of other two - terminal charge - based electron interferometers .",
    "indeed eqs.([g - c ] ) imply that , if one merges the currents flowing into terminals 3 and 4 , a _",
    "pure charge _",
    "signal is obtained , i.e. @xmath143 in accordance with the two - terminal setup analogy . nevertheless , because of the properties of ti edge states , the four terminal setup offers the advantage of performing spin - resolved measurements , since currents flowing in terminals 3 and 4 are carried by a specific majority spin component .",
    "indeed configuration ( c ) can for instance be exploited to investigate charge and spin tunneling currents through one qpc , as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , where relations similar to ( [ g - c ] ) have been found between @xmath144 and @xmath145 even in the presence of interaction .",
    "+ a richer scenario is obtained for the spin bias configuration  ( s ) [ see eq.([conf - s ] ) ] , intrinsically different from a two - terminal setup . in this case",
    "the fabry - prot oscillations of @xmath133 driven by  @xmath70 are modulated by the aharonov - bohm oscillations driven by @xmath146 . in particular a sign reversal of the conductance",
    "is possible by varying the gate voltage difference .",
    "as observed in section [ sec4-s ] , the sign reversal of the conductance is caused by the spin - flipping terms ( [ htun - sf ] ) that effectively behave as an anti - aligning coupling for the injected spin currents .",
    "furthermore , we point out that in the bias configuration  ( s ) the charge conductances in terminals 3 and 4 have equal magnitude but opposite signs , whereas the spin conductances have equal magnitudes and signs . by merging the currents flowing in terminals 3 and",
    "4 @xmath147 one obtains a _",
    "pure spin _",
    "current , a flow of electronic angular momentum that is not accompanied by any net charge current.@xcite the realization of pure spin currents represents an extremely attractive problem nowadays , for it allows to avoid charge - related spurious decoherence effects , and possibly opens new perspectives for coherent transport and quantum computing . indeed a number of schemes have been proposed to generate pure spin currents.@xcite on the other hand , the absence of any net charge current also makes the detection of pure spin currents a difficult task , which requires ad hoc methods exploiting e.g. optical techniques@xcite or spin - valve effect.@xcite the setup described here , based on ti edge states , is relatively versatile in this respect . exploiting ti edge state properties ,",
    "it allows to generate spin currents by setting the voltage biases in configuration  ( s ) , to measure them with ordinary methods ( amperometers ) in separate terminals 3 and 4 , and to adjust the conductances to the desired values by operating with the gate voltages .",
    "then , by merging the signals of terminals 3 and 4 , a pure spin current is obtained .",
    "the ballistic behavior yields values of conductances comparable with @xmath134 .",
    "these aspects are expected to contribute to make the use of spin currents a realistic perspective within a short time .",
    "+ we now provide some typical values of the relevant quantities involved in the setup , which can be realized in hgte quantum wells@xcite , where multi - terminal transport measurements have recently been performed@xcite .",
    "the period characterizing the oscillatory behavior of the conductances as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath96 , when expressed in terms of gate voltages , equals @xmath148 . assuming a distance between the two qpcs @xmath149 , and a fermi velocity@xcite @xmath150 , one obtains a value @xmath151 .",
    "the possibility for conductance sign reversal is related to the order of magnitude of @xmath83 , the ` crossing ' transmissions of the setup .",
    "the important parameter that ultimately determines @xmath83 is the value of the single qpc transmission @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "we emphasize that relatively weak spin - flipping probabilities are sufficient to obtain sign reversal . indeed ,",
    "the values @xmath135 and @xmath136 used for fig.[gs - fig-3d ] correspond to single qpc ` crossing ' transmissions @xmath154 and @xmath155 . assuming two equal qpcs",
    ", one can see from eq.([gstot - ii ] ) that the condition to observe a sign reversal can be expressed as the inequality @xmath156 in terms of the single qpc transmission probabilities .",
    "the values of @xmath152 and @xmath157 can be operatively determined by biasing only terminal 1 ( @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) and measuring the linear response of the currents in terminals 3 and 4 , respectively . +",
    "before concluding , a comment about the effect of electron - electron interaction is in order .",
    "similarly to other one - dimensional systems like carbon nanotubes or semiconductor quantum wires , in ti edge states the coulomb interaction , which is screened at short and long distances , leads to a luttinger liquid behavior@xcite . for edge states in hgte quantum wells",
    "the luttinger parameter @xmath160 , describing the strength of the screened coulomb interaction , has been estimated to range from the weakly interacting limit @xmath161  @xcite to the moderate interaction regime @xmath162  @xcite , down to the strongly interacting case @xmath163",
    "@xcite , depending on both geometrical parameters such as the quantum well thickness and the conditions of material growth .",
    "the analysis carried out here has focussed on the regime of non - interacting edge states .",
    "this has enabled us to derive a complete solution of the edge state dynamics for arbitrary values of tunneling parameters and gate voltages , which we expect to qualitatively hold for weak interaction too .",
    "in contrast , in the regime of strong interaction the scattering matrix approach is not applicable and an exact solution is not available .",
    "the use of other methods ( such as renormalization group analysis or perturbative treatments ) is mandatory@xcite , and determining the properties of the setup in the strongly interacting case represents a demanding task in general . for a single qpc or a corner junction , for instance",
    ", it has been shown that luttinger liquid signatures emerge as a power - law behavior in transport properties  @xcite .",
    "for the two qpc interferometric setup in fig.[setup - fig ] , one can speculate about interaction effects exploiting some analogies with recently studied fabry - prot interferometers in the strongly correlated regime@xcite .",
    "in particular , a modification of the oscillation periods in  @xmath70 and @xmath96 may be expected .",
    "also , in the low bias regime the non - interacting limit result may qualitatively be preserved by the finite distance between the electrodes , while luttinger liquid signatures should emerge at non - linear transport .",
    "however , we emphasize that the helical nature of edge states in topological insulators makes them intrinsically different from other luttinger liquid realizations , possibly causing the emergence of new features .",
    "furthermore , strong correlation makes edge states more sensitive to local defects such as fluctuations of ion concentration in the doping layers@xcite or random bonds at the quantum well interfaces@xcite that may even localize the edge states@xcite . for these reasons the determination of transport properties of setup fig.[setup - fig ] in the strongly interacting regime is an extremely rich and interesting problem , which deserves a separate analysis beyond the purpose of the present paper .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that interferometry of ti edge states allows to realize a full electrically controllable charge and spin transistor , without the use of magnetic fields .",
    "the charge and spin conductances of the proposed setup in fig.[setup - fig ] can be tuned by operating with electric gate voltages applied to the top and bottom regions between the two qpcs , which modify the phase of the two interference phenomena characterizing the system : fabry - prot - like loops generated by spin preserving tunneling processes and aharonov - bohm - like loops generated by spin flipping tunneling processes .",
    "two voltage bias configurations have been particularly addressed [ eqs.([conf - c])-([conf - s ] ) ] .",
    "the charge bias configuration  ( c ) leads to a conductance behavior that is qualitatively similar to the fabry - prot oscillations observed in carbon nanotubes electron interferometers , with the additional advantage of allowing for a measure of spin - resolved conductances as well . in the spin bias configuration  ( s ) ,",
    "where counter - flowing injected charge currents correspond to parallel spin currents , the fabry - prot conductance pattern is modulated by aharonov - bohm oscillations .",
    "this modulation originates from spin - flipping tunneling processes , tending to anti - aling the spin currents and leading to a current blocking or reversal with respect to the applied bias , yielding negative conductance values .",
    "furthermore , this configuration also enables to obtain a pure spin current .",
    "these peculiar features suggest that the proposed ti edge state setup may have a relevant interest for spintronics applications .",

    "<S> we investigate electron interferometry of edge states in topological insulators . we show that </S>",
    "<S> , when inter - boundary coupling is induced at two quantum point contacts of a four terminal setup , both fabry - prot - like and aharonov - bohm - like loop processes arise . </S>",
    "<S> these underlying interference effects lead to a full electrically controllable system , where the magnitude of charge and spin linear conductances can be tuned by gate voltages , without applying magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we find that , under appropriate conditions , inter - boundary coupling can lead to negative values of the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the setup also allows to selectively generate pure charge or pure spin currents , by choosing the voltage bias configuration . </S>"
