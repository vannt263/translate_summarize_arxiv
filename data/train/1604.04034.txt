    "the discovery of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interfaces between two perovskite insulators represented by the formula of abo@xmath3 , mainly laalo@xmath3 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) has attracted significant attention  @xcite .",
    "electrons in complex oxides with partially occupied d - orbitals interact with each other and with the lattice .",
    "this gives rise to a wide extraordinary electronic properties , including respectable mobility exceeding 5@xmath4 @xmath5v@xmath6s@xmath6 , low temperature superconductivity  @xcite , colossal magnetoresistivity , ferromagnetism , multiferroicity and a modulation of rashba spin - orbit coupling over a large range @xcite .",
    "therefore , oxide interfaces are exciting owing to the opportunities emerging from broken symmetry , interfacial exchange interactions and spatial confinement  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the nature of the ground state present in the complex oxide interfaces depends on the grow parameters of the laalo@xmath3 layer , its layer thickness , and the configuration of the heterostructures with different capping layers on top of laalo@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the carriers in 2deg are confined within several nanometer ( nm ) near the interface , between polar ( lao ) and non - polar ( sto ) band insulators , as a result of broken symmetry the profile of distribution has a sensitive dependence on the carrier density  @xcite .",
    "when the gate voltage and the charge carrier density are low , the 2d transport of heterointerfaces may present an inhomogeneous character since the distribution of itinerant carriers is not perfectly uniform .",
    "for instance , the charge mobility decreases versus temperature  @xcite at temperatures larger than @xmath7 k , while at low temperatures ( @xmath8 ) it increases with temperature for @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the increment of conductance versus temperature is observed for @xmath11 @xmath10 at low temperatures .",
    "the charge carrier mobility in lao / sto has been measured by many groups and they have attempted to increase the mobility using many different methods , such as lower growth temperature  @xcite , polar solvents and conducting force microscopy  @xcite .",
    "recently , sanders et al ,  @xcite measured the charge carrier mobility of doping the lao side of the lao / sto interface , where they showed that doping has little effect on electron transport and found that a power law fits to the mobility with respect to the electron density ( @xmath12 ) which behaves like @xmath1 . in addition",
    ", they explained that the mobility is steeply anti - correlated with carrier concentration , @xmath12 , at low temperatures .    to shed light on the electronic mobility of lao / sto interface and its properties ,",
    "we , in this paper , carry out a three band boltzmann equation at low temperature .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the simple three band hamiltonian with only anisotropic nearest neighbor hopping and furthermore , the screening effect is included through random phase approximation ( rpa ) . in this",
    "regard , we explain the anisotropic characteristic of the dielectric function of 2deg at the interface . this anisotropy is resulted from the presence of elliptical bands and hence dependence of the interaction on both @xmath13 and the angle between them , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the electron momentum of the corresponding bands .",
    "this structure is similar to 2deg structures where the effective mass is anisotropic and gives rise to anisotropic transport properties  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize on taking into account the variability of the dielectric constant of srtio@xmath3 with carrier density using a phenomenological relation .",
    "we show that the experimental findings are properly approved considering the dielectric constant reduction with confinement field or carrier density and also a reasonable assumption of variable impurity density .",
    "the significance of interband interactions specially at a lower carrier density is discussed and we demonstrate that the exclusion of these interactions results in even faster decrease of the mobility with carrier density .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theory and model hamiltonian are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : level1 ] where the three band boltzmann equation is derived and we further introduce the screening potential in the rpa approach .",
    "section [ sec : result ] is devoted to our analytic and numerical results for the screening and charge mobility of lao / sto interface , in the presence of charged long - range scatterers .",
    "we summarize and conclude our main findings in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "several ab - initio calculations have shown that the 2deg at the interface of band insulators laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 reside mostly on ti - t@xmath16 orbitals ( d@xmath17 , d@xmath18 , d@xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "the crystal field reduces the energy of these orbitals compared to e@xmath20 orbitals ( d@xmath21 , d@xmath22 ) by 2ev . on the other hand ,",
    "d@xmath17 orbital is lower in energy by @xmath23 due to the confinement of the electron gas along the out - of - plane axis , @xmath24 .",
    "hopping between two t@xmath16 orbitals of the ti atoms on neighboring sites is done through the overlap with the p orbitals of the oxygen atoms between them .",
    "the hopping terms which couple t@xmath16 orbitals of different symmetry are very small and therefore we can ignore them @xcite .",
    "the spatial extension of the d@xmath17 ( d@xmath18/ d@xmath19 ) orbital is larger in @xmath25 and @xmath26 with respect to @xmath27 and therefore their wave function overlap is stronger along these directions .",
    "this leads to the formation of three bands at the interface , namely ; an isotropic circular band d@xmath17 with the same light effective mass along the @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions and two anisotropic elliptic bands d@xmath18 ( d@xmath19 ) with a light mass in the @xmath29 ( @xmath28 ) direction and a heavy one along the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) direction . here",
    "we assume that the conduction electrons only occupy the lowest t@xmath16 orbitals ( even in moderate electron densities , these lowest bands contain more than @xmath30 of the electron density  @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , a minimal tight - binding hamiltonian can be written as @xcite : @xmath31[eq : h1 ] in the basis ( d@xmath17 , d@xmath18 , d@xmath19 ) .",
    "there are two other important terms contributing to the main hamiltonian of the system ; atomic spin - orbit interaction and rashba interaction  @xcite .",
    "the latter is caused by inversion symmetry breaking along @xmath24 at the interface and permits hopping between adjacent d orbitals with different parity along the @xmath24 .",
    "the combination of these two additional interactions leads to a rashba spin- orbit splitting and also orbital mixing of the bands which are highlighted near the band degeneracy points . now",
    "if we choose the carrier density of the system large enough to stay far from these points , then we can neglect the rashba spin - orbit term and the simple hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( 1 ) would be adequate to describe the properties of the system .",
    "boltzmann equation is a powerful tool to study the transport properties of an electron gas .",
    "the formalism is based on treating electrons as wave packets whose mean position and momentum obey classical equations of motion and all band structure effects appear in velocity which is related to energy dispersion .",
    "the mean free path of electrons is assumed to be much larger than their wavelength so that we can consider them as point - like quasiparticles . in this approach ,",
    "our aim is to find the nonequilibrium distribution function of charge carriers responding linearly to an external field .",
    "the relaxation - time vector is used to express the nonequilibrium part of the distribution function , which enters the boltzmann equation  @xcite . starting with the boltzmann equation in 2d and generalizing it for a multiband system we thus have @xmath32 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the carrier charge",
    ", @xmath34 is the electric field , @xmath35 is the carrier velocity in band @xmath36 which is related to the energy dispersion @xmath37 through @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the distribution function in band @xmath36 and @xmath40 is the same quantity at equilibrium .",
    "@xmath41 is the scattering rate from state @xmath42 in band @xmath36 to final state @xmath43 in band @xmath44 .",
    "since we only assume elastic scattering @xmath45 and microreversibility condition implies that @xmath46 . for spherically symmetrical scattering rates and isotropic bands , the well known relaxation time approximation would be the exact solution of the above equation .",
    "but when we have an anisotropic system , this approximation can not capture all aspects of the transport phenomena . to account for anisotropies of the bands we follow an exact integral equation approach @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath34 and @xmath14 as @xmath47 and @xmath48 and expanding the distribution function in taylor series up to linear order in @xmath34 we get @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . now substituting eq .",

    "we also define @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in anisotropic systems",
    "the velocity is not parallel to @xmath14 any more and it s magnitude is not constant in all directions .",
    "therefore , we define the angle @xmath60 as the angle between the velocity vector in band @xmath36 and @xmath61 direction . in other words , we have @xmath62 .",
    "eq . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are two independent systems of fredholm equations of the second kind and can be solved numerically provided that we can find an analytical expression for both @xmath65 and @xmath60 for each band .",
    "for the elliptical dispersion relation we can find such analytical relations as @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the angular dependence of momentum vectors of the elliptical bands at fermi surface @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 . it can be seen that for a circular band where @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 does not depend on direction any more .",
    "the scattering rate is evaluated using fermi golden rule . within the lowest order of born approximation",
    "we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the operator describing scattering and @xmath78 is the areal density of randomly distributed scatterers .",
    "finally , if we can write @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , then for elliptical bands @xmath82 would be @xmath83      to understand the nature of scattering matrix elements @xmath84 , which contain both interband and intraband terms , we should note that at low temperature the dominant scattering mechanism is charged impurity scattering .",
    "the strength of coulomb interaction between electrons and charged impurity is modified by the screening of impurities by free electrons .",
    "in addition , many - body effects due to exchange and correlations , which can be described by a local - field correction  @xcite , have been neglected in our calculations due to the lack of expressions for anisotropic systems in the literature .",
    "we thus take into account the screening effect within rpa .",

    "since d@xmath17 orbital is more confined to the interface , an effective distance @xmath91 is assumed between this orbital and other orbitals to capture this effect  @xcite , so that @xmath92 is zero except for @xmath93 .",

    "this behavior is the direct consequence of considering the variations of dielectric constant of srtio@xmath3 with the carrier density . reducing the density of carriers results in an increase in dielectric constant , so that the screening effect would become more pronounced , which leads to electrons of higher mobility .",
    "we also assume that the impurity density is not constant for the whole range of carrier density .",

    "we show the mobility of the system , assuming a constant dielectric constant @xmath152 for srtio@xmath3 .",
    "the intense reduction of the mobility by increasing the carrier density is strongly suppressed , owing to the constant dielectric constant assumption confirming the significant role of the variable dielectric constant for explaining the system appropriately .",
    "the reduction of mobility in this case is caused by assuming a variable impurity density .",
    "we should note that in the presence of a constant dielectric constant and impurity density , the mobility of the system increases with the carrier density , because the scattering centers do not change .",

    "4 , we compare the mobility of the system , both in the presence ( solid line ) and in the absence ( dashed line ) of interband interactions . a faster decrease of the mobility with respect to the carrier density is found when the interband interactions are not considered .",
    "it can be seen that the effect of these interactions is crucial , especially in lower carrier densities where @xmath13 is smaller for @xmath14 and @xmath15 in different bands and therefore the interband interaction is stronger which results in considerable reduction of the mobility . as the carrier density increases , enhancement of @xmath13 between different bands reduces the effect of interband interaction .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that although the interband scattering processes lead to the enhancement of the mobility by a factor of 2 , but it is not responsible for changing the behavior of the system effectively . in fig .",
    "4 we also show the mobility of an anisotropic 2deg with @xmath155 and the same dielectric constant variation with carrier density as the main system .",
    "the mobility plotted in this case belongs to the direction with lower effective mass . here",
    "again we can see roughly the same behavior as a result of the variable dielectric constant but the mobility is higher in this case with comparison to the t@xmath16 case , the direct result of multiband nature of the latter for which the existence of low mobility bands reduces the total mobility .",

    "we have also discussed about the contribution of each band in total mobility and concluded that although at higher carrier densities , lower mobility bands become populated -which lowers the total mobility- but this effect can not explain the observed phenomenon by itself .",
    "the significance of interband interactions specially at a lower carrier density was also discussed and we have demonstrated that the exclusion of these interactions results in even faster decrease of the mobility with carrier density .",
    "interband scattering processes were indicated to be important as well to the extent that neglecting them , the mobility approximately increases by a factor of 2 .",
    "although the overall behavior of the mobility is in agreement with experiment , the absolute value is overestimated in our calculations .",
