    "quasi two - dimensional ( q2d ) crystals ( the systems periodic and infinite in two dimensions while of atomic - size thickness ) are presently attracting much of attention because of their potential in future nano - technologies . in particular , the electronic excitations in q2d crystals , such as electron - hole pairs generation , plasmons , excitons , _ etc .",
    "_ , are of great importance , since they determine the response to external actions , and , ultimately , shape the materials functionality ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "at the same time , the theoretical approaches as well as the computational methods to deal with the excitations in q2d systems become much more involved compared to both the three - dimensional ( 3d ) and purely 2d cases , and are still far from finally established .    indeed , in both purely 3d and purely 2d cases ( the latter referring to model systems of zero thickness ) , one usually introduces the dielectric function @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the wave - vector of the corresponding dimensionality , and @xmath3 is the frequency .",
    "the definition of @xmath7 reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the externally applied and the total ( external plus induced ) scalar potentials of the electric field , respectively .",
    "the definition ( [ def ] ) is not , however , straightforwardly transferable to the q2d case , which can be easily appreciated by considering that @xmath10 depends on the @xmath11 ( perpendicular to the layer ) coordinate , even when @xmath9 is uniform in @xmath11 direction .",
    "therefore , we need to redefine the dielectric function ( energy - loss function , conductivity , _ etc . _ ) of a q2d crystal in accordance to the system s structure .",
    "importantly , the new definitions must be consistent with the quantities measured experimentally , the violation of which requirement having caused much of confusion in recent literature .",
    "secondly , the widest used at this time method of dealing with q2d systems numerically is the super - cell geometry approach .",
    "this is to artificially replicate the system periodically in @xmath11 direction , choosing the distance @xmath12 between the layers large enough to prevent the inter - layer interactions .",
    "the resulting fictitious system is 3d - periodic , and well developed 3d solid - state methods as well as the existing 3d software can be used to efficiently handle it . in the ground - state calculations , the interpretation of the super - cell results is straightforward : provided that the inter - layer distance is such that the corresponding wave - functions do not overlap , properties of an isolated single layer coincide with those of a single super - cell .",
    "however , if we are concerned with the dynamic response to electric field , the situation changes . in the case of a q2d crystal , the electric field decays into vacuum as @xmath13 . clearly , whatever large is the separation @xmath12 between the layers , at sufficiently small @xmath14 the inter - layer interaction persists , and results of the super - cell calculation can not be literally transferred to a single layer",
    ". a simple method of taking @xmath12 very large does not work , because small @xmath14-s are often of special interest , and the computational load grows rapidly with the increase of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we need to establish relations between the response functions of the fictitious 3d array system and those of the single layer of interest . the paramount requirement to these relations ( _ test for sanity _ ) is that they should produce the same response functions of a single layer from the differing 3d response functions calculated with different separations @xmath12 .    in this paper , in the framework of the time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) , we construct a scheme satisfying the above requirements . as its practical application ,",
    "we calculate and perform a detailed analysis of the excitation spectrum of a single - layer graphene in the 1 - 30 ev energy range . resolving the recent controversy in the interpretation of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 peaks as plasmons @xcite or single - particle inter - band transitions @xcite ,",
    "we show that , while the problem is far more complicated than thought before , there _ do exist _",
    "prominent @xmath4 and @xmath5 plasmons in graphene , although they overlap with the inter - band transitions .",
    "the isolation of the both kinds of excitations becomes possible by following the wave - vector dependence of spectra ( spatial dispersion ) .",
    "we also show that much of the previous confusion was due to using unsuitable theoretical quantities for comparison with experiment , as well as to the uncritical use of the results of the super - cell calculations in application to q2d systems .",

    "we use the atomic units ( @xmath15 ) unless explicitly specified otherwise .",
    "quasi-2d crystals are neither periodic three - dimensionally nor strictly two - dimensional within the mathematical plane : they rather have a finite atomic or nano - scale thickness .",
    "accordingly , one has to exercise caution in the choice of quantities ( dielectric function , conductivity , density - response function , _ etc .",
    "_ ) which characterize the dielectric response , giving them rigorous , suitable for q2d systems , meaning . the safe way to do this is to start from the general 3d case without assuming the periodicity ( translational invariance ) in any direction .",

    "a clear criterion for an excitation to be classified as plasmon is the requirement of the real - part of the dielectric function to cross zero at the corresponding energy . otherwise , if the peak at the energy - loss function is due to a peak at the imaginary part of the dielectric function , the excitation is a single - particle transition . in our case , starting from greater wave - vectors ( from @xmath109 0.05 and 0.1 a.u .",

    "the situation is similar , though less transparent , in the case of the @xmath5 peak . here , the broad feature at @xmath115 , which spreads from @xmath114 11 ev upward , is due to the overlap of the single - particle and collective excitations .",
