    "the farey fractions ( modified farey sequence ) may be defined as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denoted the _ order _ of the farey fraction at level @xmath0 .",
    "level @xmath13 consists of the two fractions @xmath14 . succeeding levels are generated by keeping all the fractions from level @xmath0 in level @xmath15 , and including new fractions .",
    "the new fractions at level @xmath16 are defined via @xmath17 and @xmath18 , so that + @xmath19 + @xmath20 + @xmath21 , etc .",
    "+ note that @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that the fractions at a given level are in increasing order .",
    "the farey fractions may also be defined using products of the @xmath23 matrices @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "our main result concerns the sum of lengths of half of the intervals between  new \" farey fractions .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] proves that the lim inf of this sum vanishes in the limit of infinite level @xmath0 .",
    "based on numerical evidence , we also conjecture that the limit of this sum vanishes .",
    "this very simple geometric property of the farey fractions is not very apparent .",
    "the intervals chosen are alternating , and there seems no obvious reason why the sum of their lengths should vanish in this limit .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the  farey tree \" , which means retaining only the @xmath26 even farey fractions at each level @xmath27 .",
    "these are exactly the new fractions at each level . in our notation",
    "they are of even order , i.e. , @xmath28 so for each level @xmath27 we obtain the set @xmath29    the lengths of the intervals between _ even _",
    "( new ) farey fractions at every level @xmath30 are denoted @xmath31 where @xmath32 . in what follows , for brevity , we abuse the terminology slightly and refer to @xmath33 as an interval . when @xmath12 itself is even ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) , we refer to these as _ even intervals_.

( note that odd and even intervals alternate . ) from the definition of the farey fractions it is easy to verify that each of the extra intervals has length @xmath40 .",
    "thus we combine them and define @xmath41 see fig .",
    "( as a result there are @xmath35 odd intervals at level @xmath0 , the same as the number of even intervals . )",

    "the dashed line in the upper diagram indicates the combining of the two  extra \" intervals into @xmath42 . in this figure and",
    "those below the intervals are not to scale.,width=302 ]    next we define total length of even intervals at level @xmath0 @xmath43 and similarly for the odd intervals @xmath44    it follows that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .    the quantity @xmath47 is the sum over the inverse squares of the new denominators at level @xmath0 . as we will see , @xmath8 is closely related to @xmath48 .    in the next section , by identifying intervals at different levels and examining their evolution from level to level , we prove our main result    [ thm1 ] @xmath49    numerical evidence ( see the last paragraph in section [ ft ] ) then leads us to the +   + * conjecture .",
    "* @xmath50    section [ relp ] contains some further remarks concerning this conjecture .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm1 ] i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "the key step is lemma [ lem7 ] , which bounds an arbitrary odd interval in terms of its  parent \" even interval at a lower level .",
    "in addition , at the end of the section we present numerical evidence for the conjecture ( [ limi ] ) .    it is convenient to use the full set of farey fractions , even though only the even ones enter @xmath3 ( see ( [ evenint ] ) ) . as mentioned , including @xmath52 and @xmath53 , there are @xmath54 fractions at level @xmath55 . in our notation , at a given level @xmath55 , the even - numbered fractions are new , having been  born \" at that level , while the odd - numbered ones are kept from the preceding level .",
    "recall , also , that the intervals in ( [ evenint ] ) are exactly the @xmath56 with @xmath12 even .",
    "[ lem2 ] for any @xmath57 we have the bounds @xmath58 and @xmath59    the rightmost inequality in ( [ oddintb ] ) follows immediately from ( [ incon ] ) .",
    "now clearly @xmath60 for any finite value of @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "if there were an @xmath61 such that @xmath62 for all @xmath0 , the left hand side of ( [ oddintb ] ) would diverge as @xmath63 .",
    "thus lemma [ lem2 ] implies theorem [ thm1 ] .    )",
    "are depicted by empty circles .",
    "note that any interval , even _ or _",
    "odd , at level @xmath0 gives rise to an odd interval at level @xmath16.,width=377 ]    we prove lemma [ lem2 ] by understanding how even and odd intervals evolve from level @xmath0 to level @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ ffl ] ) . to proceed , first note that the @xmath12th farey fraction at level @xmath0 will be at order @xmath64 in level @xmath16 .",
    "therefore we have    [ lem3 ] _ the transformation of the order for any farey fraction in going from level @xmath65 is _",
    "@xmath66    the first step in our argument involves identifying intervals at successive levels .",
    "we do this via their  middle \" farey fractions . in a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "let @xmath67 be the ",
    "middle \" farey fraction of the interval @xmath33 at level @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath68 ( see ( [ int ] ) ) .",
    "we use this to identify any set of intervals at different levels with the same  middle \" fraction @xmath67 .",
    "thus , since @xmath67 is necessarily of odd order , an interval at level @xmath0 is the  parent \" of the odd interval at level @xmath16 with the same @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that any even interval @xmath69 at level @xmath0 will produce a ( necessarily smaller ) odd interval at level @xmath16 , with @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , any odd interval produces an ( odd ) interval with the same @xmath67 at the next level ( see fig .",
    "[ ffl ] ) .",
    "in addition , there are new even intervals that are born at each level . their  middle \" fractions are the ends of the even intervals from the previous level .    at level @xmath71 , we have one even interval , which lies between the two  extra \" intervals comprising @xmath72 at the ends of the unit interval .",
    "it follows that _ all _ odd intervals at level @xmath57 ( except @xmath42 ) are born from even intervals at some previous level .",
    "further , every odd interval shrinks from level to level while preserving its  middle \" farey fraction .",
    "this establishes    [ lem3 ] for any level @xmath57 , the unit interval is covered by a set of @xmath73 alternating even and odd intervals plus the two  end \" intervals comprising @xmath42 .",
    "the even intervals are  newborn \" , while each of the odd intervals ( except @xmath42 ) is the offspring of an even interval born at a previous level .",
    "the next step is to determine what fraction of a given interval at level @xmath0 remains at level @xmath16 . in doing this ,",
    "it is useful to recall that the difference between any two successive fractions at a given level is @xmath74 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "now consider an arbitrary even interval @xmath75 at level @xmath76 ( for @xmath77 ; note that @xmath78 ) .",
    "its  middle \" fraction @xmath79 is of odd order , and was therefore carried over from level @xmath16 , where it is indexed as @xmath80 .",
    "this fraction is even , and therefore newborn at level @xmath16 .",
    "hence the neighboring fractions to its left and right , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , are odd .",
    "these two fractions , therefore , appear at level @xmath0 as @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "now the denominators of odd order fractions carry over from the previous level , i.e. , @xmath85 , while those at even order ( since they belong to  new \" farey fractions ) are the sum of their neighbors , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "putting these things together with lemma [ lem3 ] gives    [ lem4 ] for any @xmath77 and @xmath78 , i.e. , any even interval at level @xmath76 , we have @xmath87 furthermore , for any @xmath88 , @xmath89 where , for @xmath90 , ( [ lengthl ] ) includes , at level @xmath91 , all descendants of the @xmath92 even intervals at level @xmath0 .",
    "lemma [ lem4 ] is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lmr ] .    now ( except for @xmath42 ) every odd interval ( for @xmath57 ) is the descendant of a unique even interval at some lower level .",
    "therefore ( [ lengthl ] ) is valid for all @xmath93 odd intervals at any level @xmath91 with @xmath77 and @xmath94 , omitting @xmath42 . consider the identity @xmath95 . in this context",
    "it expresses the number of odd intervals at level @xmath91 in terms of a sum over the numbers of ( even ) ",
    "parent \" intervals at each lower level @xmath96 , with @xmath97 .    at this point",

    "however , the important point is that these bounds are independent of both the parent level @xmath105 and the initial ( parent ) even interval .",

    "+   + * proof of lemma [ lem2 ] : * the remainder of the proof is as follows .",
    "first , relabel the ",
    "parent \" level in lemma [ lem7 ] as @xmath118 .",
    "if we fix @xmath119 , since @xmath105 varies over the range @xmath120 , @xmath103 satisfies @xmath121 .",
    "thus all the odd intervals at an arbitrary level @xmath0 are included , except the ",
    "end \" interval @xmath122 . the leftmost inequality in ( [ oddintb ] ) and the inequality in ( [ oddintupb ] )",
    "then follow directly on summing ( [ sumratio ] ) and using ( [ int1 ] ) .",
    "finally , a. zhigljavsky @xcite has verified numerically , up to level @xmath123 , that @xmath3 continues to decrease as @xmath0 increases .",
    "his results are consistent with the result that @xmath124 as @xmath63 found in @xcite .",
    "the conjecture ( [ limi ] ) is , as already pointed out , very simple .",
    "however a proof is apparently quite elusive , at least using the methods employed in this paper . even establishing that @xmath48 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath0 , which , given ( [ liminfi ] )",
    ", would be sufficient , appears very non - trivial .",
    "however several recent approaches to proving this conjecture have been proposed ( @xcite ) , based , respectively , on the chacon - ornstein ergodic theorem , continued fractions , and a measure theoretic analysis .",
    "the problem treated here arose from previous investigations of the farey fraction spin chains , a set of statistical mechanical models based on the farey fractions ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "it follows directly from their definitions that the  farey tree partition function \" @xmath125 ( see equation ( 7 ) in @xcite ) satisfies @xmath126 , while the  even knauf partition function \" @xmath127 ( see the equation after ( 3 ) in @xcite ) satisfies @xmath128 .    therefore the inequality ( 13 ) , proven in @xcite , can be rewritten as @xmath129 which immediately proves    [ lem1 ] the conjecture ( [ limi ] ) is equivalent to @xmath130    note that the term  partition function \" is used in its statistical mechanical sense here , which in general has no connection with the number theoretic usage .    since this paper was written , as mentioned in section [ ptc ] , several proofs of conjecture ( [ limi ] ) using different methods have been proposed .",
    "the method employed here does not seem capable of establishing conjecture ( [ limi ] ) , however it gives detailed information about the evolution of the intervals not otherwise available .",
    "there are several spin chains known to have the same free energy , and thus the same thermodynamic behavior .",
    "they all exhibit a second - order phase transition at non - zero temperature .",
    "( the free energy is defined via @xmath131 , and a phase transition is a singularity in @xmath132 ",
    "see @xcite for more details on these matters . )",
    "the farey tree model is employed in @xcite for a study of multifractal behavior associated with chaotic maps exhibiting intermittency .",
    "the critical point ( phase transition ) in this model occurs at @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , physically , @xmath134 is the value of the partition function at the critical point .",
    "( the value of the partition function at one point is , however , generally of no physical interest . )    in proving that the free energy of the farey tree model is the same as the free energy for other farey statistical models , it was already demonstrated @xcite that as @xmath63 , @xmath135 for @xmath136 , while @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "( this , incidentally , also establishes that the hausdorff dimension is @xmath139 . ) however , exactly at the critical point , it was only shown that @xmath140 . to our knowledge",
    ", the result ( [ liminfi ] ) found here , and extended by @xcite , is new .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite contains some related work , giving results on the large @xmath0 behavior of the quantity @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
