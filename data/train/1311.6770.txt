    ", supersymmetry is the most promising extension for the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in particular , the scalar masses can be stabilized , and the superpotential is non - renormalizable .",
    "because gravity is also very important in the early universe , it seems to us that supergravity theory is a natural framework for inflation model building  @xcite .",
    "however , supersymmetry breaking scalar masses in a generic supergravity theory are of the same order as the gravitino mass , giving rise to the so - called @xmath17 problem  @xcite , where all the scalar masses are of the order of the hubble parameter because of the large vacuum energy density during inflation  @xcite .",
    "there are two elegant solutions : no - scale supergravity  @xcite , and shift - symmetry in the khler potential  @xcite .",
    "the planck satellite may measure the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 down to 0.03 - 0.05 in one or two years .",
    "the future qubic experiment targets to constrain at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) the tensor - to - scalar ratio of 0.01 with one year of data taking from the concordia station at @xmath18 c , antarctica  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the well - known lyth bound on tensor - to - scalar ratio is 0.01  @xcite .",
    "thus , the interesting question is how to construct inflation models which can be consistent with the planck results and have large tensor - to - scalar ratio . for recent studies ,",

    "@xcite .    according to the planck observations , the simple chaotic inflation models based on power law potentials @xmath12 are out of @xmath6 region  @xcite due to the large tensor - to - scalar ratio . in this paper",
    ", we will modify the simple power law potentials by multiplying an exponential term as follows @xmath19 where the parameter @xmath20 relates to the energy scale of inflation , and @xmath21 reveals the importance of exponential term . for simplicity ,",
    "we take the planck scale as unity @xmath22 unless explicitly specified .",
    "these potentials with a constraint @xmath23 have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) , where the expansion scale factor @xmath24 is adopted . besides , a concrete example , @xmath25 with a non - canonical kinetic term for @xmath26 is obtained in ripple inflation from the modified no - scale supergravity  @xcite .",
    "we show that the above inflaton potentials can be realized in the supergravity theory with an small shift symmetry breaking term in khler potential . because we do not consider the non - renormalizable terms in khler potential , there are two cases for @xmath27 : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we find that the models with ( @xmath1 ) , ( @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath3 ) , and ( @xmath4 ) can be highly consistent with the planck observations .",
    "especially , the tensor - to - scalar ratio is larger than @xmath5 in the @xmath6 region , above the well - known lyth bound  @xcite .",
    "thus , these models produce the typical large field inflation , and can be tested at the future planck and qubic experiments .",
    "the first step to realize inflation in supergravity is to get sufficient flat direction in the inflaton potential .",
    "the scalar potential in the supergravity theory with given khler potential @xmath30 and superpotential @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the inverse of the khler metric @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "for the canonical khler potential @xmath36 , without miracle cancellation in eq .",
    "( [ sgp ] ) , the scalar potential @xmath37 contains a term @xmath38 . because it is very steep in the region with @xmath39 , no slow - roll inflation can be realized for such potential .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath17 problem , the major difficulty to achieve inflation in supergravity .",
    "the @xmath17 problem can be naturally solved in the no - scale supergravity  @xcite , in which the khler potential satisfies the flatness condition @xmath40 , and the scalar potential can be arranged to be sufficient flat for inflation .    for general supergravity with a polynomial khler potential ,",
    "normally the scalar potential varies significantly above the planck scale .",
    "interestingly , with a certain symmetry , one can decouple the inflaton from the khler potential .",
    "so the inflaton does not appear in the @xmath41 term of the potential , and then no @xmath17 problem in this direction .",
    "this fact , which provides another solution to @xmath17 problem , realizes inflation in supergravity  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the khler potential @xmath30 is invariant under the shift symmetry @xmath42 with @xmath43 a dimensionless real parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ , the khler potential @xmath30 is a function of @xmath44 and independent on the imaginary part of @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , it forms a flat direction along the imaginary part of @xmath45 , and inflation may be triggered along this flat path .",
    "based on the fact that shift symmetry can keep the inflaton away from the @xmath17 problem , several inflation models in supergravity were proposed  @xcite . as the inflation models with power law potentials are disfavored by the planck observations , the supergravity inflation models with polynomial potentials have been studied recently  @xcite . in those works ,",
    "the khler potentials are constrained by the shift symmetry in certain direction , while the superpotentials are generalized to be polynomial potentials .    in the following ,",
    "we will obtain the potential @xmath46 in supergravity by introducing a new term in khler potential which slightly breaks the shift symmetry . because the mass dimension of khler potential is two",
    ", we will not consider the models with @xmath47 in this paper .",
    "the detailed studies for the inflation models with spontaneous shift symmetry breaking and the inflation models with @xmath47 will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "the khler potential and superpotential used to get the potential @xmath50 are @xmath51 in which the term @xmath52 has the shift symmetry @xmath53 .",
    "this symmetry is broken by the linear term @xmath54 .",
    "as shown later , the shift symmetry breaking term introduces an exponential term @xmath55 in the potential , which is crucial to fit the planck results . actually , the model in eq .",
    "( [ kah1 ] ) is equivalent to the supergravity theory with canonical khler potential and superpotential as follows @xmath56 the new superpotential leads to the  miracle cancellation \" , which plays the same role as the shift symmetry of khler potential in eq .",
    "( [ kah1 ] ) to solve the @xmath17 problem .",
    "in addition , our model is equivalent to the supergravity model in refs .",

    "for the khler potential in eq .",
    "( [ kah2 ] ) , taking the complex field @xmath83 , we obtain the exponential term in scalar potential @xmath84 all the other components in the potential are identical to the above scenario with @xmath28 .",

    "the @xmath87 relation will be significantly improved because of the following two points : ( 1 ) the potentials will become flatter due to exponential terms and more suitable for inflation ; ( 2 ) the exponential term introduces one more free parameter @xmath21 , which can be adjusted to fit the observation data .    the inflaton scalar potentials in eq .",
