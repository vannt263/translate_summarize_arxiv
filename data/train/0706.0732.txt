    ", the minimum @xmath5 may fall below the roche radius ( @xmath20 ) and the planet may be destroyed . however , there are a number of competing torques that can limit the amount of angular momentum that the kozai torque can extract from the orbit of the planet , including general relativistic ( gr ) corrections to newtonian gravity , and torques associated with the extended mass distribution of both the primary star and the planet .",
    "the latter includes rotationally induced planetary oblateness , the tidal bulge raised by the star on the planet , the misalignment of this bulge produced by friction , and the stellar counterparts of all these .",
    "these torques can halt the kozai - induced collapse in @xmath5 and promote planetary survival .",
    "which torque becomes competitive with the kozai torque depends on the system ; for systems with very large binary semi - major axis ( @xmath21 ) and therefore very weak kozai torque , the gr precession can halt the reduction of @xmath5 before tides become important .",
    "however , for tighter or more inclined binaries , tidal friction sets the minimum @xmath5 .",
    "since the tidal torques depend strongly on @xmath5 , binary systems with a wide range of @xmath22 will be stalled at essentially the same @xmath5 , leading to a pile - up of hot jupiters at @xmath23 when the planet orbits are later circularized .",
    "we quantify the effect of kozai migration by considering an ensemble of binary systems following that in @xcite .",
    "these binaries are initially comprised of a solar - mass host star , a jupiter - mass planet ( @xmath24 ) orbiting at @xmath25 au with an eccentricity of @xmath26 , and a binary companion of mass @xmath27  this is the peak of the observed mass ratio distribution in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",

    "the results should be taken with caution at present .",

    "our hot jupiters exhibit a pile - up at @xmath53 day periods similar to the observed population ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "given the same initial @xmath19 , tighter binaries produce a closer - in hot jupiter in a shorter amount of time . many of the hot jupiters are tidally ensnared on their first close approach to the host star ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , with the kozai period between @xmath41 to @xmath54 yrs . tidal circularization of these orbits then takes upward of @xmath55 years .",
    "the 3-day feature in the computed @xmath35 distribution appears wider than the observed distribution .",
    "however , as just noted , closer - in planets are migrated in earlier , so they still have larger radii and larger stalling peraipses . experimenting with the following time evolution of planet radius , r_p = r_j , with @xmath56 taken to be @xmath57 , we find that the 3-day bump narrows significantly ( fig .

    "the periapse of a kozai - migrating planet is stalled at a distance where the eccentricity forcing due to the binary companion is counteracted by the eccentricity damping by tidal dissipation .",

    "coincidentally , @xmath66 , and it depends little on a variety of parameters , including stellar mass , companion mass , planet mass , planet tidal @xmath67 factor , and planet initial orbit .",
    "this justifies our choices for these parameters in the numerical experiment .. ] in our simulation , most binaries that give rise to hot jupiters have @xmath68 $ ] au ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) and we have scaled @xmath21 here by roughly the median value .",
    "tighter binaries are relatively unimportant  planets in many of these systems are dynamically unstable and are excluded from our study .",
    "the fraction of stars with kozai migrated hot jupiters is given by f _",
    "< 0.1 = f_bf_pf_kozai , where @xmath70 is the fraction of stars in binary systems , @xmath71 is the fraction of solar type stars with jupiter mass planets formed at a few au , and @xmath72 is the fraction of planets in binary star systems that undergo kozai migration to @xmath73au .",
    "taking @xmath74 @xcite , @xmath75 @xcite , and @xmath76 ( this work ) , we suggest that , at a minimum , @xmath9 of the known hot jupiters may be due to kozai migration .",
    "the most uncertain number is @xmath71 .",
    "the value of @xmath71 we have quoted is the observed fraction in the keck sample , which is substantially complete up to @xmath77 . assuming the number of planets per @xmath78 is flat up to @xmath79 gives @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "there is some indication that the number of planets per @xmath78 is an increasing function of @xmath35 . if @xmath82 , more than half the hot jupiters could be produced by the kozai mechanism .",
    "the number of hot jupiters produced by kozai migration can be determined by observations in the near future , since kozai migrated planets must have a number of attributes .",
    "first , candidate kozai hot jupiters will reside in binary star systems , although the binary mass ratio may well be small ; a brown dwarf companion can be dynamically as effective as a solar - type companion ( eq . [ [ eq : bcrit ] ] ) .",
    "the study by @xcite establishes that @xmath83 of the stars in the solar neighbourhood are actually binary or triple systems .",
    "while radial velocity surveys select against close binaries , studies by @xcite show that at least @xmath84 of radial velocity planet hosts have stellar companions .",
    "the discoveries of brown - dwarf companions to the planet bearing stars hd 3651 @xcite and hd 89744 @xcite highlight the possibility that the existence of dim companions will increase the known binary fraction of planet bearing stars significantly .",
    "the kozai scenario predicts that the binary fraction of hot jupiters will be higher than that of systems with more distant planets .",
    "binary - induced radial velocity trends induced on the primary by a stellar companion will be of order 5f(m_c0.3 m _ ) ( 100aua_c)^2//yr , where @xmath85 is the sine of the angle between the line of sight and the stellar velocity .",
    "this is clearly detectable at the current sensitivity of radial velocity surveys @xcite .",
    "the companion will also induce an astrometric acceleration of a few micro - arcsecond / yr / yr , detectable by sim or gaia .",
    "second , kozai systems have @xmath86 $ ] , with @xmath87 not uncommon ( fig . [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) . in transiting systems the binary orbit will be in or near the plane of the sky .",
    "this can be tested via both radial velocity and astrometry .",
    "third , the angle between the spin axis of the primary star ( assumed to be the orbit normal of the planet at formation ) and the present - day planet orbit normal will range from 0 to 130 degrees ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) with the values between 0 and 50 degrees being preferred .",
    "this angle can be determined if both the spin period of the star as well as its rotational velocity @xmath88 can be independently measured .",
    "the angle projected onto the plane of the sky , measurable using the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , will have a similar range .",
    "fourth , the semimajor axis ratio @xmath89 with any second planet will be small .",
    "this results from the requirement that the precession rate induced by the second planet not break the kozai resonance @xcite .",
    "radial velocity measurements can constrain the mass and semimajor axis of any nearby planetary companions to hot jupiters @xcite . a corollary",
    "is that the fraction of multiplanet systems having hot jupiters will be smaller than the fraction of single planet systems with hot jupiters .",
    "kozai - migrated planets dissipate many times their own binding energy during tidal circularization .",
    "@xcite find that tidally dissipated energy is deposited throughout the bulk of the planet , raising the possibility that the planet will expand catastrophically .",
    "in contrast , @xcite concludes that energy is deposited exclusively near the photosphere , which would leave the planet intact .",
    "the theoretical situation is unclear , but the existence of hot jupiters suggests an answer . a plot of @xmath12 versus @xmath35 strongly suggests that the low @xmath12 s of the hot jupiters are the result of tidal circularization , as the observed @xmath12 s follow closely the upper - bound set by the tidal process ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "if so , most or all hot jupiters have experienced rapid tidal heating and survived . another concern with the kozai picture is raised by the rossiter - mclaughlin measurement of stellar obliquity , currently available for 5 transiting planets ( see table 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "all are consistent with zero obliquity .",
    "taken at face value , this is at variance with the above kozai prediction .",
    "star with a massive planet , may have experienced tidal synchronization in its surface - layer that would alter its apparent rotation axis . ]      in kozai migration , it is important that @xmath5 evolves on a time scale no shorter than the tidal precession time scale ; if @xmath5 were to suddenly plunge from above to below the roche radius , as for example would be the case if two planets suffered a close encounter , the inward scattered planet would not be stalled outside @xmath20 .",
    "instead it would suffer rapid mass loss and likely be lost . in that case there will be a cut - off in the distribution of @xmath35 at @xmath90@xcite , but not a pile - up .    migration in a gas disk may also produce hot jupiters . if the disk extends all the way to the star , one would observe a cut - off at @xmath91 ; if the disk is truncated , e.g. , by stellar magnetic fields @xcite , a feature will appear at an orbital period half that of the inner edge of the disk . however , spin periods and magnetic fields of accreting stars show a substantial dispersion , which would lead to a rather broad distribution in the disk inner radii , and hence a smeared out feature in the distribution of planetary semimajor axis .",
    "we have studied the role of a binary companion in increasing @xmath12 and causing a gradual collapse in @xmath5 .",
    "but it is also plausible that soft planet - planet scattering can gradually decrease @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "moreover , kozai oscillations can also be excited by a second planet , in the absence of a binary stellar companion .",
    "as long as these or other processes produce gentle eccentricity driving on @xmath41 to @xmath54 year timescales , tidal effects will halt the periapse evolution when @xmath92 .",
    "tidal circularization then pushes the planets out to @xmath93 and produces a narrow pile - up of hot jupiters there .                                        ,",
