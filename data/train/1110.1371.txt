    "the alexander biquandle of an oriented classical or virtual knot or link is a module over a ring of 2-variable laurent polynomials which is invariant under virtual reidemeister moves . in this paper",
    "we describe methods of obtaining computable invariants of classical and virtual knots and links from the alexander biquandle .",
    "these families of invariants generalize and unify the classical alexander polynomials for classical knots and the generalized alexander polynomial for virtual knots and links ( also known as the _ virtual alexander polynomial _ @xcite and the _ sawollek polynomial _",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath1 .",
    "this work was inspired by the remark following theorem 3 in sawollek s paper @xcite which states ,  for a connected sum @xmath2 of virtual link diagrams @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a formula of the form @xmath5 with a constant @xmath6 does not hold in general ... \" this is not surprising since the connected sum of virtual knots and links is not well - defined , yet in certain cases the result nevertheless holds .",
    "computing the virtual alexander polynomial of various connected sums of virtual knots reveals that , as anticipated , these polynomials differed depending on where the connect sum is performed .",
    "moreover , these polynomials gave no indication of where the connect sum was taken .",
    "it is natural , then , to ask under what circumstances does @xmath1 satisfy the above equation . since the classical alexander polynomial generates the @xmath7 elementary ideal of the alexander matrix , we expect the factor relationship of the polynomials of connected summands to result in an inclusion relationship at the level of ideals . to begin our study of such relationships , therefore , we turned our attention to describing these ideal - valued invariants in more detail as a first step .",
    "the result is the present paper ; we anticipate future work taking these ideas further .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ vaq ]",
    "we recall the alexander biquandle . in section [ p ]",
    "we define invariants of oriented virtual and classical knots and links derived from the alexander biquandle using principal ideals . in section [ g ]",
    "we use reduced grbner bases to define further invariants from the alexander biquandle .",
    "in section [ ce ] we collect some computations and examples .",
    "we conclude with some questions for future work in section [ q ] .",
    "recall from @xcite that an _ oriented virtual link _ is an equivalence class of _ oriented virtual link diagrams _ under the equivalence relation defined by the _",
    "virtual reidemeister moves _ , obtained by considering all possible oriented versions of the moves pictured below : @xmath8 @xmath9@xmath10",
    "we now review the definitions of the virtual biquandle and the fundamental virtual biquandle . this second definition will allow us to see the relationship between biquandles and virtual knots .",
    "we note that these axioms result from by applying the labeling condition pictured below to the virtual reidemeister moves . for instance , the invertibility of @xmath11 and @xmath12 along with axiom ( 1 ) represent reidemeister 2 moves .",
    "reidemeister 1 moves are represented by axiom ( 2 ) , and reidemeister 3 moves are related to axiom ( 3 ) .",
    "suppose we are given a virtual knot or link @xmath13 with fixed diagram .",
    "let @xmath14 be a set of generators that are in one - to - one correspondence with the set of _ semiarcs _ in @xmath13 , i.e. the portions of the virtual knot or link between crossing points ( whether virtual , classical over or classical under ) .",
    "the set of _ virtual biquandle words in @xmath15 _ , denoted @xmath16 , is defined recursively by the rules :    * @xmath17 implies @xmath18 and * @xmath19 implies @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the _ free virtual biquandle on @xmath15 _ , denoted @xmath22 , is the set of equivalence classes of virtual biquandle words in @xmath15 under the equivalence relation on @xmath16 generated by the virtual biquandle axioms .",
    "we remark that @xmath22 gives provides almost no information about our original knot or link @xmath13 . in order to capture information contained in our fixed diagram of @xmath13 , we mod out by relations suggested by the crossings to obtain the fundamental virtual biquandle .",
    "the _ fundamental virtual biquandle of @xmath13 _ , denoted @xmath23 , is the set of equivalence classes of @xmath22 under the equivalence relation generated by the _ crossing relations _ in @xmath13 : @xmath24 alternatively , we can describe @xmath23 more directly as the set of equivalence classes in @xmath16 under the equivalence relation generated by both the crossing relations and the virtual biquandle axioms .",
    "let @xmath13 be a virtual link written as a closed virtual braid @xmath25 , that is @xmath26 .",
    "the fundamental virtual biquandle of a virtual link @xmath13 is isomorphic to the fundamental virtual biquandle of the link @xmath27 obtained from @xmath13 by reversing the direction of all strands in the closure of the inverse braid @xmath28 .",
    "the proof is effectively the same as the analogous result for classical biquandles of virtual links in @xcite ; we provide an illustration .",
    "consider the virtual link @xmath29 given by the closure of the braid @xmath30 the reversed inverse braid closure @xmath31 has isomorphic virtual biquandle ( indeed , with identical presentation ) to that of @xmath32 @xmath33 while the unreversed inverse braid closure @xmath34 has a generally distinct virtual biquandle :    @xmath35    @xmath36    an important example of a virtual biquandle , and one to which we will devote considerable attention , is the alexander biquandle .",
    "we begin with some notation .",
    "let @xmath37 $ ] be the ring of laurent polynomials in two variables @xmath38 .",
    "we can think of @xmath39 as a quotient ring of the four - variable polynomial ring @xmath40 $ ] by the ideal @xmath41    a straightforward check verifies that the alexander biquandle of a virtual knot is invariant under virtual reidemeister moves ; see @xcite for details .",
    "we can represent the alexander biquandle of a virtual knot or link with the coefficient matrix of the homogeneous system of equations determined by the crossings , known as a _",
    "presentation matrix_.    [ ex1 ] @xmath42\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath43.\\ ] ]    it is well - known that :    the elementary ideals of a module over a commutative ring with identity do not depend on the choice of presentation matrix for the module .    in particular , any two presentation matrices of",
    "the same module differ by a sequence of moves of the forms :    * reordering of rows or columns , * adding or deleting a row of all zeroes , * adding or deleting a row and column with a @xmath44 in the intersection and all other entries @xmath45 , * adding a scalar multiple of one row ( or column , respectively ) to another row ( or column , respectively ) , or * replacing a row or column by an invertible scalar multiple of itself .",
    "one then checks that these moves do not change the ideal .",
    "for instance , switching the order of two rows will multiply the minors by @xmath46 , but this does not change the ideal since @xmath46 is a unit . similarly , multilinearity of the determinant ensures that adding a scalar multiple of one row to another does not change the minors , etc .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "it then follows that :    let @xmath13 be a virtual link and let @xmath47 be a presentation matrix for @xmath48 .",
    "then the elementary ideals @xmath49 of @xmath47 are invariants of virtual isotopy .    in order to compare ideals , we need some machinery . in the next sections we describe two methods for comparing the ideals",
    "in this section we employ the tried and true method of obtaining invariants from @xmath49 using principal ideals , i.e. ideals generated by a single element of @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the classical alexander polynomials can be obtained by the analogous construction starting with a presentation matrix for the the alexander quandle , which is the special case of the alexander biquandle with @xmath51 or equivalently the result of specializing @xmath52 in @xmath53 . in the literature , @xmath54 is known as the _",
    "generalized alexander polynomial _ or _ virtual alexander polynomial _ , and , after a change of variables , the _ sawollek polynomial _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , specializing @xmath52 in @xmath55 for classical links yields the classical alexander polynomial @xmath56 .",
    "[ corresp ] @xmath57 @xmath58    since a virtual knot always has @xmath48 presented by a square matrix , the top level @xmath59 ideal is always principal , generated by the determinant of the presentation matrix . to compute @xmath60 for @xmath61 , we can find the @xmath62-minors of the presentation matrix , and after multiplying by units if necessary to get elements of the ufd ( unique factorization domain ) @xmath63 $ ] , find the greatest common divisor .",
    "the principal polynomials @xmath64 have the advantages of being fairly quick to compute and easy to compare ; however , for any principal ideal @xmath65 , there are potentially many distinct non - principal ideals contained in @xmath66 , and thus passing from @xmath49 to @xmath67 represents a loss of information . to avoid this loss of information",
    ", we can employ the idea of a grbner basis .",
    "briefly , in a multivariable polynomial ring @xmath68 $ ] over a pid ( principal ideal domain ) @xmath69 , a _ term ordering _ is a well - ordering on the set of monomials ; such an ordering then gives each polynomial a well - defined _ leading term .",
    "_ standard examples of term orderings include :    * _ lexicographical ordering . _ starting with an ordering on the variables , e.g. @xmath70 , one compares terms by comparing powers on the variables in order , with ties in one variable resolved by comparing the next . for example , if @xmath71 then we have @xmath72 * _ graded lexicographical ordering . _ here we start by comparing total degree , with ties broken lexicographically .",
    "thus for the previous example in graded lexicographical ordering we have @xmath73    a generating set @xmath74 for an ideal @xmath75 in a polynomial ring is a _ grbner basis _ for @xmath75 with respect to a choice of term ordering @xmath0 if the leading term of every element of @xmath75 is divisible by the leading term of some element of @xmath74 .",
    "grbner basis have many useful properties , such as :    * reducing a polynomial @xmath76 by @xmath74 using the multivariable division algorithm ( i.e. repeatedly subtracting from @xmath77 multiples of elements of @xmath74 to cancel leading terms ) always results in @xmath45 ( this is not true for arbitrary generating sets ) , and * the remainder of a polynomial after multivariable division by @xmath74 is unique , enabling computations in the quotient ring @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , a grbner basis is _ reduced _ if redundant elements have been removed , i.e. if every leading term has coefficient @xmath44 and no monomial in any element @xmath79 is in the ideal generated by the leading terms of @xmath80 .",
    "importantly for us , for a given choice of term ordering , reduced grbner bases of ideals are unique .",
    "thus , we would like to compare the ideals @xmath49 by finding and comparing grbner bases .",
    "one slight problem is that @xmath50 $ ] is a ring of _ laurent _ polynomials , not polynomials . to address this",
    ", we will pull back from the ring @xmath39 to the four - variable polynomial ring @xmath40 $ ] in which @xmath81 and @xmath82 are considered new variables as opposed to powers of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    to compute @xmath85 , one uses _",
    "buchberger s algorithm _",
    "@xcite starting by setting @xmath74 equal to the set of @xmath62-minors together with the generators @xmath86 and @xmath87 . for each pair of elements @xmath88",
    ", we find a difference @xmath89 using the least common multiple of the leading terms of @xmath90 and @xmath91 such that that the leading terms of @xmath92 and @xmath93 cancel . after reducing @xmath94 mod @xmath74 ,",
    "if the remainder is nonzero , add it to @xmath74 and start over .",
    "when no more polynomials are added , we have a grbner basis .",
    "we then remove elements whose monomials lie in the ideal generated by the leading terms of the other elements of @xmath74 to obtain the reduced grbner basis , unique up to choice of term ordering @xmath0 .",
    "see @xcite for more .",
    "since the resulting sets of polynomials can be quite large , we may employ various strategies to obtain more conveniently comparable invariants at the cost of losing some information .",
    "these include but are certainly not limited to :    * _ alexander - grbner cardinality . _ the number of elements in the grbner basis of @xmath95 , @xmath96 ; * _ alexander - grbner sum . _ the sum of the elements of @xmath85 , @xmath97 and * _ alexander - grbner maximum polynomial .",
    "_ the maximal element of @xmath85 with respect to the term ordering @xmath0 , @xmath98 .",
    "we note that the last two invariants coincide with the principal polynomials when the ideals @xmath49 are principal ; while the first invariant is @xmath44 iff the ideal @xmath49 is prinicpal .",
    "we provide several examples that justify our proposed generalizations of the sawollek and other alexander - type polynomials . in each of the examples below we use the graded lexicographical ordering on @xmath99 .",

    "interpreting the base point as the point at infinity yields the long knot interpretation .",
    "@xmath108    our motivation for considering based virtual knots is the observation that while the connected sum operation is not well - defined for virtual knots , it _ is _ well - defined for based virtual knots provided we only permit the summing operation at the base point .",

    "meanwhile , the based virtual biquandle has @xmath111 relations : two coming from each of the @xmath109 crossings , as usual .",
