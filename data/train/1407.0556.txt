    "consider the ordinary differential equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 , the dots denote derivatives with respect to time @xmath2 , the driving force @xmath3 is smooth and @xmath4-periodic with respect to its arguments and the damping coefficient @xmath5 depends on time . for concreteness we shall consider explicitly the case of a pendulum with oscillating support , which is described by an ordinary differential equation of the form @xmath6 but our results apply to systems with more general forces , or even systems of the form @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , such as those considered in @xcite .    with a few exceptions , forced systems of the form have been studied only in the case of constant dissipation . despite the simplicity of the model ,",
    "not much is known analytically .",
    "for instance only a finite set of attractors are expected to exist @xcite , but no proof exists for this .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding basins of attraction are usually calculated only numerically ; see for example @xcite . to add complication , in many physical systems",
    "the damping coefficient is not constant throughout its entire evolution .",
    "time - dependent dissipation has been studied in @xcite , where the focus was mainly on the case of @xmath9 varying linearly over some initial time span , say @xmath10 $ ] , after which it remains constant . in that case , as discussed in the quoted papers , only considering the final value of the damping coefficient does not give a correct representation of the basins of attraction and the entire time evolution of @xmath9 must be taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of a system with constant damping coefficient @xmath11 may provide information for the same system with damping coefficient varying in time . for fixed constant @xmath11 ,",
    "consider an attractor and denote by @xmath12 the relative area of the corresponding basin of attraction , that is the percentage of initial data in a given sample region whose trajectories go to that attactor .",
    "it has already been pointed out in @xcite that , if one knows the profiles @xmath13 describing how the relative areas of the basins of attraction depend on @xmath11 in the system with constant dissipation , then , when @xmath9 varies quasi - statically ( that is very slowly ) from an initial value @xmath14 towards a final value @xmath15 over a time @xmath16 , one may be able to predict the relative areas of the basins by looking only at the profiles , and the slower the variation of the damping coefficient , the better the prediction .",
    "more precisely , at least in the perturbation regime , if an attractor exists for @xmath17 , then , when @xmath9 increases slowly towards the value @xmath15 , the relative area of the corresponding basin of attraction is close to the value that the function @xmath12 attains for @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the larger @xmath19 , the closer the relative area will be to this value .    in this paper , we want to discuss other cases , where knowledge of the behaviour of the system for constant @xmath11 may be used in the case in which dissipation changes in time .",
    "in particular , we shall discuss the following :    1 .",
    "suppose that one is interested in investigating systems with @xmath9 varying linearly from an initial value @xmath20 to a final value @xmath15 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 fixed , over a time interval @xmath22 $ ] , for many values of @xmath16 . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we outline a method to speed up the computation of the basins of attraction .",
    "the method utilises basins of attraction calculated for the system with constant damping coefficient @xmath15 , and it reduces the length of time over which it is necessary for the equations of motion to be numerically integrated . in effect , our method is to extrapolate from an observation time @xmath23 to the full evolution time @xmath24 , by using pre - computed data .",
    "we will refer to this as ` the method of fast numerical computation ' .",
    "this is first stated as a general method and later numerically implemented for the pendulum with oscillating support .",
    "2 .   in section [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we come back to a phenomenon observed in @xcite .",
    "when the damping coefficient increases linearly over a time @xmath16 towards a final value @xmath15 , the relative areas of the basins of attraction of the surviving attractors most of time change smoothly as functions of @xmath16 , without abrupt variations ; however , in a few cases we saw sharp jumps , concentrated in small intervals of values of @xmath16  see figure [ basinjumps ] . by using the same ideas as in the method of fast numerical computation , we offer an explanation of why this happens .",
    "the method of fast numerical computation can be described as follows .",
    "assume that the basins of attraction of a system of the form with constant @xmath25 are known .",
    "of course , this information can only be obtained numerically and requires integration of the equations of motion for a time @xmath24 large enough for the attractors to be closely approached .",
    "then , if one is interested in investigating a system of the form with @xmath9 varying in time from an initial value @xmath20 to the final value @xmath21 over a time @xmath16 much smaller than @xmath24 , the corresponding basins of attraction can be obtained by integrating the differential equation over a time interval @xmath26 $ ] , with @xmath27 still much smaller than the entire time evolution @xmath24 . as a result the computation time is reduced by a factor @xmath28 ; for example , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , simulations take under 12 hours to complete , compared with nearly 10 days for the simulations using full time @xmath24 .",
    "roughly , @xmath31 is the time needed for the trajectories to fall inside the basins of attraction at constant @xmath32 , so that their evolution from that instant onwards is known  we refer to section [ sec:3 ] for more details .",
    "this method of calculating the basins of attraction can significantly reduce computation time when the number of values of @xmath16 to investigate is large , particularly for systems which require long time integration or where computationally heavy integration methods are needed . assuming dissipation to increase with time is very natural from a physical point of view , as an effect of wear , aging , cooling , the build up of deposits and so on .",
    "a linear increase may seem less natural ; however , in addition to being particularly well - suited for numerical investigation , it also simulates situations where dissipation tends to settle around some asymptotic value , which again are of physical interest ; we refer to @xcite for further comments .",
    "therefore , in this paper we have focused on the linear case .",
    "nevertheless we expect our results to apply in more general contexts , where the variation of the damping coefficient is not linear ( or not even monotonic ) , or the final value is reached only asymptotically .",
    "the results produced by the method of fast numerical computation show good agreement with the results obtained by integrating the system over the full time @xmath24 required for trajectories to settle numerically on the persistent attractive solutions .",
    "we shall find not just that there are only small differences between the results obtained with the method of fast numerical computation and those of the full time integration , but also that these differences are less than the width of the 95% confidence interval on the results as computed by monte carlo simulation .",
    "however , as we shall see , the choice of the time @xmath31 may be a delicate matter and need a few caveats .",
    "in order to study the basins of attraction of a dissipative dynamical system @xmath33 in @xmath34 , one takes initial conditions in a sample region of phase space , say @xmath35 , and lets them evolve in time . as a result of dissipation , the sample region @xmath36 will contract with time as trajectories move towards the persisting attractors .",
    "this leads to the following definition .",
    "[ def:1 ] given a dissipative dynamical system and a sample region @xmath36 , the region of phase space still occupied by trajectories starting in @xmath36 at time @xmath37 , after time @xmath38 has elapsed , will be called the _ contracted phase space _ at time @xmath38 and denoted by @xmath39 .    in principle",
    "@xmath36 is arbitrary , but in practice it is convenient to take it in such a way that ( a ) it contains the ( relevant ) attractors and ( b ) one has @xmath40 for @xmath38 large enough . thus , if the total time over which the system evolves consists of two intervals , a first interval @xmath22 $ ] in which @xmath41 varies and a second interval @xmath42 $ ] in which @xmath43 is constant , then whilst the first interval takes initial conditions from the whole of @xmath36 , the second one only receives initial conditions from @xmath44 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to know to which points in @xmath45 points in @xmath36 are mapped .",
    "this information is captured in the movement map , which is defined as follows .",
    "[ def:2 ] fix a set @xmath46 of points @xmath47 at time @xmath48 and let @xmath49 be the set of corresponding points @xmath50 that the trajectories with such initial conditions arrive at for @xmath51 .",
    "the continuous , bijective map @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 is called a _ movement map _ from time @xmath37 to time @xmath38 .",
    "the contracted phase space need not ( and in most cases will not ) be uniformly populated . to specify how  dense \" regions of the contracted phase space",
    "are we introduce the following definition .",
    "[ def:3 ] let @xmath54 be small enough . given a dissipative dynamical system and a sample region @xmath36 , let @xmath39 be the contracted phase space at time @xmath38 .",
    "consider a cover of @xmath39 with cubes of side @xmath55 and denote by @xmath56 the set of centres of the cubes .",
    "fix @xmath57 and for @xmath58 define @xmath59 as the fraction of trajectories starting in @xmath60 which evolve into the cube of side @xmath55 and centre @xmath61 at time @xmath38 .",
    "we define the _ density map _ from time @xmath37 to time @xmath38 as the map which associates the value @xmath59 with each @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 , the function @xmath59 is expected to become @xmath55-independent for @xmath55 small enough ; for this reason we have omitted its dependence on @xmath55 . on the other hand , if @xmath46 is a discrete set ( as in any numerical implementation ) , @xmath55 can not be too small for the definition to make sense .",
    "the definitions above are given explicitly in @xmath64 , but could be easily extended to @xmath65 , or even to higher dimensional systems . throughout the rest of the paper we focus on systems of the form , so that @xmath66 and the driving force is @xmath4-periodic in @xmath2 .",
    "moreover we consider damping coefficients @xmath9 which vary linearly between two values and become constant after a time @xmath16 . if @xmath67 is the set of initial conditions , we take @xmath68 such that @xmath69 . for the system ,",
    "a convenient choice for the sample region @xmath36 turns out to be @xmath70\\times[-4,4]$ ] . when considering a trajectory @xmath71 ,",
    "the points @xmath72 and @xmath73 are just different points on the same trajectory and share the same path as @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , since the forcing is @xmath4-periodic then the solutions with initial conditions @xmath77 and @xmath78 at time @xmath79 move towards the same attractor if we set @xmath17 from @xmath48 . this observation will be used when choosing @xmath31 to be a multiple of @xmath4 in the following  see section [ sec:3.1 ] .    a discrete approximation to the movement map will be represented by a @xmath80 matrix , in which the indices @xmath81 and @xmath82 correspond to the coordinates of the initial condition @xmath83 , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and in each @xmath86,@xmath87-th entry is a vector of the coordinates @xmath88 for the corresponding trajectory at time @xmath31 .",
    "colour coding the phase space we can represent the action of the movement map as shown in figure [ movementmapexample ] .",
    "a numerical representation of a density map can be achieved by averaging trajectories onto a grid , as done for the movement map .",
    "different colours may be used to express how dense regions of phase space are .",
    "in particular a density map allows us to see how the most dense regions of the contracted phase space move with variations in @xmath16  see figure [ densitymap ] .",
    "a movement map can be used to compute quickly the relative areas of basins of attraction for systems with @xmath9 varying over a time @xmath16 before reaching a final value @xmath21 , with only the need to integrate over a time @xmath68 , provided that the basins of attraction for constant damping coefficient @xmath43 are known .",
    "this can be achieved as follows .",
    "first , one covers the sample region @xmath36 with a mesh of points , with the requirement that the limiting solution of each point on the mesh is known for constant @xmath32 .",
    "of course , the basins of attraction for constant dissipation are obtained numerically , so that which attractor any point of the mesh converges to is known only approximately ; hence , high accuracy is required at this preliminary stage .",
    "in particular the equations of motion for initial conditions in the mesh have to be integrated over a time interval @xmath89 $ ] sufficiently large for the attractors to be approximately reached .",
    "next , a set of initial conditions is chosen and for each , the equations are integrated for @xmath90 $ ] . the point in phase space which the trajectory occupies at time @xmath31",
    "is then rounded to the nearest point on the mesh .",
    "provided @xmath31 is chosen to be a multiple of the forcing period , we know towards which attractor the rounded point moves asymptotically .",
    "repeating this for all initial conditions allows one to estimate the relative areas of the basins of attraction .    from the discussion above",
    ", it may seem natural to take @xmath91 to be the smallest multiple of the forcing period @xmath4 larger than @xmath19 , because then a trajectory which is inside a given basin of attraction at time @xmath31 will move towards the corresponding attractor .",
    "however , error is inevitably introduced when approximating the coordinates of the trajectories at time @xmath31 to the nearest point in the mesh . in systems where the basins of attraction are sparse the slight change of coordinate during the approximation may cause the results to be inaccurate . as a consequence it is found that in cases where @xmath16 is relatively small , or the basins of attraction are increasingly broken and sparse , @xmath31 must be taken larger than this . using a finer mesh reduces the error in the approximation and",
    "should cause the results obtained with the method of fast numerical computation described above to tend towards those when the system is fully integrated . in practice this is not always true , especially for systems with high sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "indeed , it is possible that with a coarse mesh the approximation to the point at time @xmath31 has the same attractor , while with a finer mesh the new , more accurate approximation moves to a different attractor .",
    "moreover there can be compensations which are destroyed by refining the mesh ; this is best explained by a simple example .",
    "imagine there are two initial conditions , one of which should tend to attractor @xmath92 and the other to attractor @xmath93 , but which , on the contrary , are predicted to tend to attractors @xmath93 and @xmath92 , respectively : in this case , the two errors cancel .",
    "suppose we then use a finer mesh and one of the two points is predicted correctly while the other prediction remains incorrect : now the errors do not cancel and the predictions of the relative areas of the basins of attraction will be in error .",
    "however , provided that this is a rare occurrence , increasing the number of points on the mesh will tend to increase the accuracy in general .    since basins of attraction are computed by taking a large but finite discrete set of initial conditions ( either on a mesh or uniformly and randomly distributed ) , an error is always produced by using the fraction of trajectories converging towards a given attractor to estimate the corresponding relative area .",
    "the following statistical result gives the confidence interval for results obtained by monte carlo simulation ; see @xcite .",
    "if @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the actual and estimated probability , respectively , of landing in a given basin of attraction , then we have @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the sample size ( the number of initial conditions used for the simulation ) ; the variable @xmath98 is the so - called @xmath99 value , which ensures a @xmath100 confidence interval @xcite .",
    "a confidence interval of @xmath101 results in the error values shown in table [ boaexpectedstaterr ] .",
    "for example if we take @xmath102 we can see that if an estimated basin of attraction covers 99.5% of the phase space , then we can state with 95% confidence that the actual basin of attraction will be @xmath103 .",
    "similarly , if the estimated basin covers 0.5% of the phase space , the actual basin of attraction will also be @xmath104 ; although the error is the same , the error relative to the basin size is much greater for small basins of attraction .",
    "thus when the basins of attraction are small , it is necessary to use more initial conditions .    in the forthcoming analysis",
    ", the error in the results obtained with the method of fast numerical computation relative to the fully integrated results will be deemed acceptable if it is less than the estimated 95% confidence interval for the relative areas of the basins of attraction .      in this section",
    "we investigate , in a concrete model , which types of basin of attraction are suitable for our method of fast numerical computation , how to reduce the error with respect to the full integration and how to increase the accuracy .",
    "we consider the pendulum with oscillating support , see , with @xmath9 varying linearly over a time @xmath16 from the initial value @xmath20 to the final value @xmath21 .",
    "of course , the reduction in computational time compared with the the full time span @xmath105 $ ] is a result of the smaller integration time @xmath31 . since @xmath23 , in systems where @xmath16 is large and comparable with @xmath24 this advantage is lost .",
    "however , it was seen in @xcite that most changes to the relative areas of the basins of attraction happen over a short initial time @xmath16 , where the method is particularly effective .",
    "the main numerical integration scheme used to test the method is matlab s ode113 , which is a variable order adams - bashforth - moulton scheme  simply because matlab offers ease in programming compared to using a low - level language such as c. although it is found that the integrator ode113 is not always reliable for this system , our aim is mainly to compare the method of fast numerical computation with the full time integration , rather than the accuracy of the full simulations relative to the true dynamics . for the same reason , throughout , the relative areas of the basins of attraction are given to 4 decimal places , despite the number of initial conditions for the full simulations producing uncertainty in the first or second decimal place  see table [ boaexpectedstaterr ] . as well as providing the results obtained for both fast and full simulations with the chosen method of integration",
    ", we also give the results obtained with two different , more efficient integration methods , a standard runge - kutta integrator and a scheme based on series expansion @xcite , both of which were implemented in c. the reason is to see whether the error produced by the method of fast numerical computation is within the difference produced by simply choosing a different numerical method and a different selection of initial conditions or of meshes to approximate solutions at time @xmath31 .    to test the method , we consider cases where the basins of attraction for constant values of @xmath43 become increasingly sparse",
    ". we study with @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 and @xmath109 ; the corresponding basins of attraction are shown in figure [ basinsconstantdamm](b ) and figure [ basinsconstantdamm](c ) , respectively . for @xmath110",
    "the system exhibits four persisting attractors , namely the fixed point @xmath111 , two rotating attractors ( one positively rotating and one negatively rotating ) and an oscillatory attractor ; we shall refer to them as fp , pr , nr and osc , respectively . for @xmath112 , only fp and osc persist .",
    "further details on these attractors can be found in @xcite .",
    "similar tests have also been conducted for @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , with the basins of attraction as in figure [ basinsconstantdamm](a ) . however , owing to the simple geometry of these basins of attraction , the results obtained were of little use for studying the restrictions of the numerical application .",
    "as such the results have not been included and hence we shall use the parameters @xmath106 , @xmath107 throughout the rest of this section .    in order to implement the method of fast numerical computation ,",
    "first a mesh of initial conditions must be set up and for each of these the equations must be integrated for constant damping @xmath21 .",
    "this is computationally expensive as the system is integrated over the full time span @xmath105 $ ] , required for solutions to move sufficiently close to the corresponding attractors that they can be identified . for constant @xmath11",
    ", this happens over times @xmath116 and values of @xmath117 between 10 and 100 times @xmath118 turn out to be sufficient ; for the chosen values of @xmath11 , this yields @xmath117 larger than @xmath119 . using the contracted phase space",
    " see figure [ phasespaceretractions8pi ]  for our smallest value of @xmath16 ( that is @xmath120 ) we can see that it is unnecessary to cover the entire region @xmath36 with a mesh of initial conditions , as roughly half of them will never be used . only covering the region",
    "@xmath121 would reduce both the computation time and memory required by a factor of roughly 2 ; see figure [ phasespaceretractions8pi ] .",
    "we first consider @xmath9 linearly evolving from @xmath109 to @xmath122 over a time @xmath123 , with @xmath124 , and fix the integration time at @xmath125 .",

    "the results in table [ dammerror1table ] show that the method performs well in this instance .",

    "as expected , the difference between the results obtained using different integrators reduces noticeably when increasing the number of initial conditions .",

    "when @xmath31 is larger , @xmath138 occupies regions of the basin of attraction which are deep inside the cores surrounding the attractors ; thus , they are distant from the boundaries and hence less sensitive to slight variations in initial conditions . in turn , the error created by the process of approximation onto the mesh is less significant . for the same reason , as the results in table [ dammerror3table ] corresponding to @xmath126 and @xmath140 show ,",

    "the corresponding basins of attraction are shown in figure [ basinsconst ] ; in figure [ basinsnotconst ] the basins of attraction for @xmath9 varying in time from @xmath145 to @xmath146 are represented for some values of @xmath16 .    in @xcite , for @xmath9 varying from @xmath143 to @xmath144 over a time @xmath19 , we noticed large transitions in the basins of attraction for @xmath147 , 100 , 500 ; see figure [ basinjumps](b ) . to understand why a jump appears ,",
    "say , for @xmath148 , we can reason as follows .",
    "we increase @xmath19 in steps of one from 92 to 99 . for all such values",
    "the appropriate density map shows that , after a time @xmath149 , over 90% of the trajectories are clustered in very small regions : this is an effect of the dissipation being rather large .",
    "indeed , all trajectories start tending to the attractors existing at @xmath150 . however , with the dissipation changing , also the attractors change quasi - statically . the attractors fp and do2 still persist at @xmath151 .",
    "most of the trajectories moving towards them form clusters at time @xmath31 close to the points at which the attractors cross the plane at @xmath152 ; we denote by fp and do2 such clusters , according to the attractor they are approaching . instead , the attractors pr and nr disappear when the damping coefficient reaches the value @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "the trajectories that were moving towards them form clusters that we denote by u. thus , at time @xmath31 , there are seven clusters of points : two clusters @xmath154 , one cluster fp and four clusters do2 ( since up to @xmath155 there are two period-2 solutions )  see figure [ denseregionsall ] .",
    "the cluster fp and each cluster do2 correspond roughly to 20% and 11 - 13% of initial conditions , respectively , while the two clusters u each represent roughly 12% of the initial conditions ( approximately the relative areas of the basins of attraction for the rotating solutions at @xmath150 ) .",
    "since both attractors fp and do2 remain stable for all values of @xmath156 $ ] , it is unlikely that the clusters labelled as fp and do2 will change their limiting solutions .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that the clusters fp and do2 are well inside the basins of attraction of the corresponding attractors fp and do2 , respectively , for all values of @xmath16 . on the contrary",
    "the clusters u move slightly from right to left in the upper half - plane and from left to right in the lower half - plane as @xmath16 increases . in doing so , they cross the boundaries of the basins of attraction for constant @xmath157 .",
    "we interpret the results above as follows .",
    "after some transient behaviour , the original sample phase space has contracted enough and been re - organised so that some regions of phase space become more dense than others ; in particular most of the trajectories end up inside some small , well separated clusters .",
    "the clusters u were converging towards the attractors pr / nr ; however , because of the different evolution of @xmath9 , they occupy slightly different positions at time @xmath31 as @xmath16 is varied .",
    "since they fall in a region where the basins of attraction for @xmath151 are sparse and formed of very thin bands , changing the value of @xmath16 may cause the clusters to cross the boundaries separating the bands belonging to different basins  see figure [ denseregionsall](b ) .",
    "this results in a large jump in the relative area of the basin of attraction of fp , as shown in figure [ basinjumps ] ; see also figure [ basinsnotconst ] . according to the results reported in figure [ basinsizes1 ] , the clusters u fall inside the basin of attraction of fp for @xmath158 and 99 , inside the basin of attraction of do2 for @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and inside the basin of attraction of do4 for @xmath164 .",
    ", @xmath114 and @xmath9 varying from @xmath165 to @xmath108 over a time @xmath16 .",
    "the circles represent results from numerical simulation , while the dashed lines are extrapolated on the basis of the observed periodicity  see the text for details.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we expect the jumps to occur for many other values of @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ basinsizes1 ] shows that jumps upward take place for fp , for instance , at @xmath166 , 79.2 , 85.8 , 92.4 , 99.0 and 105.6 .",
    "when a peak appears , it survives for a very narrow range of @xmath16 ( proportional to the width of the bands of the basins of attraction ) , after which a jump downward follows .",
    "for this reason , in practice it is difficult to predict exactly the values of @xmath16 where jumps occur , even though apparently they follow a periodic pattern  at least in the range of values we have investigated .",
    "indeed , every value of @xmath16 at which a jump appears is obtained by adding the same quantity @xmath167 to the previous one .",
    "for some values of @xmath16 the basin of attraction of the period-4 oscillation has grown , which implies that the basin of attraction of the new attractor do4 has formed exactly where the dense region u has arrived at that time .",
    "also in the case of do2 and do4 the jumps seem to have some periodicity in @xmath16 , however with a more intricate structure . it would be interesting to investigate further such a phenomenon .",
    "note that , if one applies the method of fast numerical computation described in section [ sec:3 ] to compute the relative areas of the basins of attraction in these cases , one needs to take a much larger value for the time @xmath31 at which the trajectories are approximated to the closest points of the mesh . more generally , this happens every time ( i ) an attractor disappears with increasing dissipation and ( ii ) the trajectories which were moving towards that attractor cluster into a small set in a region with tiny bands of the basins of attraction for @xmath32",
    ". then @xmath31 must be large enough for the clusters to have reached the core surrounding some persisting attractor . when @xmath16 is such that at time @xmath168 the clusters ( which have finite size ) touch or even spread across the boundaries of the bands , time @xmath31 must be very large for the method of fast numerical integration to work , in principle as large as @xmath24 itself . in this case",
    "the method may have no advantage over full time integration of the equations .",
    "the method of fast numerical computation can be used to estimate the basins of attraction in systems with damping coefficient @xmath9 varying linearly between two given values @xmath20 and @xmath21 over a time @xmath16 .",
    "first , one fixes a mesh of points in phase space and for each one computes which basin of attraction it belongs to when the damping coefficient is constant and equals @xmath21 , integrating the equation up to a long time @xmath24 .",
    "then one considers the system with varying dissipation : one integrates the equations over a time interval @xmath169 $ ] for a large set of initial data and then approximates each trajectory at time @xmath31 with the closest point of the mesh .",
    "if @xmath31 can be taken much smaller than @xmath117 , the computational time can be reduced significantly  up to a factor 20 in some cases we considered .",
    "the method works well for systems which have at least some regions surrounding the persisting attractors which are not sensitive to slight perturbations in initial conditions .",
    "it becomes more accurate as the integration time @xmath31 increases , a result of the phase space contracting into regions distant from the boundaries of the basins of attraction .",
    "thus the results can be improved by setting a minimum time @xmath170 , and taking @xmath171 .",
    "this seems to be necessary when @xmath16 is rather small or such that an attractor disappears in a region where the basins of attraction of the persistent attractors have a multi - band structure .",
    "using a finer mesh does not necessarily improve the results",
    ". however , smaller basins of attraction benefit from a finer mesh .",
    "indeed , they intersect only a few points of the mesh and hence , if a coarse mesh is used , inaccurate predictions are less likely to be cancelled .",
    "the accuracy could be improved further by using a mesh with non - uniform spacing and better fitting the mesh to the region @xmath138 to which the sample phase space has contracted at time @xmath31 .",
    "this was not implemented here , as it would add extra numerical complexities when rounding a trajectory at time @xmath31 to the nearest point on the mesh .",
    "both measures would reduce unnecessary full time integration of initial conditions on the mesh .",
    "further work could be carried out to remove the use of a mesh and instead have a set of random initial conditions .",
    "similarly the density of the random initial conditions in particular regions could be chosen so as to optimise the results .",
    "when the dissipation becomes large , at time @xmath31 the sample region has contracted into very small clusters .",
    "if this happens , either @xmath31 must be very large or a very fine mesh is needed for the method to produce accurate results . if @xmath31 is not large enough , the step of the mesh has to be at least comparable with the sizes of the clusters .",
    "for instance , to detect reliably the jumps that may occur in such a case , when an attractor is destroyed while the damping coefficient increases in time , a too rough approximation of the trajectories at time @xmath31 would produce a completely wrong description of the dynamics .",
    "finally , we note that , even though we have considered explicitly in this paper the case where dissipation varies linearly in time , both for simplicity and for comparison with the literature , we expect our results to extend to more general situations , where the damping depends on time and either becomes constant after a finite time or tends asymptotically to a constant value .",
