    "an important phase in the evolution of young stellar objects ( yso ) is the one during which they exhibit energetic mass outflows , and simultaneous accretion of material onto the star - forming core . since the discovery of bipolar outflows ( snell et al . 1980 )",
    ", much progress has been made in the study of the large scale and phenomenological characteristics of such outflows ( e.g. bachiller 1996 ) , but relatively fewer studies have probed the regions within @xmath0 100 au of the ysos , where the winds that drive the outflows , originate ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "1994 ) .    a significant fraction of all ysos exhibit water maser emission , and the maser luminosity appears to be correlated with the mechanical luminosity of the outflows ( felli et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the maser emission is thought to arise from dust - laden shocked gas close to the exciting ysos , where densities are @xmath0 10@xmath3 @xmath4 and temperatures are @xmath0400 k ( e.g. elitzur et al .",
    "1989 ) . since such conditions are likely to be highly localized , and since the velocity coherence required for building up large path lengths for the maser amplification is also likely to occur over relatively smaller regions , the water maser emission provides an excellent tool for probing the kinematics of the gas with high angular resolution ( @xmath01 mas ) .",
    "radio interferometric observations of the water maser emission and measurements of maser proper motions have been carried out mostly towards high - mass star forming regions such as orion - kl , w49n , w51 main , w51 north , sgr b2 and w3  ( oh ) ( genzel et al . 1981a ; gwinn et al . 1992 ; genzel et al .",

    "similar studies of low and intermediate - mass ( @xmath510 m@xmath6 ) star forming regions with very high spatial resolution are only now becoming available ( claussen et al . 1998 , furuya et al . 1999 , wootten et al . 1999 ) .",
    "iras 21391 + 5802 is an infrared source embedded in a bright - rimmed globule appearing on the northern periphery of the giant h ii region ic1396 .",
    "several observational studies of this object at various wavelengths suggest that it is an intermediate - mass star forming region ( sugitani et al .",

    "( 1995 ) using the nrao very large array ( vla ) at a resolution of 0@xmath11 resolution .",
    "these observations revealed a linear distribution of masers , with a systematic velocity gradient along its length .",
    "more recently , slysh et al . ( 1999 ) reported single - epoch observations of these masers with mas angular resolution .",
    "however , interpretation of the kinematics has remained ambiguous without proper motion data .",
    "we present here the results of a multi - epoch program of interferometric observations of the water maser emission from iras21391 + 5802 . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the observational details , followed by results and our interpretation using a simple model of a bipolar outflow .",
    "we observed the @xmath8 maser line at 22.23508 ghz , using the haystack 37 m telescope , the nrao 140-foot antenna at greenbank , wv , the vla in its largest and smallest configurations , and the nrao very large baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "the single - dish observations in 1994 - 1995 provided a time - series of spectra , while we determined absolute astrometric positions of the masers using the vla observations .",
    "the vlba observations were made for 6 hours on 1996 march 17 , 1996 april 20 and 1996 may 19 .",
    "we observed a single 4 mhz bandpass in left circular polarization , covering @xmath927 to + 27 km  s@xmath2 in velocity , and divided into 256 channels of 0.21 km  s@xmath2 each .",
    "the systemic velocity of the source , based on observations of @xmath10co j=1 - 0 emission , with a velocity resolution of 0.7 km  s@xmath2 , is about 0  km  s@xmath2 with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) ( patel et al .",
    "the data were correlated at the nrao array operation center at socorro , nm with an averaging time of 1.3 seconds , which provided a field - of - view of @xmath11 for the whole array .",
    "the data were reduced and imaged with standard techniques using the nrao aips package .",
    "observations of 3c345 , 1739 + 522 , 2007 + 777 , bl lac , and 3c454.3 provided delay and phase calibration .",
    "the sources 3c345 and bl lac were used for bandpass calibration .",
    "the synthesized beam in all three epochs was @xmath12 mas at a position angle of @xmath13 .",
    "the rms noise in the final images was @xmath0 6 mjy in all 3 epochs .",
    "initially , maps with reduced 1 @xmath14 1 mas resolution were made to identify the approximate locations of all the maser spots in a 1@xmath15 field .",
    "we define a maser `` spot '' as emission occurring in a given velocity channel .",
    "a maser `` feature '' is a collection of spots over contiguous channels .",
    "maps with the highest resolution were made for selected regions and two dimensional elliptical gaussians were fitted to each identified maser spot .",
    "the positions of the masers were measured with respect to the spot at @xmath914.6 km  s@xmath2 in maser feature a , which was used as a reference for self - calibration in all three epochs ( i.e. , for calibration of atmospheric path length fluctuations ) .",
    "the resulting position measurements have a mean formal uncertainty of @xmath16as . for each spot ,",
    "the adopted uncertainty is the larger of 1 ) the theoretical uncertainty from the beam - width and the signal - to - noise ratio , and 2 ) the measured uncertainty from the profile fit .",
    "contributions to the position uncertainties from the interferometric calibration ( e.g. , clock , astrometry , or baseline errors ) were negligible .",
    "for each epoch , maser spot positions and line - of - sight velocities were inspected graphically to identify distinct features .",
    "the number of identifiable maser features in the three epochs was 21 , 19 , and 20 , respectively .",
    "ten maser features persisted in all three epochs , with mean line - of - sight velocities changing by less than 0.5 km  s@xmath2 ( @xmath17 linewidth ) .",
    "proper motions were estimated by a least - squares fit to position as a function of time , with weights that were inversely proportional to the square of the uncertainties in position measurement .",
    "the weights were scaled to achieve unit reduced @xmath18 .",
    "a noise floor of 80 @xmath19as was added in quadrature to the uncertainties to account for possible unresolved structure within the maser spots .",
    "the noise floor corresponded approximately to the observed wander in the motion of the maser features about a straight - line trajectory .",
    "proper motions for features observed at only two epochs were discarded because their deviations from the straight - line motion could not be estimated .",
    "a time - series of spectra obtained during the time - monitoring observations of the water maser emission from iras 21391 + 5802 are shown in fig .",

    "the center velocities of some lines seem to change as well .",
    "however , data obtained over shorter time intervals ( @xmath21 2 weeks ; not shown here ) , do not show any significant changes .",
    "the velocity structure of the spectra are symmetric around the systemic velocity of @xmath22 km  s@xmath2 , but the vla images show that the 10 km  s@xmath2 emission is offset southeast by @xmath010@xmath23 ( 7500 au ) ( see also tofani et al .",
    "earlier interferometric observations of thermal continuum emission at 3 mm , and c@xmath24o j=1 - 0 line emission made by wilking et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , show an extension from the central peak towards this @xmath25 km  s@xmath2 maser feature .",
    "we suggest that this is a separate star forming condensation , unrelated to the rest of the masers in our map . wilking et al .",
    "( 1993 ) identified four near - infrared sources towards iras21391 + 5802 .",
    "irs2 ( wilking et al . 1993 ) which is associated with the 3 mm peak radio continuum emission , is closest to the water masers shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the observations by wilking et al . ( 1993 ) , there does not appear to be an infrared source associated with the @xmath25 km  s@xmath2 maser feature that is offset 10  from the bulk of the maser emission .",
    "2 shows the results of our vlba observations over the three epochs .",
    "the groups of maser features labeled a , c and d are isolated .",
    "these masers have line - of - sight velocities differing by more than @xmath26 km  s@xmath2 from the systemic velocity . a and d are the most extremely blue and red - shifted masers , respectively , and they also appear at the extrema of the distribution of masers on the sky .",
    "most of the masers in b appear to be aligned along an eastwest line near @xmath27 .",
    "we refer to these hereafter as the  inner \" masers .",
    "the integrated intensity maps of the inner masers are shown in fig .",
    "3 . from an analysis of fringe rates",
    ", we estimate that the position of the reference emission is @xmath28 .",
    "our vla a array observations made on 6 july 1995 , add information on the variability of maser emission in this region .",
    "the maser features a and b appear roughly in the same positions and line - of - sight velocities as in the vlba observations .",
    "two different maser features appear in the vla a array observations .",
    "one at a position offset of @xmath29 with a line - of - sight velocity of -8 km s@xmath2 and the other at @xmath30 and velocity of 22 km s@xmath2 .",
    "maser features c and d do not appear in the vla map . because the position uncertainties are about @xmath31 in the vla map , registered with respect to the vlba map , the vla data are not useful in estimation of motions .",
    "the proper motions in clumps a , c and d are suggestive of largely radial outflow from a center of expansion in clump b. within clump b there is a roughly circular loop of masers at @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocities of these masers are the closest to the systematic velocity of the region , and the velocities in the plane of the sky are consistent with a radial outflow . from these results",
    "we propose that the loop signifies the radius of dust sublimation in a circumstellar shell of outward flowing stellar wind material .",
    "maser emission is beamed along the line - of - sight by the long gain paths tangent to the edge of the relatively dust - free inner cavity .    from each feature , we have subtracted the mean measured proper motion for the whole source , to reduce the effect of the proper motion of the reference feature . in principle , an arbitrary velocity vector may be added to the proper motions since they are obtained from positions to the feature at @xmath34 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "if we add a proper motion of 6.8 km  s@xmath2 at a position angle of 29@xmath35 to each maser feature , then the two proper motion vectors associated with the loop become radial and outward . however , with the addition of this largely northward motion , the proper motions of the three easternmost features in b deviate significantly from a radial outflow .",
    "although the assignment of zero net proper motion may be somewhat arbitrary , it is the most straight - forward way to compensate at least partly for the relatively large apparent motion of the reference maser feature .",
    "the positions and 3d space velocities in fig .",
    "2 clearly show that systematic motions dominate over turbulent motions in this system .",
    "the masers trace bulk gas kinematics within 0@xmath36 or 500 au of the possible yso . in principle , within such close proximity , both infall along an accreting circumstellar disk and an orthogonal bipolar outflow may be anticipated ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "relying on interpretation of spectra and a single epoch vlba observation of these masers , slysh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) conclude that the maser kinematics might represent keplerian rotation of a circumstellar disk around a yso . however , in such a scenario the masers with line - of - sight velocity nearest the systemic velocity should show the largest proper motions .",
    "our data clearly rule out a disk model and support a bipolar outflow model .",
    "the loop of masers that we propose pinpoints the possible yso ( figs .",
    "2 & 3 ) has a radius of @xmath01 au .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of iras 21391 + 5802 is 235 l@xmath6 , implying a mass of 3 to 5 m@xmath6 .",
    "gravitationally bound gas within a radius of a few au of a 3 m@xmath6 object should exhibit orbital velocities of a few tens of km  s@xmath2 .",
    "however , all the features in the loop have line - of - sight velocities that are an order of magnitude less .",
    "furthermore , two of the features in the loop for which proper motions could be determined show 3d space velocities of only @xmath05 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "if the masers lie at about the radius where substantial condensation of dust grain occurs , then this is also the radius at which acceleration of the outflow by radiation pressure begins ; the low 3d space velocities are reasonable and may be upper limits on bulk outflow speeds closer to the yso . since the earliest observations of the maser source ( felli et al .",
    "1992 , brand et al .",
    "1994 ) the maser emission at line - of - sight velocities corresponding to the loop masers has been persistent , in contrast to the higher velocity maser features , which apparently lie downstream in the outflow .",
    "the masers in the loop may thus represent a standing pattern in outward flowing material , wherein masers are born , track outflowing and cooling material , and fade , to be replaced by new masers at smaller radii .",
    "masers downstream are products of shocks and local heating possibly in collisions between the outflow and ambient media .    the spectral energy distribution of the infrared emission from iras 21391 + 5802 has been studied by correia et al .",
    "according to their model , the temperature of the gas at a distance of 1 au from the yso is predicted to be about 1800 k. this is in excess by at least a factor of two higher than the temperature expected from the occurrence of the water masers in the loop .",
    "however , the calculated temperature depends sensitively on grain properties such as size .",
    "if the grains are larger than 1@xmath19 m in size , the dust envelope would be optically thin very close to the star , and lower temperatures would be possible ( @xmath01000 k ) .",
    "the 3d space velocities of masers a , c and d shown in fig .",
    "2 indicate an outflow away from the inner masers ( b ) . to estimate the position and inclination angles of the outflow , we fit a simple model to the data in which we assume an outflow velocity that is linearly proportional to the distance from the outflow center , with a proportionality constant , @xmath37 .",
    "we choose a coordinate system with its origin at the center of the loop .",
    "the purpose of this model is only to estimate the position and inclination angles and the value of @xmath37 . a straight line fitted to the observed maser positions alone provides the position angle @xmath38 . from the positions and 3d velocities",
    ", we obtain an inclination angle @xmath39 with respect to the line of sight , @xmath37 , and @xmath40 , the distance of each maser spot along the line of sight , and @xmath41 ( 0.07 km  s@xmath2 au@xmath2 ) .",
    "the inclination and position angle are difficult to measure well because the outflow appears to have an opening angle of at least 40@xmath35 , judging from the motions and line - of - sight velocities of c & d , and from the distribution of maser spots in b.    the fitted value of @xmath37 implies an overall e - folding time of @xmath065 yrs . the dynamical times obtained from the de - projected radii of the masers and the 3d space velocities are 43 , 38 and 14 yrs for the masers a , d and c. the inner masers ( b ) have a dynamical time of only 2 to 9 yrs .",
    "these different dynamical times are inconsistent with the masers being ejected ballistically at the same time but with different initial velocities .",
    "instead , there is possibly true acceleration in the flow as a function of distance away from the yso .",
    "another possibility is that the flow is ballistic but episodic .",
    "however , as noted earlier , maser emission at velocities close to the systemic velocity ( corresponding to b & l ) seems to have persisted since the earliest observations in 1988 ( brand et al . 1994 ) .",
    "thus , the mass outflow represented by the clumps of gas that are masing today , may be a continuous process , rather than a consequence of a singular event of mass ejection .",
    "we have detected proper motion of 10 water maser features associated with the star - forming region iras 21391 + 5802 .",
    "the water masers trace a bipolar outflow from an intermediate mass young stellar object .",
    "we estimate position and inclination angles of @xmath42 for the outflow axis , though the opening angle may exceed 40@xmath35 .",
    "the maximum observed 3d space velocity of the masers is 42 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the observed 3d space velocities of the masers suggest the presence of acceleration within the outflow , but we can not rule out episodic ballistic ejection .",
    "near the center of the flow , there is a roughly circular loop of masers with a radius of @xmath01 au .",
    "the masers in this loop are most likely to be tangentially amplified within a shell of dense gas surrounding the yso . because there is no evidence for rotation in the source ( as in a disk ) , the shell probably comprises wind material alone .",
    "however , dynamics of the iras 21391 + 5802 region are poorly sampled , especially in the loop .",
    "additional observations may still reveal some rotation , or even infall .",
