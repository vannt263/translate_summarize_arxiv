    "we will denote them by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( mod @xmath10 ) .",
    "the geometric meaning of the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be explained in the next section . in order to simplify the exposition we define the following notation for the sets of indices of the contact structures @xmath6 :    for any @xmath13",
    "we define @xmath14    we can visualize @xmath15 ( and the contact structures indexed by its elements ) as a triangle with @xmath16 rows and @xmath17 at its upper vertex .",
    "for example for @xmath18 we have :    @xmath19    for any @xmath20 , the contact structures on the bottom row ( i.e. those with @xmath21 ) are obtained by legendrian surgery on all possible legendrian realizations of the link in figure [ topsurg.fig ] ( see figure [ legsurg.fig ] ) , and therefore are stein fillable .",
    "all other contact structures are strongly symplectically fillable , and the top one ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) is known not to be stein fillable by @xcite .",
    "no stein filling is known for @xmath23 when @xmath24 , therefore we conjecture the following :    the contact structures @xmath6 are not stein fillable if @xmath24 .",

    "any @xmath27 determines a sub - triangle @xmath29 with top vertex at @xmath30 defined as @xmath31 the contact invariant of @xmath6 is then a linear combination of the invariants of the contact structures parametrized by the pairs in the base of @xmath32 . in order to compute the coefficients we associate natural numbers to the elements of @xmath32 , starting by associating @xmath33 to the vertex @xmath30 , and going downward following the rule of the pascal triangle .",
    "then the numbers associated to the elements in the bottom row , taken with alternating signs , are the coefficients of the contact invariants of the corresponding contact structures in the sum in equation ( [ f : main ] ) .",
    "olga plamenevskaya proved in @xcite that the contact invariants of the contact structures parametrized by the elements in the bottom row of @xmath15 ( i.e. those with @xmath21 ) are linearly independent , so all @xmath6 have distinct contact invariants .",
    "thus we have the following corollary :    [ classification ] @xmath34 admits exactly @xmath5 distinct isotopy classes of tight contact structures with non zero and pairwise distinct ozsvth ",
    "szab contact invariants .    the same classification result could probably be derived also from wu s work on legendrian surgeries @xcite and from the computation of the contact invariants with twisted coefficients of contact manifolds with positive giroux s torsion in @xcite .",
