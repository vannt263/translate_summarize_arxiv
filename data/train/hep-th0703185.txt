    "perturbative quantum field theory is known for its tremendous successes , with its ability to obtain highly precise values in quantum electrodynamics , or the tests of the standard model involving radiative corrections to weak interactions .",
    "however , actual calculations become rapidly cumbersome and display a conjunction of analytical and combinatorial difficulties combined with the very fast growth of the number of relevant terms , which get compounded by the need to address the subtraction of the various subdivergencies . in the quest of organizing principles for taming the combinatorial problem ,",
    "a major progress has been the recognition of a hopf algebra structure in the renormalization of quantum field theories @xcite and subsequent developments @xcite-@xcite and the link relating the cohomology of the introduced hopf algebras with dyson - schwinger equations @xcite-@xcite ( see @xcite for a complete list of references ) .",
    "an application to the summation of a category of diagrams in a simple yukawa field theory or a @xmath0 theory in 6 dimension has been obtained by broadhurst and kreimer in  @xcite . in that work a very powerful method to compute higher order corrections to the anomalous dimension has been developed .",
    "basically , it is based on a differential equation derived from the dyson - schwinger equation for the self - energy .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to extend such results to the case of a supersymmetric model .",
    "we have considered a wess  zumino like model in which the non - renormalization of the vertex ensures that the order zero in a large @xmath1 expansion of the renormalization group functions can be obtained .",
    "we also expect that the known non - renormalization properties related to supersymmetry should allow to go beyond this initial category of diagrams in future works . along the way",
    ", we propose an alternative derivation of the propagator - coupling duality presented in  @xcite based on intuitive renormalization group arguments .",
    "we consider massless chiral superfields @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and their ( antichiral ) complex conjugates @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which satisfy the following constraints:@xmath7 the derivatives are defined as : @xmath8 in terms of the chiral coordinates @xmath9 defined as @xmath10    each chiral superfield represents a complex scalar ( @xmath11 ) , a weyl fermion ( @xmath12 ) and a complex auxiliary field ( @xmath13 ) as it can be seen from their expansion in the @xmath14 variables , @xmath15 dynamics is governed by the lagrangian density @xmath16 the cubic superfield interaction corresponds to a yukawa coupling between scalar and fermions and , after the elimination of the auxiliary fields , to a quartic coupling of the scalars .",
    "the lagrangian reads in terms of component fields : @xmath17 in our conventions ( the same as in @xcite ) , we have @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "we only consider corrections to the propagators of the fields associated to the superfield @xmath2 , as corrections to the propagation of the superfield @xmath3 get a factor @xmath20 and do not contribute in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "moreover supersymmetry ensures that there are no divergent vertex corrections so that what we are calculating represents effectively the order zero of the large @xmath1 development .",
    "the set of diagrams that we consider is the same as the one studied in  @xcite , except that now the diagrams have to be considered as superfield diagrams and therefore , each one will correspond to a sum of ordinary feynman diagrams .",
    "the number of such diagrams grows rapidly with the number of loops and for example a given 12 loop superdiagram corresponds to 18144 ordinary diagrams .",
    "the diagrams we are looking at correspond to the expansion of the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations graphically represented in figure 1 .    with our ( minkowski ) conventions ,",
    "free propagators read @xmath21        it will be convenient to write schwinger - dyson equations in euclidean space .",
    "then calling @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 the full propagators for fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 in ( euclidean ) momentum space , the corresponding self - energies are introduced as @xmath27 we consider a simple one - loop correction to the self - energy , where one of the propagators has a momentum - dependent renormalization @xmath28 . the simplest case is the one for the self - energy of the auxiliary field @xmath29 , since there are only contributions from a single diagram with scalar propagators : @xmath30 for the fermion @xmath31 , we have the two contributions shown in figure  1 , @xmath32 in the case of the scalar @xmath26 , the three different terms shown in figure  1 evaluate as : @xmath33 a consistent ansatz to solve these equations is to take @xmath34 indeed , with this ansatz , the two integrals in  ( [ sigmachi ] ) combine to give @xmath35 times the right hand side of  ( [ sigma ] ) . similarly ,",
    "the equation for @xmath36  ( [ sigmaa ] ) becomes @xmath37 times  ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath38 .    the integration in ( [ sigma ] ) can be done along the same lines as in  @xcite .",
    "the angular integration uses the fact that the angular average of @xmath39 is @xmath40 . with the variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the radiative correction becomes @xmath43\\ ] ] taking the @xmath44 derivative to get rid of the infinite constant , we arrive first at @xmath45 a further derivation allows to obtain a simple differential equation for @xmath46 , @xmath47 with @xmath48 , which is equivalent to @xmath49 .",
    "the equation  ( [ resume ] ) is very similar to the one obtained for the yukawa case in  @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that the operator @xmath50 replaces in the present case the @xmath51 one in  @xcite .",
    "the two equations can then be identified by rescaling the variable @xmath52 and @xmath53 by appropriate factors .",
    "the results derived in  @xcite can then be reobtained taking into account the correct factors .    the most direct way of obtaining a solution of eq .",
    "( [ resume ] ) is to solve for @xmath54 order by order in @xmath53 , using the renormalization constraint @xmath55 . at order @xmath56 in @xmath53",
    ", @xmath54 is a polynomial in @xmath57 of order @xmath56 without constant terms .",
    "the renormalization group @xmath58 function is then the first derivative in @xmath57 for @xmath59 . @xmath60 here @xmath58 is the anomalous dimension for all the fields in the scalar multiplet @xmath2 .",
    "as was shown already in  @xcite , this procedure can be further simplified if one directly computes @xmath58 through the use of a non - linear equation that can be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ resume ] ) . indeed , consider the renormalization group relation  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) with respect to @xmath37 one obtains @xmath63 or @xmath64 this last identity was obtained as a consequence of the non - renormalization of the vertex which implies a connection between the @xmath65 and @xmath58 functions of the renormalization group .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) , which was derived here using the renormalization group , can also be derived using hopf algebra arguments as explained in  @xcite . indeed , in this last work the dependence of the self ",
    "energy on the momentum and the anomalous dimension ( the propagator  coupling duality ) based on the hopf structure of feynman diagrams is used to prove eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) . here",
    ", our derivation relies instead on the renormalization group relation eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "let us now rewrite eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) in the form @xmath66 and apply the operator @xmath67 to both sides . after some work one ends with @xmath68 from this nonlinear differential equation one can derive the perturbative expansion of @xmath58 , @xmath69    a simple mathematica program allows to evaluate @xmath70 for large values of @xmath56 according to this recurrence relation . as an example , @xmath71 can be evaluated quasi immediately giving @xmath72    we can then compute @xmath58 as a function of @xmath53 using eq .",
    "( [ recu ] ) .",
    "however being @xmath73 for large @xmath56 , the series is asymptotic and therefore we use a pad  borel resummation method .",
    "we start from the approximation @xmath74 where @xmath75 is defined by the following series @xmath76 numerical values for @xmath58 can then be obtained using a pad @xmath77 $ ] approximant for @xmath75 . if one avoids the values of @xmath77 $ ] for which this approximant has poles on the positive real axis , one can obtain stable evaluations for growing values of @xmath53 .",
    "the successive approximations are fully coherent and higher degree approximants allow to reach higher values of the coupling constant @xmath78 , @xmath79 . in a few seconds",
    "one can compute the anomalous dimension @xmath58 for values @xmath80 with a relative accuracy of the order of @xmath81 . as an example , one finds @xmath82 with a @xmath83 $ ] approximant .",
    "rational solutions are not possible for such high orders and the precision afforded by floating point numbers is not sufficient to obtain solutions , but the use of higher precision allowed to reach easily this stage .    in figure  2 , we show @xmath58 as a function of @xmath84 . remarkably , we see from the numerical results that the anomalous dimension @xmath58 of the scalar field can reach values where it exceeds the canonical one , so that , unexpectedly the propagator grows with the impulsion .",
    "one confirms this analytically from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath58 for large @xmath78 that can be easily inferred from eq .",
    "( [ nonlinear ] ) , @xmath85    we see that our calculation gives a complete knowledge of the renormalization group functions since , due to the non - renormalization of the vertex one has @xmath86 . in particular , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) allows to prove that the coupling constant goes to infinity for a finite value of the scale .",
    "we end this section by noting that the renormalization group played a central rle in obtaining the basic equations ( [ rela])-([nonlinear ] ) from the dyson  schwinger equations .",
    "general information on the renormalization group have been presented in  @xcite , deduced from the hopf algebra structure of perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "it would be of interest to combine the two approaches to fully realize the potential of dyson  schwinger methods to obtain renormalization group functions .",
    ", width=491 ]",
    "in this letter we have generalized the calculations of  @xcite to a supersymmetric setting .",
    "we have chosen to study a wess  zumino like model in which the vertex is not renormalized and this allowed us to calculate the order zero of the renormalization group functions in a large @xmath1 expansion in a closed form .",
    "writing the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations for propagators and proposing an appropriate ansatz for the corresponding self - energies we have found a non - linear differential equation for the anomalous dimension ( eq .  ( [ nonlinear ] ) ) from which one can derive a perturbative expansion for @xmath58 .",
    "coefficients in such expansion can be very easily evaluated up to very large orders and a pad  borel resummation allowed us to compute @xmath87 in a large range of coupling constants with great accuracy .    in our calculations ,",
    "the power of the hopf algebra approach has not be used explicitly .",
    "it is tempting to speculate , however , that the special features of perturbation theory in supersymmetric models should reflect in some particular structure within the hopf algebra approach .",
