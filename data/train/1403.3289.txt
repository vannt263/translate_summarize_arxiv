    "any renormalizable field theory will recieve quantum corrections to the potential .",
    "one can think of the e. weinberg and coleman perturbative quantum corrections to the classical scalar potential of any field theory as a simple example of these type of corrections @xcite .",
    "we phenomenologically characterize these corrections to the @xmath0 theory by introducing a real parameter @xmath2 as follows : @xmath3 with @xmath4 a given energy scale .",
    "of course , model by model , one can compute the specific potential as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we will show that it is possible to provide useful information on a large class of models corresponding to different values of @xmath2 using this simple approach . for completeness",
    "we analyze the cases in which @xmath5 couples both minimally and non - minimally to gravity .",
    "we find that for the non - minimally coupled case , the recent results by bicep2 indicating the presence of primordial tensor modes @xcite constrains @xmath2 to lie in the region @xmath6 , at the two - sigma confidence level .",
    "however , independently on the validity of the bicep2 results @xcite , it is fundamental to know whether quantum corrected potentials can account for nonzero tensor modes .",
    "interestingly , we also discover that for large primordial tensor modes the results are largely independent on the number of e - foldings .",
    "relevant examples of non - minimally coupled models are the higgs - inflation model @xcite and the ones in which the inflaton is a composite state @xcite .",

    "however , @xmath10 in the present case and we can safely identify @xmath11 with @xmath12 .    it is rather cumbersome to analyze inflation using this action .",
    "instead we proceed by applying a conformal transformation , which eliminates the non - minimal coupling term :    @xmath13    we then land in the einstein frame , in which the gravity sector is of the einstein hilbert form ( tildes are omitted to ease notation ) :    @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the transformation leads to an involved kinetic term and it is convenient to replace @xmath5 by a canonically normalized field @xmath15 using a field redefinition :    @xmath16    the einstein frame action then describes a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity :    @xmath17 , \\quad u(\\chi ) \\equiv \\left ( \\omega^{-4}v_{eff } \\right ) \\left ( \\phi \\left ( \\chi \\right ) \\right ) .",

    "large field asymptotic flatness of this term is what makes higgs - inflation viable @xcite .",
    "however , quantum corrections which we parametrize by @xmath2 , may spoil this feature of the potential .",
    "the analysis of inflation in the einstein frame is straightforward .",
    "we proceed by the standard slow - roll approach and compute the slow - roll parameters in the large field limit using the field @xmath15 and its potential @xmath22 .",
    "these may be expressed in terms of the jordan frame field @xmath5 by reinserting :    @xmath23    @xmath24    so far @xmath2 can assume any value and the only approximation made is the one in .",
    "inflation ends when the slow - roll approximation is violated , in the present case this occurs for @xmath25 .",
    "thus the field value at the end of inflation is : @xmath26 from the first identity we derive the universal bound : @xmath27 assuming the quantum corrections to be perturbative , in the underlying inflaton theory , we can expand for small values of @xmath2 and obtain the right - hand side of .",
    "we set @xmath28 since @xmath29 is required to generate the proper amplitude of density perturbations .",

    "it is evident that the @xmath2-correction push inflation to higher field values .",
    "an expansion is , however , justified for tiny values of @xmath2 .",

    "the kinetic term for the fluctuations then takes the form @xmath39 the first term of the series , i.e. the kinetic term for a free field , may be canonically normalized by a field redefinition @xmath40 the kinetic term then takes the form @xmath41 expanding the potential , the leading higher order operators take on the same form @xmath42 from these expression , we determine the cutoff of the theory which controls the physical suppression of higher order operators : @xmath43 this implies that the theory is valid , from the unitarity point of view , till the planck scale .",
    "we are now equipped to confront the inflationary potential with experiments .",
