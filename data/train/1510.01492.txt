    "nowadays various estimates of lyapunov dimension of attractors of generalized lorenz systems @xmath0 are actively developed @xcite .",
    "one particular case of system is the yang system @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 are positive , @xmath3 is arbitrary real number . in @xcite an estimation of lyapunov dimension for the generalized lorenz system",
    "was obtained ( see also remarks in @xcite ) , which for the case @xmath4 ( i.e. for the yang system ) is as follows :    [ errortheorem ] @xcite let @xmath5 be an invariant compact set of the yang system .",

    "we extend the domain of parameters , where the above estimation is valid .",
    "consider an autonomous differential equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is smooth .",

    "here @xmath35 is the derivative of @xmath36 with respect to the vector field @xmath37 : @xmath38 the introduction of the matrix @xmath23 can be regarded as a change of the space metric .",

    "we can prove the following result for the yang system .",

    "exact value of the lyapunov dimension is obtained by the comparison of estimate and the lyapunov dimension at the zero equilibrium point .",
    "we consider classical chaotic parameters of the yang system : @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in the first case inequality",

    "both systems were independently considered in 2008 year . but a particular case of the t - system was considered in 2004 @xcite .",
    "the t - system has classical chaotic parameters @xmath71 .",
    "conditions of theorem  [ main ] are valid in the case @xmath72 and takes the form :    \\(1 ) parameter @xmath73 ,    \\(2 ) inequality is transformed to @xmath74 and , thus , is valid ,    \\(3 ) the roots of the corresponding equation are @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and , thus , the greater root is positive .    therefore , if @xmath55 is a bounded invariant set of system with the parameters @xmath77 , then @xmath78",
    "the yang system by the transformation @xmath79 takes the form @xmath80 for @xmath81 the yang system becomes linear and its dynamics has minor interest .",
