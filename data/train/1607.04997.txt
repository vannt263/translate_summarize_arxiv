    "the nuclear inclination of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is a fundamental parameter that still remains tricky to directly measure . in radio - quiet objects ,",
    "proxies for measuring the orientation of agn usually rely on degenerate models and fitting procedures that sometimes give inconsistent results @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of radio - loud agn , in which there is beamed emission from pc - scale jets and unbeamed emission from diffuse radio lobes , we have an attractive method since the ratio of the former to the latter ( the radio core dominance r ) should be statistically a function of inclination with respect to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "operationally , it works well because on arcsec - scale maps , double radio sources generally show an unresolved and fairly isolated point source , usually with a flat synchrotron spectrum implying extreme compactness ( pc scales ) .",
    "furthermore selection by the nearly - isotropic lobe emission assures that a sample has a random orientation distribution , filling all solid angles as seen from the nucleus .",
    "this core dominance parameter is usually estimated in the radio because , in a general way , the jet and lobe radiation are linked physically . but ( for quasars only ) , the continuum optical flux density @xcite has also been used to normalize the beamed radio core flux density , instead of the flux density of the extended radio lobes . this core dominance parameter is called r@xmath3 . its usefulness has been confirmed by @xcite .",
    "narrow line luminosities have also been tried @xcite .",
    "very little is known about the reliability and precision of r as a statistical indicator of inclination .",
    "one way to test this is to see to what extent it separates radio galaxies ( rg ) from quasars , since we know that among the high-@xmath4 3cr radio galaxies , all rg host hidden quasars , and that they generally have smaller inclinations .",
    "we do nt know a priori whether or not a lot of noise will be added by a distribution of torus half - opening angles , `` holes '' in the torus , or dispersion in the radio core emission polar diagrams .",
    "but if core dominance correlates very well with object type , then the most natural conclusion is that the sources are roughly generic in nature , core dominance indicates inclination well , and there are very few quasars at high - inclinations .",
    "this is in fact what we will show .",
    "the unified model in its simplest form , the `` straw person model '' of @xcite , seems to be correct to first order in this parameter space , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "that is , the model shows very strong predictive power .",
    "the same conclusion follows from a detailed study of the x - ray properties of the sample by @xcite .",
    "high core dominance is known to be associated with low inclination and a flat ir sed ; it s also known that radio galaxies have lower core dominance than quasars ; we will show that limited optical polarization is also consistent with this idea when available .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to note and exploit the fact that there is essentially zero overlap in r@xmath5 between rgs and quasars , using that fact and the special sample properties to derive a quantitative formula for converting core dominance to inclination , estimating that it is good to plus or minus 10 degrees .    to obtain intelligible results ,",
    "it is fundamental to select a sample were all rg have hidden quasars , and to select by an approximately isotropic luminosity ( the radio lobes luminosity here ) .",
    "the high redshift ( i.e. @xmath0  1 ) radio - loud agn from the complete flux - limited , 178  mhz selected , `` 3crr '' catalog of @xcite meet this requirement very well . we know this for several reasons .",
    "first , most these objects have been observed polarimetrically and all show substantial optical polarization , oriented roughly perpendicular to the radio axes @xcite .",
    "they also show broad emission lines in polarized flux when that information is available . also , all of these radio galaxies for which data is available show strong mid - infrared reprocessing bumps @xcite and high ionization emission lines @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this sample comprises many of the most radio - luminous objects in the universe , and at lower radio luminosities many radio galaxies lack energetically significant hidden quasars @xcite ; the evidence for that statement from all wavebands is reviewed in detail in @xcite .",
    "in the following subsections , we compare radio r to the quasar / rg optical classification and also to infrared colors and optical polarization . doing so , we aim to robustly constrain the reliability and precision of the radio core dominance parameter to build our own semi - empirical relation linking the nuclear inclination and r.    we extracted the 3crr object types and redshifts @xmath4 from the on - line catalog and references therein .",
    "the radio core dominance was estimated between the 178  mhz flux densities corrected to the flux scale used by @xcite and the flux density of the core at 5  ghz ( where it s better isolated ) on arcsecond scales .",
    "additional r@xmath5 are extracted from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "infrared photometry was obtained with the spitzer space telescope and reported by @xcite .",
    "the optical polarization data are summarized in @xcite .",
    "our final , 100% completeness sample is listed in tab .  [",
    "table : data ] .",
    "we plot the number distribution of the core dominance parameter for radio - galaxies and quasars in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] .",
    "the top histogram shows the distribution of radio - galaxies ( in red ) and the bottom figure quasars ( in green ) .",
    "the separation between the two radio - loud agn classes is almost perfect , with only a few objects possibly overlapping between 0.045 @xmath6 r@xmath5 @xmath6 0.079 : two quasars ( 3c  68.1 , 3c  318 ) and two radio - galaxies ( 3c  294 , 4c  13.66 ) .",
    "3c  68.1 is a quasar with a very low core dominance ( r@xmath5 = 0.079 ) .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that its spectral index is about 6 for the optical continuum , indicating heavy absorption .",
    "3c  68.1 is also highly polarized , with a continuum polarization as high as 10% in the blue band ( 1900   rest frame ) , see @xcite .",
    "this indicates that 3c  68.1 is a borderline object , and this is consistent with the core dominance being on the boundary between the two types .",
    "3c  318 has an intermediate spectral type , being classified as a galaxy by @xcite .",
    "broad h@xmath7 ( but not h@xmath8 ) is detected by @xcite .",
    "this quasar shows very strong far - infrared ( fir ) fluxes ( 148 @xmath9 24 mjy at 60  @xmath10 m ) such as reported by @xcite , with fir fluxes likely to be dominated by a non - thermal beamed component @xcite .",
    "recent observations using the herschel space observatory revealed that most of the infrared emission from 3c  318 originates from a pair of interacting galaxies , close in projection @xcite .",
    "finally , note that the one radio galaxy plotted with r@xmath5 @xmath11 0.1 is an upper limit .",
    "the overlap of quasars and radio - galaxies at 0.045 @xmath6 r@xmath5 @xmath6 0.079 is thus naturally explained by one misclassified source and one object whose infrared flux is polluted by a pair of interacting galaxies .",
    "accounting for these peculiarities , the resulting association between radio r and optical type is perfect , perhaps fortuitously so .",
    "we can draw two conclusions .",
    "first , the nature of these powerful radio - loud agn is quite generic , i.e. the half - opening angle of the circumnuclear dusty region must be quite similar between radio - galaxies and quasars .",
    "second , all radio - galaxies ( type-2 agn ) are seen at higher inclinations than the quasars ( type-1 agn ) ; there are no high - inclination quasars seen through `` holes '' in the torus .",
    "these conclusions are in perfect agreement with the unified model of agn such as postulated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "measurements from @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and other infrared observatories showed that quasars have strong near - infrared ( nir ) and mir continua , bright silicate features and an emission bump at 2 5  @xmath10 m ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is quite generic , with much lower dispersion in their fluxes and ir colour compared with radio galaxies sed @xcite .",
    "additionally , the 2 5  @xmath10 m radio galaxy extinctions derived by @xcite are higher than the ( wavelength - normalized ) values derived in the mir , indicating that the component responsible for the nir bump suffers more extinction than the mir emission .",
    "this is consistent with the torus geometry .",
    "hence , looking at the nir and mir fluxes it is possible to try to corroborate the association we found between r@xmath5 and optical type @xcite . by selecting our sample purely on unbeamed radio emission in the @xmath0  1 group , we are able to study the ir without biases . in the following ,",
    "the spitzer 3.6  @xmath10 m and 24  @xmath10 m observed - frame fluxes are taken from @xcite , also listed in @xcite , and from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "[ fig : ir_fluxes ] shows the radio core dominance parameter versus nir ( top ) and mir ( bottom ) fluxes .",
    "we see that the 3.6  @xmath10 m rg fluxes are , on average , a factor 6.3 lower than the quasar fluxes ( median : 6.8 ) , which is in good agreement with the quasar / radio - galaxy flux ratios ( 2.5  7.5 ) found by @xcite at 3.5  @xmath10 m .",
    "the same conclusions apply for the 24  @xmath10 m fluxes against r@xmath5 , where the mir emission is found to be more isotropic . due to the dispersion of data points ,",
    "the flux ratio is more complicated to estimate but the averaged value is 3.3 ( median : 3.4 ) .    the flux ratio between nir and mir emission is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ir_ratio ] .",
    "the radio - galaxies are below the quasars on average , by a factor @xmath2  1.35 .",
    "there is a fairly low dispersion among the quasars as their ir seds are generic ; in the case of radio - galaxies the distribution is less tight as rg show less uniformity than quasars @xcite . for a a given 24  @xmath10 m flux , the 3.6",
    "@xmath10 m flux is much lower for the radio galaxies , as expected from the obscuration paradigm .",
    "finally , it seems that we are also detecting an inclination - dependence of the nir / mir flux ratio within each class in the expected sense .",
    "our conclusions that the @xmath0 1 3crr radio galaxies have several times weaker nir and mir emission compared with the matched quasars , and more varied seds , are not new .",
    "they were stated explicitly by @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite shows quotient spectra for radio galaxies over quasars . for lower redshift 3cr objects , @xcite reported these effects , with references to much earlier work .",
    "the novel aspect here is again to exploit the near perfect separation of the classes by ir colors to constrain deviations from the simplest unified model .",
    "the infrared fluxes have shown excellent agreement with the expectation from the unified model and strongly corroborate our finding that there is an almost perfect separation between the two optical classes of radio - loud agn based on r@xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to do a third check using near - ultraviolet , optical and near - ir continuum polarization measurements from the literature .",
    "the unified model again makes strong predictions about the degree and orientation of agn polarization and we expect a clear dichotomy between type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "our sample is too small to demonstrate the predicted relationships by itself , but we can check for consistency .    tab .  [",
    "table : data ] lists the only 13 polarimetric data reported for the 3crr objects in our sample .",
    "these agn have been observed in u , b , v and/or r polarization filters , and were corrected for the small polarizations of the instrument and the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "the polarization degree @xmath15 and the difference @xmath16 between the radio position angle pa and the optical polarization position angle @xmath17 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarization ] top and bottom , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 seems similar between rg and quasars , but radio galaxies are generally substantially diluted by starlight , while that of quasars is not @xcite , which is part of the reason why the polarization degree of the two groups seems similar .",
    "however , there is a net difference between type-1 and type-2 agn : rg only show a polarization position angle approximately perpendicular to the projected axis of the radio structures ( @xmath16 = 90@xmath1 ) while quasars are characterized by a blend of perpendicular and parallel polarization angles",
    ". the exact same dichotomy appears in radio - quiet agn @xcite and radio - loud agn at lower redshifts @xcite , where type-2s have perpendicular @xmath17 only .",
    "the presence of perpendicular @xmath17 indicates that photons dominantly experience scattering in polar directions , while a parallel @xmath17 is the signature of equatorial scattering .",
    "polar scattering dominated quasars tend to have higher degrees of polarization ( up to a couple of percents ) than equatorial scattering quasars , as already observed for their radio - quiet analogues @xcite .",
    "a large part of the higher polarization in well - studied type-2 agn results from the fact that the direct light from the quasar is blocked ; otherwise it would dilute the observed polarization , often very strongly .",
    "however , the relatively high polarization of the polar - scattered quasars indicates that our inclination - dependent view of the scattering medium also plays a role .",
    "finally , we note that the incidence of high parallel polarization in the quasars is much higher than in other well - studied samples @xcite , although it s not clear why this should be the case .",
    "since we are very confident that core dominance is a good qualitative inclination indicator , and that the sources are distributed uniformly in solid angle ( copernican principle ) , we can make a quantitative semi - empirical function for the average inclination @xmath18 as a function of core dominance .",
    "it should be of interest to both observers and theorists @xcite .",
    "to do so , we equally distributed the sources in solid angle and numerically fitted the relation using a polynomial regression .",
    "we obtained the following semi - empirical relation between core dominance and agn inclination :    @xmath19    or , if numerically inverted(r@xmath5 ) becomes less reliable for extremes values of @xmath18 . ] :    @xmath20    with lr = @xmath21 .",
    "the first formula , essentially the polar diagram for core emission , should be more useful to theorists , while the second version is directly useful to observers wishing to estimate the inclination for a given system .",
    "[ tab : fit ]    the parameters `` a '' and `` g '' are constants that represent the equivalent emission of an isotropic component . values for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , are given in tab .  [",
    "tab : fit ] , together with the goodness measures of the fitting function to the distribution of the sources in solid angle .",
    "the typical uncertainty in @xmath18 can be no more than about @xmath9 10@xmath1 ; otherwise simulations show that the rg and quasars would overlap substantially .",
    "the number distribution resulting from this analytical formula is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ] ( top ) .",
    "our new function properly reproduces the observed increase of quasar number at large r@xmath5 and predicts that the distribution should be almost uniform in @xmath18 at large inclinations .",
    "note that our formula must not be used in highly core - dominant objects , since the distribution is not sampled well at small inclinations .",
    "although we do nt have many sources , we can estimate the averaged half - opening angle of the circumnuclear region by estimating the ratios of type-1 to type-2 objects in out complete sample , which is 0.574 , corresponding to a critical inclination of 55@xmath1 ( 60@xmath1 if excluding the two peculiar quasars mentioned in sect .",
    "[ main : histogram ] ) .",
    "this result agrees with the values found by previous authors , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and many others , who looked at high - luminosity radio - loud agn and estimated that the half - opening angle of the equatorial region is @xmath2 45@xmath1  60@xmath1 . in the future",
    "we may enlarge our sample , or explore other parameter space using the same methods .",
    "we plotted r@xmath5 as a function of @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ] ( bottom ) , together with the analytical formula from @xcite , where it is assumed that jets are co - linear ( zero opening angle ) and moving with a single bulk velocity , so that r@xmath5(@xmath18 ) is just determined by special relativity . when compared with this naive model , our semi - empirical formula shows much stronger than predicted core fluxes at intermediate angles , so that the polar diagram is not as sharply peaked at @xmath18 = 0 as in the toy model .",
    "taken at face value , the bulge in the polar emission diagram at @xmath34 40@xmath1 is consistent with the popular spine - and - sheath model @xcite , where there is a slow jacket to a fast very narrow jet .",
    "the slower sheet ( layer ) is only modestly beamed and substantial broadening of the effective beaming cone is required .",
    "this indicates a range of bulk speeds among objects or within individual jets , a range of direction of synchrotron - emitting plasma elements , optical depth effects , or other deviations from the single - zone jet @xcite .",
    "however , our sample is small and better statistics are needed to evaluate the statistical significance of the bulge and , more generally , of the r(i ) formula .",
    "we have demonstrated that the radio core dominance parameter r@xmath5 separates the radio - galaxies and quasars almost perfectly in the @xmath0  1 3crr sample . in other words , the agreement of r@xmath5 with optical type is not a coincidence , and probably both r@xmath5 and optical type are reliable orientation indicators .",
    "since the 3crr catalog is a complete sample , it must fill the solid angle uniformly , except for small number statistics , just from the copernican principle .",
    "therefore we were able to derive an empirical core dominance formula , where r@xmath5 is a function of inclination @xmath18 .",
    "the essentially perfect separation of the optical types by radio core dominance and infrared ( and x - ray columns ) is most simply interpreted as meaning that there is only a small dispersion of opening angle , and no holes in the circumnuclear region which would let us see a type-1 agn at high inclination ( contrary to the hypothesis of @xcite ) .    at lower luminosities ,",
    "such predictions are less clear as the sample gets less clean .",
    "it is possible to extend the catalog to lower redshifts but it would be necessary to exclude nonthermal rg .",
    "weakly - accreting radio - galaxies mostly radiate through kinetic energy in the form of synchrotron jets and lack highly ionized line emission and strong ir reprocessing bumps , which indicates that they lack energetically significant hidden quasars ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is then essential to remove them to have a correct sample .    at higher redshifts",
    "another problem may arise due to the fact that the ratio of lobe emission to jet power is sensitive to environment @xcite .",
    "the density of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) scales with redshift as ( 1 + @xmath4)@xmath35 @xcite . for a @xmath4 = 5 quasar ,",
    "the igm density is 27 times higher than compared to a @xmath4 = 1 quasar , and these should strongly affect the morphology , lobe flux ratios , and lobe distance .    the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for her / his useful and constructive comments on the manuscript .",
