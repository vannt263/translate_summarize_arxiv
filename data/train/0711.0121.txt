    "kondo insulator compounds constitute a sub - class of lanthanide / actinide based heavy fermion materials",
    ". characterised by small spectral and optical gaps , and an activated resistivity at low temperatures , they have been under intense theoretical and experimental investigation for many years ( for reviews see @xcite ) . from a theoretical perspective , the essential framework for understanding heavy fermion materials is the periodic anderson model ( pam ) , wherein a single correlated @xmath3-level in each unit cell of the lattice hybridizes locally with a non - interacting conduction band .",
    "theories for kondo insulators ( ki ) have generally been based on the particle - hole symmetric limit of the pam  @xcite , in which the @xmath3-level occupancy ( @xmath4 ) and the conduction band filling ( @xmath5 ) are each equal to unity .",
    "although @xmath6 indeed satisfies the condition for an insulating ground state , it is not the generic case , which by contrast is @xmath7 ( as shown and discussed in  @xcite ) .",
    "the strong coupling limit of the pam is of course the kondo lattice model with wholly localised @xmath3-electrons and hence @xmath8 necessarily , so one naturally expects that if a particular ki is sufficiently strongly correlated then the particle - hole symmetric pam should provide a sound description of it .",
    "and indeed theories baseed on the symmetric pam have been able to describe , even quantitatively , many aspects of a number of these materials ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ".    one can not however expect such theories to be complete , since the fact that the generic condition for kondo insulating behaviour is @xmath9  @xcite itself suggests that ki materials are likely as a rule to be mixed - valent ( @xmath10 ) ; as indeed seems to be the case experimentally  @xcite , and which behaviour lies beyond the scope of the symmetric pam .",
    "a more general treatment of kis to encompass mixed - valent behaviour is thus clearly desirable , based on the general asymmetric pam with the constraint @xmath11 .",
    "it is this we consider here .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite , working within the general framework of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , we developed a local moment approach ( lma ) ( see  @xcite for details ) to heavy fermion systems .",
    "this encompassed both strong coupling kondo lattice behaviour ( @xmath12 arbitrary ) , as well as the mixed - valence regime ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 arbitrary ) .",
    "the theory was subsequently compared to experiments on several heavy fermion metals , and excellent quantitative agreement was found  @xcite .",
    "although comparison was made only to metallic systems , the insulating ground state is just a particular solution of the same basic theory , that may be obtained by restricting the parameter set to the line @xmath7 . in the present paper",
    "we treat the generic case by supplementing the theory of  @xcite with a constraint on the total filling , @xmath7 , but allowing @xmath4 and @xmath5 to deviate from unity .",
    "this enables us to capture the mixed - valency along with the insulating nature of these systems .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the model and formalism used .",
    "theoretical results for spectra and transport are discussed in section 3 , followed by a detailed comparison with experiments on the filled skutterudite compound @xmath13 , and a brief conclusion in section 4 .",
    "in standard notation , the hamiltonian for the pam is given by :    = -t_(i , j ) , c^_i c^_j + _ c_i , c^_i c^_i +   + _ i , ( _ f + f^_i - f^_i- ) f^_if^_i +   + v_i , ( f^_i c^_i + ) [ eq : model ] the first pair of terms describe the non - interacting conduction ( @xmath14 ) band .",
    "the first gives the kinetic energy ( or ` free ' conduction band @xmath15 ) , with the nearest neighbour hopping @xmath16 scaled as @xmath17 in the large dimensional limit of coordination number @xmath18  @xcite , and @xmath19 taken throughout as the unit of energy ; while the second gives the @xmath14-orbital energy , such that varying @xmath20 simply shifts the centre of gravity of the free conduction band relative to the fermi level , and as such controls the conduction electron filling @xmath21 .",
    "the third term in @xmath22 represents the @xmath3-orbital energy ( @xmath23 ) and the on - site coulomb repulsion ( @xmath24 ) for the localised @xmath3-orbitals , and the final term denotes the local hybridization between the @xmath14 and @xmath3-electrons which is responsible for making the otherwise localized @xmath3-electrons itinerant .",
    "the free conduction band may be diagonalised , @xmath25 , with corresponding density of states @xmath26 .",
    "while the basic formalism is valid for any underlying lattice and associated @xmath27 , we consider in this paper the specific case of the hypercubic lattice ( which is bloch - decomposable , unlike e.g.  a bethe lattice ) , for which @xmath28 is a gaussian .",
    "+ within dmft , the @xmath3-electron self - energy @xmath29 , representing many - body scattering due to electron interactions , is rendered purely local ( i.e.  site - diagonal or momentum independent ) .",
    "the local , site - diagonal green functions for the conduction- ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath3-electrons ( @xmath31 ) are then given by  @xcite    g^c()&= & ^_-d    ^_-d   _ 0 ( )  g^c ( ; ) [ eq : gc ] + g^f()&= & [ eq : gf ] ( with @xmath32 ) .",
    "solution of these dmft equations naturally requires a knowledge  and self - consistent determination  of the @xmath3-electron self - energy @xmath29 , which dmft by itself does not of course prescribe . for this",
    ", we employ the physically transparent local moment approach ( lma )  @xcite .",
    "this handles non - perturbatively all interaction strengths from weak to strong coupling , and all relevant energy / temperature scales , while at the same time recovering the dictates of fermi liquid behaviour at low energy / temperature scales .",
    "originally introduced to describe anderson impurity models  @xcite , for which it is found to agree well with e.g.  numerical renormalization group calculations and a number of exact results , lattice - based heavy fermion systems have also been considered within dmft+lma  @xcite .",
    "here we sketch in brief only the essential elements of the lma :    ( i)the starting point is simple _",
    "static _ mean - field , i.e.  unrestricted hartree - fock .",
    "this has the virtue of recognising local moment formation as the first effect of electron interactions , by introducing the possibility of local moments from the outset .",
    "but by itself it is inadequate , for two reasons .",
    "first , it results in a ( locally doubly - degenerate ) symmetry broken mean - field state , which is not perturbatively connected ( in @xmath24 ) to the non - interacting limit and in consequence violates fermi liquid behaviour at low energies .",
    "second , its inherently static nature can not by construction capture electron correlation effects .",
    "it is these signal limitations the lma overcomes .",
    "\\(ii ) electron correlations , embodied in dynamical self - energies , are incorporated within the framework of a spin - rotationally invariant _ two - self - energy _ description which is an inevitable consequence of the underlying two mean - field saddle points ( and from which the conventional single self - energy @xmath33 is recovered simply as a byproduct ) .",
    "the resultant dynamical self - energies are built diagrammatically from , and are self - consistently determined functionals of , the underlying mean - field propagators .",
    "they include in particular a non - perturbative class of diagrams that capture the spin - flip dynamics central to the physics of the pam .",
    "( iii)the third , key element of the lma is that of _ symmetry restoration _",
    "@xcite : self - consistent restoration of the symmetry broken at pure mean - field level , and hence correct recovery of the low - energy local fermi liquid behaviour that reflects adiabatic continuity to the non - interacting limit .",
    "this is embodied in a single self - consistency condition on the two - self - energies precisely at the fermi level ( @xmath34 ) , which in practice amounts to a self - consistent determination of the local moment ( supplanting the simple ` gap equation ' for such that arises at crude mean - field level ) .",
    "\\(iv ) luttinger s theorem  @xcite , itself a reflection of perturbative continuity to the non - interacting limit ( i.e.@xmath35 ) , is also satisfied by the lma  @xcite .",
    "we note too that adiabatic continuity to the non - interacting limit is characteristic of _ both _ the heavy fermion ( metallic ) and kondo insulating states  @xcite .",
    "full details regarding the structure and implementation of the local moment approach for the generic asymmetric pam are given in  @xcite , to which the reader is referred for further information .",
    "+ since our objective is to study generic kondo insulators , corresponding to @xmath36 ( for @xmath37 where the distinction between an insulator and a metal has strict meaning ) , we now examine the general conditions under which an insulating ground state is obtained . to this end",
    "we note that the luttinger theorem @xmath38 can be expressed as the following exact statement for the fermi surface of the pam , as shown in  @xcite : ( n_c+n_f ) = ^-_c + 1/_f^*_- _ 0 ( ) d + ( -_f^ * ) [ eq : lutt ] ( with @xmath39 the unit step function ) .",
    "here @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the renormalised or effective @xmath3-level given by @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 ) .",
    "from this it follows that , for any conduction band @xmath44 , the ki filling constraint @xmath45 is satisfied if @xmath46 ( whether @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) .",
    "moreover for a non - compact bare density of states @xmath44 , such as the gaussian appropriate to the hypercubic lattice we consider , @xmath49 is the only possibility that satisfies @xmath36 . as such , @xmath46 is the general condition for a ki that we seek ; with the ( particle - hole ) symmetric ki ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) simply the particular case for which @xmath52 .",
    "the condition @xmath46 also leads naturally to a gap at the fermi level ( @xmath34 ) in the @xmath37 single - particle spectra @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this is most easily seen from the limiting low - frequency behaviour of equations ( [ eq : gc ] ) and ( [ eq : gf ] ) for @xmath37 , obtained from a low-@xmath55 quasiparticle expansion  @xcite and given by d^c()~_0(-_c- ) [ ad1 ] + v^2d^f()~_0(-_c- ) [ ad2 ] where @xmath56 . here , @xmath57 is the characteristic low - energy fermi liquid scale in the problem ( with @xmath58^{-1}$ ] the usual quasiparticle weight , or inverse mass renormalization factor ) . from this",
    "it is readily seen that with @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( and likewise for the @xmath3-spectrum ) , as one expects for an insulator .    in this paper",
    "we implement the filling condition @xmath61 simply by supplementing the lma with the @xmath37 constraint @xmath62 ( which is algorithmically simple ) , ensuring thereby direct access to the generic kondo insulating states of interest .",
    "the lma yields directly the local green functions ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) and self - energies , knowledge of which is well known to be sufficient within dmft  @xcite to determine d.c .",
    "transport and optical properties , as detailed e.g.  in  @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we discuss our theoretical results .",
    "the pam , equation  [ eq : model ] , is characterised by four ` bare ' material parameters , @xmath65 and the @xmath3-level asymmetry @xmath66 ( or equivalently @xmath23 itself ) .",
    "the local spectra naturally depend on these parameters , and the ( @xmath37 ) total filling is given by n_c+n_f  =  2 ^ 0_-d[d^c(;u , v,_c , ) + d^f(;u , v,_c , ) ] .",
    "[ eq : fconst ] for a metallic phase , @xmath67 are in general independent parameters .",
    "but for the kondo insulating state , the constraint @xmath36 obviously implies that only 3 of the bare parameters are independent , e.g.  @xmath68 .",
    "we illustrate this is figure  [ fig : uv2 ] , showing the resultant @xmath69 _ vs _ @xmath70 ( with @xmath71 and hence @xmath72 ) , for a fixed value of the hybridization @xmath73 and three different interactions @xmath24 .",
    "all curves meet at the origin , this being the symmetric ki ( @xmath74 ) for which @xmath75 for _ all _ @xmath24 and @xmath73 , i.e.  @xmath76 is independent of @xmath24 and @xmath73 . away from @xmath51",
    "however , @xmath69 depends generically on all of @xmath77 and @xmath20 . on increasing @xmath70 for any",
    "given @xmath24 and @xmath73 , as in figure  [ fig : uv2 ] , the system becomes progressively mixed - valent : @xmath69 increases ( i.e.  the @xmath3-level moves upwards towards the fermi level ) , and @xmath78 steadily diminishes from @xmath79 at @xmath80 , with a concomitant increase in the resultant quasiparticle weight / inverse mass renormalization @xmath81 ( and hence in the low - energy scale @xmath82 ) .",
    "in fact over the @xmath24-range shown in figure  [ fig : uv2 ] , the resultant @xmath78s for given @xmath20 barely change with @xmath24 , @xmath78 dropping to @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",

    "the associated @xmath78 differs only slightly with @xmath73 over the range shown , with @xmath97 indicating mixed - valent character .",
    "the single - particle spectra for this representative asymmetric ki are indeed seen to be gapped at the fermi level , with magnitude @xmath98 , and",
    "the obvious key point is that the gap is asymmetric about the fermi level ( it is of course strictly soft for a hypercubic lattice , but with exponentially small spectral density in the vicinity of the fermi level ) .",
    "the four sets of spectra are seen to be quite distinct away from the fermi level , as one expects . however the limiting low - frequency spectral forms are given ( asymptotically exactly ) by equations  ( [ ad1 ] ,  [ ad2 ] ) which , with @xmath46 as appropriate to the ki , are seen to depend solely on @xmath20 and @xmath99 ; i.e.  they should be independent of @xmath73 or @xmath24 ( which we note has nothing _ per se _ to do with the ` universal scaling ' of spectra characteristic of the strong coupling limit @xmath100  @xcite ) . that the lma correctly recovers this behaviour correctly is self - evident from the figure .",

    "@xcite we have also found such behaviour to be characteristic of correlated intermediate valence metals .",
    "we conclude therefore that a low - frequency shoulder should typically exist , as an _ intrinsic _ optical feature , in interacting mixed - valent systems whether metallic or insulating ; and that it arises from a combination of many - body scattering and mixed - valency .",

    "we make comparison of the theory outlined in this paper to experimental measurements of d.c .  and optical transport in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "we consider first the d.c .  transport . in this compound",
    "the phonon contribution to the d.c .",
    "resistivity is quite significant , so for comparison to theory we need to extract the magnetic contribution , @xmath170 , from the d.c",
    ".  resistivity measured directly .",
    "this is achieved by subtracting the phonon contribution  itself estimated conventionally as the resistivity of @xmath171  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a detailed discussion )  from the experimentally measured d.c .",
    "resistivity  @xcite ; and is shown as circles in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "another experimental group has also reported @xmath170 itself  @xcite ; and although their absolute magnitudes are quite different from those of  @xcite , a simple y - axis rescaling is sufficient to collapse the two sets of data , as indicated by squares and circles in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ( and indicating simply distinct sample geometries in the two cases ) .",
    "the low temperature ( @xmath172 ) resistivity can be fitted to a @xmath173 $ ] form , suggesting the dominant mechanism of transport in this temperature range to be efros - shklovskii type variable range hopping  @xcite ( which extrinsic behaviour is not of course included in the present theory ) . a shallow maximum",
    "is seen in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] at @xmath174 , beyond which @xmath170 decays monotonically . a rough estimate of the low energy scale ( @xmath175 ) in this system may be obtained through an estimation of the ( indirect ) gap in the experimental optical conductivity  @xcite , shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "this yields @xmath176 , which thus gives the low energy scale @xmath177 ( see also the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] and  @xcite ) .",
    "an idea of the parameter regime this system belongs to can be gleaned from two qualitative features evident in the @xmath178-dependence of the experimental @xmath179  @xcite shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "first , the highest temperature at which @xmath179 is measured is @xmath180 which is @xmath181 , while the optical conductivity at the same temperature is affected up to @xmath182 .",
    "the fact that the thermally induced spectral weight redistribution is over a range of frequencies much higher than the temperature at which @xmath179 is measured is characteristic of relatively weak correlations  @xcite .",
    "second , a closer look at the low - frequency structure of @xmath183 reveals an additional absorption feature at @xmath184 , which in the context of the theoretical results obtained above ( see e.g.  figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) , is suggestive of mixed - valence character .    with this in mind , we choose an @xmath185 , and for various @xmath186 calculate @xmath187 .",
    "we find that the d.c .",
    "resistivity ( @xmath34 ) and the optical conductivity determined at @xmath188 match best with the experiment , with @xmath189 . with these parameter values the @xmath3-level asymmetry @xmath69",
    "is found to be @xmath190 , implying @xmath191 and @xmath192 consistent with mixed valent behaviour , while the quasiparticle weight @xmath193 implying a relatively low effective mass @xmath194 consistent with modest correlations . the resultant theoretical d.c .",
    "resistivity is shown in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ( solid line , with the @xmath195-axis scaled by @xmath196 and the @xmath197-axis by @xmath198 ) . and comparison to experiment",
    "is seen to be rather good for @xmath199 or so ( recall as above that transport for @xmath200 is dominated by variable range hopping  @xcite , which is naturally absent from the theory ) .",
    "the left panel shows the experimentally measured optical conductivity of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1  @xcite for various temperatures .",

    "an arrow marks the additional absorption seen as a shoulder , which arises at @xmath201 and thus compares well with the experimental value of @xmath202 .",
    "the theoretical direct gap peak appears at @xmath203 , while the corresponding experimental peak position is @xmath204 .",
    "the overall theoretical lineshape and its thermal evolution also matches rather well with experiment .",

    "single - particle spectra , as well as optical and d.c .",
    "conductivities , have been considered , and exhibit features specific to mixed - valent behaviour .",
    "the @xmath118-resolved conduction electron spectra are found to contain additional absorption features above the fermi level , giving rise in turn to an intrinsic shoulder - like absorption in the optical conductivity at frequencies lower than the direct ( mid - infrared ) gap .",
    "we emphasise that such a structure is found to be characteristic of the _ interacting mixed - valent _ case , and not restricted to either an insulating or metallic ground state.thus we believe that the shoulder - like feature seen experimentally in the optical conductivity of mixed - valent materials such as the insulator ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and the metal ybal@xmath2 , arises intrinsically from a combination of many - body scattering and intermediate valence . a direct comparison between theory and transport / optical experiments on ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 has been given .",
    "this yields good quantitative agreement , both reaffirming the view of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 as a mixed - valent hybridization gap material  @xcite and showing that the theory described here for generic mixed - valent kondo insulators can account for the transport / optical properties of these systems .",
