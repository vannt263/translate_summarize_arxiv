    "<S> to explain the linear polarization observed in spatially resolved structures in the solar atmosphere , the solution of polarized radiative transfer ( rt ) equation in multi - dimensional ( multi - d ) geometries is essential . for strong resonance lines partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) </S>",
    "<S> effects also become important . in a series of papers </S>",
    "<S> we have been investigating the nature of stokes profiles formed in multi - d media including prd in line scattering . for numerical simplicity </S>",
    "<S> so far we restricted our attention to the particular case of prd functions which are averaged over all the incident and scattered directions . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the polarized rt equation in multi - d media that takes into account hanle effect with angle - dependent prd functions . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize here to the multi - d case , the method of fourier series expansion of angle - dependent prd functions originally developed for rt in 1d geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the stokes source vector @xmath0 and the stokes vector @xmath1 can be expanded in terms of infinite sets of components @xmath2 , @xmath3 respectively , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the components @xmath2 become independent of the azimuthal angle ( @xmath5 ) of the scattered ray , whereas the components @xmath3 remain dependent on @xmath5 due to the nature of rt in multi - d geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we also establish that @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfy a simple transfer equation , which can be solved by any iterative method like an approximate lambda iteration ( ali ) or a biconjugate - gradient type projection method provided we truncate the fourier series to have a finite number of terms . </S>"
