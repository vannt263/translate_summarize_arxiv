    "the motion of a particle in the vicinity of a bounding surface is a long standing problem in colloidal science  @xcite .",
    "when a colloidal sphere suspended in a quiescent fluid approaches a wall , the drag force acting on it increases with respect to the drag force when far from the wall .",
    "this property is attributed to hydrodynamic interactions that develop because of the boundary conditions imposed by the wall on the fluid flow .",
    "in addition , the motion of the particle becomes anisotropic since the mobility is higher in the direction parallel to the wall than in the perpendicular direction .",
    "although the first investigations on the influence of a bounding wall date back to the early work of lorentz  @xcite , this field has known a certain revival during the past two decades .",
    "the main reason for this is certainly the achievement of technical progress , in particular in the field of single - molecule techniques , that allows nowadays to measure the position - dependent mobility of individual micron - size particles with a great accuracy . among the most efficient tools ,",
    "one can quote evanescent waves techniques  @xcite , single particle tracking by video - microscopy  @xcite , particle handling with optical tweezers  @xcite , afm noise analysis  @xcite , or fluorescent correlation spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "those various methods share the common feature of probing the random motion of brownian objects near one or two solid wall , and the the mobility coefficients deduced from the experimental data agree remarkably well with the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the renewal of interest for this question is also due to the development of microfluidics  @xcite .",
    "indeed , by reducing the size of the systems , the influence of surface effects are inevitably enhanced with respect to the bulk properties .",
    "consequently , most of the physical phenomena take place near the boundaries . a fundamental understanding on how surface properties might affect the overall flow field",
    "has therefore become crucial in order to propose new solutions that would take advantage of this predominance .",
    "lastly , it has been suggested recently to use colloidal particles as local probes of the flow properties near surfaces .",
    "this idea has been introduced in the context of the no - slip boundary condition  @xcite , where the motion of the particles is expected to contain a signature of the slip length  @xcite .",
    "more generally , one can think of a brownian particle as a probe of the viscoelastic properties of the bounding surface .    from a theoretical viewpoint , the motion of a solid particle in the presence of a nearby ,",
    "plane interface has been extensively studied in the past . during the last few years",
    ", calculations of mobility coefficients have been extended to particles near surfactant - covered interfaces  @xcite , in a liquid film between two fluids  @xcite , or in a poisseuile flow between planar walls  @xcite .",
    "the effect of fluid inertia has also been accounted for  @xcite , as well as the possibility of liquid slippage at the wall  @xcite . here ,",
    "we re - examine this question for a particle near a fluid - fluid interface .",
    "results are available for the drag force acting on a sphere of radius @xmath0 moving at a distance @xmath1 of a _ perfectly flat _ interface , up to second order in the ratio @xmath2  @xcite . while this problem is of some intrinsic interest , and is a logical starting point in the limit of very high surface tension , it is obvious that a real interface will generally deform owing to the motion of the particle . for _ finite _ surface tension , the motion of the particle is expected to be _ dynamically coupled _ to the conformations of the interface . indeed , the fluid flow caused by the displacement of the particle exerts stresses that deform the interface .",
    "relaxing back to its equilibrium position , the interface creates a backflow that in turn perturbs the motion of the particle , and so on . the delay in the response of the soft surface to hydrodynamic stresses",
    "is therefore expected to induce _ memory effects _ in the motion of the particle  @xcite .",
    "in general , the problem of the motion near a soft surface is highly non - linear due to the fact that the shape of the interface is unknown .",
    "althought it can not be solved exactly , iterative solutions have been derived when the deformation of the interface is asymptotically small  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to first solve the motion of a spherical bead near a flat surface .",
    "as the resulting velocity produces an imbalance of normal stress at the interface , it is then possible to determine a first nonzero approximation for the deformation  @xcite .",
    "this strategy is however limited as it only describes the first `` image '' correction to hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "also , it assumes a quasi - steady deformation profile and does not allow for a possible delay inherent in the response of an elastic interface .    in this article",
    ", we present an analytical method that rigorously accounts for the infinite series of hydrodynamic reflections on the soft interface .",
    "this scheme is achieved within the only assumption that interface deformations remain moderate .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ formulation ] , we specify the system and introduce the general set of equations that govern the problem .",
    "we reformulate in section  [ boundaries ] the small deformation problem in terms of equivalent boundary conditions at the undisplaced interface .",
    "results for the oseen tensor and the mobility coefficients are then discussed in section  [ mobility ] . in particular , we find that the frequency - dependent mobility switches between two regimes over a time scale corresponding to the relaxation time of the interface . finally , we come back to the relationship with experiments and draw some concluding remarks in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider a spherical particle of radius @xmath0 moving near a fluid interface in the low reynolds number regime .",
    "the interface separates two viscous , incompressible and immiscible fluids .",
    "its average position is chosen to coincide with the @xmath3    @xmath4 plane , with the @xmath5-coordinate directed perpendicular to the it .",
    "the two fluids are labelled with indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 , fluid @xmath6 lying above fluid @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we denote @xmath8 and @xmath9 the shear viscosities , @xmath10 and @xmath11 the mass densities , and @xmath12 the mass density difference . in order to get the mobility tensor of the particle",
    ", we shall first evaluate the appropriate green function  called the oseen tensor in this context  and investigate the effect of a time - dependent point force @xmath13 acting at position @xmath14 on the flow field  @xcite . without loss of generality , we can assume that the sphere is fully immersed in fluid @xmath6 . for small - amplitude and low - frequency motion , the flow velocity @xmath15 and",
    "the pressure @xmath16 are governed by the stokes equations @xmath17 with @xmath18 or @xmath7 , depending on whether the point @xmath19 is located above or below the interface . in eq .",
    "( [ stokes ] ) , @xmath20 stands for the dirac delta - distribution .",
    "the two fluids are assumed to be quiescent except for the disturbance flow caused by the motion of the sphere .",
    "the stokes equations have to be solved together with the usual boundary conditions at the interface , namely the velocity and the tangential constraints must be continuous",
    ". the normal - normal component of the stress tensor presents a discontinuity which is balanced by the restoring force exerted by the deformed interface on the fluid .",
    "this question is quite involved since , in principle , the tangential and normal directions depend on the _ local _ and _ instantaneous _ conformation of the interface .",
    "however , an approximate solution can be found for moderate deformations . in this case",
    ", the position of the almost flat interface can be described by a single - valued function @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . for our purpose",
    ", it is more convenient to use the two - dimensional fourier representation @xmath23 h(\\bm{\\rho},t ) \\ , \\label{fourierspace}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 .",
    "the elastic properties of the interface are then described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the surface tension and @xmath27 the capillary length , @xmath28 being the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the capillary length scale typically lies in the millimeter range for @xmath29  mn / m , but can be as low as a few microns for ultra - soft interfaces with @xmath30  @xmath31n / m  @xcite .",
    "we then proceed in the same manner as for linearized theory of capillary waves and express all the boundary conditions at the undisplaced interface @xmath32 .",
    "this hypothesis of smooth deformation is valid up to linear order in the deformation field @xmath33 , so that our approach is fully consistent with the harmonic description of the interface energy eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .      in spite of these classical simplifications",
    ", the coupling between the motion of the particle and the capillary waves leads to a rich behaviour . before solving the stokes equations , we first remark that the shape of the interface depends on the detailed history of the motion of the particle as well as on the shape at some earlier times .",
    "we are then naturally lead to perform a fourier mode analysis in time , the fourier transform @xmath34 of an arbitrary function @xmath35 being defined as @xmath36 f(t ) \\ . \\label{fouriertime}\\ ] ] besides , one can note that the problem is translationally invariant along the direction parallel to the surface .",
    "it is thus helpful to use the two - dimensional fourier representation introduced above in eq .",
    "( [ fourierspace ] ) .",
    "it also appears judicious for this study to decompose the vector fields into their longitudinal , transverse and normal components  @xcite .",
    "this defines a new set of orthogonal unit vectors @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the unit vector parallel to @xmath39 , @xmath40 the unit vector in the @xmath5-direction , and @xmath41 the in - plane vector perpendicular to @xmath38 and @xmath40 .",
    "these vectors are connected to the cartesian basis @xmath42 through @xmath43 the velocity and the force are written @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . inserting these representations into the stokes equations  ( [ stokes ] )    ( [ inc ] ) finally leads to a system of ordinary differential equations for the fourier - transformed quantities @xmath46 with the divergenceless condition @xmath47 although this framework is not as `` transparent '' as the usual image method , its advantages are twofold . on the one hand , it is particularly well suited to accommodate with the description of the interface energy in fourier space , since it thoroughly accounts for the symmetries of the problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse component of the velocity is decoupled from the longitudinal and normal directions .",
    "moreover , relation  ( [ incompressibility ] ) provides a usefull link between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , so that it is not difficult to get a single , fourth order differential equation for the normal component only @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the derivative of the dirac delta - distribution .",
    "to describe the flow in the presence of an interface , we must consider the flow on each side separately , and then require proper matching conditions for the velocity and surface forces .",
    "as stated above , the hypothesis of smooth deformations around the planar configuration enables us to express the boundary conditions at the undisplaced interface @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "because our representation of the velocity in terms of longitudinal and transverse coordinates is not commonly used in the litterature , we find it worthwhile to give some details regarding the derivation of the boundary values .",
    "first of all , we have to ensure that the velocity is continuous at the interface .",
    "explicitly , this requirement reads @xmath52 interestingly , the condition  ( [ vl0 ] ) for the _ longitudinal _ coordinate together with the incompressibility condition  ( [ incompressibility ] ) implies an additional boundary condition for the _ normal _ coordinate of the velocity , namely @xmath53      secondly , tangential stresses have to be balanced at the interface . in real space",
    ", the continuity condition for the normal - tangential components of the stress tensor reads @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 the stress tensor in cartesian coordinates .",
    "switching to @xmath57 variables , both requirements reduce to @xmath58 where the two - dimensional vector @xmath59 is the parallel velocity . projecting this equation onto the transverse direction leads to the condition @xmath60 whereas projection onto the longitudinal coordinate gives another condition which still involves both @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in order to obtain a boundary condition for the normal component only ,",
    "the incompressibility condition  ( [ incompressibility ] ) is once more invoked .",
    "we finally get @xmath61 note that the balance of _ tangential _ stresses is also relevant with regard to the _ normal _ component of the velocity .",
    "the next condition that has to be enforced concerns the normal - normal stress difference that comes into play whenever the interface is bent .",
    "indeed , a deformation of the interface gives rise to normal restoring forces , expressed as the functional derivative of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "for small displacements , the forces are small and proportionnal to @xmath33 .",
    "the normal stress condition reads , in real space , @xmath62 . in terms of the variables @xmath63",
    ", we have @xmath64 where we define the energy density @xmath65 .",
    "it can be seen that the normal stress difference at the interface is balanced by interfacial tension and buoyancy forces ( due to the density difference between the two fluids ) .",
    "this condition still involves both the normal component of the velocity as well as the pressure field . to get a relation in terms of @xmath49 only",
    ", we shall first use eq .",
    "( [ stokesl ] ) to express the pressure difference ( remember that @xmath66 ) @xmath67 substitute @xmath48 for @xmath49 thanks to relation  ( [ incompressibility ] ) , we arrive at the condition on the third derivative of the velocity @xmath68      to make the calculations tractable , we suppose that the condition of immiscibility can be written at @xmath32 .",
    "this approximation is justified since the fact that it is in any rigour valid at @xmath69 is an effect of higher order . within this assumption ,",
    "the time rate of change of the shape function is related to the normal velocity at the interface through @xmath70 up to linear order in the deformation field .",
    "this closure relation is especially relevant since , as shown in the following , it allows to work out the instantaneous deformation of the interface in response to hydrodynamic stresses .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to solve the stokes equations .",
    "because our calculations are algebraically involved , we save the details for the appendices .",
    "an interesting results is that the local deformation of the interface is directly proportional to the amplitude of the point force applied at height @xmath1 @xmath71 where the vector @xmath72 is the response function obtained thanks to the closure relation  ( [ closure ] ) . for a vertical force @xmath73",
    ", we find in appendix  [ zj ] @xmath74 as expected , the relaxation dynamics of the profile is governed by the _",
    "viscosity @xmath75 .",
    "the response of a deformation mode with wavevector @xmath39 is characterized by its relaxation rate @xmath76 remark that differents wavevectors are not damped in the same way .",
    "the amplitude of the response function is always maximum for @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "it then vanishes with increasing @xmath79 , all the more rapidly as the frequency @xmath80 or the distance @xmath1 are large .",
    "the result eq .",
    "( [ defz ] ) can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the real part of @xmath81 , which is in phase with the strain , is the analogous of a storage modulus for a viscoelastic medium  @xcite .",
    "this contribution corresponds to the elastic energy stored in the deformation of the interface . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath81 plays the role of a loss modulus and describes the viscous dissipation associated with the relaxation of individual deformation modes .    coming back to the motion of the interface in real space",
    ", one can evaluate the inverse fourier transform of the response function , though the calculations will not be performed here .",
    "a deformation may also be obtained as a result of a point force applied parallel to the interface .",
    "we find @xmath82 for the longitudinal and transverse coordinate , respectively .",
    "note that the shape of the interface is not affected by the transverse component of the force .",
    "the components of the oseen tensor are then obtained by identification with the definition @xmath83 where @xmath84 . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "the green function satisfies the general relation @xmath85 for @xmath5 and @xmath86 on the same side of the interface  @xcite .",
    "this is re - expressed in terms of our particular choice of variables as @xmath87 , property that can be checked along the calculations . as shown in the appendices , the green function",
    "can always be written as @xmath88 see appendix  [ tj ] for the exact expression of @xmath89 , appendix  [ zj ] for the components @xmath90 , and appendix  [ lj ] for the components @xmath91 . the first term , which depends only the relative distance @xmath92 , would reduce to the usual free - space green function if the viscosities were equal .",
    "the second term , @xmath93 , is the correction for an undistorted interface .",

    "indeed , the fluid flow resulting from a displacement of the particle exerts stresses that deform the interface .",
    "relaxing back to its equilibrium position , the interface creates a backflow that in turn perturbs the motion of the particle , and so forth .",
    "the infinite sum @xmath95 is the expression of this infinite series of `` reflexions '' of the original point force on the interface .",
    "this argument is confirmed by the fact that the correction vanishes for @xmath96 .",
    "one recovers the results for the flat liquid - liquid interface in the high surface tension limit , as expected .",
    "finally , once all the components are known in the @xmath97 basis , it is not difficult to express the oseen tensor in cartesian coordinates . in particular , the diagonal components are given by @xmath98 similar relations can be deduced for off - diagonal terms , though they will not be required in the following .      from the matrix elements of the oseen tensor , we can obtain the mobility matrix for a sphere .",
    "to this aim , we still have to enforce the no - slip boundary condition for the fluid flow on the surface of the particle . in the following , we assume that the particle is a sphere of radius @xmath0 .",
    "if we note @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively the translational and rotational velocity of the sphere , @xmath101 being the position of its center - of - mass , then the fluid velocity satisfies @xmath102 for any vector @xmath103 scanning the surface of the bead . integrating this relation over the particle ,",
    "one obtains a linear relation between the total friction force @xmath104 exerted by the liquid and velocity of the particle  @xcite .",

    "its real part @xmath129 represents the contribution to the viscous dissipation that comes from interface deformations . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath129 is positive for any value of the parameters , so that the real part of the mobility increases when the constraint on the shape of the interface is released .",
    "viscous dissipation is therefore _ always lower _ for a soft interface , which can bend under hydrodynamic forces , than for a rigid interface .",
    "another outcome is that the mobility of the particle also exhibits an imaginary part @xmath130 , which corresponds to the storage of elastic energy in the deformation of the interface . as shown on fig .",
