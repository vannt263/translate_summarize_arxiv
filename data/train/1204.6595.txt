    "the notion of an independent set plays a fundamental role in the study of hypergraphs .",
    "an @xmath0-uniform hypergraph , or @xmath0-_graph _ , @xmath1 is a pair @xmath14 comprising two sets , the vertices @xmath15 and edges @xmath16 of  @xmath1 , where each edge @xmath17 is a set of @xmath0  elements of  @xmath15 .",
    "hence a 2-graph is an ordinary graph .",
    "a set @xmath18 is _ independent _ if there is no edge @xmath17 with @xmath19 .",
    "whilst there are many theorems in the literature that can be phrased in terms of estimating the number of independent sets in certain hypergraphs ( we shall mention some of these shortly ) , the question _ per se _ of how many independent sets there can be in a graph has attracted attention only relatively lately . the maximum number of independent sets in a graph of given average degree can be determined easily via the kruskal - katona theorem  @xcite , but for regular graphs the maximum is harder to find : following a good estimate by alon  @xcite , the exact value for bipartite graphs was determined by kahn  @xcite via an elegant entropy argument , and his result was extended to all graphs by zhao  @xcite .",
    "there are at most @xmath20 independent sets in a @xmath3-regular graph of order@xmath21 ( that is , having @xmath10 vertices ) , and this number is attained by @xmath22 disjoint copies of @xmath23 .",
    "it would be convenient for many purposes if there were at most @xmath24 independent sets in an @xmath0-graph @xmath1 of order  @xmath10 and average degree  @xmath3 , but examples like those just cited show this hope to be a forlorn one .",
    "nevertheless , for the applications we have in mind , it is enough to find a good collection @xmath2 of _ containers _ for independent sets : this is a family of subsets of @xmath15 such that , for each independent set @xmath25 , there is a set @xmath26 with @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . of course",
    ", we could just take @xmath29 , but this collection would not be helpful : for @xmath2 to be of use , a further condition is needed that each container @xmath26 is not large , in a sense made precise later .    another immediate candidate for @xmath2 is the collection of _ maximal _ independent sets , but this too can be large ; for example , if @xmath3 is even , adding a @xmath30-factor into the vertex classes of each @xmath23 of the graph @xmath31 produces a @xmath32-regular graph with at least @xmath33 maximal independent sets .",
    "( the maximum number of maximal independent sets in any graph of order  @xmath10 was determined by moon and moser  @xcite . )    the main purpose of this paper is to show that an @xmath0-graph  @xmath1 of average degree  @xmath3 and order  @xmath10 does have a small collection @xmath2 of containers .",
    "typically , but not always , @xmath34 .",
    "results of this kind were known previously in special cases .",
    "sapozhenko  @xcite treated regular 2-graphs .",
    "containers for @xmath0-graphs were introduced and used in  @xcite in the case of simple regular @xmath0-graphs ( a hypergraph is _ simple _ or _ linear _ if every pair of vertices lies in at most one edge ) . however , the most interesting applications require containers for non - regular @xmath0-graphs . finding such containers",
    "presents significant difficulties and the method here is unrelated to that of  @xcite .",
    "we describe our main results about containers in   [ sec : containers ] .",
    "the fundamental result is theorem  [ thm : cover ] stated in   [ subsec : mainthm ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the statement applies to all @xmath0-graphs  @xmath1 but it gives useful information only if @xmath3 is large ( though independently of  @xmath10 ) .",
    "following   [ sec : containers ] , the containers are constructed in   [ sec : online ] and their properties analysed in   [ sec : calc ] , where theorem  [ thm : cover ] is proved .",
    "some corollaries , more amenable to application , are developed in   [ sec : iteration ] and   [ sec : uniform ] , and in   [ sec : largecont ] we give an example to show that the main result is , in a sense , best possible .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : list][sec : sparse ] we give details of some applications .    before getting down to details , though , we outline those applications to be discussed .",
    "each of them involves , implicitly , dealing with the independent sets in some hypergraph  @xmath1 , and in each case it suffices to find an appropriate set of containers .",
    "once some simple parameter of @xmath1 has been calculated , the existence of the desired containers follows straight away from the main theorem or one of its consequences in   [ sec : iteration][sec : uniform ] , and the applications are finished off by routine arguments ( plus , in   [ sec : sumfree ] , a non - trivial removal lemma ) .",
    "the results obtained are generally best possible .",
    "balogh , morris and samotij  @xcite have independently developed a container theorem akin to corollary  [ cor : sparse_container ] together with applications , including a proof of theorem  [ thm : klr3 ] for balanced graphs .",
    "we use standard notation .",
    "in particular , for @xmath35 we let @xmath36=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] and @xmath37=\\{m,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] . for collections of subsets we write , for example , @xmath37^{(s)}=\\{\\sigma\\subset[m , n]:|\\sigma|=s\\}$ ] , @xmath37^{(>s)}=\\{\\sigma\\subset[m , n]:|\\sigma|>s\\}$ ] , and so on .",
    "as usual , @xmath38 $ ] denotes the collection of all subsets of  @xmath36 $ ] . if @xmath1 is a hypergraph we write @xmath39 for the number of edges of  @xmath1 and @xmath40 for the number of vertices of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath41 then @xmath42 $ ] denotes the subhypergraph of @xmath1 induced by  @xmath43 , that is , @xmath42=(s , e(g)\\cap\\mathcal{p } s)$ ] .",
    "a @xmath44-graph @xmath1 is said to be @xmath9-_choosable _ if , whenever for each vertex @xmath45 we assign a list @xmath46 of @xmath9 colours to  @xmath47 , then it is possible to choose a colour for @xmath47 from the list  @xmath46 , so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same colour . the _ list chromatic number _ @xmath48 ( also called the _ choice number _ ) is the smallest @xmath9 such that @xmath1 is @xmath9-choosable .",
    "if all the lists are the same then a list colouring is just an ordinary @xmath9-colouring and so @xmath48 is at least @xmath49 , the ordinary chromatic number of  @xmath1 .",
    "this natural definition was first studied by vizing  @xcite and by erds , rubin and taylor  @xcite .",
    "one of the main discoveries of  @xcite is that @xmath48 can be much larger than @xmath49 , because @xmath50 , whereas @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , unlike @xmath49 , @xmath48 must grow with the minimum degree of the graph  @xmath1 .",
    "alon  @xcite showed that @xmath52 holds for any graph @xmath1 of minimum degree  @xmath3 .",
    "there is a straightforward reason , as pointed out by alon and kostochka  @xcite , why the same is not true for @xmath0-graphs if @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath53 be some graph on @xmath10 vertices , say @xmath54 , and let @xmath1 be some @xmath0-graph each of whose edges contains an edge of  @xmath53 . then @xmath55 , so in this example @xmath56 , whereas the average degree of @xmath1 can be large",
    ". however , if we restrict to simple @xmath0-graphs the situation is different . following work of haxell and pei  @xcite on steiner systems , haxell and verstrate",
    "@xcite proved that @xmath57 for simple @xmath3-regular @xmath58-graphs  @xmath1 .",
    "alon and kostochka  @xcite showed @xmath59 for simple @xmath3-regular @xmath0-graphs  @xmath1 , and in  @xcite this was improved to @xmath60 .",
    "we extend this to all simple @xmath0-graphs , at the same time giving a better constant .",
    "[ thm : chil ] let @xmath61 be fixed .",
    "let @xmath1 be a simple @xmath0-graph with average degree  @xmath3 . then , as @xmath62 , @xmath63 holds .",
    "moreover , if @xmath1 is regular then @xmath64    note that , for @xmath5 , this improves alon s bound  @xcite by a factor of  2 and is best possible .",
    "we think that the bound given for regular @xmath0-graphs might hold for general @xmath0-graphs and moreover that it too might be best possible ( see   [ sec : list ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : chil ] is a weaker version of corollary  [ cor : chil ] , which gives a bound for some non - simple @xmath0-graphs also .",
    "we do not give a general bound for all @xmath0-graphs because it would be rather complicated to state : however , in any particular instance , a bound can readily be derived from the results in   [ sec : list ] .",
    "this would cover , for example the theorem of alon and kostochka  @xcite that if at least half the @xmath65-tuples of vertices of @xmath1 lie in at least @xmath66 edges then @xmath67 .",
    "an @xmath7-graph on vertex set @xmath68 $ ] is said to be @xmath8-_free _ if it contains no subgraph isomorphic to the @xmath7-graph  @xmath8 .",
    "as far as @xmath8-free graphs are concerned , our main result is this : for any given @xmath7-graph @xmath8 , though there are many @xmath8-free @xmath7-graphs , each of these is contained in one of a very few @xmath7-graphs that are almost @xmath8-free .",

    "the reason for the remarks just made is that , whilst we do attempt to motivate the construction , we can not do so fully because it is hard to explain why one construction should work when another similar one does not .",
    "the devil is sometimes in the detail , and a prolonged discussion would be unjustified .",
    "there are two aspects to the construction : the production of a suitable small set @xmath89 from a set  @xmath25 , which we call _ pruning _ , and the production of @xmath85 from  @xmath89 , which we call _ building_. ( in fact , as mentioned already , we produce not just one small set but an @xmath0-tuple @xmath219 of small sets . )",
    "these two aspects are very closely intertwined , and it is convenient to describe both in terms of a single algorithm which has two slightly differing modes , a _ build mode _ and a _ prune mode_.      given an @xmath0-graph @xmath1 with vertex set @xmath36 $ ] , and a sequence of subsets @xmath286 of  @xmath36 $ ] , we produce a sequence of @xmath287-_multigraphs _",
    "@xmath288 for @xmath289 .",
    "this means that @xmath288 is @xmath287-uniform but multiple edges are allowed ; in other words @xmath290 is a _",
    "multiset_.    each edge @xmath291 with @xmath292 will come from an edge @xmath293 , where @xmath294 and @xmath295 , @xmath296 .",
    "equivalently , each edge of @xmath288 is an edge of @xmath297 whose first vertex , which is in  @xmath298 , has been removed .",
    "the reason @xmath288 is defined as a multigraph , even if @xmath1 itself does not have multiple edges , is so that distinct edges of @xmath1 give rise to distinct edges of @xmath288 .",
    "the multigraph @xmath299 is @xmath30-uniform : its edges are single vertices .",
    "if @xmath25 is an independent set and the sets @xmath300 are chosen within @xmath25 , as they will be , then evidently the members of @xmath301 can not be vertices in @xmath25 , and so the container @xmath85 can be chosen from vertices not in  @xmath301 .",
    "our first aim , then , is to ensure that @xmath301 is as large as possible , and to this end we attempt to make @xmath290 large for each  @xmath287 .",
    "however this aim has to be balanced against keeping the sets @xmath298 small .",
    "hence we shall choose a parameter @xmath179 , so that , roughly speaking , @xmath298 will comprise a proportion @xmath179 of the vertices ( in degree measure ) , and we might hope the size of @xmath290 to be roughly @xmath179 times the size of @xmath302 .",
    "this means the average degree of @xmath288 will typically be around @xmath303 .",
    "the parameter @xmath179 is the same as that discussed in   [ subsec : codeg ] and the constraint @xmath204 described there is precisely what is needed to ensure that @xmath301 contains something worthwhile .",
    "however not every edge of @xmath1 with its first @xmath304 vertices in @xmath305 will be admitted as an edge of  @xmath288 , but only a selection of these .",
    "we do not allow edges into @xmath288 if they increase the degree of some vertex , or the degree of some subset @xmath306 $ ] , beyond some agreed threshold .",
    "we define the degree of @xmath173 in the multigraph  @xmath288 to be @xmath307 where we note that here we are counting edges with multiplicity in the multiset @xmath290 .",
    "( naturally we may write @xmath308 instead of @xmath309 if @xmath275 $ ] . )",
    "there are several reasons for wanting to bound the degrees in @xmath288 .",
    "one reason is the hope of keeping the vertex degrees near to @xmath310 times the degrees in  @xmath1 , so that degree measure in @xmath288 relates to measure in  @xmath1 ; in particular , small sets of vertices can not account for most of the edges of @xmath288 unless those sets have large measure in  @xmath1 .",
    "a second reason for controlling degrees of subsets is that only by doing so can we restrain the degrees of vertices at later stages : this comes out in the proof of lemma  [ lem : maxdeg ] .",
    "so we proceed in the following way .",
    "we begin with @xmath311 , and then apply the straightforward algorithm below to construct @xmath288 from @xmath297 using @xmath298 , with @xmath287 taking the values @xmath312 in turn . during the application of the algorithm , the degrees @xmath313 in @xmath288 will grow , as edges are added .",
    "we denote by @xmath314 the collection of vertices and subsets whose degrees have reached their bound , and we do not permit the addition to @xmath288 of any edge which contains a current member of @xmath314 .",
    "the set @xmath314 will grow too during the construction .",
    "as mentioned before , the algorithm can be run in two modes : prune mode and build mode .",
    "the aim of successive runs of prune mode is to produce sets @xmath315 , and the aim of build mode is to produce sets @xmath316 which will form the basis of a container .",
    "thus in a single run of prune mode , an independent set @xmath25 is input and some set @xmath298 is output , whereas in build mode a set @xmath298 is input and a set @xmath317 is output .",
    "both forms of the algorithm include the construction of @xmath288 from  @xmath297 .",
    "the essential difference between the modes is this .",
    "the algorithm inspects the vertices in @xmath36 $ ] one by one . in prune mode , where @xmath25 is part of the input ,",
    "if the vertex is in @xmath25 a decision is made , according to some rule , whether to place the vertex into @xmath298 . in build mode , where @xmath298 is input but @xmath25 is not , the vertex is inspected to see whether it passes the rule ; if it passes , but the vertex is not in  @xmath298 , we know it could not have been in  @xmath25 , so it is removed from @xmath317 ( with the aim of making a container via @xmath317 ) . in both modes , if the vertex is in @xmath298 , appropriate edges are added to @xmath288 .",
    "two real numbers are included in the input to the algorithm .",

    "the degree threshold for a vertex entering @xmath314 is in terms of its degree @xmath341 in the original graph @xmath1 , whereas for a larger subset @xmath173 it is in terms of its degree in @xmath297 ; this difference is for technical reasons arising in the proof of theorem  [ thm : cover ] .",
    "clearly , if in prune mode we construct @xmath298 from @xmath25 , then , when in build mode with the same set @xmath298 as input , the condition @xmath331 can happen only if either @xmath342 or @xmath343 .",
    "evidently , therefore , @xmath344 , so @xmath345 is one option for a container for  @xmath25 .",
