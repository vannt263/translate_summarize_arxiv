    "predicting the future state of a system had always been a natural motivation for science development , with applications such as weather forecasting and tidal prediction .",
    "understanding the limitations to the predictability of a system evolution is therefore crucial .    in deterministic systems , where the future is uniquely determined by the present ,",
    "two main approaches to the predictability problem can be addressed .",
    "the first refers to systems whose evolution laws are known , either in terms of differential or difference equations . in this case , the predictability is mainly limited by the presence of sensitivity to initial conditions ( deterministic chaos ) , which as taught in dynamical system courses , is characterized by the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the second approach refers to phenomena whose governing laws are not known , but whose evolution can be measured and recorded . in such a case , the best practical strategy is to use the past , as a full - scale model of the system , to make predictions on the future evolution .",
    "the present paper discusses at an introductory level the latter method , which was developed in the framework of nonlinear time series analysis.@xcite this topic is seldom included in basic courses and is closely related to an apparently distant classical theme  the poincar recurrences.@xcite surprisingly , although simple to establish,@xcite such a connection has been overlooked even by specialists , as recently remarked by altmann and kantz.@xcite such a link also allows us to clarify the practical role of theoretical concepts as the attractor dimension of a dynamical system . indeed , as we shall see , when the evolution laws are unknown , the actual constraints to our prediction capabilities are rather set by the number of degrees of freedom ( attractor dimension ) than by the presence of chaos .",
    "this fact is often overlooked in favor of the widespread folklore of the _ butterfly effect_.@xcite in this respect , it is important to stress that such limitations to predictability are a consequence of rather general results of ergodic and dynamical - system theory . although the main ideas had been already put forward by boltzmann,@xcite many misguided applications of nonlinear time series analysis appeared in the literature after the rediscovery of chaos ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "likely , one of the main reasons for excluding this topic from basic courses is the necessity to introduce advanced technical tools@xcite as , for example , the embedding technique.@xcite therefore , here , we present the problem in its simplest formulation . often , when recording the evolution of a system with unknown dynamics , not all the variables necessary to identify the states or even their number are known . moreover , if luckily we know them , we can access only one or a few scalar functions of them , typically affected by measurement errors . throughout this paper , we will disregard all these technical difficulties ( which can be to a large extent handled with specific techniques  @xcite ) and assume that the necessary variables can be recorded with arbitrary precision .",
    "even with such ideal working hypothesis , the above mentioned fundamental constraints to predictability are unavoidable .",
    "the material is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , after some historical notes , we introduce the method of analogues as the simplest procedure to predict the future from past time series . sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] introduces the model system used to clarify the main issues . in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we discuss the link between analogues and poincar recurrences , and show how the actual limitations to predictability from data stems from the effective number of degrees of freedom . sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] discusses two cases where the method works successfully , one is illustrated by a numerical example and the other refers to the important practical problem of tidal predictions .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "`` if a system behaves in a certain way , it will do again '' seems a rather natural claim when referred , for instance , to the diurnal and seasonal cycles , also supported by biblical tradition : _ what has been will be again , what has been done will be done again ; there is nothing new under the sun _ [ the qohelet s book 1:9 niv ] .",
    "this idea , together with the belief in determinism ( _ from the same antecedents follow the same consequents _ ) , is at the basis of prediction methods .",
    "however , as maxwell argued:@xcite _ it is a metaphysical doctrine that from the same antecedents follow the same consequents.@xmath0 $ ] but it is not of much use in a world like this , in which the same antecedents never again concur , and nothing ever happens twice.@xmath0 $ ] the physical axiom which has a somewhat similar aspect is `` that from like antecedents follow like consequents . ''",
    "_ these words no more surprise the scientists , aware , by now , of the almost exceptional character of periodic behaviors and of the ubiquitous presence of irregular evolutions due to deterministic chaos ; but at that time they constituted a rupture with the tradition .    in spite of maxwell authoritative opinion , until world war i , weather forecasters substantially used empirical implementations of the naive idea , exploiting their experience and memory of past similar `` patterns '' ( roughly surfaces of discontinuity between warm and cold air masses ) to produce weather map predictions.@xcite in the preface to his seminal book _ weather prediction by numerical process _ , richardson criticizes the empirical approaches and , through an argument similar to that by maxwell,@xcite contends that for weather forecasting it is much more useful integrating the partial differential ( namely the thermo - hydrodynamical ) equations ruling the atmosphere .",
    "although , as history witnessed , the successful approach to predictions is that foreseen by richardson , it is interesting to discuss the range of applicability of predictions based on the past evolution of a deterministic system .",
    "a mathematical formulation of the idea was due to lorenz and it is called _ method of analogues_,@xcite which can be considered as the most straightforward approach to predictability in the absence of a detailed knowledge of the physical laws .",
    "in its simplest description , the method works as follows .",
    "assume that the known state @xmath1 of a process can be sampled at times @xmath2 with arbitrary precision .",
    "the sampling interval @xmath3 is also assumed to be arbitrary but not too short .",
    "we collect the sequence of states @xmath4 with @xmath5 . if from the present state @xmath6 , we would like to forecast the future @xmath7 at time @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , the basic idea is to search in the past @xmath10 that state , say @xmath11 , most similar to @xmath6 , and to use its consequents as proxies for the future evolution of @xmath12 .",
    "mathematically , we require that @xmath13 , and we dub @xmath11 a @xmath14-_analogue _ to @xmath12 . if the analogue were perfect ( @xmath15 ) the system ( being deterministic ) would be surely periodic and the prediction trivial : @xmath16 for any @xmath17 .",
    "if it were not perfect ( @xmath18 ) , we could use the forecasting recipe @xmath19 as _ from like antecedents follow like consequents _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : analogue]a ) . for the prediction ( [ eq : simplepred ] ) to be meaningful , the analogue @xmath11 must not be a near - in - time antecedent .",
    "when more than one analogue can be found , the generalization of ( [ eq : simplepred ] ) is obvious , see fig .",
    "[ fig : analogue]b .    ) and of the error growth ; ( b ) generalization of the method to more than one analogue .",
    "in particular , if @xmath20 analogues , @xmath21 are found ( [ eq : simplepred ] ) can be replaced by @xmath22 where the matrices @xmath23 can be computed by suitable interpolations .",
    "[ fig : analogue],scaledwidth=43.0% ]    once a `` good '' analogue ( meaning @xmath14 reasonably small ) has been found , the next step is to determine the accuracy of the prediction ( [ eq : simplepred ] ) , namely the difference between the forecast and the actual state @xmath24 . in practice",
    ", the @xmath14-analogue is the present state with an uncertainty , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , and the prediction ( [ eq : simplepred ] ) can be considered acceptable until the error @xmath27 remains below a tolerance @xmath28 , dictated by the practical needs .",
    "the predictability time @xmath29 is then defined by requiring @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "accuracy and predictability time @xmath32 are clearly related to ( possible ) sensitivity to initial conditions , as pioneered by lorenz himself.@xcite as taught in basic dynamical system courses , chaotic evolutions exponentially amplify an infinitesimal error : @xmath33 @xmath34 being the maximal lyapunov exponent.@xcite for a gentle introduction to lyapunov exponents the reader may refer to ref .  .",
    "therefore , given a good analogue the prediction will be @xmath28-accurate up to a time @xmath35 strictly speaking , for the above equation to be valid , both @xmath36 and @xmath28 must be very small.@xcite it is worth remarking that the evaluation of the error growth rate ( [ eq : lyap ] ) provides , at least in principle , a way to determine the lyapunov exponent @xmath34 from a long time series .",
    "conversely , deterministic non - chaotic systems are less sensitive to initial conditions : the error grows polynomially in time , and usually , @xmath37 results to be longer than that of chaotic systems , making long term predictions possible .",
    "for those familiar with chaotic systems , we apparently reached the obvious conclusion that the main limit to predictions based on analogues is the sensitivity to initial conditions , typical of chaos .",
    "but , as realized by lorenz himself , the main issue is to find good ( small @xmath14 ) analogues:@xcite _ in practice this procedure may be expected to fail , because of the high probability that no truly good analogues will be found within the recorded history of the atmosphere .",
    "_ he also pointed out that the very drawback of the method stems from the need of a very large data set,@xcite independently of the presence of chaos .",
    "it is worth concluding this historical presentation with a brief comment on the application of the method of analogues in the original lorenz s work.@xcite lorenz was strongly supporting weather forecasting based on solving the ( approximate ) equations of the atmosphere , as outlined by richardson .",
    "he realized that the intrinsic limits to weather forecasting can not be established by estimating the intrinsic error growth of these solutions .",
    "this work represents the first attempt to estimate the lyapunov exponent from data , pioneering the modern time series analysis.@xcite unfortunately , he also realized that , the true lyapunov exponent of the atmosphere can not be estimated from data , as good analogues can not be found and the _ difference between mediocre analogues may be expected to amplify more slowly than the difference between good analogues , since the non linear effects play a greater role when the errors are large_.",
    "the difficulties in finding good analogues can be quantified by studying analogue statistics . as an illustrative example , we compute numerically the probability of finding @xmath14-analogues to a state in a simple model system introduced by lorenz in 1996,@xcite hence called lorenz-96 model .",
    "it consists of the following nonlinearly coupled ordinary differential equations @xmath38 where @xmath39 and periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath40 ) are assumed .",
    "the variables @xmath41 may be thought of as the values of some atmospheric representative observable along the latitude circle , so that eq .  ( [ l96 ] ) can be regarded as a one - dimensional caricature of atmospheric motion.@xcite the quadratic coupling conserves energy , @xmath42 . in the presence of forcing @xmath43 and damping @xmath44 ,",
    "the energy is only statistically conserved . the motion is thus confined to a bounded region of @xmath45",
    ". moreover , dissipation constraints the trajectories to evolve onto a subset of this region possibly with dimension @xmath46 , namely an attractor ( fixed points , limit cycles or a _ strange attractor _ if the dynamics is chaotic ) .",
    "the dynamical features are completely determined by the forcing strength @xmath43 and by the system dimensionality @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath48 and @xmath49 the system displays chaos with exponential separation of nearby initial conditions.@xcite    in principle , the statistics of the analogues of system ( [ l96 ] ) can be determined according to the following procedure .",
    "given a state of the system @xmath50 on the attractor , we have to consider its precursors @xmath51 along the trajectory ending in @xmath6 sampled at regular time intervals of duration @xmath3 , @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the @xmath14-analogues of @xmath6 are those states @xmath53 such that @xmath54 . finally , the fraction of @xmath14-analogues , @xmath55 provides an estimate of the probability to find @xmath14-analogues to @xmath6 as a function of both the desired degree of similarity @xmath14 and the length of the history @xmath56 we recorded . being interested in typical behaviors and not just in the properties around a specific state @xmath6 , it is convenient to average @xmath57 over @xmath58 independent reference states .",
    "therefore , instead of considering only the end point @xmath6 , we select @xmath58 states @xmath59 along the trajectory , well spaced in time to be considered independent configurations on the attractor , and we replace ( [ anafrac ] ) by the average fraction of @xmath14-analogues @xmath60 as in our case we know the evolution laws ( [ l96 ] ) , it is not really necessary to look at the backward time series of the reference states . in practice , we can select the @xmath59 and look at their forward @xmath14-analogues .",
    "the latter procedure is used to produce fig .",
    "[ corrx ] , where we show @xmath61 obtained with @xmath62 reference states and different lengths @xmath56 of the time series , from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "of course , when the degree of similarity @xmath14 becomes larger than the attractor size , say @xmath65 , the fraction @xmath61 saturates to @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to normalize the degree of similarity by @xmath67 . as for the dynamics ( [ l96 ] ) , the forcing is fixed to @xmath68 and we consider two system sizes @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in both cases",
    "the system is chaotic .",
    "while for @xmath70 analogues can be found with reasonable probability even for small values of @xmath71 , for @xmath69 analogues are found only for large values of @xmath72 , even for @xmath73 .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ corrx ] indicate that for @xmath74 the probability to find an analogue is fairly well approximated by a power law @xmath75 in particular , we find @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath70 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the exponent @xmath78 quantifies the difference between the two cases : upon lowering @xmath14 , the probability to find @xmath14-analogues with @xmath69 becomes about @xmath79 times smaller than with @xmath70 .",
    "the probability to find @xmath14-analogues is expected to decrease upon increasing the number of degrees of freedom @xmath47 , as more constraints on the single components of the state vector should be satisfied . in this perspective",
    ", the above result seems at odds with intuition unless the exponent @xmath78 in ( [ eq : plaw ] ) is interpreted as the `` effective '' number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we end this section by warning the reader that the counter - intuitive inequality @xmath80 is a peculiar consequence of the choice of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath47.@xcite generally , @xmath78 is expected to increase with @xmath47.@xcite here , we made this choice to emphasize the importance of the effective number of degrees of freedom that , in general , is not trivially related to ( and can be much smaller than ) the number of variables @xmath47 .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , @xmath78 is nothing but the attractor dimension , a measure of the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "in this section we recall some basic notions of ergodic dynamical systems and underline their connections with the analogues . in particular , we link the difficulty of finding analogues to the presence of long recurrence times .",
    "the founding principle of ergodic theory is that the long - time statistical properties of a system can be equivalently described in terms of the invariant ( time - independent ) probability , @xmath81 , such that @xmath82 is the probability of finding the system in any specified region @xmath83 of its phase space .",
    "the phase space of a system described by @xmath47 degrees of freedom is a region of @xmath45 , that is a @xmath47-dimensional space .    if the evolution conserves phase - space volumes ( as in the hamiltonian motion of classical systems ) then the probability @xmath84 of finding the state in a small region of volume @xmath85 as defined in elementary geometry , around @xmath86 is proportional to @xmath87 , i.e. to the lebesgue measure of that region . in dissipative systems ,",
    "phase - space volumes are contracted on average and the invariant probability @xmath84 is not proportional to @xmath87 , but concentrates on a set ( the attractor ) @xmath88 of dimension @xmath89 .",
    "slightly more formally , the dimension @xmath78 describes the small scale ( @xmath90 ) behavior of the probability @xmath91 of finding points @xmath92 which are in the @xmath47-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath93 around @xmath94 : @xmath95 therefore , the trajectories of dissipative systems are effectively described by a number @xmath96 of degrees of freedom , though defined in a @xmath47-dimensional space .    for a non - integer @xmath78 attractor and probability",
    "are said to be fractal . in general , attractors are non - homogeneous with @xmath78 , in eq .",
    "( [ frac - dim ] ) , depending on @xmath94 , and an infinite set of dimensions is needed to fully characterize the invariant probability  we speak of multifractal objects.@xcite for the sake of our discussion , these technical complications can be ignored , and the attractor can be assumed homogeneous and characterized by a single dimension @xmath78 .    upon reconsidering @xmath57",
    "defined in eq .",
    "( [ anafrac ] ) , we see that it is nothing but the fraction of time the trajectory spends in a sphere or radius @xmath14 centered in @xmath97 . for large @xmath56 , as a consequence of ergodicity , @xmath57 gives the probability of finding the system in that sphere , and the quantity ( [ grasspro ] ) is an averaged probability .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large @xmath56 and small @xmath14 , eq .  ( [ frac - dim ] ) implies @xmath98 strictly speaking , in eq .",
    "( [ c - df ] ) the right exponent should be the correlation dimension @xmath99 , which controls the small scale asymptotics of the probability to find two points on the attractor at distance @xmath100.@xcite thanks to the homogeneity assumption , however , we have @xmath101 .     vs. @xmath102 for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; the reference states are @xmath103 and different values of @xmath56 ranging from @xmath63 to @xmath64 are considered .",
    "the solid lines are the fits of the data by means of relation  ( [ c - df]).[corrx],scaledwidth=44.0% ]    relation ( [ c - df ] ) links the observed behavior ( [ eq : plaw ] ) in fig .",
    "[ corrx ] to the attractor dimension , showing that the limiting factor to find good analogues is the attractor dimension , which quantifies the number of `` active '' degrees of freedom of the system . for those accustomed to chaotic systems , this result is rather obvious as @xmath61 in ( [ grasspro ] ) provides a standard approximation@xcite to the correlation sum , @xmath104 , at the basis of the grassberger and procaccia method to determine the correlation dimension @xmath99.@xcite indeed , the correlation sum is an unbiased estimator of the probability @xmath105 to find two randomly chosen points on the attractor ( using a long trajectory on it ) at a distance @xmath100 . for small @xmath14 , @xmath106 and",
    "thus the correlation dimension can be estimated.@xcite      the quantity @xmath57 , besides approaching ( for large @xmath56 ) the probability to find the system state @xmath14-close to @xmath6 , relates to the average time interval @xmath107 between two consecutive @xmath14-analogues of @xmath6 , which is given by @xmath108 @xmath109 being the number of @xmath14-analogues in the interval @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "as by definition @xmath111 we have @xmath112 actually this is a classical result of the ergodic theory  known as kac s lemma .    to clarify this connection ,",
    "it is worth recalling the poincar recurrence theorem@xcite stating that , in hamiltonian systems with a bounded phase space @xmath113 , the trajectories exiting from a generic set @xmath114 will return back to @xmath83 infinitely many times .",
    "the theorem holds for almost all points in @xmath83 except for a possible subset of zero probability . in general",
    ", it applies to the class of systems with volume - preserving dynamics in phase - space , of which hamiltonian ones are a particular sub - class .",
    "actually , although often not stressed in elementary courses , it can be straightforwardly extended to dissipative ergodic systems provided one only considers initial conditions on the attractor and `` zero probability '' is interpreted with respect to the invariant probability on the attractor .",
    "poincar theorem merely proves that a trajectory surely return to the neighborhood of its starting point , but does not provide information about the time between two consecutive recurrences  the poincar recurrence time .",
    "the latter is crucial to the method of analogues because long recurrence times critically spoil its applicability ( see eq .",

    "let us assume that an infinitely long sequence of states can be stored . without loss of generality , we consider a discrete time sequence @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) of states generated by a deterministic evolution from the initial condition @xmath117 .",
    "given a set @xmath83 including @xmath117 , the recurrence time of @xmath118 relative to @xmath83 , @xmath119 , can be defined as the minimum @xmath120 such that @xmath11 is again in @xmath83 @xmath121 note that we are using dimensionless times with @xmath122 .",
    "the mean recurrence time relative to @xmath83 , @xmath123 , can then be computed as @xmath124 @xmath81 being the invariant probability with respect to the dynamics , defined in the previous subsection . for ergodic dynamics ,",

    "thus , the conclusions of the previous section are very pessimistic : when @xmath78 is that large only _ mediocre _ analogues ( rather large @xmath14 ) can be found and those are , from the point of view of predictability , usually not so informative about the future evolution of the system.@xcite    it is instructive , however , to consider here two exceptions to this rule , namely : a variation on the theme of the lorenz-96 model ( [ l96 ] ) and briefly discuss tidal predictions which represent , to the best of our knowledge , one of the few instances in which the idea of using the past to predict the future works and has still important practical applications .",
    "we consider here systems with a multiscale structure , where the vector state @xmath86 can be decomposed into a slow component @xmath169 which is also the `` largest '' one , and a fast component @xmath170 `` small '' with respect to @xmath169 ( i.e. @xmath171 ) .",
    "if the slow components can be described in terms of an `` effective number '' of degrees of freedom much smaller than those necessary to characterize the whole dynamics , mediocre ( referred to the whole system ) analogues can be used to forecast at least the slower evolving component . as an illustration of such kind of system we consider a variant of the model ( [ l96 ] ) introduced by lorenz himself@xcite to discuss the predictability problem in the atmosphere , where indeed a multiscale structure is present .",
    "the model reads @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 with boundary conditions @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 . equation  ( [ lore2scalea ] ) is essentially ( [ l96 ] ) but for the last term which couples @xmath178 to @xmath179 .",
    "the variables @xmath94 evolve with a similar dynamics but are @xmath180 times faster and @xmath181 times smaller in amplitude .",
    "the parameter @xmath182 , set to @xmath66 , controls the coupling strength .     vs. @xmath183 for model ( [ lore2scalea]-[lore2scaleb ] ) computed for three scale separations @xmath181 ( as labeled ) holding the other parameters fixed at @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the gray straight line has slope @xmath189 while the dashed lines have all the same slope @xmath190 .",
    "the quantity ( [ grasspro ] ) has been computed with @xmath191 and @xmath192.[multi ] , scaledwidth=44.0% ]    we repeat the computation to measure the probability of @xmath14-analogues for the dynamics ( [ lore2scalea]-[lore2scaleb ] ) , by assuming that the whole state of the system @xmath193 is accessible , and by ignoring which are the slow and fast variables , so that we must search for the analogues in the sequence of states @xmath194 , with @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ multi ] shows @xmath61 as a function of @xmath195 for a long sequence , @xmath192 , for fixed time scale separation @xmath185 and taking the fast component @xmath179 respectively @xmath196 and @xmath197 times smaller than the slow one @xmath178 .",
    "the phase - space dimensionality is @xmath198 , with @xmath187 slow and @xmath188 fast degrees of freedom .",
    "the attractor dimension of the whole system @xmath78 , given by the scaling @xmath199 at very small @xmath14 , is rather large ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath201 we see a second power law @xmath202 with @xmath203 which defines a sort of `` effective dimension at large scale '' .",
    "therefore , if we are interested in predicting the slow evolving component of the system , provided it is described by a relatively low number of effective degrees of freedom , as here , we can exploit the mediocre analogues ( i.e. the @xmath14-analogues with @xmath201 ) .",
    "moreover , with reference to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lyap ] ) , it is reasonable to expect that the prediction error related to mediocre analogues grows as @xmath204 where @xmath205 can be much smaller than the lyapunov exponent @xmath34 ( indeed as shown in ref .",
    "@xmath206 ) .",
    "this implies that slow variables can be predicted over longer term than the whole state of the system , as already realized by lorenz.@xcite in general multiscale systems , increasing @xmath14 amounts to perform a coarse - graining on the system description , which implies the `` elimination '' of the fastest degrees of freedom , associated to the smallest scales .",
    "consequently , coarse - graining reduces the number of effective degrees of freedom ( @xmath207 ) and the error growth rate ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "the previous example is somehow the simplest multiscale system , i.e. @xmath209 vs @xmath14 shows only two logarithmic slopes , @xmath210 and @xmath78 .",
    "more generally one can have a logarithmic slope @xmath211 with a series of plateaux : @xmath212 for @xmath213 $ ] , @xmath214 for @xmath215 $ ] , and so on ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "the interested reader may reproduce such a behavior by computing the correlation integral of the discrete - time system discussed in ref .  .",
    "tidal prediction is a problem of obvious importance for navigation .",
    "the appropriate governing equations had been established since long time by laplace : it is necessary to study the water level , with suitable boundary conditions , under the gravitational forcing of the moon , the sun and the earth.@xcite due to the practical difficulties in the treatment of boundary conditions ( only partially known and hard to solve numerically ) , even with powerful computers the fundamental equations can not be directly used for tide forecasting .",
    "however , and remarkably , already in the first half of the 19-th century there existed efficient empirical methods to compile numerical tables of tides in any location where a record of past tides were known.@xcite as recognized by laplace , a great simplification comes from the periodicity of the forcing ( related to the motions of celestial bodies ) that naturally suggests to treat tides in terms of fourier series , whose frequencies are known from celestial mechanics .",
    "lord kelvin and george darwin ( charles son ) showed that water levels can be well predicted by a limited number of harmonics ( say @xmath217 or @xmath218 ) , determining the fourier coefficients from the past time data at the location of interest . to make the numerical computations automatic minimizing the possibility of error ,",
    "kelvin and darwin built a tide - predicting machine : a special - purpose mechanical computer made of gears and pulleys .",
    "tide - predicting machines have been working till half century ago , when they were replaced by digital computers to compute the fourier series.@xcite    since tides are chaotic , it is natural to wonder why their prediction from past records is a relatively easy task .",
    "one realizes that the reason of such a favorable circumstance is the low number of effective degrees of freedom involved . in a detailed description of tides",
    "also small scale phenomena are involved , with very short characteristic times , _",
    "e.g. _ micro - turbulence ; therefore the `` true '' @xmath78 is surely very large , together with @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the success of tidal prediction is mainly a consequence of the multiscale character of the system , that has a small @xmath219 ( and also a small @xmath205 ) on the interesting not too small scales , in a way similar to the multiscale model of the previous subsection . indeed ,",
    "quite recently , investigations@xcite of tidal time series by using the standard method of nonlinear time series analysis ( such as embedding etc , see sect .",
    "[ sec : embedding ] ) found effective attractor dimensions quite low ( between @xmath220 and @xmath221 ) with effective lyapunov exponents of the order of @xmath222 days@xmath223 .",
    "that explains a posteriori the success of the empirical method .",
    "thanks to the low @xmath219 , analogues can be found .",
    "moreover , to forecast tides a few hours in advance , the relatively low value of the lyapunov exponent makes the predictability time long enough for practical purposes . of course",
    ", quantitative details ( the precise values of @xmath219 and of @xmath224 ) depend on the locations,@xcite but for the method to work , the very important aspect is the limited value of the effective attractor dimension .",
    "it is a common belief that chaos is the main limiting factor to predictability in deterministic systems .",
    "this is correct as long as the evolution laws of the system under consideration are known .",
    "conversely , if the information on the system evolution is only based on observational data , the bottleneck lies in poincar recurrences which , in turn , depend on the number of effective degrees of freedom involved . indeed , even in the most optimistic conditions , if the state vector of the system would be known with arbitrary precision , the amount of data necessary to make the predictions meaningful would grow exponentially with the effective number of degrees of freedom , independently of the presence of chaos .",
    "when , as for tidal predictions , the number of degrees of freedom associated with the scales of interest is relatively small , future can be successfully predicted from past history .",
    "we stress that , the necessity of an exponentially large ( with @xmath78 ) amount of data constitutes a genuine intrinsic difficulty of every analysis based on time series without any guess on the underlying dynamics .",
    "such a difficulty is not a peculiarity of the method of analogues , but is inherent to all methods based on the occurrence frequency of sequences of states to estimate the average of observables . in other words ,",
    "the problem arises whenever one needs to collect enough recurrences .",
    "this obstacle may be partially overcome by suitable information - theoretic techniques ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    "allowing for optimized reconstructions of the dynamics , whose dimensionality , however , increases with the required accuracy .",
    "these conclusions are further supported by a recent work by cubitt and coworkers @xcite , showing that the reconstruction of dynamical equations from data is a computationally np - hard problem , as the needed observation time scales exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom .    in general ,",
    "the best strategy for meaningful prediction is that envisaged by richardson , as a clever compromise between modeling and data analysis . in this regard",
    ", we would like to conclude mentioning that , in the era of information technology , the enormous capacity of data storage , acquisition and elaboration may entitle someone to believe that meaningful predictions can be extracted merely from data .",
    "for example , recently the magazine wired provocatively titled an article `` the end of theory : the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete'',@xcite asserting that nowadays , with the availability of massive data , the traditional way science progresses by hypothesizing , modeling , and testing is becoming obsolete . in this respect , we believe that , while it is undeniable that the enormous amount of data poses new challenges , the role of modeling can not be undermined .",
    "when the number of effective degrees of freedom underlying a dynamical process is even moderately large , predictions based solely on observational data soon become problematic as it happens in weather forecasting .",
