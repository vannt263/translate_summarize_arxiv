    "the solutions derived separately for @xmath135 and the special case @xmath136 automatically satisfy the consistency conditions ( [ eq : consistency1 ] ) and ( [ eq : consistency2 ] ) by construction ; 2 .   in the limit of zero magnetic field , the expressions derived in  [ sec : bx0 ] reduce to those found in paper i ; 3 .   in the classical limit",
    ", our derivation does not coincide with the approximate riemann solvers constructed by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy stems from the fact that both @xcite and @xcite assume that transverse momenta and velocities are tied by the relation @xmath137 .",
    "although certainly true in the exact solution , this assumption reduces , in the hllc approximate formalism , the number of unknowns from @xmath90 to @xmath125 ( when @xmath133 ) thus leaving the systems of jump conditions ( [ eq : jump_1 ] ) overdetermined .",
    "should this be the case , the number of equations exceeds the number of unknowns and the integral relations across the riemann fan inevitably break down .",
    "this explains the inconsistencies found in li s and gurski s derivations and further discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ therefore , in the classical limit , our expressions automatically imply @xmath138 and the correct expressions for the transverse velocities are still given by ( [ eq : transv_v ] ) , whereas transverse momenta should be derived from the jump conditions accordingly .",
    "furthermore , contrary to li s misconception , consistency with the jump conditions requires that the magnetic field components be uniquely determined by ( [ eq : transv_b ] ) and no other choices are thus possible .",
    "the reader might have noticed that in the limit of vanishing @xmath68 , some of the expressions given in  [ sec : bx ] do not reduce to the those found in ",
    "[ sec : bx0 ] .",
    "this property also persists in the classical limit , see @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy relies on the assumption of continuity of the transverse components of magnetic field across the tangential wave @xmath75 : when @xmath139 , a degeneracy occurs where the tangential , alfvn and slow waves all propagate at the speed of the fluid and the solution simplifies to a three - wave pattern . in the exact solution ,",
    "the continuity of @xmath103 and @xmath104 across the tangential wave is lost since the middle state bounded by the two slow waves becomes singular .",

    "this has been done , for example , by @xcite in the context of classical mhd .",
    "the full characteristic decomposition of the rmhd equation ( i.e. the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the jacobian matrix @xmath145 ) was extensively analyzed by @xcite and @xcite . in the one - dimensional case",
    "the jacobian matrix can be decomposed into seven eigenvectors associated with four magnetosonic waves ( fast and slow disturbances ) , two alfvn waves and one entropy wave propagating at the fluid velocity .",
