    "the nonlinearity present in atomic bose - einstein condensates has led to demonstrations of fascinating self - trapped states known as solitons .",
    "these one - dimensional wavepackets , well known in non - linear optics and other fields @xcite , arise when the nonlinearity of the medium counter - acts the effects of dispersion .",
    "they have been realized in several distinct matter - wave forms : bright @xcite , dark @xcite and gap @xcite solitons .",
    "the bright solitons manifest themselves as self - trapped lumps of matter , held together by attractive atomic interactions . in three - dimensions ,",
    "bright matter - wave `` solitons '' are self - trapped in one dimension and require external confinement in the remaining two directions",
    ". we will henceforth refer to these 3d solitonic states as _ bright solitary waves _ ( bsws ) . due to their self - trapping properties ,",
    "matter - wave bsws offer significant possibilities in atom - optical applications such as atom interferometry @xcite and probing the atom - surface interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the three - dimensional nature of bsws leads to the presence of an undesirable collapse instability when the attractive interactions become too strong @xcite .",
    "not only does this affect the static properties of bsws , it can also destabilise their collisions @xcite .",
    "although techniques to suppress collapse effects in attractive becs have been proposed , e.g. , by applying rotation about the _ z_-axis @xcite or by time - modulating the scattering length @xcite , the collapse instability ultimately remains .",
    "a detailed understanding of the properties of matter - wave bsws and their regimes of collapse is therefore essential for the advancement of this field .",
    "the presence of solitonic solutions is revealed by considering the mean - field and zero - temperature limit of atomic becs .",
    "here the bec ` wavefunction ' @xmath1 satisfies a nonlinear wave equation known as the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite , given by , @xmath2\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the atomic mass .",
    "the nonlinear term arises from the short - range atomic interactions , characterised by the _",
    "s_-wave scattering length @xmath4 , and can be repulsive ( @xmath5 ) or attractive ( @xmath6 ) . in 1d and in the absence of an external potential @xmath7 , this has an identical form to the 1d cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation and supports the exact dark and bright soliton solutions derived by zakharov and shabat @xcite .",
    "key properties of these 1d solitons are that they can have any population , their collisions are elastic @xcite and they are stable to thermal dissipation . however , atomic becs are intrinsically 3d objects , typically confined by harmonic traps of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the radial and axial trap frequencies , respectively .",
    "the presence of the extra dimensions modifies the special properties of the 1d soliton by introducing a critical atomic population , inelastic collisions @xcite and thermal dissipation @xcite .",
    "the critical population and inelastic collisions of bsws arise due to the collapse instability which affects attractively - interacting becs in general .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath11 defined as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of atoms in the system and @xmath14 is the radial harmonic oscillator length of the trap . rather than the radial quantity @xmath15 .",
    "] collapse of the system occurs when @xmath11 exceeds a critical value @xmath16 , which is typically of the order of unity .",
    "this implies that there is a critical population @xmath17 beyond which collapse occurs .",
    "note that it is the presence of trapping that leads to a finite value of @xmath17 , whereas a homogeneous , untrapped bec is always unstable to collapse @xcite .    in a recent experiment multiple bsws",
    "were generated in a three - dimensional trap @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the ensuing dynamics were remarkably robust and long - lived .",
    "in this work we analyse the properties of bright solitary matter - waves under external confining potentials with particular emphasis on this experiment @xcite . after reviewing the details of this experiment ( section 2 )",
    ", we employ a variational approach and full solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation to study the ground state and first - excited state solutions of the system ( section 3 ) .",
    "we extend this to additional solitary waves using a dynamical model , revealing the threshold of the collapse instability for up to four solitary waves and compare to experimental measurements .",
    "we then directly simulate the experimental oscillations of two bsws ( section 4 ) and show that a @xmath0-phase difference is essential to support the observed dynamics and gives excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "finally , we present the conclusions of our work ( section 5 ) .",
    "we will review the bsw experiment of cornish _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and its observations .",
    "firstly , a stable @xmath18rb bec was formed with repulsive _ s_-wave interactions .",
    "this typically contained @xmath19 atoms with less than @xmath20 thermal atoms .",
    "the magnetic confining trap was cylindrically symmetric with radial frequency @xmath21hz and is weakly elongated with a trap ratio @xmath22 .",
    "for this system , experimental @xcite and theoretical work @xcite agrees that the critical interaction parameter for collapse is @xmath23 .",
    "following previous experiments @xcite , the _ s_-wave scattering length was then quickly tuned to be attractive by means of a molecular feshbach resonance @xcite . at this point",
    "the number of atoms in the system greatly exceeded the critical number triggering a collapse . during the collapse , three - body atomic losses rise and eventually stabilised the condensate .",
    "the  remnant \" condensate typically contained more than the critical number of atoms , @xmath17 , and was clearly divided in the axial direction into a symmetric arrangement of distinct wavepackets , i.e. bright solitary waves , that oscillated along the weaker axial direction of confining potential maintaining a stationary centre of mass .",
    "note that it is thought that the collapsing condensate fragments into multiple wavepackets via a modulational instability @xcite .",

    "[ fig : experiment ] we present the typical appearance of the condensate column density following the formation of the bsws .",
    "the images were taken when the bsws reached the outer turning points of their oscillatory motion in the harmonic trap and show a cross - section of the optical depth in the axial direction for the case of two and three bsws .",
    "note that the density profiles are approximately symmetric about the origin .",
    "in particular , quantitative measurements of the experimental system were made for fixed scattering length @xmath30 nm and approximately @xmath31 atoms .",
    "since the system initially contained approximately @xmath20 thermal atoms , we will assume the number of condensate atoms to be @xmath32 .",
    "this corresponds to an interaction parameter of @xmath33 which exceeds the critical interaction parameter @xmath16 . despite this , the observed dynamics were surprisingly stable with negligible dissipation over @xmath34  s. for the case of two bsws , the dynamics consist of oscillations in anti - phase along the axial direction of the trap , with the bsws colliding repeatedly at the trap centre .",
    "it is thought that the stable dynamics were supported by the existence of a repulsive @xmath0-phase difference between the bsws , which allowed each bsw to support an atom number corresponding to an interaction parameter just below @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , experimental measurements for up to four bsws showed that the the average value of @xmath11 per bsw never exceeded @xmath16 and this has been recently found to be in good agreement with a theoretical study @xcite .",
    "note that the observed bsw dynamics showed no significant thermal dissipation , despite the presence of the highly energetic burst of atoms ejected from the condensate during the collapse @xcite .",
    "it is likely that these excitations are so `` hot '' ( @xmath35 ) and dilute that thermal equilibrium is not reached over the experimental timescales , with the `` thermal atoms '' remaining effectively invisible to the bsws throughout .",
    "note that the existence of a @xmath0-phase difference has also been inferred in the experiment of strecker _ et al . _",
    "@xcite by the observed repulsive interactions between the bsws .",
    "in 3d and in the presence of interactions there are no exact analytic solutions of the gpe and solutions must be obtained numerically or via approximated approaches . in the latter case ,",
    "variational methods @xcite provide considerable insight without the the need for full numerical solutions . here",
    "we will consider both a variational approach and numerical solution of the gpe .",
    "firstly , we shall study the ground state solutions in the system .",
    "we approximate the ground state solutions ( denoted by the @xmath36-subscript ) by a single - peaked ansatz of the form @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the axial and radial sizes , respectively .",

    "( [ eqn : e_func ] ) we determine the variational energy for the ground state @xmath42 . for convenience",
    "we employ the rescaled parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath14 is the radial harmonic oscillator length .",
    "furthermore , we introduce our interaction parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the ground state ansatz energy then becomes , @xmath47 the first group of terms represents kinetic energy , the second group represents potential energy and the final term represents the energy arising from the _ s_-wave interatomic interactions .",
    "this equation defines an energy landscape for the system in terms of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and variational solutions correspond to local energy minima in this landscape .",
    "we denote the widths of the variational solution by @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the variational method has been employed successfully to study the ground states of the system @xcite . in particular , in the absence of axial trapping @xmath52 , local energy minima arise which correspond to self - trapped bsw solutions . when @xmath11 exceeds a critical value the local energy minimum ceases to exist and the global energy minimum , which occurs at the origin , dominates the system .",
    "this corresponds to collapse .",
    "we have calculated the variational solutions under an axial trap defined by @xmath22 .",
    "the size of the variational solutions as a function of interaction parameter @xmath11 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthscales](a ) . for @xmath53",
    ", the solution corresponds to the exact non - interacting gaussian ground state with @xmath54 . as the attractive interactions grow in size , the solutions , which are always elongated in the @xmath55direction , shrink in both dimensions .",
    "finally , at @xmath56 , the variational solutions disappear and the system is unstable to collapse .    we have also calculated the exact solutions by solving the gpe numerically .",
    "this is performed using the imaginary - time propagation technique : under the substitution @xmath57 in the gpe , the equation evolves to the ground state of the system , providing it exists .",
    "the axial and radial lengthscales of the gpe solutions correspond to the distance over which the density decreases by a factor @xmath58 from its peak value .",

    "furthermore , the gpe solutions become unstable to collapse for @xmath59 .",
    "this is approximately @xmath60 lower than the variational method and arises because the variational method consistently over - estimates the bsw widths and therefore under - estimates the peak density , which is the trigger of collapse .",
    "this result is consistent with previous studies @xcite , where @xmath16 was mapped out for a range of trap ratios .     according to the variational approach of eq .",

    "[ fig : experiment](a ) and @xmath67 m in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment](b ) .",
    "this discrepancy is almost certainly due to the low resolution of the experimental imaging @xcite .      since two ( and more ) bsws were also observed in the jila experiment , and are believed to be supported by a @xmath0-phase difference , it is pertinent to consider the first - excited state of the system ( denoted by @xmath68-subscript ) .",
    "we extend the variational approach by replacing the gaussian axial profile with that of the first - excited harmonic oscillator state , such that the ansatz is , @xmath69 the density profile of this ansatz is double - peaked and can be interpreted as two bsws featuring a @xmath0-phase difference .",

    "these solutions become unstable at @xmath73 .",
    "note that in the absence of axial confinement , there is no stationary first - excited state , because the bsws exert a repulsive force on each other which decays exponentially with their separation .",
    "the lowest energy state is therefore when the bsws are infinitely separated .",
    "according to both the variational ansatz and the full gpe solution , the first - excited state supports an interaction parameter which is almost twice that of the ground state .",
    "note that if the individual bsws were completely independent we would expect the system to support exactly twice @xmath16 of the individual bsws .      in the jila experiment ,",

    "one could extend the variational approach to model any number of bsws by using higher - order excited states of the harmonic oscillator .",

    "states of one and two bsws are obtained by imaginary time propagation as detailed above .",
    "states of three and four bsws can not be formed by imaginary time propagation since the lowest energy state , which is where the atoms populate the central bsws , is unstable to collapse .",
    "a dynamical method is employed @xcite where we begin with a ground state repulsively - interacting bec .",

    "the experimental data is in excellent agreement with these gpe predictions , with every data point showing consistency between theory and experiment .",
    "these results show the importance of @xmath0-phase differences .",
    "furthermore , they show that the experimental system consistently forms a state which is right at the limit of collapse .",
    "this is a remarkable effect , given that the system is initially in a state which is highly unstable to collapse .",
    "the collision of two bsws in a homogeneous waveguide has been considered previously @xcite . during the collision , a high density state forms during the collapse and providing the interaction parameter",
    "is sufficiently large , this can induce collapse .",
    "the collisions are most prone to collapse when ( i ) the bsws are in - phase , since this maximises the overlap and hence the peak density during the collision , and ( ii ) for low speed collisions , since the timescale over which this overlap occurs is large . in contrast , the collapse instability is heavily suppressed when the bsws feature a @xmath0-phase difference or if the impact speed is high , since this reduces the timescale over which a collapse can occur .",
    "furthermore , we have recently shown that when the relative phase @xmath78 between the colliding bsws does not equal zero or @xmath0 , a sizeable population transfer can occur between the bsws @xcite . for @xmath79 ,",
    "this population transfer flows in one direction , while for @xmath80 , it flows in the opposite direction .",
    "while these studies have typically considered single collisions in a homogeneous waveguide , the presence of axial trapping enables multiple collisions .",
    "one - dimensional approaches to bsw collisions in a trap have been made , with a recent study employing a particle model for the bsws @xcite .",
    "below we make a detailed study of the 3d dynamics of two bsws under the conditions of the jila experiment .    in the experiment ,",
    "the axial density profile was measured at regular intervals and each profile was fitted to a single gaussian profile to give the axial full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the experimental data showing the evolution of the fwhm is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : collisions](iii ) .",
    "the key observations are that the fwhm oscillates primarily at @xmath81 and that there is negligible dissipation over @xmath34  s which corresponds to @xmath82 oscillations . as discussed in section [ sec : expt ] , the condensate contains approximately @xmath83 atoms .",
    "we assume each bsw to contain @xmath84 atoms and therefore @xmath85 . at the extreme points of their motion ,",
    "the bsws were observed to be displaced by approximately @xmath86 m from the trap centre .",
    "note this this relatively large separation means that it is more appropriate here to consider the system as a collection of single bsws rather than a true first - excited state of the system .",
    "our initial state therefore consists of two ground state bsws with @xmath87 , positioned at @xmath88 m .",
    "in addition , we also impose a relative phase difference @xmath78 between the initial bsws . typically , the experimental bsw density profile remained symmetric about the trap centre , as illustrated in the experimental profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] .",
    "since only relative phase differences of @xmath36 and @xmath0 ( modulo @xmath89 ) preserve this symmetry in bsw collisions @xcite we will concentrate on these phase differences .",
    "note that the corresponding dynamics for three bsws in a trap appear significantly less stable than the two - bsw state , even with @xmath0-phase differences .",

    "although the bsws start with equal populations in each case , an asymmetry develops over time with one bsw becoming increasingly populated at the expense of the other .",

    "we note that the time at which the system becomes unstable depends upon the initial phase . during each collision ,",
    "the relative phase is also modified and after many collisions this can lead to a reversal of the population transfer .",
    "for example , for @xmath98 , the population difference oscillates slowly before the system ultimately collapses .",
    "since no large asymmetries are observed in the experimental density profiles , this validates our original assumption that the relative phase must of either zero or @xmath0 ( or very close ) .",
    "furthermore , the fact that all cases except @xmath0 become unstable in well under @xmath34  s gives further evidence that a @xmath0-phase difference is crucial to maintain the dynamics of the two bsws observed in the experiment .",
    "in summary , we have performed a detailed analysis of the multiple bright solitary waves ( bsw ) observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we confirm that such multiple bsw states are only stable if there is a @xmath0 phase difference between each bsw .",
    "this allows each bsw to contain approximately the critical number of atoms .",
    "remarkably the experimental data implies that the atom number in each bsw lies consistently just under the threshold for collapse .",
    "we find that two bsws featuring a @xmath0-phase difference undergo stable dynamics in a trap over long times ( of order a few seconds or over 40 collisions ) , in excellent quantitative agreement with experimental measurements .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath36-phase difference , the system undergoes collapse . for intermediate relative phases ( @xmath79 )",
    "we observe significant population transfer between the bsws and a lifetime against collapse that depends upon the value of the relative phase .",
    "we propose that these predictions could be verified by using a phase imprinting technique similar to that used in the creation of dark solitons @xcite to impose a controlled relative phase on the bsws shortly after their creation .",
