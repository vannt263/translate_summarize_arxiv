    "in an accompanying paper @xcite , a general statistical model is proposed to describe scattering of high frequency electromagnetic waves from irregular cavities ( here by high frequency we mean that the wavelength is substantially less than an appropriate characteristic length of the cavity . ) .",
    "this problem arises when one considers the coupling of electromagnetic energy into and out of complicated enclosures .",
    "the statistical approach is warranted when the exact details of the configuration are unknown or are too complicated to simulate accurately .",
    "the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a method for calculating the statistical distributions of important quantities that depend only on a small number of system - specific parameters .",
    "these system - specific parameters are the average spacing between resonant frequencies of the enclosure , the average quality factor , and the properties of the coupling ports .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the key property needed to characterize the coupling port is its radiation impedance , that is , the impedance that would be seen at the port if the other boundaries of the enclosure were perfectly absorbing or were removed to infinity .",
    "this impedance can be used to  normalize \" the fluctuating impedance at the port of the actual enclosure . with this normalization",
    "the fluctuating impedance has a universal ( i.e. , system - specific independent ) distribution .    the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite focused on the case of a single port .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to generalize these results to the case of multiple ports .",
    "a multiple port description is necessary if one is to describe the transmission of energy entering the enclosure to some other point in the enclosure .",
    "we will show that the multiple port case can be treated using the same approach as the single port case .",
    "the main difference being that the multiple port description involves the introduction of matrices describing the coupling to the system .",
    "scattering can be described by either the impedance matrix , which relates voltages and currents at the ports , or by the scattering matrix , which relates the amplitudes of incoming and outgoing waves . in our model",
    "we focus initially on the impedance matrix because its properties can be related directly to the radiation impedances of the ports .",
    "then based on our understanding of the impedance matrix , conclusions about the scattering matrix are drawn .",
    "the statistical treatment of wave scattering in complicated systems has been developed extensively in the physics community in connection with nuclear scattering @xcite and scattering in mesoscopic systems such as quantum dots @xcite and disordered conductors @xcite .",
    "many of the concepts developed in consideration of these problems have also been applied to electromagnetic scattering in microwave cavities @xcite .",
    "the underlying approach is a description of the system based on random matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite . here , the specific systems under consideration are replaced or modelled by random matrices .",
    "these are matrices whose elements are independent gaussian random numbers drawn from specific ensemble distributions .",
    "two different ensembles that are considered are relevant to our problem .",
    "the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) gives rise to a real symmetric matrix , where the variance of the diagonal elements is twice that of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "this applies to wave systems with time reversal symmetry ( trs ) , as would apply in media with real symmetric permittivity and permeability tensors .",
    "the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) gives rise to complex , self - adjoint matrices , where the off - diagonal elements have independent real and imaginary parts .",
    "this applies to wave systems that have time reversal symmetry broken ( trsb ) . for electromagnetic wave systems ,",
    "this case is realized when a nonreciprocal medium such as magnetized ferrite or a magnetized cold plasma is present in the system .",
    "random matrix theory , in spite of its high level of abstraction , has been remarkably successful in predicting the universal statistical properties of wave systems .",
    "this includes the description of the distribution of resonances in closed systems as well as the properties of scattering from open systems .",
    "one issue , that we address here is how to simultaneously account for the universal properties as predicted by rmt and the system - specific properties that depend on details of the coupling . in our approach",
    "this connection is made through the radiation impedance of the ports @xcite ( this connection has also been made by warne et al .",
    "@xcite ) . an alternative approach @xcite in the physics community , known as  the poisson kernel \" ,",
    "is based directly on the scattering matrix .",
    "this approach describes the distribution of fluctuations in the scattering matrix elements in terms of their average values .",
    "recently , kuhl et .",
    "al.@xcite applied the poisson kernel approach to analyse the statistics of measured values of the reflection coefficeint for a microwave cavity .",
    "the measured results were found to be in agreement with predictions based on the poisson kernel .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii generalizes the description of the quasi - two dimensional cavity introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the presence of multiple ports .",
    "our treatment will be sufficiently general so as to treat the case of both isolated ports and non - isolated ports .",
    "we then discuss the changes that must be made when non - reciprocal elements such as a magnetized ferrite are present . in sec .",
    "iii we examine the statistical properties of the proposed impedance matrix , focusing on the two - port case .",
    "we also compare the model predictions with the results of computational electromagnetic calculations using hfss . in section",
    "iv we consider properties of the scattering matrix when the port coupling is imperfect .",
    "we find that the average value of the reflection coefficient is a function of the radiation reflection coefficient . also , we consider the case of multiple ports and verify the equivalence of distributed and diffractive losses in the case of large number of ports .",
    "section v contains a summary of our results . except for section",
    "iv(b ) all our considerations will be in the context of lossless cavities .",
    "following ref.@xcite we consider a quasi - two dimensional cavity in which only the lowest order transverse magnetic modes are excited .",
    "the fields in the cavity are determined by the spatially dependent phasor amplitude of the voltage @xmath0 .",
    "the voltage is excited by currents @xmath1 drives at the various coupling ports , @xmath2 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the height of the cavity and an exponential time dependence @xmath6 has been assumed for all time dependent quantities .",
    "each of the @xmath7 ports is characterized by a profile function @xmath8 centered at different locations and @xmath9 .",
    "the phasor voltage at each port can be calculated as before , @xmath10 and is linearly related to the phasor currents @xmath11 through the impedance matrix , @xmath12 .    to obtain an expression for the matrix @xmath13 , we expand @xmath14 as before @xcite in the basis @xmath15 , the eigenfunctions of the closed cavity .",
    "the result is @xmath16 where the vector @xmath17 is [ @xmath18 , @xmath19, ... ,@xmath20^t$ ] . using the random eigenfunction hypothesis",
    ", we write @xmath15 as a superposition of random plane waves .",
    "thus the elements of the @xmath7-dimensional vector @xmath17 will be gaussian random variables with zero mean .",
    "elements of @xmath17 with different values of @xmath21 corresponding to different eigenfunctions will be independent .",
    "however , for a given eigenfunction the elements of @xmath17 may be correlated .",
    "this will be true , particularly , if two ports are close together , because the random superposition of plane waves leads to an autocorrelation function @xmath22 at two positions separated by @xmath23 @xcite . to treat correlations we write @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a non - random , as yet unspecified",
    ", @xmath26 matrix that depends on the specific coupling geometry at the ports and may depend smoothly on @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is an @xmath7-dimensional gaussian random vector with zero mean and covariance matrix equal to the @xmath26 identity matrix .",
    "that is we require that the components of the random vector @xmath28 are statistically independent of each other , each with unit variance",
    ". correlations between ports are described by the off - diagonal components of @xmath25 .",
    "the idea behind ( [ eq : utow ] ) is that the excitation of the ports by an eigenmode will depend on the port geometry and on the structure of the eigenmode in the vicinity of the ports .",
    "the dependence on the specific port geometry is not sensitive to small changes in the frequency or cavity configuration and is embodied in the matrix quantity @xmath29 .",
    "the structure of the eigenmode in the vicinity of the ports , however , is very sensitive to the frequency and cavity configuration , and this motivates the statistical treatment via the random plane wave hypothesis . from the random plane wave hypothesis , the excitation of the port from a given plane wave component is random , and , since many such waves are superposed , by the central limit theorem , the port excitation is a gaussian random variable , as reflected by the vector @xmath28 . in paper",
    "i , we have derived a result equivalent to ( [ eq : utow ] ) for the case of a one - port with a specific model of the excitation at the port ( namely , a vertical source current density @xmath30 between the plates ) .",
    "our derivation here will be more general in that it does not depend on a specific excitation or on the two - dimensional cavity configuration used in paper i. thus this derivation applies , for example , to three dimensional cavities , and arbitrary port geometries . from ( [ eq : zcav3 ] ) and ( [ eq : utow ] )",
    "we have for the @xmath13 matrix @xmath31    we now take the continuum limit of ( [ eq : zcav4 ] ) and average over @xmath28 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the averaged spacing in @xmath34 values .",
    "we note that the continuum limit is approached as the size of the cavity is made larger and larger , thus making the resonance spacing @xmath35 approach zero .",
    "thus , the continuum limit corresponds to moving the lateral walls of the cavity to infinity . using our previous one - port argument as a guide",
    ", we anticipate that , if the pole in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zaverage ] ) at @xmath36 is interpreted in the causal sense ( corresponding to outgoing waves in the case with the walls removed to infinity ) , then @xmath37 in ( [ eq : zaverage ] ) is the radiation impedance matrix , @xmath38 where @xmath39 with @xmath40 the @xmath7-dimensional vector of port voltages corresponding to the @xmath7-dimensional vector of port currents @xmath41 , in the case where the lateral walls have been removed to infinity . with the above interpretation of the pole , the real part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zaverage ] ) yields @xmath42 thus , eq .  ( [ eq : zcav3 ] ) becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "( note that the formula for @xmath45 is different in two and three dimensions . ) in the case of transmission line inputs that are far apart , e.g. , of the order of the cavity size , then the off - diagonal elements of @xmath46 are small and can be neglected . on the other hand",
    ", this will not be the case if some of the transmission line inputs are separated from each other by a short distance of the order of a wavelength .",
    "similarly , if there is a waveguide input to the cavity where the waveguide has multiple propagating modes , then there will be components of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for each of these modes , and the corresponding off - diagonal elements of @xmath46 for coupling between these modes will not be small .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we will assume identical transmission line inputs that are far enough apart that we may neglect the off - diagonal elements of @xmath46 .",
    "as before , we will take the eigenvalues @xmath34 to have a distribution generated by rmt . because the elements of @xmath13 depend on the eigenvalues @xmath34",
    ", there will be correlations among the elements . in the lossless case",
    "the elements of the @xmath13 matrix are imaginary , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a real symmetric matrix .",
    "consequently @xmath48 has real eigenvalues .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "iii that the distribution for individual eigenvalues of @xmath48 is lorentzian with mean and width determined by the corresponding radiation impedance .      in the time - reversal symmetric system ,",
    "the eigenfunctions of the cavity are real and correspond to superpositions of plane waves with equal amplitude waves propagating in opposite directions as in eq .",
    "( 13 ) of paper @xcite , which is recalled as follows @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are random variables .",
    "if a non - reciprocal element ( such as a magnetized ferrite ) is added to the cavity , then time reversal symmetry is broken ( trsb ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the eigenfunctions become complex .",

    "an interested reader might refer to situations where discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .",

    "( [ eq : zfinal ] ) is now replaced by the conjugate transpose @xmath60 .",
    "a further consequence of trsb is that the distribution of eigenvalues is changed .",
    "the main difference is the behavior of @xmath61 for small @xmath62 . in particular , the probability of small spacings in a trsb system ( @xmath63 ) is less than than of a trs system ( @xmath64 ) .    for the sake of simplicity , we will assume all the transmission lines feeding the cavity ports are identical , and have the same radiation impedance , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are real scalars .",
