    "neutron bombardment reactions create all abundant isotopes of more than 60 elements of the periodic table .",
    "neutron - capture ( @xmath5-capture ) nucleosynthesis can occur slowly in the @xmath6-process , in which @xmath7 decays have time to happen between successive neutron captures , or rapidly in the @xmath4-process , in which enormous , but short - lived , neutron fluxes temporarily overwhelm @xmath7-decay rates .",
    "after completion of an @xmath5-capture event , the final isotopic abundance mix will be very different for the @xmath4- and @xmath6-processes .",
    "detailed exploration of these @xmath5-capture events can best be done with full knowledge of the isotopic abundances in stars over a large metallicity range . at present , this can be done for one star , the sun , through the isotopic analysis of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites .",
    "such analysis reveals a complex mix of @xmath4- and @xmath6-process contributions to solar system @xmath5-capture elements .",
    "meteoritic data can be obtained only for the solar system , so @xmath5-capture contents of other stars must be gleaned from their spectra .",
    "however , the isotopic wavelength shifts for transitions of almost all @xmath5-capture elements are small compared to the thermal+turbulent line widths in stellar spectra .",
    "thus isotopic abundance information is usually inaccessible , and confrontation of @xmath5-capture predictions can only be done with total elemental abundances . in the most metal - poor stars ,",
    "these abundances are very different than their total ( @xmath6- plus @xmath4-process ) solar system values .    neglecting the cases of anomalously carbon - rich stars , abundances of @xmath5-capture elements with z  @xmath3 56 in extremely metal - poor stars",
    "are consistent only with the @xmath4-process component abundances in solar - system material ( e.g. mcwilliam 1997 ; burris et  al .",
    "2000 ; sneden et  al . 2000 ; westin et  al 2000 ; cayrel et  al .",
    "this agreement suggests that even though the @xmath4-process is a very violent dynamical event that can not be reproduced in the laboratory , and is very difficult to model theoretically , nature may be constrained to produce @xmath4-process abundances in basically one fashion .",
    "but the case could be strengthened if the elemental abundances could be deconvolved into isotopic fractions . in this _",
    "letter _ we report a step in this direction , by demonstrating that abundance fractions of europium s two stable isotopes are essentially equal in three @xmath5-capture - rich halo stars , just as they are in the solar system .",
    "we consider three very metal - poor , but relatively @xmath5-capture - rich , giant stars for which high - resolution ( r  @xmath8  @xmath9  = 45,00060,000 ) , high signal - to - noise ( s / n  @xmath10 100 in the wavelength regions of interest ) spectra have been employed in separate chemical composition analyses .",
    "the stars are : ( a ) cs  22892 - 052 ( keck  i data , r  @xmath1 45,000 ; [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 3.1 and [ eu / fe ]  @xmath1 + 1.6 , sneden et  al .",

    "we adopted the model atmosphere parameters and elemental abundances determined in these studies , which the reader should consult for detailed discussion of spectrum acquisition , data reduction , and overall abundance analysis .    in cool giant stars , europium exists almost exclusively in the species .",
    "about a half - dozen spectroscopically accessible strong transitions from low - lying excitation states of this ion can be studied .",
    "the energy levels have substantial hyperfine substructure , and the isotopic energy level shifts between stable isotopes @xmath0eu and @xmath2eu are also large , creating complex and broad absorption features .",
    "the ground - state configuration of is 4@xmath11(@xmath12s)6@xmath6 , from which arise all of the strong blue - violet transitions that can be detected in stellar spectra .",
    "the unpaired 6@xmath6 electron of this configuration produces large magnetic hyperfine splitting , making the blue - uv lines intrinsically broad .",
    "the 6@xmath6 electron also produces the large isotope shift .",
    "the isotope shift is primarily a field shift due to the finite , and different , size of the two eu nuclei .",
    "accurate new laboratory @xmath13 , hyperfine structure , and isotopic shift data for have been determined by lawler , bonvallet , & sneden ( 2001 ) . in their application of these data to the solar spectrum , lawler et  al .",
    "used synthetic spectrum computations to demonstrate ( following the early work of hauge 1972 ) that the eu abundance fractions are essentially equal : fr(@xmath0eu )  @xmath1 fr(@xmath2eu )  @xmath1 0.5 , in good ( and expected ) agreement with the meteoritic values recommended by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) : fr(@xmath0eu )  = 0.478 , fr(@xmath2eu )  = 0.522 .",
    "we adopted without change the line lists of lawler et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which include not only the hyperfine / isotopic components , but other atomic and molecular lines in small spectral regions surrounding the eu lines of interest .",
    "initial synthetic spectrum computations showed that the lines at 3819.67 , 3907.11 , 4129.72 , and 4205.04    have the best combination of large isotopic splitting and relative freedom from contamination from other spectral absorption features .",
    "then for each of these lines in each program star , we iteratively determined the best eu isotopic fractions in the following manner .",
    "first , the line profiles over the whole synthesized wavelength region were used to determine the optimum spectral smoothing ( a combination of spectrograph resolution and so - called stellar macroturbulent broadening ) .",
    "next , as a trial we assumed that the meteoritic eu isotopic fractions were correct , and determined the best eu elemental abundance for the line ( which always turned out to be within @xmath140.03  dex of the mean eu abundance for the star ) .",
    "finally , the elemental abundance was fixed and the observed line profile was compared to synthetic profiles with different assumed isotopic fractions .",
    "this procedure was repeated until the spectral line shape was reproduced satisfactorily .    as one check of the isotopic fractions derived in this manner",
    ", we also determined the best overall synthetic / observed spectrum matches with simultaneous variations in elemental and isotopic abundances in producing the minimum residuals in the spectrum fits .",
    "however , the derived isotopic fractions proved to be essentially the same as those determined in the simpler procedure described in the previous paragraph .    in figure  [ spec4205 ]",
    "we present synthetic and observed spectra of the 4205.04    line in each of the three program stars . in the top panel of this figure we have also marked vertical lines to indicate the wavelengths and relative strengths of the @xmath0eu and @xmath0eu subcomponents for the features . in figure  [ specbd17 ]",
    "the synthetic and observed spectra of 17  are shown for the other three lines that we employed in isotopic abundance derivations . in each panel of this figure the transition subcomponents are marked with vertical lines in the manner of figure  [ spec4205 ] .",
    "inspection of these component distributions reveals that the hyperfine pattern for @xmath0eu is much broader than that of @xmath2eu , in addition to being displaced blueward on average .",
    "these circumstances considerably aid the derivation of isotopic fractions .",
    "it is apparent from the line profiles shown in these figures that the assumption either of @xmath0eu or @xmath2eu dominance in the isotopic mix will not work , and in fact the observed profiles seem best matched by fr(@xmath0eu )  @xmath1 fr(@xmath2eu )  @xmath1 0.5 , just as in the solar photospheric spectrum .    to obtain a more quantitative assessment of the isotopic fractions ,",
    "we computed goodness - of - fit parameters @xmath15 for the observed 4205    line profiles under different isotopic fraction assumptions . here",
    "an @xmath16 deviation has been computed at each of the observed spectrum points ( refer back to the filled circles displayed in figure  [ spec4205 ] ) as the observed spectrum depth @xmath17 the computed depth .",
    "these mean deviations between observed and synthetic spectra are plotted in figure  [ stats ] , and they confirm the visual impressions from figures  [ spec4205 ] and  [ specbd17 ] .",
    "the analyses of each of the four lines in the three program stars yield essentially identical results , hence we suggest that in very - metal - poor @xmath4-process - enhanced stars of the galactic halo , fr(@xmath0eu )  = fr(@xmath2eu )  = 0.5  @xmath14  0.1 . in short ,",
    "we discern no deviation from the eu isotopic mix in the solar system .",
    "both europium isotopes , @xmath0eu  and @xmath2eu . are produced primarily by the _",
    "r_-process in solar system material ( see kppeler et al . 1989 ) , and thus this element has only a very small _ s_-process contribution ( burris et  al .",

    "it can not be simultaneously argued that the europium abundances in our stars have significant @xmath6-process components while their ba / eu and la / eu elemental abundance ratios are more than an order of magnitude smaller than in the solar system or in @xmath6-process predictions .",
