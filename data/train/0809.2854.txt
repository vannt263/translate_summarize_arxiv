    "exactly solvable quantum hyperbolic pschl - teller system @xcite@xcite finds diverse applications in a variety of physical problems .",
    "it appears , for instance , in the form of a stability equation for soliton ( kink ) solutions in 1 + 1-dimensional @xmath1 and sine - gordon field theories @xcite .",
    "it describes static solutions in the gross - neveu model @xcite , and was used in investigation of the tachyon condensation phenomenon in gauge field string dynamics @xcite .",
    "this system , on the other hand , plays a fundamental role in the inverse scattering problem method for nonlinear evolution equations @xcite .",
    "all the mentioned applications are related to a peculiar property of the pschl - teller system , whose potential @xmath2 becomes reflectionless at special values @xmath3 , @xmath4 , of the coupling constant .",
    "this property finds a simple explanation in terms of almost isospectral transformations underlying supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "namely , the reflectionless pschl - teller ( rpt ) system with @xmath3 can be related to a free particle model ( @xmath5 ) by a crum - darboux transformation of order @xmath6 .",
    "the rpt system possesses also a shape - invariance property , due to which the energies of its @xmath6 bound states are found algebraically @xcite .",
    "the rpt system with @xmath6 bound states is characterized by an integral of motion that is a differential operator of order @xmath7 .",
    "this operator is known as a nontrivial operator of the lax pair of a non - periodic problem for the @xmath6-th order korteweg - de vries equation @xcite .",
    "it was rediscovered recently in the context of nonlinear supersymmetric structure associated with the rpt system , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it was observed in @xcite that the rpt system is characterized by a hidden bosonized nonlinear @xmath8 supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial lax operator plays the role of one of its two supercharges , and the parity ( reflection ) operator @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is identified as the @xmath11-grading operator @xmath12 . as a consequence , the extended system composed from the two rpt systems with parameters",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath13 ( including the case @xmath14 that corresponds to a free particle system ) , is described by a nonlinear tri - supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the tri - supersymmetric structure admits three alternative choices of the grading operator , @xmath15 @xmath9 , or @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a diagonal pauli matrix @xcite . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the local part of this unusual supersymmetric structure corresponds to a nonlinear @xmath19 supersymmetry , in which the higher order integral associated with the nontrivial lax operator plays the role of a bosonic central charge @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we show that the hidden bosonized nonlinear supersymmetry of the rpt system and the related nonlinear tri - supersymmetric structure of the extended case originate from a quantum problem of a charged non - relativistic particle on the ads@xmath0 surface in the presence of a singular magnetic - like vortex .",

    "the system reveals a reflectionless quantum dynamics in this case .",
    "these two related properties underlie the peculiar nonlinear supersymmetric structure of the rpt system obtainable by an appropriate angular momentum reduction . at the same time for a generic magnetic flux value , the aharonov - bohm effect on the ads@xmath0",
    "provides a new vision on the nature of the crum - darboux transformations for the quantum hyperbolic pschl - teller system in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "we also discuss this aspect in the background of non - relativistic ads / cft .",
    "the latter is based on non - relativistic conformal symmetry @xcite@xcite , and became recently a hot topic due to the diverse range of applications , see @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize briefly the results on the nonlinear hidden bosonized supersymmetric structure of the rpt system and the tri - supersymmetric structure of the pair of such systems in the light of the crum - darboux transformations , discussed in detail in @xcite . in section 3",
    "we investigate the classical and quantum theory of a non - relativistic particle on the ads@xmath0 , minimally coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field given by the aharonov - bohm vector potential . in section 4",
    "we show how the nonlinear supersymmetric structure of the rpt system emerges from such a non - relativistic system at half - integer values of the magnetic flux . in section 5",
    "we discuss a realization of the conformal and super - conformal dynamical symmetries in the rpt system .",

    "<S> we explain the origin and the nature of a special nonlinear supersymmetry of a reflectionless pschl - teller system by the aharonov - bohm effect for a nonrelativistic particle on the ads@xmath0 . a key role in the supersymmetric structure appearing after reduction by a compact generator of the ads@xmath0 isometry is shown to be played by the discrete symmetries related to the space and time reflections in the ambient minkowski space . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that a correspondence between the two quantum non - relativistic systems is somewhat of the ads / cft holography nature . </S>"
