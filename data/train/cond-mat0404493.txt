    "path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) has become in the last decade a standard tool for studying quantum liquids and solids at finite temperature.@xcite the pimc method allows for the calculation of the quantum - statistical partition function , and from it , thermodynamic functions like the internal energy or the specific heat .",
    "the basis on which pimc rests is the analytical continuation to imaginary time of feynman s path - integral formalism of quantum mechanics.@xcite the resulting convolutive property for the thermal density matrix makes accessible the quantum physics of low temperatures starting from density matrices at higher temperatures . at sufficiently high temperature",
    ", commutator terms between the kinetic and potential operators defining the hamiltonian of the system can be disregarded , and then , the density matrix factorizes as a product of the kinetic and potential parts .",
    "this is known as the primitive approximation ( pa ) and the unbiased convergence to a desired lower temperature by increasing the number @xmath0 of convolutive terms is guaranteed by the trotter formula.@xcite    the expectation value of an operator through the thermal density matrix is written in this language as a multidimensional integral appropriate for a monte carlo interpretation .",
    "the quantum problem can be mapped to a classical one of interacting polymers , each one representing an atom.@xcite in the action , beads of different atoms but with the same index interact through the potential , and all the beads of the same atom form a closed chain of springs . at the level of the pa and avoiding the specific quantum statistics of the atoms or molecules , relevant at temperatures near the absolute zero",
    ", the pimc method looks rather simple .",
    "however , in the implementation of the algorithm there are technical aspects which require of some additional effort .",
    "the main point is that , as the number of beads of the polymeric chains increases rapidly with decreasing temperature , the sampling of the probability distribution function becomes almost impossible by means of individual movements .",
    "several mechanisms for performing smart collective movements of the beads have been proposed and proved to be able of eliminating the slowing down present in the single - bead schemes .",
    "worth mentioning are the staging@xcite and bisection@xcite which exploit the fact that the free action ( kinetic part in an interacting system ) can be sampled by non - rejection methods , and therefore , only the potential part requires a metropolis step . in a large number of pimc simulations ,",
    "these collective sampling schemes are enough to reach a reasonable degree of efficiency .",
    "nevertheless , calculations of quantum fluids at extremely low temperature require chains composed by several thousands of beads , feature which makes the problem more involved .",
    "the number of beads required to achieve the asymptotic regime , at a given temperature , depends on the approximation taken for the action .",
    "it has been proved that pa is accurate to order @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the inverse temperature and @xmath0 the number of beads.@xcite focusing the analysis on pimc , and thus not considering the specific developments for the fourier pimc method,@xcite the improvement of the action can be pursued following at least two different alternatives . in the first one , the pa is substituted by the pair - product action in which the basic step on the chain is constructed as the exact action for two isolated atoms.@xcite this method is more efficient than the pa , mainly when dealing with hard - sphere - like systems , and it is the only method up to date which has proved to be accurate enough to reach the superfluid regime of liquid @xmath3he.@xcite the second possibility relies on the inclusion in the action of the lowest - order corrections to the primitive approximation for the exponential of the hamiltonian @xmath4 . to this end , takahashi and imada@xcite and later on , and independently , li and broughton@xcite found a manageable expression for the trace accurate to order @xmath5 . in this approximation , hereafter referred as tia , the beads of different atoms interact through an effective potential which is the sum of the interatomic potential and a @xmath2-dependent term containing the double commutator @xmath6,v]$ ] , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 the potential and kinetic operators , respectively .",
    "recently , jang _ _ et al.__@xcite have used in pimc a genuine fourth - order factorization according to the proposal of suzuki@xcite and the posterior developments of chin.@xcite however , the accuracy achieved in several test problems by jang _ _ et al.__@xcite is comparable to the one reached using the simpler tia .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the @xmath9 dependence of the energy using both pa and tia for a test model and for two strongly interacting fluids at low temperature , i.e. , ne and @xmath3he . in the analysis of the pa results ,",
    "we introduce the richardson extrapolation.@xcite the efficiency of this numerical scheme for extrapolation is well known in fields like integration or solution of differential equations .",
    "we show that its use in pimc can also be useful in two directions .",
    "first , its simple use helps in determining when the expected law @xmath1 is reached ; second , the successive extrapolations to @xmath10 follow a nearly fourth - order dependence and then they always approach faster to the asymptote than the pa .",
    "the second main objective of the work is the study of the tia when applied to hard - core interacting systems in the regime of low temperatures since the applications of tia to these situations is rather scarce.@xcite previous tests of the tia to systems not so dense and not so cold have shown the expected fourth - order accuracy.@xcite in fact , the achievement of a fourth - order law for hard - core potentials using tia has been some times questioned@xcite but never thoroughly analyzed .",
    "our present results show that in the regime studied the accuracy obtained is the expected one and the global efficiency of tia is larger than the one of the standard pa . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of the richardson extrapolation on top of the tia results has proved not to be so helpful , at least in the temperatures where the two real systems have been studied .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows :",
    "section ii contains the formalism of the pa and the tia , including the expressions for the thermodynamic and centroid - virial estimators for the energy .",
    "the application of the richardson extrapolation to the pimc calculations is also discussed . in sec .",
    "iii , results for the three systems under study are presented with special emphasis to the @xmath11 dependence of the energy obtained using the two models for the action .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv comprises a brief summary and the main conclusions of the work .",
    "the partition function of a system described by a hamiltonian @xmath12 at a temperature @xmath13 is @xmath14 we consider a system composed by @xmath15 particles with @xmath16 , the kinetic operator being @xmath17 and the potential one @xmath18 where pairwise interactions are assumed .",
    "the pa is the lowest order term in powers of @xmath11 of the exponential of the sum of the two operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 in fact , in the limit where @xmath10 the previous expression becomes exact , yielding the trotter formula . with the decomposition",
    "( [ splitpa ] ) , and restricting the analysis to distinguishable particles , the partition function becomes @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "greek and latin indexes are used throughout the paper to denote beads and particles , respectively .",
    "the primitive factorization ( [ splitpa ] ) , which decouples the kinetic and potential operators , leads to the well - known pa , @xmath25    takahashi and imada@xcite proved that it is possible to extend the accuracy of the action up to fourth order for the trace by substituting in eq .",
    "( [ splitpa ] ) the operator @xmath20 by another one @xmath26 given by @xmath27 the second term on the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ potti1 ] ) corresponds to the double commutator @xmath6,v]$ ] appearing in the development of the exponential @xmath28 .",
    "the classical - like force @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 therefore , the partition function using the tia is written like the pa one ( [ zpa1 ] ) just substituting the interatomic potential @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ zpa2 ] ) by @xmath32 , @xmath33    first derivatives of the partition function allow for the estimation of the total and partial energies of the @xmath15-body system,@xcite @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the potential energy , and any other coordinate operators , can also be obtained through the general relation@xcite @xmath36 equation ( [ kinener ] ) leads to the thermodynamic estimators for the kinetic energy . at the level of pa , @xmath37 in the case of the tia",
    "the effective potential @xmath38 depends on the mass of the particles and the temperature .",
    "therefore , explicit terms depending on the interatomic potential appear in the estimation of the kinetic energy .",
    "explicitly , @xmath39 the potential energy in the pa case corresponds to a direct estimation of @xmath40 , @xmath41 whereas the application of eq .",
    "( [ nice ] ) for the tia produces the same additional force term of eq .",
    "( [ thermotia ] ) , multiplied by a factor of two , @xmath42    the unbiased convergence of both the pa and tia factorizations to the exact energy when @xmath0 increases is granted by the trotter formula.@xcite however , the thermodynamic estimator for both approaches ( [ thermopa],[thermotia ] ) presents the drawback of a statistical variance which increases with the number of beads @xmath0.@xcite to overcome this problem one can derive another estimator for the energy by exploiting the invariance of the partition function under a rescaling of the particle positions ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this leads to the so called virial estimator@xcite in which the kinetic energy is obtained from derivatives of the interatomic potential @xmath40 .",
    "it has been proved that , contrary to the thermodynamic estimator , the variance of the virial estimator is roughly constant as a function of @xmath0.@xcite we have chosen in the present work the centroid version of the virial estimator . in the pa , @xmath44 with @xmath45 the centroid position of atom @xmath46 . by applying the same method to the tia , two new terms appear requiring up to the second derivative of @xmath40 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 stand for the cartesian coordinates and an implicit summation over repeated indices has been assumed .",
    "the tensor @xmath49 is explicitly written as @xmath50 \\frac{d v(r_{\\alpha , ij})}{d r_{\\alpha , ij } } +   \\frac{(r_{\\alpha , ij})^b ( r_{\\alpha , ij})_a } { r_{\\alpha , ij}^2 } \\ , \\frac{d^2 v(r_{\\alpha , ij})}{d r_{\\alpha , ij}^2 } \\ . \\label{tensortia}\\ ] ]    the pimc method is the most efficient theoretical tool to deal with a microscopic description of systems at low temperatures where quantum effects are unavoidable . with the only external assumption of the interatomic potentials , pimc provides exact results at a given temperature with a self - contained adjustment of the number of terms ( beads @xmath0 ) in the action to the _ quanticity _ of the system : from @xmath51 , which corresponds to classical monte carlo (",
    "each particle is a point in the configuration space ) , to values of @xmath0 ( each particle is represented by a closed chain of beads ) larger enough to fulfill the trotter formula.@xcite it is hence essential to remove from the calculation the bias coming from the use of a discrete value for @xmath0 , or at least to reduce it to the level of the typical statistical error . in order to help in this analysis",
    "we have used the well - known richardson extrapolation;@xcite its use in numerical integration , derivation or differential equations permits to achieve high accuracy by using low - order formulas .    the @xmath0-dependence of integrated quantities like the energy for the pa and tia , when @xmath10 , is of the form @xmath52 with @xmath53 for pa and tia , respectively .",
    "the value @xmath54 in pimc plays the same role than the step size @xmath55 in a numerical integration and in both cases one is interested in the extrapolation to the _ ideal _ case @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "richardson extrapolation is a simple and clever way of performing that extrapolation improving the order of the approach . in the present case , the extrapolation to @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 being the energies estimated using @xmath62 and @xmath63 beads , respectively ( @xmath64 ) . when the calculation proceeds , and @xmath0",
    "is progressively increased it is also useful to know how far one is from the asymptotic law ( [ asympt ] ) . in this respect ,",
    "the richardson extrapolation can also be used to predict the energy for a number of beads @xmath65 through @xmath66",
    "the usefulness of the richardson extrapolation on top of the pimc calculations and the accuracy of the tia with respect to the pa have been studied in three different systems .",
    "the first one corresponds to the test problem of a particle in a one - dimensional harmonic potential in which the exact solution is known . in the second one",
    ", we study liquid ne at 25.8 k , a real system at relatively high density and where the interatomic interaction presents a hard core at short distances .",
    "finally , the most exigent test in the present analysis corresponds to the calculation of the energy of liquid @xmath3he at 5.1 k in which the low temperature , the small mass , and the hard core of the interactions make the quantum effects much larger .",
    "the sampling of the three systems studied has been carried out by combining collective movements of some beads of a given chain and movements of the center of mass of each one of the chains representing the atoms . in both movements the size of the proposed movements is fixed to keep a metropolis acceptance of 30 - 50% .",
    "as it has been proved , the introduction of multibead movements is unavoidable when the number of beads increases since they eliminate the slowing down observed in a bead by bead sampling . to this end",
    ", we have used the bisection@xcite and staging@xcite methods : the bisection up to level three for short chains and staging for longer ones .",
    "both methods correspond to an exact sampling of the free ( kinetic ) part of the action and therefore , in the metropolis step , only the potential part of the action is sampled .",

    "table [ heliumbisecpp ] contains results for the total and partial energies for an increasing number of beads @xmath0 .",
    "the essentially quantum nature of @xmath3he is reflected in the high value of its kinetic energy , comparable to the potential energy .",
    "the quantum correction on top of the classical value is @xmath78 k , to be compared with a total value of 19.0 k. regarding the behavior of the pa and tia energies with @xmath0 , one can observe a similar behavior to the one obtained for ne in the previous subsection .",
    "the asymptotic value using pa is reached for @xmath79 whereas @xmath80 for the tia ; the accuracy is then improved by a factor of four .",
    "considering altogether , the reduction in the number of beads and the additional computation required for the tia , the efficiency of the tia is still greater than the one of the pa .",
    "richardson extrapolations using the pimc results for the total energies are reported in table [ richardsonextrapolationhe ] .",
    "the main features are common to the ones observed in ne .",
    "the use of richardson extrapolation always improves the direct calculation with zero computational cost and it arrives faster to the asymptote . from the results contained in the table , one can see that the right energy using pa is obtained with data up to @xmath81 , a factor of two smaller than the direct pa calculation . in the case of the tia ,",
    "the extrapolation is also better than the direct output but it does not significantly improve the efficiency in achieving the plateau .",
    "figure [ enerhelium5 - 2 ] is a plot of the total and partial energies as a function of @xmath54 near the region where the power laws ( [ asymtresh ] ) are satisfied .",
    "as it can be seen , the tia data approaches the limit according to a fourth - order law , a point that sometimes has been questioned for hard - core - like interactions at very low temperatures .",
    "the richardson extrapolations make a good job for both the total and partial energies by improving significantly the @xmath54 dependence of the pa data .",
    "an unbiased estimation of the energies is drawn from the numerical fits ( [ asymtresh ] ) with @xmath82 for pa and 4 for tia . using pa , @xmath83 k , @xmath84 k , and @xmath85 k. with the tia , @xmath86 k , @xmath87 k , and @xmath88 k. at the same thermodynamic point ,",
    "ceperley and pollock@xcite reported a total energy of -2.61 k and a kinetic energy of 18.09 k , but using a different interatomic potential .",
    "in the present work we have explored two possible strategies for improving the number - of - beads - dependence of the pimc algorithm , specially for exigent problems in which the use of pa may require a very large number @xmath0 .",
    "first , the usefulness of the richardson extrapolation on top of the pa data has been analyzed for the first time .",
    "richardson extrapolation is a clever way of practically improving the order of the errors introduced by discretization and its use in numerical algorithms like integration or solution of differential equations is widely known .",
    "also in pimc a discretization through an effective step @xmath54 is introduced and one is interested in going to the limit @xmath89 .",
    "the results obtained have proved that also in pimc richardson extrapolation can be useful since it approaches faster to the asymptote and helps to know when the discrete results behave according to the expected power law .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the presence of statistical errors mask somewhat the signal but it is also true that the computational cost of the extrapolation is certainly zero .",
    "the second main focus of the work has been to study the behavior of the tia in systems with hard - core - like interactions and well into the quantum regime .",
    "previous tests of the tia@xcite were performed in less exigent conditions and some doubts concerning the fail of the predicted fourth - order accuracy were formulated .",
    "the present results , mainly the ones achieved in the calculation of @xmath3he , have shown that the fourth order law is maintained . on the other hand , the tia introduces in the calculation additional computation due to the need of the second derivative of the potential ( using the virial estimator for the kinetic energy , absolutely necessary when @xmath0 increases ) .",
    "this is not a serious problem , at least when empirical potentials are used , and the computer time to achieve the same statistical error in the asymptotic limit in @xmath0 is ever reduced .",
    "our present experience shows that the cpu time is at least a 30% smaller , and that this percentage increases with the number of beads required to reach the asymptote .    as a final point",
    ", the fact that the double commutator @xmath6,v]$ ] in the tia has allowed for a substantial decrease of the systematic errors for very different potentials is an encouraging result . at present , chin@xcite is developing various families of symplectic algorithms in which that double commutator originates a fourth - order correction which can be fine - tuned both in sign and magnitude .",
    "this bears the promise of achieving an effective cancellation of the leading fourth and sixth order corrections , feature which could result in a dramatic reduction of the computational cost of pimc calculations .",
    "further work in this direction would be most interesting ."
