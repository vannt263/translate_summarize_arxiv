    "<S> this allows us to develop a strategy to determine the lyapunov exponent for extended harper s model , for all values of parameters and all irrational frequencies . in particular , this includes the self - dual regime for which even heuristic results did not previously exist in physics literature . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of avila s global theory is also shown to imply continuous behavior of the le on the space of analytic @xmath0-cocycles . </S>",
