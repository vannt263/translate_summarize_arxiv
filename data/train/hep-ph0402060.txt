    "evidence for the existence of the pentaquark state @xmath2  @xcite is now rather overwhelming . the initial experimental reports about the discovery of @xmath2  @xcite will be followed by a series of dedicated high precision experiments aiming to study such properties of the new baryon as parity , spin and isospin .",
    "hence , it is topical to analyze in which reactions and at which kinematic conditions production of @xmath2 is sufficiently copious and can be reliably estimated by hadronic phenomenology .",
    "an important role in the present and future experimental investigations concerning @xmath2 is played by photoproduction on deuterium . in some cases",
    ", the deuterium target serves as a mere source of the proton and neutron targets and rescattering on the spectator nucleon simply enhances the @xmath2 signal  @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "rescattering on the spectator nucleon is the source of @xmath2 production  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we concern ourselves with the latter class of reactions .",
    "in particular , we consider the strangeness tagging @xmath5 reaction , where the interaction of the photon with one of the nucleons produces a hyperon ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) and a kaon .",
    "one then can choose kinematics where the produced kaon has the correct momentum to produce @xmath2 via the interaction with the other nucleon of the deuteron .",
    "the main advantage of the reaction is that the theoretical analysis is only weakly model - dependent : the differential cross section for the @xmath8 has been measured and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 amplitudes have been phenomenologically parametrized ; the deuteron wave function is known very well for the momentum range involved in the process ; the dynamical information about @xmath4 enters only through the total width of @xmath4 , which can be treated as a free parameter and then determined by the comparison to experiment .",
    "however , since production of @xmath4 takes place through rescattering on the spectator nucleon of deuterium ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] ) , the resulting cross section is suppressed by the nuclear wave function at high momenta ( this suppression is under control ) .",
    "the reaction @xmath5 is described by two feynman graphs presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] .",
    "we neglected the unknown final - state interactions between @xmath11 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to note that the resulting scattering amplitude on deuterium crucially depends on interference between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( elementary ) scattering amplitudes .",
    "this introduces certain model - dependence into our calculations since our results become dependent on the @xmath13 amplitude , for which there is only a phenomenological parameterization and not experimental data .    -3 cm    our numerical analysis of the feynman graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] showed that the scattering amplitude is predominantly imaginary in the considered kinematics .",
    "the imaginary part is found as a sum of all possible cuts of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] .",
    "it is clear that there are three possible cuts .",
    "however , cutting simultaneously the spectator nucleon ( neutron in the left graph and proton in the right graph ) and kaon lines gives the dominant contribution .",
    "this cut places the spectator nucleon and the kaon on mass shell .    after this cut , in the @xmath14 vertex",
    "all particles are on mass shell .",
    "this means that the corresponding expression is a function of the particle masses and the total width of @xmath2 and , hence , it does not depend on the spectator momentum .    the interacting nucleon ( proton in left graph and neutron in the right graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] ) is off mass shell .",
    "an examination of its energy denominator shows that the interacting nucleon is not far from its mass shell and , hence , to a good approximation can be treated as being on mass shell .",
    "then , with a good accuracy , the @xmath15 amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] depends only on the external four - momentum transfer @xmath16 and the photon energy @xmath17 .",
    "details of the derivation of the scattering amplitude and cross sections corresponding to feynman graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] are given in appendix  a. here we give the final expression for the differential cross section for the @xmath18 process @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total width of @xmath2 and @xmath21 gev is its mass ; @xmath22 is the nucleon mass and @xmath23 is the kaon mass .    the factorized form of eq .",

    "we assumed that @xmath2 has spin 1/2 and isospin 0 .",
    "other spin and isospin assignments are considered in the end of this section .",
    "the second factor @xmath24 is the differential cross section , which includes the @xmath25 and @xmath26 amplitudes and their interference .",

    "[ fig : risunok1 ] ( solid curves ) . for comparison",
    ", we also give the @xmath25 differential cross section ( dashed curves ) .",
    "note that the momentum transfer squared from @xmath27 to @xmath6 is defined as @xmath16 .",
    "this means that in fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok1 ] , the minimal @xmath28 ( maximal @xmath29 ) corresponds to the forward scattering kaon in the center of mass frame .",

    "@xmath24 is significantly larger than @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the contribution of @xmath26 significantly enhances the resulting @xmath31 cross section .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok1 ] were obtained using the maid data base and generator  @xcite consistent with the saphir @xmath32 data  @xcite and @xmath33 data  @xcite .",
    "note that the choice of the photon energy @xmath34 and 2 gev is motivated by the constraints of the maid generator , @xmath35 gev .",
    "note also that the cross section for production of @xmath7 is approximately two times larger than that of @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to note that since we took @xmath2 with isospin-0 for this calculation , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 amplitudes as generated by maid enter with a relative plus sign .",
    "the last factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : main1 ] ) describes the @xmath28-dependent suppression by the deuteron wave function due to rescattering on the spectator nucleon ( see appendix  a for details ) .",
    "we used the deuteron wave function with the paris nucleon - nucleon potential  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : risunok2 ] shows @xmath36 as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "note that within our approach , @xmath36 does not depend on energy .",
    "also , since masses of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are rather close , the nuclear factor @xmath36 is the same for @xmath6 and @xmath7 production .",
    "a very strong @xmath28-dependence of @xmath36 suggests that the region @xmath37 gev@xmath38 is most favorable for the experimental studies of the @xmath18 reaction .    the main results of the present paper , the differential cross sections for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 processes , are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : risunok3 ] and [ fig : risunok4 ] .",
    "the differential cross section is calculated at four different photon energies , @xmath34 , 1.6 , 2 and 2.6 gev , which correspond to the kinematics of spring-8 , jlab , saphir and graal experiments ( the photon energy @xmath41 gev is the largest energy at which there are @xmath25 data ) .",
    "one sees that the cross sections are largest for @xmath37 gev@xmath38 : this is the most favorable region of @xmath28 for copious @xmath2 production . in this calculation",
    "we assumed that @xmath42 mev .",
    "as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : main1 ] ) , the discussed cross sections depend linearly on @xmath20 . therefore ,",
    "if one wishes to use a different width of @xmath2 , @xmath43 , the cross section of @xmath2 production should be rescaled by the factor @xmath44 .",
    "one should note that at the moment the total width of @xmath2 is rather uncertain .",
    "theoretical predictions for its values range from less than 15 mev  @xcite to several mev  @xcite .",
    "the experimental determination of the width of @xmath2 is limited by the experimental resolution .",
    "the most stringent constraint is given by the diana collaboration  @xcite , @xmath45 mev .",
    "only two experiments , hermes  @xcite and zeus  @xcite , appear to indicate a finite width of @xmath2 which is somewhat larger than the experimental resolution .",
    "the @xmath18 cross section decreases rather rapidly with increasing photon energy .",
    "this is determined by the decrease of the @xmath8 cross section  @xcite and , more importantly , by the changing @xmath28-dependence of the @xmath8 and @xmath46 differential cross sections . as the photon energy increases , the cross sections are peaked progressively at smaller c.m . scattering angles of the kaon , which translates to intermediate values of @xmath28 in our kinematics , where the suppression due to the nuclear factor @xmath36 is rather significant .",
    "one sees from figs .",
    "[ fig : risunok3 ] and [ fig : risunok4 ] that the photon energy @xmath34 gev gives the largest @xmath2 production cross section ( notice the @xmath47-axis scale change as we increase the photon energy ) .    while for @xmath34 , 1.6 and 2 gev we used the results of maid  @xcite , for @xmath41 gev we directly used the recent saphir experimental data for @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "then we assumed that the @xmath8 and @xmath46 scattering amplitudes are equal .",
    "therefore , our results at @xmath41 gev bear the largest theoretical uncertainty and should be considered as a qualitative upper limit .",
    "this explains the shape of the curves at @xmath41 gev : for instance , the presence of the dip at @xmath48 gev@xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok3 ] originates from the almost zero @xmath49 cross section at @xmath50  @xcite .    integrating the differential cross sections over @xmath28",
    ", we obtain the corresponding total cross sections , which are summarized in table  1 .    .integrated @xmath51 and @xmath52 cross sections at different photon energies @xmath17 the total width of @xmath2",
    "is assumed @xmath42 mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : total ]    one should note that in the considered processes , @xmath6 can be produced either directly in the @xmath53 vertex or in the @xmath54 decay .",
    "hence , a special attention should be payed to distinguish these two ways of producing @xmath6 in the experiment .",
    "also , one can consider other than spin-1/2 and isospin-0 assignments for @xmath2 .",
    "the issue of isospin of @xmath2 constitutes an interesting theoretical question , see for instance  @xcite . if @xmath2 has spin-3/2 , then the final expression for the differential cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) should be twice as large .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that spin-3/2 @xmath2 has twice as many polarization states compared to the spin-1/2 @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 has isospin-1 , this introduces a minus sign between the two feynman graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] .",
    "indeed , in this case isospin invariance indicates that the @xmath55 and @xmath56 vertices have opposite signs ( see appendix  b for details ) . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath51 cross section becomes enhanced , while the @xmath57 cross section is significantly reduced , as compared to the isospin-0 case .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2 isospin-1 differential cross sections at two photon energies , @xmath34 and 1.6 gev , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok6 ] .    figure  [ fig : risunok6 ] ( @xmath58 ) should be compared to figs .",
    "[ fig : risunok4 ] and [ fig : risunok5 ] ( @xmath59 ) . in the former case ,",
    "the @xmath51 cross section is enhanced by approximately factor of two as compared to the @xmath59 case . on the other hand , the @xmath57",
    "cross section becomes reduced by approximately factor of ten as compared to the @xmath59 case .",
    "this result can be explained as follows .",
    "if isospin of @xmath2 is zero , the @xmath51 reaction involves the @xmath60 component of the initial photon , while @xmath52 reaction involves the @xmath61 component of the photon .",
    "an analogy with the vector meson dominance model suggests that the interaction mediated by the @xmath61 component is stronger than by the @xmath60 component , exactly as we observe . on the other hand ,",
    "if isospin of @xmath2 is 1 , the situation is just the opposite and production of @xmath6 is expected to be larger than production of @xmath7 .    a comparison of the @xmath51 and @xmath57 rates can clearly distinguish between the @xmath2 with isospin-0 and isospin-1 scenarios . indeed , while the absolute value of the cross sections is uncertain due to the uncertainty in the total width of @xmath2 as well as due to possible final state interactions",
    ". however , the ratio of the @xmath51 and @xmath57 cross sections ( let us denote it by @xmath62 ) is insensitive to @xmath20 which cancels in the ratio .",
    "in addition , the final state interaction is a correction and , hence , can not change @xmath62 too much .",
    "since the ratio @xmath62 changes from @xmath63 at @xmath64 gev@xmath38 ( if @xmath2 has isospin-0 ) to @xmath65 ( in the isospin-1 case ) , it should be possible to experimentally distinguish between these two cases .    if one assumes that @xmath58 , in addition to the @xmath66 final state , one can consider production of @xmath67 and @xmath68 states .",
    "it follows from isospin conservation that @xmath69 .",
    "however , based solely on isospin conservation , @xmath70 and @xmath71 can not be related to @xmath72 .",
    "we also note that the @xmath2 production mechanism of fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] can not produce @xmath2 with isospin-2 .",
    "the main background reaction @xmath73 is presented in fig .  [ fig : bg ] . since the other background reaction @xmath74 involves the unmeasured @xmath26 amplitude , we shall concentrate on the process in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] .",
    "-3 cm    the background process plays a two - fold role .",
    "first , a detailed examination shows that interference with the signal enhances @xmath2 production ( see appendix  b for details ) .",
    "the differential interference cross section can be cast in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : main1 ] ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the interference cross section obtained using the interference amplitude @xmath77 involving the @xmath25 ( denoted as @xmath78 ) and @xmath26 ( denoted as @xmath79 ) amplitudes .",
    "hence , the signal plus interference cross section takes the following compact form @xmath80 where an additional factor 1/2 in front of the first term is a consequence of the 1/2-branching ratio of the @xmath81 decay .",
    "note that the simple form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bg2 ] ) holds only for the cross sections integrated over the final neutron momentum ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the second aspect of the background process is that it produces the same final state as the signal process but does not carry any information ( unlike the interference term ) about @xmath2 .",
    "hence , we intend to find kinematic conditions where the signal plus interference cross section is larger than the purely background contribution .",
    "it is important to point out that in general , the purely background ( born ) cross section of fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] is much larger than the rescattering cross section of fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] .",
    "the relative magnitude of these cross sections is determined predominantly by the nuclear suppression factor .",
    "while the born amplitude is proportional to @xmath82 with @xmath83 being the final nucleon ( spectator ) momentum , the rescattering amplitude involves @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , one way to suppressed the purely background cross section is to choose relatively large spectator ( neutron in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] ) momenta .",
    "thus , it is important to discuss how different contributions depend on @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath83-dependence of the signal cross section is rather weak and is determined by the neutron - kaon phase space .",
    "the interference term depends on @xmath83 much stronger through @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , the interference term is suppressed by the smallness of the total width of @xmath2 and the loop integral involving the deuteron wave function .",
    "the @xmath83-dependence of the purely background contribution is the strongest : the cross section is proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "however , this suppression is still not sufficient for the reduction of the background to the signal level : one needs to impose an additional constraint on the neutron - kaon invariant mass , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bg ] ) .    the theoretical analysis of the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] is rather straightforward and is detailed in appendix  b. since we aim to estimate the level of background under the @xmath2 resonance peak in the @xmath86-neutron system , we impose the condition that in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] , the invariant mass of the @xmath86-neutron system , @xmath87 , belongs to the interval , for instance , @xmath88 the value of 10 mev is chosen as a realistic example with only one constraint in mind that 10 mev resolution is clearly within the reach of future dedicated experiments on @xmath2 production .",
    "the purely background @xmath73 double differential cross sections corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] at different values of the momentum of the spectator neutron are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok5 ] by dashed curves .",
    "they should be compared to solid curves , which represent the signal plus interference @xmath73 cross section ( see appendix  b for the exact expressions ) .",
    "the interference cross section is given by the dot - dashed curves .",
    "note that interference with the background increases the signal .",
    "all curves correspond to @xmath34 gev , where @xmath2 production is largest .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok5 ] , choosing a sufficiently high spectator momentum , @xmath89 and @xmath90 mev / c and above , significantly reduces the background without changing the position and shape of the resonance peak .",
    "hence , detection of a spectator nucleon ( neutron ) in coincidence with @xmath11 presents a good opportunity to increase the signal to background ratio under the @xmath2 peak in the @xmath2 photoproduction on deuterium .",
    "if experimental resolution in the final neutron - kaon invariant mass is at the level of several mev and luminosity is sufficiently high , one can also study the shape of the @xmath2 production cross section as a function of @xmath91 and clearly separate the signal from the background .",
    "an example is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok7 ] , where we plot the signal plus interference triple differential cross section ( solid curves ) and the purely background triple differential cross section ( dashed curves ) as functions of @xmath92 .",
    "the kinematics is maximally favorable for the signal extraction : @xmath34 gev , @xmath93 gev@xmath38 and @xmath89 mev / c .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok7 ] that the distinctive breit - wigner curve of the signal plus interference ( solid curves ) dominates the flat background distribution ( dashed curves ) .",
    "among a multitude of @xmath2 photoproduction mechanisms , we single out the @xmath94 process as being weakly model - dependent .",
    "the @xmath94 cross section involves the measured @xmath95 and phenomenologically parametrized @xmath96 amplitudes , the well established deuteron wave function and the total width of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath94 process is a very good candidate reaction for a precise measurement of the @xmath2 width .",
    "we studied the @xmath94 differential cross section and found it to be sharply peaked for @xmath37 gev@xmath38 , where @xmath16 .",
    "hence , this kinematic region is most favorable for the experimental studies .",
    "we performed our analysis of the @xmath94 cross section for a range of the photon energies , @xmath3 gev , which almost covers the energy range of spring-8 , tjnaf , saphir and graal experiments .",
    "it is found that @xmath94 cross section is largest at the smallest studied energy , @xmath34 gev .    in order to understand if the extraction of @xmath2 from the @xmath94 data is possible , we estimated the rate of the background reaction @xmath97 .",
    "we showed that the signal to background ratio is large when one chooses sufficiently large momenta of the spectator neutron , @xmath98 mev / c .",
    "in addition , if experimental accuracy in the determination of the final neutron - kaon invariant mass is at the level of several mev , one can also study the @xmath2 photoproduction cross section as a function of that invariant mass .",
    "the shape of the resulting distribution will clearly separate the signal from the background , see fig .",
    "[ fig : risunok7 ] .",
    "our calculations in this paper are based on the assumption that @xmath2 has spin-1/2 and isospin-0 .",
    "if @xmath2 is assigned spin-3/2 , then the signal and interference cross sections are twice as large .",
    "the relative rates of @xmath99 and @xmath100 production are very sensitive to isospin of @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath2 has isospin-0 , production of @xmath7 is approximately twice as large as production of @xmath6 .",
    "however , if we suppose that @xmath2 has isospin-1 , production of @xmath7 is significantly smaller than production of @xmath6 .",
    "another important and yet undetermined characteristics of @xmath2 is its parity .",
    "our prediction for the @xmath94 differential cross section does not depend on the @xmath2 parity since @xmath2 enters into our analysis only through its mass and total width .",
    "overall , it appears that the @xmath94 reaction does not seem to be a good candidate to study parity of @xmath2 . in general",
    ", the @xmath94 amplitude can be parametrized in terms of twelve functions . since the number of unknown functions is rather large , choosing different polarizations of the photon , deuteron and @xmath11 is not sufficient to produce unambiguous and model - independent relations between polarization observables and parity of @xmath2 , as was suggested for the @xmath102 reaction  @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank mark strikman and maxim polyakov for continuing interest and illuminating discussions concerning the @xmath94 reactions .",
    "we also thank kazuo tsushima for the discussion of initial drafts of the present paper , as well as k. goeke and v. metag .",
