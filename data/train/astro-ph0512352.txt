    "photometric surveys for transiting extra - solar planets have become very popular since the detection of the transits exhibited by the planet - host star hd 209458 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for the first time the radius of an extra - solar planet was determined , and the measurement of the orbital inclination lead to an estimate of the planetary mass , not just a lower limit .",
    "the planet hd 209458b was found to have an average density of @xmath00.38 g/@xmath2 , significantly less than the average density of saturn ( 0.7 g/@xmath2 ) , leading to the term `` hot jupiter '' for the class of jupiter mass planets with short periods ( 1 - 10 d ) .",
    "transiting planets are also very important in that their atmospheric composition may be determined from transmission spectroscopy for the brighter host stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "careful modelling of the transit morphology and/or timings may be used to constrain the presence of moons or rings and to probe the limb darkening of the star ( @xcite ) .    since the discovery of the transiting nature of hd 209458b , many transit candidates have been put forwards by various groups ( e.g : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ogle have been by far the most prolific transit survey with 177 transit candidates from three observational seasons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however ,",
    "even with the discovery of numerous candidates , follow - up observations have confirmed the planetary status of only six , bringing the total number of transiting planets to nine ( see @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the ubiquity of eclipsing binaries and the many observational scenarios involving these systems that mimic a transit event ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic and multi - band photometric observations are required to rule out the eclipsing binary scenarios and determine the mass of the companion ( e.g : @xcite ) .",
    "when hunting for new planets , the main advantage of the transit method over the radial - velocity technique is that many stars may be monitored in parallel and to fainter magnitudes , thus probing out beyond the solar neighbourhood . even though only a small fraction ( @xmath00.1% ) of stars are expected to exhibit a hot jupiter transit signal , by using a large field of view instrument on a crowded star field one can monitor enough stars to the precision required to detect a number of transiting planets .",
    "consequently large charge - coupled device ( ccd ) mosaic cameras are essential to the planet catch potential of a transit survey .",
    "a transit survey produces transit candidates that need follow - up observations to determine the nature of the transit signals .",
    "candidates confirmed as transiting planets add to our database of extra - solar planets and constrain their poorly known mass - radius relationship ( @xcite ) . to estimate the fraction of stars that harbour a planet ( the planet fraction ) as a function of spectral type and planet type we compare the number of transiting planets detected with a calculation of the expected number of transiting planet detections .",
    "even when zero planets are detected ( a null result ) such a calculation places upper limits on the planet fraction .    [ cols=\"<,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in reality",
    ", only a fraction @xmath3 of the stars considered in our monte carlo simulations harbour a planet of a specified type , instead of our assumed one planet per star .",
    "hence we must correct our calculations of the expected number of transiting planet detections by this factor .",
    "we refer to @xmath3 as the planet fraction .",
    "since @xmath3 is an unknown quantity that we would like to estimate , we may use the fact that the transit survey in bra05 has most likely produced a null result ( although this is still to be confirmed ) and place a significant upper limit on @xmath3 .",
    "first of all we make the assumption that the actual number of transiting planet detections @xmath4 has a poisson distribution with expected value @xmath5 given by : @xmath6 the poission distribution is defined by : @xmath7 for a null result , @xmath8 . using this fact and substituting eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ex ] into eqn .",
    "[ eqn : poisson ] we get : @xmath9 in order to obtain an upper limit on @xmath3 at the significance level @xmath10 we require : @xmath11 hence , from eqns .",
    "[ eqn : px0 ] and [ eqn : condition ] , we derive : @xmath12 the values of @xmath3 that we derive in this manner for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are shown in table [ tab : limits ] .",
    "for example , for @xmath16 , we place an upper limit of 1.42% on the 1 - 3  d very hot jupiter fraction based on the assumption that such planets have a typical radius of @xmath17 .",
    "our most conservative upper limits are obtained for @xmath15 and consequently these are the upper limits on @xmath3 that we consider in the discussion and conclusions .",
    "finally , we derive how the upper limit on @xmath3 scales with @xmath18 and @xmath19 by using eqn .",
    "[ eqn : empirical4 ] in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : upperlim ] : @xmath20 \\label{eqn : empirical5}\\ ] ]",
    "we have derived relatively stringent upper limits on the abundance of hot jupiters for the field of ngc  7789 .",
    "the most stringent upper limit on @xmath3 at @xmath16 of 0.79% is obtained for 1 - 3  d very hot jupiters of radius @xmath21 . for the sun - like g stars",
    ", we obtain limits on @xmath3 at @xmath16 of 2.82% for the 1 - 3  d very hot jupiters and 7.04% for the 3 - 5  d hot jupiters ( assuming @xmath22 ) .",
    "[ fig : limfig ] shows plots of the upper limit on the planet fraction @xmath3 at a significance level of 1% as a function of star type ( fig .",
    "[ fig : limfig1 ] ) and orbital period ( fig .",
    "[ fig : limfig2 ] ) for an assmued planetary radius of @xmath17 .",
    "we also show the estimate by @xcite that @xmath01% of nearby sun - like stars ( late f and g dwarfs ) host a 3 - 5  d hot jupiter , as derived from radial velocity observations ( dotted line ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the k stars are the most numerous in our star sample ( 15381 stars ) , it is the 7423 g stars that produce the largest expected number of transiting planets , and therefore the strictest upper limits on @xmath3 ( table [ tab : limits ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the g stars are generally brighter than the k stars in our sample , and therefore the corresponding gain in accuracy of the photometric measurements outweighs the smaller number of stars for which we can search for transits and the smaller transit signal for a given planetary radius .",
    "we may compare our results directly with those of @xcite by considering the late f and g stars in our sample and the corresponding expected number of transiting planets for the 3 - 5  d hot jupiters with @xmath22 .",
    "we expected to detect @xmath010.4 such planets around the late f stars in our sample , and @xmath065.4 such planets around the g stars in our sample , an expected total of @xmath075.7 3 - 5  d hot jupiters .",
    "this places an upper limit on @xmath3 of @xmath06.08% at the 1% significance level for these types of star and planet .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of the hot jupiter fraction derived by @xcite of @xmath23  1% and demonstrates with confidence that the hot jupiter fraction for sun - like stars in this field may not be more than a factor of @xmath06 times greater than that for the solar neighbourhood .    by considering the number of planets detected by the radial - velocity technique , and by the transit technique from the ogle survey , @xcite estimate that the relative frequency of 1 - 3  d very hot jupiters to 3 - 9  d hot jupiters is @xmath24 . using this result together with @xmath25  1% for hot jupiters ,",
    "the authors calculate that @xmath26 for 1 - 3  d very hot jupiters .",
    "this is consistent with our upper limit on @xmath3 at @xmath16 of 1.42% for 1 - 3  d very hot jupiters of radius @xmath17 .",
    "the calculation of the expected number of transiting planet detections for a transit survey has been discussed in varying levels of detail by several authors ( e.g : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . a requisite for such",
    "a calculation is an estimate of the masses and radii of the stars in the sample from observational constraints or a model for the star population that predicts these properties .    in this paper , we present a method for calculating in detail the detection probabilities ( and false alarm rates ) of transiting planets for photometric time - series data as functions of detection threshold , planetary radius and orbital period .",
    "the calculation is based on monte carlo simulations and requires the properties of the host stars to be known , either from observational constraints as in the case of stellar clusters or a model for the star population .",
    "we have shown how to convert these probabilities into an expected number of transiting planet detections as a function of star and planet type . for a null result in a transit survey",
    ", this information can be used to determine a significant upper limit on the planet fraction .    in the case of the transit survey of ngc  7789 presented in bra05",
    "we have derived upper limits on the planet fraction for the f , g , k and m stars in the sample and for three relevant period ranges of hot jupiters .",
    "we have also derived how these limits scale with detection threshold and planetary radius . in bra05",
    ", it is estimated that the survey expects to detect @xmath02 hd 209458b - like transiting planets or @xmath04 ogle - tr-56b - like transiting planets using simple arguments .",
    "our results indicate that for hd 209458b ( 3 - 5  d hot jupiter with @xmath27 ) , and under the assumption that @xmath23  1% , we also expect to detect @xmath02 such transiting planets . similarly for ogle - tr-56b ( 1 - 3  d very hot jupiter with @xmath28 ) , and again under the assumption that @xmath23  1% , we expect to detect @xmath03 such transiting planets .",
    "it is encouraging to note the agreement between the two methods although the simpler method from bra05 may tend to slightly over estimate the planetary detection rate .",
    "we conclude that the transit survey presented in bra05 reached the sensitivity required in order to detect a few hot jupiters if the abundance of such planets in the field of ngc  7789 is similar to that of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "improved survey design , mainly by employing a longer survey duration , will greatly improve the sensitivity to hot jupiters .",
    "it is well known that metal rich stars have a much higher probability of hosting an extra - solar planet ( @xcite ) and hence careful choice of the target star population will increase the probability of a detection . even in the presence of a null result , a more sensitive survey will allow the derivation of tighter limits on the planet abundance .",
