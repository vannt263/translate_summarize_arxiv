    "the korteveg  de vries ( kdv ) equation appears as a model for the propagation of weakly nonlinear dispersive waves in several fields like gravity driven waves on a surface of an incompressible irrotational inviscid fluid @xcite , ion acoustic waves in plasma @xcite , impulse propagation in electric circuits @xcite and so on .    in hydrodynamical context",
    "the kdv equation is obtained as first order approximation of euler equations with appropriate boundary conditions for the surface and the flat bottom .",
    "small parameters , like @xmath0 , ratio of the wave amplitude @xmath1 to the fluid depth @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a mean wavelength , are introduced . in the derivation of kdv the velocity potential of the fluid",
    "is expanded as a series with respect to the vertical coordinate and then only terms up to first order in small parameters are retained in all equations describing the system . despite of its simplicity , kdv equation appeared to be a good approximation for many phenomena , see e.g.  @xcite and focused enormous attention of physicists , mathematicians and engineers .    in order to extend possible applications of this kind of theories to the cases when",
    "parameters @xmath5 are not very small the second order approximation of velocity potential was considered and subsequently second order kdv type equation ( sometimes called extended kdv ) was derived , see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this equation , written in scaled coordinates and fixed reference frame has the following form ( @xmath6 is the surface wave function ) @xmath7 here and in the following the indexes denote partial derivatives , that is @xmath8 and so on .",
    "there were also attempts to extend the kdv theory to cases when the bottom of the fluid container is not flat .",
    "this subject is extremely important to understand the behaviour of waves coming to shallower regions and such phenomenon as tsunami creation .",
    "however , until last year there were no studies in this direction which could directly incorporate terms from the bottom function into the wave equation . in @xcite ,",
    "some of us derived second order kdv type equation containing terms directly related to the bottom function @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is another small parameter , @xmath12 stands for the amplitude of the bottom variations and @xmath2 is the undisturbed ( mean ) depth of the fluid .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath9 is continuous , at least three times differentiable and @xmath13 . for details of derivation of that equation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that when the bottom is flat , @xmath14 , the equation ( [ etaabd ] ) reduces to ( [ etaab ] ) .",
    "the present paper aims to find numerical solutions to stochastic versions of second order kdv type equations ( [ etaab ] ) and ( [ etaabd ] ) . in order to do this",
    "we first try to follow the finite element method ( fem ) used by debussche and printems in @xcite .",

    "this form was convenient for the authors in order to apply the finite element method ( fem ) in their numerical simulation .    in the case of periodic boundary conditions",
    "the noise term @xmath19 has to be introduced in a different way .",
    "since the brownian motions are nowhere differentiable we have to introduce the mathematical form of ( [ kdv ] ) .",
    "let @xmath20 denote a stochastic basis .",

    "our aim was to extend the approach used in @xcite in order to numerically solve second order stochastic version of the equation with an uneven bottom ( [ etaabd ] ) @xmath28 note that this equation , in contrast to kdv equation , has to be solved in the fixed coordinate system because transformation to a moving frame would make the bottom function time dependent .",
    "setting @xmath14 in ( [ etaabds ] ) one obtains second order stochastic kdv type equation ( that is the equation for the flat bottom ) @xmath29 which can be solved within the same algorithm .",

    "@xmath9 a sequence of three figures is presented in which the amplitude of the stochastic force is 0 , 0.001 and 0.002 , respectively . in this way the influence of an increasing stochastic term on the wave evolution is exhibited . in all presented cases @xmath105 , that is , the amplitude of the bottom variation is 20% of the average water depth . in order to avoid overlaps of the wave profiles at different time instants ,",
    "the consecutive profiles are shifted vertically by 0.15 .      in figures",
    "[ g000]-[g002 ] we compare time evolution of the wave ( initialy a kdv soliton ) when the bottom function represents a wide gaussian hump , @xmath106    in figures [ dg000]-[dg002 ] we compare time evolution of the wave ( initialy a kdv soliton ) when the bottom function represents a double gaussian hump , @xmath107.\\ ] ]    in figures [ h000]-[h002 ] we compare time evolution of the initial kdv soliton when the bottom function represents an extended hump , @xmath108    in figures [ v000]-[v002 ] time evolution of the initial kdv soliton is compared for different amplitude of the stochastic term when the bottom function represents a valley , @xmath109 .",
    "in all the examples presented , with different shapes of bottom functions , one observes the same general trend . when the amplitude of the stochastic force is relatively small ( @xmath110 ) , some small structures originated from second order terms in the evolution equation ( [ etaabd ] ) can be still visible . simultaneously",
    ", the main soliton wave is disturbed only a little by the stochastic term .    when the amplitude of the stochastic force increases , through @xmath111 which case is not shown here , to @xmath112 ,",
    "the structures from second order terms begin to be more and more obscured by the noise and are not visible at @xmath112 .",
    "the main wave , however , appears to be strongly resistant to the noise and preserves its soliton character .",
    "this character is preserved also for times much longer than in presented examples . to see that we needed , however , to adapt our different code , based on finite difference method , to the stochastic case .",
    "that code proved to be very efficient in numerical calculations presented in @xcite .",
    "the reasons why the finite difference method is more effective than finite element method presented here are explained in detail in the next section .",
    "the cnoidal solutions to kdv are expressed by the jacobi elliptic cn@xmath113 function .",
    "the explicit expression for such a solution is the following , see , e.g.  @xcite : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116.\\ ] ] solution ( [ cnsol])-([cnsol2 ] ) is written in dimensional quantities , where @xmath2 is the wave height , @xmath117 is mean water depth , @xmath118 is gravitational acceleration and @xmath119 is an elliptic parameter . @xmath120 and @xmath121 are complete elliptic integrals of the first and the second kind , respectively .",

    "the main conclusions obtained from our numerical simulations of time evolution of kdv - type waves with respect to second order equations with bottom terms are the following :    * both solitary and cnoidal solutions of kdv equations are extremely robust structures for many possible distortions . in previous studies",
    "@xcite we showed the resistance of these waves to second order terms in extended kdv equation , including terms from an uneven bottom . * in this paper we showed that an inclusion of a stochastic force into second order kdv - type equation does not disturb much the shape of the main wave even for large amplitude of the noise , although the secondary wave structures can be completely obscured by the noise .",
    "it seems , however , that the main wave is the most robust for solitary waves ( which is a limitnig case of cnoidal waves when @xmath119 tends to 1 ) .",
    "that robustness with respect to stochastic noise diminishes when parameter @xmath119 decreases below  1 . * finite element method , though sufficient for numerical study of stochastic kdv equation in @xcite is not so well suited for the higher order kdv type equation , and particularly less satisfactory when the bottom is not flat . for kdv equation considered in a moving frame ( [ kdv ] )",
    "the wave motion is slow and important time evolution can be calculated using not very long space and time intervals .",
    "this property allowed the authors of @xcite to use relatively low number @xmath130 of the mesh size to obtain relevant results .",
    "consequently , since kdv is a third order differential equation , the size of jacobian matrix used in numerical scheme , @xmath131 is still low and allows for fast calculations .",
    "second order ( `` extended '' ) kdv equation ( [ etaab ] ) , which is a differential equation of fifth order , can be studied both in a moving reference frame and in a fixed frame . in the first case",
    "the size of the jacobian increases to @xmath84 and when @xmath70 is of the same order the results can still be obtained in reasonable computing time .",
    "the equation taking into account bottom variation ( [ etaabd ] ) , however , has to be solved in the fixed frame .",
    "then , since waves move much faster , in order to obtain a good description of the wave evolution , substantially longer space intervals have to be used .",
    "for a resolution of fine structures of the wave relatively dense mesh has to be applied so @xmath70 is usually an order of magnitude larger than in the case of moving reference frame .",
    "then computer time for inversion of the jacobian becomes very large and detail calculations are not practical . in these cases the finite difference method used in @xcite , adapted for stochastic equation , proves to be more efficient .",
