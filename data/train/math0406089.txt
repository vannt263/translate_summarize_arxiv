    "this paper is the second in a series of articles @xcite on the statistics of vacua in string / m theory and associated effective supergravity theories .",
    "mathematically , vacua are critical points @xmath19 of a holomorphic section @xmath20 of a line bundle @xmath21 over a complex manifold relative to a connection @xmath22 which we always choose to be the chern connection @xmath2 of a hermitian metric @xmath5 on @xmath23 .",
    "equivalently , they are critical points of the norm @xmath24 of @xmath25 relative to @xmath5 .",
    "our motivation to study critical points of holomorphic sections in this metric sense comes initially from physics , where critical points of this kind model extremal black holes in addition to string / m vacua ( cf .",
    "but we also find the statistics of critical points to have an independent geometric interest . a basic statistical quantity",
    ", the average number of critical points of a random holomorphic section , defines a new geometric invariant of a positive hermitian holomorphic line bundle , and in this paper we show that its asymptotic minima are given by calabi extremal metrics .",
    "the physical setting for vacua of string / m theory ( and for extremal black holes ) is a holomorphic line bundle over the moduli space of complex structures on a polarized calabi - yau manifold .",
    "supersymmetric vacua are critical points of a holomorphic section ( known as a superpotential ) relative to the weil - petersson metric .",
    "the program of studying statistics of critical points of gaussian random holomorphic sections was proposed by the first author @xcite as a means of dealing with the large number of string / m vacua .",
    "there exists at this time no reasonable selection principle to decide which superpotential nor which of its critical points gives the vacuum state which correctly describes our universe in string / m theory , so it makes sense to study the statistics of vacua of random superpotentials .    in our first paper @xcite",
    ", we gave explicit formulas for the expected distribution of critical points of sections of general holomorphic line bundles over any complex manifold , including those which arise in physics .",
    "the formulas , recalled in  [ background ] ( cf .",
    "theorem [ kncrit2 ] ) , involve complicated complex symmetric matrix integrals , and it is difficult to see how the expected distribution of critical points depends on the metric @xmath5 .",
    "the purpose of this article is therefore to study a purely geometric simplification of the physical problem where @xmath26 is a positive hermitian line bundle over a ( usually compact ) khler manifold @xmath3 and where the gaussian measure on @xmath27 is derived from the inner product induced by @xmath5 .",
    "our aim is to understand the metric dependence of the statistics of the random critical point set @xmath28 of a gaussian random section of @xmath27 .",
    "we note that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the zero set of @xmath25 .    from the probabilistic viewpoint ,",
    "the critical points of random holomorphic sections relative to the chern connection @xmath2 of a fixed hermitian metric on @xmath23 determine a _ point process _ on @xmath3 , that is , a measure on the configuration space of finite subsets of @xmath3 , which gives the probability density of a finite subset being the critical point set of a holomorphic section .",
    "the process is determined by its @xmath31-point correlation functions @xmath32 , which give the probability density of critical points occurring simultaneously at the points @xmath33 .",
    "in this article , we focus on the @xmath34-point correlation , namely the expected distribution of critical points @xmath35\\,d{\\gamma}_h(s)\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the dirac point mass at @xmath37 , and where @xmath38 is the gaussian measure probability @xmath39 on @xmath27 induced by @xmath5 and the khler form @xmath40 ( see  [ background ] ) .",
    "we showed in @xcite that @xmath41 is a smooth form on @xmath3 if @xmath23 is sufficiently positive .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the expected ( average ) number of critical points @xmath42 of a random section , a purely geometric invariant of a positive hermitian holomorphic line bundle @xmath43",
    ". the methods of this paper also give results on general @xmath31-point correlations between critical points and their scaling asymptotics in the sense of @xcite , but we do not carry out the analysis here .    since it is a crucial point ,",
    "let us explain why the number @xmath44 is a ( non - constant ) random variable on @xmath45 , unlike the number of zeros of @xmath12 independent sections which is a topological invariant of @xmath23 . as indicated above , connection critical points are the same as critical points of @xmath46 for which @xmath47 , or equivalently as critical points of @xmath48 ( see @xcite for the simple proof ) .",
    "hence , there are critical points of each morse index @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) , and only the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index is a topological invariant .",
    "another way to understand the metric dependence of the number of critical points is to write the covariant derivative in a local frame @xmath50 as @xmath51 where we locally express a section as @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the critical point equation @xmath54 in the local frame fails to be holomorphic when the connection form is only smooth .",
    "although @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend on @xmath5 , it is not clear at the outset whether @xmath4 is a topological invariant or to what degree it depends on the metric @xmath5 . to investigate the metric dependence of @xmath57 and @xmath4 we consider their asymptotic behavior as we take powers @xmath58 of @xmath23 . as in @xcite",
    ", it is natural to expect that the density and number of critical points will have asymptotic expansions which reveal their metric dependence .",
    "we therefore let @xmath59 denote the expected distribution of critical points of random holomorphic sections @xmath60 with respect to the chern connection and hermitian gaussian measure induced by @xmath5 , as given by  in  [ background ] .",
    "we also let @xmath61 denote the expected number of critical points .",
    "the covariant derivative associated to @xmath62 has the semi - classical form @xmath63    we let @xmath64 denote the curvature form of @xmath65 .",
    "our first result is a complete asymptotic expansion for the expected distribution of critical points for powers @xmath66 in terms of curvature invariants of the khler metric @xmath67 :    [ univdist ] for any positive hermitian line bundle @xmath68 over any compact khler manifold with @xmath69 , the expected critical point distribution of holomorphic sections of @xmath58 relative to the hermitian gaussian measure induced by @xmath5 and @xmath70 has an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath71 where the coefficients @xmath72 are curvature invariants of order @xmath73 of @xmath74 . in particular",
    ", @xmath75 is the universal constant @xmath76 @xmath77 , where @xmath14 is the scalar curvature of @xmath70 and @xmath78 is a universal constant , and @xmath79 is a quadratic curvature polynomial .    here , @xmath80 is the space of @xmath81 complex symmetric matrices .",
    "it follows that the density of critical points is asymptotically uniform relative to the curvature volume form with a universal asymptotic density @xmath82 .",
    "the values of the constant @xmath75 for low dimensions are : @xmath83 ( see appendix 1 . )    with only minor changes in the proofs , our methods give refinements of the asymptotic results which take the morse indices of the critical points into account . by the morse index @xmath84 of a critical point ,",
    "we mean its morse index as a critical point of @xmath85 ; it is well known that @xmath86 for positive line bundles @xcite .",
    "thus we let @xmath87 denote the expected distribution of critical points of @xmath88 of morse index @xmath84 , and we let @xmath89 denote the expected number of these critical points .",
    "thus we have @xmath90 we obtain a similar asymptotic expansion for the distribution of critical points of given morse index :    [ univmorse ] let @xmath91 be as above",
    ". then the expected density of critical points of morse index @xmath84 of random sections in @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 where the @xmath94 are curvature invariants of order @xmath73 of @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , @xmath95 is given by the integral in with the domain of integration @xmath96 replaced by @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "the coefficient integrals are very complicated to evaluate except in dimension one , where we obtain the following formula :    [ critrs ] let @xmath65 be a positive line bundle on a compact complex curve @xmath99 of genus @xmath100",
    ". then the expected number of saddle points and of local maxima , respectively , of random holomorphic sections of @xmath58 are given by : @xmath101 where @xmath102 , and @xmath14 is the gaussian curvature of the metric @xmath70 .    hence , the expected total number of critical points in dimension 1 is @xmath103 in dimension 1 , the coefficients in theorem [ univmorse ] are : @xmath104 in appendix 1 , we provide a table of numerical values of @xmath105 ( for @xmath106 ) , which we computed using maple .    in  [ s - exact ] , we study the case where @xmath107 and @xmath65 is the hyperplane section bundle @xmath108 with the fubini - study metric .",
    "we show that in this case the expected number @xmath89 of critical points of morse index @xmath84 of sections in @xmath109 is a rational function of @xmath8 , and we provide an exact formula ( proposition [ numcrit ] ) for this expected number . in appendix  1 , we use proposition [ numcrit ] and a computer assisted computation to give explicit formulas for @xmath89 in dimensions @xmath110 . for example , in dimension 1 , the expected total number of critical points , as computed in @xcite , is @xmath111 and in dimension 2 , the expected total number is @xmath112    thus we gain a quantitative sense of how many more critical points there are in the metric sense in comparison with the classical critical point equation @xmath113 . in the case of @xmath114 , whose sections are polynomials of degree @xmath8 , we may view this classical critical point equation as a connection critical point equation by viewing the derivative @xmath115 as a flat meromorphic connection with pole at @xmath116 .",
    "alternately , it is the chern connection of a singular hermitian metric . the critical point equation being purely holomorphic , the number of critical points of a generic section is a constant @xmath117 .",

    "sections @xmath118 have , on average , an additional @xmath119 local maxima and @xmath120 additional saddles relative to the fubini - study connection .",
    "the study of critical points relative to meromorphic connections ( known as minkowski vacua ) is simpler than that relative to chern connections and will be explored further in a subsequent work .    as a corollary of theorem [ univmorse ]",
    ", we find the rather surprising fact that the asymptotics of the expected number of critical points is a topological invariant of the bundle @xmath21 to two orders in @xmath8 .",
    "[ en ] let @xmath121 be a positive holomorphic line bundle on a compact khler manifold , with @xmath122 . then the expected number of critical points of morse index @xmath84 ( @xmath86 ) of random sections in @xmath92 has the asymptotic expansion @xmath123n^m + \\left[\\frac{\\pi^m{\\beta}_{1q}}{(m-1)!}\\ , c_1(m)\\cdot c_1(l)^{m-1}\\right]n^{m-1 } \\nonumber \\\\&+ & \\left[{\\beta}_{2q}\\int_m\\rho^2d{{\\operatorname{vol}}}_h + { \\beta}'_{2q}\\ , c_1(m)^2\\cdot c_1(l)^{m-2 } + { \\beta}''_{2q}\\ , c_2(m)\\cdot c_1(l)^{m-2}\\right ] n^{m-2}+\\cdots\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 are universal constants depending only on the dimension @xmath12 .",
    "we recall that the alternating sum of the @xmath89 is topological : @xmath125 and hence by corollary [ en ] , @xmath126 since each @xmath127 is strictly positive and their sum equals @xmath75 , it follows from that @xmath128    corollary [ en ] shows that the metric dependence of @xmath129 is a ` lower - order ' effect , and hence renews the question to what degree @xmath130 , or at least the asymptotic expansion of @xmath131 , is a topological invariant .",
    "we see from corollary [ en ] that the expansion is not topological provided that the constant @xmath132 does not vanish .",
    "computations in dimensions @xmath133 show that @xmath134 is positive in these dimensions ( see corollary [ less4 ] ) , and we conjecture that @xmath135 for all @xmath12 . as we now explain , this conjecture is suggested by a connection between extremals of @xmath136 and calabi extremal metrics @xcite .",
    "this connection involves a notion of asymptotic minimality of @xmath137 . to introduce it ,",
    "we revisit the motivating problem of determining how @xmath4 varies as @xmath5 varies over hermitian metrics on @xmath23 .",
    "one could consider all hermitian metrics on @xmath23 , but we focus on the smaller class of positively curved hermitian metrics , @xmath138 if we fix one such metric @xmath139 , the others may be expressed as @xmath140 with @xmath141 it is reasonable to conjecture that @xmath142 is unbounded as @xmath143 varies over @xmath144 , since by ( [ cpe ] ) the number of critical points of a section should be ` large ' if the ` degree ' of the connection form @xmath145 is ` large ' .",
    "here , @xmath146 in a local frame . on the other hand , @xmath4 is bounded below by @xmath147 , and it is plausible that it has a minimum",
    ". it would be interesting to determine this minimal metric ( assuming one exists and is unique ) , but it is difficult to solve the critical point equation @xmath148 .",
    "we therefore consider the simpler asymptotic problem .",
    "since the first two leading coefficients in the expansion of @xmath137 are topological , we try to find metrics for which the first non - topological term is critical .",
    "the first non - topological term is a multiple of the calabi functional @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the scalar curvature of the khler metric @xmath122 , and @xmath151 .",
    "thus the problem of finding metrics which are critical for the metric invariant @xmath137 is closely related to the problem of finding critical points of calabi s functional . in keeping with our intuition that @xmath137 should have a minimizer , we note that critical points of calabi s functional are necessarily minima ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "existence of critical metrics is one of the fundamental problems in complex geometry , and we refer to @xcite for background .",
    "it was suggested by s .-",
    "yau @xcite that existence of a canonical metric should be related to the stability of @xmath3 .",
    "one class of canonical metrics are hermitian metrics @xmath5 for which @xmath152 is a khler metric of constant scalar curvature , i.e. for which @xmath150 is constant . by a theorem due to s. donaldson ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cor .  5 )",
    ", there exists at most one khler metric of constant scalar curvature in the cohomology class of @xmath153 .",
    "hence if there exists such a metric of constant scalar curvature , there exists a unique hermitian metric minimizing calabi s functional .",
    "this leads us to make the following definition :    let @xmath21 be an ample holomorphic line bundle over a compact khler manifold . for @xmath154 and @xmath155",
    ", we say that @xmath156 ( resp .",
    "@xmath137 ) is _ asymptotically minimal _ if for all @xmath157 in @xmath158 , there exists @xmath159 such that @xmath160    assuming @xmath161 has a hermitian metric @xmath5 minimizing calabi s functional , we see from corollary [ en ] that @xmath156 ( resp .",

    "additional evidence that @xmath175 was found by b. baugher @xcite . by studying patterns in computer - assisted calculations of the terms arising from the computation of the integral in ( [ k0intro ] ) , baugher discovered an identity for @xmath176 for dimensions @xmath17 which he conjectures is valid in all dimensions .",
    "baugher showed that this identity implies that @xmath177 in all dimensions , and hence baugher s conjecture implies conjecture [ conj ] .",

    "the proof of theorems [ univdist ] and [ univmorse ] is based on the tian - yau - zelditch asymptotic expansion of the szeg kernel @xmath178 @xcite and on formulas from @xcite for the density of critical points .",

    "once we know the leading coefficient is universal , we may calculate it for @xmath179 and this is done in  [ s - exact ] and appendix  1 .",
    "unfortunately , the fubini - study metric is not useful for finding the sign of @xmath180 since it is impossible to separate out the topologically invariant terms from the calabi functional for this metric .",
    "hence in  [ s - coeff ] , we analyze instead the case of @xmath181 for @xmath182 an elliptic curve , where the relevant topological terms vanish .",
