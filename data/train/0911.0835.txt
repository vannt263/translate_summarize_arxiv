    "dictyostelium discoideum_. such a phenomenon does not take place if the density of cells is too low .",
    "more precisely , given a non - negative integrable initial condition @xmath8 with finite second moment , the system has a unique maximal classical solution @xmath9 defined on some maximal time interval @xmath10 , @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "its first component @xmath5 is non - negative and the mass of @xmath5 ( that is , its @xmath12-norm ) remains constant through time evolution @xmath13 it is well - known that , if @xmath14 , the solution to exists globally in time while it blows up in finite time if @xmath15 , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "more recently , it was shown that there is global existence as well for the critical mass @xmath16 , the blowup occurring in infinite time with a profile being a dirac mass of mass @xmath17 @xcite . when the mass @xmath18 is above @xmath17 , the shape of the finite time blowup is not self - similar according to asymptotic expansions computed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a related problem in a bounded domain ) .",
    "in addition , there is no integrable and radially symmetric blowing - up self - similar solution to ( * ? ? ? * theorem  8) .    in space dimension",
    "@xmath19 , the system   seems to be less relevant from the biological point of view as blowup may occur whatever the value of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this means that the diffusion is too weak to balance the aggregation resulting from the chemotactic term .",
    "it is however well - known that one can enhance the effect of diffusion to prevent crowding by considering a diffusion of porous medium type which increases the diffusion of the cells when their density @xmath5 is large .",
    "this is the generalised version of the patlak - keller - segel model considered in , e.g. , @xcite : @xmath20 -   \\rho(t , x)\\nabla c(t , x)\\right)\\,,\\vspace{.3cm}\\\\ c(t , x ) = ( e_d\\star\\rho)(t , x)\\ , , \\quad e_d(x ) = c_d\\ |x|^{2-d}\\ , ,    \\end{array } \\quad ( t , x ) \\in [ 0,\\infty ) \\times { \\mathbb r}^d\\ , , \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denotes the surface area of the sphere @xmath24 of @xmath25 .",

    ", it turns out that there is only one critical exponent of the non - linear diffusion , namely @xmath26 , such that the mass plays a similar role to that in  . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath27 the diffusion enhancement is too strong and the solutions always exist globally in time whereas if @xmath28 the diffusion is not strong enough to compensate the aggregation term and there are solutions blowing up in finite time whatever the value of the mass  @xcite .",
    "the relevant diffusion is thus achieved in the case when @xmath29 . in this case , it was proved in  @xcite that there is a unique threshold mass @xmath0 with the following properties : if the mass @xmath30 of the initial condition @xmath8 is less or equal to @xmath1 , then the corresponding solution to exists globally in time , whereas given any @xmath31 there are initial data @xmath8 with mass @xmath18 such that the corresponding solution blows up in finite time .",
    "thus , for the peculiar choice @xmath29 and @xmath3 , the system exhibits the same qualitative behaviour as the pks system in space dimension @xmath2 .",
    "still , there is a fundamental difference as the latter has no fast - decaying stationary solution with mass @xmath17 while the former has a two - parameter family of non - negative , integrable , and compactly supported stationary solutions with mass @xmath1 for each @xmath3  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) .",
    "it is then tempting to figure out whether this striking difference extends above the critical mass @xmath1 and this leads us to investigate the existence of blowing - up ( or backward ) self - similar solutions with finite mass .",
    "more precisely , since mass remains unchanged throughout time evolution , we look for solutions @xmath9 to with @xmath29 and @xmath3 of the form @xmath32 for @xmath33 with @xmath34^{1/d}$ ] , the time @xmath35 being an arbitrary positive real number .",
