    "the decays and are two of the ` golden modes ' for measuring ckm parameters .",
    "measurement of the branching ratio b ( ) provides a clean and unambiguous determination of the ckm matrix element , in particular of the quantity @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in is quite small ( @xmath57% ) and even smaller in ( @xmath52% ) , as the hadronic matrix element can be extracted from the branching ratio .",
    "the branching ratios have been calculated to next - to - leading - log approximation  @xcite , complete with isospin violation corrections  @xcite and two - loop - electroweak effects  @xcite .",
    "fits based on the best current data for the ckm matrix elements give branching ratios of  @xcite @xmath6 these branching ratios are very small and , with two neutrinos in the final state , both of these experiments are challenging .",
    "the e787 experiment at bnl was designed to search for and reported the first observation of from analysis of the 1995 data set  @xcite .",
    "a new analysis of the 1995 data combined with the 1996 and 1997 data sets , has reduced the background levels by about a factor of three . a plot from the 199597 data set  @xcite of the range vs. energy of events passing all other criteria",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : r_e ] .",
    "one event is observed in the signal region with a measured background of @xmath7 events .",
    "the branching ratio is b ( ) = @xmath8 . from this measurement ,",
    "a limit on of @xmath9 can be derived , as well as the following limits on @xmath10 : @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the e787 experiment has finished running and the final sensitivity , based on the complete 199598 data set , should reach the sm expectation for .      a new experiment under construction , e949 , is expected to run in 200103 , symbiotically with rhic .",
    "e949 will use the ags proton beam , between fills of rhic , for approximately 20 hours / day .",
    "the e787 experiment has already demonstrated sufficient background rejection ( @xmath510% of the sm signal ) for a very precise measurement of b ( ) .",
    "taking advantage of the very large ags proton flux and the experience gained with the e787 detector , e949 with modest upgrades should observe @xmath13(10 ) sm events in a two year run .",
    "the background is small and well - understood .",
    "the ckm experiment was proposed in 1998 and has been pursuing r&d towards a full technical proposal in 2001 as e905 at fnal .",
    "it would run simultaneously with the tevatron collider using protons from the main injector that are not needed for the collider and extract them over a long spill ( @xmath51 sec ) .",
    "ckm plans to collect @xmath13(100 ) sm events with a background of @xmath13(10 ) events , starting sometime after 2005 .",
    "this experiment will use an intense rf - separated 22 gev / c kaon beam derived from the main injector .",
    "this novel k@xmath14 decay - in - flight technique will obtain redundant kinematic measurements from independent momentum and velocity spectrometers .",
    "the kaon momentum will be measured in a si spectrometer and the pion momentum in straw - tube drift chambers in the vacuum decay region .",
    "the velocities of the kaon and pion will be measured in rich counters .",
    "two large pb - scintillator photon veto systems reduce backgrounds from decays and a muon veto system reduces background from decays .",
    "presently , the best limit on is derived in a model - independent way  @xcite from the e787 measurement of : @xmath16 the best direct limits come from the ktev experiment at fnal .",
    "ktev used a narrow ` pencil ' beam to define the transverse vertex position of @xmath17 decays in a one - day test run and observed one background event , probably from a neutron interaction . from this special run , a 90%-cl limit  @xcite of b ( )",
    "@xmath18 was established .",
    "a better limit is obtained using the @xmath19 decay , which is inherently a factor of 80 less sensitive but has the significant advantage of a precise vertex location .",
    "since the vertex location is known a larger , more intense kaon beam can be used ; and the background levels are lower as the transverse momentum is known with better precision . in the full 1997 ktev data",
    "set no events were seen , and at the 90% confidence level , @xmath20 the @xmath21 distribution of @xmath19 events passing all other cuts can be seen in figure  [ fig : e799_pnn ] .",
    "the expected background was @xmath22 mainly from @xmath23 and @xmath24    the next generation of experiments , all using the @xmath17 decay mode , will start with e391a at kek , which hopes to reach a sensitivity of @xmath5@xmath25 , using a technique similar to ktev .",
    "although the reach of e391a is not sufficient to observe a signal at the standard model level , the experiment will be able to rule out large enhancements from new physics and learn more about how to do this difficult experiment .",
    "it is designed around a pencil @xmath2 beam , a high - resolution crystal calorimeter , and very efficient photon veto systems .",
    "this experiment would eventually move to the jhf and aim for a sensitivity of @xmath26 .",
    "two other major efforts to observe and measure are kami and kopio .",
    "the kami collaboration submitted an expression of interest at fnal for an experiement to measure b ( ) .",
    "kami , like ckm , will make use of a slow extracted spill from the main injector , simultaneous with the operation of the tevatron .",
    "kami plans to reuse the excellent ktev csi calorimeter , with a single high intensity pencil @xmath2 beam directed through a hole in the middle .",
    "the decay volume upstream of the calorimeter will be surrounded by a hermetic , highly efficient array of photon veto detectors .",
    "an additional photon detector will catch photons escaping along the beam .",
    "the current design of the kami detector includes a fiber tracker to expand the number of secondary modes to be studied .",
    "kami expects to detect @xmath27(100 ) sm events in a couple of years of running with a background of @xmath540% of the sm signal .",
    "the kopio experiment at bnl has been given scientific approval and is currently undergoing funding review .",
    "it plans to run at the ags after the completion of e949 and in the same mode , with @xmath520 hours per day available between rhic fills .",
    "kopio will reconstruct the kaon center of mass using a bunched proton beam and a very low momentum @xmath2 beam .",
    "this technique allows for two independent criteria to reject background , photon veto and kinematics  allowing background levels to be directly measured from the data  and encourages further confidence in the signal by measuring the momentum spectrum of the decay .",
    "the necessary kaon flux will be obtained using the large available ags proton current .",
    "the low - energy beam also substantially reduces backgrounds from neutrons and other sources . after three years of running",
    ", 65 standard - model events are expected with a s / b @xmath28 2:1 .",
    "the unprecedented sensitivities of rare kaon decay experiments and the recent discovery of have opened doors to the measurement of the unitarity triangle completely within the kaon system .",
    "significant progress in the determination of the fundamental ckm parameters will come from the generation of experiments that is now starting .",
    "these measurements can provide critical , unambiguous determination of the standard - model _ cp _ violation parameters .",
    "comparison with the b - system will then over - constrain the triangle and test the sm explanation of _ cp _ violation :    * comparison of the angle @xmath29 from the ratio b()/b ( ) and the cp asymmetry in the decay will provide one of the most important tests  @xcite . *",
    "comparison of the magnitude @xmath30 from and the ratio of the mixing frequencies of @xmath31 to @xmath32 mesons will also provide an important test with small theoretical uncertainty  @xcite .",
