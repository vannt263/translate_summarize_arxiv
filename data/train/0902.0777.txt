    "in the past decade , much progress has been made in the development of quantum dot devices for quantum information processing , spurred by the spin qubit proposal of loss and divincenzo.@xcite in gaas devices , recent achievements have included single electron occupation of a quantum dot,@xcite pulsed gating and single shot readout,@xcite and qubit rotations about an arbitrary axis.@xcite however , it was noted early on that materials properties in silicon are potentially well suited for quantum computing.@xcite predominant among these are weak spin - orbit coupling and the ready availability of a nuclear spin-0 isotope .",
    "several proposals were put forth for silicon - based quantum dot spin qubits.@xcite many of the technological achievements made in gaas have now been realized in si .",
    "recent experimental advances include controlled tunnel barriers in modulation doped,@xcite degenerately doped,@xcite and undoped enhancement - mode devices,@xcite coupling between a quantum dot and a nearby charge sensor,@xcite controlled tunnel coupling between two sides of a double dot,@xcite single electron occupation of a quantum dot,@xcite and observations of coherent quantum phenomena involving spins.@xcite    on the other hand , it is known that the multi - valley structure of the conduction band in si may pose a challenge for quantum computing.@xcite in the context of quantum dot spin qubits in strained silicon heterostructures , it is necessary for the two - fold degeneracy of the two - dimensional electron gas to be lifted sufficiently that spins , not valleys , form the relevant two - level system.@xcite    the magnitude of the valley splitting has now been measured in strained si quantum wells at both high fields @xcite and low fields.@xcite in certain cases , the measured values are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than expected from theoretical calculations.@xcite such splitting is too small for robust quantum computing applications .",
    "it appears that the unexpected suppression is caused by atomic - scale steps at the quantum well interface , as originally suggested by ando.@xcite in this picture , the steps can arise from the underlying miscut in the growth substrate , which is transferred to the interface by conformal epitaxial deposition . alternatively , they can be a consequence of strain - induced roughness . in either case ,",
    "when an electronic wavefunction extends laterally over many steps , the valley splitting can not be maximized on every step , leading to an overall suppression of the valley splitting .",
    "since the valleys states include a phase factor whose value depends on the position of the interface,@xcite the suppression of valley splitting can be interpreted as an interference effect caused by multiple steps.@xcite    it should therefore be possible to overcome the suppression of valley splitting by laterally confining the wavefunction to a small number of steps .",
    "this proposal was put to the test in recent experiments by probing the valley splitting under strong electrostatic or magnetic confinement , in a quantum point contact geometry.@xcite under such conditions , the valley splitting was restored to its expected theoretical value . by the same token",
    ", a smooth interface could partially explain the exceptionally large valley splitting observed at a si / sio@xmath0 inversion layer.@xcite    for quantum computing applications , we are most interested in quantum dot devices , where the confinement is controlled by the top - gate geometry and the application of gate voltages and magnetic fields .",
    "recent experiments have shown that excitation energies in few - electron quantum dots may be of order 0.1 - 0.3  mev , which provides an estimate for the valley splitting.@xcite from a quantum computing perspective , the size of this splitting is encouraging , since it is larger than both the typical electron temperature in a dilution refrigerator ( @xmath1  mk ) , and the zeeman spin splitting in fields up to about 2  t. ( note that valley splitting and zeeman splitting are both functions of the magnetic field . ) the magnitude of the valley splitting therefore appears sufficient for quantum computing in many cases .",
    "however , it is essential to understand the complicated dependence of valley splitting on the shape of the quantum dot and on the materials parameters associated with silicon heterostructures . in the context of decoherence ,",
    "it is important to understand how valley - orbit coupling causes quantum dot orbitals to hybridize .",
    "the latter effect plays a role in valley scattering , and can allow the spin qubit to leak into a higher dimensional spin - valley hilbert space .",
    "there are many possible approaches to modeling silicon quantum dots , ranging from highly simplified geometries , such as circular quantum dots on a flat quantum well interface , to realistic three - dimensional structures with top - gates and disordered interfaces .",
    "while the simple geometries may be treated analytically , the more realistic geometries require numerical methods . in this paper , we take a middle road by solving a somewhat complicated model that still allows analytical solutions . specifically , we study inter - orbital valley coupling in a quantum dot with an elliptical shape and arbitrary step orientation , in parallel or perpendicular magnetic fields . in a previous numerical analysis",
    ", we also included the effects of interfacial disorder in circular dots,@xcite although we did not account for inter - orbital valley coupling .",
    "in that case , we observed that interfacial step disorder has a strong moderating effect on the suppression of valley splitting .",
    "because disorder is not easy to accommodate in our analytical treatment , we focus here on a uniform interface .",
    "however , we do allow for an _ effective _ tilt angle , which approximates some aspects of disorder .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : voc ] we describe our theoretical method and procedure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : parallel ] , we consider a quantum dot geometry with the magnetic field oriented parallel to the sample surface .",
    "general solutions are obtained for the valley coupling in an elliptical quantum dot , whose orientation with respect to the steps is arbitrary .",
    "we solve several important limiting cases , including high aspect ratios and circular quantum dots . in sec .",
    "[ sec : perpendicular ] , we study circular and elliptical quantum dots in a perpendicular field geometry . in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] , we summarize our main results and provide an intuitive explanation for the origin of valley - orbit coupling .",
    "we discuss some consequences of valley - orbit coupling and why valley splitting is not an entirely well - defined quantity .",
    "we also discuss materials parameters that affect the magnitude of the valley splitting , such as disorder at the interface , and we suggest future experiments to characterize these materials properties . in the appendix , we provide a discussion of the important approximations used in this paper , including the treatment of the the interfacial tilt as smooth and uniform .",
    "we build on the work of ref .   to develop an effective mass theory of valley coupling in a quantum dot .",
    "in contrast with most previous theories , we now include inter - orbital couplings .",
    "these have a significant effect on the valley splitting in typical qubit devices , and they are essential for understanding valley scattering .    in this theory , we treat the valley coupling as a perturbation .",
    "thus , at zeroth order , valleys do not enter the analysis except through the anisotropic effective mass tensor .",
    "the resulting equations have a simple form for inversion layers@xcite and strained silicon heterostructures,@xcite since only @xmath2 valleys are low enough in energy to play a role in the calculations . in this case",

    "the interaction @xmath15 mixes unperturbed orbitals with different quantum numbers @xmath13 ,",
    "so eq .  ( [ eq : envelope ] ) must include a sum over the index @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting eigenstates of the perturbation hamiltonian are indexed by a new label , @xmath21 , with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath22 and eigenvectors @xmath23 , whose components span the unperturbed basis set @xmath24 . due to valley - orbit mixing , it is not appropriate to distinguish between orbital and valley quantum numbers in realistic quantum dots , except in certain limiting cases .",
    "the index @xmath21 is therefore a combined valley - orbital label .",
    "we note that umklapp terms are absent in the summation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : envelope ] ) . in the context of valley coupling by a shallow donor ,",
    "the omission of umklapp processes is known to give numerical errors in the calculation of binding energies.@xcite while these might be resolved by going beyond conventional effective mass theory,@xcite the conventional theory does provide acceptable results and intuitive explanations that are in agreement with more detailed analyses , both for single - valley and multi - valley semiconductors.@xcite for quantum wells , the two - valley treatment of eq .",
    "( [ eq : envelope ] ) provides remarkable agreement with more sophisticated theories.@xcite this is not surprising  one would expect the umklapp errors to be suppressed in quantum wells , as compared to donors , because the fourier transformed potential @xmath25 decays more quickly in reciprocal space .",
    "based on the overall agreement between effective mass and more detailed theories , we will not pursue umklapp processes here .    each term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : envelope ] ) corresponds to a different unperturbed valley orbital , identified by indices @xmath26 and @xmath13 : @xmath27 it is also convenient to define a special index referring to the opposite valley , @xmath28 , such that @xmath29    as discussed elsewhere,@xcite the valley coupling potential takes the form of a @xmath30-function in the effective mass theory : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the position of the sharp quantum well interface . in principle , one @xmath30-function potential should be included for each interface of the quantum well .",
    "however , in a typical modulation - doped device , the envelope function is centered near the top interface ( closest to the doping layer ) , and is exponentially suppressed at the bottom interface .",
    "therefore , we include only one @xmath30-function , for the top interface .",
    "( if necessary , a second interface could easily be included in the theory . )",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dfn1 ] ) describes a geometry where the interface occurs on a horizontal plane in the @xmath5 coordinate system .",
    "this assumes that the stepped interface can be approximated as uniformly tilted .",
    "the validity of such an approximation is discussed in detail in the appendix . in brief , since a single - atom step of height @xmath33    is much smaller than any effective mass length scale , the continuum approximation is well justified in most situations .",
    "additionally , the assumption of a smooth interface is well - justified , locally , in the absence of significant step bunching .",
    "when we compute matrix elements , as described below , it is more convenient to transform to the crystallographic @xmath4 coordinate system : @xmath34 where @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the interfacial tilt angle , which is typically small .",
    "for example , samples grown on commercial substrates may have @xmath37 , corresponding to a step width of 3.9  nm .",
    "@xmath38 is the tilt direction in the @xmath39-@xmath40 plane , with @xmath41 corresponding to a downhill slope in the @xmath39 direction . for a quantum dot covering many steps",
    ", the valley coupling should depend very weakly on the relative position , @xmath42 , as we have verified numerically . in the opposite limit of very few steps",
    ", we should treat the steps explicitly , as described in the appendix . for the present analysis , where we treat the interface as smoothly tilted , it is appropriate to choose the value of @xmath42 to simplify our calculations",
    ".    the parameter @xmath36 should be viewed as an effective tilt angle .",
    "( see appendix . )",
    "normal growth dynamics tend to produce interfaces that are disordered,@xcite so the local tilt angle can differ from the global tilt . as discussed below , lower ground state energies can be attained at flat interfaces .",
    "confined electrons will therefore adjust their center positions slightly , to seek out locally flat regions .",
    "a more careful treatment of this phenomenon , and disorder in general , lies outside the scope of the present work .",
    "however , we can capture some of the relevant physics simply by treating @xmath36 as an effective , locally - averaged tilt angle .    to solve eq .",

    "( [ eq : me2 ] ) are primed , we henceforth drop the prime notation for simplicity , except where noted .    when @xmath54 and @xmath59 , eq .  ( [ eq : me2 ] ) simplifies , due to the orthonormality of the valley orbitals .",
    "the result is proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "however , when @xmath61 , the phase factors inside the integral are non - vanishing , and inter - orbital couplings arise .",
    "in this way , we see that the tilt of the quantum well is directly responsible for the off - diagonal valley - orbit coupling .",
    "since roughness is ubiquitous in realistic devices , we must always expect some degree of inter - orbital valley coupling .",
    "the emergence of inter - orbital coupling has further interesting consequences .",
    "first , it causes broken time - reversal symmetry . when @xmath59 , the perturbation produces only intra - orbital terms ; the valley coupling is identical for every orbital , and its phase factor is trivial , since it can be eliminated by setting @xmath62 .",
    "but when @xmath61 , the inter - orbital couplings are complex , and they can not be trivially removed .",
    "the perturbation hamiltonian is intrinsically complex , and time reversal symmetry is broken.@xcite similar behavior is observed in the multi - valley graphene system , with important implications for weak localization.@xcite second , the valley index can no longer be treated as a good quantum number . when @xmath59 , the valley labels are universal , in the sense that they have the same meaning for every orbital . in a square",
    "well , for example , the wavefunctions can be unambiguously characterized as odd or even.@xcite however , when @xmath61 , there is no universal labeling scheme .",
    "valley - orbit coupling causes level mixing , which differs from orbital to orbital .",
    "the effective mass approximation forms the basis of our analysis , as it allows us to analyze quantum dots in terms of their envelope functions rather than their wavefunctions .",
    "the approximation is a natural one , based on the large separation of lengths scales:@xcite atomic ( @xmath630.1  nm ) vs.  confinement ( 10 - 100  nm )",
    ". one could expect the approximation to break down when the confinement potential is sharp , since the two length scales are then comparable .",
    "however , the effective mass approximation remains viable for many materials , including silicon , even near an abrupt interface.@xcite this is because the valleys are roughly parabolic in the regions of the brillouin zone where the wavefunction is concentrated .",
    "valley coupling is therefore a higher order effect in the effective mass approximation .",
    "a confinement potential with components at large @xmath64 will couple the valleys in silicon , leading to an envelope function equation of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : envelope ] ) , where the leading order approximation for the coupling takes the form of a @xmath30-function , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfn2 ] ) .",
    "when the interface is aligned with the crystallographic axes , the interface position @xmath65 is a constant .",
    "this leads to our first selection rule , that a sharp interface always causes inter - valley coupling within a given orbital .",
    "we note however , that even if the effective mass approximation were to break down near a sharp interface , the valley degeneracy would still be lifted , as confirmed by atomistic theories.@xcite comparison between atomistic and effective mass theories generally confirms the effective mass approach.@xcite in the absence of any interfacial tilt , the valley coupling is strictly intra - orbital .",
    "this is a consequence of the assumed separation of variables in the confinement potential , which forms an excellent approximation in quasi-2d devices.@xcite    when the interface is not aligned with the crystallographic axes , we have chosen to treat the interface as smoothly tilted , since single atomic steps are much smaller than effective mass length scales .",
    "the approximation leads immediately to our second selection rule , that a tilted interface causes inter - orbital coupling between opposing valleys , @xmath26 and @xmath66 .",
    "of course , the smooth interface approximation will not be valid if the misalignment is highly non - uniform , as in the case of multiple step bunching . in the appendix",
    ", we consider several scenarios where the smooth interface approximation breaks down , most notably in cases involving wide steps .",
    "for very wide steps , the smooth approximation leads to a very weak valley coupling .",
    "a more accurate treatment , taking into account the relaxation mechanism described in appendix  a.1 , would suppress the valley coupling even beyond the predictions of the present theory .",
    "we now analyze some specific geometries .",
    "we first consider the case where the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the sample . because the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions are now inequivalent , even in the absence of interfacial steps , the angular momentum quantum number @xmath67 is not a good quantum number .",
    "we initially treat the problem as an anisotropic 3d simple harmonic oscillator , with lateral confinement frequencies @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in the most general case , we assume the oscillator frequencies are unequal : @xmath70 . the quantum well confinement potential is also taken to be parabolic , with @xmath71 . because of the strong confinement along @xmath72 , the quantum dot wavefunction is approximately separable in the variable @xmath2 , despite the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , we will find that the wavefunction acquires an intrinsic phase when the interface is tilted , due to valley coupling . since the magnetic field also produces a non - trivial phase , which could potentially lead to interference effects ,",
    "it is important to work through the details of the problem without assuming separability , _ a priori_.    we take the magnetic field to be oriented along one of the major elliptical axes ( @xmath73 ) , otherwise the problem becomes intractable .",

    "( [ eq : egperpcirc ] ) ] . in a quantum point contact , valley splitting",
    "is significantly enhanced due to lateral confinement.@xcite in a si / sige two - electron quantum dot , a large singlet - triplet splitting between 0.1 and 0.3  mev has been measured at zero - field.@xcite since the triplet state involves an excited single - electron orbital , the singlet - triplet splitting provides a good estimate of the ground state gap .",
    "this solitary data point is therefore consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : bfield](b ) . due to valley - orbit coupling",
    ", it is not appropriate to identify the splitting as purely orbital - like or valley - like .",
    "however , small gaps of any type are anathema for qubit operations .",
    "the large value of the measured gap implies an acceptable splitting for qubit applications.@xcite in future experiments , it would be desirable to perform excited state spectroscopy in similar dots , as a function of magnetic field .",
    "the present theory would then allow the valley coupling and other quantum dot confinement parameters to be determined .    in this paper",
    ", we have paid special attention to the inter - orbital valley coupling .",
    "the origin of this coupling can be understood in terms of the dot shape . according to the variational principle",
    ", a quantum dot will minimize its ground state energy by maximizing its valley splitting . in our perturbation theory",
    ", the ground state will therefore mix with asymmetric excited states that allow it to squeeze along the direction of the step gradient .",
    "the mixing occurs only between opposing valley states , @xmath26 and @xmath66 , whose coupling is the source of valley splitting .",
    "the inter - orbital component of valley coupling has not been emphasized previously . in quantum information applications",
    ", it leads to a potential source of decoherence for spin qubits .",
    "when phonons are present , valley scattering can occur in a process analogous to spin flip transitions.@xcite two separate ingredients are needed to flip a spin by a phonon:@xcite spin - orbit coupling ( to mix spin states via the excited orbitals ) and a magnetic field ( to lift the kramers degeneracy ) .",
    "valley scattering can occur in the presence of two analogous processes : valley - orbit coupling at a tilted interface ( to mix valley states via the excited orbitals ) and a sharp confinement potential ( to lift the valley degeneracy ) .    in the context of quantum computing",
    ", valley scattering does not directly affect the spin state or lead to spin decoherence .",
    "however , there is an indirect spin effect , mediated by the pauli principle , which depends on the valley coupling .",
    "the predominant two - spin gate interaction is the exchange coupling,@xcite which occurs because any two electrons must have different quantum numbers .",
    "when the valley degree of freedom is introduced , the size of the hilbert space doubles , providing an opportunity for an electron to  leak \" into a non - qubit sector via valley scattering .",
    "if this happens , the electron will have a different quantum number , and the exchange coupling will be ineffective .",
    "the spin state is then uncontrollable . aside from this mechanism ,",
    "a direct spin - valley coupling has also been predicted for si 2degs , with a magnitude comparable to the spin - orbit coupling.@xcite we do not consider this effect here .    finally , we note that the results obtained in this paper were obtained by assuming a smooth , uniformly tilted interface .",
    "we expect such results to pertain to more general situations .",
    "however , step disorder and discreteness can both have a quantitative effect on the valley splitting . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss several experimental conditions that are inconsistent with our approximations , including : ( i ) step discreteness , which becomes important for widely separated steps ; inhomogeneous tilting , which affects ( ii ) the quantum dot confinement potential and ( iii ) the delicate phenomenon of destructive interference in the valley coupling ; ( iv ) step bunching , which also tends to moderate the destructive interference .",
    "since all of these phenomena enhance the valley splitting , we can treat them , phenomenologically , through an effective tilt angle @xmath36 that is smaller than the nominal tilt .    in the absence of any detailed knowledge of the interfacial disorder",
    ", @xmath36 must remain a phenomenological parameter .",
    "however , the relation between the average tilt and the effective tilt , and the dependence on different forms of disorder , remains an important topic for future investigation .",
    "for example , the energy levels of a si double quantum dot could potentially be measured as a function of magnetic field by the method of ref .  .",
    "comparison with the present theory can then provide information about @xmath36 .",
    "more intriguingly perhaps , it may be possible to use gating methods to shift the center of a dot , and thereby map out @xmath36 as a function of position .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have developed a theory of valley coupling in realistic quantum dots .",
    "the resulting energy spectra exhibit crossings and anti - crossings , as a function of the interfacial tilt angle and magnetic field . due to valley - orbit coupling ,",
    "the ground state gap is not strictly orbital - like or valley - like , except in certain limiting cases . for quantum dots of interest in quantum computing",
    ", we find that inter - valley orbital coupling plays an important role in device operation , and in determining the ground state gap .",

    "this appendix addresses the approximations made in the main text that enable analytic solutions to be obtained , and it discusses the conditions under which they apply .",
    "the main approximations are that : ( 1 ) the interfacial tilt can be treated as continuous and the presence of individual atomic steps can be ignored , and ( 2 ) the disorder in the step locations can be ignored .",
    "the first approximation suggests that there will be no relaxation of the electron wavefunction to conform to the pattern of steps at the interface .",
    "the second approximation is equivalent to assuming the interfacial tilt is smooth and uniform .      in this work ,",
    "we treat the interface as continuous and we ignore the presence of individual atomic steps .",
    "naively , one would expect such an approximation to be reasonable because the step is much smaller than the characteristic size of the envelope function .",
    "for example , the height of a single atomic step along [ 001 ] is @xmath259   , while a quantum dot may extend over 10 s of nm .",
    "energy arguments suggest that such an argument breaks down when the interface tilt angle is small . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kohn ] ) , we have taken the complex phase difference between @xmath260 and @xmath261 to be a constant , independent of the lateral position .",
    "the global value of the phase difference is determined by minimizing the ground state energy for the whole quantum dot , according to degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "since the optimal value of the phase difference depends on the interface position @xmath42 , it is clear that valley coupling can not be optimized simultaneously on both sides of a step while the phase remains constant . by allowing the phase to vary",
    ", we can reduce this valley coupling energy penalty , but we pay a price in kinetic energy .",
    "careful energy balance calculations show that phase relaxation becomes favorable when @xmath262 . in the present work",
    ", phase relaxation would tend to reduce valley - orbit mixing .",
    "step disorder causes non - uniform tilting of the interface , and leads to spatial variations of the valley splitting and the quantum dot confinement potential .",
    "the position of the electron will shift when the local curvature of the valley splitting is larger than the curvature of the electrostatic potential .",
    "the net effect of the shift is to reduce the effective tilt angle .      for highly uniform step distributions ,",
    "the suppression of the valley coupling by valley phase interference is very effective .",
    "however , this interference effect is somewhat delicate .",
    "the reduction of symmetry by step disorder can lead to an order of magnitude increase in the valley splitting.@xcite related effects are also observed in the presence of alloy disorder in the sige quantum well barriers.@xcite while step disorder tends to reduce the effective tilt angle,@xcite the net effect of alloy disorder appears to be more complicated.@xcite      interfacial steps may become bunched due to randomness , or as a consequence of strained growth.@xcite the suppression of valley splitting , as discussed in this paper , is particularly effective for single - atom steps , as compared to bunched steps .",
    "we can understand this as follows . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kohn ] ) and the related discussion , the phase difference between the @xmath2 valleys for a flat interface is @xmath263 . at a step of height @xmath264",
    ", we see that @xmath265 , so the phase difference suddenly changes by @xmath266 .",
    "since the two sides of the step are almost fully out of phase , there is a significant suppression of the total valley splitting . on the other hand ,",
    "a two - fold bunched step of height @xmath267 has a much milder effect on the valley coupling .",
    "in fact , the first step geometry with a stronger effect on the valley coupling is a six - fold bunched step . in this sense ,",
    "single - atom steps are essentially a worst - case scenario , leading to maximal suppression of the valley splitting .",
    "the dependence of the effective tilt angle on step bunching is therefore rather complicated .      to summarize",
    ", the assumption that the steps can be treated as continuous is expected to be valid , but valley phase relaxation and variability in the step density both serve to modify the effective tilt angle of the interface . assuming that an appropriate effective tilt angle is used , we expect our analytical expressions to provide an accurate depiction of the valley coupling for typical quantum dot geometries .",
    "our results therefore provide a useful first approximation for understanding the valley coupling .",
    "several numerical results confirm this point of view.@xcite    to obtain a quantitative estimate for the valley coupling , one must know the effective interfacial tilt angle @xmath36 . for the reasons described above",
    ", the effective tilt depends in a nontrivial way on the average tilt angle , the disorder in the step configuration , and the materials properties of the interface .",
    "a quantitative calculation of @xmath36 is particularly challenging , since the dependence of the valley coupling on the tilt angle is exponential , so that errors and fluctuations in the tilt angle are essentially magnified .",
    "for example , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : varthetas ] ) , an exponential suppression of the valley coupling was predicted for tilt angles larger than @xmath268 , based on realistic dot parameters .",
    "experimentally , a large valley splitting has been observed for wavefunctions in a quantum point contact with a @xmath269 miscut@xcite and in quantum dots in samples with nominal tilt angles approaching @xmath269(ref .  )  evidence that the effective tilt in these devices is significantly smaller than the nominal tilt .",
