    "the concept of fidelity was originally introduced by peres @xcite to characterize the quantum - mechanical stability of a system against perturbations .",
    "recently it enjoys a renewed popularity because of its obvious relevance for quantum computing . in the present context",
    "the works which focus on random matrix aspects are of particular relevance . first the paper by gorin et al .",
    "@xcite has to be mentioned where the gaussian average of the decay of the fidelity amplitude was calculated in linear response approximation .",
    "for small perturbations the authors found a predominantly gaussian decay , with a cross - over to exponential decay for strong perturbations , in accordance with literature @xcite .",
    "the results of the paper could be experimentally verified in an ultrasound experiment @xcite and in a microwave billiard @xcite .",
    "using supersymmetry techniques , the limitations of the linear response approximation could be overcome , yielding analytic expressions for the decay of the fidelity amplitude for the gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) and gaussian unitary ( gue ) ensemble .",
    "quite surprisingly a recovery of the fidelity was found at the heisenberg time @xcite which was interpreted as a spectral analogue of an debye - waller factor @xcite .",
    "reference is the basis for the present work .",
    "the gaussian decay observed for small perturbation is caused by the diagonal part of the perturbation in the eigenbasis of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "this was the motivation for prosen and nidari to look for perturbations with zero diagonal , first in classically integrable systems @xcite .",
    "later on they extended there studies to classically chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "in linear response approximation they found an plateau in the decay of the fidelity . only after extraordinarily long times the decay started again , exponentially below , and gaussian beyond the heisenberg time .",
    "it remained , however , an open question whether this freeze of the fidelity is reality or whether it is just an artifact of the approximation .",
    "it was the motivation for the present work to answer this question by extending the previous supersymmetry calculation to the freeze situation .",
    "it will be shown that the freeze is present also in the exact calculation .",
    "this may have important consequences for quantum computing . if one succeeds in imbedding the atoms representing the qbits into an environment coupled only via an off - diagonal perturbation to the atoms , an enhancement of the system s stability by orders of magnitude",
    "is expected .",
    "the present results are not restricted to random matrices . in reference",
    "@xcite it is shown that , e.g. , kicked tops with a corresponding dynamics follow exactly the random matrix predictions of the present paper .",
    "the fidelity amplitude is defined as the overlap integral of an initial wave function @xmath0 with itself after the time evolution due to two slightly different hamiltonians @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,    @xmath3    where the time @xmath4 is given in units of the heisenberg time . for chaotic systems",

    ". the range of validity of the linear response approximation can be somewhat extended , by exponentiating eq .",
    "( [ l04 ] ) , @xmath18 the authors argued that the errors of the approximation should be fairly small for @xmath19 and negligible for@xmath20 ( corresponding to @xmath21 and 0.004 , respectively ) , which was fully confirmed by the exact calculations @xcite .",
    "the gaussian decay for small perturbations is caused by the diagonal part of the perturbation .",

    "this suggests to consider perturbations with vanishing diagonal matrix elements in the eigenbasis of @xmath1 @xcite . in the linear response approximation one",
    "then obtains @xmath25 where @xmath26 differs from the expression ( [ l05 ] ) derived previously only by the fact that the term @xmath27 is missing on the right hand side of the equation @xcite .",
    "the resulting decay of the fidelity amplitude is extremely slow .",
    "it will be discussed below and compared with the exact result as obtained from the supersymmetry calculation .",
    "to apply the supersymmetric technique of reference the hamiltonian needs to be invariant under the action of the orthogonal / unitary group .",
    "this is not the case for a goe perturbation with a deleted diagonal .",
    "however a purely imaginary antisymmetric matrix meets with both requirements , zero diagonal elements and orthogonal symmetry .",
    "therefore it is an ideal candidate .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath1 is taken from the goe , i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath8 is real antisymmetric , i.e. @xmath30 the variance of the matrix elements has been chosen to have a mean level spacing of one for @xmath1 and of order @xmath31 for @xmath8 .",
    "note that in contrast to reference the mean density of states does not remain constant with increasing perturbation , but decreases with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "in fact it is irrelevant in the present context , whether a defolding to a constant mean density of states is performed or not .",
    "such a defolding would imply an additional factor of @xmath33 on the right hand side of equation ( [ a01 ] ) , which in the final limit @xmath34 reduces to one .",
