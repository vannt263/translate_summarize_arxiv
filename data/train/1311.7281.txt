    "gravity is supposed to be the only dominant force at large distances during the present epoch . according to this and due to several puzzles concerning the evolution of the universe ( for instance dark energy , dark matter and so on )",
    ", it is reasonable to consider that we might have not fully understood it on a cosmological scale .",
    "+ the first attempts to modify the einstein s gravity go back in 1919 , when weyl @xcite added a quadratic term in the weyl tensor to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "later many authors gave attention to modifications of the gravitational theory , for example eddington @xcite , lanczos , bach , schrodinger and then buchdahl @xcite that analyzed the actions considering singularity free oscillating cosmology . in the 1960 s in the context of quantum gravity",
    "the einstein s lagrangian was modified introducing terms containing higher orders of the scalar curvature @xcite .",
    "+ very interesting classes of extended gravity are the so called `` @xmath0 theories '' , coming from a direct generalization of the einstein s lagrangian ( for complete reviews see and references therein ) . among these",
    ", @xmath0 gravity seems to be an interesting model that is relatively simple and it may have many applications in astrophysics , cosmology and high energy phenomena .",
    "the paradigm consists of adding higher order curvature invariants .",
    "the simplest modification of gravity which still preserves all the symmetries of general relativity ( gr ) consists of the extension of einstein - hilbert action @xmath2 where instead of @xmath3 , the ricci scalar curvature , an arbitrary function @xmath0 is present , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is determinant of the metric @xmath6 . from a conceptual point of view we have no a priori reason to consider the gravitational lagrangian as a linear function of ricci scalar r. from the technical point of view , this way to proceed directly allows us to write field equations in order to compare them with gr ones .",
    "moreover , they are directly related to scalar - tensor theories by a peculiar conformal transformation of the metric involving a scalar field @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this way to proceed gives field equations which are also ghost free .",
    "+ it has been established that our universe is undergoing an accelerated phase .",
    "indeed a series of observations based on supernovae type ia can be explained by the accelerated expansion of the universe . within the mathematical framework of the gr and the idea that our cosmo is homogeneous and isotropic",
    ", the scientists assume that this acceleration is due to some kind of negative pressure form due to `` dark energy '' .",
    "cosmologists have proposed many models of dark energy but those models have many free parameters and constraints from observational data .",
    "this discovery has revolutionized modern cosmology .",
    "there are many explanations and theoretical models in literature , for example quintessence , k - essence , chaplygin gas ... and so on .",
    "the simple explanation for the universe s accelerated expansion is a cosmological constant , @xmath8 , that is to say a nonzero vacuum energy that drives the acceleration of the universe . from a observational viewpoint",
    "it is important to say that @xmath8cdm model of the universe is in agreement with data coming from observations . but this model shows incongruences and is `` unnatural '' , because poses important theoretical questions : what is the reason why the nonzero vacuum energy should drive the acceleration ?",
    "why is the cosmological constant so small ?",
    "this is known as `` cosmological constant problem '' and it is a fundamental problem in cosmology and physics .",
    "in other terms the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remain unknown and a real mystery .",
    "+ for a resolution to this problem we invoke the class of @xmath0 theories . for sure , this is just a particular class of extended gravity theories .",
    "some different interesting approaches have been studied in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless recent research has shown a plausible alternative to this picture , in fact it has been shown that such cases lead to an effective dark energy ; in other terms these models mimic the accelerated expansion of the universe by a modification of general relativity that converts the attractive gravity into a repulsive interaction on cosmological scales .",
    "if we consider a small correction to the einstein - hilbert action , for example , by adding an @xmath9 term , we have an acceleration of the universe because of the @xmath9 term which is able to dominate as the hubble parameter decreases .",
    "this theory shows @xcite that there is an equivalence with scalar - tensor gravity without scalar kinetic term .",
    "it is important to say that this connection to scalar - tensor gravity is provided by a conformal transformation connecting the einstein frame and the jordan one and is valid for all extended theories of gravity that have an action with @xmath0 , a function of ricci scalar in which @xmath0 has nonzero second derivate with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "these @xmath0 models contain higher order gravity terms that may be the cause of the acceleration of the universe . + in other terms , modifying general relativity allows us to eliminate the dark energy , but this approach does not explain the minuscule value of vacuum energy .",
    "it is also important to stress that we do nt know the exact functional form of the lagrangian , therefore it is necessary to test theoretical considerations with observational data .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we report the well - know derivation of the modified field equations in @xmath0 gravity ; in sec .",
    "iii we focus on perturbed lagrangian ; in sec .",

    "v we study our model in relation to the apparent acceleration of the universe .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section we report the standard way @xcite to obtain the modified equations in @xmath0 gravity . we start from a theory described by the lagrangian density @xmath10 and we apply the variational principle @xmath11 .",

    "therefore , we are allowed to fix 40 initial conditions , in order to have a well defined solvable problem .",
    "we already fixed 20 of them by requiring that @xmath37 so we are still left with 20 conditions , that are not enough to completely eliminate the boundary terms .",
    "in fact , in eq.([eq : border_variation ] ) , we have 80 degrees of freedom . in gr ( @xmath38 )",
    "the boundary contribution can be eliminated by adding the well - know york - gibbons - hawking action : @xmath39 where @xmath40 in the induced metric on the boundary , and @xmath41 is the extrinsic curvature of the boundary hypersurface .",

    "in addition , @xmath44 is a symmetric tensor , so that the requirement @xmath45 on the boundary can be used to impose the additional 20 initial conditions allowing us to completely solve the bulk equations : @xmath46 before concluding this section , let us notice that @xmath47 ; in other words , the total contributions on the boundary can be rewritten as a scalar degree of freedom , using the well - know equivalence between @xmath1 gravity and scalar - tensor theory @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : solution2 ] ) .",
    "notice that we used the hubble parameter s value determined by planck , in order to ( possibly ) reduce the tension of the @xmath102 determination between the cmb observations and the snia ones .",
    "in this context there is no need of introducing a dark energy component in order to explain supernovae data : in fact , fitting the data released by union 2 we have found that the experimental points in the hubble diagram can be accurately described also by model presented in this paper . + in conclusion we want to stress that this work offers a possible explanation of the apparent acceleration of the universe as a consequence of a dynamical approach in which we consider a perturbed general relativity solution , based on a modified gravitational theory , without introducing cosmological constant and/or dark energy .",
    "therefore it is possible that the usually claimed acceleration effect is not the manifestation of an increase of the expansion velocity , but rather the first signal of a gravitational lagrangian different from the einstein - hilbert lagrangian . from a philosophical point of view",
    "the core of the problem is that we have a limited number of cosmological tests available , in order to discriminate among different theories candidate to explain the observed universe .",
