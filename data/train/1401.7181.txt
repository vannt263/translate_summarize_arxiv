    "laser cooling and trapping neutral atoms with a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) has become an important step in a successful production of ultracold quantum gases  @xcite . to improve the capture efficiency of a mot",
    ", a number of slowers were invented to slow hot atoms before they overlap with the mot  @xcite .",
    "atoms and a resonant laser beam counter propagate in a slower .",
    "the longitudinal velocity and corresponding doppler shift of these atoms decrease after they absorb resonant photons .",
    "after a few such absorptions , these slowed atoms are no longer resonant with the laser beam and thus can not be further slowed down . in order to continuously slow atoms along the laser beam path",
    ", one can vary the laser frequency accordingly as with the frequency chirp method  @xcite or by using broadband lasers  @xcite .",
    "another widely - used method is to compensate differences in the doppler shift with a spatially varying magnetic field generated by a zeeman slower while keeping the laser frequency unchanged  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present the design and construction of a spin - flip zeeman slower controlled by a fast feedback circuit for a sodium bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) apparatus .",
    "an efficient method of optimizing a slower with our simulation program and by monitoring the number of atoms trapped in the mot is also explained .",
    "in addition , our data demonstrates how the efficiency of a slower strongly depends on a few of its intrinsic parameters , such as the intensity of the slowing laser beam and the length of each section in the slower .",
    "these findings result in a simple three - step procedure of designing an optimal zeeman slower for neutral atoms , especially for those atomic species with high initial velocities , for example lithium atoms .",
    "a sodium beam is created by an oven consisting of a half nipple and an elbow flange .",
    "a double - sided flange with a 6  mm diameter hole in the center is used to collimate the atomic beam . to collect scattered atoms , a cold plate with a 9  mm diameter center hole",
    "is placed before a spin - flip zeeman slower and kept at 10 @xmath0c with a peltier cooler .",
    "our multi - layer slower has three different sections along the @xmath1 axis ( i.e. , a decreasing - field section , a spin - flip section , and an increasing - field section ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ theory](a ) . compared with the single - layer zeeman slower with variable pitch coils  @xcite",
    ", this multi - layer design provides us enormous flexibilities in creating large enough @xmath2 for slowing atoms with high initial velocities ( e.g. , sodium and lithium atoms ) .",
    "the first section of our zeeman slower produces a magnetic field with decreasing magnetic field strength @xmath2 .",
    "we choose @xmath3 gauss at the entrance of the slower , so the slowing beam only needs to be red - detuned by @xmath4 of a few hundred mhz from the d2 line of @xmath5na atoms .",
    "this frequency detuning is easily achieved with an acousto - optic modulator , but is still large enough to avoid perturbing the mot .",
    "the spin - flip section is simply a bellow as to maintain @xmath6 for atoms to be fully re - polarized and also to damp out mechanical vibrations generated by vacuum pumps .",
    "the increasing - field section creates a magnetic field with increasing @xmath2 but in the opposite direction to that of the decreasing - field section , which ensures the magnetic field quickly dies off outside the slower .",
    "this slower can thus be placed close to the mot , which results in more atoms being captured .",
    "the mot setup is similar to that of our previous work  @xcite and its maximum capture velocity @xmath7 is @xmath8  50  m / s .",
    "to precisely adjust @xmath2 inside the slower , all layers of magnetic coils are divided into four groups , and different layers in each group are connected in series and controlled by one fast feedback circuit . a standard ring - down circuit consisting of a resistor and a diode is also connected in parallel with each coil for safely shutting off the inductive current in the coil .",
    "an important chip in our control circuit is a high power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor ( mosfet ) operated in the linear mode .",
    "we use a number of mosfets connected in parallel and mount them on the top of a water - cooled cold plate to efficiently cool them .",
    "a carefully chosen resistor r@xmath9 of 50  m@xmath10 is connected to each mosfet s source terminal to encourage equal current splitting among the mosfets in parallel .",
    "r@xmath9 also limits mosfet s transconductance to a narrow range , which enables our feedback circuit to control both low and high electric currents with a single set of gains .",

    "@xmath24 , the number of atoms in a mot , can also be boosted by a larger atomic flux with a hotter atomic oven . however , this is generally not a favorable method due to two reasons .",
    "first , a hotter oven generates atoms with higher initial average velocities , but a slower can only handle entering atoms of a certain maximum velocity .",
    "second , alkali metals consumption rates sharply increase with the oven temperature .",
    "we find that convenient parameters to adjust are slowing beam s intensity @xmath25 and frequency detuning @xmath4 , electric current @xmath26 in each magnetic coil , and the length of each section of the slower .",
    "these parameters , however , can not be optimized independently since there is a strong correlation among them . in order to efficiently optimize the slower , we developed a computer program to simulate @xmath21 and compared the simulation results to the actual magnetic field strengths in the slower under many different conditions ( e.g. , at various values of @xmath26 ) .",
