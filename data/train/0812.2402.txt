    "the theory of jacobian elliptic functions , for reference see @xcite , yields a complete calculation for the motion of a pendulum as a function of time .",
    "this is revisited here , to exhibit a few interesting properties of the elliptic integrals .",
    "write the pendulum energy , with inertia moment @xmath0 and gravity constant @xmath1 ( rather than the usual @xmath2 ) , in the canonical coordinates @xmath3 or as -i g^2(1-)h(b,)where the origin in @xmath4 is set at the unstable equilibrium : the definition implies that @xmath2 has dimension of inverse time and the lyapunov exponents of the unstable equilibrium are @xmath5 . @xmath6 and @xmath4 are canonical coordinates for the motions .",
    "it is well known that near the unstable equilibrium of the pendulum @xmath7 it is possible to define a canonical transformation , mapping the origin into itself , introducing new local cordinates @xmath8 such that    b = r_c(p , q),=s_c(p , q)with @xmath9 holomorphic in a polidisk @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and in terms of which the motion near @xmath12 is described by a hamiltonian @xmath13 depending on the product @xmath14 only , of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the purpose of this note is to derive a proof of the latter statement via the theory of elliptic functions : this is not the simplest approach if one is just interested to know the existence of normal hyperbolic coordinates : existence of @xmath9 could be easily established without deriving their `` explicit '' expressions for @xmath17 and @xmath18 in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "here we also correct a few errors in the earlier attempt made in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 9 ) .    the natural correspondence between the hyperbolic fixed point of the pendulum and its elliptic fixed point is briefly reported in appendix b and leads to the construction of the normal canonical coordinates for the small oscillations , hence to the action - angle variables .",
    "motions near the unstable equilibrium have a quite different nature depending on the sign of the total energy @xmath19 : the ones with @xmath20 are `` oscillations '' ( their motions do not encompass the full perimeter of the circle ) while the ones with @xmath21 are `` librations '' .",
    "therefore it will not be possible to find global action - angle coordinates : motions near the separatrix ( which with our conventions has @xmath22 ) require other coordinates to be expressed in a simple way .",
    "introduce the variables that appear in the theory of jacobi s elliptic functions    where , @xmath23 .",
    "hence the separatrix has @xmath24 and @xmath22 ; and the data _ above the separatrix _ correspond to @xmath21 ( or @xmath25 ) .",
    "note that @xmath26 because @xmath27 ( as @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) ; the following formulae become singular as @xmath30 , but the singularity is only apparent and it will disappear from all relevant formulae derived or used in the following .",

    "it is also convenient to remark that in a motion with energy @xmath44 it will be    h(b(t),(t))u=2 g^2 i",
    "from the theory of elliptic functions the evolution @xmath45 with any initial data _ above the separatrix _ ( _ i.e. _ with @xmath46 and @xmath47 corresponding to a given value of @xmath48 , with @xmath21 ) , can be expressed as @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 and , taking into account ( * ? ? ?",

    "( ) provides a convergent expansion of the solution .",
    "motions with initial coordinate @xmath67 also admit a rather simple representation .",
    "remark that all pendulum motions with @xmath68 ( hence different from the two equilibria ) pass at some time through a phase space point with @xmath35 .",

    "the convergence requires @xmath80 : which represents many data , in particular those in the vicinity of the separatrix .",
    "the coordinates can be called `` hyperbolic '' being suitable to describe motions near the separatrix ( where @xmath81 ) .",
    "we also see that time evolution preserves both volume elements @xmath82 and @xmath83 ; which means that the jacobian determinant @xmath84 must be a function constant over the trajectories , hence a function @xmath85 of @xmath86 .",
    "note that @xmath85 has dimension of an action .",
    "it is then possible to change coordinates setting @xmath87 and choose @xmath88 so that the jacobian determinant for @xmath89 is @xmath90 .",

    "all @xmath107-derivatives of @xmath119 have the same dimension as @xmath112 .",
