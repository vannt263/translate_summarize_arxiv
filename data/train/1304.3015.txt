    "the unified model for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) proposes the ubiquitous presence of obscuring tori around their nuclei , with type 1 and type 2 agn being intrinsically similar ( @xcite ) . the infrared ( ir ) range ( and particularly the mid - ir )",
    "is key to characterize the torus , since dust reprocesses the optical and ultraviolet radiation generated in the accretion process and re - emits it in this range .",
    "however , considering the small torus size ( @xmath2 pc in the case of seyfert galaxies ) , high angular resolution turns to be essential to isolate as much as possible its emission . during the last two decades much progress has been made towards understanding the properties of the molecular dusty torus . for example",
    ", some authors assumed a uniform dust density distribution to simplify the modeling ( @xcite , @xcite ) . to solve the various discrepancies between observations and models , an intensive search for an alternative torus geometry",
    "has been carried out in the last years .",
    "the clumpy torus models propose that the dust is distributed in clumps , instead of homogeneously filling the torus volume ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these models are making significant progress in accounting for the mir emission of agn ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "little is known about the extent of the mir emission in qsos , the distribution of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) features detected in recent spitzer spectroscopy ( @xcite ) , and whether the unresolved emission is entirely due to dust - reprocessing by dusty tori as those detected in other types of agn .",
    "thus , it is important to characterize the emission of the brightest nearby qsos in the mir .",
    "mrk 1383 ( @xmath3 ) is part of a sample of 15 nearby qsos being observed with canaricam on the 10.4 m gran telescopio de canarias ( gtc ) in spain , to study the prevalence of dusty tori and the significance and location of starbursts ( sbs ) around powerful agn .",
    "the sample was selected by redshift ( @xmath4 ) and ir brightness @xmath5 mjy in order to secure detections at high angular - resolution ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "additionally , we require that objects in our sample have the highest x - ray luminosities among agn ( @xmath7(@xmath8 kev ) @xmath9 erg / s ) .",
    "mrk 1383 was imaged in march 2012 with the 10.4 m gtc at 8.7 and 20 @xmath10 m , with a precipitable water vapor @xmath11 mm .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the canaricam pipeline of @xcite , and the images were flux calibrated with infrared standard stars from the cohen s catalogue ( @xcite ) .",

    "with the aim of looking for extended emission in mrk 1383 we did aperture photometry on the target image using the phot / iraf task varying the aperture from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and compared it to the aperture photometry of the standard star . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the radial profiles of the star acquired in 3 consecutive exposures and compare these with the radial profile of the galaxy .",
    "the radial profiles are very similar and we conclude that mrk 1383 does not have prominent extended emission within the inner @xmath15 and , therefore , its emission is mostly unresolved . to construct a well - sampled ir sed ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , we compile near - ir high spatial resolution nuclear fluxes from the literature .",
    "the flux at 20 @xmath10 m is larger than the flux from the spitzer spectrum and the photometry obtain with ukirt at the same wavelength .",
