    "two definitions of an affine space are known : it is a projective space with one of its hyperplanes removed , or it is a projective space with one of its hyperplanes distinguished .",
    "it is also known that these two definitions are equivalent , since the removed hyperplane can be recovered in terms of so obtained affine space .",
    "a general question arises : how big the remaining fragment of a projective space must be so as the surrounding space can be recovered in terms of the internal geometry of this fragment ?",
    "analogous question could be asked in the context of projective grassmannians . in this paper",
    "we propose a solution involving parallelism , imitating the affine parallelism , valid under certain assumptions on the size of improper parts of lines .",
    "our solution is just _ a _ solution : there are fragments of projective spaces ( e.g. ruled quadrics ) which do not satisfy our requirements and from which the surrounding spaces are recoverable , but with completely different methods",
    ".      in this paper we deal with a point - line space @xmath0 where a subset @xmath1 of points , a horizon , and those lines that are entirely contained in @xmath1 are removed .",
    "we call such a reduct of @xmath0 the complement of @xmath1 in @xmath0 and denote it by @xmath2 . as for which lines to remove from @xmath0 our approach is not unique and there are different complements considered in the literature , e.g.  in @xcite , where all the lines that meet @xmath1 are deleted",
    ".    the most classic and vivid example of a complement @xmath2 , aforementioned at the beginning , is an affine space i.e.  the complement of a hyperplane @xmath1 in a projective space @xmath0 .",
    "there are more examples where removing a hyperplane is also successful and where in result we get some affine geometries . in a polar space deleting its geometric hyperplane yields an affine polar space ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in a grassmann space , in other words",
    ", in a space of pencils , this construction produces an affine grassmannian ( cf .",
    "when @xmath1 is any subspace , not necessarily a hyperplane , in a projective space @xmath0 , then so called slit space arises as the complement @xmath2 possessing both projective and affine properties ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) there is introduced an axiom system of semiaffine partial linear spaces ( sapls in short ) that are , without going into details , weak geometries with parallelism .",
    "it is astonishing that the set of directions of lines in a sapls form a subspace @xmath1 of some projective space @xmath0 so , we can treat this sapls as the complement @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , it is proved in @xcite , that the class of semiaffine linear spaces coincides with the class of forementioned slit spaces .",
    "in other words , semiaffine linear spaces are slit spaces with parallelism that is not necessarily reflexive .",
    "another remarkable example is a spine space ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , that emerges from a grassmann space over a vector space by taking only those points which as @xmath3-dimensional vector subspaces meet a fixed vector subspace @xmath4 in a fixed dimension @xmath5 . in case @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath3 is the codimension of @xmath4 we get a pretty well known space of linear complements ( cf . @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "now we turn back to our major question : is it possible to recover the underlying space @xmath0 and the horizon @xmath1 in the complement @xmath2 ?",
    "this is not a completely new question and there are some papers devoted to such recovery problem . in @xcite",
    "projective grassmannians are successfully recovered from complements of their grassmann substructures .",
    "the concept of two - hole slit space is introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is a point - line space whose point set is the complement of the set of points of two fixed complementary subspaces , not hyperplanes , in a projective space and the line set is the set of all those lines which do not intersect any of these two subspaces .",
    "this is not exactly what we have used to call a complement as lines are taken differently .",
    "nevertheless , using very similar methods to ours the recovery problem has been solved here in incidence geometry settings .",
    "it has been also solved in chain geometry associated with a linear group approach . in @xcite a partial linear space with parallelism embeddable in an affine space with the same point set is studied . on the other hand",
    ", it can be considered as an affine space with some lines deleted .",
    "as it was mentioned , an affine space is a complement of a projective space , and thus there is a correspondence between @xcite and our research . to restore missing lines ( and preserve parallelism )",
    "the authors introduce some additional combinatorial condition .",
    "namely , all investigations in @xcite are done under assumption , that on every line @xmath3 , for any point @xmath7 , there is more points collinear with @xmath8 than those not collinear with @xmath8 .",
    "likewise , we require that on every line of @xmath2 there is less points of @xmath1 than the other .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an answer to the above question for projective spaces and grassmann spaces where a set of points , under some restrictions , has been removed . in the first part we focus on a projective space as @xmath0 .",
    "purely in terms of the complement of @xmath1 in @xmath0 we reconstruct the removed points and lines as well as the relevant incidence .",
    "an affirmative answer to our question is given in theorem  [ thm : main - proj ] .",
    "in the second part we investigate a grassmann space as @xmath0 .",
    "it is known that every maximal strong subspace of a grassmann space is a projective space .",
    "this , together with some additional assumptions , lets us apply the result obtained for projective spaces to recover the whole @xmath0 and its horizon @xmath1 in terms of the complement @xmath2 . that way another affirmative answer to our question",
    "is formulated in theorem  [ thm : main - grass ] .    at the end",
