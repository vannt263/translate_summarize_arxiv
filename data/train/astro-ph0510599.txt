    "early - type galaxies can host hundreds to many thousands of globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "the properties of gc systems provide important clues about the formation and evolutionary history of their host galaxy .",
    "this motivation has prompted numerous imaging studies of early - type galaxy gc systems over the years .",
    "imaging of gc systems began with wide - area photographic plates which defined the global structural properties of gc systems ( see harris & racine 1979 ) .",
    "ccd imaging lead to improvements in photometry and the first detections of colour bimodality .",
    "however , ccds suffered from a small field - of - view so studies were often limited to the central regions , in addition contamination from background galaxies and foreground stars was a significant issue under 1 arcsec seeing conditions harris ( 1991 ) .",
    "the introduction of the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) camera on the hubble space telescope had a large impact on gc studies .",
    "its high spatial resolution meant that it effectively identified gcs out to virgo - like distances , hence reducing contamination levels to near zero .",
    "accurate photometry led to colour bimodality detections in the gc systems of many / most early - type galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ; larsen et al .",
    "2001 ; kundu & whitmore 2001 ) . the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) camera with its increased area and sensitivity over wfpc2",
    "is some ten times more effective for gc studies . here",
    "we present some of the first results on gc systems using the acs on the hubble space telescope .",
    "this is complemented with some older wfpc2 and wide - field keck telescope imaging . here",
    "we study the gc systems associated with ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 .",
    "ngc 1407 ( e0 ) is the brightest group galaxy ( bgg ) in an x - ray bright group ( osmond & ponman 2004 ; brough et al .",
    "2005 , in prep . ) , which lies within the larger eridanus cloud .",
    "ngc 1400 ( s0- ) is some 10 arcmins away from ngc 1407 in the same group .",
    "although the two galaxies have quite different heliocentric velocities ( v = 1783 km / s for ngc 1407 and v = 546 km / s for ngc 1400 ) , both are thought to lie at the same distance @xcite . based on galaxy velocities , @xcite speculated that ngc 1407 lies at the centre of a massive dark halo with m / l @xmath1 3000 .",
    "ngc 1407 has an extinction - corrected magnitude of m@xmath2 = 21.86 and effective radius of 1.2  ( 7.34 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "it lies on the fundamental plane and shows no obvious signs of morphological fine structure @xcite , but does reveal a young central stellar population of @xmath12.5 gyrs ( denicolo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "ngc 1400 has a magnitude of m@xmath2  =  20.63 and no obvious fine structure , but has a fairly large residual of + 0.3 dex with respect to the fundamental plane @xcite .",
    "motivated by the velocity differences between ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 , @xcite undertook a study of the gc systems of the two galaxies to measure the peak of the gc luminosity functions .",
    "they confirmed that ngc 1400 lies at a similar distance to ngc 1407 , despite its large peculiar velocity .",
    "they also estimated the specific frequency @xmath3 ( number of gcs per unit starlight ) of ngc 1407 to be 4.0 @xmath4 1.3 and the total gc population to be 2641 @xmath4 443 . in their observations they detected 629 @xmath4 76 gcs using the washington @xmath5-band and 556 @xmath4 61 gcs using the kron - cousins i - band .",
    "they noted that the gc system radial profile follows the galaxy halo light profile unusually closely .",
    "they did not detect bimodality in their ( @xmath6 ) colour distribution . for ngc 1400 , they derived @xmath3 = 5.2 @xmath4 2.0 based on 106 observed gcs , and again did not detect bimodality .",
    "we detect bimodality in the gc colour distribution in both galaxies and discuss the structural properties of the gc systems . in sections 2 and 3 we present imaging from the acs and wfpc2 cameras respectively . in section 4",
    "we present the wide - field keck imaging .",
    "the results for ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 are given in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "our discussion and conclusions are given in section 7 . in appendix",
    "a we give gc candidate lists which include coordinates , magnitudes and colours .",
    "coordinates are only accurate to a few arcsecs in a relative sense , less so on an absolute scale . in this paper",
    "we assume a distance to ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 of 21 mpc , where 1 arcmin corresponds to 6.12 kpc .",
    "advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images of ngc 1407 were taken in the f435w and f814w filters ( proposal i d = 9427 , pi = harris , see also harris et al .",
    "the exposure times were 1500s in f435w and 680s in f814w .",
    "the galaxy centre was offset about 1  from the centre of the acs field - of - view .",
    "the images were downloaded from the hst archive , reprocessed using the ` on - the - fly ' software and then drizzled .",
    "figure [ f : acs ] shows the f435w image .",
    "the daophotii software package @xcite was used to detect gc candidates and measure their magnitudes .",
    "objects with roundness values between 1 to 1 and sharpness from 0.5 to 1.5 were selected .",
    "we employed a detection threshold of @xmath14 , which is the product of the find - sigma parameter and the appropriate gain ratio .",
    "magnitudes were measured in a 5-pixel radius aperture .",
    "aperture corrections , from 5 to 10 pixels , were then calculated from several bright gcs in the frame .",
    "corrections from 10 pixels to the total light were taken from sirianni et al .",
    "we then used the transformation equations , with colour terms , from sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to convert our instrumental f435w and f814w magnitudes into the standard johnson b and i - band system .",
    "galactic extinction corrections of a@xmath7 = 0.282 and a@xmath8 = 0.13 were then applied . after applying a color selection of 1.2 @xmath9 2.5 ( which corresponds to 2.5 @xmath10 [ fe / h ] @xmath10 1.0 using the relation of @xcite ) , we inspected the images and visually removed obvious contaminants ( such as background galaxies ) . this reduced the data set to 952 potential globular clusters .",
    "a colour error cut of @xmath40.25 mag .",
    "was then applied , leaving 903 objects .",
    "the behaviour of the colour error for candidate gcs is shown in figure [ f : hcolourerror ] .",
    "the remaining contamination rate of foreground stars or background galaxies is statistically insignificant given the high spatial resolution of the acs .",
    "we did not detect any gcs interior to a galactocentric radius of 1 .",
    "we have performed completeness tests by generating a large number of artifical objects with sizes and colours that resemble gcs .",
    "these are then randomly inserted into the f435w and f814w acs images using the addstar task .",
    "we maintained a density of objects similar to that of the original data so that additional crowding did not affect our results .",
    "these were then recovered using the same object detection process as described above .",
    "finally , the test was run three times to improve the statistical significance . in figure",
    "[ f : complete ] we show the recovered completeness fraction of artifical objects as a function of b and i magnitude .",
    "the plot shows that our 50% completeness limits are b @xmath1 26.0 and i @xmath1 24.2 .    a colour - magnitude diagram of the acs gcs is shown in figure [ f : hcolour ] .",
    "it shows evidence for bimodal colours , with the brightest gcs having @xmath11 22 . as can be seen in the figure ,",
    "there is one object which is significantly brighter than all the others , with @xmath12 = 20.98 . although @xmath1 1 mag .",
    "brighter than the other selected objects , a spectrum from the keck telescope indicates that it has a velocity consistent with that of ngc 1407 ( cenarro et al .",
    "its magnitude ( m@xmath7 = 10.62 ) is similar to that of omega cen in our galaxy . visually it appears similar to other gcs in the acs image , it is not obviously a dwarf galaxy .",
    "its effective radius ( of @xmath1 4 pc ) is consistent with a gc at the distance of ngc 1407 and not an ultra compact dwarf @xcite .",
    "thus except for this interesting object , our data set has an effective bright magnitude limit of @xmath11 21.5 .",
    "the faint limit is @xmath11 26",
    ".    objects with colours @xmath0 @xmath10 1.2 and @xmath0 @xmath13 2.5 are likely to be faint stars or compact galaxies .",
    "the small number of such objects indicates that the contamination level in our selected colour range ( 1.2 @xmath10 @xmath0 @xmath10 2.5 ) is likely to be quite small .",
    "wide field and planetary camera 2 images of ngc 1400 were taken in the f555w and f814w filters ( proposal i d = 5999 , pi = phillips ) .",
    "the data consisted of three 160s f814w images and one 160s f555w image .",
    "the pipeline - reduced images were downloaded from the hst archive and the multiple f814w images were average - combined .",
    "the four wfpc2 ccds were mosaiced together using the mosaic task in stsdas .",
    "figure [ f : wfpc2 ] shows the combined f814w image . to aid in the detection of globular cluster candidates on the pc image , we fitted and subtracted the galaxy isophotes using the ellipse task in iraf allowing the centre , ellipticity and position angle to vary .",
    "no objects were detected within 5  of the galaxy centre .",
    "the detection of globular clusters was carried out using the daophotii package .",
    "detection was based solely on the f814w image , which had a higher signal - to - noise ratio than the f555w image but also , more importantly , was largely devoid of cosmic rays .",
    "detection criteria consisted of a roundness range of 1 to 1 , a sharpness range of 0.2 to 1 and a threshold of 4 times the background .",
    "objects in the pc image were detected separately from the wfc images due to the different pixel scales and background levels .",
    "this gave over 1,000 potential gcs .",
    "photometry of the detected objects was carried out for both the f555w and f814w images using the coordinates of the objects detected in the f814w image via the qphot task in the apphot package .",
    "zeropoints and the conversion to johnson @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands were taken following the method described in @xcite with galactic extinction corrections of a@xmath2 = 0.21 and a@xmath8 = 0.13 .",
    "various selection criteria were applied to the data , i.e. a colour error cut of @xmath4 0.5 mag .",
    ", a colour selection of @xmath16 , and a magnitude selection of @xmath17 .",
    "the colour error is dominated by the uncertainty in the @xmath14-band magnitudes which come from a single short f555w image .",
    "the colour selection can be seen in figure [ f : wcolourerror ] , and the colour - magnitude selection in figure [ f : wcolourselect ] .",
    "these cuts , as well as a visual inspection to remove duplicate matches , obvious galaxies and edge effects resulted in a data set of 204 objects .",
    "a mosaic of eight @xmath12 and @xmath15-band images of ngc 1407 and the surrounding area ( including ngc 1400 ) were acquired using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ) on the 10 m keck i telescope on 2004 october 12 and 13 .",
    "lris is equipped with a tek 2048x2048 detector which is mounted on the cassegrain focus with a dual - beam imager so @xmath12 and @xmath15 images can be obtained simultaneously .",
    "eight pointings were obtained as shown on figure [ f : fields ] .",
    "each field had an area of @xmath1 6 @xmath18 7.8 arcmin@xmath19 , but since the two ccds have slightly different scales ( 0.138pixel@xmath20 in @xmath12 and the 0.215pixel@xmath20 in @xmath15 ) , the actual field - of - view differed slightly between bands .",
    "all pointings had an exposure time of 600s .",
    "the seeing conditions were not very good and varied between pointings with a median of @xmath1 1.3 .",
    "time did not allow for a background field to be observed .",
    "bias subtraction was performed using the wmkolris package provided by the observatory and flat - fielding was performed using standard iraf procedures .    to aid in the detection of inner globular cluster candidates , a model of ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 in the @xmath12-band",
    "was subtracted before running our object detection algorithm ( the @xmath15-band image was saturated ) .",
    "a smooth galaxy model was created using the ellipse task in iraf / stsdas allowing the centre , ellipticity and position angle to vary .",
    "the daophot package was used to select potential globular clusters in each of the eight @xmath12 and @xmath15 images .",
    "selection criteria consisted of a roundness range of 1 to 1 and a sharpness range of 0 to 1 with the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio threshold , full width half maximum ( fwhm ) and minimum and maximum good data values adjusted to the seeing conditions of each image .",
    "this resulted in over 10,000 potential globular clusters for each filter .",
    "the pointing containing the galaxy centre was adopted as the reference field to derive photometric zeropoints because a portion of the field overlapped with a significant portion of the acs field .",
    "a small number of objects in common with both the acs and central keck images were identified .",
    "the keck magnitudes were then adjusted to match the photometrically - calibrated acs magnitudes , thus giving zeropoints for the keck images .",
    "the qphot task in the apphot package was used to measure the magnitude and error of each object found by daofind , using an inner sky annulus radius of the fwhm and a sky annulus width of half the fwhm and the previously calculated photometric zeropoints .",
    "spatial matching of the @xmath12 and @xmath15 object lists reduced the data set to under 5,000 potential gcs .",
    "various other selection criteria were then applied to the data , i.e. retaining only objects with roundness between 0.5 and 0.5 , colour error less than @xmath40.25 mag . ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the colour error selection can be seen in figure [ f : kcolourerror ] and the colour and magnitude selection can be seen in the colour magnitude diagram in figure [ f : kcolourselect ] .",
    "these cuts , as well as a visual inspection to remove duplicate matches and extended objects resulted in a more manageable and realistic data set of 474 candidate gcs .",
    "the bright magnitude cut corresponds to that of the acs data , while the colour limits are broader to take into account the increased photometric error of the keck data .",
    "the celestial coordinates of each object were calculated using the aladin sky atlas and vizier catalogue service with the usno - b1.0 catalogue to identify four stars in each field .",
    "the starlink astrom program was used to perform the coordinate transformation and fitting , using the transformation of the central image with the best fit for each field .",
    "we determined galactocentric coordinates for each object based on their celestial coordinates and the ngc 1407 galaxy centre .",
    "we did not detect any gcs within a galactocentric radius of 20 .",
    "visual inspection of the keck images suggests a population of gcs associated with ngc 1400 . from an analysis of the gc surface density distribution",
    "centred on ngc 1400 ( see section 6.2 ) , we associate 74 of the 474 candidate gcs described earlier with ngc 1400 .",
    "we have removed these from the ngc 1407 object list , leaving 400 candidate gcs associated with ngc 1407 .",
    "we note that an extrapolation of the ngc 1407 gc surface density profile ( see section 5.2 below ) would suggest less than 10 gcs associated with ngc 1407 lie at the projected radius of ngc 1400 .",
    "figure [ f : n1400cmd ] shows a colour magnitude diagram for the 74 gc candidates thought to be associated with ngc 1400 .",
    "in figure [ f : hgaussfit ] , the colour histogram for the acs data is shown , with two gaussians fitted to the distribution .",
    "this fit was done using the ngaussfit task in iraf and allowing the amplitudes and central position and fhwm to vary .",
    "the system is well fit by two gaussians with 36% in the blue subpopulation and 64% in the red one .",
    "the blue subpopulation has a peak colour of @xmath0 = 1.61 and the red subpopulation peak is at @xmath0 = 2.06 ; both with an uncertainty of @xmath40.02 .",
    "this is confirmed by a kmm ( @xcite ) statistical analysis on the unbinned colour data which gives peaks of @xmath0 = 1.61 and 2.06 , with 38% in the blue subpopulation and 62% in the red one .",
    "the blue subpopulation , with a gaussian width @xmath23 = 0.14 @xmath4 0.03 has a narrower distribution than the red subpopulation , with a @xmath23 = 0.17 @xmath4 0.03 .",
    "the rms colour error for our sample is @xmath10.06 which indicates an intrinsic widths of @xmath23 = 0.13 and 0.16 mag . for the blue and red subpopulations respectively .",
    "thus both subpopulations contain a range of ages and/or metallicities .",
    "if we assume that the gcs are all very old ( see cenarro et al .",
    "2005 , in prep . ) , and that the intrinsic colour widths are entirely due to metallicity , we can derive the metallicity spread . using the relation of barmby et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we derive widths of @xmath23[fe / h ] = 0.72 and 0.89 dex for the blue and red subpopulations respectively .",
    "any age differences will make these metallicity ranges upper limits . acs imaging of gc systems in other galaxies also indicates red subpopulations that are broader in colour than the blue subpopulation ( strader et al .",
    "2005 ; harris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we note that equally good fits to the data can be found with widths that are the same for both subpopulations . in the case of equal width",
    "colour distributions , the relative proportions are essentially unchanged .",
    "the keck colour distribution is slightly less well - defined than the acs one ( see fig .",
    "[ f : kgaussfit ] ) , however we were still able to fit two gaussians using the same method .",
    "best - fit gaussians were found with peaks at @xmath0 = 1.65 and @xmath0 = 2.04 @xmath4 0.05 .",
    "the blue subpopulation was 41% and the red one 59% of the total , with an uncertainty of about 10% .",
    "these peaks and relative proportions are statistically the same as those found in the acs data ( we might expect to find relatively more blue gcs in the keck data as it probes to larger galactocentric radii ) .",
    "again , we see that the blue subpopulation , with @xmath23 = 0.14 is narrower then the red subpopulation , with @xmath23 = 0.19 , and that both values are very similar to those in the acs data .",
    "we note that the mean colour for the keck data ( @xmath0 = 1.92 @xmath4 0.02 ) is consistent with that from the acs data ( @xmath0 = 1.89 @xmath4 0.01 ) .    finally , we note that the bright ( b @xmath24 24 ) blue gcs are on average slightly redder ( by @xmath1 0.1 mag . ) than the faint blue gcs in the acs data .",
    "( the red gcs do not appear to show a similar colour - magnitude trend . )",
    "although this trend is not particularly noticable in our ngc 1407 acs data , it has been seen recently for the gc systems of other galaxies studied with the acs ( strader et al .",
    "2005 ; harris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the trend is unlikely to be an artifact of photometric errors ( see also harris et al .",
    "2005 ) nor is it due to size variations ( we find no strong size - luminosity trend within a gc subpopulation ) .",
    "such trends have not been reported in ground - based or even hst wfpc2 studies of gc systems , and we find no obvious trend in our keck data .      the surface density versus galactocentric radius of both the acs and keck data sets ( total @xmath1 1300 objects ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : msdensity ] .",
    "a correction was made for the missing area in each radial annulus and errors were calculated assuming poisson statistics .",
    "the outermost acs annulus was chosen to match the innermost keck annulus so that the acs data could be normalised to match the keck data .",
    "the subpopulations have been defined where the two gaussian fits to their colour distributions contribute the same amount to the combined fit , i.e. @xmath25 1.8 for both the acs and keck data .",
    "the outermost keck annulus , at a mean radius of 70 kpc is consistent with a constant surface density of objects .",
    "this suggests that we have reached the background and so these values have been subtracted from all the other keck annuli .",
    "the acs data are assumed to be free from background contamination .",
    "each of the data sets ( total , blue and red globular cluster populations ) show a centrally concentrated globular cluster system with a ` core ' region of near constant surface density and a power - law like fall - off in the outer regions . comparing the blue and the red subpopulations , it is noted that the blue subpopulation has a much larger core radius than the red subpopulation . following",
    "@xcite we fit the core region with an isothermal - like profile of the form : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the core radius . fitting only the acs data points , we derive @xmath27 for the total population to be @xmath28 , @xmath29 for the red subpopulation and @xmath30 arcmin for the blue subpopulation ( where 1 arcmin is 6.12 kpc ) .",
    "a simple power - law ( @xmath31 ) fit to the outer most four data points , from a radius of 1.95  to 7.2 , gives a slope of 1.57 @xmath4 0.08 for the total gc system .",
    "this can be compared to the steeper values found by @xcite of @xmath32 in the @xmath33-band and @xmath34 in the @xmath15-band .",
    "the slopes for the blue and red subpopulations are 1.65 @xmath4 0.29 and 1.50 @xmath4 0.06 respectively , which are statistically the same as each other and the total gc system .",
    "figure [ f : msdensity ] also shows the galaxy @xmath12-band surface brightness profile from the keck data as a solid line , after converting to log units and applying an arbitrary vertical normalisation .",
    "as can be seen , for the region of overlap with the outer gc system , the galaxy starlight has a similar slope of 1.42 to that of the gc system with slope of 1.57 @xmath4 0.08 .",
    "the plot also shows that there are more red globular clusters in the inner parts of the galaxy than blue . at larger radii",
    ", there appears to be slightly more red gcs than blue ones , which is an unexpected result as studies of other galaxies have generally found the blue subpopulation dominating the red at large radii .",
    "this could be due to increased contamination rates in the red subpopulation at large radii .",
    "figure [ f : mangle ] shows the position angle dependence of gcs in ngc 1407 .",
    "this figure was constructed from the annuli in which we had complete coverage ; for the keck data this was a single thin annulus between 2.7and 4.2  and for the acs data , it was all gcs within a 0.9  radius of the centre of the galaxy . within the poisson error bars a flat distribution ( i.e. no dependence on position angle )",
    "is consistent with the data .",
    "since ngc 1407 is an e0 galaxy , it might be expected that the globular cluster distribution should not depend on position angle .",
    "this is indeed what has been found .",
    "using the position angle of each globular cluster in the complete coverage area , we also computed the ellipticity of the gc system using @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the position angle .",
    "we obtained an ellipticity measure of 0.13 @xmath4 0.08 from the keck data and 0.06 @xmath4 0.04 from the acs data , both corresponding to an e0e1 distribution .",
    "with the superior spatial resolution of the acs , the gcs in ngc 1407 are marginally resolved .",
    "we have convolved a moffat profile with a psf taken from a star in the i - band acs image . using this psf with the ishape routine ( larsen 1999 ) ,",
    "we have determined the size of each gc candidate .",
    "we find a large range in the effective radii of individual gcs but the mean value is r@xmath37 = 2.9 @xmath4 0.1 pc .",
    "this is consistent with the mean value for the milky way gc system of 3.5 @xmath4 0.4 pc ( harris 1996 ) . dividing the sample into blue and red subpopulations ( at b  i = 1.8 )",
    "we find a statistically significant difference in their sizes , i.e. for the blue gcs the mean r@xmath37 = 3.24 @xmath4 0.19 pc vs r@xmath37 = 2.68 @xmath4 0.12 pc for the red ones .",
    "thus the red gcs appear to be @xmath120% smaller than the blue gcs .",
    "a histogram of the blue and red gc distributions is shown in figure [ f : size ] .",
    "the distributions are similar but the red gc distribution is peaked at a smaller effective radius .",
    "we also find a half dozen objects with sizes @xmath1 2040 pc ( not shown in figure [ f : size ] ) .",
    "visual inspection shows these large objects to be well - detected and similar in appearance to other gcs .",
    "they cover the full range of magnitudes from b = 22.8 to the magnitude limit .",
    "they have a mean colour of b ",
    "i = 1.78 @xmath4 0.11 , i.e. statistically the same as the general gc population . however , as well as larger sizes they are more elliptical ( less round ) than the general gc population .",
    "the luminosity function of gc systems ( number of gcs per unit magnitude ) has been shown to be remarkably similar , or ` universal ' , across a wide range of galaxies .",
    "for example , in a recent review of gc luminosity functions , richtler ( 2003 ) derived a a mean peak , or turnover magnitude in the v - band ( which is the most commonly studied ) of m@xmath2 = 7.51 @xmath4 0.24 and @xmath23 @xmath1 1.2 for a sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "the ngc 1407 gc system has peaks ( v ",
    "i)@xmath38 @xmath1 0.95 and 1.15 , which implies an i - band turnover magnitude of m@xmath8 = 8.46 and 8.66 for the metal - poor and metal - rich subpopulations respectively . for the total gc system ,",
    "we assume ( v  i)@xmath38 = 1.05 and hence m@xmath8 = 8.56 . for the b - band ,",
    "we use ( b ",
    "v)@xmath38 = 0.7 and 0.9 which corresponds to the expected colours for [ fe / h ] = 1.5 and 0.5 of a 15 gyr old stellar population .",
    "this gives m@xmath7 = 6.81 and 6.61 for the two subpopulations .",

    "however , the red peak at around @xmath0 = 2.29 or @xmath46 = 1.28 is much redder than the @xcite relation .",
    "this suggests that the red subpopulation in ngc 1400 is poorly defined in terms of its peak colour .",

    "we find that both subpopulations are intrinsically broad ( indicating a range of ages and/or metallicities ) , with the red subpopulation being broader than the blue .",
    "we find the half ",
    "light radius of red gcs to be on average 20% smaller than those of blue gcs .",
    "smaller relative sizes for the red gcs has been reported for several galaxies ( kundu & whitmore 1998 ; larsen et al .",
    "larsen & brodie ( 2003 ) have speculated that the sizes differences may not be real but due to projection effects .",

    "galactocentric radius relation .",
    "we find no evidence for such a trend in our data , in either the combined or blue and red gc subpopulations separately .",
    "although we note that a careful modeling of the projected and 3d relations is needed to conclusively rule out this possibility . an alternative explanation , that predicts no size ",
    "galactocentric radius trend is that proposed by jordan ( 2004 ) .",
    "he suggests that the process of mass segregation and stellar evolution effects will result in a smaller measured half  light radius for the metal - rich gcs .",
    "assuming coeval populations , an initial mass function , michie - king isotropic models and constant _ half  mass _ radii , his favoured model predicts that the red subpopulation of ngc 1407 ( [ fe / h ] = 0.19 ) will have half  light radii that are 20% smaller than the blue subpopulation ( [ fe / h ] = 1.45 ) .",
    "this is entirely consistent with our measurements .",
    "jordan notes that if the metal - rich gcs were younger by 3 gyrs , then the predicted size difference would increase to 30% .",
    "thus within the assumptions of the model , our size measurements suggest that the gc system of ngc 1407 is old and coeval .",
    "we also find half a dozen objects with effective radii of 2040 pc .",
    "they may be related to the ` faint fuzzies ' seen in some s0 galaxies ( larsen & brodie 2000 ) .",
    "however the faint fuzzies tend to be quite red , whereas these large objects in ngc 1407 are not particularly red .",
    "alternatively , they could be related to ultra compact dwarfs ( ucds ) which have been observed around some elliptical galaxies ( e.g. drinkwater et al .",
    "2004 ; richtler 2005 ) .",
    "although our large objects do not have the bright magnitudes expected of ucds associated with ngc 1407 .",
    "given their large sizes and elongations , we suspect they are background galaxies .    the gc surface density profiles of both galaxies reveal a near constant density central region with a power - law like fall off in the outer parts , similar to those seen in other gc systems .",
    "we have fit the central region with an isothermal ` core ' profile deriving a gc core radius of 7.5 @xmath4 0.7 kpc for ngc 1407 and 4.6 @xmath4 0.8 kpc for ngc 1400 .",
    "these values can be compared to the gc core radius - galaxy luminosity scaling relation found by @xcite .",
    "both ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 would appear to have larger core radii than galaxies of similar luminosity .",
    "such core radii in gc systems may be due to destruction via tidal shocks @xcite .",
    "however , we find no evidence for a mean gc magnitude that varies with galactocentric radius as might be expected .",
    "an alternative explanation for the gc system core region is that of dissipationless merger events or accretions @xcite .    for ngc 1407 , we had sufficient gc numbers to separate the blue and red subpopulations .",
    "we found the red subpopulation to have a core radius of 6.1 @xmath4 0.8 kpc and outer slope of 1.50 @xmath4 0.06 , while the blue one was somewhat larger with 14.2 @xmath4 1.0 kpc and slope of 1.65 @xmath4 0.29 .",
    "this difference in subpopulation core size , if found in a number of galaxies , needs to be understood .    beyond the central core region the gc surface density slopes",
    "were compared to the galaxy starlight . for ngc 1407",
    "the gc and galaxy starlight slopes were very similar , around 1.5 .",
    "however , the gc profile for ngc 1400 ( from the limited keck data ) appears to be significantly flatter than the galaxy slope .",
    "both galaxies reveal gc slopes that lie within the cosmic scatter of the gc slope - galaxy luminosity scaling relation @xcite .    for both ngc 1407 and ngc 1400",
    "we find that their gc systems have a similar ellipticity ( i.e. near zero ) and azimuthal distribution ( i.e. no strong position angle dependence ) as the underlying galaxy starlight .",
    "similar trends have been seen in other galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .    using the acs data for ngc 1407",
    ", we have fit the gc luminosity function taking into account photometric errors and incompleteness .",
    "our i - band fits agree very well with those of @xcite . as well as fitting the total gc system",

    "<S> we present wide - field keck telescope imaging of the globular cluster ( gc ) systems around ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 in the eridanus galaxy cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this is complemented by hubble space telescope images from the advanced camera for surveys of ngc 1407 and wide field and planetary camera 2 images of ngc 1400 . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly detect bimodality in the gc colour distribution of ngc 1407 . </S>",
    "<S> the blue gc subpopulation has a mean colour of @xmath0 = 1.61 and a relative contribution of around 40% , whereas the red subpopulation with @xmath0 = 2.06 contributes 60% to the overall gc system . </S>",
    "<S> assuming old ages , this corresponds to [ fe / h ] = 1.45 and 0.19 . </S>",
    "<S> both subpopulations are intrinsically broad in colour ( indicating a range in ages and/or metallicities ) , with the red subpopulation being broader than the blue . </S>",
    "<S> the gc colour distribution for ngc 1400 is less clear cut than for ngc 1407 , however , we also find evidence for a bimodal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find the ngc 1407 red gcs to be 20% smaller in size than the blue ones . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the expectations of mass segregation in an old coeval gc system . </S>",
    "<S> half a dozen large objects ( 2040 pc ) , with gc - like colours are identified , which are probably background galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> the hst data sets allow us to probe to small galactocentric radii . here </S>",
    "<S> we find both gc systems to possess a gc surface density distribution which is largely constant in these inner galaxy regions . </S>",
    "<S> we fit isothermal - like profiles and derive gc system core radii of 9.4 kpc for ngc 1407 and 5.8 kpc for ngc 1400 . for ngc 1407 </S>",
    "<S> we are able to separate the surface density distribution into blue and red subpopulations , giving 17.8 and 7.6 kpc respectively . outside this central region , </S>",
    "<S> the radial profile of the gc surface density is similar to that of the galaxy light for ngc 1407 but it is flatter for ngc 1400 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean gc magnitude appears to be constant with galactocentric radius . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for both galaxies , the gc systems have a similar ellipticity and azimuthal distribution as the underlying galaxy starlight . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to the gc luminosity function gives a distance modulus of 31.6 , which is in good agreement with distances based on the faber - jackson relation and the virgo infall corrected velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this distance lies at the midpoint of recent surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements . </S>"
