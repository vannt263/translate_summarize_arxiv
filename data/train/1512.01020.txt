    "the goal of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is to allow two distant parties , alice and bob , to share a secret key even in the presence of an eavesdropper , eve . since in quantum mechanics measurements",
    "irremediably perturb the systems , it is impossible for an eavesdropper to extract useful information without being noticed . quantum key distribution protocols , like the bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) protocol @xcite ,",
    "are proven to be unconditionally secure , when using single photons . however , due to the spread of laser systems and the difficulty of realizing true single photon sources , most qkd implementations use attenuated pulsed lasers as sources .",
    "the need to avoid multi - photon pulses , that can leak information through the photon number splitting ( pns ) attack @xcite , requires a low mean photon number per pulse .",
    "this , however , increments the incidence of pulses containing no photons , thus limiting the key generation rate . the incidence of the pns attack can be limited using the decoy state technique @xcite , at the expenses of the necessity to modulate the laser intensity .",
    "these limitations have encouraged the research of sources emitting a single photon for each pulse .",
    "one possible implementation of these sources is based on localized quantum structures , such as color centres @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , atoms @xcite or ions @xcite in a cavity .",
    "these schemes , however , show some major drawbacks : the need of expensive equipment for their operation and limitations in wavelength and bandwidth selection @xcite .",
    "an alternative scheme for single photon sources exploits the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in a non - linear crystal .",
    "an intense laser pump on a non - linear crystal leads to the probabilistic emission of pairs of photons , called signal and idler .",
    "the idler photon can be used to `` herald '' the presence of the signal photon , giving the so called heralded source ( hs ) . if the duration of the pulse is much greater than the reciprocal of the phase - matching bandwidth the statistics of the pairs is still poissonian @xcite .",
    "there are some strategies for improving the single - photon character of the heralded source .",
    "one strategy consists in using a single hs with photon number resolving detector on the idler channel and selecting the pulses where only one photon has been detected @xcite .",
    "an alternative strategy uses parallel hs units and post - selection : each unit is pumped with low intensity to suppress multi - photon events , while keeping the overall rate at an acceptable level .",
    "the scheme of multiple hs with post - selection ( mhps ) has been originally proposed by migdall _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite : it used an @xmath0-to-1 optical switch triggered by a detector on the idler photon of each hs .",
    "_  took into account also the finite efficiency of single photon detectors but , as pointed out by shapiro and wong @xcite , the current low efficiency of @xmath0-to-1 optical switches strongly limits the performance of this architecture . to overcome this limitation , they proposed a symmetric scheme ( smhps ) using @xmath0 hs units linked by @xmath1 binary polarization - based photon switches in a tree structure @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : smhps ] .",
    "they studied the probability of single - photon and multi - photon pulses , with real detectors and optical switches .",
    "their scheme has been subsequently implemented using 4 crystals , both with bulk optics @xcite and using hybrid photonic circuits @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis of multiple heralded sources with post - selection has been performed in @xcite . from their work",
    ", it emerges that , in the case of imperfect devices , the symmetric scheme suffers from a scalability issue , with a decrease in one photon probability when increasing the number of crystals . in @xcite , a new asymmetric scheme ( amhps ) that does not present this problem",
    "was also proposed .",
    "the scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amhps ] for completeness .",
    "the smhps and amhps schemes were also referred respectively as _ log - tree _ and _ chained scheme _ in @xcite .",
    "sub - poissonian sources have already been demonstrated to give an improvement over poissonian ones in the key rate of a qkd system @xcite .",
    "this article specializes the analysis to the case of the multiple - crystal heralded photon sources studied in @xcite , parametrizing them using their design parameters instead of the more experimentally relevant efficiency and second - order correlation .",
    "moreover , the security analysis is extended to the case of general attacks by eve @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we follow @xcite , and compare the performances of the different architectures and their efficacy in a practical qkd implementation .",
    "an ideal mhps in the configuration proposed by migdall _",
    "et al . _ , with perfect heralding efficiency and an @xmath0-to-1 optical switch with no losses , is studied first , in order to give an account of the maximum performance that can be obtained with this kind of sources .",
    "next , two architectures for implementing a multiplexed source in a realistic scenario are analyzed , based on _ symmetric _ and _ asymmetric _ networks of 2-to-1 switches .",
    "finite heralding efficiency and optical switch transmittance are considered in order to illustrate the potential of these source with state - of - the - art technology .",
    "the different types of sources are inserted in a common model of qkd , based on the bb84 protocol and taking into account channel and detector inefficiencies @xcite .",
    "the optimization maximizes the key generation rate for the different architectures , with different numbers of hs units , for a wide range of channel losses .",
    "the obtained values are then compared with the key generation rate of both an ideal single photon source and an attenuated laser .",
    "the symmetric and asymmetric schemes are also optimized when used with decoy states @xcite , both in an active @xcite and in a passive scheme @xcite .",
    "the active scheme , where alice actively changes the output statistics of its apparatus , allows her to choose an arbitrary number of decoy states , giving her the ability to estimate channel parameters with arbitrary precision .",
    "passive decoy , on the other hand , is implemented by exploiting photon number correlations of the two outputs of non - linear crystals @xcite .",
    "this gives less flexibility in the choice of the decoy states , thus limiting the precision of parameter estimation , but allows to reach a key generation rate comparable with active decoy without introducing further complexity in alice s apparatus .",
    "to evaluate the performances of the heralded single photon sources , we consider the bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) qkd protocol @xcite with polarization encoding .",
    "alice , the transmitter , encodes the random bits into the @xmath2 or the @xmath3 basis , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 refer to the horizontal , vertical , diagonal and anti - diagonal polarization respectively .",
    "bob randomly measures the incoming photon into the @xmath8 or @xmath9 basis .",
    "after the transmission , alice and bob discard the events in which the sent and measured basis are different . on the remaining events , they evaluate the secret key rate , namely the amount of unconditional secret bits that they have produced .    , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the transmittance of 2-to-1 optical switches .",

    "the source is pumped by a pulsed laser , with phase randomization between each pulse @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath20 is proportional to the intensity of the pump laser , which is related to the mean number of pairs generated by each hs per pulse .",
    "the sources are parametrized by the number of non - linear crystals ( i.e. of hs units ) @xmath0 and , for the smhps and the amhps , by the efficiency of the heralding detectors @xmath12 and the transmittance of the optical switches @xmath11 . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the scheme used in the switching network is no longer significant , therefore the output statistics of the two architectures coincide .",

    "assuming independence between signal and background , the yield of an @xmath13-photon pulse for a dlc can be predicted to be @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the probability of a dark count event , which is @xmath36 in the case of two independent detectors and small dark count probability . from now on we use the convention of indicating with tilde the predicted parameters for a dlc . the negative term , coming from the fact that real detection events and dark counts are not mutually exclusive , can be neglected , since @xmath37 .",

    "after the transmission , alice and bob use post - processing to extract a shared , secret key from the exchanged symbols . the secret key rate @xmath43 is defined as the fraction of pulses that produce a secret bit ( without counting those discarded in the sifting phase ) @xcite .",
    "its high dependence on source statistics makes it the most suitable parameter for the comparison of the different configurations .",

    "the decoy state technique has been introduced to counteract the pns attack @xcite .",
    "it consists on randomly varying the source statistic , so that eve can no longer adapt her attack to alice s state .",
    "after the transmission , alice communicates bob the state she used for every pulse , allowing them to estimate channel parameters conditioned to that knowledge .",
    "the decoy state technique is active in the sense that alice chooses the output statistics using a random number generator and ( typically ) a variable attenuator after the source . in principle",
    ", she can choose an arbitrary number of decoy states : however it has been shown that just using the vacuum and a weak decoy state gives tight bounds on the relevant parameters @xcite .",

    "following @xcite , we make the simplifying assumption that the parameters have been determined exactly .      in passive decoy state qkd ,",
    "the source statistics is not under alice s direct control , but is conditioned on some random event at alice s side .",
    "a typical example consists in an attenuate coherent state passing through a 50/50 beam splitter ( bs ) with a single photon detector at the reflected output : the photon statistic at the transmitting output of the bs changes when alice detects or not a photon . in the case of heralded sources ,",

    "bob s apparatus is characterized by optical transmittance @xmath75 and detectors with quantum efficiency @xmath76 and dark count probability @xmath77 , corresponding to the state - of - the - art of infrared semiconductor single photon detectors @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the error correction code is @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "all the simulated key rates are compared with the one obtained with an attenuated laser source ( wcs ) of poissonian output statistics @xmath79 , where @xmath20 is the mean number of photons per pulse , both without and with decoy state . in the passive scheme ,",
    "the comparison is extended to the one decoy state with attenuated laser described in @xcite , where also the inefficiencies in parameter estimation are taken into account .",
    "furthermore , all schemes are compared with the single photon case , representing an upper bound of the rate attainable in a given configuration .    in the following subsections the performances of the heralded single photon source are compared in different cases .",
    "the ideal mhps gives the maximum key rate attainable with this kind of sources @xcite .",
    "this value is shown in figure [ fig : single ] .        the key rate increases with the number of hs units and approaches the single photon case for @xmath80 , in the low loss regime . indeed , for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , approximating the single photon case for @xmath84 .",
    "at increasing losses , however , the contribution of multi - photon pulses increases and the source shows the same behaviour as the attenuated laser .",
    "this had already been observed in @xcite , with the difference that , for low @xmath0 , not only the fraction of multi - photon pulses is higher , determining the lower maximum tolerable loss level , but also the incidence of pulses with zero photons is stronger , determining the lower key rate at @xmath85{db}$ ] .",
    "while these limitations are proper of the multiple - crystal architecture itself , the implementation using finite efficiency devices further reduces the key generation rate . using @xmath86 and @xmath87 as , respectively , heralding efficiency and switch transmittance @xcite , the key generation rate of the smhps and the amhps has the values shown in figure [ fig : symm_asymm ] .        both the key rate and the maximum tolerable losses are lower than for the ideal mhps , since the low switch transmittance requires a higher mean number of generated pairs per pulse in order to avoid zero - photon pulses , thus increasing also the incidence of multi - photon pulses .",
    "this effect is particularly evident in the case of the smhps , where , independently from the hs unit triggered to output , the number of switches crossed scales as @xmath10 . for few hs units , where the number of crossed switches is low ,",
    "the predominant effect is the suppression of multi - photon events , therefore the key rate increases with @xmath0 . for a higher number of hs units ( such as @xmath88 or @xmath80 )",
    ", the source shows a low key rate for low losses ( not much higher than the attenuated laser one ) and a high maximum tolerable loss level . in the limit @xmath81 , any advantage over the attenuated laser is lost .    on the other hand",
    ", the amhps has a more stable behaviour , since its key rate never decreases by increasing @xmath0 , but reaches an optimal value and then remains unchanged ( the key rates for @xmath89 and @xmath80 are almost equal ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , when a certain number of hs units has been reached , the addition of further hs units does not yield significant improvement , since the probability that the rightmost hs units are triggered to the output is negligible and the output is given only by the leftmost hs units , whose configuration does not change ( see figure [ fig : amhps ] ) .",
    "the different behaviour of the two architectures is even more evident when studying their key rate at the variation of the two relevant source parameters , the detection efficiency @xmath12 and the switch transmittance @xmath11 .",
    "the key rate of the smhps and the amhps is shown , respectively , in figures [ fig : symm_hg ] and [ fig : asymm_hg ] , when fixing @xmath86 and changing @xmath11 on the left and with fixed @xmath87 and changing @xmath12 on the right .",
    "the behaviour of the smhps is highly dependent on the switch transmittance . for low @xmath11",
    ", the benefits deriving from multiple hs units do not compensate the higher absorption rate . as evident from figure [ fig : symm_hg ] , for @xmath90 the smhps does not perform much better than the attenuated laser .",
    "this is consistent with the results from @xcite , where it has been shown that , in the asymptotic limit @xmath81 , the smhps performs better than the attenuated laser for @xmath91 .",
    "the curve @xmath87 corresponds to the transition between the laser - like regime and the mhps - like one .",
    "the effect of the detector efficiency @xmath12 is evident in the high loss regime , where the influence of the lower number of multi - photon pulses is more important .",
    "this can be evinced from the right plot of figure [ fig : symm_hg ] , where the detection efficiency @xmath12 is varied for the case @xmath87 . in the low loss regime ,",
    "the key rate is the same for all values of @xmath12 , showing that in this region the dominating effect is photon absorption in the optical routing . on the other hand",
    ", the high loss regime shows an improvement in the maximum tolerable loss level from @xmath92{db}$ ] for @xmath93 to @xmath94{db}$ ] for @xmath95 .",
    "the increased detection efficiency allows a better choice of the hs unit to route to output , thus allowing the hs units to be pumped with less intensity and decreasing the incidence of multi - photon pulses .",
    "the key rate curves of the amhps , on the contrary , show the same trend for all tested combinations @xmath96 . in the asymmetric scheme , indeed , photons emitted by the leftmost hs units pass a low number of optical switches before being routed to output , therefore the effect of photon absorption never dominates over multi - photon pulses .",
    "the key rate for active decoy is obtained by using equation ( [ eq : active_rate ] ) , with @xmath55 , @xmath35 and @xmath56 calculated by using the channel parameters given in ( [ eq : e_n ] ) and ( [ eq : y_n ] ) . the results of simulations are shown in figure [ fig : active ] .",
    "the normalized mean number of generated pairs that maximizes the key rate is almost constant for both sources in the range @xmath97 , with a steep fall in the regime where dark counts become important .",
    "the rate of the smhps decreases as the number of crystals increases , thus further underlining the detrimental effect of the increased absorption in optical switches .",
    "the amhps , on the other hand , does not show any improvement for more than 4 hs units , because the probability of triggering the rightmost hs units is negligible ( see appendix [ sec : source ] ) .    since in the proposed implementation of passive decoy the bound on channel parameters is no longer optimal , simulations have to take into account also this effect on the key rate .",
    "therefore , the key rate is calculated by inserting the bounds for @xmath55 , @xmath35 and @xmath56 into ( [ eq : passive_partial_rate ] ) and taking into account the fraction of pulses using each statistics with equation ( [ eq : passive_rate ] ) .",
    "simulation results are shown in figure [ fig : passive ] .",
    "the use of just two different statistics gives a non - optimal parameter estimation , so a lower key rate than the schemes using active decoy . to account for this ,",
    "the rates in figure [ fig : passive ] are compared also with a similar , one decoy scheme implemented with attenuated laser pulses @xcite .",
    "the worse bound on the parameters gives a worse estimation of the information leaked to eve , thus requiring the sources to be pumped with lower intensity than in the case of active decoy ( the normalized mean number of generated pairs oscillates , in this case , between @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the performance of the smhps is comparable , or slightly worse , to the one of decoy state with attenuated lasers , because of the already discussed detrimental effect on the source caused by optical switch attenuation . on the other hand ,",
    "the key rate of the amhps is always higher than the one obtained with the attenuated laser in the one decoy scheme and almost reaches the maximum tolerable loss level of the attenuated laser with decoy . as in all previous schemes ,",
    "the amhps shows no improvement after a certain threshold of hs units is reached ( in this case , @xmath100 ) .",
    "the comparison of the two sources in the two different decoy schemes of figure [ fig : decoy ] directly shows the advantage of the amhps over the smhps .    ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 . ]    indeed , the asymmetric scheme performs better than the passive one in both active and passive decoy .",
    "furthermore , the key rate of the amhps in the passive scheme almost equals both the smhps and the attenuated laser with decoy , despite the worse parameter estimation caused by the use of just one decoy state .",
    "the multiple - crystal heralded sources have shown better performance than the attenuated laser in all the studied cases , with the only exception of the smhps in the one decoy scheme , where the high absorption in optical switches , together with an imperfect parameter estimation , completely overrules the enhancement given by the multiple crystal configuration .",
    "the amhps shows better scalability than the smhps , since in the latter the addition of hs units can degrade the performance while in the former it has , in the worst case scenario , no effect .",
    "in addition to this , the key rate of the amhps is generally higher than for the smhps .",
    "the asymmetric structure of the amhps , on the other hand , makes its implementation harder than the smhps , since each crystal much be fed a different pump intensity and the different hs units must be carefully synchronized .",
    "both architectures have shown a stronger dependence of the key rate on optical switch transmittance than on detector efficiency .",
    "the effect of multi - photon pulses , even if less important than for the attenuated laser , still limits the maximum tolerable loss level .",
    "the use of the decoy state solves this problem also for multiple - crystal heralded sources .",
    "the best results are given by active decoy , where a variable optical attenuator and a random number generator are used to change the output statistics .",
    "the much more complex statistics of these sources , however , makes the calculations needed for the determination of the optimal decoy parameters impractical .",
    "therefore , the simplifying assumption of exact determination of the parameters has been adopted and the obtained results just give a superior limit on the attainable key rate .",
    "the optimal decoy parameters must be calculated on a case by case basis , once the characteristics of the source have been chosen .",
    "these limitations might make it preferable the use of a passive decoy scheme , which can be easily implemented in both sources by exploiting the post - selection mechanism . in this case , the optimization has taken into account also the inefficiencies of parameter estimation , thus the obtained results give the effective key rate attainable with each configuration and not just a superior limit .",
    "all the results here presented are subjected to the approximation of infinitely long key .",
    "we leave finite key effects for future studies .",
    "these effects are important especially for the schemes with decoy state , since each photon statistics requires a sufficiently high number of events . in the passive decoy scheme",
    "the effect is still more important , since the need of considering also the relative frequency of the two photon statistics can drastically change the optimal source parameters .",
    "the recent advances in integrated photonics suggest an increasing role of multiple - crystal heralded sources .",
    "if built into a single chip , they might be a valid alternative to lasers in quantum key distribution and other quantum information tasks requiring single photons to work properly .",
