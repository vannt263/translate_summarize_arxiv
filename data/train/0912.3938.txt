    "the ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) is a  nasa small explorer satellite designed to study hard x - rays and gamma - rays from solar flares  @xcite .",
    "it  consists mainly of an imaging tube and a  spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer consists of nine germanium detectors  @xcite .",
    "they are only lightly shielded , thus making rhessi also very useful to detect non - solar photons from any direction .",
    "the energy range sensitive for grb detection extends from about 50  kev up to 20  mev depending on the incoming direction .",
    "energy and time resolutions are excellent for time resolved spectroscopy : @xmath0  =  3  kev ( at 1000 kev ) , @xmath1  =  1  @xmath2s .",
    "the effective area for near axis direction of incoming photons reaches up to 200  @xmath3 at 200  kev . with a field of view of about half of the sky",
    ", rhessi observes about one gamma - ray burst per week ( see also ` http://grb.web.psi.ch ` ) .",
    "totally observed 228 gamma - ray bursts from feb .",
    "2002 to jan .",
    "2006 were used .",
    "originally it was found ( results from batse , konus - wind etc .",
    "instruments  @xcite ) that there exist at least two subclasses of grbs ; the short one with @xmath4 approximately less than 2  s and the long one with @xmath4 approximately more than 2  s , where @xmath4 is the time interval during which the cumulative counts increase from 5% to 95% above background .",
    "as one can see , we obtained distribution with two maxima : about 0.2  s and 15  s. some articles point to existence of the three subclasses of grbs  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated this in the rhessi database .",
    "we fitted one- , two- and three - lognormal functions ( fig .  1 )",
    "and then we used statistical @xmath5-test to evaluate these fits .",
    "this procedure was successfully used on batse catalog ( see  @xcite ) . from the  statistical point of view a  single lognormal",
    "does not fit the  observed distribution .",
    "the  assumption that there is only one subclass is rejected on a  greater than 99.99% significance level .",
    "for the  best fitting with the  two gaussian functions we obtained significance level  =  15.9% .",
    "for the  best fitting with the  three gaussian functions we obtained significance level  =  16.4% .",
    "hence , rhessi data can be interpreted by at least two grb s subgroups .",
    "a  further result is that the short bursts give about 15% of all 228 events observed by rhessi .",
    "the hardness ratio is defined as  the ratio of two fluences @xmath6 in two different energy bands integrated over the  time interval @xmath4 .",
    "specifically we have three energy bands : 25  -  120  kev , 120  -  400  kev and 400  -  1500  kev , and corresponding fluences therein : @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in fig .  1 we show the  hardness - ratio @xmath10 vs. @xmath4 duration for our rhessi dataset .",
    "we confirm the  results of batse ( @xcite ) that on average short grbs are harder .",
    "we plan to use some cluster analysis to exactly decide the  number of subgroups ."
