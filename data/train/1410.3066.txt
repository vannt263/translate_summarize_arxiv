    "dark matter is one of the building blocks of modern cosmology .",
    "the prevailing view states that it corresponds to about @xmath1 of the current matter - energy content being composed by an unknown form of heavy ( @xmath2 gev ) particles which interact very weakly with the remaining cosmic components .",
    "such particles are probably cold relics which induce a large scale background expansion of the form of a cold gas with vanishing kinetic pressure ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this description forms the so called cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario .",
    "although the success in describing the most different astronomical data sets , the full understanding of structure formation process still possess missing concepts .",
    "for example , the small scale problems which appear from pure cdm simulations seem to indicate that actual observed large scale structures are not so clumpy as the theoretically simulated cdm agglomeration pattern .    an alternative proposal like the warm dark matter ( wdm ) scenario , based on fact that dark matter is composed by a lighter particle with mass of order @xmath4 kev , introduces a cut - off on the clustering power at small scales @xcite .",
    "this happens as a consequence of the larger free streaming length of wdm particles during the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "such process `` erases '' small scale structures more efficiently than cdm and could in principle represent a successful dark matter scenario . however , the confirmation of this hypothesis depends on the positive detection of @xmath5 kev particles .",
    "in this paper we study an alternative physical mechanism which can mimic in part the wdm success concerning structure formation but still relying on the hypothesis of cdm particles .",
    "we add a dissipative term to the description of the cdm stress - energy tensor .    from the possible dissipative mechanisms which can be incorporated to the dark matter description ,",
    "only the bulk viscosity @xcite remains compatible with the assumption of large scale homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "the other processes like shear and heat conduction are directional mechanisms and decay as the universe expands .",
    "bulk viscous fluids can originate an accelerated model even without dark energy .",
    "this happens since this mechanism induces an effective negative pressure to the fluid .",
    "therefore , cosmological scenarios where the bulk viscous fluid coexists only with baryons and radiation ( the so called unified models ) have been widely studied @xcite . however , the amount of viscosity needed in the unified scenario in order to accelerate the late time background expansion damages the structure formation process @xcite .",
    "the spherical top - hat collapse was also previously used to confirm such drawbacks faced by a unification scenario based on a bulk viscous fluid @xcite .",
    "therefore , a viable viscous cosmology appears when one uses a usual dark energy component like the cosmological constant to guide the late time expansion whereas only the dark matter fluid is seen as a dissipative fluid .",
    "the proposal of a bulk viscous dark matter component which coexist with a cosmological constant @xmath0 was introduced in @xcite .",
    "we call it @xmath0 viscous cdm model ( @xmath0vcdm )",
    ".    if one keeps the same structure like the standard @xmath0cdm model , i.e. , a dark energy contribution @xmath6 of the today s critical density then the dark matter s viscosity can not be relevant for the background . in some sense , for a viable cosmological expansion , the larger the value of the dark matter s viscosity , the smaller must be the value of the dark energy density .",
    "therefore , the background expansion depends weakly on the magnitude of the dark matter viscosity . on the other hand",
    ", the structure formation process is very sensitive to the viscous mechanism present in the dark matter . the existence of typical dark matter halos in which galaxy formation takes place imposes strong constraints on the magnitude of the dark matter viscosity @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we explore further constraints of the magnitude of the dark matter viscosity by studying other structure formation techniques .",
    "we study the nonlinear evolution of viscous dark matter fluctuations using the spherical collapse model .",
    "this result will also enable us to calculate the mass functions of the model .",
    "rather than finding best fit values , the philosophy of our analysis is to set a maximum values for the magnitude of the viscous . of course , in the case of zero viscosity , our model recovers the @xmath0cdm .",
    "we start presenting the background expansion in the next section .",
    "it will followed by the perturbative study in sections iii ( the top - hat collapse ) and iv ( mass functions ) .",
    "we conclude in the final section .",
    "we are interested in flat flrw background expansions of the type    @xmath7,\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the hubble constant today .",
    "we have defined the fractionary density parameters @xmath9 for the components @xmath10 ( baryons , dark matter and cosmological constant , respectively ) where @xmath11 is the today s critical density .    for the @xmath0vcdm model",
    "we will identify @xmath12 as as viscous component @xmath13 . using the eckart formalism for dissipative fluids @xcite we can assume the existence of a viscous dark matter pressure @xmath14 given by the sum of a kinetic contribution ( @xmath15 ) with the viscous one ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19velocity of the fluid and @xmath20 is the positive coefficient of bulk viscosity .",
    "for this parameter it is usual to adopt the following functional form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 correspond to an arbitrary constants and @xmath24 is the density of the bulk viscous fluid . as usual , the today s values are denoted by the subscript @xmath25 .",
    "the values assumed by these constant parameters are in principle supposed to be positive for thermodynamical reasons @xcite .    for a pure viscous dark matter component",
    "we assume @xmath26 but having in mind that @xmath27 should be very small . in the flrw",
    "metric the bulk viscous pressure reduces to @xmath28 .",
    "the dependence of the pressure @xmath16 on the expansion factor @xmath29 imposes severe difficulties to the search for analytical solutions for this model when fluids other than the viscous one , e.g. , baryons , are present into the dynamics .",

    "@xcite the linear growth of dark matter perturbations was studied .",
    "the primordial amplitude of the perturbations were fixed with help of the camb code @xcite .",
    "the perturbation growth of viscous dark matter halos is scale dependent since it carries a @xmath45 term in the hubble friction part of the equation .",
    "then , the perturbations associated with different scales were allowed to evolve following the differential equation for the viscous linear perturbations .",
    "the smaller the scale , the larger the growth suppression .",
    "the linear perturbations associated with the dwarf galaxies reach the nonlinear stage only if @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , this is a quite conservative result and must be further studied . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of galaxy cluster halos demands @xmath47 .",
    "we shall verify in the next sections how strong are the constraints coming from the nonlinear top - hat collapse and the analysis of the mass functions .",

    "therein we study the evolution of an overdense spherical region collapsing in an expanding universe .",
    "we firstly obtain quantities and equations which are valid for general fluids .    for",

    "hence , the effective expansion rate of the collapsed region can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the peculiar velocity field .",
    "energy conservation is also required for the collapsing region .",
    "therefore , each component @xmath53 obeys a separate equation of the type @xmath54\\frac{\\theta}{a}\\ ] ] where the energy density contrast is defined as @xmath55 and the effective speed of sound is computed following @xmath56 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the homogeneous spherical region will be governed by the raychaudhuri equation @xmath57    in the next subsections we present the specific equations governing the collapse in both @xmath0cdm and @xmath0vcdm universes .",
    "both the baryonic and the dark matter component are assumed to be pressureless fluids .",
    "therefore , we can write down    @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    since baryons and dark matter obey to similar equations one expects that baryonic matter tracks the dark matter potential wells after the decoupling .      let us now consider the collapse of dissipative dark matter . note that pressure of the viscous dark matter fluid is dominated by the nonadiabatic contribution @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath61    in the newtonian context the viscous pressure is @xmath62 therefore its fluctuations read @xmath63    this result leads to a general form for the speed of sound given by @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is viscous equation of state parameter .",
    "note that @xmath66 depends on the divergent of the perturbed velocity field which is a very particular feature of bulk viscous cosmologies .    in order to solve the nonlinear evolution assuming homogeneous fluctuations",
    ", we have to check whether pressure gradients are present .",
    "focusing on the viscous pressure , we have @xmath67 assuming @xmath68 we have @xmath69 hence @xmath70    since at high redshifts the viscous dark matter behaves effectively as pressureless matter , a homogenous profile will not be distorted until the viscosity becomes important , hence @xmath71 will be negligible initially .",
    "moreover , in the most interesting cases @xmath20 is very small .",
    "therefore we can neglect the remaining part of the pressure gradient and assume the usual relation @xmath72 also for the viscous dark matter model . under these conditions",
    "the viscous pressure perturbation is simply @xmath73 . from the above considerations we will study only the case @xmath68 .    thus considering the introduction of the viscous pressure ,",

    "it is therefore expected that for a given value of the bulk viscosity the viscous dark matter proposal will not show the same clustering patterns as the standard cosmology and the so called small scale problems of the typical cdm paradigm would not show up . in particular , our results indicate that the viscous dark matter candidate can be seen as a potential solution for the missing satellites problem @xcite .",
