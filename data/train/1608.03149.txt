    "the recent detection by @xcite of high energy activity from the neutron star ( ns ) 1e  161348@xmath05055  in supernova remnant rcw  103  ( also known as snr g332.4@xmath00.4 ) finally provides insights into its perplexing nature .",
    "@xcite discovered the x - ray point source 1e  161348@xmath05055  using _ einstein _ , but no corresponding optical / ir or radio counterpart has been found to date @xcite , which argues in part against the source being in a binary system .",
    "the age of rcw  103  is @xmath5 @xcite or within the range @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that 1e  161348@xmath05055  pulsates with a period of @xmath7 , with a more definitive and refined detection of 6.67  hr determined by @xcite",
    ". continued monitoring of 1e  161348@xmath05055  yields a constraint on the time derivative of this period of @xmath8 @xcite , which is higher than the @xmath9 of all known isolated pulsars .",
    "the 6.67  hr period makes 1e  161348@xmath05055  a particularly interesting object .",
    "some characteristics of 1e  161348@xmath05055  match those of the central compact object ( cco ) class of nss , which are found near the center of snr and are only seen in x - rays , and thus 1e  161348@xmath05055  had been associated with this class ( see @xcite , for review ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "ccos have an inferred magnetic field @xmath10 , and three ccos have a measured spin period @xmath11 : two have @xmath12 and one has @xmath13 .",
    "if the 6.67  hr period of 1e  161348@xmath05055  is ascribed to its spin , then this value is in sharp contrast to the spin period of ccos .",
    "however the recent high energy activity is very similar to activity seen in another class of nss , that of the magnetars .",
    "magnetars traditionally include two types of nss observed at high energies , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , almost all of which have an inferred magnetic field @xmath14 ( see @xcite , for review ) .",
    "thus it is likely that 1e  161348@xmath05055  also possesses a magnetic field in this range , and hereafter we will assume this is the case . while @xmath15 may be similar to other magnetars , the 6.67  hr period of 1e  161348@xmath05055(which we will assume is its spin period ; see @xcite ) is drastically longer than the spin period of other magnetars , which are all in the range @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , this long period of 1e  161348@xmath05055  could be used to argue against the generation of magnetar - strength magnetic fields via a dynamo mechanism , since this mechanism requires an initial rapid ( possibly millisecond ) spin period @xcite .    in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we present calculations of a simple scenario that can describe the spin evolution of the magnetar 1e  161348@xmath05055 , starting from its birth with a spin period of a millisecond to its current 6.67  hr , and how 1e  161348@xmath05055  is different from other known magnetars .",
    "the scenario is as follows : a supernova gives birth to a rapidly rotating ns .",
    "the rapid spin rate allows us to retain the dynamo mechanism as a viable means to explain the magnetic fields of 1e  161348@xmath05055  and other magnetars @xcite .",
    "we also note that our theoretically conceived millisecond magnetar connects observed magnetars ( that are @xmath17 old ) to those thought to power superluminous supernovae ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "next , after an initial epoch during which the immediate environs surrounding the newborn ns settles into a relatively homogeneous low density plasma and the magnetic field organizes itself into an ordered dipole field , we begin at time @xmath18 with a millisecond magnetar ( with @xmath19 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "this millisecond magnetar evolves as a standard pulsar , i.e. it loses rotational energy and slows down as a result of the ns emitting electromagnetic dipole radiation . for",
    "most known magnetars , this spin - down continues for thousands of years until their present age and produces nss that have a spin period of a few seconds ( see after equation  [ eq : tmag ] ) , just as observed .",
    "in contrast , we propose that for 1e  161348@xmath05055 , there remained some material that was not ejected by the supernova ( we estimate a total mass of about that of the asteroid ceres ; see sect .  [",
    "sec : discuss ] ) , and it forms a remnant disk around the ns ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . the rapid rotation of the ns causes it to be in an ejector state / phase and prevents the remnant disk from interacting with the ns @xcite .",
    "the duration of the ejector phase @xmath20 can be hundreds to thousands of years ( see equation  [ eq : tej ] ) , and all the while the ns emits dipole radiation and its spin period increases .",
    "eventually its rotation becomes slow enough for disk material to couple to the ns magnetosphere , and the ns transitions to a propeller state / phase . in this state ,",
    "matter is expelled by the ( still ) rapidly rotating ns , and the resulting spin - down torque on the ns is much stronger than that due to dipole radiation .",
    "the ns spin period increases at an exponential rate ( see equation  [ eq : spinevolprop ] ) for a short time @xmath21 ( see equation  [ eq : tprop ] ) , before reaching spin equilibrium , when torques on the ns balance . the result is a slowly spinning , strongly magnetized ns , like 1e  161348@xmath05055 .",
    "here we briefly mention previous works which sought to explain the 6.67  hr period of 1e  161348@xmath05055  as its spin period .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) ignore the ejector phase and begin their calculation of propeller phase spin - down at @xmath22 , finding that 1e  161348@xmath05055  has @xmath23 and a remnant disk mass of @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite describe an ejector and propeller evolution scenario and perform monte carlo simulations to obtain the magnetar spin period distribution .",
    "@xcite consider the torque exerted by a binary companion star and find that 1e  161348@xmath05055  has @xmath25 and is in spin equilibrium .",
    "@xcite consider 1e  161348@xmath05055  to have @xmath26 and is accreting from a magnetized remnant disk .",
    "we also note the earlier studies of axps and sgrs as normal magnetic field ( @xmath27 ) nss that are accreting in the propeller phase , but near spin equilibrium , from a fossil disk ( with constant mass ; @xcite ; or with decreasing mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "while in the final stages of preparing our work , we became aware of the work of @xcite , who consider a similar scenario as described here but obtain a much larger disk mass of @xmath28 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "the scenario for the evolution of the 1e  161348@xmath05055  spin period described in section  [ sec : intro ] requires a model for ejector and propeller phases ( defined below ) . at early times in the ejector phase ,",
    "a ns spins down in a similar fashion to an isolated pulsar , i.e. the ns emits electromagnetic dipole radiation and loses rotational energy .",
    "this energy loss produces a torque on the ns @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is spin frequency , @xmath32 is the angle between stellar rotation and magnetic axes , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and we assume the magnetic dipole moment @xmath35 and an orthogonal rotator , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "we take ns mass , radius , and moment of inertia to be @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively . for simplicity",
    "we use the traditional vacuum dipole formula of @xcite .",
    "corrections due to a plasma - filled magnetosphere and in the @xmath32-dependence only introduce changes of order unity ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "torque on the star is defined by @xmath40 , and , without additional sources of torque on the pulsar , the resulting evolution equation for spin frequency is @xmath41 , with solution @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is initial spin frequency and spin - down occurs on the timescale @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinevol ] ) we see that , in isolation , 1e  161348@xmath05055  would spin down to @xmath46 , which coincides with the spin period range @xmath47 of other observed magnetars @xcite but is much shorter than its current spin period of @xmath48 .",
    "this demonstrates that all magnetars except 1e  161348@xmath05055  could simply have spun down to their current spin period via the torque due to electromagnetic dipole radiation ( equation  [ eq : nem ] ) . for 1e  161348@xmath05055 ,",
    "dipole radiation torque is too weak , and a stronger , additional or alternative torque , such as that due to mass accretion , is required to increase its spin period by its current age of a few thousand years .    therefore let us suppose that when 1e  161348@xmath05055  was first born , it was surrounded by a disk of material from , e.g. supernova ejecta that did not escape the system @xcite .",
    "this material can not interact with the pulsar as long as the pulsar light cylinder , defined by radius @xmath49 is smaller than the magnetosphere , whose radial extent is approximately @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , the alfvn radius @xmath52 is derived from balancing ram pressure of the accreting material with pressure of the pulsar magnetic field @xcite , @xmath53 is mass accretion rate , and @xmath54 .",
    "thus this ejector phase takes place when @xmath55 .",
    "the transition between ejector and propeller phases occurs at spin period @xmath56 and the duration of the ejector phase @xmath20 can be estimated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spinevol ] ) and ( [ eq : pspinej ] ) and is @xmath57   \\approx \\frac{{r_{\\rm m}}^2}{2\\beta c^2 }   = 1.5\\times 10^{4}\\mbox { yr } \\xi^2 b_{15}^{-6/7}\\dot{m}_{-12}^{-4/7}.   \\label{eq : tej}\\ ] ]    once @xmath58 , the propeller phase begins , and the total torque on the star is approximately @xmath59 where @xmath60 is accretion ( spin - up ) torque and @xmath61 is propeller ( spin - down ) torque ( see @xcite , for derivation ; see also , e.g. @xcite ; alternative prescriptions for total torque can be found in , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the kepler orbital frequency @xmath62 at the magnetosphere radius has the corresponding period @xmath63 the fastness parameter @xmath64 [ @xmath65 ; @xcite ] determines whether centrifugal force due to stellar rotation ejects matter and spins down the star ( propeller phase with @xmath66 ) or matter accretes and spins up the star ( accretor phase with @xmath67 ) ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the transition between these two phases ( @xmath68 ) is where the total torque is approximately zero and the ns is in spin equilibrium @xcite and occurs at spin period @xmath69 .",
    "the evolution equation for spin frequency is obtained by equating eq .",
    "( [ eq : nprop ] ) to stellar torque @xmath40 , so that ( see also @xcite ) @xmath70   = -\\frac{{\\omega}}{{t_{\\rm prop}}}+\\frac{{\\omega_{\\rm k}}({r_{\\rm m}})}{{t_{\\rm prop}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath71 we can obtain a simple solution of the evolution equation by assuming @xmath72 and @xmath53 are constant ( more sophisticated models with @xmath73 can be found in , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "then the spin frequency as a function of time during the propeller phase , which starts from the end of the ejector phase at time @xmath20 with spin frequency @xmath74 , is @xmath75e^{-(t-{t_{\\rm ej}})/{t_{\\rm prop}}}+{\\omega_{\\rm k}}({r_{\\rm m } } )   \\quad\\mbox{for $ t>{t_{\\rm ej}}$}. \\label{eq : spinevolprop}\\ ] ]    equations  ( [ eq : spinevol ] ) and ( [ eq : spinevolprop ] ) thus describe the complete evolution of ns spin frequency ( or spin period ) through the ejector and propeller phases , respectively .",

    "we note that , as long as @xmath79 , the evolution of spin period is unchanged for any @xmath80 , except at very early times . during the early evolution ( at @xmath81 , depending on @xmath15 and @xmath78 ; see equation  [ eq : tej ] ) , the ns is in the ejector phase , and @xmath82 ( see equation  [ eq : spinevol ] ) . at time",
    "@xmath20 when @xmath83 , the ns magnetosphere can interact with the remnant disk , and the ns enters the propeller phase .",

    "recent observations by @xcite of the x - ray source 1e  161348@xmath05055 in snr rcw  103  strongly suggest it is a magnetar ( ns with @xmath101 ) with an extremely long spin period @xmath102 , in contrast to all other known magnetars which have 212  s spin periods .",
    "the long spin period of 1e  161348@xmath05055  might argue against dynamo generation of magnetic fields because of a requirement for fast ( millisecond ) initial spin periods , and there is insufficient time for 1e  161348@xmath05055  to lose enough rotational energy via conventional electromagnetic dipole radiation .    here",
    "we demonstrate , using a simple model with simple assumptions , that the spin period of 1e  161348@xmath05055  can increase from milliseconds to 6.67  hr over its 1.23.2  kyr lifetime by evolving through ejector and propeller phases while undergoing accretion from a disk .",
    "our calculations show that a young ns , such as 1e  161348@xmath05055 , can spend quite a long time @xmath20 in the ejector phase , and thus this phase should not be neglected . the requisite disk might have remained bound to the ns during its formation in a ( superluminous ) supernova and may have significant impact even when it has very low total mass , which we estimate to be @xmath103",
    ". this disk may still be present or has been completely accreted / dissipated . in the case of the former , since 1e  161348@xmath05055  has evolved to be near spin equilibrium ( when the total torque on the star is approximately zero ) , the long - term @xmath9 is very low and could satisfy the observed constraint of @xmath104 obtained by @xcite .",
    "1e  161348@xmath05055  may on occasion accrete more or less material , which could explain the variability seen in x - rays @xcite .",
    "in fact , our derived @xmath105 corresponds to a luminosity @xmath106 , which is on the order of that observed @xcite .    if the disk is no longer present ( with the observed x - ray variability due to typical magnetar variability ) , then the dipole radiation torque yields @xmath107 , well below the observed constraint .",
    "we also note that , while the exact nature of the mechanism that causes radio emission is uncertain , it is thought that there exists a `` death line '' which demarcates when observable radio emission ceases @xcite .",
    "this death line is shown by dotted lines in figs  [ fig : spinevol ] and [ fig : spinevolmdot ] .",
    "it is clear that , while the ns is in the ejector phase , its spin period is below the death line , and as such , it could emit as a radio pulsar .",
    "however after transition to propeller phase , the spin period rapidly increases above the death line .",
    "thus once the accretion disk material is exhausted and the propeller phase ceases , the ns will not emit as a radio pulsar .",
    "finally , our results suggest a possible unified formation scenario for various classes of observed nss . this scenario is schematically described in table  [ tab : nsform ] and depends on total accreted mass and time spent accreting following a chaotic and turbulent supernova ( a scenario that includes more classes but is a function of accretion rate from a fallback disk is proposed in @xcite ) . for short duration accretion ( hours to possibly days ) of a large amount of mass ( @xmath108 ) ,",
    "accreting matter can build up on the ns surface so fast that the magnetic field is buried temporarily . once accretion slows or stops ,",
    "the magnetic field re - emerges on a timescale of @xmath109 , depending on burial depth , and this increasing surface field could explain properties of ccos @xcite . for small to no accretion ,",
    "we transition from cco formation to pulsars that have possible signatures of magnetic field growth , e.g. their braking index , to the majority of isolated radio pulsars @xcite . in the case of accretion for long durations ,",
    "the magnetic field will not be buried if the total mass is small . for large total mass ( e.g. @xmath110 ,",
    "like that of the disk seen around magnetar 4u  0142 + 61 ; @xcite ) , nss with @xmath111 could end up with @xmath112 in @xmath113 .",
    "however , @xcite show that it is extremely difficult to retain such amounts for long durations during a supernova . for 1e  161348@xmath05055 , only a small amount of mass ( @xmath114 ) needs to be retained following its supernova .",
    "thus 1e  161348@xmath05055  is possibly a very special system , and the interaction of its magnetic field with this small mass over a thousand years is what leads to its long spin period of 6.67  hr .",

    "<S> the x - ray source 1e  161348@xmath05055  in the supernova remnant rcw  103  recently exhibited x - ray activity typical of magnetars , i.e. neutron stars with magnetic fields @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> 161348@xmath05055  has an observed period of 6.67  hr , in contrast to magnetars which have a spin period of seconds . </S>",
    "<S> here we describe a simple model which can explain the spin evolution of 1e  161348@xmath05055 , as well as other magnetars , from an initial period of milliseconds that would be required for dynamo generation of magnetar - strength magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the key difference between 1e  161348@xmath05055  and other magnetars is the persistence of a remnant disk of small total mass . </S>",
    "<S> this disk caused 1e  161348@xmath05055  to undergo ejector and propeller phases in its life , during which strong torques caused a rapid increase of its spin period . by matching its observed spin period and @xmath2  kyr age , we find that 1e  161348@xmath05055has the ( slightly ) highest magnetic field of all known magnetars , with @xmath3 , and that its disk had a mass of @xmath4 , comparable to that of the asteroid ceres .    </S>",
