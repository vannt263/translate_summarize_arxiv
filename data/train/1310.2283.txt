    "subsequently , these types of spectral  galerkin methods have been extended to other domains with spherical geometries , including the 3-dimensional ball @xcite . meanwhile , mixed jacobi - fourier spectral method are presented for elliptic equations on a disk @xcite and a mixed jacobi - harmonic spectral approximation is proposed in @xcite for a navier - stokes equation in a ball .",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive review of spectral methods and their special treatments in polar / spherical coordinates .",
    "moreover , an alternative approach for solving differential equations in a smooth domain is to map the domain into the unit ball and then apply a spectral method @xcite .",

    "the second author of this paper studied sobolev orthogonal polynomials on a unit ball @xcite , which leads to a tri - diagonal linear system for second order elliptic equation with constant coefficients , as can be seen below .",

    "one of the challenging problems in the spectral methods on the unit ball is to measure and estimate the errors of approximation in genuine , instead of anisotropic , sobolev norms .",
