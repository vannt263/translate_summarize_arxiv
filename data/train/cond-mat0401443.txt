    "since long time financial data have been widely studied by economists , mathematicians and , more recently , by physicists @xcite .",
    "the variations of these financial time series can be seen as stochastic processes where a set of financial quantities is varying in time as consequence of underlying economic changes .",
    "the present availability of enormous sets of financial data allows to get increasingly important insights on the complex behavior of these systems starting from empirical studies .",
    "these investigations are leading to more and more accurate results on risk assessment and search for market imperfections .",
    "one of the important points in these analyses is to individuate similarities and specificities among the analyzed financial time series .",
    "this search has been widely exploited for stocks price changes whereas interest rates have been less investigated @xcite . for several economic reasons , interest rates and bonds have very similar statistical behavior in time or , in other words , they are all highly correlated .",
    "their multivariate dynamics has been studied with a correlation - based clustering procedure in a set of us treasury securities where an underlying hierarchical structure has been detected @xcite .",
    "here we investigated a partially different and less homogeneous set to evaluate the degree of hierarchal organization among different time series in a diversified group of bonds .",
    "we investigate weekly data for 34 selected interest rate time series recorded in the federal reserve ( fr ) statistical release database @xcite . in the following",
    "we will indicate these time series with the symbol @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the current date and @xmath5 is a number which labels the different time series ( see tab.[t.1 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding interest rates associated with these clusters are summarized in first column ( 1982 - 1997 ) of fig.[f.delta ] ( right ) where the ultra - metric distances at which the nucleation process starts and ends for each cluster are also indicated .",
    "as one can see , the empirical analysis allow us to distinguish several different clusters that gather together meaningful quantities :    * all the interest rates with maturities equal to 1 months ; * all the interest rates with maturities 3 and 6 months with distinctions for the treasury securities at ` constant maturity ' ( tc ) , treasury bill rates ( tba ) and treasury bill secondary market rates ( tbs ) ; * all the interest rates with maturities between 1 and 3 years ; * all the interest rates with maturities larger than 3 years .",
    "fig.[f.ficlust ] reports the plot for the interest rates time series @xmath6 grouped into the different sets retrieved from the cluster analysis described above .",
    "for some of the series the data - collapse is impressive , indicating that the correlations inside the clusters are strong in any part of the analyzed period .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate whether a cluster structure , similar to the one obtained for the period 1982 - 1997 , could be retrieved from an analysis on shorter periods .",
    "this is of course a delicate point since the fragmentation of the data sets will increase the fluctuations due to the noise .",
    "we choose to divide the whole period 1982 - 1997 in four smaller periods of 4 years .",
    "the results are reported in fig.[f.delta ] ( right ) where it is evident how the cluster structure is mostly conserved ( and partially modified ) in this 4-years period analysis . in conclusion , from the analysis of different kinds of interest rates in money and capital markets , referring to government , private , industries securities and commitments , we have shown how the used clustering linkage procedure is useful to detect differences and analogies among these tangled correlated data .",
