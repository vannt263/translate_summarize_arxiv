    "in the recent years the focus of applications of the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite has shifted towards the processes with the essentially minkowskean kinematics . perhaps , the most well - known example is the theory of inclusive decays of heavy flavors ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "this fact , as well as the increased demand for more accurate predictions , puts forward the study of the quark - hadron duality as an urgent task .",
    "a detailed definition of the procedure which goes under the name of the quark - hadron duality ( a key element of every calculation referring to minkowskean quantities ) was given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in a nut shell ,",
    "a _ truncated _ ope is analytically continued , term by term , from the euclidean to the minkowski domain . a smooth quark curve obtained in this way",
    "is supposed to coincide at high energies ( energy releases ) with the actual hadronic cross section .    if duality is formulated in this way , it is perfectly obvious that at finite energies deviations from duality must exist .",
    "the difference between the measured physical cross section and a smooth ope prediction will be referred to as an oscillating / exponential ( duality violating ) component . in ref . @xcite it was shown that if we knew the leading asymptotic behavior of the high order terms in the power series we could evaluate this component .",
    "unfortunately , very little is known about this aspect of ope , and we have to approach the problem from the other side  either by modeling the phenomenon @xcite or by studying some general features of the appropriate spectral densities .",
    "one can also try to approach the problem purely phenomenologically ( for recent attempts see e.g. @xcite ) .    an illustrative spectral density , quite instructive in the studies of the issue of the quark - hadron duality ,",
    "was suggested in @xcite , = _ n=1^ ( e - n ) [ modim ] where @xmath5 and from now on we will drop an inessential constant in front of the sum .",
    "the color factor @xmath6 is singled out for convenience .",
    "the imaginary part above represents , for positive values of @xmath7 , a sum of infinitely narrow equidistant resonances , with equal residues .",
    "the distance between the resonances is @xmath8 .",
    "it defines @xmath9 everywhere in the complex plane @xmath10 , through the standard dispersion relation , up to an additive constant which can be adjusted arbitrarily .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the corresponding correlation function ( q^2 ) = - [ msmodel ] where @xmath11 is the logarithmic derivative of euler s gamma function , and @xmath12 in the minkowski domain @xmath13 is positive , in the euclidean domain @xmath14 is positive .",
    "then , the asymptotic expansion of @xmath15 in deep euclidean domain is well known , ( q^2 ) - where @xmath16 are the bernoulli numbers . at large @xmath17",
    "they grow factorially , as @xmath18 ( see @xcite , page 23 ) .",
    "we deal with the sign alternating series .",
    "although the spectral density ( [ modim ] ) is admittedly a model , it was argued @xcite that a similar factorial growth of the coefficients in the power ( condensate ) series is a general feature .",
    "the spectral density ( [ modim ] ) may be relevant in the limit of the large number of colors , @xmath19 , when all mesons are infinitely narrow .",
    "this limit is not realistic , however .",
    "moreover , in this limit the _ local _ quark - hadron duality , as we defined it , _ never _ takes place since even at high energies the hadronic spectral density never becomes smooth , even approximately .",
    "one can smear it by hand , of course , but then deviations from the local duality will be determined not only by the intrinsic hadronic dynamics , as is the case in the real world , but also by particular smearing procedure  they will depend on the weight function chosen for smearing , the interval of smearing and so on . in the actual world",
    "the smearing occurs _ dynamically _ , since at high energies the resonance widths become non - negligible .",
    "the limits of @xmath20 and @xmath19 are not interchangeable .    here",
    "we suggest and study more realistic ( dynamically smeared ) spectral densities compatible with all general properties of quantum chromodynamics . starting from infinitely narrow resonances , as in eq .",
    "( [ modim ] ) , we introduce finite widths , ensuring smooth behavior .",
    "technically , in the first part of the paper the problem of duality is analyzed in the two - dimensional t hooft model @xcite ( see also @xcite ",
    "the quark confinement in this model is built - in .",
    "we then try to abstract general features of this solution , which may persist in qcd . in the second part of the paper an attempt is made to work out the same mechanism in four dimensions .",
    "dynamical  smearing \" of the spectral densities taking part in qcd due to nonvanishing resonance widths , exhibits the same features of the high - energy behavior as was suggested in refs . [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] on the basis of rather naive models , e.g. instanton models .",
    "namely , the approach of the spectral density to the smooth limit ( the deviation from duality ) is exponential , with oscillations .",
    "this pattern seems to be general and may be considered now as a well - established model - independent fact . at the same time , the exponent determining the rate of the damping of the duality violations depends on details of the large distance dynamics .",
    "we were unable to find it from first principles , and had to settle for model - dependent determinations .",
    "let us note that several useful results on the relation between duality violations and the divergence of the power expansion were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we incorporate them . the very idea of using the t hooft model as a theoretical laboratory adequate to the problem was formulated there .",
    "moreover , it was noted @xcite that the leading asymptotics of the high - order coefficients does not require the knowledge of the exact mass spectrum .",
    "suffice it to know the leading term in the @xmath17 dependence , where @xmath17 is the radial excitation number , which immediately translates in the leading factorial behavior of the coefficients . in particular , the position of the low - lying states is irrelevant in the regime with the factorially growing coefficients .",
    "this is a specific feature of the asymptotic series .",
    "the @xmath11 function model was originally suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for the heavy - light quark systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that it was more appropriate for the light - light quark systems since in the heavy - light systems the resonances are not expected to be equidistant .",
    "straightforward quasiclassical estimates yield in this case that the meson energies ( measured from the heavy quark mass ) asymptotically scale as @xmath21 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly reminds the basic strategy of the ope - based calculations .",
    "here we outline the main elements of the analysis to be opresented below . in sect .",
    "3 we first discuss the t hooft model in the leading @xmath22 approximation . then we calculate the resonance widths and evaluate the polarization operator of the two scalar currents in taking into account 1/@xmath6 corrections . in sect .",
    "4 we present qualitative arguments why the implementation of duality obtained in the t hooft model must be also relevant , at a qualitative level , in four - dimensional qcd . sect .",
    "5 gives conclusions and outlines possible physical applications of our results .",
    "the issue of  deviations from duality \" caused much confusion in the recent literature .",
    "therefore , to begin with , we remind the basic strategy revealing , in clear terms , where the deviations can occur and where there can be no deviations .",
    "first of all , all calculations based on the operator product expansion are carried out in the euclidean domain . only away from the physical cuts this procedure is well - defined .",
    "any calculation consists of several crucial elements : identification of the operators which can appear in the expansion , separation of hard virtual momenta ( higher than a normalization point @xmath23 ) from soft virtual momenta ( lower than @xmath23 ) and , finally , calculation of the expansion coefficients in front of relevant operators .",
    "the latter is carried out in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "that is why the normalization point @xmath23 must be chosen sufficiently high , and the calculation must be done in the euclidean domain . even if in some problems calculations are conveniently presented in such a way",
    "as if they were done in the minkowski domain , actually the corresponding results must be understood as an analytic continuation .",
    "the connection between the euclidean predictions and measurable quantities is established _ via _ dispersion relations . in this way",
    "one can get certain sum rules .",
    "a large variety of them is offered on the market .",
    "if the euclidean quantity is appropriately chosen , the ( euclidean ) operator product expansion _",
    "converges_. the best - known example of such an appropriate choice is provided by the svz sum rules @xcite obtained by virtue of the borel transformation of the dispersion representation .",
    "consider , for instance , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , see eq .",
    "( [ msmodel ] ) .",
    "the @xmath24 expansion of @xmath25 in the euclidean domain is factorially divergent . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath26 expansion of the borel - transformed quantity has a finite radius of convergence .",
    "indeed , the svz sum rule in the case at hand has the form = ^-s / m^2 i m ( s ) ds , [ sr ] ( in the right - hand side @xmath8 plays the role of the inverse slope of the regge trajectory ) .",
    "assume that the left - hand side was calculated theoretically , using ope , as an expansion in @xmath26 .",
    "the domain of convergence of the power expansion is determined by the position of the nearest singularity in the complex @xmath27 plane .",
    "it is quite obvious that the expansion converges at |m^2| > .",
    "[ rc ] not only the radius of convergence is finite , due to the factor @xmath28 in the denominator the domain of convergence extends to quite low values of @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath29 1 to 2 gev@xmath4 , the power series is convergent at as low values of @xmath27 as 0.4 gev@xmath4 .",
    "this fact was empirically observed long ago @xcite .",
    "if we consider the svz sum rule inside the convergence domain of ope ( see eq . ( [ rc ] ) , and are aimed at predicting the exponential integral on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) _ per se _ , it is meaningless to speak about deviations from ope . in this formulation of the problem",
    "_ there are no deviations_.    the problem of deviations arises when we try to predict the spectral density i m @xmath30 point - by point , at large @xmath7 , or certain integrals of i m @xmath30 , not directly reducible to  good \" sum rules of the type ( [ sr ] ) . certainly , if we assume that i m @xmath30 is smooth starting from some boundary value @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) allows us to predict i m @xmath32 at @xmath33 unambiguously .",
    "if an oscillating component is allowed , however , one can always invent such a wild oscillating function , which , being integrated with the exponential weight , gives a contribution on the left - hand side of the sum rule ( [ sr ] ) less than the last term of the power expansion retained , no matter how small this last term is .",
    "this component is referred to as duality - violating .",
    "clearly , quantum chromodynamics admits only very specific oscillating / exponential components in the spectral densities , if at all .",
    "the question is what particular oscillating / exponential functions are allowed by qcd dynamics .",
    "we first try to answer this question in a simpler context of the t hooft model , and then pass to discussion of qcd .",
    "the aim of this section is to study the quark - hadron duality in the t hooft model .",
    "we shall first briefly review the t hooft model in the @xmath34 limit and discuss @xmath22 corrections in this model .",
    "our original contribution is calculating the resonance widths for high excitations .",
    "then , using these widths , we suggest an _ ansatz _ for the asymptotic behavior of the polarization operator of two scalar currents , based on the breit - wigner approximation . this resonance - saturated polarization operator will be referred to as phenomenological .",
    "we will confront it with the truncated power expansion .",
    "the difference between these two expressions gives an idea of the duality violation .",
    "two - dimensional qcd is described by the lagrangian @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the flavor index .",
    "since the multiflavor aspect is irrelevant for our problem , we shall consider , for simplicity , one flavor ; correspondingly , the index @xmath36 will be omitted hereafter . if the gauge coupling of the theory is @xmath37 , it is convenient to introduce an effective coupling , @xmath38 which stays constant in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath37 has dimension of mass ; it sets the scale for all dimensional quantities in the chiral limit , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "we introduce the scale @xmath40 and measure all quantities in these units , e.g. the quark mass @xmath41 while the mass of the @xmath17-th meson @xmath42 and so on .",

    "the oscillating component is suppressed by the damping exponential , exp @xmath127 .",
    "a comment is in order regarding the exponent , .",
    "[ exp1 ] this exponent determines the boundary between the oscillation and the resonance zones , @xmath128 .",
    "this estimate is in accord with intuition .",
    "indeed , the exponential suppression of the oscillations should start when the resonance width becomes larger than the distance between the neighboring resonances .",
    "since @xmath129 and the distance between the neighboring resonances @xmath130 , this occurs at the excitations number @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ exp1 ] ) is obvious .",
    "what is more remarkable , is a large additional numerical suppression , @xmath132 , pushing the boundary to higher energies and making the exponential suppression weaker .",
    "it can be traced back to the numerical suppression of the width in eq .",
    "( [ widths ] ) which , in turn , is due to a strong numerical suppression of the phase space . because of this fact the damping of the oscillations occurs very slowly in the t hooft model .",
    "figure 4 shows i m @xmath30 in the window from the 35-th to 65-th oscillation .",
    "we see that even here the oscillation amplitude is quite sizable .",
    "unlike other features , expected to be generic , this numerical aspect  a very slow rate of the oscillation damping  is specific to the t hooft model and is not expected to survive in four - dimensional qcd , since it is entirely due to  abnormally \" narrow widths of the resonances in two - dimensional qcd .",
    "semiquantitative estimates of the damping exponent in four - dimensional qcd will be given in sect .",
    "4 .    in summary , for @xmath133 the polarization operator is given by the @xmath134 function of the positive real argument and is a smooth function with no singularities .",
    "it is well approximated by its asymptotic expansion .",
    "the latter is most conveniently written in terms of the variable @xmath117 defined above ( see eq .",
    "( [ tilde ] ) ) , for which it becomes the standard asymptotic expansion of the @xmath11 function . in the minkowskean domain , starting from the scale @xmath135 , one can approximate the polarization operator by its smooth asymptotics ( analytically continued from the expansion in the euclidean domain ) _ plus _ an exponentially decreasing and oscillating term ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "unlike the  t hooft model , we can not solve four - dimensional qcd . at the qualitative level , however , we can apply the same ideas",
    ". the general pattern of the asymptotic behavior will be the same , but the numerical aspects look different .    our goal in this section is to discuss the polarization operator of two vector currents : _ ( q^2 ) = i0t\\{j_(x ) j _ ( 0)}0d^4x .",
    "[ pol4 ] here @xmath136 is the vector current , j_(x)=|u_d(x ) .",
    "[ current ] due to the conservation of the vector current the polarization operator can be represented as _",
    "( q^2)= ( q^q^-q^2g_)(q^2 ) .",
    "[ polarisation ] furthermore , @xmath9 is dimensionless , and is perfectly analogous to the polarization operator ( 21 ) we dealt with in the t hooft model . according to the standard wisdom of multicolor qcd , we expect that at @xmath118 and high energies @xmath9 is representable as a sum of equidistant infinitely narrow resonances , with a constant residue , i.e. we arrive at the same @xmath11 function .",
    "the dynamical smearing is again provided by the resonance widths ( a @xmath22 effect ) .",
    "what is known about the widths of the highly excited states in four - dimensional qcd ?    in the case at hand we do not have in our disposal quantitative tools which would allow us to calculate the widths .",
    "such a calculation could have been performed in a non - critical string theory , were this theory available .",
    "unfortunately , the issue is not worked out , and we have to resort to qualitative arguments .",
    "if the string - based picture of color confinement is indeed valid , one can hardly avoid the conclusion that the resonance widths must grow linearly with @xmath137 @xcite , much in the same way as in the t hooft model .",
    "let us remind quasiclassical arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that @xmath138 in four - dimensional qcd .",
    "when a highly excited meson state is created by a local source , it can be considered , quasiclassically , as a pair of ( almost free ) ultrarelativistic quarks ; each of them with energy @xmath139 .",
    "these quarks are created at the origin , and then fly back - to - back , creating behind them a flux tube of the chromoelectric field .",
    "the length of the tube @xmath140 where @xmath8 is the string tension .",
    "the decay probability is determined , to order @xmath22 , by the probability of creating an extra quark - antiquark pair .",
    "since the pair creation can happen anywhere inside the flux tube , it is natural to expect that _",
    "n~ l^2=m_n [ ? ] where @xmath141 is a dimensionless coefficient of order one .",
    "let us note in passing that the @xmath89 corrections due to creation of two quark pairs are of order @xmath142 within this picture .",
    "since @xmath143 , the expansion parameter is @xmath144 .    strictly speaking , the estimate ( [ ? ] ) must be , rather , viewed as a lower bound , since the transverse fluctuations of the flux tube can increase the decay probability .",
    "however , most likely , these transverse fluctuations will materialize in the form of emission of glueballs , a subleading @xmath89 effect , which is not considered here .",
    "it is not fully clear what impact these fluctuations may have on the quark - antiquark pair production .",
    "it seems plausible that they only affect the numerical coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ ? ] ) , which is not calculated anyway . given all naivet of the arguments and the estimate ( [ ? ] ) , at the present stage it is reasonable to accept it as a working hypothesis .",
    "as was mentioned , in real qcd we expect @xmath145 , see estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite and below .",
    "apart from this numerical difference , everything else is perfectly analogous to the consideration we have carried out in the t hooft model .",
    "hence , we conclude that in four - dimensional qcd a viable model of the approach to asymptotics is provided by the same @xmath11 function ( q^2)-(0)=const . ( ) , [ pi ] where in the case at hand =( ) ^1- + c .",
    "[ o ] here @xmath146 is a numerical constant correlated with the position of the lowest resonance , @xmath147 the normalization constant in front of the @xmath11 function in eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) will be chosen in the form @xmath148 so that the imaginary part at asymptotically high @xmath7 is automatically normalized to unity",
    ". the plot of i m @xmath30 is shown on fig .",
    "although fine details of this spectral density are somewhat distorted compared to the actual experimentally measured spectral densities in the @xmath149 annihilation or @xmath150 decays ( e.g. the @xmath151 meson width comes out @xmath152 larger than the experimental one ) the qualitative similarity of our model with experiment is remarkable . to substantiate the point we display a plot of the spectral density in the vector isoscalar channel borrowed from ref .",
    "@xcite ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "the oscillation zone starts at @xmath153 . above this boundary the asymptotic form of the oscillating exponential terms , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , is given by ( q^2)=const . .",
    "[ tt ] both , the onset of the oscillation zone and the oscillation structure are in nice qualitative agreement with what we see on fig .",
    "6 presenting experimental data on @xmath149 annihilation and @xmath150 decays .    in summary , our model",
    "spectral density ( [ o ] ) , with the appropriate values of parameters , properly captures all important features which must be inherent to spectral densities in real qcd .",
    "first , the corresponding polarization operator is a sum of an infinite number of simple poles on the unphysical sheet , so that the correct analytical properties ensue automatically .",
    "the @xmath24 expansion has the right structure . the spectral density following from eqs .",
    "( [ pi ] ) and ( [ o ] ) is dynamically smeared by the resonance widths .",
    "purely pictorially it closely resembles what is measured experimentally .",
    "in this paper we address the issue of the preasymptotic component of the spectral density not seen in practical ope .",
    "this component oscillates , with the amplitude being exponentially damped .",
    "the approach to the problem is complementary to that of refs .",
    "@xcite . it is gratifying to observe that the general features of the overall picture come out the same as in the previous analyses .",
    "details are different .",
    "for instance , the instanton - based model discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite yields the interval between the successive oscillations growing with @xmath7 , while our present result implies equidistant oscillations in the @xmath7 scale . in this aspect",
    "the instanton - based model is seemingly less realistic .",
    "moreover , for obvious reasons it does not allow one to trace the proper @xmath6 dependence , while our present analysis does .",
    "needless to say that it reproduces the desired regularity  the fact that the exponent governing the exponential damping of the oscillations is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "the important lesson we draw is confirmation of a general pattern of the duality - violating component in the spectral densities at high energies inferred previously : exponential character , modulated by oscillations .",
    "particular details are model - dependent .",
    "the t hooft model is solvable , and all questions can be explicitely answered . in four - dimensional qcd",
    "it is possible to provide only educated guesses .",
    "further efforts are needed to back them up by more solid calculations .",
    "we believe that the suggested _ ansatz _ for the spectral density , eqs .",
    "( [ pi ] ) and ( [ o ] ) , gives a very good idea of the duality - violating contributions .",
    "it is compatible with all general principles of field theory , @xmath22 expansion of qcd , and folklore knowledge which is universally believed to be true .",
    "although our discussion was phrased in terms of the spectral densities , its implications are wider . in particular",
    ", it is quite probable that a component of the very same structure is present in the so called hard quantities without ope , e.g. thrust .",
    "recently it was realized that the perturbative predictions for such quantities must be supplemented by @xmath154 corrections ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if we are right , in the intermediate domain of moderate momentum transfers the oscillating component might be noticeable too .",
    "an interesting question which deserves a new dedicated analysis ( independently of our model of duality - violating contributions ) is the behavior of the resonance widths as a function of the excitation number at high @xmath17 in multicolor four - dimensional qcd .",
    "another obvious direction of expansion is combining the @xmath11 function _ ansatz _ ( [ pi ] ) with information on specific low - dimension condensates which might allow one to obtain a fully realistic description of the polarization operator in the entire complex plane .",
