    "the lead isotopes provide a unique laboratory to study the phenomenon of shape coexistence in nuclei @xcite and have very recently been subject of much experimental and theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "the combined effect of the proton shell - gap at @xmath1=82 for the pb - nuclei and the large number of valence nucleons outside the closed @xmath2=126 core ( in this case , neutron holes ) , results in an important lowering of the energy of proton particle - hole excitations @xcite .",
    "more specifically , near neutron midshell ( at @xmath2=104 ) , the proton 2p-2h and 4p-4h excitations descend to very low excitation energy because of the very large proton - neutron binding energy that results from the interactions between the core - excited protons across the @xmath1=82 shell closure and the large number of valence neutrons outside of the @xmath2=126 shell closure . as a consequence , mixing can result between various families of configurations having approximately the same excitation energy .",
    "more in particular , the lowest - lying @xmath3 and @xmath4 states can become strongly mixed such that it is very difficult to assign a configuration label to them . in section [",
    "sect : mix ] , we succintly describe the essentials of the configuration mixing using the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite.in section [ sect : be2values ] we have in mind to obtain a better understanding in the nature of the low - spin collective states and to construct particular bands by making use of the calculated e2 decay probabilities starting at the high - spin states in the particular case of @xmath0pb . in a final section [",
    "sect : rotor ] , we use the calculated values ( using the ibm ) for quadrupole moments and b(e2)-values in these bands in order to extract collective model parameters ( intrinsic quadrupole moments , quadrupole deformation @xmath5 ) in order to highlight the equivalence between the ibm approach , used as a highly - truncated shell - model calculation , and a geometrical rotational model , as can be derived from mean - field methods @xcite .",
    "in a recent study that concentrated on describing intruder bands and configuration mixing in the neutron deficient pb - isotopes , a three - configuration mixing calculation has been performed in the context of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite .",
    "we refer to that paper for more details but present succintly the main points . approximating the regular and intruder states as built from proton 0p-0h , 2p-2h and 4p-4h excitations across the @xmath1=82 proton closed shell mainly that interact with the large number of valence neutrons outside of the n=126 neutron closed shell , the hamiltonian within the ibm takes the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 the quadrupole operator @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 for details on the notation we refer to fossion et al . @xcite .",
    "the diagonalisation of the energy matrices , corresponding to the hamiltonian , is carried out in the @xmath11-basis , expressing the eigenvectors in the [ @xmath2]@xmath13[@xmath14@xmath13[@xmath15 model space .",
    "unfortunately , using this method , one has no clear insight in the amount of mixing between the unperturbed bands that result from a diagonalisation in the separate subspaces [ @xmath2 ] , [ @xmath14 , and [ @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "+   + so instead of a complete diagonalisation of the hamiltonian matrix , we first rotate into an intermediate basis in which the separate parts of the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 only , become diagonal .",
    "we thus have three different bases : +    * the _ u(5)-basis _ @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the angular momentum , @xmath2 the number of bosons and @xmath21 the rank number , * the basis in which the full hamiltonian is diagonal @xmath22 , and , * the _ intermediate bases _ in which the hamiltonian ( excluding @xmath23 ) is diagonal in the three different subspaces [ @xmath2],[@xmath14 , and [ @xmath15 .",
    "respectively they are denoted as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 also a rank number .",
    "the above bases are connected in the following way .",
    "the basis in which the full hamiltonian is diagonal ( expressed in the @xmath11-basis ) reads @xmath28 and the ` intermediate ' basis becomes @xmath29 ( similarly for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "dim@xmath32 , dim@xmath33 , and dim@xmath34 are the dimensions of the corresponding configuration spaces for a certain angular momentum @xmath20 containing @xmath2 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 bosons respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath35 diagonalises the configuration with @xmath2 bosons and the matrix @xmath36 diagonalises the full hamiltonian directly ( the indices @xmath2 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for matrix @xmath36 are only added for the sake of clearness ) .",
    "we omit the dimensions of the summations from now on .",
    "rotation of the hamiltonian matrix expressed in the @xmath11-basis into the ` intermediate ' basis results in the energy levels of a set of bands in the 0p-0h , 2p-2h and 4p-4h subspaces separately ( see also left part in fig .",
    "[ fig : ibmspectrum ] ) .",
    "these bands correspond to the unperturbed bands that are extracted in phenomenological calculations as carried out by dracoulis _ _ et al.__@xcite , allatt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and page _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . from now on we will call the energy levels ( bands ) resulting from rotation of the hamiltonian matrix into the ` intermediate ' basis unperturbed levels ( bands ) in order to avoid confusion and we will denote them as the @xmath37 states ( see eq . ) . + by calculating the mixing matrix elements of @xmath23 in this ` intermediate ' basis , we obtain the mixing matrix elements for all unperturbed levels .",
    "the knowledge of these unperturbed bands and their mixing matrix elements makes the process of configuration mixing in a nucleus more transparent than before .",
    "starting from the experimental level energies at high spin and the corresponding moment of inertia , a set of unperturbed experimental bands can be deduced extrapolating to the low - spin members of these bands @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the ibm unperturbed bands and these extrapolated unperturbed experimental bands , together with the knowledge of the full energy spectrum and the b(e2)-values form an extensive test for the parameters that describe a certain isotope chain .",
    "+   + starting from ibm - parameters for the pb - isotopes as determined by fossion _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , a slightly different fit was performed .",
    "the parameters for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 remain unchanged , except for @xmath38 which was taken 0.92 mev instead of 0.90 mev .",
    "the mixing parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 were fixed in @xmath41pb .",
    "the value for @xmath42 was obtained as the result of a fitting procedure for the pb - isotopes ( @xmath43=186 - 196 ) .",
    "basically @xmath42 was fitted for @xmath44pb and @xmath41pb and the @xmath42 for the other isotopes was chosen following a linear variation between @xmath42(@xmath44pb ) and @xmath42(@xmath41pb ) .",
    "then , the difference between the experimental @xmath45 and the ibm @xmath45 was taken for all isotopes considered and added to the corresponding @xmath42 .",
    "this method gives a better description of the slope of the energy levels through the isotope chain .",
    "moreover , the @xmath42(@xmath0pb ) obtained in this way is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction that makes use of experimental separation energies @xcite .",
    "since @xmath46 is associated with the unperturbed energy to excite 4p-4h configurations , the value was taken as 2@xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the parameters for @xmath0pb are listed in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    ".ibm - parameters used for @xmath0pb . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we come to the question about labelling the mixed states , resulting from diagonalisation of the full hamiltonian , in a meaningful way into a given band . as the criterium , we start from the calculated high - spin members of the two bands and follow the e2-decay .",
    "we define the collective band through a sequence of e2-transitions down to low spin such that the intra - band b(e2)-values are bigger than the inter - band b(e2)-values .",
    "moreover in the case of @xmath0pb , we have as a second criterium the fact that the intra - band transitions between higher spin ( and thus relatively unperturbed ) states should exhibit an approximately constant behaviour as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsband ] .",
    "the final results are shown in figure [ fig : levelscheme ] . in table",
    "[ tab : twoplus ] all inter - band transitions involving the ibm @xmath48 at 969 kev ( not drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : levelscheme ] ) are shown .",
    "the transitions between band ii and band iii in figure [ fig : levelscheme ] that are not shown , are less than 1 w.u .",
    "we like to stress that the 725 kev @xmath3 state in figure [ fig : levelscheme ] is indicated with a dashed line and tentative energy .",
    "this state was identified in two experimental studies @xcite , but recently performed experiments @xcite do not reach conclusive evidence for this state and its energy .",
    "the position and existence of this level thus is still under discussion . +   + comparing the ibm results with the experimental bands , we notice that the structure of the collective bands is reproduced rather well .",
    "the energy levels that constitute the more collective band ii are in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the structure of the band iii is also described rather well although the value of @xmath49 seems a bit too small and the mixing parameter between the two intruder configurations slightly too large .",
    "although the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 state are placed in the collective bands the other way round in reference @xcite , here we switched them .",
    "this change was performed following the definition that inter - band transitions must be small compared to intra - band transitions . in the other case than the one depicted here , the ibm - calculations give transitions from the collective band iii to the regular ground state that are larger and thus more collective than the transition to the @xmath3 state of band iii itself .",
    "such a decay pattern should definitely be discarded .",
    "the only way to obtain a consistent picture in which the e2-transitions exhibit a collective nature within the collective bands and give rise to small e2-transitions between the different bands , is by associating the @xmath45 level to band ii and the @xmath51 level to band iii .",
    "+   + when we take a closer look at the e2-transitions between the low - lying levels , something interesting occurs . using expression ( [ eq : nr2 ] ) , one can single out those contributions of the reduced matrix elements for the transitions in the unperturbed bands ( thus reduced matrix element and coefficient ! ) , that make up the major contribution to a given transition @xmath52 with the condition that their sum may not deviate more than 10% from the total value with all contributions taken into account .    in the case of @xmath0pb",
    ", it turns out that for the so constructed band ii and band iii , the main contribution to intra - band transitions always consists of the term with the corresponding lowest rank transition in the unperturbed 2p-2h band and the one in the unperturbed 4p-4h band .",
    "thus    @xmath53    with @xmath54 and @xmath55 both states in band ii or both states in band iii .",
    "this fact is as expected .",
    "more interesting is the ratio @xmath1 of those two main contributions to the total value of the reduced matrix element .",
    "these results are depicted in figure [ fig : contributions ] .",
    "+   + notice that the ratio @xmath56 becomes larger than the ratio @xmath57 for the @xmath58 transition in band iii .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the fact that we placed the @xmath59 and @xmath51 states in band iii as for all other transitions in this bands @xmath57 dominates over @xmath56 .",
    "however , all other orderings of these levels into the bands ( ii and iii ) are in contradiction with the e2-decay pattern and our definition of intra - band and inter - band transitions strengths in order to define a collective band .",
    "this very large ratio @xmath56 for the @xmath58 transition in band iii is due to the combined effect of the large mixing and the relative magnitudes of the two contributing reduced matrix elements .",
    "+   + so we can conclude that the only physically meaningful way to characterise the low - lying states is by constructing the different bands using the intensities of the sequences of e2-transitions . attempts to label the extremely mixed low - lying states as 2p-2h or 4p-4h lead to inconsistencies",
    "having constructed two different collective bands starting from the ibm and using the prescription to define bands on the basis of the calculated b(e2)-values , it is very useful to check for consistency with the results of other theoretical approaches .",
    "first of all we concentrate on the quadrupole moments . +   + within the ibm , the quadrupole moments are calculated as @xmath60 from the point of view of the collective rotational model@xcite , the electric quadrupole moment is defined as @xmath61 for @xmath62 bands this reduces to @xmath63 with the intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath64 defined as @xmath65 equating the quadrupole moments of equation and allows us to extract an equivalent intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath64 .",
    "likewise one can use the ibm b(e2)-values to extract an equivalent intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath64 using the collective rotational model b(e2)-expression @xmath66 having extracted an intrinsic quadrupole moment , one can deduce a deformation parameter @xmath5 using the expression @xmath67 if the concept of a collective band characterised by a single @xmath64 value is to make sense , one expects that values of @xmath64 extracted with these two procedures will not differ much .",
    "moreover , one expects only a moderate variation of @xmath64 as a function of j along the band .    .",
    "results for the 2p-2h unperturbed band are represented with @xmath68 , results for the 4p-4h unperturbed band with @xmath69 .",
    "bands ii and iii are represented respectively by @xmath70 and @xmath71.,width=325 ]    in figure [ fig : iqm1 ] , we have plotted the intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath64 derived from the e2 diagonal matrix elements .",
    "we clearly see that the intrinsic quadrupole moment stays approximately constant for the unperturbed bands .",
    "the intrinsic quadrupole moments of the unperturbed 4p-4h band are positive , indicating a prolate deformation of the nucleus , while the negative sign of the intrinsic quadrupole moments in the unperturbed 2p-2h band is consistent with an oblate deformation .",
    "the values of the intrinsic quadrupole moments for the unperturbed bands obtained from the ibm diagonal transition matrix elements are in good agreement with the quadrupole moment magnitudes reported by dracoulis _",
    "they calculated a magnitude of 3.4 eb for the intrinsic quadrupole moment of the unperturbed oblate band , while the ibm gives an intrinsic quadrupole moment varying between -3.4 eb and -3.7 eb . the same is valid for the unperturbed prolate band with a quadrupole moment of 6.2 eb resulting from their band mixing and a quadrupole moment varying between 5.6 eb and 6.6 eb resulting from the ibm - calculations .",
    "the mixing causes the bands to become less prolate and oblate so the intrinsic quadrupole moments for band ii and iii respectively are considerably smaller , as can be seen in figure [ fig : iqm1 ] . +   +    ) and the magnitudes of the intrinsic quadrupole moments extracted from the diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath69 ) , both for the unperturbed 2p-2h band .",
    "the lower figure shows the same comparison for the unperturbed 4p-4h band.,title=\"fig:\",width=306 ] ) and the magnitudes of the intrinsic quadrupole moments extracted from the diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath69 ) , both for the unperturbed 2p-2h band .",
    "the lower figure shows the same comparison for the unperturbed 4p-4h band.,title=\"fig:\",width=306 ]    extracting intrinsic quadrupole moments from b(e2)-values gives a similar picture as in fig .",
    "[ fig : iqm1 ] .",
    "more interesting is the comparison between the intrinsic quadrupole moments calculated from the b(e2)-values and the absolute values of the intrinsic quadrupole moments as extracted from equations and .",
    "figure [ fig : iqm2 ] depicts the comparison for the unperturbed 2p-2h ( upper part ) and the unperturbed 4p-4h band ( lower part ) .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the unperturbed 4p-4h band exhibits a rotational - like behaviour to large extent , while the unperturbed 2p-2h band is less rotational .",
    "this is in agreement with our conclusion for fig .",
    "[ fig : gsband ] .",
    "+ finally , we have also extracted the deformation parameter @xmath5 . for",
    "the unperturbed 2p-2h band @xmath5 varies between -0.11 and -0.12 , while for the unperturbed 4p-4h band @xmath5 stays between 0.19 and 0.22 .",
    "these values are smaller than the deformation parameters calculated by bender _",
    "in the present paper we have carried out a detailed analysis of the presence of various families of collective bands , in particular for @xmath0pb .",
    "we have started from an algebraic model approach ( the interacting boson model ) in order to truncate the extended shell - model space that incorporates the presence of proton particle - hole excitations across the @xmath1=82 closed shell . moreover , making use of a concept called intruder symmetry , we have been able to reduce the number of parameters in the present description .",
    "a first calculation has been carried out by fossion _ _ et al.__@xcite , accentuating the presence of three different families . here",
    ", we have defined an intermediate basis that defines three separate systems by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the 0p-0h , 2p-2h , and 4p-4h configuration spaces separately .",
    "this basis allows to understand the mixing between the unperturbed bands in a transparent way .",
    "moreover , we have used the e2-decay , starting at high spin , to define `` physical '' bands also progressing to low - spin members . here the conclusion points towards an important mixing between the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the @xmath72 , @xmath59 and @xmath48 band members , still allowing the separation into two collective band structures .",
    "a simple reanalysis of these two bands within the collective rotational model is consistent with prolate and oblate band characteristics for the unperturbed 4p-4h and 2p-2h bands respectively .",
    "extracted magnitudes of the intrinsic quadrupole and the deformation parameters are in good agreement with calculations starting from mean - field approaches . +   + it is our aim to carry out a similar analysis for the other pb - nuclei near the neutron mid - shell region and follow the mixing patterns between the two bands when moving away from the mid - shell region ( at n=104 ) and to incorporate an extensive study of electromagnetic properties ( e2- and e0-transitions ) and the study of isotopic and isomeric shifts as well .",
