    "rf energy harvesting is of particular interest as rf signals are abundant in nature through various wireless technologies and have the capacity to carry information and energy simultaneously @xcite .",
    "a capacity - energy function to evaluate the fundamental performance limits between the transport of power and information simultaneously through a single noisy line has been studied in @xcite , while the authors in @xcite have given the performance limits of mimo broadcasting systems for simultaneous information and power transfer . in @xcite and @xcite , it is assumed that the receiver is able to extract information and power from the same received signal .",
    "the authors in @xcite have , however , addressed practical circuit limitations for this assumption and studied receiver architectures which employ dynamic power sharing ( dps ) mechanisms to carry the information decoding and power transfer .",
    "cooperative relaying schemes have been widely adopted in literature to enhance the performance of a communication system in terms of diversity , coverage extension etc.@xcite .",
    "the relay might first decode the received information and then transmit , which is termed as decode and forward ( henceforth df ) relaying .",
    "alternatively , the relay might also amplify the received signal ( with a power constraint ) and then transmit , called amplify and forward ( henceforth af ) relaying .",
    "the authors in @xcite and @xcite have studied the throughput characteristics of various protocols with energy harvesting relay in af and df relaying respectively in rayleigh fading channels . further relaying protocols in diverse system models",
    "have been explored in @xcite for one - way relaying systems and in @xcite for two - way relaying .",
    "on the other hand , recent spectrum measurements show that although most of the spectrum band is allocated under license , the spectrum usage is very low @xcite , which has resulted in emerging research towards methods which facilitate spectrum sharing between users , also known as cooperative spectrum sharing .",
    "this idea of cooperative spectrum sharing has been widely pursued in literature .",
    "the authors in @xcite have proposed a scheme where a secondary user co - exists with a primary user by acting as an altruistic relay and carries its transmission along with the transmission of a licensed primary user .",
    "extension to this work with an aim to improve diversity has been studied in @xcite , wherein the secondary user is equipped with multiple antennas thus improving the coverage and performance of both primary and secondary user .",
    "the combination of cognitive spectrum sharing and opportunistic energy harvesting has been studied in @xcite , where the authors have derived maximum secondary network throughput under given outage probability constraints .",
    "outage patterns in relay assisted cognitive user which harvests energy from primary user is studied in @xcite , where an underlay@xcite cognitive network is studied .",
    "the transmission of the secondary user in @xcite is therefore limited by the peak permissible interference power with respect to the primary transmission . in this paper",
    "we consider an overlay system paradigm , where the primary user throughput is also a concern and the secondary user helps in relaying the primary signal in exchange for spectrum access .",
    "our main contributions and insights in this paper are listed as follows .",
    "* we propose time splitting and power sharing based cooperative spectrum sharing protocols in which an energy constrained secondary ( a.k.a cognitive ) user acts as a relay for the primary signal .",
    "these novel protocols address both the problems of spectrum sharing and energy harvesting , wherein the secondary user harvests energy from the primary signal , relays the primary signal , and receives spectrum access for its own transmission . * the outage probabilities under both",
    "the protocols are evaluated for both the primary and the secondary users . *",
    "the af and df relaying schemes have been separately considered while calculating the outage expressions .",
    "note that both these schemes are fundamentally different based on the nature of the relaying used , as explained in @xcite .",
    "af relaying nodes are relatively simpler to build and are preferred over df if privacy and security of the primary data is an issue . * the analytical results are verified using numerical simulations and the effect of the various system parameters on the outage have been studied .",
    "the optimum value of the splitting parameters and the node placement , which give the minimum outage at the destinations , have been evaluated . from the obtained results",
    ", it is shown that the proposed ps - css protocol , which is based on power sharing receiving at st , outperforms ts - pss protocol , which employs time - splitting based receiving over a wide range of signal to noise ratio ( snr ) values .",

    "section  [ sec:6 ] finally concludes the paper and summarizes the results .",
    "the geometric model of the scheme is shown in fig.[fig : scheme ] .",
    "our model contains a primary transmitter and receiver ( together called primary user ) and a secondary transmitter and receiver ( together called secondary user or cognitive user ) , where we study the transmission over a block time t. the total transmission is divided into phases 1 and 2 . in phase 1",
    "( solid lines in fig.[fig : scheme ] ) , the primary transmitter ( pt ) broadcasts its signal @xmath0=1)$ ] with a transmit power @xmath1 .",
    "the secondary transmitter ( st ) receives the signal , harvests energy , and processes the information from the signal . the phase 2 ( dotted lines in fig.[fig : scheme ] )",
    "is further subdivided into phase 2.a and phase 2.b . in phase 2.a",
    ", st uses the harvested energy acting as an altruistic relay and forwards the primary signal to primary receiver ( pr ) and in phase 2.b , st transmits its own signal @xmath2=1)$ ] towards secondary receiver ( sr ) .",
    "the two signals sent by st in phase 2 are split in time , to prevent any linear inter - combination of signals as in @xcite and hence avoid interference at the receivers .",
    "so , the performance constraint in these protocols is only due to channel fading and additive noise .",
    "the performance metric is taken as the outage probabilities at the receivers .",
    "specifically , we take @xmath3 and @xmath4 as the threshold rates at the primary and secondary destinations respectively and declare an outage if the achieved rates fall below these respective threshold rates , where we assume that both the transmitters always have some information to send .    for this paper , we consider all the channel links to be quasi - static block fading channels , where the channel gains are independent but need not be necessarily identically distributed ( i.i.n.d . ) .",

    ", we assume that there is no direct link between the nodes pt - pr for direct transmission ( dt ) , so the primary user completely relies on the secondary user for transmission , which is justified in the case of urban areas or nodes placed far apart .",
    "this assumption is also in line with previous research in this area such as in @xcite .",

    "we perform the analysis assuming that the nodes are equipped with single antenna , which is a reasonable assumption in small - sized sensor nodes @xcite .",
    "we further assume harvest - store - use system of energy harvesting relaying , where the energy harvested is directly and continuously used by the relaying node ( secondary transmitter in this case ) and the excess energy is stored for future use , as explained in @xcite .",

    "fig.[fig : ve1-df ] also establishes the marginal performance gain in af relaying compared to df relaying over a wide range of energy harvesting efficiency , @xmath38 .",

    "however , when the relaying st is close to the destination pr , the outage again decreases as the energy harvested , though very less , is sufficient to transmit the signal to pr , located near st .",
    "so , the ideal placement of the relay , even with a cooperative spectrum sharing mechanism , is close to pt , which agrees to the result in @xcite .",
    "another conclusion evident from the graph is that when st is near to pt than pr , af relaying gives higher throughput than df relaying and vice - versa when st is near pr , although the performance gain in either case is rather marginal .",
    "this protocol also showed similar behavior to that of the ts - css protocol in terms of the variation in the outage probability .",
    "remarkably , comparison of fig.[fig : va1-df ] and fig.[fig : va2-df ] suggests that the variation of outage with respect to the time - splitting parameter @xmath22 in both protocols follows the same pattern , for each value of m. this can be explained as follows .",
    "both ts - css and ps - css protocol employ the parameter @xmath22 as the time - sharing parameter in phase 2 , so they follow the same pattern of variation with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , this pattern is also observed in af mode , evident from fig.[fig : va2-df ] and fig.[fig : va2-af ] .",
    "on the other hand , the variation of @xmath24 in fig.[fig : vb2-df ] in df relaying does not quite follow the pattern as in fig.[fig : vb1-df ] .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath24 is around 0.7 for all values of m. it is also clear that there is also no threshold @xmath24 as all values produce a non - zero throughput .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "the time splitting in transmission phase 2 of the protocol is independent of the parameter @xmath24 , so a larger @xmath24 would not alter the transmission time at st ( refer fig.[fig : ps - css ] ) and hence has lesser dominance over the outage at both secondary and primary user .",
    "the variation of energy harvesting efficiency @xmath38 follows the same pattern in both the protocols , as more efficiency in both cases leads to lesser outage probability ( fig.[fig : ve1-df ] ) .",
    "another interesting observation is obtained by comparing fig.[fig : vb2-df ] ( df ) with fig.[fig : vb2-af ] ( af ) .",
    "although the variation is identically different from their ts - css counterparts , the outage probability of the secondary user in amplify forward mode is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath24 , suggesting that greater the value of @xmath24 chosen at st , better will be the performance of the secondary user .",
    "this is because if @xmath24 is high , st will get greater transmit power and hence better performance .",
    "this is compared with decode forward relaying , where increasing @xmath24 would in turn reduce the decoding capabilities at st , and if st has failed to decode the signal in phase 1 , it does not transmit its own signal too in phase 2 , which is not the case with af relaying .",
    "finally , both the relaying schemes are compared with each other over a wide range of snrs and the plot is shown in fig.[fig : intercomp ] for m=1 which corresponds to rayleigh fading channel .",
    "clearly , the ps - css relaying scheme outperforms the ts - css relaying scheme over a wide range of snrs for both the primary and secondary users .",
    "so we conclude that the power sharing based receiving has better throughput compared to time splitting receiving in a rayleigh fading channel .    ,",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "with an intention of addressing both the issues of energy constraint and spectrum efficiency in wireless networks , we propose two protocols in this paper to carry transmission in a spectrum sharing scenario between a primary user and an energy harvesting secondary user and analyze outage probabilities of these protocols .",
    "the outage expressions are plotted with respect to system parameters , and it is found out that power sharing based relaying is better than time splitting based relaying for cooperative spectrum sharing protocols over a wide range of snrs at optimum values of @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is also found that af relaying scheme is better than df relaying for most cases except when st is very near to pr , in which case the throughput of df relaying has slightly better throughput .",
    "the explained protocols enables efficient usage of the spectrum without adversely effecting the performance of the primary user and promises longer lifetime of the sensor nodes through energy harvesting .",
    "an outage is declared for the primary user if any of the links pt - st or st - pr fail to achieve the threshold rate required to decode the signal(@xmath3 ) . for the secondary user ,",
    "outage is dependent on the links pt - st and st - pr , and the decoding rate at sr has to meet the threshold @xmath4 .                                                  which can be written as @xmath116 consider the expression @xmath117 inside the integral .",
    "let @xmath118 . from , if the factor @xmath119 , the lhs of the expression is negative and rhs is positive , so that @xmath120(-ve@xmath121+ve)=1 .",
    "else , if @xmath122 , this quantity can be written as @xmath123 .",
    "so can be written as @xmath124 using the knowledge of gamma random variables reduces to      the substitution @xmath125 gives us the desired result for @xmath55 as an integration in .",
    "due to higher order terms inside the inner gamma function , the integration can not be further simplified and hence is solved off line numerically in the simulation results .",
