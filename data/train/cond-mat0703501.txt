    "quantum dots have often been termed artificial atoms and molecules.@xcite indeed , their tunability via electrical gates has permitted one to reach into a regime where only a single electron sits in each dot . a double dot then becomes the analogue of a hydrogen molecule .",
    "the heisenberg exchange coupling in such a system can be manipulated by appropriately chosen electrical pulse sequences , up to a point which has not yet been achieved for its real counterpart.@xcite recently , it has been demonstrated that this technique allows the realization of the fundamental one- and two - qubit quantum gates  @xcite in such a system.@xcite    naturally , the question arises whether the successful schemes and techniques of an electrical control of spins in quantum dots can be transfered back to electron spins in single molecules . in view of the recent experimental progress in the field of molecular electronics , which demonstrates that magnetic transitions in atomic chains  @xcite and single molecules  @xcite can be resolved in transport measurements , such a goal should in principle be achievable . in particular , the field of molecular magnetism  @xcite has provided a plethora of systems of almost arbitrary magnetic functionality.@xcite very recently , phase - coherence times of up to @xmath5 have been reported for such molecular nanomagnets after deuteration.@xcite yet , a suitable system for an electrical control of molecular qubits has still been missing . it is this electrical control which is crucial for scalability and which distinguishes this proposal from earlier ones also based on molecular magnets .",
    "@xcite    here we propose an experimental setup which permits the electrical switching of the exchange interactions between two electron spins .",
    "the system we choose for illustrating our proposal is [ pmo@xmath0o@xmath1(vo)@xmath2@xmath3 ,  @xcite a polyoxometalate  @xcite which consists of a central mixed - valence core based on the [ pmo@xmath0o@xmath1 ] keggin  @xcite unit , able to act as an electron reservoir accommodating a variable number of delocalized electrons hopping over the mo centers , capped by two vanadyl groups containing two localized spins ( cf .",
    "[ fig : model ] )    \\(a ) ( b )    the spins on these two ( vo)@xmath7 units are weakly magnetically coupled via the delocalized electrons of the central core .",
    "we shall show how this magnetic coupling can be switched in an all - electrical way and how this can be used for the implementation of a fundamental two - qubit gate ( providing entanglement ) , the so - called square - root - of - swap @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , we will detail how to use a variation of this procedure for the readout of the final state of the two qubits .",
    "for the description of the low - energy states of the polyoxometalate , two cases have to be distinguished : for an _ even _ number of electrons on the mixed - valence keggin core , their spins pair antiferromagnetically to form a total spin  @xmath9 state",
    ". then the system can be modelled by the two spins @xmath10 on the vanadyl groups weakly coupled via an indirect exchange mechanism mediated by the core electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "if the number of core electrons is _ odd _ , an unpaired spin @xmath10 on the core remains and one obtains a set of three coupled spins @xmath10 . restricting ourselves to two charge states differing by one electron , we can choose the electron number of the even state as reference and write the hamiltonian in the form @xmath11 here , the first term describes the indirect - exchange coupling between the left and right spins @xmath12 and @xmath13 with a coupling constant  @xmath14 which depends on the number of electrons @xmath15measured with respect to the reference number  on the central core of the molecule . in the case of an electron being localized on the core , its spin  @xmath16 couples to the left and right spins with coupling constant  @xmath17 . here ,",
    "the operators @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) destroy ( create ) and electron on the central core and @xmath20 is the vector of the three pauli matrices .",
    "the two last terms contain the orbital energy  @xmath21 of the electron on the central core , which can be shifted due to a gate potential  @xmath22 , and the molecule s charging energy  @xmath23 , respectively . the latter is assumed to be the largest energy scale of the problem .",
    "we consider a situation where the central core of the molecule is tunnel - coupled to one or more metallic leads  @xmath24 permitting electrons to flow on and off the molecule with tunnelling rates @xmath25 . in the stm setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , two leads , the tip and the metallic surface , are present .",
    "we assume that an insulating layer  which still allows electrons to tunnel through  between the surface and the molecule leads to a molecule - surface coupling which is much smaller than the typical energy scale  @xmath17 of the molecular hamiltonian  .",
    "an applied bias voltage  @xmath26 then leads to a shift of the molecular levels which to a very good approximation is described by the linear relation @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite note that in a more sophisticated three - terminal setup , the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath29 can be controlled independently .",
    "the @xmath30 operation is defined by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . for electrically confined quantum dots",
    ", it can be physically implemented by an appropriately chosen gate - voltage pulse which turns on the heisenberg exchange coupling between the qubits for a specific time ( see below).@xcite in a molecular system , however , the exchange constants are fixed by the chemical structure and can not be directly changed .",
    "thus , a more sophisticated quantum - gate scheme has to be employed .",
    "we propose to indirectly manipulate the coupling between the two qubits by changing the occupation  @xmath15 of the central core in the molecule described above .",
    "this change in @xmath15 can be induced by changing the gate voltage @xmath22 , such that different charge sectors of the molecule become stable ( cf .",
    "[ fig : gating_sequence ] ) .",
    "chemically this amounts to a change in the redox potential of the molecule .",
    "we will first discuss the basic idea of the quantum - gate scheme , thereby assuming that the electron number  @xmath15 can be changed in a deterministic , externally controllable way .",
    "later on , this assumption will be relaxed and the full tunnelling dynamics due to the change in @xmath22 will be included .     operation and exchange coupling constants during the corresponding gate phase . the gate is turned on for a time @xmath33    initially , one adjusts the gate voltage  @xmath22 in such a way that the stable configuration is given by an even number of electrons on the central core ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we assume that the exchange coupling @xmath35 between the spins @xmath12 and @xmath13 will then be very small and can be disregarded for times much smaller than @xmath36 ( see also below ) .",
    "the quantum - gate operation begins by changing the gate voltage such that the @xmath37 charge sector becomes stable .",
    "then , on a time - scale of the inverse tunnelling rate , an electron enters the central core .",
    "after this has happened , the dynamics of the three - qubit system is governed by the hamiltonian   in the @xmath38 subspace .",
    "the spin - dependent part of this hamiltonian becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total spin of the system and @xmath41 . before considering the time - evolution due to this hamiltonian",
    ", we conclude our discussion of the gate cycle : after a specific time  @xmath42 , one switches back to the initial gate voltage and the excess electron tunnels off the central core again .",
    "after this has happened , the two outer spins are , up to times much smaller than @xmath36 , decoupled again .    the only non - trivial dynamics is induced by the hamiltonian  .",
    "the first term contains an effective exchange coupling between the two spins .",
    "up to an irrelevant phase factor , its corresponding time - evolution yields the @xmath30 gate if the gate time @xmath42 fulfils  @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 being an arbitrary integer .",
    "the second term in equation   depends on the total spin of the three - spin-@xmath10 system .",
    "while this quantity is unknown , we can eliminate its influence on the gate behavior if we restrict ourselves to stroboscopic gate times @xmath42 for which the contribution @xmath45 $ ] to the time - evolution operator is trivial .",
    "evaluating the effect of the operator @xmath46 in the eigenbasis ( see also equation   below ) , this is the case for gate times given by @xmath47 with the arbitrary integer @xmath48 .",
    "it is important to note that relation   is independent of the spin direction of the additional electron . equating conditions   and , we obtain the following relation between @xmath49 and @xmath17 : @xmath50",
    "in the preceding discussion we have assumed that the tunnelling process of the electron is highly controlled , i.e. , that we are able to instantaneously switch between the @xmath51 and @xmath38 states . in reality , tunnelling is a probabilistic event occurring on a mean time scale of the order of the inverse tunnelling rate . in order to investigate to",
    "what extent this stochasticity affects our analytical findings , we compare them with numerical results obtained from a simulation of the incoherent quantum dynamics using the average gate fidelity  @xmath52 as figure of merit for the gate process ( see app .",
    "[ sec : br ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelity ] , we show this quantity as a function of the gate time and the ratio @xmath53 for the case of a ferromagnetic coupling @xmath54 ( the antiferromagnetic case behaves very similarly ) .     as a function of the gate time @xmath42 and the ratio @xmath53 for a ferromagnetic @xmath54 .",
    "the conditions   and are indicated by solid lines .",
    "the parameters are : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ( measured from the charge - degeneracy point ) . ]",
    "we focus on the strong - coupling regime @xmath58 , where tunnelling proceeds rapidly compared to the internal coherent dynamics .",
    "as expected from our analytical considerations , the average gate fidelity assumes maxima whenever both conditions   and are fulfilled .",
    "we found the gate error @xmath59 to decrease with increasing tunnelling rate @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath61 , for instance , we obtain a fidelity @xmath62 at the maximum indicated by the circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelity ] .",
    "we now show that in a molecular system described by the hamiltonian  , it is possible to readout the quantum number @xmath63 of the two outer spins by measuring the sequential tunnelling current through the central dot .",
    "the current can be calculated using the bloch - redfield equation approach ( see app .  [",
    "sec : br ] ) . for a qualitative understanding",
    "it is sufficient to consider the allowed transitions , i.e. , non - zero matrix elements  @xmath64 , between the eigenstates of the two different charge sectors @xmath51 and @xmath38 .",
    "the former are the eigenstates @xmath65 of the total spin @xmath66 of the two outer spins .",
    "the hamiltonian   of the molecule with an additional electron can be readily diagonalized by rewriting it up to an irrelevant constant as @xmath67 thus , in the basis of the simultaneous eigenstates @xmath68 of @xmath46 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the hamiltonian in the @xmath38 subsector is already diagonal . for the matrix elements",
    "@xmath71 , we then obtain the selection rules @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , we note that the quantum number @xmath63 stays invariant under a complete sequential - tunnelling cycle .",
    "since furthermore the energy differences determining the tunnelling rates and thus the current depend on the quantum number @xmath63 , we find that the ( quasi-)stationary value of the current can be strongly dependent on the initial preparation of @xmath63 .    this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : readout ] , where the conductance peaks as a function of gate and bias voltage are shown schematically for two different initial values of @xmath63 .",
    "( dashed line ) and @xmath75 ( solid line ) . ]    from the figure we see that by starting initially at zero bias  @xmath76 in the @xmath51 state , we first reach , upon increasing  @xmath29 , the allowed ground - state transition and thus the onset of the sequential tunnelling current for the triplet @xmath75 . on the other hand , for a singlet preparation  @xmath77 , sequential tunnelling will only be possible at a voltage which is higher by @xmath78 . at low enough tunnelling rate and temperature ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath79 , it is possible to distinguish these two cases and hence to measure the quantum number @xmath63 .",
    "as discussed before , for an independent control of the two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig : readout ] , a three - terminal geometry is required . in the stm setup discussed here , one will only move along a line in fig .",
    "[ fig : readout ] , which , however , is sufficient for the readout scheme , if the molecule is in the @xmath34 charge sector at @xmath76 .",
    "note that for an initial superposition with singlet and triplet contributions , the readout process just described represents a projective measurement .",
    "the first electron attempting to tunnel determines the final outcome , i.e. , the long - time current .",
    "the average over many repeated measurements is described by the solution of the master equation  .",
    "we remark that the singlet - triplet readout process requires a substantially smaller tunnel coupling than the one for the exchange - controlled quantum - gate operation .",
    "there are several ways how to achieve this : obviously , one could increase the molecule - tip distance which leads to an exponentially strong change in the tunnelling rate .",
    "still , doing so on a very short time - scale might be technically challenging .",
    "another possibility would be to use that the tunnel barrier  and , thus , in turn the coupling strength  depends on both the gate- and the bias - voltage .",
    "@xcite depending on the details of the contact , this might be enough to achieve the required change in the tunnel coupling .",
    "alternatively , one could transfer the readout scheme to the so - called cotunnelling regime ,  @xcite where transport proceeds via virtual tunnelling on and off the molecule . then",
    ", the onset of the inelastic cotunnelling current is solely temperature - smeared , even in the presence of a strong molecule - lead coupling .",
    "for measuring @xmath63 one would then need to apply a magnetic field , which will lead to a splitting of the triplet state @xmath75 only .",
    "thus , one will find only for this state an inelastic cotunnelling step in the conductance - voltage characteristics at the bias voltage corresponding to the zeeman energy .",
    "while the preceding discussion applies to any system described by a hamiltonian of the form  , we now return to the specific case of the molecule [ pmo@xmath0o@xmath1(vo)@xmath2@xmath80 .",
    "a high redox flexibility is a characteristical feature of polyoxometalates , where cyclic voltammetry experiments show one- or two - electron reversible redox peaks , depending on the system and on the conditions . in particular , four compounds based on the xmo@xmath0o@xmath1 ( x = si , ge , p ) keggin structure ( either alone or vanadyl - bicapped )",
    "have been recently found to show reversible two - electron electrochemical processes .",

    "we note that regardless of the orientation of the molecule , the change in charge state is firmly expected to affect the central mo@xmath0o@xmath1 core and not the vanadyl groups , so we think orientation will only have an additional effect on ( ii ) . as an insulating thin layer separates the molecule from the metallic substrate",
    ", the alteration in the electronic structure of the polyoxometalate is expected to be minimal ( details are discussed in the app .  [",
    "sec : par ] ) . the main effect on the low - energy physics will be to introduce an asymmetry in the couplings between the left and right vanadyl groups and the keggin structure , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively . in table  i",

    "furthermore , we have verified that an asymmetry of up to @xmath94 does still allow one to achieve a fidelity of @xmath95 in the regime @xmath96 ( for details see app .",
    "[ sec : quant ] ) .",
    "concerning ( iii ) , cations needed to compensate the negative charge of the polyoxometalate polyanions , as well as solvent molecules , may be still present when the cluster is deposited .",
    "this feature may be a potentially important addition on ( ii ) which could be minimized using an electrospray system to choose the mass / charge ratio corresponding to an isolated polyoxoanion .",
    "such techniques have succesfully been applied to polyoxometalates and the peaks of the isolated anions have been detected.@xcite finally ( iv ) , the full diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian also results in a set of excited states with energies @xmath97 above those states described by the hamiltonian  : we also include these data in table  i.    having these points in mind , we see that different charge states are usable .",
    "if we consider for instance @xmath98 and @xmath99 , one would need molecule - lead coupling rates @xmath100 in the range of around @xmath101 and @xmath102 , for the gate and readout process , respectively .",
    "for the gate procedure , voltage pulses of a precision on the order of a few @xmath103 are required , which is not far from what can be achieved with present technology .",
    "in fact , if @xmath104 and @xmath105 are found to be chemically stable in the experimental environment , their parameters will be even more suitable for our purposes by allowing @xmath106 times longer pulse times and yielding @xmath107 as well as @xmath108 .",
    "the present scheme defines a class of molecular systems : those where two localized spins are coupled to a redox - active unit . the physically relevant figures of merit are included in table  [ par ] ; the chemical desiderata are stability , facility of deposition on surfaces , and possibility of controlled oligomerization .",
    "indeed , scalability of the present scheme requires covalent bonding and directed self - assembly of these logical building blocks .",
    "molecules of this class can be found in several chemical families , besides bicapped polyoxometalates .",
    "tetrathiofulvalene derivatives , polypyrrol , porphyrines / phthalocyanines , fullerene and single - wall nanotubes are a few among a plethora of organic systems which can reversibly lose or gain one electron , can be substituted with radical groups , and have a rich and well - controlled chemistry .",
    "for example , theoretical calculations on phthalocyanines point to the possibility of the chemical tailoring of these molecules to enable exchange couplings in the range required for the gate scheme described here  @xcite .",
    "while for an initial experimental realization with a single molecule , an stm contacting scheme as discussed in the present article enables the best control and is clearly favorable , a scalable method for a molecular monolayer could be based , e.g. , on a crossbar architecture which already with current technology reaches very high densities.@xcite    in conclusion , we have proposed an experimental setup for single - molecule all - electric two - qubit gate and readout which is within reach of current technology .",
    "we have exemplified our scheme using a mixed - valence polyoxometalate , for which the model parameters have been calculated using an _ ab initio _ approach .",
    "the general principles behind our proposal also apply to different classes of molecular systems .",
