    "the use of radioactive nuclear beams produced by fragmentation in high - energy heavy - ion reactions lead to the discovery of halo nuclei , such as @xmath0li , about 20 years ago @xcite . nowadays",

    "successive use of this technique has yielded nuclear size data over a wide range of isotopes .",
    "other techniques , e.g. isotope - shift measurements , have allowed to extract the charge size .",
    "the growth of a neutron skin with the neutron number in several isotopes have been deduced from nuclear- and charge - size data @xcite .",
    "the charge ( nucleon ) density distribution can also be determined by electron ( hadron ) scattering experiments . among hadron scattering ,",
    "proton elastic scattering at intermediate energies is a good tool to probe the nucleon density distributions , due to its larger mean - free path in the nuclear medium .",
    "but , undoubtedly , it is the electron scattering off nuclei that provides the most direct information about charge distribution , which is closely related to the spatial distribution of protons @xcite .",
    "a technical proposal for an electron - heavy - ion collider has been incorporated in the gsi / germany physics program @xcite . a similar program exists for the riken / japan facility using self - confining radioactive ion targets ( scrits ) @xcite . in both cases the main purpose is to study the structure of nuclei far from the stability line .",
    "the advantages of using electrons in the investigation of the nuclear structure are mainly related to the fact that the electron - nucleus interaction is relatively weak .",
    "for this reason multiple scattering effects are usually small and the scattering process is described in terms of perturbation theory . since the reaction mechanism in perturbation theory is well under control the connection between the cross section and quantities such as charge distributions , transition densities , response functions etc .",
    ", is well understood @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the shape of the density distribution includes detailed information on the internal nuclear structure . in the independent particle shell model",
    "the density distribution is the squared sum of the single - particle wave functions .",
    "no measurement of either nucleon distribution or the charge distribution for short - lived radioactive nuclei has been made so far .    under the impulse approximation , or plane wave born approximation , the charge form factor can be determined from the differential cross section of elastic electron scattering . since the charge distribution , @xmath3 ,",
    "is obtained from the charge form factor by a fourier transformation , one can experimentally determine @xmath3 by differential cross - section measurements covering a wide range of momentum transfer @xmath4 .",

    "the difference between the proton and neutron distributions can be obtained in the framework of hartree - fock ( hf ) method ( see for example @xcite ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method ( see for example @xcite ) . as a rule of thumb , a theoretical calculation of the nuclear density",
    "is considered good when it reproduces the data on elastic electron scattering . but some details of the theoretical densities might not be accessible in the experiments , due to poor resolution or limited experimental reach of the momentum transfer @xmath4 .",
    "recent works have also looked at electron scattering from halo nuclei , see e.g. refs . @xcite .    in this work",
    "i study the general features of elastic electron scattering off unstable nuclei . here",
    "i focus on using the general features of what is theoretically known about skins and halos to look for their respective signatures in the data .",
    "only a few specific and representative nuclear density cases are used .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a general introduction of elastic electron scattering in section 2 ,",
    "i show in section 3 how the telltales of neutron and proton skins and halos become visible in the differential cross sections for elastic electron scattering .",
    "section 4 presents a study of the inverse scattering problem , which poses a challenge for extracting the charge density profiles from the experimental data .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "in the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) the relation between the charge density and the cross section is given by@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mott cross section , the term in the denominator is a recoil correction , @xmath11 is the electron total energy , @xmath12 is the mass of the nucleus and @xmath13  is the scattering angle .    the charge form factor @xmath14 for a spherical mass distribution is given by@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the momentum transfer , @xmath17 is the electron momentum , and @xmath18 .",
    "the low momentum expansion of eq .",
    "[ form ] yields the leading terms @xmath19 thus , a measurement at low momentum transfer yields a direct assessment of the mean square radius of the charge distribution , @xmath20 .",
    "however , as more details of the charge distribution is probed more terms of this series are needed and , for a precise description of it , the form factor dependence for large momenta @xmath4 is needed .    a theoretical calculation of the charge density entering eq . [ form ] can be obtained in many ways .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22  denote the point distributions of the protons and the neutrons , respectively , as calculated , e.g. from single - particle wavefunctions obtained from an average one - body potential well , the latter in general being different for protons and neutrons . if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the spatial charge distributions of the proton and the neutron in the non - relativistic limit , the charge distribution of the nucleus is given by@xmath25    the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ rhoch ] plays an important role in the interpretation of the charge distribution of some nuclear isotopes .",
    "for example , the half - density charge radius increases 2% from @xmath26ca to @xmath27ca , whereas the surface thickness decreases by 10% with the result that there is more charge in the surface region of @xmath26ca than of @xmath27ca @xcite .",
    "this also implies that the rms charge radius of @xmath27ca is slightly smaller than that of @xmath26ca .",
    "the reason for this anomaly is that the added @xmath28 neutrons contribute negatively to the charge distribution in the surface and more than compensate for the increase in the rms radius of the proton distribution .    for the proton the charge density @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ rhoch ] is taken as an exponential function , corresponding to a form factor @xmath30 ( see appendix a ) . for the neutron",
    "a good parametrization is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the neutron magnetic dipole moment and @xmath33 .",
    "we will use @xmath34 @xmath35 ( corresponding to a proton rms radius of 0.87 fm ) and @xmath36 , which galster et al . @xcite",
    "have shown to reproduce electron - nucleon scattering data .",
    "[ pwba]-[rhoch ] are based on the first born approximation .",
    "they give good results for light nuclei ( e.g. @xmath37c ) and high - energy electrons .",
    "for large-@xmath38 nuclei the agreement with experiment is only of a qualitative nature .",
    "the effects of distortion of the electron waves have been studied by many authors ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . more important than the change in the normalization of the cross section is the displacement of the minima .",
    "it is well known that a simple modification can be included in the pwba equation reproducing the shift of the minima to lower @xmath4 s .",
    "one replaces the momentum transfer @xmath4 in the form factor of eq .",
    "[ pwba ] with the effective momentum transfer @xmath39 , where @xmath11 is the electron energy and @xmath40 fm .",
    "this is because a measurement at momentum transfer @xmath4 probes in fact @xmath41 at @xmath42 due to the attraction the electrons feel by the positive charge of the nucleus .",
    "this expression for @xmath43 assumes a homogeneous distribution of charge within a sphere of radius @xmath44 .",
    "a realistic description of elastic electron scattering cross sections requires full solution of the dirac equation .",
    "the dirac equation for elastic scattering from a charge distribution can be found in standard textbooks , e.g. @xcite .",
    "numerous dwba codes based on dirac distorted waves have been developed and are public . since the inclusion of coulomb distortion is straight - forward , we will concentrate on the information which can be extracted from elastic electron scattering , which is encoded in the form - factor of eq .",
    "[ form ] . later we will study the problem of extracting the full nuclear density from the form factor . for simplicity , we will also neglect the effect of the charge distribution of the neutron itself .",
    "this effect is particularly important for large @xmath4-transfers . for heavy nuclei it can change @xmath45  by 10 - 20% in the q - range of 1.5 - 2 fm@xmath7",

    "this shows that the sharp sphere model is too simple and that in this model the central densities for proton and neutrons have to differ if eq .",
    "[ deltad ] is to remain valid .    on the experimental front ,",

    "a negative neutron skin obviously means an excess of protons at the surface . for unstable nuclei",
    "no study as the one leading to eq .",

    "nucleon knockout reactions with secondary unstable nuclear beams , and other techniques , have been used to determine the interaction radii of neutron rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "these radii are thought to represent the extension of the neutron distribution .",
    "but very little is known about the charge distribution in neutron - rich nuclei .    for heavy nuclei",
    "the charge and neutron distributions can be described by a fermi distribution .",
    "the diffuseness is usually much smaller than the half - density radius , @xmath91 . the neutron skin is then given by @xmath92 .",

    "of course , sudden changes of the neutron skin with @xmath100  might happen due to shell closures , pairing , and other microscopic effects .    to be more specific ,",

    "@xmath120 fm@xmath7 , meaning that the experimental resolution on the value of @xmath112 has to be within 1% if @xmath117 fm is a required precision .",
    "the situation improves for heavier nuclei , as becomes evident from figure [ q1min1 ] .",
    "the neutron skin dependence is also seen in the height of the second bump , after the first minimum .",

    "@xmath125 is closely given by the fourier transform of an yukawa function , its value at @xmath126 is of the order of @xmath127 and its variation around @xmath128 is weak , @xmath129 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "thus , the dependence of the height of the second maximum upon the neutron skin is a less appropriate tool than the location of the first minimum . of course",
    ", the ultimate test of a given theoretical model will be a good reproduction of the measured data , below and beyond the first minimum .      for light halo nuclei composed of a core nucleus and an extended distribution of halo nucleons ,",

    "taking @xmath0li as an example , the following set of parameters can be used @xmath131 @xmath132 fm and @xmath133 fm .",
    "this means that @xmath134 nucleons are in the halo , the size of the core is roughly 2 fm , and the size of the halo is 6.5 fm .",
    "although only few nucleons are in the halo they change dramatically the shape of the form factor , as shown in figure [ form3 ] .",
    "the dashed - dotted curve is the squared charge form factor .",
    "the dotted curve applies for the matter density of the halo neutrons .",
    "when the core ( dashed curve ) and halo nucleon distributions are combined the squared form factor for the total matter distribution ( solid curve ) clearly displays the halo signature .",
    "thus , even when the individual contribution of the halo nucleons is small and barely visible in a linear plot of the matter distribution , it is very important for the form factor of the total matter distribution .",
    "it is responsible for the narrow peak which develops at low momentum transfers .",
    "this signature of the halo was indeed the motivation for the early experiments with radioactive beams .",
    "the narrow peak was observed in momentum distributions following knockout reactions @xcite .",
    "elastic electron scattering will not be sensitive to the narrow peak of @xmath135 ( matter distribution form factor ) at small momentum @xmath4 , but to the the charge distribution form factor , @xmath136 which in the case of @xmath0li will be similar to the dashed - dotted curve in figure [ form3 ] .",
    "the determination of this form factor will tell us if the core has been appreciably modified due to the presence of the halo nucleons .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that many of what we call core nuclei are also short - lived and very little is known about their charge distribution .    in order to explain the spin , parities , separation energies and size of exotic nuclei",

    "@xmath206 is the electron momentum , @xmath4 is the momentum transfer , and @xmath207 is the reduced mass , where it is assumed that the nucleus is composed of two clusters .",
    "we now integrate this equation over the excitation energy @xmath200 , and obtain @xmath208 this equation is valid for large electron energies , so that @xmath209 , and for small scattering angles , for which the approximation @xmath210 can be used .",
    "in fact , the minimum momentum transfer for an excitation energy @xmath211 is given by @xmath212 .",
    "thus , the inelastic cross section tends to a maximum value at very small scattering angles ( in contrast , the elastic scattering cross section increases indefinitely at small angles ) .",

    "however , whereas the theoretical @xmath225 can contain useful information about the central part of the density ( e.g. bubble - like nuclei , with a depressed central density ) , an excellent fit to the available experimental data does not necessarily mean that the data is sensitive to those details .",
    "the obvious reason is that short distances are probed by larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "experimental data from electron - ion colliders will suffer from limited accuracy at large values of @xmath4 , possibly beyond @xmath226 fm@xmath7 .",
    "thus it is useful to identify what are the conditions for reproducing the nuclear density within a theory independent fit .    in order to obtain",

    "[ dens ] has to be truncated and this produces an error in the determination of the charge density distribution .",
    "another problem is that , as shown by eq .",
    "[ densinv ] , the solution of the inverse scattering problem requires an accurate determination of the cross section up to large momentum transfers .",
    "electron scattering experiments in electron - ion colliders will be performed within a limited range of @xmath4 and this will produce an uncertainty in the determination of the charge density distribution . as we have discussed in previous sections , the measurements have to encompass the first few minima of the cross section for heavy nuclei in order that the density profile can be mapped .",
    "we consider two bases that have been found useful @xcite in the analysis of electron or proton scattering data .",
    "the present discussion is limited to spherical nuclei , but generalizations to deformed nuclei can be done .",
    "the fourier - bessel ( fb ) expansion ( i.e. with @xmath231 taken as spherical bessel functions ) is useful because of the orthogonality relation between spherical bessel functions@xmath232   ^{2}\\delta_{nm},\\label{orthob}%\\ ] ] where the @xmath233 are defined such as@xmath234 the fb basis implies that the charge density @xmath3 should be zero for values of @xmath174 larger than @xmath235 .",

    "not all @xmath84 s are needed .",
    "since the integral of the density , or @xmath242 , is fixed to the charge number there is one less degree of freedom .",
    "also , densities tend to zero at large @xmath174 .",
    "thus another condition can be used , e.g. that the derivative of the density is zero at @xmath235 .",
    "thus , when we talk about @xmath243 expansion coefficients one means in fact that only @xmath244 coefficients need to be used in eq .",
    "[ formfb ] .  for experiments performed up to @xmath245 the number of expansion coefficients needed for the fit",
    "is determined by @xmath246 .",
    "a disadvantage of the fb expansion is that a relatively large number of terms is often needed to accurately represent a typical confined density , e.g. for light nuclei .",
    "one can use other expansion functions which are invoke less number of expansion parameters , e.g. the laguerre - gauss ( lg ) expansion , @xmath247 where @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 is the generalized laguerre polynomial .",
    "another possibility is to use an expansion on hermite ( h ) polynomials . in both cases ,",
    "the number of terms needed to provide a reasonable approximation to the density can be minimized by choosing @xmath2 in accordance with the natural radial scale . for light nuclei @xmath251 fm can be chosen , consistent with the parametrization of their densities .",
    "then the magnitude of @xmath84 decreases rapidly with @xmath243 , but the quality of the fit and the shape of the density are actually independent of @xmath2 over a wide range .",
    "as shown by application to a few cases , the main information on skin and halo sizes can be obtained using the fb expansion without problems .",
    "figure [ fb1 ] shows the charge form factor squared for a fermi function distribution with half - density radius @xmath252 fm and diffuseness @xmath253 fm ( solid line ) .",

    "[ formfb ] , up to @xmath254 .",
    "the dashed curve uses up to @xmath255 .",
    "one clearly sees that the latter improves the fit to the form factor up to the third minimum by increasing @xmath254 to @xmath255 .",
    "we use @xmath256 fm , so that adding the @xmath255 term improves the fit of the distribution including the peak at @xmath257 fm@xmath7 , as seen in the figure .    for real data ,",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath84 are obtained by minimizing@xmath258 where @xmath259 is the fitted value of the cross section ( form factor ) with a set of coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath260 are the experimental data at momentum @xmath261 with uncertainty @xmath262 .",
    "to check the limitations of this procedure , we generate a set of pseudodata for @xmath1b .",
    "the calculated charge form factor of figures [ formb81 ] and [ compf ] is used to generate 40 data points equally spaced by @xmath263 fm@xmath7 .",

    "the best fit , with @xmath267 fm , is obtained with @xmath268 expansion coefficients . increasing the number of coefficients",
    "does not improve the quality of the fit , as is shown in figure [ fbb8 ] for @xmath269 .",
    "it only produces more oscillations of the density .",
    "the reason is that terms with larger @xmath243 s are only needed to reproduce the data at larger values of momentum transfer , as shown in fig .",
    "the fit to the data for @xmath270 is not affected but the presence of these new terms introduces oscillations in the charge distribution . a possible fix to this problem",
    "is to include pseudodata in addition to experimental data .",
    "this method is well known in the literature @xcite .",
    "the pseudodata are used to enforce constraints and to estimate the incompleteness error associated with the limitation of experimental data to a finite range of momentum transfer .",
    "in this work i have studied the electron scattering off light unstable nuclei .",
    "this work is complementary to previous works in this area ( see e.g. ref .",
    "particular attention was given to the effect of the neutron ( proton ) skin on the scattering form factors .",
    "it was shown that the position of the first minimum is arguably the best signature to look for noticeable changes in the charge radius size .",
    "the evidence of a proton halo is not so clear as in the case of other probes .",
    "for example , it is well known that @xmath198be fragments arising from the proton knockout of @xmath1b projectiles display a distinctively narrow momentum distribution characteristic of a long tail of the valence proton in @xmath1b @xcite .",
    "this feature is a consequence of the peripheral character of the knockout process , which is ideal to probe the tail of the bound states .",
    "nonetheless , due to the coulomb barrier the bulk of the charge in the nucleus is confined close to its center .",
    "electron scattering is sensitive to this bulk charge and therefore does not display such a strong halo signature .",
    "the minimum information obtained with electron scattering in electron - ion colliders will be the rms charge radius , @xmath271 .",
    "this information per se  is very valuable .",
    "it is sensitive to the skin size in a heavy nucleus .",
    "but it also depends on the accuracy with which this quantity can be measured . as we have shown in the previous sections",
    ", it will be necessary to go beyond the first minimum to extract information about the central value of the charge density .",
    "accurate measurements at large momentum transfers are crucial if one wants to describe the matter distribution with confidence and have a good comparison with predictions of different theoretical models .",
    "i have shown with a few basic examples using the fourier - bessel expansion method that , whereas the matter distribution within the halo is well probed by measurements at small momentum transfers , the details of the central distribution requires measurements at large @xmath4 s where inelastic processes may play an important role .",
