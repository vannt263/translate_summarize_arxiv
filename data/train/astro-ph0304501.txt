    "during the last decade of the past century there has been a vivid discussion about the opacity of spiral galaxies .",
    "this discussion was initiated by disney , davies & phillipps  ( 1989 ) and valentijn  ( 1990 ) , who countered the conventional view that spiral galaxies are optically thin over their entire optical discs ( holmberg  1958 ; de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs & corwin  1976 ; sandage & tammann  1981 ) .",
    "this issue has not yet been settled , although an overall consensus seems to be emerging that spiral galaxies are , in general , at least moderately optically thick within their optical disc , i.e.  that they have central face - on optical depth of at least unity .",
    "we will not repeat a detailed overview of the different points of view and the large variety of observational tests , and refer to davies & burstein  ( 1995 ) , xilouris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , kuchinski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and calzetti  ( 2001 ) for excellent reviews .",
    "we just wish to point out an important observational constraint which , in our opinion , is not always given enough attention : the far - infrared ( fir ) emission of spiral galaxies .",
    "this emission originates from the absorption of starlight by dust grains , which is thermally re - emitted at longer wavelengths .",
    "the most recent results show that about 30 per cent of the bolometric luminosity of late - type galaxies is fir emission by interstellar dust ( popescu & tuffs 2002 ) .",
    "notice that this figure refers to normal quiescent spiral galaxies ; special classes of galaxies such as starburst galaxies emit even higher fractions of their energy at fir wavelengths .",
    "these facts demonstrate quite convincingly that interstellar dust forms an important constituent of spiral galaxies .",
    "the physical processes of absorption and scattering by dust grains should hence be taken into account when interpreting and modelling the observed optical properties of galaxies .",
    "we would like to stress that _ all _ optical observables will to some extent be affected by dust , including the observed kinematics .",
    "indeed , when interstellar dust grains absorb or scatter photons , the kinematical information contained within these photons , in the form of the doppler shift , will also be absorbed or scattered .",
    "it is important to realize that most of the kinematical data of galaxies are optical measurements .",
    "firstly , stellar kinematics are always measured from optical absorption lines . in principle , the attenuation effects of interstellar dust could be minimized by using the sensitive @xmath0co absorption feature at 2.29  @xmath1 m ( gaffney , lester & doppmann 1995 ) . measuring stellar kinematics at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths is , however , observationally extremely difficult due to the high sky surface brightness .",
    "secondly , the vast majority of spatially resolved rotation curves of spiral galaxies have been measured using optical emission lines ( usually the h@xmath2 line ) .",
    "they can also be measured using the hi or co lines , where dust extinction is not an issue . however , these methods are observationally much more expensive than the more straightforward h@xmath2 observations .    currently , the only way to investigate the effects of dust attenuation on the observed kinematics of galaxies is by means of detailed radiative transfer modelling .",
    "many different approaches exist to handle the radiative transfer problem , and various teams have adopted different techniques to study the effect of dust on the photometry and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies ( e.g.  bruzual , magris & calvet 1988 ; witt , thronson & capuano 1992 ; byun , freeman & kylafis 1994 ; wise & silva 1996 ; bianchi , ferrara & giovanardi 1996 ; corradi , beckman & simonneau 1996 ; baes & dejonghe 2001a ) . the effect of dust attenuation on the observed kinematics , however , is largely unexplored , and limited to the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "davies ( 1990 ) argued that the effects of dust absorption on the observed optical rotation curve of a disc galaxy can lead to a severe underestimation of the true rotational velocity in the inner regions .",
    "this argument was quantified by bosma et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who calculated the effect of dust absorption on the observed rotation curve of edge - on galaxies .",
    "the most detailed work on this subject comes from matthews & wood ( 2001 ) , who calculate the effects of dust attenuation on the rotation curve of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies through monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have embarked on a program to systematically investigate the effects of dust on the observed kinematics of galaxies . in previous papers we focused on the effects of dust attenuation on the observed stellar kinematics of elliptical galaxies .",
    "initially , we only considered absorption by dust grains in our models ( baes & dejonghe  2000 ; baes , dejonghe & de rijcke  2000 ) .",
    "the inclusion of absorption in the calculation of the observed kinematics is a fairly simple procedure : it basically adds a weight to the contribution of each individual star along a line of sight .",
    "the radiative transfer problem becomes much more complicated however when scattering is also included . in this case",
    ", photons can leave their original path , such that any star can contribute to the observed kinematics in any line of sight .",
    "moreover , not only the stellar velocities but also the individual dust grain velocities should be taken into account in the calculation of the observed kinematics .",
    "we argue that the monte carlo method is the only radiative transfer modelling method in which kinematical information can be included in an elegant and straightforward way . using a one - dimensional spherical monte carlo code",
    ", we found that the effects of dust scattering are fairly important : dust attenuation can serve as an additional or alternative explanation for the stellar kinematical evidence of a dark matter halo around ellipticals ( baes & dejonghe 2001b , 2002a ) .    in this paper",
    ", we tackle the more complicated problem of investigating the effect of dust attenuation on the observed kinematics of disc galaxies .",
    "we have written a new monte carlo code ( skirt , acronym for stellar kinematics including radiative transfer ) that can handle any geometry of stars and dust .",
    "this code is presented in section [ skirt.sec ] , and tested in section [ test.sec ] .",
    "we present our model and the results of our monte carlo simulations in section [ results.sec ] .",
    "these results are discussed in section [ discussion.sec ] , and section [ conclusions.sec ] presents our conclusions .",
    "the basic characteristics of monte carlo radiative transfer have been explained at length by various authors ( e.g.  cashwell & everett 1959 ; mattila 1970 ; witt 1977 ; fischer , henning & yorke 1994 ; bianchi et al .",
    "in essence , a monte carlo radiative transfer code follows the life of a very large number of individual photons .",
    "a photon is , at each stage in its existence , characterized by various quantities , such as its position @xmath3 , propagation direction @xmath4 , wavelength @xmath5 and doppler shift @xmath6 as measured in a frame of rest . and",
    "the corresponding line - of - sight velocity @xmath6 , which are related by the expression @xmath7 . ] after being emitted , photons propagate on straight lines through the interstellar medium until they either interact with a dust grain or leave the galaxy .",
    "the various interactions alter the properties of the photon , according to random numbers generated from the appropriate probability functions .",
    "when at last the photon escapes from the galaxy , its final properties are recorded . after recording a large numbers of photons in this way , the global observed properties of the system can be calculated .",
    "we will not repeat an in - depth description of the principles and the numerous equations of monte carlo radiative transfer here , as they are well described in the articles listed above .",
    "instead , we will focus on a number of aspects which make our code different from the existing ones .",
    "these differences are mainly our choice of the dust grid and the possibility to include kinematical information into the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "when no kinematical information is included in the radiative transfer calculations , photons are characterized at each moment by a wavelength @xmath5 , a position @xmath3 and a direction @xmath4 .",
    "initial values for these quantities must be generated randomly from the emitting stellar system , which can be composed of several stellar components .",
    "the initial emission direction @xmath8 can be sampled from the unit sphere , the initial position @xmath9 is sampled from the spatial distribution of the stellar component , and the initial wavelength @xmath10 is sampled from the sed of the stellar component at the position @xmath9 .",
    "the skirt code contains a library with a set of common stellar components ( including spherical jaffe , hernquist , plummer and de vaucouleurs models , and axisymmetric exponential , sech , isothermal disc models ) , from which it is straightforward to sample a random position ( see appendix  a ) . another library contains a set of seds , including planck functions and realistic tabulated stellar and galaxy seds ( kinney et al .",
    "1996 ; pickles 1998 ) .",
    "this library also contains so - called monochromatic seds , which are described by a dirac delta function . sampling a random wavelength from",
    "the latter is trivial , because all photons are emitted with the same wavelength",
    ".    when the skirt code is used to calculate the observed kinematics of a dusty galaxy , photons must also carry with them the kinematic signature of the star that has emitted them , in the form of a doppler shift . because this is a one - dimensional quantity , not all kinematical information of the star can be transmitted to the observer , and it is important to consider how the observed doppler shift relates to the velocity vectors of the star and the scattering dust grains .",
    "this problem was discussed in detail in section 2.3 of baes & dejonghe ( 2002a ) , where it is shown that the general expression for the doppler shift after @xmath11 scattering events is @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the velocity vectors of the emitting star and the @xmath15th dust grain respectively .",
    "the initial value of the doppler shift attached to the photon is hence the component of the star in the direction of the original emission , @xmath16 .    to complete the initialization of a photon",
    ", we also need to generate a line - of - sight velocity from the appropriate probability distribution . in this case , this function is the spatial line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) @xmath17 , which describes the probability for a star at a position @xmath9 to have a velocity component @xmath6 in the direction @xmath8 . in general ,",
    "the spatial losvd is a marginal probability distribution of the stellar distribution function @xmath18 , which describes the probability density of the stellar component in six - dimensional phase space , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the stellar number density and the integration covers the entire velocity space perpendicular to the direction @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in order to be of use for a kinematical monte carlo run , each stellar component must allow the generation of a velocity from its spatial losvds for arbitrary @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the spatial losvds can be calculated analytically for a number of self - consistent spherical models .",
    "apart from isotropic models ( e.g.  plummer  1911 ; hnon  1959 ; jaffe  1983 ; hernquist  1990 ) , this is possible for the anisotropic families of plummer and hernquist models described by dejonghe  ( 1987 ) and baes & dejonghe  ( 2002b ) . for more complicated dynamical models ,",
    "however , an analytical evaluation of the spatial losvds is not possible .",
    "for such models , we approximate the velocity distribution at each position in the galaxy as a local gaussian distribution .",
    "this means that at each position @xmath3 , the distribution function can be written as @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{gaussf}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the mean velocities and velocity dispersions in the directions @xmath24 , the principle axes of the velocity ellipsoid at the position @xmath3 .",
    "the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid and the values of the mean velocities and velocity dispersions can vary from position to position , such that the distribution function ( [ gaussf ] ) represents a fairly general distribution function . but a distribution function of this form has the advantage that the spatial losvds can be calculated exactly for any direction @xmath4 by applying the formula ( [ defslosvd ] ) .",
    "we find that the spatial losvd will also be a gaussian distribution , @xmath25 , \\label{gaussianslosvd}\\ ] ] with parameters @xmath26 where obviously @xmath27 are the components of the vector @xmath4 with respect to the orthonormal reference system @xmath24 .",
    "if hence , for each stellar component , we specify the orientation and parameters of the velocity ellipsoid at each position @xmath3 , we can easily sample line - of - sight velocities from the spatial losvds in an arbitrary direction , and hence initialize the photons initial doppler shifts .      the life of a single photon can be thought of as a loop , whereby at each iteration ( representing a physical process ) we must update its position @xmath3 , propagation direction @xmath4 , wavelength @xmath5 and doppler shift @xmath6 .",
    "the initial values are determined randomly at the emission phase , and change at every scattering event . as we only consider coherent scattering , and we are not taking into account the re - emission of photons at longer wavelength , the only wavelength change of a photon along its path is due to the varying doppler shift .",
    "these wavelength variations are so tiny that the optical properties of the dust ( extinction curve , dust albedo and asymmetry parameter ) do not vary .",
    "the wavelength of a photon can hence be considered fixed throughout its lifetime .",
    "we must therefore only update the three quantities @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 at each iteration , from their old values ( @xmath28 ) to the new ones ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this proceeds in several steps .",
    "the first step in the iteration consists of determining whether an interaction with a dust grain will take place or whether the photon will leave the galaxy . to do this , we sample an optical depth @xmath30 from an exponential distribution and compare it to @xmath31 , the total optical depth along the path .",
    "when @xmath32 , the photon will leave the galaxy ; in the other case , the photon will interact with a dust grain .",
    "this interaction can either be a scattering or an absorption event , which is determined by the scattering albedo .",
    "in the former case , the photon will continue its journey through the galaxy , in the latter case , the loop is ended .",
    "the second step in the loop , if the photon is scattered , is the determination of the position of the scattering .",
    "therefore we have to translate the sampled optical depth @xmath30 to a physical path length @xmath33 . with this path length",
    "known , the new position is @xmath34 .",
    "the third step in the iteration is the determination of the new propagation direction @xmath35 of the photon .",
    "it is found by sampling a direction from the probability density @xmath36 , which represents the scattering phase function .",
    "various phase functions are built into the skirt code , including the isotropic phase function and the anisotropic henyey - greenstein phase function .",
    "the sampling of a direction from these phase functions can be performed analytically .",
    "the final step is to update the photon s doppler shift .",
    "the relative orientation of the propagation directions before and after the scattering event cause a change in doppler shift [ from equation ( [ vp ] ) ] @xmath37 to calculate the updated doppler shift , we need to sample a dust grain velocity from the dust velocity distribution .",
    "therefore , the dust components in the skirt library must not only be specified by a spatial distribution , but also by the entire phase space distribution @xmath38 .",
    "analogous to the stellar distribution function , we assume that the dust velocity field can be described by a trivariate gaussian distribution . because the dispersions in the interstellar medium are fairly small compared to the rotational velocities however , we restrict ourselves to assuming an isotropic dispersion tensor , such that @xmath39,\\ ] ] with @xmath40 and @xmath41 being the mean velocity vector and the velocity dispersion of the dust . similarly as in the stellar case , we do nt have to sample a full three - dimensional velocity vector for the dust , but only a component in the direction @xmath42 this means that we just have to sample a velocity from a one - dimensional gaussian distribution with mean velocity @xmath43 and dispersion @xmath44 .",
    "the first step in the iteration described in the previous subsection requires the calculation of the total optical depth along a given path .",
    "it is found through the integral @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the total ( absorption plus scattering ) opacity of the dust at a position @xmath3 . to execute the second step in the iteration",
    ", we need to convert an optical depth @xmath30 into a physical path length @xmath47 along a given path , which is done by solving the equation @xmath48 for @xmath49 . only for a few simple geometries , such as constant density or some spherical dust distributions ,",
    "can these integrations be performed analytically . in general , the calculation of the two quantities @xmath50 and @xmath47 must be performed numerically .",
    "these integrations are usually the most time - consuming part of monte carlo codes .",
    "therefore , it is important to think about an efficient and flexible way to do this ; we have considered two approaches .      in order to allow a completely arbitrary distribution of dust ( including clumpy dust distributions ) ,",
    "most modern radiative transfer monte carlo codes adopt an approach that can be described as a uniform dust density ( udd ) grid .",
    "it consists of dividing space into a number of cells , and attaching a uniform dust density to each cell , for example the value at the centre of the cell . this uniform density ( and hence opacity )",
    "makes it very easy to calculate the optical depth [ equation  ( [ task1 ] ) ] along a given path : simply calculate the distance that the photon runs through each cell it crosses , multiply this distance with the opacity in the cell , and add all the pieces together .",
    "the inversion of the equation ( [ task2 ] ) is not much more difficult .",
    "first , look for the cell in which the interaction will take place . since the opacity increases linearly with path length within a single cell ,",
    "this inversion of the equation is then straightforward .    in the skirt code",
    ", a udd grid is included based on a three - dimensional cartesian grid .",
    "the grid cells can be chosen arbitrarily , in order to achieve an efficient grid for a variety of dust distributions .",
    "an algorithm is included to construct clumpy dust distributions from an underlying smooth dust distribution , as described in witt & gordon ( 1996 ) and bianchi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "in addition to the udd grid , we explore a new approach to handle the integration through the dust : an interpolated dust density ( idd ) grid .",
    "the basis is the same : we divide space into a number of cartesian grid cells , but , instead of attaching a uniform opacity to each cell , we use the correct values of the opacity at the eight border points of the cells , and we apply a simple trilinear interpolation routine to determine the opacity in each of the points within a grid cell .",
    "consider a photon at the position @xmath51 , a position within the @xmath52th cell with border points @xmath53 , etc .",
    "we define the dimensionless quantities @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 as @xmath57 since @xmath54 increases linearly from 0 to 1 as @xmath58 moves linearly from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , and similarly for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the trilinear interpolation rule for the opacity simply reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 , etc .",
    "represent the opacity in the border points . now consider the fraction of the path that remains in this cell .",
    "this path can be parametrized using the expression @xmath63 , with the path length @xmath33 as a free parameter . in each of the points along this path ( as long as we remain in the same cell )",
    ", we can calculate the opacity by a similar formula as ( [ kappaintpol ] ) , @xmath64      \\left[1-q(s)\\right ]      \\left[1-r(s)\\right ]      \\kappa_{i , j , k }      \\nonumber \\\\      & \\quad+      \\left[1-p(s)\\right ]      \\left[1-q(s)\\right ]      r(s)\\ ,      \\kappa_{i , j , k+1 }      \\nonumber \\\\      & \\quad+      \\cdots      \\nonumber \\\\      & \\quad+      p(s)\\,q(s)\\,r(s)\\,\\kappa_{i+1,j+1,k+1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are now linear functions of the path length @xmath33 , @xmath65 along a path within a single cell , the opacity is thus a cubic polynomial in @xmath33 , the distance traveled along the path , @xmath66 with constant coefficients @xmath67 . with this expression for the opacity ,",
    "the calculation of the optical depth @xmath50 is very straightforward .",
    "indeed , it is sufficient to calculate , for each cell the path passes through , the two boundary positions .",
    "this enables us to calculate the path length @xmath33 within the cell and the coefficients @xmath67 .",
    "given these coefficients , the portion of the optical depth in that cell is found by substitution into the quartic polynomial @xmath68 also , the calculation of the path length @xmath47 is straightforward .",
    "first , we determine the cell in which the optical depths at the border points bracket the value of @xmath30 , in a similar way as described above to calculate the total optical depth along the path .",
    "the determination of @xmath33 then comes down to finding the root of a quartic equation . the obvious way of finding this root is by means of a newton - raphson iteration , because we can easily compute both the function values and the derivatives of this function .",
    "this routine has a very fast quadratic convergence ( the number of significant digits approximately doubles with each iteration ) .",
    "usually , no more than two iterations are necessary .",
    "to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the two approaches , we applied both techniques to a simple spherical dust geometry , characterized by an opacity @xmath69 the integrations through the dust , i.e.  the calculation of the two functions @xmath50 and @xmath47 , can be performed exactly for such a dust component with @xmath70 , 3 or 5 [ see baes ( 2001 ) for details ] .",
    "these exact results were compared with the results from the udd and idd grids . in figure  [ grid.eps ]",
    "we plot the relative error of the calculated values of the opacity , the total optical depth along a path and the path length corresponding to a given optical depth for 1000 randomly generated photons for such a model . for a given number of dust grid cells ,",
    "the accuracy of the integrations in the idd grid is much better than those in the udd grid .",
    "however , in terms of computational efficiency , comparing the two grids with the same numbers of cells is not fair , because the integrations in the udd grid are less complicated and hence faster .",
    "we found that the idd grid integrations are a factor 3 slower in the mean . on the other hand , in order to reach a similar accuracy as the idd grid , many more cells are necessary in the udd grid .",
    "apart from slowing down the integrations , this will also increase the memory requirements significantly .",
    "after several tests , we found that the idd grid is computationally preferable above the udd grid , in particular when the system harbours a large dynamical range of dust densities ( such as an exponential profile which is appropriate in disc galaxies ) .",
    "it should be noted however , that the udd grid still remains a very useful alternative , in particular to include clumpy dust distributions into the skirt code .",
    "the procedure described at the beginning of the previous section is the most basic version of a monte carlo iteration step . when executed as such",
    ", however , it would be very inefficient . throughout the years a number of intelligent tricks have been presented which increase the computational efficiency considerably .",
    "most of them attach a weight to each photon , which can be altered during its lifetime .",
    "we incorporate three such techniques into our skirt code .",
    "the first optimization to the basic monte carlo scenario is to turn all interactions into scattering events . in reality , of course , the interaction between a photon and a dust grain can either be an absorption or a scattering event ; the nature of this event is determined by the albedo @xmath71 of the dust grains .",
    "the problem with absorptions is that the photon is lost , and therefore does not contribute to the observed radiation field anymore . to overcome this problem",
    ", we force each interaction to be a scattering event and alter the weight of the photon after each scattering by a factor @xmath71 in order to compensate for the fraction of absorbed photons .",
    "the second technique is the peeling - off procedure introduced by yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "in the basic monte carlo iteration , each photon leaves the galaxy at a certain stage , and it can be classified in bins according to its position and direction .",
    "this approach has a number of disadvantages .",
    "firstly , if we are interested in only one single observing position , most of the photons are not used . secondly ,",
    "if the observer has the misfortunate of being located in a direction in which not many photons leave the galaxy , he might have to wait for a very long time to detect enough photons to obtain good statistics .",
    "thirdly , if one wants to compare the view of a system from two observing positions close to each other , the direction bins must be chosen to be very small , which requires a very large number of photons .",
    "the peeling - off technique can be used to tackle these problems .",
    "it consists of creating a new photon during each scattering [ resp .",
    "emission ] process , which is scattered [ resp .",
    "emitted ] exactly in the direction of the observer .",
    "this photon will be detected by the observer .",
    "its weight is altered by a factor @xmath72 [ resp .  1 ] to compensate for the probability of scattering [ resp .",
    "emission ] in the direction @xmath73 , and a factor @xmath74 $ ] to compensate for extinction along the line - of - sight .",
    "the third optimization we apply is the principle of forced first scattering ( witt 1977 ) , which is useful in the relatively low optical depth regime .",
    "a problem in such systems is that most of the photons leave the galaxy directly without a single interaction with a dust grain , and therefore many photons need to be generated in order to have a good statistics of the scattered radiation . to overcome this problem , we split the emitted photon into two parts .",
    "the first part of the photon directly leaves the galaxy and obtains a weight @xmath75 ( because we adopt the peeling - off technique , we do nt have to consider this fraction anymore ) .",
    "the other part of the photon with the remaining weight is forced to be scattered at least once , which is achieved by sampling an optical depth @xmath30 such that @xmath76 .",
    "this technique is called the principle of forced first scattering , but nothing prevents us applying it only to freshly emitted photons : it can equally well be applied to scattered photons ( bianchi et al .",
    "the number of forced scatterings we apply in our calculations is usually 3 , but this value can be set arbitrarily according to the studied system .",
    "the last phase in the monte carlo cycle is the detection phase , whereby the information contained in the photon is transmitted to the observer . because of the peeling - off procedure , the number and position of the observers can be chosen randomly . at each observing position",
    ", the user can choose from several simulated instruments to detect the photons : photometers , low - resolution and high - resolution spectrographs .",
    "each instrument consists of a number of pixels on the plane of the sky and they come in two geometries : rectangular and circular . each pixel contains a detector , the nature of which depends on the kind of instrument .",
    "the photometers are the most simple instruments , whereby the detector in each pixel is just a counter . every time a photon hits the pixel and its wavelength is within the detector s bandwidth",
    ", its weight is added to the intensity . at the end of the simulation , the 2d surface brightness image of the system is directly obtained .",
    "the photometers are designed such that each photon remembers the number of scatterings it has undergone , and this information is also used by the photometric detectors .",
    "this allows us to construct images for each individual scattering ( direct emission , photons that have been scattered once , etc . ) , which can be useful to disentangle the effects of absorption and scattering .    the low - resolution spectrographs work in a very similar way , except that there is not just one detector , but a range of detectors corresponding to different wavelength bins .",
    "in this way a data cube is produced ( actually a set of data cubes , one for every scattering ) , very similar to the data cubes obtained by radio or fabry - perot observations .",
    "the high - resolution spectrographs basically produce similar data cubes , with doppler shift bins replacing the wavelength bins . combining the different doppler shift bins at a given position @xmath77 on the sky",
    ", we obtain the losvd or line profile @xmath78 , which describes the entire projected velocity distribution . from the losvds ,",
    "the 2d mean projected velocity field @xmath79 and projected velocity dispersion field @xmath80 can be calculated .    from a conceptual point of view ,",
    "high - resolution and low - resolution spectrographs work in a very similar way .",
    "both separate the incoming photons in different bins according to the extra information carried by the photon , which is the wavelength in the former and the doppler shift in the latter case . from a computational point of view",
    ", however , there is an important difference between the two .",
    "indeed , the wavelength of the photon is actively used throughout the monte carlo iteration , because the optical properties of the dust grains depend on the photon s wavelength . on the contrary , a photon s path does not depend on its doppler shift . moreover , the changes in doppler shift experienced by a photon when it moves through the dust are independent of the initial stellar doppler shift .",
    "therefore , we can optimize our code in the following way . instead of initializing the photon s doppler shift by generating a @xmath81 from the stellar spatial losvd",
    ", we postpone this contribution of the stellar velocity until later and initialize @xmath81 to zero .",
    "when the photon leaves the galaxy after @xmath11 scattering events , it will then carry a doppler shift @xmath82 where we still have to add the stellar doppler shift in order to obtain the correct value . instead of generating a single initial stellar doppler shift @xmath81 from the spatial losvd @xmath17 , we split the photon over all velocity bins .",
    "each fraction will then be weighted by a weight factor that represents the probability that the final doppler shift of the photon will fall within the corresponding bin . in order to fall within a bin with boundaries @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    ", the photon must have an initial stellar doppler shift satisfying @xmath85 .",

    "the jeans equations yield that the vertical velocity dispersion scales with the square root of the surface density .",
    "if we assume a constant mass - to - light ratio , we obtain the following parametrization , @xmath114 as all dispersions in a stellar disc are thought to exist from the gradual stellar heating of an initial cold disc , it makes sense to assume that the velocity dispersions in the other direction are intimately coupled to the vertical dispersion .",

    "the projected mean velocity profile along the major axis rises more and more slowly as the optical depth increases , and tends towards a solid body rotation .",
    "these trends were expected , and in agreement with the arguments of davies  ( 1990 ) and the absorption - only calculations of bosma et al .  ( 1992 ) . to quantify this change of slope , we have calculated , for each optical depth , the major axis radius at which the mean projected velocity reaches half of its maximum value @xmath127  kms@xmath128 .",
    "these values are tabulated in the second column of table  [ rot.tab ] , and demonstrate that the effects of dust attenuation are very severe , even for small optical depths .",
    "the reason for this shallower slope of the rotation curve is that we mainly see the radiation from the optically thin part of the galaxy , which is more and more restricted to the outer part of the galaxy as the optical depth increases .    in the same way",
    ", we can understand the effects of dust attenuation on the projected velocity dispersion profile , where also a prominent dust lane is visible in the contour plot : we mainly see the light ( and hence the doppler shift ) of the stars from the outer part of the disc , where the intrinsic velocity dispersion is much smaller .",
    "bosma et al .  (",
    "1992 ) found that the signature of dust absorption on the rotation curve depends strongly on the inclination angle . for inclinations which deviate as few as 5 degrees from purely edge - on",
    ", they found that the effects of dust on the rotation curve is already severely reduced , even for optical depths up to @xmath129 .",
    "this result remains the same if scattering is also taken into account , because the absorption effects of dust strongly dominate in highly inclined galaxies .",
    "table  [ rot.tab ] quantitatively demonstrates these results .",
    "for the projected velocity dispersion , a similar effect is valid , at least for the major axis dispersion profile . when the entire projected velocity dispersion field ( or just the minor axis dispersion profile ) is taken into account , the asymmetrical signature of the dust",
    "can still be recognized for inclinations down to 80 degrees .    moving to intermediate inclinations",
    ", the effects of dust attenuation on the observed kinematics quickly become very limited . for example",
    ", there is hardly any effect noticeable for an inclination of 60 degrees , which can easily be seen by comparing the corresponding panels in figure  [ mw_vp.eps ] and  [ mw_sigp.eps ] .      in the light of the previous results",
    ", we would expect that the effects of dust attenuation on the observed kinematics of face - on galaxies are completely neglegible . and",
    "indeed , on the mean projected velocity there is no effect at all : the projected mean velocity is zero for face - on galaxies , regardless of whether dust is present or not .",
    "however , we do see a conspicuous effect of dust attenuation on the projected velocity dispersion : it increases with increasing optical depth",
    ". this can not be an absorption effect , because all stars along a given line of sight in our face - on galaxy discs have the same velocity dispersion @xmath117 in the direction of the observer .",
    "the effect arises as a result of photons emitted in the central regions in a direction parallel to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "when these photons are scattered into a vertical direction , they have a large probability to leave the galaxy .",
    "they will then contribute the high - velocity information of the stars in the central regions to the losvds , causing high - velocity wings and hence an increased velocity dispersion .",
    "the effect is similar to what we found for the projected velocity dispersion profile of elliptical galaxies containing a diffuse dust component ( baes & dejonghe  2002a ) .",
    "compared to these models , where the signature of the dust is very significant , it is fairly modest for the face - on discs .",
    "the reason for this weaker impact is the fact that the velocity dispersion profile in our disc galaxy models have a fairly shallow slope , compared to the elliptical galaxy models of baes & dejonghe ( 2002a ) . in disc galaxies ,",
    "the doppler shifts contributed by the scattered photons will in the mean differ less from the doppler shifts contributed by the direct photons as in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we could ask ourselves the question whether this conclusion is biased by the chosen star - dust geometry of our disc galaxy models . indeed , baes & dejonghe  ( 2002a ) found their results depended strongly on the relative star - dust geometry : the scattering effect was strong only for models in which the dust was more extended than the stars . in our disc galaxy models , the dust distribution has the same scale length as the stars , whereas the scale height is smaller , such that the dust is always sandwiched between the stars .",
    "recently however , evidence has been found for extended distributions of cold dust in spiral galaxies , both from the radiative transfer modelling of the dust lanes in edge - on galaxies ( xilouris et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) and from iso and scuba dust emission ( alton et al .",
    "1999 ; davies et al .  1999 ) . in order to investigate whether this would bias our results , we considered a new set of models with an extended dust distribution .",
    "they were constructed by increasing the dust scale length or the dust scale height by factors up to three , while keeping the face - on optical depth fixed .",
    "running new face - on simulations for these models , we found that the strength of the scattering effect on the projected velocity dispersion increases only minimally , with deviations of the order of a few per cent .",
    "the modest effects found in figure  [ mwkin.eps ] are hence representative for disc galaxies .",
    "one of the most useful and promising applications of stellar kinematics in disc galaxies is their contribution to mass modelling . in its simplest form ,",
    "this mass modelling consists of decomposing the observed rotation curve into contributions by the disc and the dark halo ( assuming the contributions of a bulge and molecular / atomic gas are negligible ) . even in this most simple scenario ,",
    "there is still a virtually complete degeneracy : the mass - to - light ratio of the disc .",
    "authors have often adopted a solution in which the contribution of the disc is maximized , leading to the so - called maximum disc hypothesis ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ) .",
    "there are however , no convincing arguments to favour a particular value for the stellar mass - to - light ratio , and often scenarios in which the dark matter halo dominates the disc are equally possible ( e.g.  lake & feinswog 1989 ) .",
    "stellar kinematics can , in principle , provide the necessary additional constraint to break this degeneracy .",
    "indeed , for a self - gravitating disc , the vertical velocity dispersion scales linearly with the square root of the surface density of the disc , and can therefore be used to constrain the mass - to - light ratio of the disc .",
    "the most obvious candidates for such an analysis would be face - on galaxies , because their projected velocity dispersion directly reflects the vertical velocity dispersion in the disc .",
    "we found that for a dusty disc galaxy , the observed velocity dispersion is affected by scattering .",
    "the effects are modest , however , even for models with an extended dust distribution . alas",
    ", face - on galaxies do have strong observational disadvantages .",
    "foremost , their low surface brightness make it very hard to obtain the stellar kinematics out to sufficiently large distances to isolate the disc component .",
    "moreover , the shape and amplitude of the rotation curve can not be measured directly .",
    "the amplitude can be estimated fairly accurate using the tully - fisher relation , whereas the shape could be approximated through the ( controversial ) universal rotation curve formalism ( persic , salucci & stel  1996 ) .",
    "this is unsatisfactory , however , because there is a large spread in universal rotation curves , and the details of mass modelling usually depend crucially on small scale features of the rotation curve which statistical methods can not incorporate .",
    "edge - on galaxies do nt suffer from these observational problems : their surface brightness is much higher , and their apparent rotation curve can be determined directly .",
    "however , the interpretation of the kinematical data is non - trivial .",
    "firstly , the vertical velocity dispersion must be linked to the observed dispersion , which is a mixture of contributions from the radial and tangential velocity components .",
    "based on the observed axis ratio of velocity ellipsoid in the solar neighborhood , bottema ( 1993 ) estimated the vertical velocity dispersion in edge - on galaxies by means of the radial velocity dispersion evaluated at one scale length .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the velocity ellipsoid axis ratios in disc galaxies can vary substantially ( gerssen et al .",
    "secondly , our modelling indicates that both the projected mean velocity and the projected velocity dispersion field in edge - on galaxies are strongly affected by interstellar dust .",
    "galaxies of an intermediate inclination ( @xmath130 ) , however , are most suitable for such an analysis .",
    "gerssen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that for galaxies with an intermediate inclination , the three components of the velocity ellipsoid can , in principle , be determined by studying the kinematics along major and minor axes . also ,",
    "because the rotation curve of inclined galaxies can directly be determined and their surface brightnesses are high enough to allow the measurements of their kinematics in a reasonable time , they form ideal targets for such a study . moreover ,",
    "determining the three components of the velocity ellipsoid is very useful to constrain the dynamical history of disc galaxies , because the various proposed mechanisms leave a different imprint on the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "our modelling demonstrates that the observed kinematics of inclined disc galaxies can be directly interpreted and are not biased by dust attenuation .",
    "we argue that studying the observed kinematics of a substantial set of optically smooth inclined galaxies could thus greatly contribute to understanding the mass structure and dynamical history of spiral galaxies .",
    "the results of our modelling are important concerning the derivation of the rotation curve of spiral galaxies . whereas the outer parts of the rotation curves of spirals were the preferred field of interest for nearly three decades , it is the inner slope of the rotation curve which nowadays stands in the spotlight . to measure the slope in this inner region accurately ,",
    "a high spatial resolution is required , which makes the usual 21-cm measurements less suitable , except for the most nearby galaxies .",
    "a useful alternative are co rotation curves , which can achieve a high resolution in both the spatial and velocity directions , but these observations are quite costly in observing time . the main alternative remains optical h@xmath2 observations , either long - slit or fabry - perot .",
    "using h@xmath2 rotation curves , several authors ( blais - ouellette , amram & carignan 2001 ; borriello & salucci 2001 ; de blok , mcgaugh & rubin 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ) have recently found shallow slopes for the inner rotation curve of a significant number of ( mainly lsb and dwarf ) galaxies .",
    "such slopes are not in agreement with the results of high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations , where it is found that dark matter halos have a strong cusp , and hence that rotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies should be steeply rising ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "a number of `` solutions '' have been proposed to explain this discrepancy , amongst them the suggestion that the internal extinction in the centre of galaxies could be a major source of uncertainty .",
    "our models show that , indeed , an edge - on galaxy with an observed slowly rising rotation curve could in principle be a _",
    "dusty _ galaxy with an intrinsically steep rotation curve .",
    "we found , however , that this effect can not be obtained with realistic amounts of dust if the galaxies deviate more than a few degrees from exactly edge - on , confirming the results of bosma et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and matthews & wood ( 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , because lsb galaxies are assumed to be dust poor ( mcgaugh  1994 , tully et al .  1998 ;",
    "matthews et al .",
    "1999 ) , we have demonstrated that dust effects can not explain the observed discrepancies .    we do however demonstrate that dust effects are important for galaxies within a few degrees from edge - on , and that dust attenuation must be seriously taken into account in such cases .",
    "the calculation of the final doppler shift of a photon in the skirt code takes into account the velocity information of the star and the individual velocity vectors of each individual scattering dust grain .",
    "this means that for every scattering event , we need to sample a velocity from the dust velocity field , and this is a costly operator .",
    "it would be very convenient from a computational point of view , if we could neglect the dust grain velocities .",
    "we have done this in our previous monte carlo simulations ( baes & dejonghe 2001b , 2002a ) , where we studied the observed stellar kinematics of elliptical galaxies . in these models , both stars and dust grains",
    "are supported by random motions , and because the dust is colder than the stars , the extra doppler shifts due to scattering are generally smaller than the stellar doppler shift . in a spiral galaxy , however , this argument does not hold anymore , because the velocities of both stars and dust grains are dominated by the rotation and are therefore of the same magnitude .    in order to investigate the importance of including the individual dust grain velocities into the code ,",
    "we ran the same models again but without taking the dust velocities into account . in figure  [ mwappkin.eps ]",
    "we plot the major and minor axes mean projected velocity and projected velocity dispersion profiles of our models calculated this way . comparing this figure with the corresponding this figure with figure  [ mwkin.eps ] , we find that the effects of dust on the mean projected velocity profiles are significantly overestimated when the dust grain velocities are not taken into account , in particular for inclined galaxies .",
    "the differences between the projected velocity dispersion curves in both figures are even worse : when the dust grain velocities are neglected , the apparent effect of dust attenuation is to increase the dispersion at nearly all radii and all inclinations , by factors of up to 200 per cent or more for realistic optical depths .    to understand this behaviour ,",
    "consider a photon emitted by a star with velocity @xmath13 in the direction @xmath8 , and assume this photon is scattered by a dust grain with velocity @xmath131 into the direction @xmath132 , whereafter it manages to escape the galaxy .",
    "when we do not take the dust grain velocity into account , the observed doppler shift of the photon will simply be @xmath133 .",
    "on the contrary , the correct observed doppler shift of the photon reads @xmath134 in a disc galaxy , the motion of both stars and dust grains is dominated by the same rotation .",
    "if the pathlength of the photon between its emission and scattering is short , the velocity vectors of the star and dust grain will therefore be very similar , @xmath135 , such that @xmath136 .",
    "the new correct doppler shift is hence a typical line - of - sight velocity of a star in the new propagation direction @xmath132 of the photon .",
    "therefore , taking the dust motion into account more or less forces the dust grain to adopt a doppler shift that is `` appropriate '' for the new propagation direction . along a given line - of - sight ,",
    "the velocity information carried by scattered photons will , in the mean , only modestly deviate from the velocity information carried by photons directly emitted in same direction .",
    "if we do nt take the dust grain velocities into account , the photon can contribute , to the observed kinematics in a given direction , a line - of - sight velocity typical for a completely different direction .",
    "in the elliptical galaxy models from baes & dejonghe ( 2002a ) , this does not make much difference , because the velocities of the stars have similar magnitudes in the different directions . in a rotating disc galaxy however , this makes a huge difference because the stars have hugely different velocities in different directions : the vertical and radial motions are determined by the dispersion and are of the order of a few tens of km / s , whereas the azimuthal motion is dominated by the rotation and is of the order of 200 km / s .",
    "if the dust grain velocities are not correctly taken into account , scattered photons can thus cause erroneous extremely - high - velocity wings in the losvds .",
    "these give rise to modest but significant errors in the mean projected velocity , and very large errors in the projected velocity dispersion .    as a remark",
    ", we want to point out that matthews & wood ( 2001 ) found that `` also including the doppler shifts arising from the relative bulk motion of the scattering dust particles had a negligible effect on the final rotation curves '' . whereas this statement is indeed true for the mean projected velocity of highly inclined galaxies",
    ", we nevertheless judge that this could easily be misinterpreted as a justification to neglect dust velocities altogether .",
    "it must be realized that for the calculation of the entire losvds , and for the projected velocity dispersion in particular , the dust velocities do play a crucial role , and must be taken into account .",
    "in this paper we have presented a novel monte carlo code that can take velocity information into account , and can hence be used for kinematical modelling of dusty objects .",
    "we applied this code to calculate the observed kinematics of dusty disc galaxies .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "a correct inclusion of kinematical information into radiative transfer problems requires the inclusion of the velocities of both the emitting stars and the scattering dust grains .",
    "we see no other way of tackling this problem except with monte carlo techniques .",
    "a new approach is presented to optimize the integration through the dust in a monte carlo code , using a trilinear interpolation instead of a constant opacity within each cell .",
    "we compared both kinds of grids , and find that , to obtain a similar accuracy , the new approach is more efficient in terms of computation time and memory .",
    "the effects of dust attenuation on the kinematics of edge - on disc galaxies are severe .",
    "both the mean projected velocity and the projected velocity dispersion are severely affected , even for modest optical depths .",
    "therefore we strongly advise to always interprete the stellar kinematics and optical rotation curves of edge - on galaxies very cautiously .",
    "4 .   for galaxies which are more than a few degrees from strictly edge - on , the effects of interstellar dust on the observed kinematics are much weaker .",
    "therefore , we argue that dust attenuation can not be invoked as a possible mechanism to reconcile the observed slope of lsb galaxies with the predicted cdm cosmological models . 5 .",
    "dust attenuation does not affect the kinematics of intermediately inclined galaxies .",
    "such galaxies hence form the ideal targets for stellar kinematical studies , in particular to constrain the mass structure and to study the kinematical history of disc galaxies .",
    ".   the projected velocity dispersion of face - on galaxies increases slightly due to scattering of dust grains into the line of sight .",
    "the effects are relatively small , however , even for extended dust distributions .",
    "7 .   neglecting the extra doppler effect caused by the scattering medium results in incorrect projected kinematics , in particular if the velocity components of the stars ( and dust grains ) in the galaxy differ considerably , such as in a rotating disc .",
    "if the dust grain velocities are neglected , the mean projected velocity is significantly underestimated , and the projected velocity dispersion field is completely overestimated .",

    "in this appendix , we show how the skirt code generates a random position from the exponential disc model , i.e.  how a random position is drawn from the three - dimensional probability density @xmath137 as this probability density is a separable function of @xmath108 , @xmath138 and @xmath109 , we can generate a random position by independently generating each of these three coordinates , whereby the generation of an azimuth is trivial . to generate a random radius and height",
    ", we use the transformation technique , which says that a random variable @xmath58 can be drawn from a probability density @xmath139 by generating a uniform deviate @xmath140 and solving the equation @xmath141 for @xmath58 .",
    "the calculation of a random @xmath109 is easy using this principle and results in @xmath142 this procedure works equally well when we introduce a cut - off , or when a sech or isothermal profile is used instead of the exponential profile to describe the vertical distribution of the stars ( e.g.  bianchi et al .  1996 ) .    applying the same technique to generate a random @xmath108 , we can find @xmath108 by solving the equation @xmath143 bianchi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) invert this transcendental equation numerically to find @xmath108 .",
    "however , this equation can be solved exactly by means of the lambert function , yielding @xmath144.\\ ] ] the lambert function , also known as the product log function , is generally defined as the inverse of the function @xmath145 , and @xmath146 represents the only real branch of this complex function besides the principle branch .",
    "the lambert function can be computed in a very efficient way by means of halley iteration ; for more information on this function see corless et al ."
