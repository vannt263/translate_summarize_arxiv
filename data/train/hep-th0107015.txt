    "the analysis of the structure and properties , as well as the evaluation of exact form factors , is one of the central problems in 1 + 1 dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "one of the main reasons for their distinct role is that they serve to compute very efficiently correlations functions of local operators @xmath1 . instead of a perturbative expansion in the coupling constant",
    "one may expand the correlation functions in terms of exact expressions of n - particle form factors , that is the matrix element of a local operator @xmath1 located at the origin between a multiparticle in - state and the vacuum @xmath2 the operators @xmath3 are creation operators for a particle of type @xmath4 as a function of the rapidity @xmath5 .",
    "since the original proposal of this method to evaluate correlation functions @xcite , various schemes have been suggested to compute these objects .",
    "one of the original approaches is modeled in spirit closely on the set up for the determination of exact scattering matrices .",
    "it consists of solving a system of consistency equations which have to hold for the n - particle form factors based on some natural physical assumptions , like unitarity , crossing and bootstrap fusing properties @xcite @xmath6 @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the factor of so - called local commutativity defined through the equal time exchange relation of the local operator @xmath1 and the field @xmath9 associated to the particle creation operators @xmath3@xmath10 the factor @xmath8 is very often omitted in the analysis or simply taken to be one , but it can be seen that already in the ising model it is needed to set up the equations consistently @xcite .",
    "a consequence of its presence is that a frequently made statement has to be revised , namely , that ( [ w1])-([kin ] ) constitute operator independent equations , which require as the only input the s - matrices @xmath11 between particles of type @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a function of the rapidity difference @xmath14 . in the following manuscript we demonstrate that apart from @xmath15 , which already occur in the literature , this factor can be a non - trivial phase .",
    "thus the form factor consistency equations contain also explicitly non - trivial properties of the operators .",
    "trying to find solutions to these equations has been pursuit successfully for many models and has led to the determination of closed exact expressions for n - particle form factors for a wide class of local operators @xmath1 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "alternatively some authors develop methods which borrow ideas which have proven to be very powerful in the context of conformal field theory , where the use of symmetries and their related algebras has led to a successful determination of correlation functions @xcite . yet",
    ", the most direct way to compute the matrix elements in ( [ 1 ] ) is to find explicit representations for the operators @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "for instance in the context of lattice models this is a rather familiar situation and one knows how to compute matrix elements of the type ( [ 1 ] ) directly .",
    "the problem is then reduced to a purely computational task ( albeit non - trivial ) , which may , for instance , be solved by well - known techniques of algebraic bethe ansatz type , e.g. @xcite . in the context of field theory",
    "a similar way of attack to the problem has been followed by exploiting a free field representation for the operators @xmath3 and @xmath1 , in form of heisenberg algebras or their q - deformed version .",
    "so far a successful computation of the n - particle form factors with this approach is limited to a rather restricted set of models and in particular for the sine - gordon model , which is a model extensively studied by means of other approaches @xcite , only the free fermion point can be treated successfully @xcite so far .",
    "one of the main purpose of this manuscript is to advocate yet another approach , namely the evaluation of the matrix elements ( [ 1 ] ) based on an expansion of the operators in the conventional fermionic fock space . recalling the well - known fact that in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions the notions of spin and statistics are not intrinsic , it is clear that both approaches are legitimate .",
    "since the model we mainly consider in this manuscript , the federbush model , is closely related to complex free fermions the usage of fermionic fock operators seems natural . nonetheless , we expect this procedure to hold in more generality and to allow an extension to other models .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in section 2 we recall an explicit fermionic free field representation for the particle creation operators @xmath3 occurring in ( [ 1 ] ) valid for all diagonal scattering matrices . in section 3",
    "we treat the complex free fermion , we provide a generic expression for a potentially local operator and specialize it to particular operators whose form factors we directly compute , namely the order and disorder field and various components of the energy - momentum tensor . in section 4",
    "we extend this analysis to the federbush model and show in particular how it is related to homogeneous sine - gordon ( hsg ) models on the level of the scattering matrix .",
    "in addition we analyze the momentum space cluster property .",
    "we pay special attention to the factor of local commutativity . in section 5",
    "we propose a lie algebraic generalization of the federbush model . in section 6",
    "we sustain the relation between the federbush and the hsg - models by carrying out the ultraviolet limit .",
    "we state our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "in order to proceed in the way as outlined above , we have to provide explicit representations for the creation operators @xmath16 and the fields @xmath1 .",
    "the former operators are characterized by their braiding behaviour , i.e. when they are exchanged they pick up the scattering matrix as a structure constant .",
    "we restrict our considerations in this manuscript to theories in which backscattering is absent , such that the exchange algebra for the @xmath17-operators reads @xcite @xmath18z_{j}^{\\dagger } ( \\theta _ { j})z_{i}^{\\dagger } ( \\theta _ { i})\\ , .",

    "identical relations hold for the annihilation operators , i.e. @xmath20 in ( [ zf ] ) .",
    "when we braid a creation and an annihilation operator the presence of an additional central term was suggested in @xcite @xmath21 which ensures that one recovers the usual ( fermionic ) bosonic ( anti)-commutation relations in the case ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 . the relations ( [ zf])-([zf2 ] )",
    "are commonly referred to as faddeev - zamolodchikov ( fz ) algebra .",

    "the latter construction may be viewed as a continuous version of a jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , albeit on the lattice the commutation relations are not purely bosonic or fermionic , since certain operators anti - commute at the same site but commute on different sites .",
    "alternatively , one may also replace the bosonic @xmath27 s in ( [ real ] ) by operators satisfying the usual fermionic anti - commutation relations @xmath28 and note that the relations ( [ zf ] ) are still satisfied @xcite . in the following we want to work with this fermionic representation of the fz - algebra ( [ zf ] ) .",
    "having obtained a fairly simple realization for the @xmath29-operators , we may now seek to represent the operator content of the theory in the same space .",
    "in general , this is not known and we have to resort to a study of explicit models at this stage .",
    "to illustrate the procedure , to fix some of our notations and to set the scene for the federbush model , we will commence with the free fermion .",

    "it is clear that @xmath73 is a meaningful field in the weak sense , that is acting on an in - state we will recover by construction the form factor related to @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , one may also construct the well - known expression of the two - point correlation function expanded in terms of form factors , as stated in @xcite .",
    "however , it is also clear that @xmath74 simply by comparing ( [ crap ] ) and the explicit expressions for some local fields occurring in the free fermionic theory , e.g. ( [ aux ] ) , ( [ aux1 ] ) and ( [ aux2 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that acting on an in - state with the latter expressions the form factors are generated in a non - trivial wick contraction procedure , whereas when doing the same with ( [ crap ] ) the wick contractions will be trivial . therefore general statements and conclusions drawn from an analysis made on @xmath73 should be taken with care .",
    "it is also needless to say that from a practical point of view the expression ( [ crap ] ) is rather empty , since the expressions of the form factors @xmath75 themselves are usually not known and their determination is in general a quite non - trivial task . in @xcite",
    "the integration in the formula ( [ crap ] ) is a rather artificial contour integration which takes care about analytic continuations of values of @xmath76 .",

    "we introduced here the fields @xmath80 admittedly , the precise form of the fields @xmath81 appears to be slightly unmotivated at this stage .",
    "however , we will provide a better rational for this in the next section , where we see that they originate by relating a so - called triple normal ordering procedure for a field , which can be constructed directly from the fourier decomposition of the free fermi fields ( [ free ] ) , to another one associated with the usual wick normal ordering .",
    "it will turn out that the field @xmath81 emerges as the limit of a federbush model field to the free fermionic theory , i.e. @xmath82 , see equation ( [ om ] ) .",

    "the product expressions for @xmath123 and @xmath124 were also derived in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , by means of solving the form factor consistency equations ( [ w1])-([kin ] ) .      a further field which plays an important role in any theory is the energy - momentum tensor , which for the free fermion in our normalization simply reads @xmath125 with the help of equation ( [ free ] ) we compute easily @xmath126 using @xmath127 where we recall the definition of @xmath128 from ( [ aux ] ) .",
    "a specially distinct role is played by the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , since on one hand it is directly proportional to the operator which breaks the conformal invariance @xcite and on the other hand it occurs explicitly in various computations associated to the ultraviolet limit like the c - theorem @xcite and the @xmath129-sum rule @xcite ( see section 5 ) .",

    "the federbush model @xcite was proposed forty years ago as a prototype for an exactly solvable quantum field theory which obeys the wightman axioms @xcite .",
    "formally it is closely related to the massive thirring model @xcite .",
    "it contains two different massive particles @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "indeed , we find that @xmath329 thus precisely at the value of the coupling constant of the federbush model at which the @xmath182-hsg s - matrix reduces in the limit ( [ sfeder ] ) to the @xmath192 , the operator content of the two models overlaps .",
    "we computed explicitly the form factors of the complex free fermion and the federbush model related to various operators . on one hand we carried out this task by representing explicitly the field content as well as the particle creation operator in terms of fermionic fock operators and",
    "computed thereafter directly the corresponding matrix elements . on the other hand we verified that these expressions satisfy the form factor consistency equations only when the operators under consideration are mutually local",
    "this can already be seen for the free fermion , for which we could have also computed the matrix element of the field @xmath205 . in that context one",
    "observes that only for @xmath201 this function solves the consistency equations ( [ w1])-([kin ] ) .",
    "we observed a similar phenomenon in the federbush model .",
    "whereas the matrix elements of the field @xmath229 can be computed in a closed form for generic values of @xmath151 , they become only meaningful form factors for @xmath201 , that is when the field becomes local .",
    "it turned out to be crucial that the consistency equations contain the factor of local commutativity as defined in ( [ local ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that this factor is related to the equal time exchange relation between the operator and the field associated to the particle next to it in the multi - particle state .",
    "we demonstrated how the scattering matrix of the federbush model can be obtained as a limit of the @xmath182-hsg scattering matrix .",
    "this `` correspondence '' also holds for the central charge , which equals @xmath316 in both cases , and the scaling dimension of the disorder operator at a certain value of the coupling constant .",
    "we proposed a lie algebraic generalization of the federbush models , which on the other hand can be obtained in a certain limit of the homogeneous sine - gordon models .      *",
