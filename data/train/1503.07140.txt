    "this data is the two - electron equivalent of fig .",
    "[ fig : timedist](a ) .",
    "we see that electron b arrives at the detector 340  ps before electron a , consistent with our estimate of four sampling intervals , and with energy @xmath120 mev below the energy of electron a. fig .",
    "[ fig : twoelectron](d ) shows schematically the relative emission points of the two electrons in the pumping waveform , based on our earlier modeling .",
    "the observed energy gap is in contrast to the results of ubbelohde _ et al _ , @xcite who found that for two - electron pumping using a sinusoidal waveform the electrons had equal emission energy , which they attributed to the out - tunneling rate @xmath97 depending only on the difference between the energy of the top - most electron and the detector barrier height",
    ". however , our result agrees with that of fletcher _",
    "et al _ , @xcite who found that the first - emitted electron ( b ) had lower energy and argued that additional factors may enhance the emission rate when two electrons are bound in the pump , so electron b can be emitted with lower energy than in the single - electron case .",
    "this may depend on the device geometry , leading to the differing results of refs . and .",
    "finally , we show how engineering of the pumping waveform can be used to manipulate the two - electron time and energy gap .",
    "we modify the pumping waveform @xmath3  so that the voltage step @xmath121 during one particular sampling interval within the emission region is much larger than for the rest of the steps ( large step 128 mv , compared to 16 mv for the other steps ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wfm110](e ) illustrates this waveform schematically , including the 12-ghz ripple , for the emission part of the pumping cycle .",
    "introducing the large step causes profound changes in the electron emission , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfm110](a ) , where we plot the two - electron energy distribution resulting from the modified pumping waveform as a function of @xmath1 . features due to electron a(b ) are marked with green solid ( red dashed ) lines as a guide to the eyes . compared to pumping with the digital sine wave [ fig .",
    "[ fig : twoelectron](b ) ] , the main change is that emission during the large - step sampling interval occurs over a much wider interval of @xmath1 , with a very large increase in energy for the most negative @xmath1  of this interval .",
    "we do not attempt to understand this situation quantitatively , because it is not known how the finite - bandwidth signal line will transmit the modified waveform to the sample and because the large step may cause excitation of electrons to higher orbital states of the dot.@xcite however , we believe electron emission still occurs by sequential tunneling , rather than ballistically , so we can gain some insight using the tunneling model presented earlier .",
    "the tunneling model predicts that electron emission is generally pinned to the local maximum of @xmath122 in one particular awg sampling interval , so that the emission energy rises linearly as @xmath1  is made more negative , until emission from the local maximum in the preceding sampling interval becomes possible . for the large - step waveform ,",
    "a very large negative shift in @xmath1  is required to shift emission from the local maximum at the top of the large step to the local maximum of the previous sampling interval .",
    "therefore emission is pinned to the top of the large step for a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "the total voltage @xmath123 at the top of the large step increases linearly with increasingly negative @xmath1 , pushing up the emission energy .",
    "however , this effect seems to saturate , shown by the longest diagonal line features in fig .  [",
    "fig : wfm110](a ) becoming curved for the most negative @xmath1 , perhaps because the emission rate becomes fast enough for emission on the riser of the large step , before the local maximum .",
    "figure  [ fig : wfm110](a ) shows that with the modified pumping waveform it is possible for the energy gap @xmath124 to be reduced and even reversed .",
    "once again , we use the square - wave detector modulation to reveal the details of the two - electron arrival - time difference and energy gap , with the results shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : wfm110](b)-(d ) for three values of @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfm110](b ) , both electrons are emitted after the large step in the pumping waveform so the situation is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoelectron](c ) , with the electrons emitted four sampling intervals apart , and @xmath125 mev . as we make @xmath1  more negative , emission of electron",
    "a is pushed to earlier sampling intervals but emission of electron b stays fixed on the large step , with a consequent increase in @xmath126 .",
    "this makes it possible for the two electrons to be emitted with equal energies only @xmath127  ps apart [ fig .",
    "[ fig : wfm110](c ) ] , or for the two electrons to be emitted in the same sampling interval ( time gap @xmath128  ps ) with reversed energy gap @xmath129 mev [ fig .",
    "[ fig : wfm110](d ) ]",
    ". figures [ fig : wfm110](e)-(g ) show the approximate emission points for the two electrons , based on the emission times from fig .",
    "[ fig : wfm110](b)-(d ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the potential of this technique to control the two - electron wave packet .",
    "in conclusion , we have measured the arrival - time and energy distributions of single electrons and pairs of electrons emitted from a semiconductor electron pump , with sufficient time - resolution to determine an upper bound of 30  ps fwhm for the width of the single - electron arrival - time distribution .",
    "our measurement technique has the potential for even further improvement in time - resolution , by increasing the rate of the detector modulation and by reducing cross - talk between the pump and the detector .",
    "we have shown how the details of the waveform used to drive the electron pump affect the electron emission , in agreement with a tunneling model of the emission process .",
    "this enables manipulation of the electron time and energy distributions , which was demonstrated using the example of controlling the time difference and energy gap between a pair of electrons .",
    "measurement and control of the two - electron time and energy gap could be particularly useful when combined with measurements of the electron partitioning noise,@xcite for studying the factors that determine the degree of correlation within the emitted electron pairs .",
    "our results highlight the potential of the semiconductor electron pump as an on - demand emitter of single electrons and pairs of electrons , with fine control of the emission time , energy and wave packet shape .",
