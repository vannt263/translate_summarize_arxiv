    "the babar , belle , cleo , d0 , cdf and focus collaborations have discovered ( or confirmed ) a large number of charmonium - like states @xcite , and revitalized the interest in the spectroscopy of the charmonium states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 decaying into @xmath8 and the @xmath9 decaying into @xmath10 have been tentatively identified as candidates for the missing charmonium states @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the @xmath13 decaying into @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the @xmath16 , @xmath17 decaying into @xmath14 , the @xmath18 decaying into @xmath19 , the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 decaying into @xmath23 have odd properties comparing with the expectations of the charmonium models @xcite .",
    "many possible assignments for those states have been suggested , such as multiquark states ( whether the molecular type @xcite or the diquark - antidiquark type @xcite ) , hybrid states @xcite , charmonium states modified by nearby thresholds @xcite , threshold cusps @xcite , etc .",
    "the observed decay channels are @xmath24 or @xmath25 , an essential ingredient for understanding the structures of those mesons is whether or not the @xmath26 comes from a resonance state .",
    "for example , there is an indication that the @xmath22 has a well defined intermediate state in the @xmath26 invariant mass distribution , which is consistent with the scalar meson @xmath27 @xcite , the @xmath22 can be taken as a @xmath28 bound state @xcite ; though other interpretations such as a baryonium state @xcite or a canonical @xmath29 @xmath30 state @xcite are not excluded .",
    "the @xmath31 observed in the @xmath32 decay mode is the most interesting subject @xcite .",
    "it ca nt be a pure @xmath30 state due to the positive charge .",
    "there are many theoretical interpretations for its structures , such as the hadro - charmonium resonance @xcite , the molecular @xmath33 state @xcite , the tetraquark state @xcite , the cusp in the @xmath34 channel @xcite , the radially excited state of the @xmath35 @xcite , etc .",
    "we can distinguish the multiquark states from the hybrids or charmonia with the criterion of non - zero charge .",
    "recently the belle collaboration reported the first observation of two resonance - like structures ( thereafter we will denote them as @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively ) in the @xmath36 invariant mass distribution near @xmath37 in the exclusive @xmath38 decays @xcite .",
    "their quark contents must be some special combinations of the @xmath39 , just like the @xmath31 , they can not be the conventional mesons . the breit - wigner masses and widths are about @xmath40 , @xmath41@xmath42 , @xmath43@xmath44 and @xmath45@xmath46 .",
    "the significance of each of the @xmath36 structures exceeds @xmath47 , including the effects of systematics from various fit models .",
    "the @xmath6 ( denote the @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) lie about @xmath48 above the @xmath36 threshold , the decay @xmath49 can take place with the `` fall - apart '' mechanism and it is ozi super - allowed , which can take into account the large width naturally .",
    "the spins of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not determined yet , they can be scalar or vector states @xcite .    if they are scalar mesons , the decays @xmath50 occur through the relative @xmath51-wave with the phenomenological lagrangian @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "if they are vector mesons , the decays occur through the relative @xmath53-wave with the phenomenological lagrangian @xmath54 .",
    "the typical decay mode @xmath55 is kinematically allowed , and the width may be comparable with the corresponding ones of the decay mode @xmath56 , we can determine the spins of the @xmath6 with the angular distributions of the final states @xmath57 .",
    "if the decays @xmath55 are not observed ( or the widths are rather narrow ) , the @xmath6 may be hadro - charmonium resonances @xcite , i.e. bound states of a relatively compact charmonium ( @xmath58 ) inside a light hadron ( @xmath59 ) having a larger spatial size , the decays @xmath60 occur with the `` fall - apart '' mechanism ; the decays @xmath55 take place through the final - state re - scattering effects , @xmath61 , the widths may be very narrow .",
    "the masses of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 are about @xmath64 , the @xmath6 may also be @xmath51-wave @xmath65 molecular states with the spin - parity @xmath66 , as the additional contribution from the relative @xmath51-wave is about @xmath67 in the potential quark models , the decays @xmath68 occur through `` fall - apart '' mechanism and have much larger widths than the corresponding decays @xmath69 , which occur through final - state re - scattering effects",
    ". one may also think that they are @xmath34 ( or @xmath70 ) molecular states , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the bound energy is about @xmath74 , which may be beyond capacity of the one-@xmath75 and one-@xmath76 exchange .    the mass is a fundamental parameter in describing a hadron , in order to identify the @xmath4 and @xmath5 as tetraquark states , we must prove that the masses of the corresponding tetraquark states lie in the region @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , whether or not there exist such hidden tetraquark configurations is of great importance itself , because it provides a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of low energy qcd .    in this article",
    ", we assume that the hidden charmed mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 are vector tetraquark states , which consist of a pseudoscalar ( scalar ) diquark and an axial - vector ( vector ) antidiquark , and study their masses with the qcd sum rules @xcite . as their spins are not determined yet , they may also be scalar hidden charmed tetraquark states , we study this possibility with the qcd sum rules @xcite .    in the qcd sum rules ,",
    "operator product expansion is used to expand the time - ordered currents into a series of quark and gluon condensates which parameterize the long distance properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "based on current - hadron duality , we can obtain copious information about the hadronic parameters at the phenomenological side .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the qcd sum rules approach , as the mass gap between them is very small .",
    "the mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 lie in the region @xmath78 , we study whether or not there exist @xmath66 hidden charmed tetraquark states @xmath6 in this energy region and possible tetraquark identification of the mesons @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution amplitude can also be represented by a single breit - wigner mass formula , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules for the masses and pole residues of the @xmath6 in section 2 ; in section 3 , numerical results and discussions ; section 4 is reserved for conclusion .",
    "in the following , we write down the two - point correlation functions @xmath81 ( denote @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) in the qcd sum rules , @xmath84 we choose the vector currents @xmath85 ( @xmath86 type ) and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 type ) to interpolate the tetraquark states @xmath6 , the @xmath89 is the pole residue and the @xmath90 is the polarization vector .",
    "if there exist vector tetraquark states @xmath6 in the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution , it is convenient to construct the tetraquark currents with the pseudoscalar ( scalar ) diquark and axial - vector ( vector ) antidiquark , as the mesons @xmath75 and @xmath58 have the spin - parity @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively , the decays @xmath93 can occur through relative @xmath53-wave .",
    "we can also interpolate the vector tetraquark states with the currents @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 which consist of a pseudoscalar ( scalar ) antidiquark and an axial - vector ( vector ) diquark .",
    "our analytical results indicate that the current @xmath85 ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) lead to the same expression .",
    "the special superpositions @xmath97 and @xmath98 can not improve the predictions remarkably , where @xmath99 .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath81 can be decomposed as follows , @xmath100 due to lorentz covariance . the invariant functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 stand for the contributions from the vector and scalar mesons , respectively . in this article , we choose the tensor structure @xmath103 to study the masses of the vector mesons .",
    "basing on the quark - hadron duality @xcite , we can insert a complete series of intermediate states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators @xmath85 and @xmath87 into the correlation functions @xmath81 to obtain the hadronic representation . after isolating the ground state contribution from the pole terms of the @xmath6",

    "we carry out operator product expansion to the vacuum condensates adding up to dimension-6 . in calculation",
    ", we take assumption of vacuum saturation for high dimension vacuum condensates , they are always factorized to lower condensates with vacuum saturation in the qcd sum rules , factorization works well in large @xmath126 limit . in this article",
    ", we take into account the contributions from the quark condensates , mixed condensates , and neglect the contributions from the gluon condensate . in calculation , we observe the contributions from the gluon condensate are suppressed by large denominators and would not play any significant roles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the terms proportional to the @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) , their contributions are of minor importance and can be neglected safely .    differentiating the eq.(13 ) with respect to @xmath129 , then eliminate the pole residue @xmath130 , we can obtain two sum rules for the masses of the @xmath6 , @xmath131",
    "the @xmath116-quark mass appearing in the perturbative terms ( see e.g. eq.(14 ) ) is usually taken to be the pole mass in the qcd sum rules , while the choice of the @xmath132 in the leading - order coefficients of the higher - dimensional terms is arbitrary @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to take the pole mass @xmath133 @xcite .",

    "the energy scale is taken as @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 @xcite .    in the conventional qcd sum rules",

    "the present experimental knowledge about the phenomenological hadronic spectral densities of the tetraquark states is rather vague , whether or not there exist tetraquark states is not confirmed with confidence , and no knowledge about the high resonances ; we can borrow some ideas from the baryon spectra @xcite .",
    "for the octet baryons with the quantum numbers @xmath152 , the mass of the proton ( the ground state ) is @xmath153 , and the mass of the first radial excited state @xmath154 ( the roper resonance ) is @xmath155 @xcite . for the decuplet baryons with the quantum numbers @xmath156 , the mass of the @xmath157 ( the ground state ) is @xmath158 , and the mass of the first radial excited state @xmath159 is @xmath160 @xcite .",

    "it is not an indication that non - existence of the vector hidden charmed tetraquark states below @xmath163 ; in other words , the qcd sum rules alone can not indicate ( non- ) existence of the multiquark states strictly .",
    "if the multiquark states exist indeed , we can release the criterion of pole dominance and take a more phenomenological analysis with the qcd sum rules .",
    "one may refuse the value extracted from continuum dominating qcd sum rules as quantitatively reliable if one insists on that the contribution from the pole term should be larger than ( or about ) @xmath164 ( for detailed discussions about this subject , one can consult ref.@xcite ) . in the present case ,",
    "the numerical results indicate that the threshold parameter @xmath165 can lead to possible borel window , we take the value @xmath166 .    with the central values of the input parameters ,",
    "the contribution of the condensate ( of the largest dimension ) @xmath167 is less than @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) at the value @xmath170 , and the contribution decreases quickly to about @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) at the value @xmath173 for the @xmath86 ( @xmath88 ) type interpolating current . in this article",
    ", the borel parameter can be taken as @xmath174 , we expect the operator product expansion is convergent .",

    "if we take into account the uncertainty of the threshold parameter , @xmath180 , the pole contribution is about @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "the borel parameter can be taken as @xmath183 , where two criteria of the qcd sum rules are full filled @xcite . from the figs.1 - 2",
    ", we can see that the sum rules are not stable enough below the value @xmath184 .",
    "in the article , the borel parameter and the threshold parameter are taken as @xmath185 and @xmath180 , respectively .",
    "for the tetraquark states consist of light flavors , if the perturbative terms have the main contribution ( in the conventional qcd sum rules , the perturbative terms are always have the main contribution ) , we can approximate the spectral density with the perturbative term ( where the @xmath186 are some numerical coefficients ) @xcite , @xmath187 take the pole dominance condition , @xmath188 and obtain the approximated relation , @xmath189 the superpositions of different interpolating currents can only change the contributions from different terms in the operator product expansion , and improve convergence , they can not change the leading behavior of the spectral density @xmath190 of the perturbative term @xcite .",
    "this relation is difficult to satisfy for the light flavor tetraquark states @xcite , however , it is not an indication that non - existence of the tetraquark states .",

    "the authors take the @xmath13 as hidden charmed tetraquark state and calculate its mass with the qcd sum rules , the borel parameter and threshold parameter are taken as @xmath192 and @xmath193 ; in ref.@xcite , the authors take the @xmath194 as hidden charmed molecular state and calculate its mass with @xmath195 and @xmath196 . in those sum rules , the relation in eq.(18 ) can be well satisfied .    in this article , @xmath197 , the relation in eq.(18 )",
    "is certainly satisfied .",
    "the relation can serve as an additional constraint in choosing the borel parameter and threshold parameter , it alone can not lead to satisfactory results , as a number of values of the borel parameter and threshold parameter satisfy the relation .    taking into account all uncertainties of the input parameters ,",
    "finally we obtain the values of the masses and pole residues of the @xmath6 , which are shown in figs.(1 - 2 ) , @xmath198 for the @xmath86 type and @xmath88 type interpolating currents respectively . in numerical calculations ,",
    "we observe the uncertainties come from the parameter @xmath199 are very small , while the uncertainties come from the parameters @xmath132 , @xmath200 and @xmath118 are comparable with each other .    if we take larger uncertainty for the pole mass , @xmath201 , the values of the mass change to @xmath202 and @xmath203 respectively . furthermore , we vary the energy scale from @xmath204 to @xmath205 , the central value of the mass @xmath206 changes slowly , less than @xmath207 .",
    "the value @xmath208 happens to be the energy gap between the ground states and first radial excited states of the light baryons @xcite , the threshold parameter @xmath180 makes sense .    at the energy scale @xmath209 , @xmath210 @xcite ,",
    "if the perturbative @xmath211 corrections to the perturbative term are companied with large numerical factors , @xmath212 , for example , @xmath213 , the contributions may be large .",
    "we can make a crude estimation by multiplying the perturbative term with a numerical factor , say @xmath214 , the mass @xmath206 decreases slightly , about @xmath215 , the pole residue changes remarkably .",
