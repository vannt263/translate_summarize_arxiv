    "in this supplementary material , we provide details of the stabilizer calculation for the von neumann entropy for various regions in the presence of twists",
    ". we will pay particular attention to the simplest case of the entropy of a simply connected region enclosing a twist , the other cases involve simple modifications of this argument . as noted in the main text",
    "the calculation applies the general methods of  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the stabiliser formalism for describing quantum states , for more details on this we refer the reader to  @xcite and references therein .",
    "consider a simply connected region of the vacuum state of a toric code enclosing one twist .",

    ", we must identify a generating set of stabilizers for a vacuum state in the canonical form .          with a partition @xmath63 ( shown in red ) .",
    "although there can exist stabilizers that take the form of dyon strings terminating at the twist , we can multiply by local stabilizers to deform such strings such that they have no support on @xmath19 .",
    "these deformed strings are indicated in figure 3 of the main text .",
    "thus , a complete set of stabilizer generators that cross the partition @xmath63 is given by the plaquette operators @xmath81 for @xmath82 , above .",
    "for example , the plaquette operator corresponding to @xmath83 is :              the @xmath81 operators are not in canonical form , as each @xmath84 anti - commutes with both @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in our example , @xmath85 anti - commutes with the following two operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 given by :      to achieve canonical form , we will replace one of the stabilizer generators on the boundary with a stabilizer generator confined to @xmath55 , as follows .",
    "first , consider the product of all the stabilizer generators @xmath90 that lie on the boundary .",
    "in our example , @xmath91 takes the form :        notice that @xmath91 commutes with all operators @xmath84 .",
    "also , consider the product @xmath92 of all stabilizer generators contained entirely in @xmath19 . in our example",
    ", this product @xmath93 takes the form              ( note that , in the untwisted toric code , one can construct two such operators using the natural partition of toric code stabilizers into two commuting subsets . with the presence of a twist",
    ", however , there is only a single such operator . )",
    "we will now modify our set of stabilizer generators , by removing one of the generators on the boundary ( to be specific , say @xmath94 ) and replacing it with the product of @xmath91 and @xmath93 .",
    "it should be clear from the preceding argument that this replacement is possible because @xmath94 can be expressed as a product of our new stabilizer generator and the generators in @xmath19 and @xmath63 .",
    "we now will modify the stabilizer generators on the boundary into a new set @xmath95 that has canonical form , as follows .",
    "we retain the stabilizer generators @xmath96 for integer @xmath97 . for these stabilizers , the operators @xmath98 obtained by restricting @xmath99 to region @xmath19 take a form as shown below for the particular example of @xmath100 :        we replace @xmath101 with the product @xmath102 .",

    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we also needed to calculate von neumann entropies for annular regions abc with twists outside the annulus as indicated in figure 4 of the main paper .",
    "this means that the boundary of the region of interest abc is now composed of two disjoint pieces .",
    "however the modifications of the argument above are nontrivial only in the case indicated in figure 4c of the main paper where the lattice is prepared in an eigenstate of the logical-@xmath77 operator @xmath78 .",
    "this is analogous to the ising anyon model where one @xmath13-type anyon on region @xmath32 and one @xmath13-type anyon on region @xmath33 will fuse to give one fusion outcome with certainty .",
    "however , fusing the two particles on region @xmath32 can produce the vacuum @xmath10 or a fermion @xmath14 with equal probability @xmath79 .",
    "the details of the tee calculation are more involved in this case , as the operator @xmath78 can not be deformed away from region @xmath41 .",
    "we therefore require a different method to find a canonical form for region @xmath41 . denoting the two connected segments of the boundary by @xmath112 , for @xmath113 , we rewrite the indices of the plaquettes that cut these boundaries as @xmath114 , with @xmath115 numbering the generators around the boundary as before .",
    "we deform @xmath78 such that it only has common support with the generators @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 on the boundaries . to achieve canonical form ,",
    "we replace the generators @xmath120 such that their local support commutes with the local support all the other generators .",
