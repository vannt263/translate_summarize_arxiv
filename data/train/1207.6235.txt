    "as the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe , clusters of galaxies harbour copious amounts of both luminous and dark matter . located at the densest regions of the cosmic web @xcite , clusters grow through semi - continuous accretion of matter along large - scale filaments as well as through discrete mergers with nearby clusters .",

    "the latter include a simple , yet powerful diagnostic that can be used to investigate the nature and properties of dark matter , namely the spatial separation of collisional and non - collisional cluster components during cluster mergers .",
    "if dark matter is indeed collisionless ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cluster mergers should result in a clear segregation between the collisionless dark matter and the viscous intra - cluster medium ( icm ) which is subject to shock heating and compression .",

    "[ a1_spec ] with identified lines labeled .",
    "strong emission lines in both the blue and red side of the spectrum allow an unambiguous redshift measurement of @xmath82 , placing this object well in the background of macsj0140.00555  and confirming its nature as a gravitational arc . the broad line profiles and the unresolved",
    ", variable x - ray emission suggest that a1 is a seyfert i active galactic nucleus .    in the x - ray regime ,",
    "a1 coincides with a highly time - variable point source .",
    "we measure 0.36  kev fluxes of @xmath83 from the first _",
    "chandra _ observation in 2004 ( too little for the source to be visible in fig .",
    "[ intro_source ] ) , and @xmath84 from the second one in 2010 .",
    "however , the implied variability of at least a factor of 4 ( but conceivably much more ) over a time of several years still needs to be adjusted by the gravitational amplification by the cluster at the location of the arc . our mass model ( see below )",
    "estimates this magnification factor to be about @xmath85 which reduces the variability to a modest level commonly observed in agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "strong - lensing constraints are provided by the location , geometry , and orientation of a1 , all of which identify it as a highly magnified tangential arc , either very close to or crossing the critical line .",
    "we attempt to reproduce the observed constraints using a series of parametric models created with the _ lenstool _ software @xcite .    in our model of the mass distribution , we include both smooth cluster - scale components as well as galaxy - scale components . for the latter , each cluster galaxy",
    "is assigned a small - scale isothermal elliptical halo scaled according to its luminosity ( see @xcite for more details on the modeling process ) . for the cluster scale mass haloes , we assume either one pseudo - isothermal component centered on the north - western bcg , or two components centered on either bcg . although we can not precisely constrain the mass ratio between the main and the secondary cluster - scale components , we find that the large radius of curvature of a1 is better reproduced by models with two haloes , with the second , south - eastern halo containing up to 50% of the total mass of the main halo .",
    "the geometry of the critical lines ( fig .",
    "[ hst ] ) is also compatible with other strong - lensing features in macsj0140.00555 , found to be single images of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath86 .",
    "while these simple models provide no tight constraint on the mass of the south - eastern cluster component , they yield a robust measurement of the mass of the north - western main cluster .",
    "we find @xmath87 m@xmath8 for the projected mass out to the radial distance marked by the location of a1 .",
    "this value is free of systematic uncertainties as long as the mass distribution of the north - western cluster is centred on the location of bcg1 within 1 , an assumption that is supported by strong - lensing analyses of many other clusters @xcite .",
    "in the following we attempt to address three questions : a ) what is the inclination of the merger axis relative to the plane of the sky , and can we constrain the impact parameter of the collision , b ) what is the likely total mass of macsj0140.00555  and where does the system fall on the scaling relations regarding mass , x - ray temperature , and x - ray luminosity , and c ) can this cluster be used to tighten the existing constraints on the self - interaction cross section of dark matter ?",
    "our analysis of the imaging and spectroscopic evidence at both optical and x - ray wavelengths confirms our original hypothesis that macsj0140.00555  is an active merger of two sub - clusters .",
    "a single emission peak is observed in the x - ray regime , located between the two bcgs , and no evidence of a surviving cool core is apparent in either the x - ray surface brightness or the icm temperature maps .",
    "the presence of a gravitational arc with a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath88 yields strong - lensing constraints on the mass distribution that favour a two - component mass model .",
    "the relative masses of the two subclusters are , however , poorly constrained but likely to fall in the range of 1:4 to 1:2 .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts of 66 cluster members show no evidence of a bimodal distribution indicative of a line - of - sight merger and also no obvious correlation between radial velocity and position on the sky .",
    "our tentative conclusion that the merger axis lies close to the plane of the sky will be examined more closely in the remainder of this section .",
    "we first note that the relative radial velocity of the two bcgs of @xmath4 is very small compared to the terminal velocity of bcgs in massive clusters undergoing a head - on collision .",
    "@xcite estimate the merger velocity for the bullet cluster to be @xmath89 by calculating the free - fall velocity onto a mass concentration described by a king profile with @xmath90 and @xmath91 kpc .",
    "@xcite estimate a merger velocity of @xmath92 for macsj0025.41222 by scaling the results of @xcite to match the velocity dispersion and mass of their target cluster . in either case , the merger velocity is clearly supersonic . ]",
    "owing to the deep gravitational potential well .",
    "since the x - ray gas mass of macsj0140.00555  is comparable to that of macsj0025.41222 , and the total masses of the two systems are also comparable ( discussed below ) , we can expect the merger velocity of macsj0140.00555  to be the order of a few 1000 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the observed small relative radial velocity of the two bcgs may be explained by any of the following three scenarios : ( 1 ) the two clusters are approaching each other along an axis almost aligned with our line of sight but are still so far apart that the hubble expansion essentially cancels out the aforementioned free - fall velocity ; ( 2 ) the two clusters are colliding along an axis almost aligned with the plane of the sky such that the observed difference in radial velocity represents only a small fraction of their relative velocity in three dimensions ; ( 3 ) the two clusters are observed near turnaround after the primary collision and are close to at rest with respect to each other  in this final scenario , the orientation of the merger axis is barely constrained at all .",
    "of these three scenarios , we can firmly rule out the first one , since the required separation of several mpc would render the system a pre - merger . prior to first contact , however , the gaseous cores of the two clusters should align well with their bcgs which is in conflict with the observed x - ray / optical morphology shown in fig .  1 .",
    "distinguishing between scenarios 2 and 3 is much more difficult based on the data at hand . assuming that turnaround after the primary collision occurs approximately at the virial radius ( @xmath93 ) , the observed separation of the bcgs in the plane of the sky of about 250 kpc implies an inclination of the merger axis of less than 82@xmath94 under scenario 3  a very weak constraint indeed .",
    "scenario 2 ( the one adopted by @xcite for macsj0025.41222 ) is appealing mainly because of its simplicity ; however , absent all signs of shocks in the x - ray data it is not strongly favoured by the observational evidence .",
    "although any conclusions regarding the impact parameter of the collision must necessarily remain somewhat speculative too , three pieces of observational evidence support the classification of macsj0140.00555  as a post - collision , binary , head - on merger by @xcite : ( 1 ) the excellent alignment of the x - ray emission with the line connecting the bcgs of the two subclusters ; ( 2 ) the elongation of the x - ray contours along the merger axis suggested by that same line ; and ( 3 ) the absence of two x - ray peaks that could be associated with the cores of the individual subclusters and the position of the single x - ray peak between the bcgs .    to summarize , we conclude that macsj0140.00555  is a binary merger proceeding at close to zero impact parameter . in view of the absence of clear signs of a very recent collision ( be it in the form of shocks , surviving cluster cores , or pronounced disturbance in the icm ) , we propose that macsj0140.00555  is observed well after the primary collision and quite possibly after turnaround . in this scenario the inclination of the merger axis with respect to the plane of the sky can not be constrained beyond stating that it is likely to be less than approximately @xmath95 .      the estimate of the total mass of @xmath96 m@xmath8 , combined with the global gas temperature of @xmath56kev and a 0.12.4kev luminosity of @xmath62 of @xmath64 ( see section  [ sec : global_properties ] ) places macsj0140.00555  within the scattering of the luminosity  mass and temperature  mass scaling relations @xcite .      although the lack of deep _ hst _ imaging prevents us from measuring the mass distribution in macsj0140.00555  using weak - lensing techniques , the estimates derived from the measured gas mass and from the simple strong - lensing mass model ( sections  [ sec : global_properties ] and [ sec : lens_model ] ) strongly suggest total masses for the two subclusters that are comparable to those of macsj0025.41222 of @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "macsj0140.00555  thus has the potential to provide independent constraints on the dark matter self - interaction cross section .",
    "our joint x - ray / optical analysis of macsj0140.00555  based on observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ hst _ finds a velocity dispersion of @xmath98 ( @xmath3 ) as well as @xmath99 , k@xmath100 kev , and @xmath101 m@xmath8 . while the system s x - ray /",
    "optical morphology clearly identifies macsj0140.00555  as a post - collision merger , there remains little observational evidence of the collision in the form of shock fronts , temperature gradients , or a bimodal redshift distribution of the cluster galaxies .",
    "we conclude that macsj0140.00555  is a well advanced merger . although all observational evidence is consistent with the merger proceeding at minimal impact parameter and close to the plane of the sky , we are unable to formally constrain the inclination of the merger axis with respect to the plane of the sky , due to the inherent degeneracy between ( radial ) peculiar velocity and hubble flow .",
    "heuristic arguments , however , suggest that macsj0140.00555  is a head - on , binary merger along an only mildly inclined axis , observed well after the primary collision and possibly after turnaround of the merger components .",
    "our strong - lensing analysis of the system confirms the presence of two well separated mass distributions , making macsj0140.00555  a potential candidate for a measurement of @xmath15 , the self - interaction cross section of dark matter .",

    "<S> these values are in good agreement with our x - ray mass estimates which yield a total mass of macsj0140.00555  of @xmath10 m@xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> although all optical and x - ray properties of macsj0140.00555  are consistent with a well advanced head - on merger proceeding along an axis close to the plane of the sky , the degeneracy between hubble flow and peculiar velocity prevents us from obtaining a quantitative constraint on the inclination angle of the merger axis . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of pronounced substructure in the cluster gas distribution and the proximity of the two optical cluster cores both in projection and in radial velocity suggests that the merger is observed well after the primary collision and , possibly , after turnaround . </S>",
    "<S> a weak - lensing analysis of the mass distribution in macsj0140.00555  has the potential of yielding constraints on the self - interaction cross section of dark matter similar to those obtained for macsj0025.4@xmath111222 , although the smaller projected separation of the two cluster components makes the measurement more challenging .    </S>",
