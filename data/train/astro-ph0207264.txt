    "diffuse interstellar gas clouds are heated by the absorption of starlight and cooled by the emission of spectral line radiation at far  infrared ( fir ) and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "energy can be transferred from the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) to the gas by the photoelectric effect on dust grains @xcite , whereby far ultraviolet ( fuv ) ( 6ev @xmath6 13.6ev ) photons ionize grains and the ejected electrons heat the gas through collisions . in diffuse h  i  regions of low kinetic temperature ( @xmath7 ) , the `` cold neutral medium '' ( cnm ) ,",
    "this process is thought to be the dominant gas heating mechanism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the most abundant form of carbon gas in the cnm is the singly - ionized carbon atom , c  ii , because the first ionization potential of carbon is 11.3ev and the cnm is permeated by fuv photons .",
    "the 158  ( ) emission line transition of [ c  ii ] should be the primary coolant of the cnm @xcite .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "first , the c  ii  ion is relatively easy to excite by collisions given average cnm temperatures ( @xmath8;@xcite ) .",
    "after the hyperfine states of hydrogen , the @xmath9 fine structure state of c  ii  is the first excited state ( @xmath10 ) of all gas - phase cnm constituents ( the next state is the @xmath11 level of the o  i  atom , which is 228@xmath12  above ground ) .",
    "second , once excited , the energy loss rate , given by the product @xmath13 $ ] , is much higher for c  ii  than for other cnm species . here",
    "@xmath14 is the einstein spontaneous emission coefficient for the  transition and @xmath15 $ ] is the column density of c  ii  in the excited state .",
    "since the fuv radiation field that ionizes dust grains ( and thus heats the gas ) can also heat the grains , one expects a connection between the [ c  ii ] 158  line emission from photoelectron - heated gas and the far - infrared ( fir ) emission from fuv - heated dust grains .",
    "large - scale surveys of the galaxy indeed reveal a link between the c  ii  and fir emission properties of the cnm .",
    "an unbiased survey of spectral line and continuum emission in the milky way was conducted with two instruments on board the cosmic background explorer ( _ cobe _ ) satellite : the far infrared absolute spectrometer ( firas ) and the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) .",
    "the [ c  ii ] emission was observed with firas to be closely correlated with h  i  emission at high galactic latitudes , with an average c  ii  cooling rate of @xmath16ergs@xmath17(h  atom)@xmath18 @xcite . both dirbe and firas maps of",
    "the dust continuum show that the dust opacity and fir surface brightness are also correlated with h  i  column density at high latitude @xcite .",
    "so on the large scale ( firas has an angular resolution of 7 , dirbe of 40 ) , cnm h  i  gas has constant fir _ and _ [ c  ii ] emissivity .",
    "it is therefore likely that the processing of fuv radiation by dust grains ( 1 ) to produce fir dust emission and ( 2 ) to heat the gas  resulting in [ c  ii ] emission  occurs in similar ways throughout the cold interstellar medium .",
    "it is difficult to test this idea directly using the _ cobe _ data , mainly because of inadequate resolution . the emission from gas with vastly different physical conditions , for example molecular and atomic gas , might be combined together in a single firas or dirbe measurement , making it impossible to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed emission .",
    "high resolution observations of the [ c  ii ] and fir emission from translucent molecular clouds can be used to test the limits of models for gas heating by the isrf .",
    "molecular gas can only exist in shielded locales where the fuv portion of the isrf has been attenuated , and thus where the photoelectric heating is much weaker than in atomic regions . in these regions ,",
    "most of the carbon has combined into co , and most of the [ c  ii ] emission has `` turned off . ''",
    "although fuv radiation is weak in molecular zones , optical photons are still present to heat dust grains and produce fir emission . indeed ,",
    "cirrus clouds @xcite first detected in fir emission at 60 and 100  are associated with intermediate - extinction molecular clouds , or translucent clouds @xcite .",
    "translucent molecular clouds are most easily observed when nearby and at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "currently over 100 nearby ( @xmath20pc ) translucent high  latitude clouds ( hlcs ) , have been cataloged using their co emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in a study of 75 hlcs , it was shown that all of the clouds are associated with h  i , and that the hlcs probably condensed out of diffuse cnm gas @xcite .",
    "we examine here the [ c  ii ] and fir emission towards a sample of translucent hlcs using the _ iso _ satellite .",
    "since the mean angular size of hlcs in co emission maps is @xmath21 @xcite , the clouds are easily resolved by the @xmath22 beam of _ iso_.",
    "this allows us to choose between lines of sight towards individual clouds with varying amounts of atomic and molecular gas , which was not possible with _ cobe_. as described above , the lines of sight dominated by molecular gas include regions from which fuv photons are excluded .    in this paper",
    "we summarize the _ iso _ observations of [ c  ii ] emission towards hlcs , all of which are available from the _ iso _ archive (  2 ) .",
    "we discover that hlcs fall into two categories based on their 60/100  color , `` cold '' sources and `` warm '' sources .",
    "we find that the line - of - sight [ c  ii ] emissivity is consistent with the average high  latitude _ cobe _ cloud emission for both cold and warm positions .",
    "we surmise that the chief distinction between the two 60/100 color regimes is the column density (  3 ) . assuming that the local heating and cooling depend only on the fixed properties of dust grains and the attenuated isrf intensity",
    ", we develop a model for the [ c  ii ] and fir emission of translucent clouds .",
    "the model enables us to estimate the average line of sight photoelectric heating efficiency , @xmath5 , as well as the intensity of the interstellar radiation field incident on hlcs , @xmath4 (  4 ) .",
    "we discuss the significance of our results , and point out some issues unresolved by this study (  5 ) .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions (  6 ) .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) @xcite , a satellite observatory built by the european space agency ( esa ) , was launched in 1995 november and operated until its cryogenic reserves were depleted in 1998 april .",
    "a total of seven peer - reviewed observing programs dedicated to studying [ c  ii ] emission from nine translucent high  latitude molecular clouds were carried out with the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) @xcite on board _",
    "iso_. some of these [ c  ii ] measurements were the results of proposals by us ( observer : proposal = tbania : tmb_1 , tbania : tmb_2 , tbania : sh_hlc , and wreach : phase ) , and the rest were extracted from the _ iso _ public data archive .",
    "the tbania data were originally published in @xcite .",
    "the data for twenty of the positions observed towards cloud mbm-12 ( l1457 ) were reported previously by @xcite .",
    "table 1 lists the nine hlcs observed in [ c  ii ] with _ iso _ , together with their positions in galactic coordinates ( @xmath23 ) ( columns 2 and 3 ) .",
    "each entry in the table represents a separate source `` observation , '' i.e. ,  a self - contained set of measurements of the target .",
    "a given observation may consist of a single point , or it may consist of multiple pointings of the telescope as part of a raster map . for clouds with @xmath24 ( all clouds in our sample but g300.116.6 ) we use the cloud names given in the @xcite catalog , and list commonly used alternate names in parenthesis ( column 1 of table 1 ) .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of each observation ( column 4 ) is defined by the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) beam size of the _ iso _ lws instrument as well as the total extent of the raster grid employed .",
    "we indicate the position angle ( pa ) of raster grids , measured counterclockwise from celestial north , in column 5 .",
    "emission spectra of [ c  ii ] were measured with the lws spectrometer in either lws01 or lws02 scanned grating modes .",
    "rapid scanning was used , and each spectral resolution element ( of width @xmath25 ) was sampled many times .",
    "this ensured that cosmic ray hits on the detector were efficiently diagnosed and removed .",
    "we used detector lw4 , centered on 161@xmath26 m , to measure the 157.7  ( ) transition of [ c  ii ] .",
    "this detector is estimated to have a nearly circular beam , with fwhm size @xmath22 @xcite , 20% smaller than predicted by early optical models .",
    "the truncation of the lws beam is attributed to multiple clipping effects and stray light propagation within the optical system @xcite . stray light is also apparently the cause of interference fringes , which manifest as a sinusoidal modulation with period @xmath27 at @xmath28 in the lws spectra of extended sources @xcite .",
    "we attempted to minimize the effect of the fringes on our [ c  ii ] integrated intensities by subtracting either a linear or quadratic baseline from the spectral data measured with the lw4 detector .",
    "we derived c  ii  integrated intensities using the automatic analysis ( aa ) data products from the _ iso _ archive .",
    "all calibration steps were performed at esa in batch mode , i.e. ,  without human input . in order to check the quality of the aa procedure , we calibrated a subset of our spectra manually using the lws interactive analysis software and compared the results with the the corresponding aa results .",
    "the integrated [ c  ii ] intensities produced using the two methods were indistinguishable to within @xmath29 .",
    "as the absolute flux calibration of the lws has been estimated to be no better than @xmath30 @xcite , we judged that calibration beyond the aa stage was not necessary .",
    "we reduced the calibrated scan data using the iso spectral analysis package ( isap ) .",
    "first , we averaged all scans and scan directions for detector lw4 in bins of width 0.2  using a 3@xmath31 median clipping algorithm .",
    "then we subtracted linear or quadratic baselines from the continuum , and made gaussian fits to each spectrum .",
    "since the doppler equivalent velocity resolution of the spectra is @xmath32 , which is much larger than the typical h  i  linewidth of hlcs ( 6 - 26@xmath33 ) , we assumed that all measurements were unresolved spectrally .",
    "this allowed us to fix the fwhm linewidth in the gaussian fits to the known lws resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "we used the gaussian fits to compute the [ c  ii ] integrated flux , which we divided by the lws beam area , @xmath35sr , to obtain the [ c  ii ] integrated intensity , @xmath36 , in units of erg@xmath37 .",
    "we derived error bars in @xmath36  by adding a 20% absolute calibration uncertainty @xcite in quadrature with the formal gaussian fit errors in the [ c  ii ] line integral , obtained using the isap software .",
    "we obtained _ iras _ sky survey atlas ( issa ) images of each cloud and extracted the 60  and 100  surface brightness , @xmath38  and @xmath39  respectively , for the positions observed in [ c  ii ] . the angular resolution of the issa is only 4 , whereas the _ iso _ lws has a fwhm beamsize of 71  at 157.7 , so we interpolated the _",
    "maps onto a 71  grid before making @xmath38  and @xmath39  measurements .",
    "we have tested the validity of interpolating the 4  _ iras _ images to compare with _ iso _ data .",
    "we obtained hires - processed _ iras _ images of the clouds in our sample @xcite .",
    "the hires maps have approximately 60  and 100  resolution at 60 and 100 , respectively , which is comparable to the _ iso _ lws beamsize . a linear fit to the hires data as a function of interpolated issa surface brightness shows a strong correlation with slope=1 for pixels with issa values brighter than about half of the maximum value .",
    "below the half - maximum threshold , hires images have an average surface brightness of zero , probably the result of background subtraction in the hires process .",
    "we conclude that on average the interpolated issa images give a good approximation to the actual surface brightness at higher resolution , with the advantage of maintaining the low surface brightness emission that does not appear in hires images .",
    "the issa plates are optimized for relative , not absolute , photometry @xcite . to put images of different clouds on the same relative scale",
    ", we devised a zeropoint adjustment method that took advantage of the constant 60/100scaling properties of high  latitude clouds .",
    "pixel - by - pixel comparisons of the 60  and 100  images show a strong correlation ( the correlation coefficient is typically greater than 0.9 ) .",
    "linear fits to the @xmath39versus @xmath38  data for each of our nine clouds yield the average relationship @xmath39= @xmath40@xmath38 @xmath41 .",
    "the relative variation in the derived slopes is 0.15/5.74@xmath42 , showing that the 60/100 _ ratio _ is nearly constant for all cloud images . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative variation in the @xmath39-intercepts exceeds @xmath43 , indicating significant fluctuations in the 60  and 100  surface brightness zeropoint from image to image .",
    "we adjusted the zeropoint of each image so that @xmath39=0 when @xmath38=0 by subtracting the derived @xmath39-intercept values from each 100  cloud image .",
    "we converted the _ iras _ relative scale to the _ cobe _ dirbe absolute surface brightness scale by multiplying the 60  data by 0.87 and the 100  data by 0.72 @xcite .",
    "we derived error bars in @xmath39  by combining in quadrature the 10% accuracy in point source flux recovery @xcite , with the 7% uncertainty in the dirbe to _ iras _ conversion at 100 .",
    "we derived error bars for @xmath38  measurements by combining in quadrature the 10% accuracy in point source flux recovery with the 2.5% uncertainty in the dirbe to _ iras _ conversion at 60 .",
    "a total of 109 positions in hlcs were observed using the _ iso _ lws , and [ c  ii ] emission was detected towards 101 of them .",
    "we list the [ c  ii ] detection rate for each observation in column 6 of table 1 .",
    "@xcite showed that hlcs are the average galactic high - latitude sources of co and far - infrared emission .",
    "we demonstrate here that they are also representative sources of [ c  ii ] radiation .",
    "we mentioned in  1 that cnm h  i  emission is correlated with both far - infrared and [ c  ii ] emission .",
    "now we compare directly the @xmath44 and [ c  ii ] properties of high - latitude material using the all sky _ cobe _ surveys .",
    "the firas line emission maps give [ c  ii ] 157.7  integrated intensity at 7  spatial resolution .",
    "the dirbe zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) maps give dust continuum surface brightness in far - infrared bands at 40  resolution @xcite .",
    "we use a function introduced by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to define the far - infrared surface brightness in terms of the 60 and 100  surface brightness : @xmath45 this representation of far - infrared emission is estimated to be accurate to within 1% for modified blackbody spectra from dust clouds with temperatures between 20 and 80k and emissivity that varies as @xmath46 .",
    "we created dirbe maps of @xmath44 using the 60 and 100   zsma data , resampled to the 7  firas grid , and compared with the [ c  ii ] map ( see figure [ cii_fir_cobe ] ) .",
    "we obtain a highly significant correlation ( there is less than 0.05% chance that the data are uncorrelated ) .",
    "a linear fit weighted by the error bars for all data with @xmath47 gives @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath44 are in the same units .",
    "a grey wedge on figure [ cii_fir_cobe ] shows the @xmath50 range of expected @xmath44 and @xmath36values . since the fit was weighted by the _ cobe _ error bars , this wedge is much narrower than the actual scatter in data points ( the rms scatter in @xmath36  about the fit is @xmath51 ) .",
    "the fit gave an @xmath49-intercept of @xmath52 , because many of the firas [ c  ii ] values for low @xmath44 are negative .",
    "for what follows , we assume that in the absence of @xmath44 emission there is no [ c  ii ] emission , and ignore the intercept .",
    "we compare the [ c  ii]-@xmath44 relationship for `` cobe clouds '' with our hlc data .",
    "the c  ii  integrated intensities of the 101 hlc positions detected with _",
    "iso _ are plotted as a function of the @xmath44 surface brightness in figure [ cp_fir ] .",
    "linear regression to the data , weighted by the errors , gives @xmath53 in the fit we have fixed the @xmath36-intercept at zero to reflect our assumption that @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "we plot the fit as a solid line in figure [ cp_fir ] . a gray wedge labeled `` cobe '' represents the @xmath56 range of expected ( @xmath44 , @xmath36 ) values based on the _ cobe _ data ( equation [ cp_fir_eq ] ) .",
    "the hlc and _ cobe _ slopes are identical . _",
    "our analysis is consistent with the hlcs being part of the same population of sources as the average cnm source observed with the low - resolution _ cobe _",
    "instruments_.    there is evidence that at the _ iso _ resolution a straight line is not the best representation of the @xmath49-@xmath44 data .",
    "breaking the data into @xmath44 subregions and performing separate linear fits yields a systematic decrease in slope as @xmath44 increases .",
    "figure [ cp_fir_bins ] shows an example of this for bins of width @xmath57 along the @xmath44-axis .",
    "the local slope is close to the overall slope for @xmath58 , but is virtually zero for @xmath59 .",
    "we also plot in figure [ cp_fir_bins ] the weighted mean values of @xmath49 and @xmath44 in the bins . a significant departure from the _ cobe _ and _ iso _ predictions",
    "is seen in the bin with the largest @xmath44 integrated surface brightness , where @xmath36  is 25% lower than expected . thus , _ the [ c  ii ] emissivity of hlc gas decreases as @xmath44 increases_. in  4 we explain this using a model of the radiative heating and cooling of translucent clouds .",
    "@xcite showed that the eight hlcs they studied have typical 60/100 colors ( @xmath38/@xmath39 ) when compared to _",
    "the 60/100 colors for our nine clouds are likewise typical .",

    "is a dashed line representing the average behavior for milky way gas correlated with h  iemission , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "most positions fall slightly below this line .",
    "these sources probably contain mostly atomic gas , since their @xmath44 surface brightnesses are low and their @xmath38/@xmath39  ratios are slightly `` warmer '' than that of average h  i. for @xmath61 there is a split into two populations : the `` cold '' sources with @xmath62 ; and the `` warm '' sources with @xmath63 .",
    "warm positions generally produce less emission than cold positions  over 90% of the warm positions , but less than 30% of the cold positions , have @xmath64 .",
    "their [ c  ii ] and @xmath44 properties are not easily distinguishable otherwise .",
    "weighted linear fits to the [ c  ii ] vs. @xmath44 data , holding the intercept fixed at zero , give slopes of @xmath65 for warm sources and @xmath66 for cold sources .",
    "these slopes are equivalent within the errors to each other , and to the slope determined for the sample as a whole .",
    "the most striking difference between cold and warm positions seems to be their _",
    "column density_. figure [ mbm12_av_color ] shows this for high  latitude cloud mbm12 ( l1457 ) .",
    "here we compare the 60 and 100   images to a visual extinction map of the cloud .",
    "the extinction , @xmath67 , was derived using an adaptive grid star count algorithm @xcite from h and k images in the 2mass second incremental data release .",
    "after resampling the 60 , 100 , and @xmath67  images onto the same grid , we compared the 60/100 color with @xmath67   for each pixel .",
    "figure [ mbm12_av_color ] shows @xmath38/@xmath39  averaged in bins of width @xmath68mag .",
    "the 60/100 color decreases monotonically with increasing extinction , implying that warm dust emission is a characteristic of low extinction positions , while cold dust emission is a characteristic of high extinction positions .",
    "the effect is not slight .",
    "a small adjustment in 60/100 , e.g. ,  from 0.184 to 0.160 , represents a large change in @xmath67 , from approximately 1 to 3 .    in what follows ,",
    "we develop a model for the radiative transfer of the isrf in translucent clouds .",
    "this allows us to predict the emission from dust grains , as well as the photoelectric heating and [ c  ii ] cooling of the gas .",
    "we show that the cold / warm dichotomy in translucent clouds is probably caused by the attenuation of the isrf , not changes in dust properties .",
    "the [ c  ii ] emissivity towards translucent hlcs decreases as the @xmath44 surface brightness increases .",
    "the cold and warm populations of hlc positions , identified via their 60/100 colors , have different column densities , and hence different amounts of atomic versus molecular gas , but similar [ c  ii]-@xmath44 emission properties . to explain these empirical facts we offer a model of the heating and cooling of gas and dust in the interstellar medium .",
    "the model describes regions heated primarily by the interstellar radiation field , i.e. ,  translucent regions .",
    "we simplify the calculations by treating only the single most important sources of heating and cooling of translucent gas : the photoelectric effect for gas heating , and [ c  ii ] emission for gas cooling @xcite .",
    "we predict the @xmath44 and [ c  ii ] emission under conditions of thermal equilibrium . for the dust grains ,",
    "this requires that the power emitted by each grain equals the power absorbed from the attenuated interstellar radiation field . for the gas",
    "this requires that the local [ c  ii ] cooling rate equals the photoelectric heating rate .    by assuming that [ c  ii ] emission is tied to photoelectric heating , we bypass chemistry . we do not attempt to determine the _ abundance _ of c  ii  gas in the [ c  ii]-emitting regions , e.g. ,  by balancing the production and destruction of c  ii  using a chemical model .",
    "instead we determine the photoelectric heating , which depends on the dust properties , and equate it with the [ c  ii ] cooling modified by an efficiency parameter ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "this approximation assumes that ( 1 ) most [ c  ii ] cooling takes place in fuv - heated areas and ( 2 ) most fuv heating takes place in areas cooled by [ c  ii ] emission .",
    "if c  ii  were abundant in regions not heated by the photoelectric effect , then much of the [ c  ii ] emission might be the result of another heating mechanism , such as cosmic rays , and we would underestimate @xmath36 .",
    "this is unlikely .",
    "if the radiation field is too weak to ionize dust grains ( average work function : 5.5@xmath69 ) , it is also too weak to ionize c  i  ( ionization potential : 11.3@xmath69 ) and form c  ii . in other words , _ where there is [ c  ii ] cooling , it is the result of fuv heating_.    the second tier of our approximation maintains that most photoelectric heating occurs in regions cooled by [ c  ii ] emission . if this did not hold , then the emission from another species like c  i  or co might provide most of the cooling in some fuv - heated regions and our @xmath36  predictions would be overestimates .",
    "it is certainly true that c  i  and co are important coolants of translucent clouds , but in terms of total flux the [ c  i ] and co lines are much weaker than the [ c  ii ] line .",
    "the brightest known hlc source of [ c  i ] , mbm12 , has a maximum observed [ c  i ] ( ) integrated intensity of about @xmath70 @xcite , a factor of 10 weaker than the [ c  ii ] emission towards most of our hlcs . according to the photodissociation region models of @xcite , the other [ c  i ] fine structure transition , ( @xmath71 ) ,",
    "should have at most twice the power of the ( ) transition under translucent conditions ( fuv flux equal to the local interstellar value and gas volume density @xmath72 ) . even if all of the c  i  atoms that emit in these transitions were excited by fuv - ejected electrons ,",
    "the photoelectric heating in the [ c  i]-emitting regions of hlcs is still at most only 30% of that in the [ c  ii]-emitting areas .",
    "furthermore , co cooling is almost an order of magnitude weaker than [ c  i ] cooling for translucent clouds ( eg . , see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , _ where there is significant fuv heating , most of the cooling is by [ c  ii ] radiation_.      here we calculate the intensity spectrum of the interstellar radiation field inside a model cloud , as it is attenuated and processed by dust grains .",
    "we adopt a plane parallel geometry , where changes in the mean radiative properties of the gas and dust are dependent only on the optical depth , @xmath73 , measured from the surface of the cloud to the center .",
    "the cloud size is defined by the central optical depth , @xmath74 .    the interstellar radiation field , @xmath75 , is isotropic and incident on both sides of our plane parallel clouds .",
    "we consider only the stellar component of the isrf longward of 0.0912  ( the lyman continuum ) , and the cosmic background radiation field .",
    "we use the isrf approximation of @xcite and @xcite , which is the sum of a stellar uv component and three diluted blackbodies .",
    "we add to this the cosmic background radiation field , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the planck function .",
    "we calculate the integrated intensity of the interstellar radiation field to be @xmath78 this is 27% higher than the value quoted by @xcite , partly because we consider a larger range of wavelength than they did . in constructing an isrf , we do not include clouds themselves as infrared sources .",
    "infrared photons have little affect on the energetics of translucent clouds because the clouds are transparent to them .",
    "furthermore , the interstellar infrared spectrum results from the processing of stellar radiation by clouds , and does not represent a new source of energy .",

    "the scattering modifiers , \\{@xmath86 } , are the reciprocal eigenvalues of an @xmath87 tridiagonal symmetric matrix , * x * , given by equation ( a3 ) of @xcite .",
    "if we use the scattering phase function introduced by @xcite , then the matrix elements are functions only of the dust grain albedo , @xmath88 , and the mean cosine of the scattering angle , @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath90 notation we use denotes an average of dust optical properties over the grain population ( see appendix ) .",
    "the @xmath91th off - diagonal element of the matrix , @xmath92 , equals @xmath93 , where @xmath94 the matrix is symmetric , so @xmath95 .",
    "in practice we truncate the series in equation [ jlambda ] to @xmath96 terms , since for the wavelengths of interest @xmath97 is less than 1% of the value of @xmath98 .",

    "we use the equation [ jlambda ] attenuated radiation field to compute the heating function for dust grains and the photoelectric heating function for the gas .",
    "our assumption of thermal equilibrium then allows us to estimate the surface brightness of 100  and 60  radiation from the dust and the [ c  ii ] emission line cooling of the gas .",
    "the temperature of a spherical grain of radius @xmath103 and material @xmath104 ( see appendix ) , measured at depth @xmath67  in a cloud of central thickness @xmath102 , is @xmath105 .",

    "this requires : @xmath106 where @xmath77 is the planck function and @xmath107 is the absorption efficiency ( see appendix ) .",
    "the assumption here is that dust grains are in thermal equilibrium .",

    "we have solved equation [ dustbalance ] numerically for the function @xmath109 . as an example , we plot in figure [ heating ] the equilibrium temperature of a graphite ( @xmath110 ) grain of size @xmath111 as a function of @xmath67 , for a cloud with @xmath112mag , immersed in a @xmath113 interstellar radiation field . at the surface of the cloud",

    "is necessary .      the most important way to transfer energy from the isrf to",
    "the gas is via the photoelectric effect on dust grains .",
    "photoelectric heating of the gas can occur when photons with energies larger than the grain work function expel electrons .",
    "a typical neutral grain work function is @xmath118 , so it is mainly fuv photons ( @xmath119 ; @xmath120 ) that contribute to the photoelectric effect .",
    "the photoelectric heating mechanism has been explored in detail by @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath5 , the `` photoelectric heating efficiency , '' is expected to be @xmath121 for neutral grains @xcite .",
    "this can be explained using a simple heuristic argument .",
    "an average fuv photon has energy of 8@xmath69 , which causes an electron with 2.5@xmath69of kinetic energy to be released from a neutral grain with work function 5.5@xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "30% of the incoming photon s energy is liberated .",
    "the typical photoelectric yield is 10% , i.e. ,  10% of all photons absorbed by grains actually ionize them .",
    "therefore , the fraction of photon energy absorbed that gets injected into the gas as kinetic energy is @xmath122 .",
    "the neutral grain photoelectric efficiency is an upper limit to the actual value of @xmath5 .",

    "are expected to be ionized @xcite , implying relatively high photoelectric efficiency in translucent clouds .",
    "we used our cloud model to estimate the gas heating in translucent clouds . to compute the total amount of fuv energy absorbed by grains we first estimated the mean absorption cross section per h  atom as a function of wavelength , @xmath124 : @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are defined in the appendix .",
    "@xcite estimated that approximately one half of the heating in interstellar clouds is caused by tiny carbon grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) with sizes less than 15 , and the other half comes from larger grains with @xmath128 .",
    "the size distribution in the @xcite model ( equation [ graindist ] ) has a minimum cutoff , @xmath129 , so we had to extend the grain parameter calculations of @xcite to include smaller graphite grains .",

    "we also assumed that the mean scattering cosine for graphite , @xmath133 , follows the mie expansion given in ( * ? ? ? * their equation 8) .    the local gas heating function , @xmath134 , is derived by integrating the mean intensity of the local radiation field , weighted by the absorption cross section per h  atom and the photoelectric efficiency , over all fuv wavelengths and solid angles : @xmath135 the units of @xmath134 are erg@xmath136 . in figure [ heating ]",

    "the emergent thermal dust emission spectrum can be derived by converting to @xmath144  per @xmath67 using the standard relation , @xmath147 , integrating @xmath145 from the surface of the cloud to the center , and multiplying by 2 : @xmath148 the factor 2 is necessary because the integral is from the edge to the center of a symmetrical one - dimensional cloud .",

    "thus , only for extremely opaque clouds ( @xmath153mag ) is most of the input radiation recovered as fir emission , and the input flux is never exceeded .",
    "we can use figure [ firspec ] to predict that clouds with large @xmath154 appear `` colder '' than clouds with small @xmath154 , provided @xmath4 is held constant .",
    "the long wavelength spectrum mimics the emission by dust at a single temperature .",
    "thick gray curves in figure [ firspec ] show modified blackbody spectra for clouds with the same sizes ( values of @xmath102 ) as the model clouds , but with different `` dust temperatures , '' @xmath155(19,18,16.9,15.1)k , for @xmath156 . here",
    "the blackbody function at @xmath157 was modified by the dust emissivity , assumed to be proportional to @xmath158 .",
    "the modified blackbody curves reproduce the model spectra quite well for wavelengths longward of the peak .",
    "we find that a thicker cloud produces more emission than a thinner cloud , but its spectrum peaks at a longer wavelength ( vertical arrows ) , yielding a lower `` dust temperature , '' as shown by the gray curves .",
    "the same behavior was noticed for a large sample of high  latitude clouds by @xcite , who found that the average color temperature for dust mixed with hlc atomic gas is @xmath159 , whereas for dust mixed with hlc molecular gas the average color temperature is @xmath160 .",
    "this happens because , even though opaque clouds absorb more of the isrf than transparent clouds , most of the dust in their interiors is exposed to an attenuated version of the isrf that is deficient in high energy photons .",
    "our model can be used to estimate the 60 and 100   surface brightness , @xmath38  and @xmath39 , towards translucent clouds , as well as the _",

    "( @xmath44/ ) of translucent clouds decreases with increasing , as is observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "another way to demonstrate that thicker clouds have `` cooler '' dust emission is to compare the surface brightness ratio @xmath38/@xmath39with visual extinction , as we have done empirically for mbm-12 .",
    "gray curves on figure [ mbm12_av_color ] show that , in our model , the 60/100 color decreases with @xmath67  (= 2@xmath102 ) and increases with @xmath4 .",

    "such behavior was already noticed and discussed qualitatively for translucent clouds in the lynds 134 cloud complex ( which contains two objects in our sample , mbm-37 and mbm-33 ) @xcite .",
    "cuts across the densest regions of l134 @xcite show that the 60/100 color decreases as b - band extinction , @xmath162 , increases . we have compared the @xcite l134 data to our model ( using @xmath163 ) , and we find a good match for @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "there is a sudden drop in 60/100 for extremely opaque ( @xmath166 ) lines of sight towards the l134 complex @xcite , which the model does not predict .",
    "the authors attribute this to a change in dust properties ( see  5.3 ) .",
    "we estimate the [ c  ii ] integrated intensity towards translucent clouds .",
    "recall our key assumptions that the gas cools only through emission in the ( ) transition of c  ii , and that the gas is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we set the cooling , @xmath167 ( i.e. ,  the [ c  ii ] emission per ) , equal to the gas heating , @xmath134 , given by equation [ heating_eq ] .",
    "the integrated intensity of the [ c  ii ] emission is : @xmath168    we plot in figure [ cooling ] the [ c  ii ] integrated intensity , @xmath36 , as a function of @xmath102  for clouds with @xmath113 and @xmath137 .",
    "the two upper curves highlight the differences between gas and dust heating by interstellar radiation .",
    "the qualitative behavior of both curves is the same .",
    "that is , both @xmath44 and @xmath36rise almost linearly , implying linear increases in column - averaged dust and gas heating with extinction ; then both curves show a decrease in slope , implying that clouds with central extinction larger than a transition size produce much less emission at depths greater than this size .",
    "the effect of reaching the transition sizes is different for the two tracers .",
    "the @xmath36  emission becomes flat at @xmath169mag , whereas @xmath44 only shows a decrease in slope , without flattening even for @xmath170mag . in the interior of a translucent cloud the mean integrated intensity of fuv",
    "radiation is much smaller than that of optical radiation ( refer to figure [ lambdajlambda ] ) .",
    "dust grains are heated by isrf photons of all wavelengths , but photoelectrons , which lead to [ c  ii ] emission , are ejected only by fuv photons .",
    "thus , one expects the [ c  ii ] emission to extinguish before the @xmath44 emission does .",
    "the model for @xmath44 and [ c  ii ] emission depends on three parameters ( see equations [ firspec_eq ] and [ ciicool ] ) : ( 1 ) the cloud column density , given by @xmath102 ; ( 2 ) the incident isrf flux , @xmath4 , in units of the expected flux at the sun ; and ( 3 ) the photoelectric heating efficiency , @xmath5 . we have computed cloud models for @xmath102  ranging from 0 to 5mag , and @xmath4 ranging from 0.2 to 4.0 .",
    "the [ c  ii ] results scale linearly with the photoelectric heating efficiency ( equation [ heating_eq ] ) , so it was trivial to vary @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ cp_fir_model ] shows plots of @xmath36  as a function of @xmath44 for four different combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the curves show two types of behavior : `` linear '' behavior for low values of @xmath44 ; and `` flat '' behavior for high values of @xmath44 .",
    "this is due to the difference between dust and gas heating mentioned above .",
    "the linear behavior occurs when @xmath102  is low enough that both dust and gas heating increase linearly with @xmath102 .",
    "the flat behavior occurs when @xmath102is high enough for fuv heating of the gas to become negligible in cloud interiors , causing [ c  ii ] emission to extinguish , but not high enough for optical heating of dust grains to become negligible , so fir emission is still produced .",
    "we have analyzed models for a range of @xmath4 and @xmath5 values .",
    "the behavior of @xmath36  and @xmath44 in the linear regime can be approximated by : @xmath171 errors represent formal uncertainties in fits to the grid of cloud models .",
    "the slope of the linear behavior ( equation [ linear_eq ] ) depends primarily on @xmath5 and only weakly on @xmath4 .",
    "the slope should not depend at all on @xmath4 , since both @xmath36  and the true fir integrated intensity should be linearly proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "recall , however , that for comparison with observations we have approximated @xmath44 using @xmath38  and @xmath39  ( see equation [ fir_def ] ) , i.e. ,  we bias the @xmath44 integral artificially towards short far - infrared wavelengths . as @xmath4 increases",
    ", the short wavelength surface brightness increases faster than linearly , since the peak of the fir spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths .",
    "thus our @xmath44 values should also increase with @xmath4 faster than linearly , while the integrated spectrum increases linearly .",
    "the [ c  ii ] intensity in the flat regime can be approximated by : @xmath172 the flatness occurs because at high opacity all incident fuv radiation has been absorbed and converted to photoelectric heating ( with efficiency @xmath5 ) .",
    "the maximum possible [ c  ii ] intensity ought to equal the total integrated fuv intensity in the isrf , multiplied by @xmath5 : @xmath173 equations [ fuv_integrated ] and [ flat_eq ] are indistinguishable to within 4% .",
    "we superimpose gray line segments on the curves drawn in figure [ cp_fir_model ] , representing the linear and flat portions of the curves , computed using the approximations in equations [ linear_eq ] and [ flat_eq ] .",
    "we define the transition value of @xmath44 to be the value when @xmath174 , i.e.,@xmath175 the @xmath44 value at which a transition between the linear and flat regimes occurs depends wholly on @xmath4 .",
    "we can use equation [ fir_def ] to derive a 100  surface brightness at the linear to flat transition for typical cnm gas ( @xmath176 ) : @xmath177      we can constrain @xmath5 and @xmath4 by comparing our model for the [ c  ii ] and @xmath44 emission of translucent clouds to the _ iso _ observations of high  latitude clouds .",
    "first we use the simple equations that we derived for the linear , flat , and transition zones . recall that the observations can be fit by a straight line with slope @xmath178 ( equation [ cp_fir_fit ] ) .",

    "the binned data , however ( figure [ cp_fir_bins ] ) , show a statistically significant departure from this slope at around @xmath180 .",
    "this appears to be the transition between the linear and flat regimes .",
    "equation [ transition_eq ] gives @xmath181 , thus @xmath182 .    a more sophisticated way to determine",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath4 for translucent clouds is to compare a grid of models to the data , and find the best fit .",
    "recall that cloud column density , or central visual extinction , is the independent variable , whereas @xmath44 and @xmath36  are predicted by the model . given a grid of models , we can `` work backwards '' from the observed @xmath44 surface brightness to determine @xmath102  as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "effectively @xmath44 becomes the independent variable .",
    "the resulting @xmath102  numbers yield a set of predicted [ c  ii ] integrated intensities , @xmath183 that we can compare with the data .",

    "the observed decrease in [ c  ii ] emissivity at high values of @xmath44 ( figure [ cp_fir_bins ] ) is reproduced by the model , signifying that hlcs with @xmath197 absorb most incident fuv photons .",
    "in this paper we have studied the [ c  ii ] and far  infrared ( fir ) emission towards high  latitude translucent molecular clouds ( hlcs ) .",
    "these observational signatures of the processing of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) by the clouds help to elucidate the role of dust grains in heating the gas .",

    "the confirmation is not just qualitative : the proportionality constant is the same for both _ cobe _ and _ iso_. at low extinction the @xmath44 integrated intensity is proportional to the h  i  column density , so the [ c  ii ] _ emissivity _ is constant for all low - extinction interstellar regions .",
    "the [ c  ii ] emissivity decreases for high extinction lines of sight due to the attenuation of fuv photons that cause photoelectric heating , an effect that was unnoticed in the low resolution _ cobe",

    ". we do not have enough high extinction sources in our sample to be sure that @xmath36  flattens completely , as predicted by our model . at the minimum",
    ", there is a link between the decreasing emissivity of [ c  ii ] and the transition from mostly `` warm '' to mostly `` cold '' values of @xmath38/@xmath39 , because most warm positions have low @xmath44 intensity and most cold positions have high @xmath44 intensity .",
    "the _ cobe _ data do not show a decrease in [ c  ii ] emissivity for high values of @xmath44 , probably because translucent hlcs are diluted inside the 7  _ cobe _ beam .",
    "the mean co emission size of hlcs is @xmath202 1  @xcite , but detectable co emission from hlcs covers less than 3% of the sky @xcite .",
    "thus on 7   scales , @xmath203 of [ c  ii ] emission is from purely atomic material , so the _ cobe _ survey yields only linear behavior for @xmath36  versus @xmath44 .",
    "the 70   _ iso _ beam , on the other hand , is capable of resolving translucent hlcs where the column - averaged [ c  ii ] emissivity is much lower than in diffuse h  i.    the 60/100  color is often used to infer either the isrf flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or the grain size distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but our work indicates that for translucent clouds variations in @xmath38/@xmath39can be accounted for entirely by variations in the extinction .",
    "thicker clouds appear colder , even if the grain size distribution and the radiation field stay constant .",
    "fitting our model to the @xmath36  and @xmath44 data yields the same values of the photoelectric heating efficiency , @xmath5 , and the isrf flux , @xmath4 , for sources with both warm and cold 60/100 colors .",
    "the actual best fit values of the isrf flux and the photoelectric heating efficiency are noteworthy .",
    "we found that the most probable bolometric isrf flux incident on hlcs is @xmath190 , where @xmath204 defines the isrf spectrum of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also derive @xmath205 _ independently _ for cloud mbm-12 using the observed @xmath38/@xmath39  behavior as a function of visual extinction ( figure [ mbm12_av_color ] ) .",
    "the fuv portion of a @xmath190 field has an integrated flux of @xmath206 . in units of the @xcite flux ( @xmath207 ) , this gives @xmath208 , close to the actual value ( @xmath209 ) determined from space - based uv measurements @xcite .",
    "given that our model is so successful at determining @xmath210 , even without observing clouds in the flat regime where all fuv is absorbed , it is likely that the curve in figure [ cp_fir_bins_model ] is a realistic representation of the average [ c  ii ] and @xmath44 properties of translucent high  latitude clouds .",
    "this means that the decrease in [ c  ii ] emissivity that we detect is indeed the transition between regions with less than complete and complete fuv absorption , confirming the use of the term `` translucent '' to describe the hlcs .",
    "we predict that the [ c  ii ] emissivity should decrease further for hlc positions with higher extinction than those in our current sample .    the photoelectric heating efficiency that we derive , @xmath211 , is slightly higher than the value 3% derived from _ cobe _ data by @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath5 is the fraction of far - ultraviolet radiation absorbed by grains that is converted to gas heating . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath5 for the galaxy by dividing the observed [ c  ii ] integrated intensity by fir .",
    "in so doing , they equated @xmath36  with photoelectric heating , as we do ; but they also equated fir with the absorbed fuv flux , which is only partially true for translucent material . in the cold neutral medium half of the isrf flux that heats dust grains and causes fir emission is at optical wavelengths .",
    "the fir integrated surface brightness can only be used to estimate the absorbed fuv flux if clouds have nearby o and b stars , causing fuv photons to dominate the radiation field .    another way to obtain a crude estimate of @xmath5 for the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) is to consider the limiting case of complete fuv absorption in translucent gas .",
    "the [ c  ii ] cooling that should result is @xmath212 ( equation [ fuv_integrated ] ) . for our figure [ cp_fir ] hlc sample , @xmath213 , so the product @xmath214 .",
    "taking @xmath190 ( see above ) gives @xmath215 , implying that the cnm is extremely efficient at processing fuv radiation .",
    "in fact , both the 4.8% estimate and our best fit appraisal , @xmath216 , are consistent with the value 4.9% adduced as the maximum efficiency for neutral grains @xcite .",
    "fewer than 50% of the grains responsible for heating the cnm are expected to be ionized @xcite , so the grains should have close to maximal efficiency .",
    "our results depend on the assumption that all dust grains are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in particular , equations [ dustbalance ] and [ dustcool ] require this condition . as mentioned in  4.2.1 , thermal equilibrium breaks down for grains smaller than @xmath217 , which are heated by individual photons . these very small grains ( vsgs )",
    "get much hotter than the temperatures we derived by equating the average power absorbed with that emitted .",
    "the effect is most obvious at short wavelengths ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "thus our predicted thermal equilibrium 60  surface brightnesses are underestimates to the actual values derived when the stochastic heating of very small grains is considered . according to the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 8) , stochastically heated vsgs are responsible for approximately half of the 60  flux from _ diffuse _ high  latitude clouds ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "clearly this is an overestimate to the stochastic vsg contribution to the emission from translucent clouds , since the power absorbed ( and hence emitted ) by vsgs is a strong function of the fuv flux , which decreases inside translucent clouds .",
    "if our predictions for @xmath38  are underestimated by a factor @xmath219 , then our @xmath44 predictions will be underestimated by @xmath220 ( using equation [ fir_def ] and the fact that @xmath221 for average h  i  clouds ) . adding 20% to our model @xmath44",
    "values decreases by 20% the slope of the linear @xmath36  vs. @xmath44 relationship for a given ( @xmath5,@xmath4 ) pair .",
    "thus the derived product @xmath222 ( equation [ linear_eq ] ) decreases by 20% .",
    "this does not change significantly our conclusions , since @xmath223 is already uncertain by 23% .",
    "we need to take into account the small grain physics in more detail to assess accurately the errors due to our equilibrium approach .",
    "this will not change an important conclusion derived from our model : variations in the [ c  ii ] emissivity and the 60/100 color in translucent clouds reflect variations in grain heating , not changes in grain optical properties .",
    "it is likely that our conclusions will change for extremely opaque clouds , whose interiors may be sufficiently dense and free of uv photons for smaller dust particles to coagulate into larger grains .",
    "two compelling pieces of evidence for variations in the optical properties of grains are ( 1 ) an abrupt drop in 60/100 at @xmath224 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . neither feature is a characteristic of our model , so we caution against applying our conclusions directly to dark clouds .",
    "nonetheless , the effects should be negligible in the model s intended domain , i.e. , translucent clouds ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "in our analysis we made no explicit mention of the cloud density structure .",
    "we parametrized our model in terms of the visual extinction , which allows us to ignore density structure along the line of sight .",
    "if the volume density varies along the line of sight , the size scale associated with extinction varies , but this does not affect our calculations if all else remains the same , i.e. ,  the photoelectric effect is the major heating source and [ c  ii ] emission is the dominant cooling source .",
    "this is probably true .",
    "the brightest lines observed in hlcs ( @xmath227 ) account for approximately 5% of the incident fuv flux ( when @xmath228 ; see  5.2 and @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , the fuv heating is converted to [ c  ii ] cooling with very high efficiency .",
    "this probably requires that the [ c  ii ] excitation conditions are always thermal , i.e. ,  either the density is above the critical density , @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the collisional excitation coefficient ; or the temperature is above @xmath231 .",
    "the average cnm temperature is @xmath232 , but it ranges from 20200@xmath12  @xcite , so the h  i  gas is probably hot enough for [ c  ii ] to be thermalized . for cooler gas ( @xmath233 ) , the [ c  ii ]",
    "critical density is high .",
    "for excitation by @xmath234 , @xmath235 ; for excitation by h  i , @xmath236 . the co - emitting molecular regions of hlcs could have such high densities @xcite , but it is not clear that the [ c  ii]-emitting regions are so dense .",
    "it is probably the case that gas which is too rarefied to be supercritical either is hot enough for [ c  ii ] to be thermalized or does not contribute much to the overall extinction .",
    "we conclude that the detailed structure along the line of sight therefore has little effect on our analysis .",
    "structural variations in the _ plane of the sky _ are more difficult to account for , for two reasons .",
    "first , clouds with structure in three dimensions are more permeable to the interstellar radiation field , especially when one takes into account scattering of fuv photons by dust grains @xcite .",
    "second , the emission observed towards clouds is always the result of averaging the real emission across a telescope beam .",
    "comparing two tracers observed with the same beamsize towards the same position minimizes the effects of structured emission .",
    "unfortunately , the _ iras _ data we use have a resolution of 4 , whereas the _ iso _ [ c  ii ] measurements have only 71  resolution  a factor of 11 in beam area !",
    "we probably have enough data points that structural variations averaged out in statistics ( compare figure [ cp_fir ] to figure [ cp_fir_bins ] ) . nevertheless , to improve the robustness of our conclusions requires higher resolution fir observations , perhaps made with the space infrared telescope facility .",
    "a linear relationship is observed between the @xmath44 and [ c  ii ] emission for high galactic latitude molecular clouds observed with _ iso _ that is indistinguishable from the prediction based on high  latitude _ cobe _ data , implying that the [ c  ii ] emissivity is constant for all low - extinction gas . at high extinction the [ c  ii ] emissivity begins to decrease due to the attenuation of the fuv portion of the interstellar radiation field .",
    "in contrast to other work , we find that differences in the 60/100  color can be accounted for solely by extinction variations .",
    "sources with both warm and cold colors seem to be exposed to the same radiation field , equal to the mean field near the sun ; and have the same photoelectric heating efficiency , close to the value for neutral grains .",
    "the transition from sources with warm to those with cold 60/100 colors coincides approximately with the transition from constant to decreasing [ c  ii ] emissivity .",
    "such regions where the fuv spectrum is attenuated and softened , but is still important for heating the gas , define the translucent regime .",
    "we are indebted to laurent cambrey for providing us with an extinction map of mbm12 , produced using his adaptive - grid star count algorithm .",
    "this paper benefited from the penetrating comments and helpful suggestions of george helou , francois boulanger , and jean - philipe bernard .",

    "we assume that grains are spherical with radius @xmath103 , and come in two kinds , graphite ( @xmath110 ) and `` astronomical silicate '' ( @xmath237 ) .",

    "following @xcite , we assume a power law distribution of grain sizes : @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the number of grains per h atom of type @xmath104 with radii between @xmath103 and @xmath243 , and the upper and lower size limits are @xmath244 and @xmath245 , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath246 were determined by @xcite to be @xmath247 for graphite and @xmath248 for silicate .",
    "the values of the @xmath249 coefficients were derived by fitting the theoretical extinction curve ( see equation [ extincurve ] below ) to the observed average extinction curve for the galaxy @xcite .",
