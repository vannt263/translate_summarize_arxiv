    "the extraction of band positions at the m point has been an important part of previous studies of fese , where it has been claimed that a split peak structure arises from a single peak ( i.e. the degenerate @xmath3 bands at m ) either at @xmath4 @xcite or above @xmath4 @xcite . in the main text we argued that this is not the correct scenario , and that the edc above @xmath4 must arise from two separate features ,",
    "even if they are not well - distinguished , and there is a well - defined transition at @xmath4 .",
    "other studies have typically used a second derivative analysis to determine the band positions , but this can give conflicting results @xcite . as described in the main text , for this study we decided to take a novel approach to the problem by directly fitting the edc to extract band positions .    at 61 k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sm1]a ) , the peaks are clearly distinct , and here we perform a fit to the data with two asymmetric pseudo - voigt functions with additional background , multiplied by the fermi function - that is , with 14 free parameters such that the peak profiles are very well fitted .",
    "however , once this fit is converged , at higher temperatures we use exactly the same parameters ( amplitude , peak width , asymmetry parameters and background ) , except for an overall peak width term which is fixed to increase linearly with temperature to account for the experimental increase in peak width with temperature . we therefore extract the band positions above 61  k from a final fit which has only the peak positions free - i.e. a fit with only two free parameters .",
    "representative fits are displayed in fig .",

    "we present further details of the photon energy - dependence of the electron bands at m point , at low temperatures in a twinned sample .",
    "the photon energy dependence of the hole pockets of fese has been previously reported @xcite , revealing a significant @xmath10 dependence of the outer hole pocket . at the m point",
    ", the fermi surface shows a smaller warping effect , as the @xmath14 of the outer pocket shrinks from 0.193 @xmath26 ( 56 ev - a point ) to 0.142 @xmath26 ( 42 ev - m point ) .",
    "this supports the analysis of quantum oscillation frequencies @xcite where it was determined that the electron pocket was less dispersive in @xmath10 compared to the hole pocket .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energy splitting at the m point appears to be @xmath10-independent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm3]b ) .",
    "this indicates that the orbital ordering has no significant @xmath10 dependence .",
    "thus the band positions at the m point do not change significantly with @xmath10 , but the effective mass of the dispersion of the outer electron band from the m point does rise with @xmath10 , giving rise to the warping of the fermi surface .",
    "this can be directly observed by comparing the cuts at different photon energies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm3]c - e ) , where the most substantial difference between them is the @xmath2 band dispersion .",
    "note that one previous measurement of the @xmath10 dependence at the m point did not find any significant @xmath10 dependence at the m - a point @xcite , which we find surprising .",
    "taking into account the @xmath10 dispersions of both the hole and electron pockets , we determine that the inner potential ( @xmath27 ) appropriate for fese is approximately 12.2  ev .          _ the model : _ in the main text , we presented fermi surfaces and band dispersions for a 10-orbital tight binding model , in the form originally proposed in ref .",
    "the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite were used as a starting point , with some adjustments made in order to better match the arpes dispersions at high temperature . in practice",
    "we adapted the parameters until the low - lying bands at @xmath17 and m are described well ; however some details such as the dispersion of the @xmath2 hole band are less well captured .    _",
    "motivation of order parameter : _ we now discuss how the inclusion of a unidirectional nematic bond order term in our tight binding model is required in order to understand the arpes data",
    ". motivated by the experimental data , we added the following term to the 10-orbital model hamiltonian in the inter - site blocks :      here the @xmath22 direction corresponds to a fe - fe direction and the longer @xmath29 axis of the orthorhombic unit cell .",
    "we make the distinction here between @xmath21 the on - site orbital number operator , and @xmath20 which is the operator for inter - site hopping between @xmath0 orbitals . we describe it as  unidirectional nematic bond order \" since there is a @xmath30 but not @xmath31 term .    in the unfolded 1-fe unit cell ( i.e. 5-orbital model ) , the two crossed ellipses that occur at the m point in the crystallographic 2-fe unit cell are unfolded to different positions in momentum space ; the pockets containing @xmath0 and @xmath1 character exist at @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "experimentally , we have determined that these two ellipses must distort symmetrically .",
    "this could not occur for an order parameter defined homogeneously across the brillouin zone , e.g. a ferro - orbital ordering , since the two pockets would distort in opposite directions due to their different orbital characters .",
    "therefore we considered momentum - dependent order parameters , and in particular a @xmath30 term ensures that the orbital splitting has different signs at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . due to the distinction in the orbital character at each electron pocket , this makes band shifts at each point",
    "occur symmetrically , and when folding back to the m point of the 2-fe brillouin zone , the fermi surface has become more elongated as in experiment but the degeneracy of @xmath36 bands is not broken",
    ". a @xmath31 momentum - dependence could also give symmetric shifts at the m point , however this would lead to the opposite distortions of the hole pocket compared to measurements on detwinned single crystals @xcite .",
    "therefore we can not rule out the existence of an additional bond nematic ordering with @xmath31 modulation and significantly smaller magnitude than our primary @xmath37 term .",
    "however experimentally the magnitude of the band shifts at m and the extra splitting at @xmath17 are similar and therefore a single unidirectional order parameter is sufficient .",
    "the first term here corresponds to ",
    "extended @xmath39-wave bond nematic order \" @xcite and the second is an allowed hopping term which does nt break any symmetries ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : sm4 ] ) .",
    "therefore the symmetries which are broken at @xmath4 are those of the extended @xmath39-wave bond nematic order , i.e. breaking rotational but not translational symmetry ( thus it is truly a ",
    "nematic \" order parameter ) .",
    "however although this decomposition is mathematically valid and noteworthy , it seems to us that our description of a unidirectional nematic bond order is more intuitively related to the underlying physics than using the description given by this linear combination .",
    "in particular , since the extended @xmath39-wave bond nematic order vanishes at the m point , this description would rely on symmetry - allowed hoppings to give the order - parameter - like behaviour at the m point @xcite , which seems unphysical .",
    "_ comparison with other orbital orderings : _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm4 ] we present a selection of fermi surfaces in the presence of alternative orbital ordering schemes , sugggested by various authors for describing the nematic state . the simplest case is on - site ferro - orbital ordering @xcite in b ) which is not viable since it breaks @xmath36 symmetry at the m point .",
    "the @xmath18-wave bond nematic order @xcite also fails due to the splitting at m and absence of splitting at @xmath17 .",
    "the extended @xmath39-wave bond nematic order was introduced in @xcite as a possible nematic order , but has no signature at the m point . in e ) we show that the  allowed hopping terms \" introduced above which break no symmetry could account for the evolution of the m point alone .",
    "thus a linear combination of the extended @xmath39-wave bond nematic and the extra hopping could account for the low - temperature fermi surface and are mathematically equivalent to our unidirectional nematic bond order .",
    "finally we reproduce the unidirectional nematic bond order parameter from the main text .",
    "_ on - site vs bond order : _ in a 5-orbital model , one could choose an order parameter @xmath40 which would reproduce the experimental fermi surface .",
    "since the 5-orbital model does not distinguish between on - site number and inter - site orbital hopping operators , this leaves ambiguity in the interpretation .",
    "however when using the full 10-orbital model , the order parameter must be placed in the inter - site hopping terms to reproduce the experimental fermi surface .",
    "the interpretation of on - site stripe antiferro - orbital ordering ( or any other pattern ) is forbidden since this would require translational symmetry - breaking and additionally has the wrong periodicity .    _",
    "the @xmath2 band : _ experimentally , the sections of fermi surface with @xmath2 character also shift , although relatively less .",
    "we accounted for this with a 10 mev downwards shift of the @xmath2 orbital energy in the tight - binding model .",
    "one way to understand this is by noting that the total volume of the fermi surface must be approximately conserved in the nematic phase since the distortion of the hole pocket is approximately symmetry - preserving .",
    "therefore a downward shift of the @xmath2 electron band dispersion could simply be a necessary consequence of the upward shift of both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "however alternative interpretations could be possible .",
    "_ dirac points : _ finally we note that our model indicates that spin - orbit coupling gaps out the @xmath41 band crossing slightly away from m , which has elsewhere been proposed as a dirac point",
    ". this can also be directly observed in the data , where band discontinuities are observed at the crossing points of @xmath0 and @xmath2 bands , e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm2 ] . in fact the spin - orbit induced splitting is of comparable magnitude to the fermi energy and therefore we question whether the dirac description can be appropriate for these points ."

    "<S> moreover , ferro - orbital ordering is not consistent with the direction of distortion of the hole band , as revealed by arpes measurements on detwinned crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a nel - type antiferro - orbital ordering would preserve the @xmath3 degeneracy at m , but it can not explain the extra splitting observed between @xmath3 bands at the @xmath17/z point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recently proposed @xmath18-wave bond nematic order predicts a splitting at the m point @xcite , as does the microscopic model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we suggest that a  unidirectional nematic bond ordering \" is compatible with all the observations .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] we present tight - binding model electronic structures with and without the proposed unidirectional nematic bond order . </S>",
    "<S> we use a 2d ten - orbital tight binding model including spin - orbit coupling @xcite ( sm ) . within this model , </S>",
    "<S> we add an order parameter to the inter - site hopping block of the hamiltonian as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 indicates the inter - site hopping operator distinct from on - site occupations @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this order parameter therefore describes a symmetry - breaking within the inter - site @xmath3 hopping terms on the fe - fe bonds in the @xmath22 direction . </S>",
    "<S> this order parameter has the desired properties of giving an extra splitting in addition to the spin - orbit coupling splitting of @xmath3 bands at the @xmath17 point , but a symmetric shift up of the @xmath3 bands at the m point without losing the degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> it still globally breaks fourfold rotational symmetry yet it can also be simply shown that it does not break translational symmetry ( sm ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]b , c ) we present the results of a calculation with @xmath23  =  20  mev ; we also include an adjustment of -10  mev to the @xmath2 orbital which is motivated by the experimental results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] and may be required to maintain the charge balance of the system . within this fairly simple model </S>",
    "<S> we obtain fermi surfaces and dispersions which reproduce all qualitative features of the low - lying electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we suggest that the changes to the electronic structure of fese in the orthorhombic phase may be primarily described by a unidirectional nematic bond ordering .    since the fermi surface changes at the m point are not of a symmetry - breaking nature , and @xmath11 is finite even above @xmath4 , there is an important question about how tightly the evolution of the electron pockets is linked to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however we have shown that there is a sharp increase in @xmath11 which onsets exactly at @xmath4 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1]j ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the deviation in @xmath14 values of both the inner and outer electron pocket branches also follows a sharp order - parameter - like behaviour which onsets at @xmath4 , and this deviation of the inner pocket was shown to behave as an order parameter of the structural transition across the fese@xmath7s@xmath8 series @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the changes at the m point are still fundamentally linked to the orthorhombic lattice distortion . </S>",
    "<S> this may be understood since in the unfolded 1-fe brillouin zone , the electron pockets with @xmath0 and @xmath1 character are located in different parts of @xmath24-space , and therefore the @xmath25 term ensures that they shift symmetrically , such that degeneracy is not lost in the folded 2-fe zone ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the apparently non - symmetry breaking band movements at m are linked to an ordering which globally _ does _ break tetragonal symmetry concomitant with the tetragonal - orthorhombic lattice distortion at @xmath4 .    within the longstanding debate about the roles of orbital and spin degrees of freedom in fe - based superconductors @xcite , fese is often considered as an example where orbital interactions may be dominant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however we have excluded any significant ferro - orbital ordering , and furthermore we have found that the primary order parameter is bond - centered and that translational symmetry is not broken , in contrast to some proposals @xcite . intriguingly , a bond - centered ordering is also observed in cuprates @xcite , although in that case it has an incommensurate modulation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> there are mixed reports on how relevant magnetic interactions are to the structural transition in fese @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of energy shifts ( e.g. 20 mev for the @xmath3 bands at m ) are similar to the spin - orbit coupling value of 20 mev in fese @xcite , suggesting that a spin - driven scenario is not ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> thus our data excludes several proposed orbital ordering scenarios , and instead points to the existence of a unidirectional nematic bond ordered phase in fese , breaking rotational but not translational symmetry , which is distinct from the known striped antiferromagnetic phase in other fe - based superconductors .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented a high - resolution arpes study of fese , and argued that the symmetry - breaking distortion of the hole pockets at the @xmath17 point but symmetry - preserving changes of the electron pockets at the m point below @xmath4 point can be explained by a unidirectional nematic bond ordering . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements provide a fresh perspective on the nature of the nematic phase of fe - based superconductors . </S>"
