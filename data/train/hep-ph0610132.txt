    "the study of hybrid mesons deserves much interest in theoretical as well as in experimental particle physics . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", these particles are interpreted as mesons in which the color field is in an excited state .",
    "numerous lattice qcd calculations have been devoted to the study of hybrid mesons , in particular to the energy levels of the gluonic field @xcite and to the properties of the @xmath2 state , which is the lightest hybrid with exotic quantum numbers ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for useful references ) . on the experimental side",
    ", we can mention the recently observed @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , which could be either hybrid mesons , or tetraquark states @xcite .",
    "apart from lattice qcd , hybrid mesons have been studied with effective models for a long time .",
    "for example , we can quote the flux tube model @xcite , models with constituent gluons @xcite , or the mit bag model @xcite . in potential models , to which our paper is devoted , there are two main approaches . in the first one ,",
    "the quark and the antiquark are linked by a string , or flux tube , which simulates the exchange of gluons responsible for the confinement .",
    "if the string is in the ground state , it reduces to the usual linear confinement potential for heavy quarks , and to a more general flux tube model for light quarks , where the dynamics of the string can not be neglected @xcite . in this stringy picture , it is possible for the flux tube to fluctuate at the quantum level , and thus to be in an excited state .",
    "these string excitations are analog to the gluon field excitations in full qcd .",
    "they have been studied for example in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the second approach",
    ", it is assumed that the hybrid meson is a three - body system , formed of a quark , an antiquark , and a constituent gluon , which represents the gluonic excitation .",
    "two fundamental strings then link the gluon to the quark and to the antiquark .",
    "this picture has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also in more recent works @xcite .    nowadays , the spinless salpeter hamiltonian ( ssh ) with a linear confinement is a widely used and successful framework to compute hadron spectra in potential models ( see previous references ) . since",
    "its kinetic operator is a semi - relativistic one , most of the results are numerically obtained .",
    "however , the auxiliary field ( af ) technique , also known as the einbein field method , allows to greatly simplify the calculations @xcite . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the af method leads to analytic solutions for the eigenvalues and wave functions of the two - body ssh . even if they are approximations , these solutions are qualitatively in agreement with well - known experimental facts , the regge trajectories for example .",
    "the af technique was also applied to the case of hybrid mesons with a constituent gluon and two static quarks .",
    "this model is able to reproduce some lattice results concerning the gluonic energy levels and the heavy hybrid spectroscopy .",
    "moreover , it suggests a correspondence between the excited flux tube and the constituent gluon approaches @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is now to apply the af technique to the full @xmath1 system , without demanding that the quark and the antiquark are static , in order to obtain formula which are valid for arbitrary quark mass .",
    "moreover , we will further investigate the links between the excited string and the constituent gluon pictures .",
    "eventually , we will show that these approaches are equivalent for heavy quarks .",
    "our formalism will also allow us to study whether this equivalence is modified in the light quark sector or not .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ afintro ] , we review the main properties of the af method by applying it to the simple case of mesons . in sec .",
    "[ hybexci ] , we discuss the excited flux tube model of hybrid mesons .",
    "then , we analytically solve the @xmath1 three - body problem corresponding to hybrid mesons with a constituent gluon in sec .",
    "[ hybcons ] , and give some physical results concerning their mass and structure . in sec .",
    "[ eff2pot ] , we derive the effective quark - antiquark potential for the @xmath0 system within a hybrid meson , and we discuss its links to the excited string picture .",
    "finally , we compare our results to lattice qcd in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] , and draw some conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "a system made of two hadrons interacting through a linear confinement can be described by the following ssh @xmath6 where @xmath7 since we work in the center of mass frame .",
    "the linear confinement can be understood as the static contribution of a straight string , or flux tube , of tension @xmath8 , linking the quark and the antiquark @xcite . in order to get rid of the square roots appearing in hamiltonian  ( [ ham1 ] ) ,",
    "let us now introduce three af : two for the quarks , denoted @xmath9 , and one for the potential , @xmath10 .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ ham1 ] ) then becomes @xmath11 although being formally simpler , @xmath12 is equivalent to @xmath13 up to the elimination of the af thanks to the constraints    [ elim ] @xmath14    it is worth mentioning that @xmath15 can be seen as a dynamical mass of the quark whose current mass is @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is in this case the static string energy @xcite",
    ". relations  ( [ elim ] ) show that the af are , strictly speaking , operators . however , the calculations are considerably simplified if the af are considered as real numbers , and finally eliminated by a minimization of the masses @xcite .",
    "the extremal values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , considered as numbers , are logically close to the values @xmath15 and @xmath18 given by relations  ( [ elim ] ) .",
    "this procedure leads to a spectrum which is an upper bound of the  true spectrum \" ( computed without af ) , the differences being about @xmath19 @xcite .    using the af",
    ", hamiltonian  ( [ ham1 ] ) turns out to be formally a simple nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator  ( [ ham2 ] ) . its mass spectrum and wave functions read @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 and where @xmath23 is a normalized radial eigenfunction of the three dimensional harmonic oscillator .    in the special case of a light meson",
    ", one can set @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath25 , and one obtains after the elimination of the af @xcite @xmath26 at large angular momentum , it appears that the square mass increases linearly with @xmath27 .",
    "thus , our solution qualitatively reproduces the regge trajectories , which are the best known experimental fact concerning the light meson spectroscopy .",
    "the regge slope is here given by @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 , which is the exact value of the regge slope in the flux tube model @xcite .",
    "this is related to the af technique itself which gives good qualitative results , but overestimates the masses .",
    "more precisely , the error on the exact value increases with the number of af introduced , as shown in ref .  @xcite . as a check of this point , we can mention that with only one af , the regge slope can be computed to be @xmath30 @xcite . what can be done to cure this artifact of the af method",
    "is to rescale @xmath8 : as we know that the exact regge slope is around @xmath31 , with the standard value @xmath32 gev@xmath33 , let us set @xmath34 .",
    "then , a mass formula such as expression  ( [ mass2_4 ] ) is able to correctly reproduce the experimental regge slope of the mesons @xcite . in the following",
    ", a rescaling of the string tension will be used to improve the results given by the af calculations .",
    "an other interesting case is a system composed of a light quark and of a heavy quark .",
    "one finds that , for such a system @xcite , @xmath35 the regge slope for a heavy - light meson is half of the one for a light - light meson . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "again , the correct regge slope in this case is not @xmath36 but @xmath37 @xcite . with the same rescaling as above , @xmath38",
    ", the approximate result  ( [ masshl0 ] ) can be greatly improved .",
    "equation  ( [ masshl0 ] ) can also be applied to a special type of heavy hybrid mesons called hybrid gluelumps , that is a pointlike heavy @xmath0 pair with mass @xmath39 bound to a constituent gluon .",
    "we have then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the string tension between the gluon and the @xmath0 pair . note that @xmath42 and @xmath27 are the quantum numbers of the gluon , since the dynamics of the heavy @xmath0 pair can be neglected .",
    "such a regge - like behavior for heavy hybrid mesons has been obtained numerically in ref .",
    "it is generally accepted that the static potential between the quark and the antiquark in an usual meson is compatible with a funnel potential , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the coulomb part comes from one - gluon exchange process , while the @xmath45 part is a pure confinement : it corresponds to the ( classical ) energy of a straight string linking the quark and the antiquark , and whose energy density is @xmath8 .",
    "the description of the confining interaction in terms of such a string is an effective approach which can be derived from qcd @xcite .",
    "let us note that the spectrum obtained with potential  ( [ pot_qq ] ) is in good agreement with experimental data for the light and heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "typical values for the parameters fitting the lattice qcd data are @xmath46 gev@xmath33 , and @xmath47 - 0.3 .",
    "the nonabelian nature of qcd makes possible for a gluon to interact with other gluons .",
    "these kind of self - interactions allow the gluonic field to be in an excited state , like it is expected to be the case in hybrid mesons .",
    "these excitations can be translated in a stringy language by computing the energy spectrum of a quantum string , the string fluctuations corresponding to the color field excitations .",
    "the string energy , and consequently the potential energy between the static quark and antiquark is then given by @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the string excitation number .",
    "let us note that the values of this number are constrained by the fact that the quantity under the square root must be positive .",
    "it is generally accepted in string theory that @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the dimension of space .",
    "together with @xmath52 , this value indeed ensures that the lorentz invariance is still present at the quantum level .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we are here dealing with effective models of qcd with @xmath53 : our string is not a fundamental object but an effective one arising from the exchanged gluons .",
    "consequently , it is clear that such an effective model could be characterized by a nonstandard value of @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , a potential model like the ssh is _ a priori _ noncovariant since the potentials which are used are instantaneous : the lorentz invariance is already broken at the classical level , so one does not need to restrict @xmath54 to the usual value . from an effective model point of view , the best interpretation to give to @xmath54 seems thus the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that it represents the zero point energy of the transverse string fluctuations . in a qcd model , this could be the zero point energy of the gluonic field .",
    "we will turn to this interpretation later , to see that it is indeed compatible with our results .",
    "let us note that for large @xmath55 , potential  ( [ pothyb ] ) is approximately equal to @xmath56 in @xmath53 , the usual string theory states that @xmath57 : we recover in this limit the well - known universal lscher term @xcite . in formula  ( [ luterm ] ) , the minimal allowed value for @xmath58 is zero . in this case",
    ", @xmath59 is expected to reproduce the funnel potential and thus represents the interaction of a quark and an antiquark in an ordinary meson .",
    "we can apply the auxiliary field formalism to compute a hybrid meson spectrum in the same way as it was done in the previous section for mesons .",
    "however , the potential to use is now given by formula  ( [ pothyb ] ) instead of the usual @xmath45 .",
    "then , the hybrid masses are given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 given by eq .",
    "( [ mass2af ] ) .",
    "because of the new term , @xmath10 is more complex to eliminate .",
    "nevertheless , we can readily compute that , in the case of a heavy hybrid meson with the quark and the antiquark of the same mass , we have @xmath62 ( the dynamical contribution of the quark and of the antiquark is neglected ) , and consequently , @xmath63 this is a kind of regge trajectory with respect to the string excitation number @xmath49 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this formula is analog to the result of eq .",
    "( [ masshl ] ) concerning the heavy hybrid mesons , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the proper rescaling @xmath38 ( these values for @xmath39 and @xmath41 will be justified in sec .",
    "[ hhh ] ) .",
    "the quantum numbers of the gluon , @xmath66 , are replaced by @xmath49 the string excitation number , and the square zero point energy of the system , @xmath67 , is now replaced by @xmath68 , the square zero point energy of the string fluctuations .",
    "this correspondence is a first hint that the description of heavy hybrid mesons in terms of a constituent gluon or of an excited string possesses a similar physical content , expressed in terms of two different degrees of freedom , namely a gluon or a string excitation .",
    "we will further investigate this correspondence in the following .",
    "in this picture , it is assumed that the excitations of the gluon field can be described by a constituent gluon interacting with the quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this pair is thus in a color octet in order for the hybrid meson to be a colorless object . assuming the casimir scaling hypothesis , which seems to be confirmed by several models @xcite , it can be shown that the confinement is no more a y - junction like in a baryon but two fundamental strings linking each quarks to the gluon @xcite . neglecting all the short - range interactions ,",
    "the three - body ssh is thus @xmath69 with @xmath70 . introducing the af",

    "@xcite , where we solved the three - body covariant oscillator quark model by an appropriate change of variables .",
    "first of all , we will replace the quark coordinates @xmath72 by @xmath73 , with the center of mass defined as @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 are two relative coordinates .",
    "the change of coordinates is made via a matrix @xmath77 , thanks to the relation @xmath78 .",
    "let us note that the invariance of the poisson brackets demands that @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "we define @xmath81 and choose to impose the constraints @xmath82 in order to have a clear physical meaning for @xmath83 , that is simply @xmath84 moreover , we ask that    [ equt ] @xmath85    constraints  ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) are consequences of the definition  ( [ cmdef ] ) : they allow the vanishing of the terms in @xmath86 and @xmath87 when hamiltonian  ( [ ham3b1 ] ) is rewritten in the new coordinates .",
    "equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) ensures that the cross product @xmath88 is equal to zero too . in the general case ,",
    "these constraints are not sufficient to eliminate the terms in @xmath89 . however , if @xmath90 , that is to say that @xmath91 and @xmath92 , these terms vanish . in what follows",
    ", we will thus restrict ourselves to the case of a quark and an antiquark with the same mass . in the center of mass frame ,",
    "@xmath93 , the hamiltonian  ( [ ham3b1 ] ) becomes @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , our transformation leads to a hamiltonian were all variables are separated . actually , we have decoupled the three - body hamiltonian  ( [ mainh ] ) into a sum of two hamiltonians : one for the two - body quark - antiquark system , the @xmath83 dependent part , and one for the gluon , the @xmath97 dependent part . to confirm this point ,",
    "let us mention that the mass term appearing with @xmath98 is the reduced mass of the quark and the antiquark , and the one appearing with @xmath99 is @xmath100 .",

    "we have in this case @xmath130 .",
    "one of the nice features of our formalism is that it is well defined for vanishing quark masses . in this case",

    "we finally obtain @xmath155 for the lightest hybrid meson .",
    "it is worth mentioning that several approaches , such as qcd in coulomb gauge @xcite , flux tube model @xcite , and lattice qcd @xcite , lead to the conclusion that the lightest hybrid meson mass is around @xmath156 gev .",
    "interestingly , this is close to the recently observed @xmath4 exotic state @xcite .",
    "however , we stress that , since our model neglects the spin interactions , the energy  ( [ elh ] ) is only a rough estimation of the lightest hybrid mass . as formula  ( [ enll2 ] ) does not involve the spin quantum numbers , its ground state ( @xmath125 ) could have the following quantum numbers @xcite @xmath157 these eight states are clearly degenerate in our approach .",
    "our estimation of the ground state mass should thus be regarded as a spin- averaged mass of the multiplet  ( [ multi ] ) .",

    "consequently , they have to be taken into account if one wants to make an accurate comparison with either lattice or experimental data .",
    "it is interesting to mention that , in the flux tube model , the lowest hybrid states can have the following quantum numbers @xcite : @xmath158 the multiplets predicted by the flux tube model and the constituent gluon approach are not identical : only six states on eight are in correspondence .",
    "the inclusion of spin interactions in both approaches would thus lead to different results , but a detailed comparison of these differences is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "after having studied the hybrid mesons as a three - body system , we would like to connect this model with a two - body description .",
    "more precisely , we would like to absorb the gluonic degree of freedom into an effective potential between the quark and the antiquark . to do this , we begin by averaging the three - body hamiltonian  ( [ ham3b2 ] ) on the gluon wave function @xmath159 .",
    "we assume that @xmath160 the first two terms are the kinetic part of a two - body ssh .",
    "consequently , the other terms are interpreted as the effective potential between the quark and the antiquark , i. e. @xmath161 this potential being still dependent of the af , we have to carefully remove them .",
    "this will be done in the two special cases we treated previously , namely the light and heavy hybrid mesons .      when @xmath162 , the potential  ( [ effpot1 ] ) only depends on @xmath10 and @xmath100 .",

    "this allows to eliminate the gluonic degree of freedom and replace it by a stringy equivalent . doing this",

    "many different states have been computed in ref .",
    "let us note that the excitation number @xmath198 used in ref .",
    "@xcite is linked to ours by @xmath210 and to the lscher number by @xmath211 .",

    "we can compare the energy levels of lattice qcd with those predicted by our model in the limit of heavy hybrid mesons ( infinite quark mass ) .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ effpot3 ] ) , the effective two - body potential in a hybrid meson is @xmath213 we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyb1 ] that the simple expression  ( [ effpot4 ] ) fits rather well the lattice data .",
    "however , this potential is a pure confinement . the simplest way to include",
    "a short range interaction is to add to @xmath169 the effective one - gluon exchange potential @xmath214 in analogy with formula  ( [ oge1 ] ) and using eq .  ( [ formu ] ) , we can approximately compute @xmath196 , and we obtain @xmath215 we expressed our results in terms of @xmath216 instead of @xmath8 since @xmath216 is the physical string tension , and it has to be used instead of @xmath8 in the wave function too . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyb2 ] , the addition of the contribution  ( [ oge3 ] ) lowers the potential energy , but the first states are still correctly described .",
    "this last result is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "( [ effpot4 ] ) with different values of @xmath109 ( dotted lines ) for a heavy hybrid meson .",
    "the parameter @xmath217 gev@xmath218 is fitted on ground state @xmath219 , with the funnel potential @xmath220 .",

    "only the confining part of the funnel potential is plotted in this figure . to clarify the graph ,",
    "only one of the four lattice states with @xmath224 was plotted.,width=302 ]     but the short - range part @xmath196  ( [ oge3 ] ) is added to @xmath169  ( [ effpot4 ] ) .",
    "@xmath225 is obtained from a fit of the funnel potential on the ground state.,width=302 ]    as our model only depends on @xmath109 , it is not able to reproduce the splittings between various potentials at short distances @xcite .",
    "however , the constituent gluon picture can provide an intuitive explanation for this fine structure .",
    "let us consider the @xmath110 state .",
    "as @xmath173 , the only possibility is @xmath226 , which corresponds to the @xmath227 state . for @xmath228 , we can only have @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "a possible mechanism to explain the short distance splitting of this state into three levels could be found in the relativistic corrections to the coulomb or the confining terms , that we neglected here . in particular ,",
    "one of these corrections is a spin - orbit term proportional to @xmath231 @xcite .",
    "consequently , for a nonvanishing value of @xmath232 ( thus of @xmath233 ) , and since the gluon is a spin @xmath234 particle , this spin - orbit term will split a level into three levels defined by their value of @xmath235 . finally , for @xmath224 , a detailed lattice study reveals four levels @xcite .",
    "we expect that one of them corresponds to @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and that the three others are @xmath229 , @xmath230 states with the spin - orbit interaction separating them . to check this point , we need to include the spin structure of the gluon into the computation of the effective potential .",
    "this can not be done analytically , and it is leaved for future works .",
    "in this work , we studied two different pictures of hybrid mesons , which are both based on a spinless salpeter hamiltonian with a linear confinement . in particular , we applied the auxiliary fields technique to obtain analytical mass formula and wave functions of our models .    the first framework describing a hybrid meson is the excited flux tube .",
    "it relies on the idea that the flux tube ( a nambu - goto string ) linking the quark and the antiquark is not in its ground state , but in an excited one due to possible quantum fluctuations of the string .",
    "the excited string approach has been widely discussed in the literature ( see for example refs .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that the interquark confining potential in this approach is of the form @xmath238 .",
    "fundamental string theory states that @xmath239 to preserve the lorentz invariance at the quantum level .",
    "however , we argued in this study that since we are dealing with an effective string theory , we should rather look at the physical content of @xmath68 . as it can be interpreted as the square zero point energy of the string fluctuations , we proposed to consider @xmath54 as the square zero point energy of the gluonic field , which is simulated in a simplified way by the string .",
    "consequently , we are led to the conclusion that the usual value of @xmath68 is not the best one for our purpose .",
    "a second picture assimilates the hybrid meson to a three - body quark - antiquark - gluon bound state .",
    "the constituent gluon is then linked to the quark and the antiquark by two fundamental strings @xcite .",
    "thanks to the auxiliary fields technique , we have been able to find an analytic expression for this three - body system in the case of heavy and light hybrid mesons . in this last case",
    ", we found for the mass scale of the lightest hybrid mesons a value close to @xmath156  gev .",
    "this is in agreement with other effective models @xcite and with lattice qcd computations @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is : how could the constituent gluon approach be reduced to a two - body model ( only the quark and the antiquark ) with an effective potential simulating the effect of the constituent gluon ? in the heavy hybrid meson sector , we showed that the effective potential has the form of the excited flux tube interaction , with the gluon quantum numbers @xmath240 corresponding to the string excitation number @xmath241 .",
    "moreover , the zero point energy of the excited flux tube , denoted as @xmath54 , is equal to the zero point energy of the heavy @xmath1 system , when the @xmath0 energy is subtracted .",
    "consequently , the constituent gluon picture is in this case equivalent to an effective string theory . in the light hybrid meson sector",
    ", the effective potential crucially depends on the quark - antiquark state , and only an asymptotic expression can be derived .",
    "this asymptotic expression is similar to the lscher term , but is now state dependent .",
    "it becomes universal only for highly excited quark - antiquark states .",
    "finally , we compared our results with lattice qcd predictions concerning the gluonic field energy levels @xcite .",
    "we find a good general agreement , but our model fails to describe the fine structure appearing at short distances .",
    "we argued that it was due to the fact that we did not take into account the gluon spin .",
    "indeed , we showed by intuitive arguments that the spin - orbit interaction of the gluon should be able to roughly explain this fine structure , at least for the first excited states .",
    "the inclusion of the spin structure of the @xmath242 system is thus a very interesting problem , which requires further investigations .",
