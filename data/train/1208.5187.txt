    "the goal of this paper is to show that logarithmic stability estimates as well as convergent numerical methods for the inverse problem of determining an initial condition in a general hyperbolic pde of the second order can be obtained without any restrictions on its coefficients , except of some natural ones . in all previous publications on this topic the principal part of the elliptic operator",

    "hence , if one would know the function @xmath3 , then one would know locations of malignant spots .",
    "the inverse problem consists in determining @xmath3 using those measurements .",
    "both stability estimates and convergent numerical methods for the problem of determining the initial condition @xmath4 in ( [ 1.01 ] ) are currently known only under some restrictive conditions imposed on the coefficient @xmath5 ( subsection 1.2 ) .",

    "we now provide a brief overview of published mathematical results for tat .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review paper .",
    "stability estimates and convergent numerical methods for an arbitrary time independent principal part @xmath42 in ( [ 1.2_1 ] ) were not obtained in the past .",
    "explicit formulas for the reconstruction of the function @xmath3 for ip1 in the case when in ( [ 1.0 ] ) @xmath43 are given in a number of publications , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these formulas lead to some stability estimates as well as to numerical methods with good performances .",
    "another approach to ip1 , ip2 is via analyzing the case when both dirichlet and neumann data are given at @xmath44 for ip1 and at @xmath45 for ip2 .",
    "an elementary , well known and stable procedure of deriving the neumann condition from the given dirichlet condition for both ip1 and ip2 is described in subsection 2.1 for the parabolic pde .",
    "a very similar procedure takes place in the hyperbolic case .",
    "consider now ip1 . since a certain norm of the neumann boundary condition at @xmath44",
    "can be estimated from the above by another norm of the data @xmath46 for @xmath47 then the problem of determining the initial condition @xmath3 can be reformulated in a slightly more general setting as the cauchy problem for equation ( [ 1.6 ] ) with the lateral dirichlet and neumann data at @xmath48 this problem consists in determining the function @xmath2 inside of the time cylinder @xmath49 .",
    "we now comment on the lipschitz stability estimate for that cauchy problem with lateral data for the particular case when initial conditions are as in ( [ 1.7 ] ) .",
    "consider the even extension of the function @xmath2 with respect to @xmath50 and do not change notations for brevity , @xmath51 let @xmath52 obviously @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 means the normal derivative .",
    "the lipschitz stability estimate for the cauchy problem with the lateral data is@xmath56 \\label{2.0}\\]]with a certain constant @xmath57 independent on the function @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the trace theorem implies the lipschitz stability estimate for the function @xmath4 with a different constant @xmath59@xmath60 .\\ ] ]    estimate ( [ 2.0 ] ) plays a fundamental role in the control theory , since it is used for proofs of exact controllability theorems . for the first time estimate ( [ 2.0 ] ) was proved in 1986 in @xcite for equation ( [ 1.0 ] ) with @xmath43 with the aim of applying to the control theory .",
    "however , the method of multipliers , which was proposed in @xcite , can not handle neither variable lower order terms of the operator @xmath7 nor a variable coefficient @xmath61 on the other hand , carleman estimates are not sensitive to lower order terms of pde operators and also can handle the case of a variable coefficient @xmath61    in @xcite the carleman estimate was applied for the first time to obtain ( [ 2.0 ] ) . in @xcite ( [ 2.0 ] ) was proved for the case of the hyperbolic equation ( [ 1.6 ] ) with @xmath62 ( _ variable lower order terms _ ) .",
    "next , the result of @xcite was extended in @xcite to a more general case of the hyperbolic inequality@xmath63 \\text { in } q_{t } ,   \\label{2.1}\\]]where @xmath64 and @xmath65 although in publications @xcite @xmath66 it is clear from them that the key idea is in applying the carleman estimate , while a specific form of the principal part of the hyperbolic operator is less important .",
    "this thought is reflected in the proof of theorem 3.4.8 of the book @xcite .",
    "thus , the lipschitz stability estimate ( [ 2.0 ] ) for the variable coefficient @xmath67 was obtained in section 2.4 of the book @xcite as well as in @xcite . in particular , in @xcite the case of an analog of the hyperbolic inequality ( [ 2.1 ] ) was considered , where @xmath68 was replaced with @xmath69 .",
    "the idea of @xcite was used in the control theory in , e.g. @xcite .    in the case of parabolic and elliptic operators ,",
    "carleman estimates are known for rather arbitrary variable principal parts @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that in the hyperbolic case the carleman estimate can be effectively analytically verified for a generic operator @xmath70 only if @xmath71 and a condition like @xmath72holds . in ( [ 1.30 ] ) @xmath73 is a certain point and @xmath74 is the scalar product in @xmath75 this is the reason why the above mentioned lipschitz stability estimates were established only using assumptions like the one in ( [ 1.30 ] )",
    ". clearly , ( [ 1.30 ] ) holds for @xmath76 .",
    "see , e.g. theorem 1.10.2 in @xcite for the proof of the carleman estimate with condition ( [ 1.30 ] ) . a more general case of condition (",
    "[ 1.30 ] ) can be found in theorem 3.4.1 of @xcite .",
    "the second way of proving lipschitz stability estimates is via imposing some conditions of the riemannian geometry on coefficients of the operator @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "publications @xcite use some modifications of the idea of @xcite ; in particular , the case of hyperbolic inequality was considered in @xcite . unlike ( [ 1.30 ] ) , conditions of the riemannian geometry",
    "can not be effectively analytically verified for an operator @xmath42 with generic coefficients , e.g. @xmath77 a slight variation of ( [ 1.30 ] ) guarantees the non - trapping condition , see formula ( 3.24 ) in @xcite .",
    "uniqueness theorems for tat were also obtained in @xcite for the case ( [ 1.0 ] ) , ( [ 1.01 ] ) .",
    "in addition , to the lipschitz stability , the quasi - reversibility method ( qrm ) for the above mentioned cauchy problem with the lateral data was developed in @xcite and numerically tested in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the originating work on qrm .",
    "the convergence of the qrm solution to the exact solution was proven on the basis of the above lipschitz stability results .",
    "numerical testing has consistently demonstrated a high degree of robustness .",
    "in particular , accurate results were obtained in @xcite with up to 50% noise in the data .",
    "some other numerical methods were proposed in @xcite .",
    "convergence of all numerical methods mentioned in this paragraph was proven only for the complete data collection case of ip1 with @xmath78 and under some restrictive conditions imposed on the function @xmath79 .",
    "first , we consider the following well known laplace - like transformation kt , lrs , which transforms the hyperbolic cauchy problem in a similar parabolic cauchy problem , @xmath80the transformation ( [ 1.10 ] ) is an analog of the laplace transform , and it is one - to - one .",
    "it is valid for , e.g. all functions @xmath81 which satisfy @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are positive constants depending on @xmath85 .",

    "denote@xmath98then@xmath99let @xmath100by theorem 5.2 of chapter iv of @xcite , ( [ 1.171 ] ) and ( [ 1.13])-([1.140 ] ) there exist numbers @xmath101 depending only on listed parameters such that@xmath102    we now describe an elementary and well known procedure of finding the normal derivative of the function @xmath96 either at @xmath103 ( in the case of ip1 ) or at @xmath104 ( in the case of ip2 ) . in the case of",
    "ip1 we solve the initial boundary value problem for equation ( [ 1.11 ] ) for @xmath105 with the zero initial condition in @xmath106 ( because of ( [ 1.5 ] ) ) and the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath107 then we uniquely find the normal derivative @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , in the case of ip2 , we uniquely find the neumann boundary condition @xmath109",
    ". estimates ( 1.14_1 ) , ( [ 1.141 ] ) ensure the stability of this procedure .",
    "therefore , each problem ip1 , ip2 is replaced with a problem for the parabolic pde ( [ 1.11 ] ) with the lateral cauchy data .",
    "these data are given at @xmath103 for ip1 and at @xmath110 for ip2 .",
    "uniqueness of the solution of each of these parabolic inverse problems follows from standard theorems about uniqueness of the continuation of solutions of parabolic pdes with the data at the lateral surface @xcite .    in stability",
    "estimates one is usually interested to see how the solution varies for a small variation of the input data .",
    "therefore , following ( 1.171 ) , ( [ 1.8 ] ) and ( [ 1.9 ] ) , we assume that in the case of ip1@xmath111and in the case of ip2@xmath112where @xmath113 is a sufficiently small number .",
    "note that it is not necessary that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the number from ( 1.171 ) .",

    "it follows from ( [ 1.144 ] ) that with a different constant @xmath120@xmath121    * remarks 2.1*.    * 1*. the number @xmath117 can be viewed as an upper estimate of the level of error in the data @xmath122 hence , theorems 2.1 , 2.2 below address the question of estimating variations of the solution @xmath4 of either ip1 or ip2 via the upper estimate of the level of error in the data .",
    "* 2*. since the kernel of the transform @xmath123 decays rapidly with @xmath124 then the condition @xmath125 in ( [ 1.8 ] ) , ( [ 1.9 ] ) is not a serious restriction from the applied standpoint .",
    "in addition , if having the data in ( [ 1.8 ] ) , ( 1.9 ) only on a finite time interval @xmath126 and knowing an upper estimate of a norm of the function @xmath4 in ( [ 1.7 ] ) , one can estimate the error in the integral ( [ 1.10 ] ) when integrating over @xmath127 this error will be small if either @xmath128 is large or @xmath50 is small in ( [ 1.10 ] ) , ( [ 1.11 ] ) .",
    "next , this error can be incorporated in the stability estimates of theorems of this section .    * 3*. another argument about @xmath129 comes from the recent experience of the author of working with time resolved real data for wave processes @xcite .",
    "the author has learned that almost all time resolved experimental data for wave processes in non - attenuating media are highly oscillatory due to some unknown processes in measurement devices , see graphs of those data in these references . because of high oscillations",
    ", these data are not governed by a hyperbolic pde even for the case of the free space , where the wave equation is supposed to work ( see the graphs of experimental data in chapters 5 and 6 of @xcite ) . therefore , the first step to make the inverse algorithm work was to preprocess the experimental data via a new data preprocessing procedure .",
    "this procedure uses only a small portion of the real data and immerses it in a specially processed data for the uniform medium .",
    "since the case of the uniform medium can be solved analytically , then there is no problem to know the immersed data for all @xmath0 since accurate imaging results were obtained in @xcite for the case of blind experimental data , then that data preprocessing procedure was unbiased .      to prove convergence of the qrm ( theorem 3.1 ) , it is convenient to consider a parabolic inequality in the integral form , which is more general than equation ( [ 1.11 ] ) . consider the function @xmath130 satisfying the following inequality @xmath131    * theorem 2.1 .",
