    "for dealing with these quasi - degeneracy problems , multi - reference ( mr ) approaches @xcite , which use a number of important reference states instead of only one in the single - reference ( sr ) approaches as the basis to build further possible excitation configurations , are usually required . in mr approaches ,",
    "the orbitals are usually taken from a multi - configurational ( mc ) self - consistent field ( mcscf ) @xcite calculations . in a most popular mc approach ,",
    "the complete active space ( cas ) self - consistent field ( casscf)@xcite method , all possible configurations in the active space are constructed , thus the quasi - degeneracy can be taken into account .",
    "thanks to the latest methodological developments @xcite , great progresses have been made for some of the challenging mr issues such as exploring the multi - radical character of one- and two - dimensional graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) @xcite and analyzing the magnetic interactions in molecules and highly correlated materials @xcite .",
    "however , the size of the active space used in casscf is usually no larger than ( 16e,16o ) due to the exponential growing of the computational cost with the number of active orbitals and electrons @xcite , and this greatly hampers the routine applications of cas - based mr approaches to the large molecular systems .    in recent years",
    ", the _ ab initio _ density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite emerges as a promising mc quantum chemical approach which can deal with active spaces larger than those by traditional cas - based methods . in the dmrg method which originated from the community of condensed matter physics by the pioneering work of white @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 eigenvectors with largest eigenvalues of the reduced density - matrix ( rdm ) of sub - systems constitute a truncated basis set for the purpose of reducing the freedom of the hilbert space .",
    "because its computational cost scales only polynomially with the number of active orbitals and the number of retained renormalized basis states @xmath1 @xcite , dmrg is nowadays regarded as an efficient alternative to the full configuration interaction ( fci ) or the cas configuration interaction ( casci ) method which has an exponential scaling . with the latest improvements of the dmrg method ( e.g. spin - adaptation @xcite , matrix - product state ( mps ) @xcite or tensor network state ( tns ) @xcite representation of the wavefunction , and the incorporation of dynamical correlations @xcite as well as the consideration of relativistic effect @xcite )",
    ", dmrg may be applied to molecular systems with exceedingly large - size cas which are completely unaffordable by traditional approaches .",
    "for example , hachmann et al .",
    "@xcite firstly illustrated the polyradical nature in higher acenes through ( 50e , 50o ) dmrg calculations , and later mizukami , et al .",
    "@xcite further extended the radical nature study to gnrs by ( 84e , 84o ) dmrg calculations and demonstrated that the mesoscopic size effect that comes into play in quantum many - body interactions of a large number of @xmath2 electrons is responsible for the polyradical nature in gnrs .",
    "very recently kurashige et al .",
    "@xcite presented the first _ ab initio _ evidence of possible non - adiabatic chemical pathways of mn@xmath3cao@xmath4 cluster in photosystem ii by virtue of ( 44e , 35o ) dmrg calculations , and sharma et al .",
    "@xcite critically examined the validity of the consensus phenomenological models of iron - sulfur clusters with the help of ( 30e , 32o ) and ( 54e , 36o ) dmrg benchmark calculations and found the widely used heisenberg double exchange model underestimates the number of states by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , it is well - known that in many cases the optimal active orbitals can not be accurately pre - identified in a simple way and accordingly the optimization of active orbital is usually required for mc and mr calculations .",
    "therefore , it is of crucial importance to perform dmrg calculations with optimized orbitals , which may be self - optimized by energy minimization , along the same lines as casscf @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could also carefully choose various molecular orbitals from other low - level electron - correlation calculations as dmrg basis @xcite .",
    "an important feature of dmrg is that it allows to capture all types of electron correlation effects ( dynamical and non - dynamical ) in a given active space in a consistent way . in many cases ,",
    "choosing a fixed number @xmath1 of preserved states in dmrg - based calculations is feasible but not economic .",
    "legeza et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a dynamical block state selection ( dbss ) protocol based on a fixed truncation error @xmath5 of the subsystem s reduced density matrix instead of using a fixed number @xmath1 of preserved states in dmrg sweeps .",
    "this approach leads to substantial gains in computational efficiency , because such a protocol can automatically adapt the computational demand of a dmrg step at a specified orbital to its special electron - correlation environment .",
    "since not every renormalized state contributes the same amount to the final energy at every point in the sweep , a fixed constant _",
    "as used in standard calculations can be a bit inefficient when dealing with very weakly occupied / unoccupied orbitals .",
    "similarly , the truncation by density - matrix threshold similarly is inefficient because a fixed density - matrix weight does not mean the same thing energetically at the ends of the sweep as at the middle .",
    "it is noticeable that the idea of  multi - level ( ml ) control of the active space \" is popular in the mc approaches @xcite , such as restricted active space self - consistent field ( rasscf ) @xcite and generalized active space ( gas)-ci / scf @xcite . in such kind of methods",
    ", the whole active space is divided into several subspaces according to their distinct electron - correlation environments , and each subspace is controlled at a different computational level .",
    "for example , gasscf calculations on the gd@xmath0 , and oxomn(salen ) complex by ma et al .",
    "@xcite showed that gas wave functions achieve the same accuracy as cas wave functions on systems that would be prohibitive at the cas level .",
    "however , whether the ml concept can be effectively applied to the dmrg method is still unknown .    in this paper",
    ", we intend to investigate the possibility and the performance of dmrg calculations using hierarchical orbital reordering of multiple active levels based on chemical intuitions , as commonly used in ras calculations .",

    "the determination of an mps wave function is a non - linear problem .",
    "however , it can be reduced to a linear problem by the sweep algorithm , by which the variational parameters in the mps wave function can be variationally determined by just iteratively optimizing one or two of the matrices @xmath12 while keeping all other matrices fixed @xcite .",
    "the mps wave function can provide both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the electronic structure , achieved by using small and large @xmath1 .",
    "the polynomial scaling ( @xmath13 ) of the computational effort ( in sweeps ) with the size of system is owned by dmrg algorithm @xcite .",

    ", we further regroup orbitals into different orbital spaces , and construct the dmrg wave function for the active space with a multiple @xmath1 treatment as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.mldmrg ] .",
    "usually the subspace , which is assigned in the middle of subspaces , should contain the most important orbitals for the purpose of maximizing the efficiency of the sweep algorithm in dmrg @xcite .        when combining ml - dmrg with orbital - optimization , a two - step procedure is implemented . at each iteration , an ml - dmrg calculation",
    "is performed first and a reference state is obtained",
    ". then it is followed by orbital - optimization process , according to the super configuration interaction ( super - ci ) scheme @xcite . with the new set of orbitals ,",
    "a new ml - dmrg iteration is performed , until there are no orbital rotations , which indicates that the ml - dmrg - scf convergence has been reached .",
    "the flowchart of ml - dmrg - scf is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.ml-dmrg-scf ] , and two types of orbital - rotation treatments are used : one is the original treatment , in which all the necessary orbital rotations are allowed ; the other is the simplified treatment , in which the orbital rotations between different active subspaces are treated as redundant .",
    "we use a locally modified version of the block program @xcite to implement the ml - dmrg calculation .",
    "when running the ml - dmrg - scf calculations , we use a development version of the molcas package @xcite , which contains a molcas - dmrg interface .",
    "this molcas - dmrg interface supports block and maquis @xcite qc - dmrg packages .",
    "the single point calculations by dmrg - casci / scf , ml - dmrg(-scf ) , and geometry optimizations can be implemented using this interface .",
    "the casscf , rasscf calculations of pec of n@xmath0 are implemented by molpro.2010 @xcite , and all the other calculations are implemented by the development version of molcas package .",
    "firstly , we investigate the numerical accuracy of the ml - dmrg on the water molecule with a ano - rcc - vdzp basis . in this example , the core orbitals and the valence orbitals are chosen as the high - level orbitals ( 10e , 7o ) and the remaining orbitals are chosen as the low - level orbitals ( 17o ) . in the ml - dmrg calculations , the number of preserved state ( _ m _ ) is fixed to 3000 when sweeping among high - level orbitals and the _ m _ value is range from 1 to 300 when sweeping among low - level orbitals . for comparisons",

    "it can be seen that the accuracy of ml - dmrg is gradually improved with the increasing _",

    "if only 1 preserved state is used in low - level subspace , ml - dmrg can reproduce the result of casci in only the high - level subspace .",
    "it means that only the non - dynamical correlation in the high - level subspace is considered , while there is no dynamical correlation of low - level subspace being involved . when increasing the number of preserved states that used in low - level subspace , one would find that ground - state energy decreases gradually , and finally the energy value ( -76.3267187 hartree , @xmath1=300 in low - level subspace ) is even lower than that of ccsd(t ) ( -76.3265256 hartree ) , and it is quite close to that of standard dmrg calculation using _ _",
    "m__=3000 ( difference is about 0.0005 hartree ) .",

    "secondly , we extend the active space to all the orbitals of n@xmath0 molecule with further partition of orbital levels , in order to reveal the capacity and behavior of ml - dmrg when dealing with large active spaces ( around 60 orbitals ) . the n@xmath0 molecule in both equilibrium geometry ( 1.0@xmath21 , @xmath21=1.0976 ) and near dissociation geometry ( 3.0@xmath21 ) with cc - pvtz basis are used .",

    "when implementing ml - dmrg calculations , the numbers of preserved states in different subspaces are kept by the proportion of 0.25:1:0.5:0.25 .",
    "it is clearly shown that , for moderate energy accuracy criterion ( no less than 10@xmath22 hartree ) ml - dmrg calculations can have noticeable efficiency gain over standard dmrg calculations with fixed @xmath1 values ( fig .",
    "[ fig.n2_mldmrg ] ) .",
    "one may also notice that the dbss strategy with @xmath5=1.0@xmath23 has significant computational speed advantages for low energy accuracy ( around 10@xmath24 hartree ) calculations , which save more than 50% computational time .",
    "however , more accurate dbss - dmrg calculations with @xmath5=1.0@xmath25 can be easily out of the capability of current computational resources and hardly give converged results because it usually requires too many states to be kept ( more than 10000 , see fig .",
    "s1a @xcite ) . under such circumstances , using fixed @xmath1 value or the ml strategy will be a computational advantage for dmrg calculations .",
