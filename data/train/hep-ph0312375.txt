    "we note that in we were able , using string techniques , to derive a number of fundamental perturbative and non perturbative properties for supersymmetric qcd such as the beta function , fermion condensate as well as chiral anomalies .",
    "recently in @xcite we constructed effective lagrangians of the veneziano - yankielowicz ( vy ) type for two non - supersymmetric but strongly interacting theories with a dirac fermion either in the two index symmetric or two index antisymmetrix representation of the gauge group .",
    "these theories are planar equivalent , at @xmath3 to sym @xcite . in this limit",
    "the non - supersymmetric effective lagrangians coincide with the bosonic part of the vy lagrangian .",
    "we departed from the supersymmetric limit in two ways .",
    "first , we considered finite values of @xmath4 . then @xmath5 effects break supersymmetry .",
    "we suggested the simplest modification of the vy lagrangian which incorporates these @xmath5 effects , leading to a non - vanishing vacuum energy density .",

    "second , we added a small fermion mass term which breaks supersymmetry explicitly .",
    "the vacuum degeneracy is lifted , the parity doublets split and we evaluated this splitting . the @xmath8-angle dependence and its implications were also investigated .",
    "this new effective lagrangian provides a number of fundamental results about qcd which can be already tested either experimentally or via lattice simulations .",
    "this new type of expansion in the inverse of number colors in which the quark representation is the two index antisymmetric representation of the gauge group at any given @xmath4 may very well be more convergent then the ordinary @xmath5 expansion . in the ordinary case one",
    "keeps the fermion in the fundamental representation of the gauge group while increasing the number of colors .",
    "indeed recently in @xcite we have studied the dependence on the number of colors ( while keeping the fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group ) of the leading pi pi scattering amplitude in chiral dynamics .",
    "we have demonstrated the existence of a critical number of colors for and above which the low energy pi pi scattering amplitude computed from the simple sum of the current algebra and vector meson terms is crossing symmetric and unitary at leading order in a @xmath5 expansion .",
    "the critical number of colors turns out to be @xmath9 and is insensitive to the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "this means that the ordinary @xmath5 corrections for the real world are large .      at nonzero temperature",
    "the center of the @xmath10 gauge group becomes a relevant symmetry @xcite .",
    "however except for mathematically defined objects such as polyakov loops the physical states of the theory are neutral under the center group symmetry .    a new class of effective lagrangians have been constructed to show how the information about the center group symmetry is efficiently transferred to the actual physical states of the theory and will be reviewed in detail elsewhere . via these lagrangians",

    "i will focus here on the two basic effective lagrangians developed for color superconductivity .",
    "more specifically the lagrangian for the color flavor locked phase ( cfl ) of qcd at high chemical potential and the 2 flavor color superconductive effective lagrangian .",
    "[ uno ] a color superconducting phase is a reasonable candidate for the state of strongly interacting matter for very large quark chemical potential .",
    "many properties of such a state have been investigated for two and three flavor qcd . in some cases these results rely heavily on perturbation theory , which is applicable for very large chemical potentials . some initial applications to supernovae",
    "explosions and gamma ray bursts can be found in @xcite and @xcite respectively , see also @xcite . the interested reader can find a discussion of the effects of color superconductivity on the mass - radius relationship of compact stars in @xcite",
    "for @xmath11 light flavors at very high chemical potential dynamical computations suggest that the preferred phase is a superconductive one and the following ansatz for a quark - quark type of condensate is energetically favored : @xmath12 a similar expression holds for the right transforming fields .",
    "the greek indices represent spin , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote color while @xmath15 and @xmath16 indicate flavor .",
    "the condensate breaks the gauge group completely while locking the left / right transformations with color .",
    "the final global symmetry group is @xmath17 , and the low energy spectrum consists of @xmath18 goldstone bosons .",
    "here we seek insight regarding the relevant energy scales of various physical states of the color flavor locked phase ( cfl ) , such as the vector mesons and the solitons @xcite .",
    "our results do not support the naive expectation that all massive states are of the order of the color superconductive gap , @xmath19 .",
    "our strategy is based on exploiting the significant information already contained in the low  energy effective theory for the massless states .",
    "we transfer this information to the massive states of the theory by making use of the fact that higher derivative operators in the low  energy effective theory for the lightest state can also be induced when integrating out heavy fields . for the vector mesons ,",
    "this can be seen by considering a generic theory containing vector mesons and goldstone bosons . after integrating out the vector mesons ,",
    "the induced local effective lagrangian terms for the goldstone bosons must match the local contact terms from operator counting .",
    "we find that each derivative in the ( cfl ) chiral expansion is replaced by a vector field @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 this relation allows us to deduce , among other things , that the energy scale for the vector mesons is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vector meson mass .",
    "our result is in agreement with the findings in .",
    "we shall see that this also suggests that the ksrf relation holds in the cfl phase .    in the solitonic sector ,",
    "the cfl chiral lagrangian gives us the scaling behavior of the coefficient of the skyrme term and thus shows that the mass of the soliton is of the order of @xmath24 which is contrary to naive expectations .",
    "this is suggestive of a kind of duality between vector mesons and solitons in the same spirit as the duality advocated some years ago by montonen and olive for the @xmath25 georgi - glashow theory @xcite .",
    "this duality becomes more apparent when considering the product @xmath26 which is independent of the scale , @xmath19 . in the present case , if the vector meson self - coupling is @xmath27 , we find that the skyrme coefficient , @xmath28 , can be identified with @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the following relations hold : @xmath29 in this notation the electric - magnetic ( i.e. vector meson - soliton ) duality is transparent . since the topological wess - zumino term in the cfl phase is identical to that in vacuum , we identify the soliton with a physical state having the quantum numbers of the nucleon .",
    "we expect that the product of the nucleon and vector meson masses will scale like @xmath30 for any non - zero chemical potential for three flavors .",
    "interestingly , quark - hadron continuity can be related to duality @xcite . testing this relation",
    "can also be understood as a quantitative check of quark - hadron continuity .",
    "it is important to note that our results are tree level results and that the resulting duality relation can be affected by quantum corrections .",

    "this point , however , is not relevant for the validity of our results .",
    "when going beyond the lowest - order term in derivatives , we need a counting scheme . for theories with only one relevant scale ( such as qcd at zero chemical potential ) , each derivative is suppressed by a factor of @xmath43 .",
    "this is not the case for theories with multiple scales . in the cfl phase",
    ", we have both @xmath43 and the gap , @xmath19 , and the general form of the chiral expansion is @xcite : @xmath46 following @xcite , we distinguish between temporal and spatial derivatives .",
    "chiral loops are suppressed by powers of @xmath47 , and higher - order contact terms are suppressed by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the momentum .",
    "thus , chiral loops are parametrically small compared to contact terms when the chemical potential is large .",
    "there is also a topological term which is essential in order to satisfy the thooft anomaly conditions at the effective lagrangian level .",
    "it is important to note that respecting the thooft anomaly conditions is more than an academic exercise .",
    "in fact , it requires that the form of the wess - zumino term is the same in vacuum and at non - zero chemical potential .",
    "its real importance lies in the fact that it forbids a number of otherwise allowed phases which can not be ruled out given our rudimentary treatment of the non - perturbative physics . as an example , consider a phase with massless protons and neutrons in three - color qcd with three flavors . in this case",
    "chiral symmetry does not break .",
    "this is a reasonable realization of qcd for any chemical potential .",

    "hence , the integral must be performed over a five - dimensional manifold whose boundary ( @xmath54 ) is ordinary minkowski space . in the constant @xmath55 has been shown to be the same as that at zero density , i.e. @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of colors ( three in this case ) . due to the topological nature of the wess - zumino term",
    "its coefficient is a pure number .",

    "for example , dropping the dimensionless field @xmath37 , the operator with two derivatives becomes a mass operator for the vector meson @xmath77 this demonstrates that the vector meson mass gap is proportional to the color superconducting gap .",

    "one finds that the classical solitonic mass is , up to a numerical factor : @xmath91 and the isoscalar radius , @xmath92 .",
    "interestingly , due to the non perturbative nature of the soliton , its mass turns to be dual to the vector meson mass .",
    "it is also clear that although the vector mesons and the solitons have dual masses , they describe two very distinct types of states .",
    "the present duality is very similar to the one argued in @xcite . indeed , after introducing the collective coordinate quantization , the soliton ( due to the wess - zumino term ) describes baryonic states of half - integer spin while the vectors are spin one mesons . here , the dual nature of the soliton with respect to the vector meson is enhanced by the fact that , in the cfl state , @xmath93 is expected to be substantially reduced with respect to its value in vacuum .",

    "one has to show the emergence of a singularity ( i.e. a pole structure ) .",
    "this pole is then interpreted as due to a goldstone boson when chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "one might be worried that , since the chemical potential explicitly breaks lorentz invariance , the gapless ( goldstone ) pole may disappear modifying the infrared structure of the three point function .",
    "this is not possible .",
    "thanks to the nielsen and chadha theorem @xcite , not used in @xcite , we know that gapless excitations are always present when some symmetries break spontaneously even in the absence of lorentz invariance . since the quark chemical potential is associated with the barionic generator which commutes with all of the non abelian global generators the number of goldstone bosons must be larger or equal to the number of broken generators . besides all of the goldstones must have linear dispersion relations ( i.e. are type i @xcite ) .",
    "this fact not only guarantees the presence of gapless excitations ( justifying the analysis made in @xcite on the infrared behavior of the form factors ) but demonstrates that the pole structure due to the gapless excitations needed to saturate the triangle anomaly is identical to the zero quark chemical potential one in the infrared .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the explicit dependence on the quark chemical potential is communicated to the goldstone excitations via the coefficients of the effective lagrangian ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "for example @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath45 in the high chemical potential limit and the low energy effective theory is a good expansion in the number of derivatives which allows to consistently incorporate in the theory the wess - zumino - witten term @xcite and its corrections .",
    "the validity of the anomaly matching conditions have far reaching consequences . indeed , in the three flavor case",
    ", the conditions require the goldstone phase to be present in the hadronic as well as in the color superconductive phase supporting the quark - hadron continuity scenario @xcite . at very high quark chemical potential the effective field theory of low energy modes ( not to be confused with the goldstone excitations ) has positive euclidean path integral measure @xcite . in this limit",
    "the cfl is also shown to be the preferred phase with the aid of the anomaly conditions .",
    "since the fermionic theory has positive measure only at asymptotically high densities one can not use this fact to show that the cfl is the preferred phase for moderate chemical potentials .",
    "this is possible using the anomaly constraints .    while the anomaly matching conditions are still in force at nonzero quark chemical potential @xcite the _ persistent mass _ condition @xcite ceases to be valid .",
    "indeed a phase transition , as function of the strange quark mass , between the cfl and the 2sc phases occurs .",
    "we recall that we can saturate the thooft anomaly conditions either with massless fermionic degrees of freedom or with gapless bosonic excitations .",
    "however in absence of lorentz covariance the bosonic excitations are not restricted to be fluctuations related to scalar condensates but may be associated , for example , to vector condensates @xcite .",
