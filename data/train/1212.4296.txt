    "the luminosity of the milky way is dominated by its disk , where the great majority of stars ( @xmath2 ) are found . by comparison , out of @xmath3 stars in the milky way , the stellar halo comprises only a tiny fraction ( @xmath4 ) , but this component is a precious source of information on the formation history of the galaxy .",
    "first , halo stars are very old ( @xmath5 ) , and their chemical compositions provide information on the ancient environments in which these stars formed .",
    "typically , the metal abundances of halo stars are less than 1/10th of the solar value @xcite , which immediately suggests that the metal enrichment due to supernova explosions in the universe had not progressed very far when halo stars were formed .",
    "secondly , the stellar halo is a collisionless system , hence two - body relaxation is expected to be unable to fully erase the initial orbital properties of halo stars .",
    "it follows that the present motions of halo stars reflects their motions in the early universe , which can be used to explore the kinematics of their progenitor systems , such as the gas clouds or dwarf galaxies in which these halo stars formed .    to date ,",
    "detailed analyses of the chemical and dynamical properties of halo stars has been confined to stars up to @xmath6 from the sun ( centered at the galactocentric distance of the sun , @xmath7 ) , although the spatial distribution of the stellar halo extends to @xmath8 or more .",
    "this is mainly because we do not possess sufficiently accurate measurements of proper motions for more distant halo stars . in order to avoid this limitation",
    ", many authors have studied the line - of - sight velocities and spatial distribution of halo stars , making use of various kinematic models  such as distribution function models of the stellar halo , or gravitational potential models of the milky way . however , the conclusions of previous studies on the orbital distribution of halo stars well outside the local region are divergent .",
    "some suggest tangentially - anisotropic orbital distributions @xcite , others suggest radially - anisotropic distributions @xcite , and still others suggest nearly isotropic distributions @xcite",
    ". this might imply that the stellar halo is not a simple entity which can be described by a single distribution function model .",
    "indeed , based on observations of relative nearby ( @xmath9 ) halo stars , @xcite suggest that a dual - halo model is more appropriate , in which the stellar halo consists of a relatively metal - rich inner - halo component with a net zero to slightly prograde rotation , and a very metal - poor outer - halo component with a net retrograde rotation .",
    "recent observations of retrograde outer - halo rr lyrae stars by @xcite , and a model - fitting analysis for distant halo stars by @xcite supports this idea , as do recent numerical simulations of the formation of milky way - like galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we introduce a new analysis of the halo system , which requires only a minimum of assumptions , and does not require any kinematic models .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our sample selection and expected errors in distance , line - of - sight velocities , and metallicities .",
    "section 3 describes our analysis approach . in section 4",
    ", we examine the application of this technique to our sample of halo bhb stars , segregated on metallicity .",
    "section 5 presents a brief discussion and conclusions .",
    "our sample comprises 1865 blue horizontal - branch ( bhb ) stars from data release 8 of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , with galactocentric distances in the range @xmath10 , as originally selected and carefully validated by @xcite .",
    "this sample is free from significant contamination by the sagittarius stream and the thick disk , as we apply a spatial masking scheme in their selection .",
    "distances from the sun are accurate to @xmath11 , and the line - of - sight velocity errors are @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "stellar metallicities , [ fe / h ] , for this sample are also available . following @xcite , we use the metallicities obtained by the @xcite methodology in the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ; see @xcite for details ) , which are likely to be the most reliable for stars with effective temperatures of bhb stars ( on the order of 0.3 dex ) .",
    "we then divide this sample on metallicity  994 of our stars are relatively metal - rich ( @xmath13}>-2.0 $ ] ) , while 871 stars are very metal - poor ( @xmath1 } < -2.0 $ ] ) . }",

    "let us denote by @xmath14 an imaginary observer located at the sun who is at rest with respect to the galactic rest frame , and by @xmath15 an observer located at the sun who moves with the sun . here",
    ", we assume that the velocity of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath14 , @xmath16 , and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) position of the sun with respect to the galactic center are known .    now",
    ", suppose that the @xmath17-th star ( @xmath18 ) is observed in the direction of @xmath19 by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "then , the line - of - sight velocity with respect to @xmath14 can be expressed as :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the velocity of this star with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "since the line - of - sight velocity of this star with respect to @xmath15 is :    @xmath22    we can calculate @xmath23 from ( @xmath24 ) .    on the other hand , if we decompose @xmath21 as :    @xmath25    we obtain    @xmath26    where    @xmath27    here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are the @xmath31-th velocity component of the @xmath17-th star , and the basis unit vectors of the spherical coordinate system at the position of the @xmath17-th star , respectively .    given the assumptions :    * ( a1 ) there is no correlation between the velocity and position of a star * ( a2 ) the distributions of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are symmetric around @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively    then the data points @xmath38 are likely to be distributed around a linear function of form :    @xmath39    thus , by performing a linear fit to the data in the @xmath40 plane , we can obtain @xmath41  by which we denote the estimated value of @xmath42  by measuring the slope of the best - fit linear function .",
    "this approach is similar to that of @xcite .      in estimating the velocity dispersion",
    ", we use a modified version of the approach used by @xcite . in principle",
    ", this method utilizes the direction dependence of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",

    "throughout this paper , we assume that the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is on a circular orbit with a rotation speed of @xmath60 @xcite . it is worth noting that our assumed values for the galactocentric distance of the sun , @xmath61 , and the circular velocity of the lsr are both consistent with two recent independent determinations of these quantities by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "have recently determined , on the basis of accurate line - of - sight velocities for stars in the apogee sub - survey of sdss - iii , that the circular velocity of the lsr is close to @xmath60 .",
    "we also assume that the peculiar motion of the sun with respect to the lsr is @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the determination of mean rotational velocity , @xmath42 , for the relatively metal - rich ( red ) and very metal - poor ( blue ) bhb samples , as a function of galactocentric distance , @xmath56 .",
    "the shaded regions indicate the uncertainties in each result , estimated from a bootstrap approach ( sampling with replacement ) .",
    "inspection of this figure suggests that @xmath42 at @xmath63 is a slightly decreasing function of @xmath56 for the relatively metal - rich sample , while that for the very metal - poor sample is more or less flat .",
    "the relatively more metal - rich sample is in modest prograde rotation , with @xmath64 , while the very metal - poor sample is in retrograde motion , with @xmath65 , and lags that of the relatively metal - rich sample by @xmath66 , similar to previous observations of stars in a much more local sample by @xcite , the outer - halo analysis based on distribution - function fitting @xcite , and some recently simulated stellar haloes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also intriguing to see that the rotational shear between two samples seems to shrink at @xmath67 .",
    "we confirm that varying the lsr velocity only changes the absolute value of @xmath42 , and that the very metal - poor sample _ always _ lags behind the relatively metal - rich sample , independent of the assumed lsr velocity .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows determinations of the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath43 , and the two components of the tangential velocity dispersion , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for the relatively metal - rich and very metal - poor samples , as a function of @xmath56 . as seen in the figure , @xmath43 is about @xmath68 , and exhibits a declining behavior over @xmath69 for both samples , supporting most previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , this figure suggests that @xmath70 holds for the very metal - poor sample . noting that the gravitational potential is nearly spherical well above the disk plane , and that @xmath42 of the very metal - poor stars is small compared with its velocity dispersion",
    ", it follows that they obey a distribution function that depends mainly on the orbital energy and angular momentum @xcite , and thus their spatial distribution is nearly spherical .",
    "the different behavior of the 3d velocity dispersions for the two samples implies that both the functional form of the distribution function and spatial distribution for these samples are different .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the velocity anisotropy parameter , @xmath71 .",
    "this parameter quantifies the relative dominance of the radial and tangential velocity dispersions , and provides a simple diagnostic of the orbital properties of our sample stars .",
    "if @xmath72 takes on values @xmath73 , we can infer that the halo stars are dominated by round orbits , while if @xmath74 , we can infer that the halo stars are dominated by radial orbits .",
    "when @xmath72 is ( nearly ) zero , we can infer that the velocity distribution is ( nearly ) isotropic .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] suggests that relatively metal - rich bhb stars are dominated by radial orbits at @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , while the very metal - poor bhb stars are dominated by circular orbits over @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) . a similar trend in the eccentricity distribution",
    "is also confirmed in the more local sample of halo stars reported by @xcite , in which very metal - poor halo stars possess a higher fraction of low - eccentricity orbits ( see their figure 5 ) .",
    "the observed systematic differences in the orbital motions of the relatively metal - rich and very metal - poor bhb stars suggest that the orbital motion of the progenitor systems of the stellar halo depends on their metal abundances . noting that dwarf galaxies with smaller total stellar masses tend to have lower metal abundances ( @xcite , and references therein ) , which can be understood as a result of a smaller rate of metal - enrichment events such as supernova explosions",
    ", our findings suggest that low - gas - fraction ( ` star - rich ' ) systems tend to move in radial orbits , while high - gas - fraction ( ` gas - rich ' ) systems tend to move in round orbits when they convert their gas to stars .    in the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario , the milky way ( and other large systems ) attains its mass as a result of the mergers of infalling smaller systems @xcite . due to the deep gravitational potential",
    "well of the milky way , these infalling systems tend to have radial orbits @xcite . at this stage",
    ", we expect that the orbital properties of infalling systems is independent of whether they are star - rich or gas - rich",
    ". however , the situation may be different when such radially infalling systems pass near the galactic center .",
    "in such a region , star - rich systems ( e.g. , massive dwarf galaxies with low gas fractions ) are expected to be disrupted by tidal interactions , which give rise to field halo stars with radial orbits @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gas - rich systems are expected to interact with other gas - rich systems , and lose some orbital energy via dissipational processes @xcite . if the angular momentum of such a gas - rich system is approximately conserved , the orbit is circularized , and the pericentric distance ( distance of closest approach to the galactic center ) increases . once its pericentric distance",
    "become sufficiently large to avoid the central region of the milky way , further orbital change becomes less likely , since encounters with other gas - rich systems becomes less probable .",
    "therefore , gas - rich systems tend to move in round orbits . when the galactic disk forms , some gas - rich systems with similar orbital motions to disk gas may be absorbed into the disk , due to their small relative velocities , while others remain moving on orbits across the halo , and eventually form field halo stars with round orbits .",
    "if the total orbital angular momentum of gaseous systems is initially near zero , these halo stars would exhibit a net retrograde rotation with respect to disk stars .",
    "some gas - rich systems in the milky way that have not yet formed many stars might be associated with the observed high - velocity clouds @xcite .    in the solar neighborhood , observations suggest that @xmath79 for halo stars , almost independent of metal abundance ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , as overplotted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "combined with our result , we see that the motion of the relatively metal - rich bhb stars move on radial orbits at @xmath80 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with recent cosmological simulations in which most halo stars originate from accreted dwarf galaxies @xcite , as also overplotted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "however , our very metal - poor halo bhb stars suggest a transition from radially - anisotropic to tangentially - anisotropic velocity distributions .",
    "the existence of very metal - poor outer - halo stars with round orbits , which is not confirmed in simulated stellar haloes , suggests that current simulations of disk galaxy formation may lack some important mechanisms , such as those proposed in the previous paragraph .",
    "we here note that many authors have pointed out that the simulated dwarf galaxies show an over - production of stars , when compared with observed dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is often called the `` overcooling problem '' , and this might result in underestimation of the gas - rich progenitors in simulated haloes , which in turn underestimate the numbers of metal - poor halo stars with round orbits .",
    "we find that the kinematics of outer - halo stars exhibit a marked dependence on stellar metal abundance , which provides information about the physical properties of their progenitor systems ( such as the gas fraction ) . both of our main results , that the relatively metal - rich and very metal - poor stars are dominated by radial and round orbits , respectively , and that the mean rotational velocity of very metal - poor halo stars lags that of relatively metal - rich halo stars , can be explained if very metal - poor stars originate from gas - rich systems and metal - rich stars from star - rich systems .",
    "our findings cast a new light on the formation mechanism of the milky way and similar disk galaxies .",
