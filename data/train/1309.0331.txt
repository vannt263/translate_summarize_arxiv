    "is enhanced to @xmath3 and it acts as a `` superatom '' @xcite . with this idea ,",
    "a saturable single photon absorber is designed for the manipulation of photon - matter interactions @xcite .",
    "the underlying physics behind _ blockade sphere _ is _ rydberg blockade mechanism _ , which was first proposed to control quantum logic gate and generate nonclassical photonic states @xcite . in recent years",
    "many experimental achievements prove the observation of single - atom collective excitation induced by the rris in ultracold mesoscopic ensembles @xcite as well as in two atoms @xcite .",
    "a significant reduction of the blockade size due to the doppler effect is observed in room temperature atomic samples @xcite and can be overcome with a pulsed four - wave mixing scheme @xcite .",
    "these observations hold promises for further studies in quantum information science by using strongly interacting rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "to characterize such a _ sphere _ , defining a good blockade radius is a key ingredient by which we can classify the whole blockade regimes into strong blockade , partial blockade and non - blockade regimes according to the relative strengths between the rri energy and the linewidth of excitation .",
    "so far , a large number of experiments and theoretical works are performed in the strong blockade regime @xcite where a perfect blocked phenomenon for the doubly excited state population is identified @xcite and the formation of plasmas due to an ionization avalanche is observed @xcite .",
    "more recently , l. bguin _",
    "_ report a direct measurement of the van der waals ( vdws ) interaction between two rydberg atoms in the partial blockade regime in which the population oscillations exhibit several vdws energy - dependent frequencies rather than single collective rabi frequency @xcite . in order to investigate quantum dynamics in such strong blockade and partial blockade regimes",
    ", one always adopts a spherical - shaped model with its volume @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 ( typically a few microns ) defined as the interatomic distance at which the vdws interaction equals the excitation linewidth of single atom @xcite .",
    "this spherical shape assumption is robust under the condition of mean two - atom distance being significantly smaller than @xmath5 in a superatom , i.e. the case of strong blockade ; however , if they two become comparable in the partial blockade regime , we predict that the spherical surface would become deformed , leading to an inefficient rydberg blockade .    in a recent work , t. pohl and p. berman show that the two - atom rydberg blockade will break down when the number of atoms increases from two to three @xcite .",
    "here , we propose an alternative opinion to extend this model by introducing the blockade sphere picture . the purpose of this work is to investigate the spatially anisotropic deformations of rydberg blockade sphere in a three - atom system where the deformation strength is well determined by the two - atom distance . for non - interacting or strongly interacting atoms ,",
    "the two - atom blockade sphere picture is a feasible tool to characterize and even optimize the blockade efficiency for multi - atom ensembles .",
    "however , for partial blockade , the coherent atomic excitations behave much complex , which makes the simple two - atom blockade sphere model ineffective . in addition to the complete analytical results of a two - atom system",
    ", we numerically solve the master equations for three atoms and represent various deformed surfaces in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) space .",
    "besides , we develop an optimal antiblockade condition in few - atom systems , which is also useful for multiple atom ensembles .",
    "let us first recall the essence of a simple two - atom blockade scheme with the rri @xmath6 .",
    "see the caption of fig . [ model ] for a detailed scheme description .",
    "when two atoms are in the double rydberg state @xmath7 , they interact strongly due to the vdws interaction , leading to an interatomic distance - dependent energy shift by @xmath8 [ @xmath9 throughout the paper ] . for the shifted energy that is larger than the laser excitation linewidth ,",
    "the laser transition is out of resonance and only one of two atoms ( e.g. atom 1 ) would be transferred to the rydberg state at a time , resulting in very low doubly excited state population for rydberg atoms .",
    "this is so - called _ rydberg blockade _ _ effect _ @xcite .    to demonstrate the blockade efficiency quantitatively , a picture of _ blockade sphere _ with radius @xmath5",
    "is considered to be very useful . within the sphere ,",
    "only single - atom excitation is allowed if the mean interatomic distance is much smaller than @xmath5 ; hence , we require a good definition of @xmath5 . for two atoms confined in a sphere , there are two ways to define it :    \\(i ) the easiest way to estimate @xmath10 ( subscript @xmath11 means the atomic number ) relies on the model of a single laser - driven atom excited to rydberg state with its linewidth dominated by the power broadening @xmath12 [ @xmath12 is single - photon rabi frequency for two - level atoms and effective two - photon rabi frequency for three - level atoms ] , so that @xmath10 is defined as the interatomic distance at which the interaction energy equals the linewidth of excitation , @xmath13    for a @xmath1-atom ensemble , a collective blockade radius is @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) another generalized way uses the steady - state population @xmath15 of a single atomic rydberg state under cw laser drivings that is @xmath16 to estimate its linewidth @xmath17 ( clearly @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the corresponding radius @xmath19 takes the form of @xmath20    so far , to our knowledge estimating blockade radius by the properties of single atom excitation has been the unique and robust way @xcite .",
    "however , a full theoretical description of this laser - driven , strongly interacting multi - atom system is still challenging . on the purpose of improving the understandings for two - atom rydberg blockade , we suggest a new definition for radius by directly solving the master equations of two interacting atoms @xcite : @xmath21   + \\mathcal{l}\\left [   \\hat{\\rho}\\right ]   $ ] , with the hamiltonian @xmath22 describing the atom - field interaction as well as the vdws interaction , the lindblad operator @xmath23   $ ] for the spontaneous decay process . then the steady - state population @xmath24 for double rydberg state @xmath7",
    "is given by @xmath25    in the case of @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( [ double_popu ] ) reduces into @xmath27 , showing a lorentzian function of @xmath28 with the two - atom excitation linewidth @xmath29 ( clearly @xmath30 ) . in a similar way",
    ", we are able to define a new blockade radius , as@xmath31{\\frac{c_{6}}{w_{2}}}=\\left (   \\frac { c_{6}\\sqrt{16\\omega^{2}+\\gamma^{2}}}{8\\omega^{2}+\\gamma^{2}}\\right )   ^{1/6}. \\label{new_rad}\\ ] ]    from the definitions of radius @xmath10 , @xmath19 and @xmath32 , we note @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "[ model](c ) , we observe that they all show a slowly decreasing as @xmath12 increases and @xmath32 persists slightly smaller than @xmath10 and @xmath19 . @xmath10 and @xmath19 have a perfect overlap if @xmath34 except for very small @xmath12 values [ see the inset of fig .",
    "[ model](c ) ] . by then",
    ", the blockade efficiency can be roughly quantified by the radius , i.e. a strong blockade regime is defined by the two - atom distance @xmath35 being significantly smaller than the blockade radius . for a large @xmath12 ,",
    "the blockade effect is weaker .    according to the results of most experiments e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , they need the mean interaction distance being smaller than the blockade radius by several orders of magnitude i.e. @xmath36 for the study of strong blockade effect , so that such differences between @xmath10 , @xmath37 and @xmath32 may be negligible ; however , when working in the partial blockade regime where @xmath38 , they may become important for the results , owing to its sensitive dependence of double excitation probability on the interatomic distance as well as rabi frequency @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we use @xmath32 to represent the two - atom blockade radius .",
    "equation ( [ double_popu ] ) also provides us a new route to investigate the antiblockade efficiency . as first predicted by c. ates _",
    "_ @xcite and later experimentally verified by t. amthor _",
    "@xcite , the antiblockade effect is a specific effect with high doubly excited state population in the blockade regime when the laser detuning matches the rydberg - rydberg interaction energy .",
    "it can emerge for instance if the rri energy shift equals the two - photon detuning based on the autler - townes splitting mechanism in an atomic three - level system . according to the concept of antiblockade",
    ", the two - atom antiblockade condition can be written as @xmath39 , leading to the steady - state population @xmath24 @xmath40 where the antiblockade radius @xmath41 is @xmath42    as shown in fig .",
    "[ model](c ) , compared with the blockade radius , the antiblockade radius @xmath41 ( denoted by solid black line ) is small than @xmath32 and has the same tendency as the blockade radius for @xmath12 changes .    finally , we conclude that inside the blockade sphere , once the antiblockade condition is met , the probability for double rydberg excitation will be strikingly enhanced ; beyond the sphere regime , the role of rri is poor which makes the blockade mechanism invalid , so both high single - atom and multi - atom excitation probabilities are possible . to observe obvious two - atom antiblockade behavior",
    ", we suggest the interatomic distance @xmath43 as well as the condition @xmath44 is met .",
    "the _ blockade sphere _ picture is identified to be robust when demonstrating the two - atom blockade experiments @xcite , which has extended to a @xmath1-atom ensemble with one excited atom , so - called `` superatom '' @xcite . on the other hand , while increasing the real number of atoms from two to three , the three - atom excitation dynamics would show an unexpected and qualitative change .",
    "this idea was considered in an isosceles triangle configuration @xcite near frster resonance interactions @xcite .    in the present section ,",
    "our goal is to develop a generalized model of a three - atom system in a 2d space , for the purpose of studying spatially anisotropic deformation of blockade sphere due to the presence of atom 3 .",
    "the assumption of a spherical - type blockade surface is widely accepted , which gives rise to a clear picture for rydberg studies .",
    "we show that this assumption is exactly correct only if the separation @xmath35 is much smaller than the blockade radius , otherwise , the blockade surface is no longer a spherical shape .",
    "our model is depicted in fig .",
    "[ model](b ) .",
    "atoms 1 and 2 are initially prepared on @xmath45 axis with a fixed distance @xmath35 and its central point @xmath46 describing the original point of coordinate system . in the same space ,",
    "there exists atom 3 whose position is defined as @xmath47 with @xmath48 the distance from @xmath46 point and @xmath49 the directional angle with respect to @xmath50 axis . then the interatomic separations @xmath51 ( atom 1 and atom 3 ) and @xmath52 ( atom 2 and atom 3 ) can be expressed as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "differing from a two - atom system where only interaction @xmath28 plays roles , such a three - atom scheme offers a feasible platform to study both interactions and quantum interference from three different energy channels @xmath28 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , authors consider one type of configuration : an isosceles triangle . when the third atom is brought closer to the atomic pair , by tuning the laser pulse duration and laser amplitude , a significant increase for the double rydberg excitation",
    "is observed .",
    "the reason for this increase we think essentially comes from the shrunken of blockade surface due to the multi - channel quantum interference .    in our numerical explorations , for relative low rydberg levels ( e.g. @xmath57 ) ,",
    "the vdw coefficient is @xmath58mhz @xmath59m@xmath60 @xcite , which for @xmath61mhz and @xmath62mhz gives the blockade radius @xmath63 m .",
    "we note that this value is even smaller than the collective blockade radius for three atoms based on the former definition [ @xmath64 m ] . besides ,",
    "to perform the calculations more efficiently , we make two assumptions : ( i ) if atom 3 is placed too close to atoms 1 or 2 , the interaction @xmath65 ; in this case , we treat it as a two - atom problem where the critical distance for @xmath66 is chosen as @xmath67 m ( @xmath68 m is the characteristic wavelength of light needed for internal - state manipulation @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) by directly solving the three - atom master equations",
    "@xmath69 + \\mathcal{l}\\left [   \\hat{\\rho}\\right ]   $ ] , we define a new quantity @xmath70 to describe the probability of simultaneously exciting any two of three atoms to rydberg states . in a polar coordinate system ,",
    "the three - atom blockade radius @xmath71 is numerically determined by @xmath72 .",
    "when separation @xmath73 , @xmath74 attains its maximum for non - blockade regimes and when @xmath75 , @xmath74 is minimal for strong blockade regimes .    in fig .",
    "[ deformation](a ) , the red arrow points to the direction of an increasing two - atom distance @xmath35 along which the steady - state population @xmath24 undergoes a continuous transition from low excitations ( @xmath76 , black ) to the saturated excitations of two - level atoms ( @xmath77 , white ) .",
    "the green circle denotes the two - atom blockade surface .",
    "[ deformation](b)-(d ) are graphed in the 2d polar coordinate @xmath78 of atom 3 .",
    "when atom 3 presents , the original two - atom blockade sphere ( solid green circle ) reveals different strengths of deformations , which strongly depend on the two - atom distance @xmath35 [ see dashed white circles ] . from ( b ) to ( d ) by respectively choosing @xmath79 m , 2@xmath59 m and 3@xmath59 m , we find the three - atom blockade spheres turn to be radius - reducing long elliptical shape .",
    "the clear shrunken property of the sphere surface makes the blockade effect more difficult in a three - atom ensemble than in a two - atom one .",
    "we also find the two - atom distance @xmath35 has a significant role in the three - atom blockade .",
    "compared to @xmath32 , the smaller @xmath35 is , the less broken or deformed of blockade surface is observed while adding the third atom . because in this case , interactions @xmath55 and @xmath56 are always smaller or comparable with @xmath28 [ see fig . [ deformation](b ) ] . by contrast ,",
    "when @xmath35 is close to @xmath32 , three different interaction channels result in strong quantum interference effect , yielding a strong deformed surface [ see fig .",
    "[ deformation](d ) ] .    based on our numerical results ,",
    "it is interesting to find the deformation effect in a three - atom system shows spatially anisotropic properties that the deformed surface becomes a long ellipse rather than a circle or an oblate ellipse . to demonstrate this finding",
    ", we consider two extreme cases : ( i ) a 1d chain of atoms with @xmath80 , ( ii ) an isosceles triangle with @xmath81 . in case ( i ) , when atom 3 is closing to the atomic pair from @xmath50 axis , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ; in case ( ii ) , when atom 3 is coming from @xmath84 axis , @xmath85 . for given @xmath35 and @xmath48",
    ", we note that @xmath86 .",
    "a complete asymmetric excitation property for a chain model creates a larger deformation strength than for a symmetric isosceles triangular model ; so that if @xmath35 is small @xmath87 , a long elliptical - shape surface is not so clear compared with a large @xmath35 case .",
    "another interesting result is for two - atom distance @xmath88 that is comparable with @xmath32 , as shown in fig .",

    "we think this is a regime for partial blockade behavior ( i.e. imperfect blockade ) which usually appears at the boundary of the region of finite size @xcite .      in section ii.b",
    ", we study the two - atom antiblockade and obtain a quantified antiblockade radius @xmath41 for optimizing its efficiency .",
    "that is the interatomic distance @xmath35 should be @xmath91 , beyond this regime , if @xmath92 , the antiblockade is inefficient ; otherwise if @xmath93 , both single and double rydberg states will be populated . in this section",
    ", we take a three - atom system as an example to explore a generalized antiblockade condition form for multi - atom systems .    in a three - atom system , we predict the antiblockade condition to be @xmath94 @xcite with @xmath95 the rri between any two atoms @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "first , we assume @xmath35 is fixed as well as @xmath99 , so that by changing the position of atom 3 , it is possible to meet two resonant conditions : @xmath100 and @xmath101 for a given detuning @xmath102 .    in fig .",
    "[ antiblockade_pic](a ) , for a given detuning ( @xmath103mhz ) and two - atom distance ( @xmath104 m ) , we show the antiblockade trajectory as two circles ( blue and red ) whose centers locate at atom 1 and atom 2 and radius is @xmath105 m , respectively to meet the resonant conditions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we select five points on two trajectories and plot their excitation probabilities @xmath74 as a function of distance @xmath48 in fig .",

    "[ deformation](c ) , we note that points a , b , d are within the regime of deformed blockade sphere that render the excitation probability @xmath111 .",
    "however , for points c and e , @xmath74 exceeds @xmath112 due to the imperfect antiblockade near the boundary of blockade surface .",
    "in addition , we also find that except for @xmath113 and @xmath114 that is a symmetric triangular structure ( e.g. point a ) , for other angles @xmath49 there exist two distinguishable antiblockade resonances , locating at @xmath115    second , we introduce another picture to study the antiblockade excitation properties .",
    "figure [ antiblockade_pic](c ) shows the double excitation probability @xmath74 by varying detuning @xmath102 .",

    "this finding agrees well with the two - atom case . while , at the side of negative detuning or zero detuning values , @xmath123 is mostly suppressed , which strongly verifies that the generalized antiblockade condition @xmath126 is correct .",
    "in summary , we thoroughly study the rydberg blockade and antiblockade effects in two- and three - atom systems . starting from a typical two - atom blockade sphere model",
    ", we quantify the two - atom blockade and antiblockade efficiency by introducing more rigorous definitions for the radius , based on theoretically solving the two - interacting - atom master equations . when turning to the three - atom case , we observe that the spherical surface would occur strong spatial anisotropic deformation with a reduced radius which is sensitive related to the mean interatomic distance .",
    "this fact renders the blockade effect more difficult to achieve in a three - atom system than in a two - atom one .",
    "the anisotropy property stems from the asymmetric rydberg - rydberg interactions for atoms 1 , 3 and atoms 2 , 3 .",
    "in addition , we also numerically investigate a generalized antiblockade condition in a three - atom system and show the double rydberg excitation properties are importantly affected by the blockade and antiblockade boundaries .",
    "on the one hand , our results are consistent with a collective blockade radius @xmath127 for a superatom scheme which implies that @xmath128 will reduce if we increase the atomic number @xmath1 ; on the other hand , the idea that the deformation of blockade sphere is spatially anisotropic is brightly new and may stimulate new explorations for rydberg experiments in various 2d optical lattices in the future .",
