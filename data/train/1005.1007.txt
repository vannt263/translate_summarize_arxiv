    "despite recent scepticism concerning early announcements of the discovery of exotic strange baryon @xmath0 two collaborations diana and leps confirmed their original results @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to recent experimental reviews @xcite . in this article following @xcite",
    "we assume that @xmath1 exists with a mass equal 1540 mev and total width @xmath2 mev .",
    "an immediate consequences is the existence of the whole exotic su(3 ) multiplet : @xmath3 .",
    "apart from truly exotic states antidecuplet contains cryptoexotic nucleon- ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5-like states ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the interpretation of these states is not well understood : one may try to associate them with some known resonances , or one may postulate the existence of new resonances with nucleon or @xmath5 quantum numbers .",
    "this is the approach which we adopt here @xcite . following refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite we assume that there exists new , narrow nucleon resonance @xmath7 which we will interpret as a member of @xmath3 .",
    "if so , @xmath8 decays have to satisfy the following constraints @xcite originally discussed in @xcite:@xmath9 unfortunately the small partial width of @xmath7 to @xmath10 contradicts su(3 ) symmetry relations between the decay constants of @xmath8 .    in this short note",
    "we would like to emphasize the importance of mixing both for decays and mass spectra of the putative exotic antidecuplet baryons .",
    "the exotic states have been already anticipated by the founders of the quark model although they did not elaborate on them .",
    "later the arguments have been raised that they should be heavy and wide .",
    "in contrast , chiral soliton models predicted that the pentaquark masses were generically small ( _ i.e. _ in the range of 1.51.6 gev ) @xcite .",
    "it was much more difficult to accommodate the small decay width of @xmath1 @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ decaywidths ] we explain how small decay width arises naturally in the chiral soliton quark model ( @xmath11qsm ) .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "[ gmo ] we argue that the decay coupling @xmath12 is further reduced due to gell - mann  okubo ( gmo ) mixing caused by the nonzero @xmath13 . in sect .",
    "[ rmixing ] we show how additional mixing of @xmath3 with roper octet can change decay patterns of @xmath14 .",
    "we estimate allowed range of mixing angles and present predictions for remaining members of @xmath3 : @xmath6 and @xmath15 .",
    "conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "in in ref .   @xcite the following nonrelativistic formula for the decay width has been used : @xmath16 it follows from the goldberger - treimann relation between axial and strong decay constants . here",
    "@xmath17 is the mass of the decaying baryon , @xmath18 the mass of the decay product and @xmath19 is the outgoing meson momentum .",
    "generically @xmath20 given by ( [ gammadef ] ) would be still in the range of a few hundreds of mev @xcite if not for the terms non - leading in @xmath21 expansion .",
    "indeed , even without mixing the decay constant @xmath22 , which stands for the matrix element of the tensor decay operator @xmath23 between the physical baryon wave functions @xmath24:@xmath25 is the sum of three different contributions that are formally of different order in @xmath21 .",
    "however , they are multiplied by the su(3 ) clebsch - gordan coefficients that also depend on @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "for example : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "similarly@xmath29 chiral soliton models provide us with specific predictions for constants @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "had we neglected @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eqs.([gtnk],[gdnpi ] ) ( which would be inconsistent for @xmath12 because of @xmath26 enhancement of @xmath31 ) we would have obtained for @xmath33:@xmath34 estimating @xmath35 from the experimental value of @xmath36 decay width , and consequently@xmath37 we see that small decay width of @xmath1 results from the cancelation in ( [ gtnk ] ) .",
    "indeed , the authors of ref . @xcite have shown that in the nonrelativistic limit of @xmath11qsm one obtains that @xmath38 with @xmath39 and consequently @xmath40 ! in the same limit @xmath11qsm predicts that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it follows that antidecuplet decay constants are small .",
    "treating @xmath13 corrections as perturbation introduces mixing @xcite@xmath43 where subscripts refer to spin .",
    "for some specific states mixing constants @xmath44 may be equal zero due to the isospin .",
    "for example @xmath1 mixes only with @xmath45 , but this component of the wave function does not contribute to the decays to octet .",
    "therefore only mixing of the final nucleon with @xmath3 and @xmath46 modifies the decay constant:@xmath47 ^{2}. \\label{gtnkmix}%\\ ] ] since @xmath48 is small the admixtures proportional to the reduced matrix elements@xmath49 are important even if mixing parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not large ( for definitions see ref .",
    "neither @xmath52 nor @xmath53 vanish in the nonrelativistic limit . therefore in this limit @xmath1 decay",
    "occurs entirely due to the mixing . for realistic model parameters",
    "( when @xmath54 ) there is a cancelation ( note that @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) between different terms in ( [ gtnkmix ] ) and @xmath12 is further suppressed . mixing affects decay patterns of pentaquarks violating su(3 ) relations between the decay constants @xmath22 @xcite .    on somewhat more phenomenological ground",
    "let us consider only @xmath57 mixing @xcite defining@xmath58 which can be directly extracted from ( [ gammadef ] ) if @xmath59 is known . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath60 mev , hence @xmath61 .",
    "it is then possible to express decay constants of other members of antidecuplet in terms of measurable physical parameters such as @xmath62 mixing angle @xmath63 and one a priori unknown parameter @xmath64 which can be estimated from @xmath11qsm calculations . here",
    "we take @xmath65 @xcite",
    ". then we have for example:@xmath66    if we want to interpret @xmath7 as @xmath8 we need to satisfy bounds ( [ conditions ] ) .",
    "this is quite difficult within one angle scenario .",
    "it is possible to nullify @xmath67 by a suitable choice of mixing angle @xmath68 , but then the mean octet mass ( i.e. the nucleon mass before mixing ) which is experimentally @xmath69 mev comes out wrong @xcite:@xmath70 the mixing angle that satisfies ( [ conditions ] ) is order of magnitude too small to account for baryon masses . for realistic mixing angles @xmath67 is dominated by @xmath71 and @xmath72 in contradiction with experimental data for @xmath7 .",
    "in order to satisfy conditions ( [ conditions ] ) with more realistic mixing angles we have considered in ref .",
    "@xcite scenario in which exotic antidecuplet can mix with roper resonance octet ( mixing angle @xmath73 ) . for roper octet gmo mass formulae work with much worse accuracy than for the ground state octet @xcite , so there is a need for additional mixing . since @xmath74 @xcite roper decay to @xmath75 is negligible",
    ". however roper admixture contributes to @xmath76 and other decay modes:@xmath77 since @xmath78 is comparable with @xmath71 one may suppress @xmath67 without changing much @xmath79 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have found that conditions ( [ conditions ] ) are satisfied in the vicinity of the line @xmath80 we see that mixing angles are reasonable .",
    "the decay widths and branching ratio to @xmath75 along ( [ or_lin ] ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoangles ]     to @xmath10 ( long dashed red line ) in mev together with branching ratio ( short dashed blue line ) of @xmath81 as functions of mixing angle @xmath63 along the line ( [ or_lin ] ) .",
    "thin vertical lines correspond to the limits on the mixing angle @xmath63 .",
    "the plot is made for @xmath82 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gn10bar ] we plot @xmath67 and @xmath83 together with their different components along the line ( [ or_lin ] ) .",
    "we see that indeed @xmath67 is small due to the cancellation between @xmath71 and @xmath84 , while @xmath85 rises moderately when mixing increases .",
    "( solid lines ) with different components defined in eq .",
    "( [ gn10bar ] ) shown by dashed lines .",
    "the plot is made for @xmath82.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( solid lines ) with different components defined in eq .",
    "( [ gn10bar ] ) shown by dashed lines .",
    "the plot is made for @xmath82.,title=\"fig : \" ]    having established the range of mixing angles we can predict masses of the remaining antidecuplet members @xcite:@xmath86 note that bound ( [ xirange ] ) contradicts the result of na49 @xmath87  mev @xcite . from our analysis",
    "it follows that total decay width of @xmath15 to @xmath88 and @xmath89 is of the order of 10 mev .",
    "total width of @xmath6 does not exceed 30 mev but is also constrained from below to be larger that 10 mev .",
    "most prominent decay channels are @xmath90 and @xmath91 with branching ratios approximately 60% and 20% respectively . due to the mixing su(3 ) forbidden decays to decuplet are possible , but small , at the level of 5 to 9% .",
    "mixing induced by @xmath13 was first studied within the @xmath11qsm already in ref . @xcite but only in the leading order in @xmath26 .",
    "it was extended to nonleading terms in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . mixing apears also in other approaches to pentaquarks .",
    "for example in a diquark model @xcite antidecuplet mixes with an accompanying cryptoexotic octet .",
    "diagonalization of strangeness induces _ ideal _ ( large ) mixing between these two representations .",
    "the resulting physical states of nucleon quantum numbers have been interpreted as roper and @xmath92 .",
    "however due to the ideal mixing these two states should have comparable widths @xcite , while experimentally they are differ substantially .",
    "the discussion of masses and decay widths of the @xmath93 states under assumption that they correspond to the roper and @xmath94 done in ref .",
    "@xcite still indicates that it is impossible to match the mass splittings with the observed branching ratios for these two resonances even for arbitrary mixing .",
    "whether any different assignment of the diquark @xmath93 states would be compatible with the decay patterns deserves a separate study .    in this short note",
    "we have argued that due to the smallness of the reduced matrix elements of @xmath95 , which is natural in chiral soliton models , mixing with other su(3 ) representations has to be taken into account .",
    "unfortunately , for the time being we can only speculate which mixing scenario is phenomelogically impossible , allowed or desired .",
    "here we have examined a possibility that antidecuplet mixes with the roper octet .",
    "mixing of roper and the ground state octets is presumably very small . indeed",
    "the first order gmo mass formulae work very well for the ground state octet so there is almost no space for additional mixing .    * acknowledgements * this paper is based on a common work with maxim polyakov and klaus goeke .",
