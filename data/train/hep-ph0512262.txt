    "the large top quark mass  @xcite suggests that it may play a special role in ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "new physics connected with ewsb may thus be found first in top quark precision observables . a possible signal for new physics is a deviation of the any of the @xmath11 , @xmath4 or @xmath12 couplings from the values predicted by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "for example , in technicolor and other models with a strongly coupled higgs sector  @xcite , and in little higgs models  @xcite , anomalous top quark couplings may be induced at the @xmath13 level .",

    "future collider experiments offer many possibilities to probe the ew top quark couplings . the most promising ones with respect to the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) couplings are provided by an @xmath17 linear collider via @xmath18  @xcite , and the lhc via @xmath19 production  @xcite .    at an @xmath17 linear collider operating at @xmath20  gev and with an integrated luminosity of @xmath21  fb@xmath22",
    ", one could measure the @xmath15 couplings in top pair production with a few - percent precision  @xcite .",
    "however , the process @xmath23 is sensitive to both @xmath11 and @xmath4 couplings simultaneously , and significant cancellations between the various couplings can occur . at hadron colliders ,",
    "@xmath2 production is so dominated by the qcd processes @xmath24 that a measurement of the ew neutral couplings via @xmath25 is hopeless .",
    "instead , they can be measured in qcd @xmath26 production and radiative top quark decays in @xmath2 events ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "each of the processes is sensitive to the ew couplings of only the boson emitted : @xmath5 and photon independently .",
    "this obviates having to disentangle potential cancellations between the different couplings . in these three processes",

    "@xcite we presented a detailed analysis of @xmath19 production at hadron colliders .",
    "we found that while the @xmath11 couplings can be measured at the lhc with a precision of typically a few percent , the bounds on the @xmath4 couplings are a factor @xmath28 weaker , in particular for the vector and axial vector couplings , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a major factor which limits their sensitivity is the relatively small cross section for @xmath0 production when one requires the @xmath5 boson to decay leptonically ( where we mean @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) throughout ) , as in our previous analysis .    in this paper , we extend our @xmath0 analysis to the case where the @xmath2 pair decays hadronically and the @xmath5 boson decays into neutrinos . due to the larger branching ratio for @xmath1 relative to leptonic decays , this effectively triples the number of events which can be utilized ,",
    "thus our present analysis may significantly improve the limits on anomalous @xmath4 couplings .",
    "however , the increased statistics comes at the price of a background which is potentially much larger than the signal . after reviewing the definition of the @xmath4 couplings , we present a detailed discussion of the signal and all relevant backgrounds ( sec .

    "the most general lorentz - invariant vertex function describing the interaction of a @xmath5 boson with two top quarks can be written in terms of ten form factors  @xcite , which are functions of the kinematic invariants . in the low energy limit , these correspond to couplings which multiply dimension - four or -five operators in an effective lagrangian , and may be complex . if the @xmath5 boson couples to effectively massless fermions , the number of independent form factors is reduced to eight .",
    "in addition , if both top quarks are on - shell , the number is further reduced to four . in this case , the @xmath4 vertex can be written in the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the proton charge , @xmath37 is the top quark mass , @xmath38 is the outgoing top ( anti - top ) quark four - momentum , and @xmath39 .",

    ", a linear collider will thus be able to significantly improve the sensitivity limits expected from the lhc , even when the @xmath79+@xmath34 channel is included and assuming 3000  fb@xmath22 from the slhc .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this picture could change once cancellations between different non - standard @xmath4 couplings , and between @xmath11 and @xmath4 couplings , are allowed . while beam polarization at an @xmath17 collider would provide a very powerful tool to disentangle the effects of different couplings , unfortunately no realistic studies on the simultaneous measurement of couplings in @xmath186",
    "have been performed so far .      as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec1 ] , the @xmath4 couplings may deviate substantially from their sm values in little higgs ( lh ) models . here",
    "we explore how their measurement at the lhc may constrain parameter space in the @xmath187 littlest higgs model with t - parity  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath4 vector and axial vector couplings are modified by mixing of the left - handed top quark and a heavy top quark partner , @xmath188 .",
    "one finds @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the @xmath191 coupling ( @xmath192 is the higgs boson ) , @xmath193  gev is the sm higgs vacuum expectation value , and @xmath194 is the @xmath188 quark mass .",
    "( [ eq : lh ] ) and the log likelihood function can be used to derive lower @xmath195 cl limits for @xmath196 : @xmath197 for comparison , current ew precision data require @xmath198  gev  @xcite .",
    "we thus expect the slhc will be able to improve this bound , while the lhc should be able to discover a @xmath188 quark with a mass of @xmath199  tev with 300  fb@xmath22 of data  @xcite .",
    "if a @xmath188-quark candidate were found , a measurement of @xmath144 would be valuable in helping to pin down @xmath190 .    in lh models without t - parity ,",
    "anomalous @xmath4 couplings may receive additional contributions from mixing of the @xmath57 and @xmath5 bosons with a heavy @xmath200 triplet of vector bosons , @xmath201 and @xmath202 , which are characteristic for lh models  @xcite .",
    "however , constraints from precision ew data severely restrict these additional contributions .",
    "currently , little is known about top quark couplings to the @xmath5 boson",
    ". there are no direct measurements of these couplings ; indirect measurements , using lep and slc data , tightly constrain only the @xmath4 vector and axial vector couplings .",
    "the @xmath4 couplings could be measured directly in @xmath183 at a future @xmath17 linear collider .",
    "however , such a machine is at least a decade away .",
    "in addition , the process @xmath183 is simultaneously sensitive to @xmath11 and @xmath4 couplings , and significant cancellations between various couplings may occur .    in this paper , we considered @xmath0 production with @xmath1 and @xmath123+@xmath34 at the lhc as a tool to measure @xmath4 couplings . at the tevatron ,",
    "the @xmath0 cross section is too small to be observable .",
    "when the @xmath5 boson decays leptonically , the small @xmath116 branching ratio is one of the main factors which limits the achievable sensitivity to anomalous @xmath4 couplings .",
    "the larger @xmath1 branching ratio ( relative to @xmath116 ) effectively triples the number of signal events and thus has the potential to significantly improve the sensitivity to non - standard couplings .",
    "we calculated the signal cross sections taking into account all top quark - resonant feynman diagrams .",
    "all relevant background processes were included in estimating limits on the couplings .",
    "once @xmath0 selection cuts are imposed , the background drops significantly faster with missing transverse momentum than the signal , and for @xmath148  gev the signal dominates .",
    "the largest background source is @xmath8 production , where one of the top quarks decays semi - leptonically and the charged lepton is lost . in all our calculations we assumed that both @xmath71 quarks are tagged , to bring the backgrounds to a controllable level .",
    "our analysis reveals that the achievable sensitivity limits utilizing final states where the @xmath5 decays leptonically  @xcite can be improved by @xmath10 when the @xmath79+@xmath34 mode is taken into account .",
    "the improvement is particularly pronounced for the @xmath4 axial vector coupling @xmath144 which can be measured with a precision of @xmath203 at the luminosity - upgraded lhc ( 3000  fb@xmath22 ) .",
    "measuring @xmath144 with such precision will make it possible constrain the parameter space in little higgs models which predict deviations of the @xmath4 vector and axial vector couplings of up to @xmath167 .",
