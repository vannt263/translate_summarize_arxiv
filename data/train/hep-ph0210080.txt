    "the pion transition form factor , the simplest exclusive quantity , offers an excellent testing ground for qcd . for large virtualities of the photons ( or at least for one of them ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is applicable @xcite .",
    "a specific feature of this process is that the leading - order ( lo ) prediction is zeroth order in the qcd coupling constant , and one expects that pqcd for this process may work at accessible values of spacelike photon virtualities .",
    "the pion transition form factor @xmath0 is defined in terms of the amplitude @xmath1 @xmath2 and for large - momentum transfer @xmath3 , it can be represented @xcite as a convolution @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for the usual convolution symbol ( @xmath6 ) . in ( [ eq : tffcf ] ) , the function @xmath7 is the hard - scattering amplitude for producing a collinear @xmath8 pair from the initial photon pair ; @xmath9 is the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) representing the probability amplitude for finding the valence @xmath8 fock state in the final pion with the constituents carrying fractions @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the meson s total momentum @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the factorization ( or separation ) scale at which soft and hard physics factorize . in this standard hard - scattering approach",
    ", pion is regarded as consisting only of valence fock states , transverse quark momenta are neglected as well as quark masses .    the hard - scattering amplitude @xmath14 is obtained by evaluating the @xmath15 amplitude , and has a well  defined expansion in @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being the renormalization ( or coupling constant ) scale of the hard - scattering amplitude .",
    "thus , one can write @xmath18    the process - independent function @xmath19 is intrinsically nonperturbative , but it satisfies an evolution equation of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the perturbatively calculable evolution kernel . if the distribution amplitude @xmath22 is determined at an initial momentum scale @xmath23 ( using some nonperturbative methods ) , then the differential - integral evolution equation ( [ eq : eveq ] ) can be integrated using the moment method to give @xmath19 .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the pion transition form factor takes the form @xmath24    the choice of the expansion parameter represents the major ambiguity in the interpretation of the perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "we see that the coupling constant @xmath16 , as well as , the coefficients @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) from ( [ eq : fgammapiexp ] ) , depend on the definition of the renormalization scale and scheme .",
    "the truncation of the perturbative expansion at any finite order causes the residual dependence of the prediction on the choice of the renormalization scale and scheme , and introduces the theoretical uncertainty . if one can optimize the choices of the scale and scheme according to some sensible criteria , the size of the higher - order correction as well as the size of the expansion parameter , i.e. the qcd running coupling constant , can then serve as sensible indicators of the convergence of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the simplest and widely used choice ( the justification for the use of which is mainly pragmatic ) , is to take the @xmath17 scale equal to characteristic momentum transfer of the process , i.e. in our case @xmath27 .",
    "but since each external momentum entering an exclusive reaction is partitioned among many propagators of the underlying hard - scattering amplitude , the physical scales that control these processes are inevitably much softer than the overall momentum transfer .",
    "several scale setting procedure were proposed in the literature @xcite . in the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm )",
    "procedure @xcite , all vacuum - polarization effects from the qcd @xmath28-function are resummed into the running coupling constant . according to blm procedure ,",
    "the renormalization scale best suited to a particular process in a given order can be , in practice , determined by computing vacuum - polarization insertions in the diagrams of that order , and by setting the scale demanding that @xmath29-proportional terms should vanish .",
    "the optimization of the renormalization scale and scheme for exclusive processes by employing the blm scale fixing was elaborated in @xcite .",
    "the renormalization scales in the blm method are physical in the sense that they reflect the mean virtuality of the gluon propagators and the important advantage of this method is `` pre - summing '' the large ( @xmath30)@xmath31 terms , i.e. , the infrared renormalons associated with coupling constant renormalization ( @xcite and references therein ) .    in our recent work @xcite we have determined the blm scale for the pion transition form factor , i.e. , for the @xmath32 process .",
    "the lo prediction for the pion transition form factor is zeroth order in the qcd coupling constant , the nlo corrections @xcite represent leading qcd corrections and the vacuum polarization contributions appearing at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) were needed to fix the blm scale from from the requirement @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the @xmath29-proportional nnlo term from ( [ eq : fgammapiexp ] ) .    in this work",
    "we outline important points of this calculation and present the results that follow from the consistent calculation up to @xmath29-proportional nnlo contributions to both the hard - scattering and the distribution amplitude .",
    "we first outline the calculational procedure and its ingredients which are illustrated in fig . [",
    "f : fpida ] .",
    "the @xmath35 amplitude denoted by @xmath36 contains collinear singularities , and it factorizes as @xmath37 here , @xmath13 denotes a factorization scale at which the separation of collinear singularities takes place , and all collinear singularities are factorized in @xmath38 , since @xmath39 is , by definition , a finite quantity .    on the other hand , a process - independent distribution amplitude for a pion in a frame where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is defined @xcite as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a path - ordered factor making @xmath45 gauge invariant .",
    "the unrenormalized pion distribution amplitude @xmath46 given in ( [ eq : phiopi ] ) and the distribution amplitude @xmath47 renormalized at the scale @xmath13 are related by a multiplicative renormalizability equation @xmath48    by convoluting the `` unrenormalized '' ( in the sense of collinear singularities ) hard - scattering amplitude @xmath49 with the unrenormalized pion distribution amplitude @xmath46 , given by ( [ eq : tthz ] ) and ( [ eq : phizphi ] ) , respectively , one obtains @xmath50 the divergences of @xmath49 and @xmath46 cancel @xmath51 and the usual expression ( [ eq : tffcf ] ) emerges .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the scale @xmath13 representing the boundary between the low- and high - energy parts in ( [ eq : tffcf ] ) is , at same time , the separation scale for collinear singularities in @xmath49 , on the one hand , and the renormalization scale for uv singularities appearing in @xmath46 , on the other hand .",
    "we note also that the pion distribution amplitude as given in ( [ eq : phiopi ] ) , with @xmath52 being the physical pion state , of course , can not be determined using perturbation theory .",
    "we can write @xmath46 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is obtained from ( [ eq : phiopi ] ) by replacing the meson state @xmath52 by a @xmath55 state composed of a free quark and antiquark .",
    "the amplitude @xmath56 can be treated perturbatively , making it possible to investigate the high - energy tail of the pion da , to obtain @xmath57 and to determine the da evolution .",
    "we proceed to calculation .",
    "this is the first calculation of the hard - scattering amplitude @xmath49 of an exclusive process with the nnlo terms taken into account .",
    "the subtraction ( separation ) of collinear divergences at the nnlo is significantly more demanding than that at the nlo .",
    "owing to the fact that the process under consideration contains one pseudoscalar meson , the calculation is further complicated by the @xmath58 ambiguity related to the use of the dimensional regularization method to treat uv and collinear divergences .",
    "the consistent calculation of @xmath36 and @xmath56 enable us to resolve these problems and , hence , we have calculated the lo , nlo , and @xmath29-proportional nnlo contributions to the perturbative expansions of both the hard - scattering amplitude and the perturbatively calculable part of the distribution amplitude .",
    "the dependence of pion distribution amplitude @xmath19 on @xmath59 is specified by the evolution equation ( [ eq : eveq ] ) .",
    "this dependence is completely contained in the evolutional part @xmath60 @xmath61 which satisfies the evolutional equation @xmath62 while @xmath63 represents the nonperturbative input determined at the scale @xmath64 .    by differentiating ( [ eq : tffcf ] ) with respect to @xmath13 and by taking into account ( [ eq : eveq ] ) , one finds that the hard - scattering amplitude satisfies the evolution equation @xmath65 which is similar to ( [ eq : eveq ] ) .",
    "the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath66 can be , analogous to ( [ eq : phifvphi ] ) , factorized in the function @xmath67 as @xmath68 using ( [ eq : vfv ] ) one can show by partial integration that ( [ eq : tthfv ] ) indeed represents the solution of the evolution equation ( [ eq : eveqt ] ) .    by substituting ( [ eq : phifvphi ] ) and ( [ eq : tthfv ] ) in ( [ eq : tffcf ] ) , we obtain @xmath69 where @xmath70 has been taken into account .",
    "it is important to realize that the expression ( [ eq : fvfvfv ] ) is valid at every order of a pqcd calculation , and this can be easily shown ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the factorization scale @xmath13 disappears from the final prediction at every order in @xmath71 and therefore does not introduce any theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the crucial point is that both the resummation of @xmath72 terms in @xmath45 as well as the resummation of @xmath73 terms in @xmath39 , have to be performed using ( [ eq : phifvphi ] ) and ( [ eq : tthfv ] ) along with the results from ( [ eq : vfv ] ) .",
    "we note here that by adopting the common choice @xmath74 , we avoid the need for the resummation of the @xmath73 terms in the hard - scattering part , making the calculation simpler .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the complete analytical expressions for the pion transition form factor calculated up to @xmath29 proportional nnlo terms .     scheme ( and the usual one - loop formula for @xmath71 with @xmath75 gev@xmath76).,height=207 ]    the prediction for the pion transition form factor and the blm scale @xmath77 depend on the form of the distribution amplitude .",
    "there is increasing theoretical evidence coming from different calculations @xcite that the low energy pion distribution amplitude does not differ much from its asymptotic form .",
    "the expression for the pion transition form factor @xmath78 corresponding to the asymptotic distribution reads @xmath79          + \\cdots \\right\\ }              \\ , , \\quad \\label{eq : numresas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is a flavour factor , while @xmath81 gev .",
    "the @xmath29-proportional nnlo contribution determines the value of the blm scale @xmath82 one notes that this scale is considerably softer than the total momentum transfer @xmath83 , which is consistent with partitioning of @xmath83 among the pion constituents .",
    "the nlo predictions obtained in the @xmath84 scheme are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : numascz ] .",
    "the predictions based on the asymptotic da are , in contrast to the ones obtained using the cz da @xcite , in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the rather low blm scale given in ( [ eq : blmas ] ) , and consequently the large @xmath85 , questions the applicability of the perturbative prediction at experimentally accessible momentum transfers .",
    "the nlo predictions obtained assuming the asymptotic da and the blm scale ( [ eq : blmas ] ) satisfy the requirement @xmath86 for @xmath87 gev@xmath76 .",
    "this reliability limit is indicated on fig .",
    "[ f : numascz ] .",
    "the transition to the more physical @xmath88 scheme , may offer a way out of this problem .",
    "scheme ( @xmath89 gev@xmath76).,height=207 ]    in @xcite the exclusive hadronic amplitudes were analysed in the @xmath88 scheme , in which the effective coupling @xmath90 is defined from the heavy - quark potential @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath88 scheme is a natural , physically based scheme , which by definition automatically incorporates vacuum polarization effects into the coupling .",
    "the @xmath92 scale reflects the mean virtuality of the exchanged gluons .",
    "if use is made of the scale - fixed relation between the couplings @xmath93 and @xmath88 @xcite then , to the order we are calculating , the nlo prediction in the @xmath88 scheme is obtained by taking @xmath94 , i.e. for the asymptotic da @xmath95 the nlo prediction for @xmath78 obtained in @xmath88 scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : numv ] . as can be seen",
    ", it is in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "we note that , since @xmath88 is an effective running coupling defined from the physical observable , it must be finite at low momenta , and the appropriate parameterization of the low - energy region should in principle be included ( see @xcite for various proposals ) .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed the determination of the nlo blm scale for the pion transition form factor .",
    "a consistent calculation of both the hard - scattering and the perturbatively calculable part of the pion distribution amplitude has been performed up to @xmath29-proportional nnlo terms .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the prediction for the pion transition form factor is independent of the factorization scale @xmath13 at every order in the strong coupling constant @xmath71 .",
    "provided both the hard - scattering and the distribution amplitude are treated consistently regarding their @xmath13 dependence , the factorization scale disappears from the final prediction at every order in @xmath71 without introducing any theoretical uncertainty .",
    "one can use @xmath96 to simplify the calculation , but any other choice would lead to the same result .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath17 fixed according to the blm scale setting prescription within the @xmath84 scheme and corresponding to the asymptotic pion distribution amplitude , turns out to be @xmath97 .",
    "thus , in the region of @xmath98 gev@xmath76 , in which the experimental data exist , @xmath99 gev@xmath76 .",
    "consequently , the prediction obtained with @xmath100 can not , in this region , be considered reliable .",
    "in addition to the results calculated in the @xmath84 renormalization scheme , the numerical prediction assuming the same distribution but in the @xmath88 scheme , with the renormalization scale @xmath101 , has also been obtained . it is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : numv ] and , as seen , is in good agreement with experimental data . due to the fact that the scale @xmath92 reflects the mean gluon momentum in the nlo diagrams ,",
    "it is to be expected that the higher - order qcd corrections are minimized , so that the leading order qcd term gives a good approximation to the complete sum . +",
