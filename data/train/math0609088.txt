    "positive results about @xmath0-tuples of operators with a nontrivial common invariant subspace have been obtained in @xcite . in this article , we extend the results of abramovich _",
    "et  al _ @xcite to the case of not - necessarily commuting @xmath0-tuples of continuous linear operators .    to extend these results",
    "it will be essential to introduce the notion of joint local quasinilpotence for @xmath0-tuples of operators ( not necessarily commuting ) .",
    "the results complement the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper appears in  3 and is stated as follows :    let @xmath6 be a @xmath0-tuple of continuous linear operators .",
    "if @xmath1 is positive with respect to a cone @xmath7 and @xmath8 exists such that @xmath1 is joint locally quasinilpotent at @xmath9 , then there exists a common nontrivial invariant subspace for @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , using this theorem we deduce new results on nontrivial common invariant subspaces for @xmath0-tuples of operators ( see theorem  3.2 , corollary  3.3 ) .",
    "we will conclude this article with a section including open problems and further directions .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath10 are @xmath0 commuting operators and they are locally quasinilpotent at @xmath11 , then the compositions @xmath12 for all @xmath13 and all @xmath14 , are locally quasinilpotent at @xmath9 .",
    "in fact the intersection of the sets @xmath15 is a common invariant manifold .",
    "however if @xmath16 are not commuting , the problem becomes more complicated .",
    "let @xmath17 be two operators on the hilbert space @xmath18 defined in the following way : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the canonical basis of @xmath18 .",
    "the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are locally quasinilpotent at @xmath23 for each @xmath24 , since @xmath25 for each @xmath26 , and therefore @xmath27 .",

    "let @xmath36 be an @xmath0-tuple of continuous linear operators on a banach space @xmath2 not necessarily commuting .",
    "let us denote by @xmath37 the collection of all possible products of @xmath38 elements in @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath39    let @xmath36 be an @xmath0-tuple of continuous linear operators on a banach space @xmath2 not necessarily commuting .",
    "then , we will say that @xmath1 is uniform joint locally quasinilpotent at @xmath11 if @xmath40    the notion of uniform joint local quasinilpotence is closely related with the joint spectral radius defined by rota and strang @xcite .",
    "we can get more information about spectral theory in several variables in @xcite .",
    "although the results of this article are formulated under the hypothesis of uniform joint local quasinilpotence , nevertheless , sometimes it will be possible to replace the above - mentioned hypothesis by the following weaker property .",

    "the difference between the concept of uniform joint local quasinilpotence and joint local quasinilpotence is the lack of uniformity .",
    "next we see some properties of both concepts .",
    "@xmath39    let @xmath43 be an @xmath0-tuple of continuous linear operators on a banach space @xmath2 and let us suppose that @xmath1 is uniform joint locally quasinilpotent at @xmath44 .",
    "then for all polynomial @xmath45 of @xmath46 variables , such that @xmath47 we have that @xmath48 where @xmath49 , that is , the operator @xmath50 is locally quasinilpotent at @xmath51 .",
    "fix @xmath52 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath53 is the number of summands of the polynomial @xmath45 , and let us denote by @xmath54 the maximum of the modulus of the coefficients of @xmath45 . then , since @xmath55 is uniform joint locally quasinilpotent at @xmath51 , there exists @xmath56 such that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",

    "@xmath60    in fact the condition on the polynomial @xmath61 is a necessary condition in the proof of proposition  2.3 .",

    "it is easy to see that the operator @xmath66 is not locally quasinilpotent at @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 denotes the identity operator ) .",
    "definitions  2.1 and 2.2 are the natural extensions of the notion of local quasinilpotence for @xmath0-tuples of continuous linear operators . in fact , let us denote @xmath69 and let us denote by @xmath70 the set of all uniform joint locally quasinilpotent vectors for @xmath71 .",
    "then , we have the following result .    @xmath39    let @xmath36 be an @xmath0-tuple of continuous linear operators on a banach space @xmath2 , then the sets @xmath70 and @xmath72 are common invariant manifolds by @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , @xmath74 implies that @xmath75 .",

    "then , there exists some @xmath77 such that @xmath78 and @xmath79 for each @xmath80 and each @xmath81 .",

    "clearly , @xmath122 holds for each @xmath123 .",
    "we claim that @xmath124 for each @xmath125 . to see this , fix @xmath125 and let @xmath126 for some nonnegative scalar @xmath127 .",
    "since @xmath128 is a positive operator and the composition of positive operators is a positive operator , it follows that @xmath129 let us observe that the following inequality is not true because the norm is not monotone @xmath130 . however , if we use the fact that @xmath131 is a positive linear functional , we conclude that @xmath132 consequently , @xmath133 , and so @xmath134 from definition  2.2 we know @xmath135 .",
    "thus we deduce that @xmath136 , and condition ( [ uno ] ) must be true .",
    "now let us consider the linear subspace @xmath137 of @xmath2 generated by the set @xmath138 clearly , @xmath137 is invariant for each @xmath139 and , since @xmath140 for some @xmath141 , we see that @xmath142 . from ( [ uno ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath143 , therefore @xmath144 for each @xmath145 .",
    "this implies that @xmath146 for each @xmath147 , and consequently @xmath146 for all @xmath148 , that is , @xmath149 .",

    "@xmath39    1 .",
    "first , let us observe that if @xmath71 is joint locally quasinilpotent at @xmath51 it is possible to obtain a closed invariant subspace @xmath62 ( nontrivial ) invariant also for every positive operator @xmath152 such that @xmath153 for all @xmath154 .",
    "indeed , the above proof follows considering the closed subspace generated by @xmath155 \\hskip -1.25pc & \\quad\\ , \\forall\\ j\\in \\mathbb{n } , a\\ \\hbox{positive}\\ at_{i}=t_{i}a ( \\forall i)\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] 2 .   on the other hand ,",
    "let us mention that the subspace guaranteed in the above theorem is in fact an invariant nontrivial ideal .    in the following theorem ,",
    "positivity is with respect to the cone generated by the schauder basis of the banach space .",
    "let @xmath2 be a banach space with a schauder basis .",
    "assume that the matrix @xmath156 defines a continuous operator @xmath157 for all @xmath158 , such that the @xmath0-tuple @xmath36 is joint locally quasinilpotent at a nonzero positive vector .",
    "let @xmath159 be @xmath0-double sequences of complex numbers .",
    "if the weighted matrices @xmath160 define continuous operators @xmath161 , then @xmath162 have a common nontrivial closed invariant subspace .",
    "let @xmath99 be a schauder basis of the banach space @xmath2 , and let @xmath106 be the sequence of functional coefficients associated with the basis @xmath99 .",
    "assume that the operators @xmath16 satisfy @xmath163 for some positive nonzero vector @xmath104 .",
    "an appropriate scaling of @xmath104 shows that there exists @xmath164 satisfying @xmath165 . let us suppose that @xmath166 for all @xmath89 , then an easy argument shows that @xmath167 for all @xmath89 , and @xmath168 is a nontrivial closed invariant subspace ( here we assume that @xmath169 for all @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus , we can suppose that @xmath170 for some @xmath115 .",
    "now , let us denote by @xmath119 , the positive projection defined by @xmath171 .",
    "arguing as in the proof of theorem  3.1 , we can establish that @xmath172 for each @xmath14 , where @xmath173 for all @xmath110 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath174 for each @xmath145 .",
    "consequently , for each @xmath175 and for each positive operator @xmath176 satisfying @xmath177 , we have @xmath178 next , let us consider the vector subspace @xmath137 generated by the set @xmath179 clearly @xmath137 is invariant for each operator @xmath180 satisfying @xmath181 . also , from ( [ dos ] ) it follows that @xmath182 for all @xmath148 , that is , @xmath149 .",
    "the latter shows that @xmath150 is a nontrivial closed vector subspace of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath183 now be the operators defined by @xmath184 since @xmath185 satisfy @xmath186 for all @xmath89 , it follows that @xmath150 is invariant for each one of the operators @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the vector subspace @xmath150 is invariant under the operators @xmath187 however , the sequence of operators @xmath188 converges in the strong operator topology to @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , @xmath190 and , thus , the operators @xmath191 , have a common nontrivial closed invariant subspace . @xmath60",

    "if the continuous operators @xmath192 are defined by the matrices @xmath193 satisfying @xmath194 whenever @xmath195 , then the operators have a common nontrivial closed invariant subspace .",
    "the notion of uniform joint local quasinilpotence is used extensively in @xcite to obtain common nontrivial invariant subspaces .",
    "both concepts , joint local quasinilpotence and uniform joint local quasinilpotence , play an important role in the search of common nontrivial invariant subspaces .",
    "it would be interesting to know something more on the sets @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "our conjecture is that both sets are equal in majority of the cases .    on the other hand",
    ", it would be interesting to extend the results of theorems  3.1 and 3.3 for the case of @xmath0-tuples of positive operators defined on a hausdorff topological vector space , where the partial order is defined by means of a markushevish basis .",
