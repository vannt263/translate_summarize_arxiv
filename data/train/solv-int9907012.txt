    "in a recent paper  @xcite we have introduced the notion of `` multidimensional quadrilateral lattice '' ( mql ) , i.e. , a lattice @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with all its elementary quadrilaterals planar , which is the discrete analogue of a multidimensional conjugate net  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the planarity constraint ( which is a linear constraint ) provides a way to construct the lattice uniquely , once a suitable set of initial data is given .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed study of three basic and independent integrable reductions of the quadrilateral lattice : the symmetric lattice , the circular lattice and the @xmath1-invariant lattice ; we also study the egorov lattice which is , at the same time , symmetric , circular and @xmath1-invariant .",
    "all these reductions satisfy additional geometric properties which are compatible with the planarity constraint of the mql .    the _ symmetric _ lattice follows from the observation that one can associate , with a given quadrilateral lattice , forward and backward data connected through a potential coinciding with the @xmath0function of the lattice , and it corresponds to the particular situation in which the backward and forward rotation coefficients coincide .",
    "the _ circular _",
    "lattice , discrete analogue of an orthogonal net , is instead characterized by the fact that all its elementary quadrilaterals are inscribed in circles .",
    "@xmath1-invariant _ lattice is a mql characterized by the invariance of a certain natural frame along the main diagonal .",
    "the _ egorov _ lattice , discrete analogue of a egorov net  @xcite , is simultaneously symmetric , circular and @xmath1-invariant ( for @xmath13 ) , and can be equivalently characterized by the fact that a pair of opposite angles of the elementary quadrilateral consists of right angles .",
    "the geometric properties characterizing the above reductions make use of the connections between point lattices and hyperplane lattices ( lattices in the dual space @xmath14 ) . in some cases",
    "the connection comes from additional structure in the ambient space @xmath15 ; in some other cases , it is a consequence of the inner symmetry of the lattice .",
    "the precise connections between point and hyperplane lattices corresponding to all the above reductions are also presented in this paper .",
    "our presentation reflects the effort of constructing a general theory of the mql and of its reductions and therefore the results will not appear in a chronological order of derivation but rather in a logical order .    although the research field of integrable discrete geometry is relatively new , the amount of associated results is already very large and it is often difficult to go through the corresponding literature , also because many of these results are not even published , having being presented only during conferences or seminars , or private conversations .",
    "a brief but hopefuly correct account of the literature closed to the subject considered in this paper is the following .",
    "the proper discrete analogue of a conjugate net on a surface was first proposed by sauer  @xcite .",
    "the mql equations were first derived by bogdanov and konopelchenko  @xcite as integrable discrete analogues of the darboux equations for conjugate nets , but without any geometric characterization .",
    "the notion of circular lattice was first proposed by martin , de pont and scharrock  @xcite and nutborne  @xcite for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , as a discrete analogue of surfaces parametrized by curvature lines ( see also  @xcite ) ; later by bobenko for @xmath18 @xcite and , finally , for arbitrary @xmath12 by cieliski , doliwa and santini @xcite ; subsequently konopelchenko and schief have shown  @xcite that circular lattices in @xmath19 can be conveniently characterized by solutions of the @xmath20 dimensional discrete sine - gordon equation  @xcite . a geometric proof of the integrability of the circular lattice was first given in  @xcite while the analytic proof of its integrability was given in  @xcite through the @xmath2 method .",
    "the notion of egorov lattice with its right angles characterization was found by schief  @xcite . in the derivation of the egorov lattice",
    ", he apparently used the algebraic formulation of the symmetric constraint ; this formulation was restricted to the subclass of circular lattices and its geometric meaning was not given  @xcite .",
    "he also found the @xmath1-invariance of the egorov lattice ( the killing vector property )  @xcite .",
    "the finite - gap formulations of the circular and egorov lattices have also recently appeared in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the new results written down in this paper , although already presented in several occasions  @xcite , are the following : + 1 ) the geometric meaning of the @xmath0-function of the mql ; + 2 ) the theory of integrable hyperplane lattices , and its central role in the reduction theory of mql ; + 3 ) the algebraic and geometric notions of symmetric and @xmath1-invariant lattices , as basic and independent reductions of the mql ; + 4 ) the successful application of the @xmath21 reduction method , already used in the case of circular lattices  @xcite , to all the other reductions .    after this work was completed and presented we were told that , according to schief  @xcite , the algebraic definition of a symmetric lattice was presented in  @xcite .    in the rest of this introduction",
    "we summarize the basic results on quadrilateral lattices and the known facts on hyperplanes in projective spaces which will be used in the paper .",
    "in section  [ sec : backward ] we introduce the `` backward '' representation of the quadrilateral lattice and we show that the compatibility between the backward construction and the standard forward construction leads to the existence of a potential which can be identified with the @xmath0-function of the lattice .    in section  [ sec",

    "[ sec : d - bar ] we finally study the integrability properties of all the above lattices from the point of view of their solvability , making use of a @xmath2reduction method recently introduced in  @xcite in the continuous case and generalized in  @xcite to a discrete context .",

    "one gives @xmath42 arbitrary intersecting initial curves @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; the initial @xmath45-surface is then built uniquely assigning the initial data @xmath46 , @xmath47 , as functions of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , via equation ( [ eq : laplace ] ) .",
    "equivalently , together with the @xmath42 intersecting initial curves , we can give the initial data @xmath50 , meaning that we give the coefficients @xmath51 ( or , equivalently , the tangent vectors @xmath52 ) on the @xmath26-th initial curve and then the data @xmath53 , @xmath54 , as functions of @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the solution of the mql equations depends on @xmath55 arbitrary functions of two variables .    to make the construction of the lattice possible , in our considerations we assume we deal with _",

    "we study some distinguished reductions of the mql which posses additional geometric properties that , once imposed on the initial surfaces `` propagate '' everywhere through the construction of the lattice .",
    "since the quadrilateral lattice is integrable , these reductions will inherit its integrability properties .    in the continuous limit",

    "these considerations will turn out to be relevant in the reduction theory of the quadrilateral lattices , when the introduction of additional geometric structure will allow to establish a direct connection between point lattices and hyperplane lattices .    to make the paper self contained ,",
