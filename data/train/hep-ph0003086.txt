    "cp violation constitutes one of the main open questions in high energy physics at the beginning of the 21st century .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions is able to accommodate the experimentally observed cp violation through a phase , @xmath4 , in the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix . in spite of this",
    ", there exist strong hints from other fields ( for instance , electroweak baryogenesis ) that suggest that this can not be the only source of cp violation present in nature .",
    "0.25 cm    in fact , most of the extensions of the sm include new phases that may modify the sm predictions in cp violation phenomena .",
    "for example , even in the simplest supersymmetric extension of the sm , the so  called constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) , we have new phases in the gaugino masses , @xmath5terms and the @xmath6term @xcite . however , it is known since the early 80s @xcite , that the presence of these phases for susy masses around the electroweak scale gives rise to supersymmetric contributions to the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron and the neutron roughly two orders of magnitude above the experimental bounds . hence , given these strong constraints , most of the people working in susy phenomenology take these phases as exactly vanishing .",
    "although this might be the most direct choice , it has been recently shown that there exist some other mechanisms which allow large susy phases while respecting edm bounds .",
    "for instance , one of these mechanisms consists in a possible destructive interference among different contributions to the edm that can occur in some regions of the susy parameter space  @xcite .",
    "a second option is to have approximately degenerate heavy sfermions for the first two generations  @xcite and finally , a third possibility ( and maybe more natural ) is to have non  universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms  @xcite .",
    "0.25 cm    in the presence of one of these mechanisms , large cp phases will be present in the susy sector and one may expect important effects on cp physics other than the edm , e.g. in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 systems . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that , for vanishing @xmath4 , a general susy model with all possible phases in the soft  breaking terms , but no new flavor structure beyond the usual yukawa matrices can never generate a sizeable contribution to @xmath9 , @xmath0 or hadronic @xmath10 cp asymmetries .",
    "this means that the presence of non  universal soft breaking terms besides large susy phases is crucial to enhance these cp violation effects . in agreement with this",
    ", it has been explicitly shown that contributions to @xmath9 are small within the dilaton  dominated susy breaking of the weakly coupled heterotic string model  @xcite , where @xmath5terms as well as gaugino masses are universal .",
    "on the other hand , it is well  known that the strict universality in the soft breaking sector is a strong assumption not realized in many supergravity and string inspired models  @xcite .",
    "all these arguments indicate not only that the presence of non  universal soft terms can solve the problem of too large contributions to edms but also that it allows for large susy contributions in cp violation experiments .",
    "hence , in this work we will follow this avenue and analyze the effects of non  universal soft terms in both edm and cp violation in the @xmath7system .",
    "0.25 cm    in particular , non  universality of @xmath5terms has been shown to be very effective to generate large cp violation effects @xcite .",
    "in fact , the presence of non ",
    "degenerate @xmath5terms is essential for enhancing the gluino contributions to @xmath0 through large imaginary parts of the @xmath11@xmath12 mass insertions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as recently emphasized in ref .",
    "these susy contributions can , indeed , account for a sizeable part of the recently measured experimental value of @xmath0 @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will present an explicit realization of such mechanism in the framework of a type i superstring inspired susy model . within this model",
    ", it is possible to obtain non  universal soft breaking terms , i.e. scalar masses , gaugino masses and trilinear couplings .",
    "we show that here edms can be sufficiently small while the susy phases of the off diagonal @xmath5terms are large , and enough to generate sizable contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "0.25 cm    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we show our starting models based on type i string theory .",
    "we emphasize that it is quite natural to obtain non ",
    "universal @xmath5terms in these models . in section 3",
    "we discuss the impact of these new flavor structures on the sfermion mass matrices .",
    "we show that non  universality of the @xmath5terms , in particular , can generate sizable off  diagonal entries in the down squark mass matrix .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the discussion of the constraints from the edms of the electron and neutron .",
    "we explain that , in the model we consider with non ",
    "universal @xmath5terms , the edms can be kept sufficiently small while there are still two phases completely unconstrained .",
    "the effect of these two phases in other cp violating process are given in section 5 , where we study explicitly the effect of these phases in the k  system .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we explain our starting model , which is based on type i string models .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to study explicitly several cp aspects in models with non ",
    "universal soft breaking terms .",
    "type i models can realize such initial conditions , in particular , it is possible to obtain non  universality in the scalar masses , @xmath5terms and gaugino masses . to obtain non  universal gaugino masses",
    ", we must assign the gauge groups to different branes @xcite .",
    "type i models contain nine  branes and three types of five  branes ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "phenomenologically there is no difference between the 9brane and the 5branes .",
    "a gauge multiplet is assigned on one set of branes . only if the sm gauge group is not associated with a single set of branes",
    ", the gaugino masses can be non  universal .",
    "here we assume that the gauge group @xmath17 on one of the branes and the gauge group @xmath18 on another brane .",
    "we call these branes the @xmath17brane and the @xmath18brane , respectively .",
    "0.25 cm    now we assign chiral matter fields and the brane corresponding to @xmath19 such that we obtain non  universal @xmath5terms .",
    "chiral matter fields correspond to open strings spanning between branes .",
    "thus , chiral matter fields have non  vanishing quantum numbers only for the gauge groups corresponding to the branes between which the open string spans .",
    "for example , the chiral field corresponding to the open string between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 branes can have non  trivial representations under both @xmath17 and @xmath18 , while the chiral field corresponding to the open string , which starts and ends on the @xmath17brane , should be an @xmath18singlet .",
    "furthermore , it is required that @xmath19 should correspond to one of the @xmath17brane and @xmath18brane but not another brane such that quark doublets have non  vanishing @xmath19 charges .",
    "0.25 cm    while there is only one type of the open string which spans between different branes , there are three types of open strings which start and end on the same brane , that is , the @xmath20 sectors ( i=1,2,3 ) , which corresponding to the @xmath21-th complex compact dimension among the three complex dimensions .",
    "if we assign the three families to the different @xmath20 sectors each other , we obtain non  universality .",
    "that is the only possible non  universality and it is important for model building .",
    "that implies that we can not derive non ",
    "universality for the squark doublets , i.e. the left  handed sector .",
    "non  universality can appear in the right  handed sector only if @xmath19 corresponds to the @xmath17brane and the families are assigned to different @xmath20 sectors each other . as a linear combination of @xmath22 symmetry on the @xmath17brane and @xmath22 symmetries on other branes including the @xmath18brane .",
    "however , in this case , phenomenological results are same . ]",
    "therefore , the model leading to both non  universal gaugino masses and non ",
    "universal @xmath5terms is unique , that is , we assign @xmath23 and @xmath18 to different branes .",
    "the quark doublets correspond to the open string between the @xmath23brane and the @xmath18brane .",
    "the quark singlets correspond to three different sectors on the @xmath17brane .",
    "hence , non  universality of soft susy terms can appear only for the right  handed sector , while soft susy breaking terms are universal for the left  handed sector .",
    "0.25 cm    here we assume that the gauge group @xmath23 is originated from the 9brane and the gauge group @xmath18 is originated from the @xmath24brane like ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath18doublet fields , e.g. quark doublets and the higgs fields , should be assigned to the open string , which spans between the @xmath24 and 9branes and is denoted by the @xmath25 sector . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath18singlet fields , e.g. quark singlets , correspond to the open string , which starts and ends on the 9brane .",
    "such open string includes three sectors denoted by @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "0.25 cm    at the string level , only the @xmath28 sector is allowed in the 3point @xmath29 coupling .",
    "however , we assume that the yukawa couplings for the other sectors @xmath26 ( @xmath30 ) are allowed through higher dimensional operators after symmetry breaking within the framework of effective field theory .",
    "such effective yukawa couplings originated from higher dimensional operators naturally lead to suppressed values of couplings , while the @xmath29 coupling would correspond to the large yukawa coupling of the top quark as well as the bottom quark . within such framework",
    ", the hierarchical structure of fermion mass matrices could be realized .",
    "then we allow all of the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) as candidates of quark singlets .",
    "in particular , we assign the @xmath28 sector to the third family .",
    "also we assign the first and second families of quark singlets to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , in order to derive non ",
    "universal a  terms .",
    "0.25 cm    under the above assignment of the gauge multiplets and the matter fields , soft susy breaking terms are obtained , following the formulae in ref .",
    "the gaugino masses are obtained @xmath33 while the @xmath5-terms are obtained as @xmath34 for the coupling including @xmath35 , i.e. the third family , @xmath36 for the coupling including @xmath37 , i.e. the second family and @xmath38 for the coupling including @xmath39 , i.e. the first family . here",
    "@xmath40 is the gravitino mass , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the cp phases of the f - terms of the dilaton field @xmath43 and the three moduli fields @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are goldstino angles , and we have the constraint , @xmath47 . 0.25 cm    thus , if quark fields correspond to different @xmath48 sectors , we have non  universal a  terms",
    ". then we obtain the following a  matrix for both of the up and down sectors , @xmath49 note that the non  universality appears only for the right  handed sector .",
    "the trilinear susy breaking matrix , @xmath50 , itself is obtained @xmath51 in matrix notation .",
    "0.25 cm    in addition , soft scalar masses for quark doublets and the higgs fields are obtained , @xmath52 the soft scalar masses for quark singlets are obtained as @xmath53 if it corresponds to the @xmath54 sector .",
    "0.25 cm    finally , we fix the magnitudes of the @xmath6term and @xmath8term by using the minimization conditions of the higgs potential .",
    "this completes the whole set of initial conditions in our type i string inspired model .",
    "in the previous section , we have defined our string inspired model . below the string scale , this model is simply a mssm ( understood as with the minimal particle content from the sm ) with non  trivial soft  breaking terms from the point of view of flavor .",
    "scalar mass matrices and trilinear terms have completely new flavor structures , as opposed to the supergravity inspired cmssm or the sm , where the only connection between different generations is provided by the yukawa matrices",
    ". 0.25 cm    this model includes in the quark sector 7 different structures of flavor , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) . from these matrices , @xmath55 ,",
    "the squark doublet mass matrix , is proportional to the identity matrix , and hence trivial , then we are left with 6 non ",
    "trivial flavor matrices . notice that we have always the freedom to diagonalize the hermitian squark mass matrices and then yukawa and trilinear matrices are completely fixed .",
    "this implies that , in this case , these four matrices are observable , as opposed to the sm or cmssm case , where only quark masses and the ckm matrix are observable .",
    "0.25 cm    at this point , to specify completely the model , we need not only the soft  breaking terms but also the complete yukawa textures . the only available experimental information is the ckm mixing matrix and the quark masses . in this work , as an estimate of possible effects we choose our yukawa texture following two simple assumptions : i ) the ckm mixing matrix originates from the down yukawa couplings and ii ) yukawa matrices are hermitian @xcite . with these two assumptions we fix completely the yukawa matrices at the string scale , @xmath63 , @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "through all the paper we fix @xmath66 and @xmath7 is the ckm matrix . in principle ,",
    "generic yukawa matrices in this basis of diagonal squark masses could be different @xcite , but other matrices lead to physically similar results for the following analyses .",
    "hence , the texture in eq.([yuk ] ) is enough for our purposes .",
    "0.25 cm    in this basis we can analyze the down trilinear matrix that with eqs.([trilinear ] ) and ( [ yuk ] ) is , @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "0.25 cm    hence , together with the up trilinear matrix we have our model completely defined .",
    "the next step is simply to use the mssm renormalization group equations ( rge ) @xcite to obtain the whole spectrum and couplings at the low scale , @xmath69 .",
    "the dominant effect in rges of the trilinear terms is due to the gluino mass which produces the well  known alignment among a  terms and gaugino phases .",
    "however this rg effect is always proportional to the yukawa matrices and not to the trilinear terms themselves , that is , roughly the rges are @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "this implies that , in the sckm basis the gluino effects are diagonalized in excellent approximation , while due to the different flavor structure of the trilinear terms large off ",
    "diagonal elements remain with phases @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "to see this more explicitly , we can roughly approximate the rge effects as , @xmath72 with @xmath73 the physical gluino mass and @xmath74 , @xmath75 coefficients order 1 ( typically @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) . 0.25 cm    we go to the sckm basis after diagonalizing all the yukawa matrices ( i.e. @xmath78 ) . in this basis",
    "we obtain the trilinear couplings as , @xmath79 from this equation we can get the @xmath11@xmath12 down squark mass matrix @xmath80 finally using unitarity of @xmath7 we obtain for the @xmath11@xmath12 mass insertions , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an average squark mass and @xmath83 the quark mass .",
    "0.25 cm    this expression shows the main effects of the non ",
    "universal @xmath5terms . in the first place",
    ", we can see that the diagonal elements are still very similar to the universal @xmath5terms situation .",
    "apart of the usual scaling with the quark mass , these flavor  diagonal mass insertions receive dominant contributions from the corresponding @xmath84 terms ( due to the fact that the ckm mixing matrix is close to the identity ) plus an approximately equal contribution from gluino to all three generations and an identical @xmath6 term contribution . hence , given that the gluino rg effects are dominant in eq.([yarge ] ) , also the phases of these terms tend to align with the gluino phase , as in the cmssm",
    ". therefore , edm bounds constrain mainly the relative phase between @xmath6 and gluino ( or chargino ) and give a relatively weaker constraint to the relative phase between @xmath85 ( the first generation @xmath5term ) and the relevant gaugino @xcite as we will show in the next section .",
    "effects of different @xmath84 in these elements are suppressed by squared ckm mixing angles .",
    "however , flavor  off ",
    "diagonal elements are completely new in our model .",
    "they do not receive significant contributions from gluino nor from @xmath6 and so their phases are still determined by the @xmath84 phases and , in principle , they do not directly contribute to edms .",
    "it is also important to notice that in these off ",
    "diagonal elements the relevant quark mass is the one of the left ",
    "handed quark , see eqs.([a - sckm],[dlr ] ) . in section [ sec : kaon ] , we will analyze the effects of these mass insertions in the kaon system .",
    "0.25 cm    in the same way , we must also apply the same rotations to the @xmath11@xmath11 and @xmath12@xmath12 squark mass matrices , @xmath86 from eq.([doublets ] ) we have the universal mass for the squark doublets .",
    "this matrix remains approximately universal at @xmath69 and hence the off ",
    "diagonal elements after the rotation to the sckm basis are sufficiently small . however",
    "the case of @xmath87 is different .",
    "the masses of the squark singlets , eq.([singlets ] ) , are not universal and hence sizeable off  diagonal elements are generated after the rotation to the sckm basis .",
    "these entries could cause problems with the bounds from mass insertions @xcite .",
    "however , this non  universality is diluted by the universal and dominant contribution from gluino to the squark mass matrices in the rge . in the next sections we will analyze some cp violation observables in this framework .",
    "in this section we show that , in the class of models with non degenerate @xmath5terms , the edm of the electron and neutron can be naturally smaller than the experimental limits , @xmath88 even in the presence of new supersymmetric phases @xmath71 . as mentioned in the introduction , in the universal @xmath5term scenarios we have severe constraints on the susy phases from edms apart from a few points in the parameter space where cancellations occur . in the absence of cancellations among different contributions @xmath89 , the phase of the @xmath6 term ,",
    "is constrained to be @xmath90 , while @xmath91 is not strongly constrained @xcite .",
    "the cancellation mechanism allows for somewhat larger phases at special regions in the parameter space .",
    "however in this points where we could have large phases , we can not generate any sizable susy contribution to cp violation in the absence of new flavor structure @xcite .",
    "moreover , this mechanism , when not justified by a symmetry argument , involves necessarily a certain degree of fine tuning @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show that in the non  universal situation there is no need to restrict our parameter space to the cancellation regions to have large supersymmetric phases and , more important , large contributions to cp violation observables exist .",
    "0.25 cm    the supersymmetric contributions to the edm include gluino , chargino and neutralino loops . in first place , we consider the gluino contribution which gives usually the major contribution .",
    "the gluino contribution for the edm of the quark @xmath92 and @xmath93 in sckm basis are given by    = 12 cm    @xmath94    where @xmath73 is complex in this model and @xmath95 .",
    "the function @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 and by using the non  relativistic quark model approximation of the edm of neutron we can calculate it in terms of the mass insertions @xmath98 and @xmath99 . 0.25 cm    it is important to notice in eq.([gluinoedm ] ) , that the relevant phase for the gluino contribution is the relative phase between the gluino mass and the @xmath11@xmath12 mass insertion @xcite .",
    "thus , the physical phases entering in gluino contributions are @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "a very similar situation happens in the chargino contributions .",
    "these contributions are given by the squark and chargino mass matrices .",
    "hence , in the same way as with the gluino contributions , the relevant phases are the relative phases between chargino masses , @xmath104 , @xmath89 , and @xmath11@xmath12 mass insertions .",
    "0.25 cm    as explained above , we can see from eq.([dlr ] ) that these flavor  diagonal mass insertions tend to align with the gluino phase ( this is also true for the up squark mass matrices ) .",
    "hence , to have a small edm it is enough to have the phases of the gauginos and the @xmath6 term approximately equal , @xmath105 . on the other hand , the phases of the @xmath5terms are not strongly constrained by the edm bounds and so @xmath106 and @xmath107 can still be @xmath71 .",
    "this situation was already present even in the cmssm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this case , we have the additional freedom of independent phases for different elements of the trilinear matrix , eqs.([a - c1],[a - c2],[a - c3 ] ) . 0.25 cm    in figure [ scat ] we show the allowed values for @xmath41 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 assuming @xmath108 .",
    "all other parameters in the model are scanned in the range : @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 with the constraint @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , we have imposed all the usual constraints :    * squark masses above @xmath112 gev with the only possible exception of the lightest stop and sbottom above @xmath113 .",
    "* charginos heavier than @xmath114 gev * branching ratio of the @xmath115 decay , including supersymmetric contributions from chargino and gluino , from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "* gluino and chargino contributions to @xmath118 and @xmath119 independently smaller than the phenomenological bounds . *",
    "gluino and chargino contributions to @xmath9 smaller than @xmath120 .",
    "we can see that , similarly to the cmssm situation , @xmath89 is constrained to be very close to the gluino and chargino phases ( in the plot @xmath121 ) , but @xmath106 and @xmath107 are completely unconstrained .",
    "it is also important to notice that we do not consider the possible cancellation regions . in any case",
    ", these special regions would only enlarge our allowed parameter space , mainly with larger relative phases between @xmath6 and gauginos .",
    "however , we will see in the next section that , without these additional regions , large effects in cp violation observables are already present .",
    "we have shown in the previous section , that the presence of non ",
    "universal @xmath5terms allows the existence of large phases in the supersymmetry soft  breaking sector while keeping edms sufficiently small .",
