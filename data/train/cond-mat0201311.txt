    "a knowledge of the three dimensional structure of a protein is crucial for understanding its biological functionality .",
    "unfortunately , the rate at which protein structures can be experimentally solved is far behind the speed at which the sequences are determined . with progress in the human genome project , a good computer - based method for the prediction of protein structures from their sequences would be an invaluable tool for modern microbiology as well as for drug design .",
    "the existing methods for structure prediction can be divided into two classes : 1 ) template - based methods which compare a sequence with unknown structure against the library of solved structures and 2 ) ab initio methods which seek to identify the native fold usually defined as the lowest energy point in conformational space .",
    "the latter are specially useful when a target sequence has a low similarity with the existing protein sequences of known structures .",
    "it should be noted though that many so called ab initio methods do use information derived from the protein database as input .",
    "significant progress has been achieved in the ab initio approach to protein structure prediction as witnessed in the casp competitions , @xcite wherein the structures of large protein fragments , comprising as many as 100 residues , were predicted with an accuracy of 4 - 7 @xmath2 in rmsd .",
    "a notable success reported was that of the baker group and entailed the assembly of protein conformations from fragments of known structures in the protein database , which have local sequences similar to that of the target sequence , using statistically derived scoring functions.@xcite in levitt s approach,@xcite secondary structures , which were predicted by using several existing secondary structure prediction methods , @xcite are fitted to best scoring compact conformations obtained on a simplified tetrahedral lattice .",
    "scheraga and coworkers @xcite use an off - lattice c@xmath3-based model with interactions imposed on virtual side - chains and virtual peptide groups .",
    "the lowest - energy c@xmath3 trace obtained by extensive conformational space annealing is then converted to an all - atom backbone for further refinements .",
    "skolnick et al .",
    "@xcite built discretized protein conformations using predicted secondary structures and a number of tertiary restraints derived from multiple sequence alignments .",
    "the success of these ab initio methods relies to a large extent on knowledge - based information , i.e. data derived from known protein structures , such as that used in the scoring functions , secondary structure prediction or in the choice of fragments to incorporate in the model .",
    "our work deals with secondary structure prediction and builds on a truly ab initio protein structure prediction procedure called linus developed by srinivasan and rose.@xcite linus does not use any knowledge - based information and thus provides a clear picture of the role played by the different factors in folding .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm for determining the structure is not based on energy minimization ",
    "linus captures the interplay between energy and entropy in determining the local secondary structure .",
    "the most powerful aspect of linus is its simplicity  it is based on just 4 essential aspects of protein behavior : ( 1 ) excluded volume , ( 2 ) preferred occupancies of the dihedral angles in certain regions in the ramachandran plot,@xcite ( 3 ) hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding and ( 4 ) the hierarchical organization of protein structures .",
    "@xcite in spite of this simplicity , linus has already proved to be effective in predicting the secondary and super - secondary structures of protein fragments .",
    "@xcite note that the hierarchical algorithm steers folding along some specific pathways and the resulting structure does not necessarily correspond to the global energy minimum .",
    "in a subsequent study,@xcite srinivasan and rose used linus to propose a physical basis for secondary structures , which showed that protein secondary structures are mainly determined by steric effects and local interactions .",
    "this conclusion recently obtained strong support from experimental evidence that unfolded protein conformations , under highly denaturing conditions and thus in the absence of long - range contacts , are still characterized by local native - like topology .",
    "@xcite in linus , the conformational bias towards a type of secondary structure is determined through the probability of being in this conformation during simulation .",
    "we have found this idea to be intriguing and worthy of a careful reexamination . here",
    ", we make an assessment of how well the secondary structures can be predicted based on the analysis of conformational biases . in particular we concentrate on the role played by the temperature , @xmath4 , in determining the success rate and find that there is an optimal @xmath4 at which the secondary structure prediction is the best . for most of the proteins",
    "studied , this temperature coincides with the one that rose and srinivasan used in their studies and is found to be near the peak in the specific heat where the conformational conversion in the system is the largest .",
    "the optimal conditions for the structure prediction do not depend much on whether the window in the interactions allowed for purely local or also for non - local interactions .",
    "they are also insensitive to the duration of the simulations .",
    "we obtained very similar results when long , nearly equilibrium , simulations were considered .",
    "the aim of our study is to elucidate how linus works and what its strengths and weaknesses are .",
    "the ultimate goal would be to determine what kinds of improvements could be made in this physically appealing framework to move towards first principles tertiary structure prediction .",
    "a detailed description of linus can be found in the original papers of srinivasan and rose.@xcite we have developed our own version of linus that strictly follows the improved development as described in the pnas paper@xcite .",
    "briefly , in linus , the coordinates of all backbone atoms are considered whereas a sidechain is represented in a simplified manner .",
    "specifically , glycine has no sidechain , alanine s sidechain is made of a c@xmath5 and the remaining amino acids are represented by c@xmath5 and one or two pseudo c@xmath6 atoms , depending on whether the sidechain is branched out or not .",
    "the atoms are modeled as hard spheres that are not allowed to overlap .",
    "the sizes of the spheres depend on the type of the atom and the sizes of the pseudo - atoms depend on the size of the sidechains that they represent .",
    "apart from steric interactions , the hamiltonian consists of just a few terms that provide attraction between atoms : hydrogen bonding ( h - bond ) , hydrophobic interaction , and salt bridges .",
    "all backbone nitrogens , except for those that belong to a proline , are considered to be h - bond donors and participate in no more than one h - bond but the nitrogen at the n - terminus may participate in up to three h - bonds .",
    "the backbone oxygens and the sidechains of some amino acids ( ser , thr , asn , asp , gln , glu ) are acceptors .",
    "a backbone - to - backbone hydrogen bond is assumed to be formed between residues @xmath7 and @xmath8 when they are at least three residue apart in the sequence and when the distance between a donor and an acceptor is smaller than 5@xmath2 .",
    "an energy of @xmath9 is assigned , where @xmath10 is an energy unit , and the energy is scaled quasi - linearly from 0 to its minimal value as the distance decreases to 3.5@xmath2 .",
    "it is also required that the out - of - plane dihedral angle o@xmath11n@xmath12c@xmath13c@xmath14 should be larger than @xmath15 .",
    "a sidechain - to - backbone hydrogen bond is formed when the donor - to - acceptor distance is smaller than 4@xmath2 and the acceptor must be not further than four residues away from the donor in the sequence . in this case an energy of @xmath16 is assigned and no scaling of the energy is involved .",
    "hydrophobic attraction is postulated to occur for contacts between the sidechain atoms of hydrophobic ( cys , ile , leu , met , phe , trp , val ) and amphipathic ( ala , his , thr , tyr ) residues .",
    "the minimal value of the contact energy is @xmath9 when both residues are hydrophobic and @xmath17 when one of them is hydrophobic and the other is amphipathic .",
    "a contact between two atoms @xmath7 and @xmath8 is said to form when the distance between them is smaller than @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the contact radii of the two atoms .",
    "the contact radii of the atoms @xcite depend on the kind of atoms and are larger than their hard sphere radii .",
    "the energy of a contact scales from 0 to its minimal value as the distance between two atoms decreases from its cut - off value to @xmath21 .",
    "a salt bridge is assigned to contacts between oppositely charged groups ( namely the sidechains of arg or lys with glu or asp ) .",
    "the minimal energy of a salt bridge is @xmath9 . in linus",
    "there is also an energy function to chase residues away from the right hand side of the ramachandran plot .",
    "when a residue has a positive torsional angle @xmath22 it is punished with an energy of @xmath16 if the residue is not a glycine , otherwise it is rewarded with an energy of @xmath16 .",
    "the main degrees of freedom used in linus are the ramachandran torsional angles @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the torsional @xmath24 which corresponds to rotation of the sidechains .",
    "additionally the torsional angle @xmath25 about the peptide bond and the n - c@xmath3-c bond angle are allowed to be perturbed slightly during the simulation .",
    "all the other bond angles and bond lengths are kept fixed .",
    "three consecutive residues @xmath26 are perturbed at a time and the movements advance from the n - terminus to the c - terminus .",
    "the moves at an @xmath7th residue are repeatedly chosen until a move is obtained in which there are no steric clashes within the three residue fragment considered . at the next stage the whole protein chain is checked for the presence of steric clashes .",
    "up to 50 such attempts are performed in order to find a conformation without any steric clashes .",
    "if the new conformation found still has steric clashes it is rejected , otherwise it is accepted with a probability @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 is the temperature measured in the units of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the energy difference . a complete progression from n to c",
    "is called a cycle .",
    "linus uses a smart move set that consists of the following , equally probable , move types    1 .",

    "after each cycle a conformation assignment is determined to gather statistics on @xmath66 .",
    "the average is taken over 10 simulations for each @xmath4 .    in order to make comparisons with the dssp - based native assignments @xcite used in the pdb,@xcite we adopt a simplified correspondence in which the @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath1- helix correspond to @xmath77 , the isolated @xmath0-bridges and extended @xmath0-strands to @xmath75 , the hydrogen bonded turn to @xmath79 , and bends and undefined segments to @xmath67 .",
    "it should be noted that the native state secondary structure assignment used by srinivasan and rose @xcite for the proteins studied does not fully agree with the one used in the pdb . in the following",
    ", our results are benchmarked against the pdb - based assignment .    in order to explore the role of local and non local interactions we consider two choices for the interaction window , @xmath82 , of 6 and @xmath69 .",
    "the interaction window restricts interactions along the sequence .",
    "@xmath83 means that all interactions between two residues @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath84 are switched off , whereas in the case of @xmath85 all interactions are present .",
    "we begin our discussions with protein g ( pdb code 1gb1 ) , the protein showing the best conformational biases towards native secondary structures in the set of proteins studied by srinivasan and rose .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath66 as a function of residue at three different temperatures @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 is the temperature which srinivasan and rose used in their simulations .",
    "the interaction window is set to 6 .",
    "the conformational biases towards @xmath1-helices ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath0-strands ( @xmath75 ) , turns ( @xmath79 ) and coils ( @xmath67 ) are shown .",
    "note that at @xmath86 the strands dominate over all other structures .",
    "thus the whole protein chain prefers to be in the strand conformation at high temperatures .",
    "this follows from the simple observation that the entropy is largest in the strand conformation and is the dominant factor in the free energy at high temperatures . at low temperatures , such as @xmath90 , the bias towards the strands vanishes while the highest biases belong to helices and turns .",
    "this is because helices and turns involve favorable interactions , which are predominantly local and are thus stabilized at low temperatures . at the intermediate temperature , @xmath89 , the dominating structure varies as one proceeds along the sequence .",
    "some parts of the protein prefer to be in a strand conformation while others form helices and turns .",
    "because the biases strongly depend on @xmath4 , one may ask what the temperature is at which the native secondary structure can be most reliably predicted . in order to answer this question",
    "we have carried out an extensive analysis of the biases over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "figure 2a shows two sequences of secondary structure assignments .",
    "the first corresponds to the known native conformation of protein g , and the second is obtained from the biases given in the middle panel of figure 1 , i.e. at @xmath89 . in the latter case",
    "an assignment at a given site is set to the type of secondary structure showing the highest bias .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath91 which estimates overlaps between the two sets of assignments for each kind of secondary structure . for a given type of conformation , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "@xmath91 is defined as the number of sites at which both assignments ( from pdb and from the biases ) are @xmath92 divided by the number of sites at which at least one of the assignments is @xmath92 .",
    "specifically if @xmath94 is a set of sites of type @xmath92 in the pdb assignment and @xmath95 is a set of sites of the same type of conformation predicted by the biases then @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a function which returns the number of elements in @xmath98 .",
    "thus , if @xmath99 then @xmath100 .",
    "we call @xmath91 the rate of successful prediction .",
    "figure 2b shows @xmath91 as function of @xmath4 for the strands , helices and turns for protein g. note that the values of @xmath91 are the largest around @xmath89 . at this temperature",
    "the rate of prediction is the highest for helices and exceeds 90% ( it is 100% at @xmath101 ) , while strands and turns are predicted at 74% and 23% levels respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath91 were obtained with the reference to pdb assignment .",
    "if the srinivasan and rose assignment is used instead , the corresponding success rates are 90% , 63% and 35% respectively . as @xmath4 increases the rate for the strands first decreases and then remains roughly at a constant value while the rate for helices drops rapidly and vanishes at @xmath102 .",
    "a nearly opposite scenario is observed as @xmath4 becomes smaller than 0.5  the rate for strands drops rapidly while it remains high for the helices .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath91 as a function of @xmath4 for protein g but as calculated with @xmath85 .",
    "we still observe the same picture as for @xmath83 , except that at low temperatures the prediction rates for helices and strands become somewhat higher .",
    "the optimal temperature , however , remains close to @xmath87 .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show @xmath91 as functions of @xmath4 for 6 other proteins in the set studied by rose for @xmath83 and @xmath69 respectively . for @xmath83",
    ", as in protein g , the best prediction rates are obtained at about @xmath89 for all of the proteins except for plastocyanin ( 6pcy ) and myo hemerythrin ( 2hmq ) .",
    "the latter proteins are special because they consist of only one kind of secondary structure in addition to the turn .",
    "the native conformation of plastocyanin is built only of @xmath0-strands and that of hemerythrin is a four - helix bundle .",
    "the best prediction rates are obtained for a range of temperatures which corresponds to @xmath103 for plastocyanin and to @xmath104 for hemerythrin . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the optimal temperature varies a little but for most of the proteins it remains in the range from 0.4@xmath29 to 0.6@xmath29 .",
    "it should also be noted that , when @xmath105 , the rates for the strands at low temperatures become significantly larger than in the @xmath83 case for all proteins .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that , at low @xmath4 , the strands can be stabilized only by non - local interactions , which are absent when @xmath83 .",
    "the results in figures 2 through 5 are generally similar even when the srinivasan - rose secondary structure assignment is used underscoring the robustness of our results .",
    "the only difference is that the predictions pertaining to the turns are improved compared to the pdb - based secondary structure assignment .",
    "what is the principle that governs the choice of the optimal temperature ?",
    "figure 6 shows how conformational changes occur with respect to temperature for each residue of protein g for the case of @xmath83 .",
    "it is seen clearly that most of the strands are destabilized at low temperatures whereas helices are absent at high temperatures .",
    "thus in order to have both kinds of structures predicted the optimal temperature for the prediction should be in a range of intermediate temperatures where helices have started to form but strands have not vanished . it can be seen in figure 6 that as the temperature is lowered , the strands undergo a transition to helices or other kinds of structures such as turns or coils .",
    "a helix can also be formed from a coil as the temperature continues to decrease . because helices and turns are associated with the establishment of h - bonds while strands and coils usually have no contacts such transitions entail a change in energy which is reflected in the specific heat .",
    "this suggests that the optimal temperature for secondary structure prediction ought to be in the vicinity of the peak of the specific heat , and likely a bit higher than the temperature of its maximum in order not to discriminate against the strands .",
    "the connection between the thermodynamics of the system and the optimal temperature for the prediction are shown in figures 7 and 8 for protein g and plastocyanin and hemerythrin respectively .",
    "the specific heat @xmath106 as a function of temperature is calculated using the histogram technique.@xcite for each protein we performed a long simulation of @xmath107 cycles at @xmath89 to deduce the thermodynamic behavior at that temperature and other temperatures in its vicinity .",
    "the results are shown for the two values of @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath83 the maximum in @xmath106 occurs roughly at @xmath108 for the three proteins .",
    "for @xmath85 the magnitude of the peak in @xmath106 is higher and it also occurs at a slightly higher temperature due to the presence of the long range interactions .",
    "( it is interesting to note that the experimentally determined specific heat of plastocyanin @xcite shows a sharp maximum around @xmath109c . )",
    "note that for protein g the optimal temperature for the secondary structure prediction is found in the vicinity of the peak in the specific heat  just to the right of the maximum .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in the case of plastocyanin except that the optimal temperature at @xmath83 is farther from the maximum in @xmath106 .",
    "this is due to the fact that plastocyanin consists only of @xmath0-sheets and the strands are more favored at high temperatures .",
    "however , in the case of myo hemerythrin , whose native state contains mainly @xmath1-helices , the behavior is just the opposite .",
    "the optimal temperature for the prediction is now on the low temperature side of the peak in the specific heat .",
    "a comparison of figures 4 and 5 shows that at the temperature corresponding to the maximum in @xmath106 , the rates of successful prediction are already close to their best values .",
    "the results described so far are based on short time simulations which last for 1000 cycles at each @xmath4 .",
    "figure 9 shows @xmath91 as function of @xmath4 for protein g when the conformational biases are determined from nearly equilibrium simulations .",
    "these simulations are performed similar to the calculation of the specific heat : we make a long simulation of @xmath110 cycles at @xmath89 and then use the histogram method to obtain the biases at other temperatures .",
    "the profiles of @xmath91 over @xmath4 are surprisingly similar to those shown in figure 3 and the peaks seem to be even more pronounced .",
    "the predictions given by the conformational biases are found to be insensitive to the length of simulations , at least for a range of temperatures which are close to the optimal value .",
    "our results confirm that the analysis of conformational biases is a fast and useful tool to get information about native protein secondary structures .",
    "we find that the most common secondary motifs , @xmath1-helices and @xmath0-strands , can be predicted with an accuracy ranging from roughly 40% up to 100% .",
    "our analysis shows that while the rate of successful prediction is insensitive to the interaction window as well as to the length of the simulations , the choice of temperature appears to be critical .",
    "the optimal run temperature is found to be related to the peak temperature in the specific heat . unlike commonly used algorithms in which one attempts to minimize an energy function to determine the native state structure",
    ", linus is an algorithm that relies on a delicate interplay between the entropy favoring the strands and energetic considerations favoring turns and helices . because there is no procedure in linus that allows for an assembly of strands through the appropriate non - local interactions into a sheet , secondary structure prediction in essence depends on the persistence of a strand conformation down to intermediate temperatures in regions corresponding to strands in the native structure , while other regions adopt the helix and the turn conformations due to the energy gain through the local contacts .",
    "an improvement in the prediction might be expected on extending the `` local independently nucleated units of structure '' to some judiciously chosen non - local interactions for the assembly of @xmath0-sheets .",
