    "bogoliubov s description of the quantum - mechanical ground state of dilute gases of interacting bosons @xcite forms the basis of our understanding of these systems .",
    "@xcite yet , despite its widespread acceptance and aura of venerability , it has long been recognized that several aspects of bogoliubov s theory were not very well understood.@xcite    in a recent paper , @xcite we analyzed bogoliubov s theory in quite some detail , and discussed several problematic aspects of this theory , which originate in the so - called bogoliubov prescription on one hand , and in the non - conservation of the number of bosons on the other . in particular , we have shown that bogoliubov s theory does not model a unique system of @xmath2 interacting bosons , but rather describes an independent collection of such systems , where in each one of these systems @xmath2 bosons are allowed to be in either one of the three single particle states with momenta @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , in bogoliubov s theory , a truncated version @xmath5 of the total hamiltonian @xmath6 of the system is considered , and this truncated hamiltonian @xmath5 is written as a sum @xmath7 , where each @xmath8 describes a sytem of @xmath2 bosons that can only be in one of three momentum states : @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "then , the hamiltonians @xmath8 are diagonalized independently from one another , leading to a theory that describes , as we mentioned above , not a unique system of @xmath2 interacting bosons , where the same particle in the condensed state with @xmath11 can be excited to any one of the other single - particle states with @xmath12 , but a juxtaposition of independent systems , each with its own reservoir of @xmath2 bosons , and where a boson in the condensate with @xmath13 can only be excited to one of the single particle states @xmath14 .",
    "reformulating the theory so as to describe a unique system of @xmath2 bosons such that a boson in the condensate with @xmath13 can now be excited to any one of single - particle states with momenta @xmath15 , and taking care to preserve the conservation of particle number , we have explicitly shown@xcite that the depletion of bosons is significantly reduced with respect to the bogoliubov case , and that the elementary excitations of the truncated hamiltonian @xmath5 become gapped , in contradiction with the results of the standard bogoliubov theory .",
    "as has been noted elsewhere , @xcite a gapped excitation spectrum does not necessarily indicate that the theory is incorrect or that there is a problem with the underlying variational procedure . actually , most number - conserving theories tend to predict a gapped excitation spectrum .",
    "@xcite of course , experimental evidence dictates that in a complete theory the elementary excitations of a uniform , translationally invariant system of interacting bosons should not have a gap .",
    "this , however , should not induce us to turn a blind eye to all the conceptual difficulties of bogoliubov s theory and accept it as  the \" correct formulation merely because it predicts a gapless excitation spectrum .",
    "to do so would violate the integrity of the whole process of scientific inquiry , in which the end does not justify the means , and every approximate theory needs to be conceptually sound before its results can be accepted .",
    "so , rather than continuing to use an imperfect formulation which predicts a gapless spectrum using highly questionable intermediate steps , a proper approach would consist in using a theory with sound foundations and no internal inconsistencies even if such a theory predicts elementary excitations that have a finite gap , and work toward improving this theory to eventually reach a refined version that predicts no gap .",
    "after all , progress in research is most of the time incremental , and there is a better chance of a conceptually sound gapless theory to emerge from a correctly formulated gapped approach than from an incorrectly formulated gapless one .    in this article , we want to resume the project we started in ref . and re - examine the way in which bogoliubov s theory of a dilute bose gas at @xmath1 has been extended to describe the statistical mechanics of interacting bosons at finite temperatures . here",
    "again , we find upon close scrutiny that several aspects of the conventional formulation of the statistical mechanics of bose systems are quite questionable and do not rest on sound foundations .",
    "the main manifestation of this is our finding that what usually passes as the grand - canonical treatment of the bogoliubov hamiltonian of interacting bosons is not a grand - canonical treatment at all , and is in fact a canonical one .",
    "a clue that betrays the canonical nature of the standard bogoliubov - beliaev - popov ( bbp ) theory at finite temperature is the presence of the density of condensed bosons @xmath16 in the expressions of the thermodynamic quantities derived within this approach when in fact in a grand - canonical formulation the number of condensed bosons @xmath17 should be traced over and should not even appear in these expressions .",
    "another clue is the fact that the density of bosons @xmath18 in these formulations is taken to be a constant that does not vary with temperature , while in a grand - canonical description the average density of bosons is not fixed , but depends on other thermodynamic variables , most notably the temperature .",
    "below , we will show that the main results of the bbp approach can be derived within a purely canonical formulation , and we show how one can extend this theory to the grand - canonical case where the system is in contact with a particle reservoir and the average density of bosons @xmath18 is not a constant , but depends on the chemical potential @xmath19 , the volume @xmath20 and the temperature @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and explicitly derive an expression of this dependence .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] we review the standard formulation of the statistical mechanics of a dilute bose gas .",
    "this formulation is based on the use of the so - called bogoliubov prescription , where the imaginary - time boson field @xmath22 is approximated as the sum of a condensed part @xmath23 , treated as a constant in @xmath24-space , and a fluctuating field @xmath25 representing depleted bosons : @xmath26 in ref . , we saw that the zero temperature version of this prescription was the root cause of many shortcomings and inconsistencies of bogoliubov s theory . here , we will show that the finite temperature version of bogoliubov s prescription creates one more major inconsistency by artificially leading to the appearance of a jump discontinuity in the density of condensed bosons @xmath16 at the critical transition temperature @xmath3 .",

    "another important result of this paper is the realization that the discontinuous jump in the condensate density @xmath16 at the critical transition temperature @xmath3 that is commonly obtained by these bbp type of theories originates from the inappropriate generalization of the bogoliubov prescription @xmath504 to finite temperatures . indeed , not only is the @xmath11 fourier component of @xmath22 , which is a flucuating field in @xmath505-space , replaced with a scalar @xmath23 , but furthermore this scalar is erroneously assumed to have a temperature dependence even though no thermal averaging process is involved .",
    "this state of great confusion that is directly caused by bogoliubov s prescription undescores the importance of using methods that circumvent this type of ad - hoc approximations . within the number - conserving variational approach used in this paper , where bogoliubov s prescription is avoided altogether , no such issues arise , as the condensate fraction @xmath506 vanishes continuously at @xmath86 and the jump discontinuity discussed above does not occur .",

    "a prominent example of this is the common use of the relation @xmath507 with a temperature - independent @xmath18 ( most notably to find the condensate fraction @xmath506 ) , which is only correct to do in the canonical ensemble . in sec .",
    "[ sec : grandcanonicalformulation ] , we have shown how one can devise a formulation which is truly grand - canonical by tracing over the number of bosons in the system using saddle - point techniques .",

    "this is not a statement that this author is taking lightly , nor is there any derogatory or polemical intent in it .",
    "the fact is , if we can all agree that bogoliubov s prescription introduces an erroneous temperature dependence in the expression of @xmath27 on the _ rhs _ of this prescription ( which at the most should be regarded as @xmath90 and not @xmath16 ) , and that this erroneous temperature dependence trickles down to the expression of the green s functions , then one is automatically led to the conclusion that any results based on such erroneous green s functions can not be taken at face value and need to be thoroughly and carefully re - examined .",
    "5 .   in addition to the four items above , which constitute the most important results of this paper , we have derived other , auxiliary rsults along the way which , while not as important , should not be completely overlooked .",
    "an example of this would be our prediction that the shift in critical temperature @xmath511 due to the repulsive interactions between bosons varies with the dimensionless parameter @xmath30 like @xmath512 , with the exponent @xmath513 appearing to be quite robust , as it is obtained both in the naive bogoliubov theory and in our number - conserving variational approximation . 6 .",
    "finally , the variation of the  gap paramter \" @xmath342 and the prefactor @xmath381 in the expression of the ground state energy of the dilute bose gas with the interaction parameter @xmath514 are also interesting results in their own right . having been derived somewhat hastily here , these results deserve a more thorough examination , perhaps in a future contribution .",
    "the author understands that the variational theory studied in ref . and in the present paper , having two variational parameters to be determined self - consistently , is definitely more cumbersome that the sleek - looking and elegant bogoliubov method",
    "however , as we mentioned in the introduction , this should not be an excuse for us to continue using bogoliubov s theory totally unabated , after having witnessed all the shortcomings of this theory whether it be at @xmath1 or at finite temperatures , just because this theory predicts a gapless spectrum .",
    "if anything , this study should give us a fresh impetus to look for a more satisfying theory of bose systems : one that rigorously conserves the number of bosons , and at the same time produces a gapless excitation spectrum .",
    "but then again , such a theory may well turn out to be cumbersome and not be as sleek and elegant as the number non - conserving bogoliubov theory we currently have .",
    "an important lesson of this paper is that there is indeniable value in non field - theoretic , good old first principles calculations . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : canonical ] , it is only when we  looked under the hood , \" in a figurative sense , and analyzed the thermal averaging process using a back to basics , no - nonsense approach based on tracing over actual eigenvalues of the bogoliubov hamiltonian that we discovered the very important fact that field - theoretic formulations of the statistical mechanics of bose systems correspond to an incomplete tracing procedure and are canonical in nature , not grand - canonical as they purport to be .",
    "hence , first principles calculations based on actual eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian should be used , whenever it is possible , as a sanity check to convoluted field - theoretic calculations where the heavy formalism , sophisticated though it is , can conceal seemingly insignificant details which have great physical importance .",
    "it is to be hoped that the ideas presented in this study will help correct common misconceptions about the theories of interacting bosons , hence helping us formulate improved theories for these systems in the future .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly describe how we calculate the expectation value of the total hamiltonian @xmath515 where      in the variational ground state @xmath237 of eq .",
