    "in order to account for cosmic reionization , the mean fraction of ionizing radiation that escapes the galaxy population @xmath7 , needs to be at least 20% ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    in theory , starburst galaxies should be porous to ionizing radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we flux calibrated the images using standard stars ltt 1020 , 6248 and 7987 @xcite .",
    "we note that for the february 2010 observing run , our measured  fluxes are a factor of 23 lower than the  fluxes reported in the literature . a combination of shallower exposure times , combined with errors in the velocity offsets of our central bandpass , wind activity that shifts flux out the narrow mmtf bandpass , and uncertainty in the [ nii ]  correction factors for the literature values , lead to this offset .",
    "however , a comparison with long - slit spectra confirms that the line ratios are sound .    in order to cleanly subtract the continuum from the emission - line images , we first aligned the emission - line and continuum frames using _ iraf _ tasks wregister and imalign .",
    "next , we used psfmatch to convolve the image with the better seeing with the psf from the other .",
    "finally , we used several bright stars in the field and the task mscimatch to determine the proper scaling to match counts in the stars between the images .",

    "this relationship between low optical depth and high outflow velocities further strengthens the argument that lyman continuum escape has a preferred direction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ionization cones exhibit narrow morphologies and subtend an estimated 4% of @xmath115  steradians .",
    "this implies that the covering fraction of escaping radiation will be much less than unity , and is consistent with the results from studies of high redshift star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we note that the narrow ionization cones do not necessarily imply small .",

    "ngc  5253 has the highest , but ngg  3125 has  lower than he  2 - 10 , which is likely optically thick .",
    "one explanation is that the higher sfr in he  2 - 10 contains contamination from its agn .",
    "however , the agn in he  2 - 10 is not particularly luminous in  @xcite making the significance of its contribution unclear .",
    "ngc  1705 has comparatively low .",

    "the comparison between ssfr is similarly fraught .",
    "ngc  5253 and ngc  3125 do have among the highest ssfr , but their ssfrs are not significantly higher than those of the galaxies with optically thick emission .",
    "furthermore , ngc  178 , which does nt have clear evidence for extended emission , has a rather high ssfr .",
    "thus , our small sample supports previous work in its conclusion that strong sfr is necessary but not sufficient for significant  @xcite .",
    "we caution the reader that our sample is small , and the range of star - formation rates is also small .",
    "therefore , our sample does not provide the leverage to firmly establish any apparent correlation between optical depth and  or ssfr . as an additional consequence of the small sample size , the galaxies that seem anomalous , such as ngc 178 with its high ssfr but lack of extended emission and he  2 - 10 , which is optically thick despite its high , may not be significant outliers .",
    "in addition to sfr , the recent star formation history will have an influential role on the escape of ionizing radiation . as a stellar population ages , the rate of ionizing photons produced ( ) decreases and the hardness of the radiation field softens .",
    "the ages of the clusters responsible for the ionization cones in both ngc  5253 and ngc  3125 are between 2 - 5 myr old @xcite .",
    "in contrast with this , ngc  1705 is in a post - burst state ( cluster ages @xmath116 myr ) in which most of the o stars in the main super star clusters have died off @xcite .",
    "thus , the softer and fainter b stars dominate the radiation field and do not provide enough ionizing radiation to allow for escape .",
    "this may similarly offer a partial explanation for the line ratios observed in he  2 - 10 . while the main star forming region , embedded in the center of the galaxy ,",
    "contains many young clusters with ages ranging from 2 - 20 myr @xcite , the second star - forming region , further towards the eastern edge of the galaxy is likely much older with fewer of its massive stars remaining .",
    "furthermore , visual examination of the images of he  2 - 10 show closed bubbles , rather than fractured filaments ( figure [ f : img_he210 ] ) .",
    "we note that for radiation fields dominated by late type stars , the relationship between the ionization parameter map and the optical depth is complicated . in these situations , a transition to [ sii ]  dominated gas does not necessarily indicate an optically thick nebula @xcite .",
    "if the radiation field is soft but sufficiently strong , it is possible that not enough gas is present to absorb the lower energy photons , yet , the ionization parameter map still exhibits a transition zone to [ sii ] .",
    "furthermore , whether the population is a single burst or an extended burst also influences the fate of ionizing radiation . while feedback generates low density passageways in the ism , simulations of superbubble evolution show that there is a delay between superbubble formation and the actual escape of ionizing radiation @xcite . during the phase",
    "prior to superbubble break - out , ionizing radiation gets trapped by the bubble walls @xcite .",
    "once the bubble breaks out of the disk , ionizing radiation may escape relatively unhindered .",
    "however , by this point in time , the rate of ionizing photons produced by the massive star population is considerably weaker than in the first few myr @xcite .",
    "if the starburst occurs over a short duration , essentially a single burst , then it is less likely to leak significant ionizing radiation .",
    "if instead the burst is more extended , the later episodes of star formation can capitalize on the passageways carved by prior star forming episodes .",
    "observationally , @xcite showed that extended bursts with typical timescales of hundreds of myr are common in dwarf starbursts .    our data further support this scenario .",
    "in ngc  5253 , the current burst of star formation occurred within the last 35 myr @xcite .",

    "thus , the ionization cone in ngc  5253 probably formed through low density regions cleared out by feedback from earlier episodes of star formation . in ngc  3125 , the super star cluster at the base of the ionization cone has an age between 13 myr , while the region surrounding it has an overall mean age of between 810 myr @xcite .",
    "while the initial episode of star formation in this burst is younger than that shown for ngc  5253 , the dominant star formation is on the periphery of the galaxy , which makes it easier for ionizing radiation to escape @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite stacked a sample of similar hii galaxies in which ngc  3125 was the dominant source and found that 65% of the stellar population is younger than 5 myr , 32% is between 5 and 100 myr , and the remaining 3% of the population us is older than 100 myr . while the sfh analysis is not based solely on ngc  3125 it does point in the direction of ngc  3125 having multiple recent episodes of star formation .",
    "the young ages of the ionizing populations in ngc  3125 and ngc  5253 may represent a special age range needed to find escaping ionizing radiation . in a recent paper , @xcite study a sample of @xmath117 galaxies whose extremely high [ oiii]/[oii ]  suggest that they are likely optically thin .",
    "these galaxies all have ionizing populations that are between 3 - 5 myr @xcite , similar to the ages observed in galaxies with ionization cones studied in this work .",
    "furthermore , the two local galaxies that have direct  measurements , both have significant populations of young stars @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been suggested that the mass of the galaxy is correlated with the escape fraction of ionizing radiation .",
    "there are some simulations that predict higher  with larger galaxy mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "others claim the opposite because the smaller galaxy s weaker potential well would make escape easier @xcite . based on our small sample here",
    ", we do not find evidence for or against either claim .",
    "the two galaxies for which the extended ionized gas is optically thin have masses that are in the middle to low range of masses in the sample ( tables [ t : props ] and [ t : sfr ] ) .",
    "interesting to note , these two galaxies have significantly higher fractions of hi  relative to the stellar mass of the galaxy ( table [ t : sfr ] ) than the sample galaxies with extended ionized gas .",
    "meanwhile , ngc  5253 has an exceedingly low hi  mass fraction , even when compared to the other galaxies with winds .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the clearing , or consumption , of the neutral gas in the galaxy plays a role in regulating the escape of ionizing radiation .",
    "the passage of ionizing radiation through , and possibly out of , a galaxy has ramifications on our understanding of cosmic reionization . in this paper",
    ", we study the extended , low surface brightness , emission - line gas of seven dwarf starburst galaxies . using narrowband [ siii ] , [ sii ] , and  images and the technique of ionization parameter mapping , we evaluate the optical depth of the extended emission .    in two of the galaxies",
    ", we discover optically thin ionization cones extending along the minor axis .",
    "these cones suggest that ionizing radiation is escaping the main body of the galaxy .",
    "the narrow morphology suggests that ism morphology is a critical determinant of whether ionizing photons will escape a galaxy . in three of the galaxies , we find that the established galactic winds are most likely optically thick .",
    "these galaxies , despite the presence of strong feedback do not show clear evidence for escaping ionizing radiation .",
    "the two remaining galaxies , despite the strong star formation show little evidence of extended emission .",
    "our most convincing examples of optically thin emission are found in narrow ionization cones .",
    "these narrow cones illustrate a scenario in which the covering fraction of lyman continuum is significantly less than unity , as has been suggested by other work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , both cones are aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy , indicating a preferred direction .",
    "the small opening angle and preferred direction suggest that unless the galaxy orientation is such that the axis of escape aligns with the line of sight , it will be challenging to directly detect escaping radiation . if other starbursts are similar to ngc  3125 and ngc  5253 , an orientation bias at least partially explains the low detection rate of ionizing radiation in starburst galaxies and lbgs .",
    "in addition to observational biases , we explore the galactic properties that may regulate the escape of ionizing radiation .",
    "while galactic winds and bubble activity encourage escaping radiation , not all starbursts with galactic wind have escaping lyman continuum .",
    "one explanation is that by the time the bubble or wind breaks out of the ism , the ionizing population has aged and is no longer producing ionizing radiation as prodigiously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the ionizing population is too young to have carved sufficient low - density paths out of the ism for escape .",
    "this suggests an optimal age between 3 - 5 myr for the escape of ionizing radiation .",
    "based on the recent star - formation histories of ngc  3125 and ngc  5253 , a starburst with a few recent star forming episodes strikes the balance between the time it takes for bubbles to burst and maximizing the number of ionizing photons produced that have clear passage out of the galaxy .",
    "another potential contributing factor is the concentration of star formation in the burst . in the examples of optically thin ionization cones",
    ", we see that they emanate from specific , concentrated star forming regions , rather than extended star - forming areas . in contrast , ngc  7126 shows no sign for feedback - driven extended emission , and has its copious star formation spread throughout the disk of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests that concentrated star formation will be more effective at clearing out the ism .",
    "however , we must be careful in drawing strong conclusions from so few objects .",
    "he  2 - 10 and ngg  1705 , which also have concentrated star formation , are most likely optically thick to ionizing radiation .",
    "thus , while the concentration of star formation is important , the interplay between the star formation and the ism morphology most likely regulates the escape of ionizing radiation from starbursts and lyman break galaxies .",
