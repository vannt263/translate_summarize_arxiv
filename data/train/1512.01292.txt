    "photosynthesis in plants and algae is powered by rapid transfer of excitation energy to the reaction center ( rc ) . at full sunlight",
    "intensities the rate of photon capture exceeds the rate of downstream electron transfer catalyzed by the cytochrome b6f complex by a factor of 10 @xcite . in this case , the psii rc becomes over - reduced blocking further photochemistry . as a result ,",
    "damaging processes occur .",
    "in particular , the energy of excess chlorophyll excited states can be used for production of singlet oxygen species which can destroy the photosynthetic organism . to survive intense sunlight fluctuations ,",
    "photosynthetic organisms have evolved many protective strategies , including npq @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "npq is a strategy for partial suppression of the damaging channels .",
    "excessive sunlight energy is transferred into quenching channels , including energy dissipation by the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids .",
    "the initiation of npq includes four main stages : ( 1 ) protonation processes ( on timescales up to a few milliseconds ) which are accompanied by decreasing ph in particular regions of the lhc ; ( 2 ) geometrical reorganizations due to conformational changes of the protein - solvent environment ( on timescales up to a few minutes and more ) ; and ( 3 ) very rapid exciton transfer ( et ) to charge transfer or damaging channels , on timescales up to a few picoseconds .    here , we consider only stage ( 3 ) of the npq process : energy transfer inside the lhc and to the sinks .",
    "the success of npq depends on the efficiency with which energy gets transferred away from damaging processes . in this paper , we ask how this efficiency depends , on one hand , on parameters that can be changed by the plant via adaptation ( mutation ) , and , on the other hand , on noise characteristics of the protein - solvent environment . specifically , we analyze stage ( 3 ) of the npq mechanism in cp29 lhcs of plants and green algae by a charge - transfer state ( cts ) , discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we build on the model developed in @xcite , and demonstrate numerically that the performance of the npq mechanism can be significantly improved by varying ( i ) characteristics of the chlorophyll dimer , ( ii ) resonant properties of protein - solvent interaction , and ( iii ) the et rates to sinks .",
    "our analysis suggests strategies for restoring npq efficiency in response to environmental changes .",
    "energy transfer processes of the npq mechanism can be modeled by describing the sites associated with light - sensitive chlorophyll or carotenoid molecules by discrete excitonic energy states , @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 enumerates the sites of the lhc ) .",
    "both the damaging and the quenching channels can be characterized by their corresponding energy sinks , @xmath2 , that provide independent continuum electron energy spectra @xcite .",
    "these sinks can have very complex structures .",
    "they can be responsible for many quasi - reversible chemical reactions , such as primary charge separation processes in the photosynthetic rcs @xcite , creation of cts and singlet oxygen production @xcite , and coherent quantum effects @xcite even at ambient temperature .",
    "generally , each sink , @xmath2 , is connected to a particular site , @xmath0 .",
    "the energy transfer from this state to its sink is characterized by the corresponding et rate , @xmath3 . for those sites which are not connected to sinks ,",
    "the corresponding et rates vanish .    in our model , five discrete excitonic energy states and two energy sinks",
    "are embedded in a protein - solvent environment .",
    "the environment is modeled by a random telegraph process ( rtp ) .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ m ] . ) for simplicity , we include only the first excited states of the chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules .",
    "more general consideration should also include their long - lived excited states @xcite .",
    "this generalization is straightforward within our framework .    under reasonable assumptions ,",
    "the quantum dynamics of the et can be described by an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath4 , where , @xmath5 is the dressed hamiltonian , and @xmath6 in ( [ ham ] ) , @xmath7 is the renormalized energy of the discrete state , @xmath0 , and the parameter , @xmath3 , in ( [ gamma ] ) is the tunneling rate to the @xmath1-th sink ( only @xmath8 and @xmath9 are included ) .    in our model ,",
    "the dimer , which consists of two chlorophylls , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , each in an excited electron state , participates in the npq process , as described in @xcite .",
    "we use the following notation ( see fig .",
    "[ m ] and @xcite ) : the discrete electron state , @xmath12 , is the excited electron state of @xmath10 .",
    "the discrete electron state , @xmath13 , is the excited electron state of @xmath11 .",
    "the discrete state , @xmath14 , is the heterodimer excited state , where  zea \" denotes the carotenoid zeaxanthin .",
    "the discrete state , @xmath15 , is the cts of the heterodimer .",
    "the sink , @xmath16 , is the continuum part of the cts ( channel ) , associated with dissipation of energy , and thereby suppression of the damaging channel .",
    "the discrete part of the damaging channel is the state , @xmath17 , and the sink , @xmath18 , is the continuum part of the damaging channel .",
    "all matrix elements , @xmath19 , in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) describe interactions between the discrete excitonic states .",
    "each sink is characterized by two parameters : the rate , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , of et into the sink , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , from the corresponding attached discrete state , @xmath17 ( @xmath24 ) , and the efficiency ( cumulative time - dependent probability ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , for the exciton to be absorbed by the corresponding sink .",

    "they do not describe any subsequent chemical reactions that take place in the damaging and the charge - transfer channels . in this sense ,",
    "our model describes only the primary npq processes in the et , and it does not describe the processes which occur in both sinks .",
    "the latter occur on relatively large timescales , and require a detailed knowledge of the structures of the sinks , and additional methods for their analysis .",

    "in particular , for our model ( fig .",
    "[ m ] ) , complete suppression of the damaging channel _ at all times _ occurs if @xmath33 .",
    "this would be the most desirable outcome , leading to maximal effectiveness of the npq mechanism .    in the presence of the protein - solvent noisy environment",

    "what follows , we restrict ourselves to the diagonal noise effects .",
    "( see also @xcite , and references therein . )",

    "generalization to local protein - solvent environments can be done following @xcite .",

    "two orbitals ( eigenfunctions ) of the dimer , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , are close to the unperturbed site states , @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .",

    "[ b6a ] corresponds to the weakly coupled chlorophyll dimer , @xmath65 ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) with a relatively high rate to the damaging sink , @xmath92 , and resonant environmental noise applied to the dimer @xmath93 . in this case",
    ", the asymptotic efficiency of the npq is relatively small , @xmath94 .",
    "this means that @xmath95 of the photosynthetic organisms die in this regime .",

    "this suggests that ph - dependent modifications of the choroiphyll dimer coupling in cp29 could restore npq efficiency in response to environment changes .",
    "imagine that the cp29 dimer operates with weak coupling and large @xmath8 , under non - resonant noise , where the npq efficiency is @xmath104 ( corresponding to the green curve in fig .",
    "[ b6a ] ) . now",
    ", suppose that the protein - solvent environment experiences a modification which results in resonant noise on the dimer @xmath93 .",
    "this modification increases the et rate to the damaging channel , @xmath18 , and , correspondingly , decreases the npq efficiency to @xmath110 ( red curve in fig .",
    "[ b6a ] ) .",
    "this effect could then be counteracted by switching to strong dimer coupling and lower @xmath8 , thereby restoring the efficiency to @xmath111 .",
    "as we discussed above , efficiency would be partially restored by a transition from weakly to strongly coupled chlorophyll - based dimer .",
    "this transformation increases the npq efficiency , @xmath88 , by @xmath112 ( red - dotted curve , @xmath98 ) .",
    "another way is to keep the weakly coupled dimer , @xmath65 , but to decrease the et rate , @xmath8 , to the damaging channel , which improves the npq efficiency to @xmath113 .",
    "we demonstrated that the efficiency of the charge - transfer nonphotochemical quenching in cp29 can be improved by transformation from a weakly to a strongly coupled @xmath114 dimer .",
    "this transformation could be related to the npq mechanism by the cts discussed in @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrated strategies for restoring the npq efficiency when the environment changes .",
    "we analyzed numerically only a limited number of the possible system - environment scenarios .",
    "many additional considerations and generalizations can be studied using our approach .",
    "the mathematical advantages of our approach are that it ( i ) allowed us to derive an exact and closed system of ordinary differential equations , which is easy to analyze and to solve numerically and ( ii ) does not require the use of small parameters and uncontrolled perturbative techniques .",

    "in particular , the experimental verification of possible mechanisms of transformation from a weakly to a strongly coupled chlorophyll - based dimer , in the npq regime , would be of significant interest .",
