    "many late - type m dwarfs ( @xmath3 m4 ) have strong magnetic fields that can exceed 1 kg and heat their stellar chromospheres and coronae , creating `` magnetic activity '' that is observed from the radio to the x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , given their fully convective interiors , late - type m dwarfs serve as important laboratories for studying magnetic dynamo generation in stellar ( and potentially planetary ) environments and are vital for understanding the role that various stellar properties play in the magnetic field and activity generation in low - mass stars .    in solar - type stars , magnetic field generation and subsequent heating",
    "is closely tied to stellar rotation ; the faster a star rotates , the stronger its magnetic heating and surface activity .",
    "angular momentum loss from magnetized winds slows rotation in solar - type stars , and as a result , magnetic activity decreases with age .",

    "the finite active lifetimes of early - type m dwarfs observed in nearby clusters suggest that age continues to play an important role in the rotation and magnetic activity evolution of low - mass stars @xcite .    at a spectral type of about m4 ,",
    "stars become fully convective ( 0.35 m@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",

    "magnetic activity persists in late - type m dwarfs ; the fraction of active m dwarfs peaks around a spectral type of m7 before decreasing into the brown dwarf regime @xcite .",
    "several studies have demonstrated that the large fraction of late - type m dwarfs observed to be active is likely a result of their long activity lifetimes @xcite .",
    "using 37,845 m dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite found that stars farther from the galactic plane were less likely to be magnetically active ( as traced by h@xmath0 ) than those near the plane .",
    "they interpreted the change in activity fraction as an effect of age : as stars pass through the galactic plane , they are dynamically heated by gravitational interactions and obtain orbits that take them farther from the plane .",
    "therefore , stars close to the galactic plane are statistically younger , while stars farther away are statistically older .",
    "@xcite quantified this `` galactic stratigraphy '' using a 1d dynamical model and derived the h@xmath0 activity lifetimes for m0-m7 dwarfs , finding that early - type m dwarfs ( with both radiative and convection zones ) have active lifetimes of 12 gyr , while late - type m dwarfs ( with fully convective interiors ) have active lifetimes that exceed 7 gyr .",
    "the level of activity ( as quantified by the ratio of the luminosity in h@xmath0 to the bolometric luminosity  @xmath6/@xmath7 ) also appears to decrease as a function of stratigraphic age for all m dwarfs ( early and late - type ) , confirming that an age ",
    "activity relation persists into the fully - convective regime @xcite .",
    "tying activity ( and age ) to rotation for late - type m dwarfs has been more challenging .",
    "recent simulations of dynamos find that rotation may play a significant role in the magnetic field generation of fully convective stars @xcite . from a simple analytical model , @xcite",
    "suggest that the age - rotation relation extends to late - type m dwarfs and that the angular momentum evolution of all stars is more a function of stellar radius than it is interior structure .",
    "indeed , a few empirical studies have uncovered evidence that activity and rotation might be linked in late - type m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of the observations have relied on high - resolution spectroscopic data , which measure the rotational velocity modified by the inclination of the star ( @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 ) .",
    "while @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 measurements provide important clues to the underlying stellar rotation , they have a couple of limitations : 1 ) the best spectrographs can produce @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 values only down to about 1 km  s@xmath8 , which for a 0.2 r@xmath5 star corresponds to a rotation period of 10 days , and are therefore completely insensitive to slowly rotating stars ; and 2 ) the inclination dependence adds significant scatter to the derived rotation velocities .",
    "previous results demonstrate these limitations by showing that almost all late - type m dwarfs with a detected @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 have the same `` saturated '' level of magnetic activity ; slowly rotating m dwarfs with potentially less magnetic activity are not detectable .",
    "an alternative method for studying stellar rotation is to use photometrically derived rotation periods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "periodic signals result from brightness variations caused by long - lived spots on the stellar surface rotating in and out of view .",
    "while @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 observations require a single spectroscopic observation , observing periodic , photometric variability requires numerous , high - cadence observations that have been historically prohibitive for large samples of late - type m dwarfs .",
    "however , recent programs to search for transiting planets around late - type m dwarfs have produced large catalogs of time - domain photometry from which can be gleaned several important stellar properties , including rotation periods @xcite .",
    "one of these transit programs , the mearth project @xcite , is employing two arrays of robotic telescopes to photometrically monitor 4,000 nearby , mid - to - late m dwarfs .",
    "mearth data and associated observations have provided new measurements of the fundamental properties of nearby mid - to - late m dwarfs , including their distances @xcite and their near - infrared spectra @xcite .",
    "early in the survey , @xcite determined photometric rotation periods ( ranging from 0.28 to 154 days ) for 41 of the mearth m dwarfs with known parallaxes , and identified a relationship between these rotation periods and kinematic age . as the mid - to - late m dwarfs observed by mearth are nearby and therefore relatively bright , it is possible to obtain a larger sample of optical spectroscopy to probe magnetic activity , thus enabling a robust investigation of how the rotation - activity relation for fully convective m dwarfs extends to slowly rotating stars .",
    "determining ages for stars can be particularly challenging , especially for low - mass stars @xcite . in the past",
    ", age - dependent relations for stars have been calibrated using stellar clusters .",
    "however , the faintness of m dwarfs and the large distances to stellar clusters with ages @xmath3 1 gyr preclude any detailed observations of low - mass stars in the cluster environment .",
    "one alternative method for probing stellar age is to use the 3d stellar kinematics of a population .",
    "historically , the dynamics of stars have been used to estimate ages , as dynamical interactions cause the orbits of older stars to become more elliptical and inclined to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "specifically , stars that exhibit larger velocity dispersions have likely experienced more dynamical encounters with molecular clouds and/or other stars and are therefore older .",
    "this is particularly true in the vertical or @xmath9 direction of stellar motion since most stars begin their lives in the galactic disk and slowly diffuse away via dynamical heating @xcite .",
    "older stars also have slower azimuthal or @xmath10 mean velocities due to asymmetric drift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while using stellar kinematics to determine ages of individual stars is highly problematic ( since the dynamical processes that affect individual stellar orbits are stochastic ) , 3d motions can reveal important age information for bulk populations . dynamical analyses do require large samples , which until recently have not been available for late - type m dwarfs .    in this paper , we use an expanded sample of mearth rotation periods for nearby m dwarfs , new optical spectroscopy of these targets , and their full space motions to investigate the rotation - activity and rotation - activity - age relation for late - type m dwarfs .",
    "section 2 describes the determination of rotation periods from mearth data and the determination of magnetic activity from optical spectroscopic observations .",
    "we describe the rotation , activity and kinematic analysis in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we demonstrate that there is a close tie between rotation and activity and that the slowest rotators come from a dynamically older population .",

    "the mearth m dwarf light curves used in this paper ( along with the full mearth sample ) are publicly available for download from the mearth website .",
    "the sample of m dwarfs observed by mearth was designed to maximize sensitivity to the detection of small transiting planets ( @xmath11 ) , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the mearth sample is heavily biased toward mid - to - late m dwarfs within 33pc , with most stars having spectral types of m4-m6 but also including several stars of earlier and later spectral types .",
    "this paper makes use of the mearth sample of stars and inherits the selection criteria of the planet - search survey . while the sample of stars observed was not designed explicitly to probe rotation across the entire m dwarf spectral class , it spans a sufficient range of spectral types to enable interesting comparisons between earlier ( which in this paper refers primarily to m3-m4 ) and later ( primarily m5-m6 ) spectral types .",
    "the mearth telescopes are 40 cm in diameter and equipped with back - illuminated ccds .",
    "the telescopes observe automatically whenever conditions allow , with an adaptive scheduling algorithm selecting targets from a prioritized queue .",
    "the rotation periods in this paper are derived from `` planet cadence '' observations , in which a star is observed once every @xmath12 minutes for at least one observational season , resulting in light curves containing from hundreds up to a few thousand data points . for some stars , up to three observational seasons contributed to the rotation analysis .",
    "we took care to minimize changes to the telescopes to preserve long term stability , but those changes that were necessary are summarized in @xcite and documented in detail in the notes associated with the mearth data releases .    the mearth - north bandpass is fixed and nearly identical across the eight telescopes .",
    "designed to maximize photon flux from red m dwarf targets , the bandpass is wide and has a shape set at short wavelengths by a longpass filter that cuts on at 715 nm and at long wavelengths by the quantum efficiency of the ccd , which decreases significantly by about 1000 nm . the time - variable optical depth through strong telluric water vapor features that fall within the mearth bandpass can cause systematic photometric trends in mearth m dwarf light curves , but the effect can be mitigated through an empirical correction @xcite .",
    "photometric modulations due to rotating starspots are relatively muted in the mearth bandpass compared to bluer wavelengths , but they can still have readily detectable peak - to - peak amplitudes of up to several percent @xcite .",
    "rotation periods were extracted using a weighted least - squares periodogram fitting algorithm that corrects for and marginalizes over systematic photometric trends , including those caused by varying telluric water absorption .",
    "this analysis is described in detail in @xcite . whereas @xcite included rotation periods only for stars with published literature parallaxes , here we extend the sample to all m dwarfs with rotational modulations detectable in the mearth photometry that were available up to 2011 , resulting in 164 targets . for this paper",
    "s analysis , we applied a two - tier classification system ( `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' ) for all of the measured rotation periods , with `` 1 '' being the most robust detections . some of the reasons that rotation periods were given a classification of `` 2 '' were if the stars had long periods and less than two complete cycles were observed or if the stars had larger uncertainties in the phase folding procedure .",

    "the inactive stars in both panels corroborate that rotation plays an important role in the generation of magnetic activity in m dwarfs and hint at the possibility of a rotation threshold faster than which magnetic activity is present .",
    "all m dwarfs rotating faster than 26 days and 86 days in the early - type and late - type populations respectively are magnetically active .",
    "velocities ( top ) , and @xmath9 velocity dispersions ( bottom ) as a function of rotation period .",
    "error bars represent the 1@xmath20 uncertainties in each bin .",
    "both panels suggest that slowly rotating m dwarfs are drawn from an older kinematic population.,width=336 ]    figures [ fig : actrot_nobin ] and [ fig : actrot ] also demonstrate an alternative method for studying the range of magnetic activity strengths in m dwarfs .",
    "our results reduce the contribution of different rotation periods to the spread of activity strength and allowed us to examine the intrinsic spread of the population ( at a given rotation rate ) , particularly for early - type m dwarfs .",
    "while the mean values have relatively small uncertainties ( wide error bars ) in most bins , the spread ( thin error bars ) at each rotation bin remains large ( typically about 0.30.5 dex ) .",
    "we see that mixing stars of various rotation rates ( and perhaps different ages ) _ does _ increase the spread of the population ( particularly for early - type m dwarfs ) .",
    "additionally , some of the spread seen in individual bins in figure [ fig : actrot ] indicate that the m dwarf population has a significant intrinsic variety of activity strengths . as has been seen in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much of the observed spread may be due to the h@xmath0 variability of individual m dwarfs .      from the results of the kinematic analysis described in section 3.2",
    ", we examined the bulk motions of the sample as a function of rotation period .",
    "figure [ fig : velmean ] shows the mean @xmath10 velocity ( top ) and the @xmath9 velocity dispersion ( bottom ) of the entire sample ( relative to the local standard of rest ) as a function of rotation period .",
    "the @xmath10 component of the velocity ( in the direction of galactic rotation ) shows clear signs of increasing asymmetric drift with increasing rotation period .",
    "namely , the mean @xmath10 velocity decreases for stars with slow rotation rates .",
    "this decrease is a strong indicator that the population of slow rotators is older ; dynamical heating over time causes elliptical orbits , which lead to a bulk decrease in @xmath10 motion .",
    "the mean @xmath18 and @xmath9 motions are insensitive to asymmetric drift and provide little information about the ages of small samples of stars .",
    "all of the population @xmath18 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 values ( means and dispersions ) are included in table [ table : kinematics ] for completeness .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the @xmath9 component ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : velmean ] ; in the vertical direction , out of the plane of the galaxy ) increases with increasing stellar rotation period .",
    "increases in the vertical velocity dispersion are typically associated with multiple dynamical encounters and older ages .",
    "as with the asymmetric drift apparent in the mean velocities , the vertical velocity dispersion measurements suggest that the slower rotators are dynamically older .",
    "the dispersions of the @xmath18 and @xmath10 components can be affected by other processes and are less directly linked to dynamical heating than the @xmath9 velocity dispersions , but are also included in table [ table : kinematics ] .",
    "we also completed the same kinematic analysis for separated late - type and early - type populations and found no significant differences in their kinematics .",
    "the spectroscopic follow - up of 238 m dwarfs , combined with the rotation rates from the mearth transit survey has provided an unprecedented sample for examining the rotation , magnetic activity and kinematics of mid - to - late m dwarfs .",
    "we conducted an analysis of the magnetic activity properties and investigated the bulk 3d kinematics of the population as a function of rotation . in the spectroscopic sample ,",
    "164 stars have measured rotation periods , 160 are magnetically active , and 127 of the m dwarfs are both active and have measured rotation periods .",
    "we provide all of the sample and derived quantities in the electronic version of this manuscript .      1",
    ".   for early - type m dwarfs , the activity fractions decrease with increasing rotation period . for the late - type m dwarfs ,",
    "the higher activity fractions extend to slower rotation rates before rapidly declining .",
    "2 .   all of the rapidly rotating stars are magnetically active , with few ( but some ) of the slowest rotators showing signs of activity .",
    "3 .   for early - type ( m1-m4 ) m dwarfs ,",
    "all stars rotating faster than 26 days are magnetically active , as are all late - type m dwarfs ( m5-m8 ) with rotation periods shorter than 86 days .",
    "it is worth noting that for a 0.2 m@xmath5 star , 26 and 86 days correspond to @xmath1  sin  @xmath2 values of 0.4 and 0.1 km  s@xmath8 respectively , both of which are below the detection limits of most spectrographs .",
    "4 .   at the longest rotation periods , we see no active early - type m dwarfs , but there are a few slowly rotating , active , late - type m dwarfs .",
    "5 .   the strength of magnetic activity appears to decline with increased rotation period in early - type m dwarfs .",
    "the fully - convective , late - type m dwarfs remain at a similar activity level as rotation slows , perhaps until the slowest rotation periods ( @xmath3 90 days )",
    ". 6 .   from our kinematic analysis",
    ", it appears that m dwarfs with longer rotation periods are drawn from a kinematically older population .",
    "specifically , we see that slowly rotating stars exhibit signs of asymmetric drift and have larger velocity dispersions about the mid - plane , both signs of dynamically heated , older populations .",
    "there are a few slowly rotating m dwarfs that show signs of magnetic activity , and which may provide important laboratories for additional investigations about the role rotation plays in the magnetic field generation in low - mass stars .    in general",
    ", we find a strong relationship between rotation and activity for early - type m dwarfs .",
    "the relationship is much less pronounced , but appears to exist for the late - type m dwarfs that are fully convective . for",
    "all m dwarfs , rotation appears to affect the presence of activity ; fast rotators are more likely to show strong activity , while slow rotators are less likely to be active .",
    "however , in the late - type m dwarfs , magnetic activity appears to be present in stars with slower rotation than their early - type counterparts .",
    "larger samples that include measurements of magnetic activity and rotation are required to further investigate this discrepancy ( e.g. newton et al . in prep ) .",
    "our kinematic analysis suggests that rotation is linked to age in all m dwarfs .",
    "we conclude that younger m dwarfs ( both early and late - type ) are rotating faster and more likely to be active . future analysis of wide binaries ( particularly those with a white dwarf companion from which we can determine age ) and/or stellar clusters will provide better information about the detailed role that stellar age plays in the observed rotation and magnetic activity of low - mass stars .",
    "while our kinematic analysis shows clear signs of asymmetric drift and dynamical heating , the magnitudes of the effects are far less than what is seen in large samples of m dwarfs that probe farther into the milky way disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the slow rotators in our sample are older than the fast rotators , but that they are still younger than typical old stellar populations in the galactic ( thin ) disk .",
    "this is not surprising given that the mearth targets are selected to be nearby , where it is much more likely to sample a younger population @xcite .",
    "some of the active stars in our spectroscopic sample do not have measured rotation periods ( 21% ) and were therefore not included in some of our analyses .",
    "74 stars in the sample do not have rotation periods ( 55% of which are inactive ) . because our ability to measure a rotation rate of an m dwarf depends on the presence of starspots , it is not surprising that some stars , namely the inactive ones , may not show rotational modulation ; indeed , the majority of the stars with rotation periods are active ( 77% ) .",
    "however , the lack of measured rotation in the active stars could be due to a number of effects , including but not limited to , homogeneous spot geometry , short - lived spots , insensitivity to low - amplitude variations ( few small spots ) , or an over abundance of spots .",
    "the latter effect would cause a decrease in the rotational modulation for the most active ( heavily spotted ) stars .",
    "we ran the non - rotating stars through our kinematic analysis ( 53 have 3d kinematics ) and found that as a population they are consistent with m dwarfs in the 10 - 100 day rotation bins .",
    "we conclude that kinematically , the stars without rotation measurements could be on the older end of the spectrum for our sample",
    ". the active fractions of early and late - type m dwarfs without rotations measurements are consistent with the entire sample in the 10 - 100 day rotation bins .",
    "therefore , the exclusion of the active stars without rotation measurements does not likely effect our results , but may be explored in a future study when we can ascertain the reason for the lack of rotational modulation .",
    "the fact that there are a small number of active , slowly rotating , late - type m dwarfs in our sample suggests that the activity - rotation relation may be more complicated than predicted by a simple spin - down model .",
    "one possibility could be that while persistent magnetic activity in late - type m dwarfs is rare ( or non - existent ) for slow rotators , the presence of magnetic cycles may produce observed activity in a small number of stars at any given time .",
    "long - term observations are required to further test this hypothesis .",
    "the small number of active , slowly rotating , late - type m dwarfs could also be due to the young bias of mearth , which might exclude such stars .",
    "an additional factor that could influence our analysis is the potential presence of close binary companions , which have been shown to affect the magnetic activity ( and rotation ) of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while multiplicity likely plays a minor role due to the small binary fraction of m dwarfs @xcite , high resolution imaging and/or spectroscopy would be required to further investigate its role .",
    "our analysis divided m dwarfs into early ( m1-m4 ) and late - types ( m5-m8 ) and did not explore the ramifcations of altering the boundary between the two populations .",
    "ideally , we would conduct the analysis as a function of spectral type but we did not have enough stars in each spectral type to produce a statistically significant result . as stated above , our analysis is therefore mostly a comparison between m3-m4 and m5-m6 dwarfs . future and ongoing studies will provide additional time - series photometric data with which we can further study the rotation and activity behavior of m dwarfs ( over a larger range of spectral types ) , both surveys such as mearth ( both north and south ; * ? ? ?",
