    "recent advances in observational cosmology @xcite have revived interest in alternative theories of gravity in which the gravitational interaction is modified in the infrared domain and which could  potentially  explain the accelerated expansion of the universe without introducing the dark energy and matter components .",
    "theoretical consistency and existing experimental data impose severe constraints on such models .",
    "different approaches to the problem have been discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , and refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "one of them employs spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry by space - time dependent condensates of scalar fields @xcite coupled to gravity in a covariant way via a derivative coupling .",
    "the resulting theory may have a non - pathological perturbative behavior about the broken vacuum @xcite and exhibit modifications of gravitational interactions at large scales ( see sect .  [",
    "sc : intro - model ] for more details ) .",
    "in particular , graviton may acquire a non - zero mass , which is the reason to call these models massive gravity models .",
    "existing experimental data constrain the mass of the graviton and other parameters of massive gravity models .",
    "absence of lorentz invariance makes the constraints weaker than one would expect in a lorentz - invariant theory : the newton s potential remains unmodified in the linear approximation despite non - zero graviton mass @xcite , so that solar system constraints are satisfied for rather large masses .",
    "the constraint on the mass of the graviton comes from the emission of gravitational waves by binary pulsars which is responsible for their spin - down @xcite .",
    "consistency of observations with gr requires the graviton mass to be smaller than the inverse period of orbital motion of the binary system , that is @xcite @xmath2 standard cosmological solutions may be reproduced in massive gravity @xcite .",
    "further constraints on the parameters of the model are imposed by the growth of perturbations and structure formation in the post - inflationary epoch @xcite .    in general relativity ( gr ) , a crucial role is played by the spherically symmetric vacuum solution to the einstein equations  the schwarzschild solution .",
    "this role is twofold : first , this solution describes the metric outside of spherical non - rotating bodies and gives rise , in the weak field limit , to the newtonian gravity .",
    "it provides therefore a useful approximation in many astrophysical situations .",
    "second , the schwarzschild solution describes the result of a gravitational collapse , the black hole .",
    "although the existence of black holes has not yet been directly confirmed , there exists an indirect evidence that some of binary stellar systems contain black holes as one of the companion @xcite , and that many galaxies , including the milky way , harbor super - massive black holes in their centers @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that black holes will be directly observed in the near future , and that their properties , including the metric configuration near the horizon , will be quantitatively tested @xcite , thus providing a probe of gr in a fully non - linear regime .",
    "the schwarzschild metric , together with properly arranged scalar fields is a solution to einstein equations in massive gravity as well @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of black holes are , in general , expected to be different . in particular , rotating black holes are certainly modified , and , more generally , black holes are expected to have hair @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of black hole hair in massive gravity models suggests that there might exist spherically symmetric solutions other than the schwarzschild one . in this paper",
    "we construct explicit examples of such solutions .",
    "we found a new class of vacuum spherically - symmetric solutions in massive gravity which depend , in addition to the mass @xmath0 ( equivalently , the schwarzschild radius ) , on one more parameter which we call the `` scalar charge '' @xmath1 . at zero value of this parameter",
    "the standard schwarzschild solution is recovered , while at non - zero values of @xmath1 the schwarzschild metric gets modified .",
    "the modified solution is non - linear at all distances ; it can not be obtained in the linear approximation .",
    "similar phenomenon has been previously found in the context of bi - gravity models @xcite .",
    "the new solutions may have event horizons and are , therefore , candidates for modified black holes .",
    "we found both analytical and numerical examples of such modified black holes .",
    "the analytical solutions found in a particular massive gravity model show a variety of different behaviors . depending on the parameters of the model , the deviation of the metric from the minkowski one may decay at infinity as @xmath3 or slower .",
    "the solutions thus may have finite or infinite adm @xcite mass , respectively . in the case of a finite mass",
    ", this mass may be positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath0 . in either case",
    "the singularity at the origin may be hidden by the horizon . the solutions with negative mass exhibit an anti - gravitating behavior at large distances from the center .",
    "the modified gravitational potential may decay slower than @xmath3 in a certain distance range .",
    "such a behavior would mimic the effect of the dark matter .",
    "interestingly , the modification depends not only on the parameters of the model , but also on the scalar charge and the mass of the solution .",
    "thus , the apparent amount of the `` dark matter '' may be different for objects of the same mass , in contrast with other models of modified gravity .",

    "for other values of @xmath24 the behavior of the perturbations may or may not reproduce that of gr depending on the initial conditions .",

    "in particular :    * if @xmath157 , the newtonian potential @xmath158 is attractive at short distances and becomes repulsive at larger distances ; * if @xmath159 and @xmath160 , the newtonian potential is attractive outside of the horizon , and becomes repulsive close to the singularity .",

    "the schwarzschild solution is recovered at @xmath161 .",
    "to summarize , there exist spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in massive gravity models which depend on two integration constants , the mass @xmath0 and an extra parameter @xmath1 which can be called the `` scalar charge '' . at zero value of the scalar charge",
    "the standard schwarzschild solution is recovered , while at non - zero @xmath1 the metric is modified with respect to the schwarzschild case .",
    "the solutions having non - zero scalar charge exhibit much reacher behavior than the schwarzschild solution in gr . as can be seen from the explicit example of sect .",
    "[ sc : xw ] , both the short and long distance behavior may be modified depending on the parameters of the model .    unlike in general relativity , the solutions may have a _ negative _ adm mass .",
    "such solutions have repulsive gravitational interaction at large distances . at short distances",
    "the repulsion may change to attraction and give rise to the horizon , hiding the singularity at the origin .",
    "such solutions represent anti - gravitating black holes .    in the case of a positive adm mass",
    ", the @xmath1-dependent contributions may make the gravitational attraction weaker at short distances ( cf .",
    "[ fig:1]-(a ) ) . in this case",
    "the gravitational force decays with distance slower than @xmath162 , thus mimicking the presence of dark matter .",
    "interestingly , solutions with the same value of @xmath0 but different scalar charge @xmath1 have different behavior , which corresponds to different amount of the apparent `` dark matter '' .",
    "this is in contrast with other models possessing modifications of the gravitational potential @xcite , where the modification of the gravitational force is determined by the parameters of the model .",
    "it is currently an open question how objects with non - zero scalar charge may be created . as has been argued in sect .",
    "[ sec : grav - field - star ] , the absence of direct coupling between the goldstone fields and ordinary matter results in zero scalar charges of static matter distributions .",
    "thus , the gravitational field of ordinary stars is described by the @xmath92 solutions , i.e. , by the standard schwarzschild metric .",
    "this may be not the case for black holes , especially the super - massive black holes in the centers of galaxies , which may be of primordial origin @xcite . in any case",
    ", this question requires further investigation .",
    "another open question is the stability of the modified black hole solutions .",
    "several kinds of instabilities may be present . among perturbations of the solutions there may exist unstable modes with the characteristic time scale of order of the horizon size ; in this case the interpretation in terms of black holes is not possible .",
    "second potential source of problems is generic presence of the higher - derivative terms not included in the action ( [ eq : action ] ) .",
    "one has to check that the 2-parameter family of modified black holes survives their inclusion . by analogy with the ghost condensate case",
    ", one may expect that these terms produce at least a slow jeans - type instability @xcite , which is not , however , dangerous for the black hole interpretation .",
    "finally , the presence of negative mass solutions may lead to instabilities of the quantum - mechanical nature similar to those found in ref.@xcite .    to conclude this list ,",
    "let us mention also the solutions satisfying @xmath163 which were not considered in this paper .",
    "in this case the ten einstein equations reduce to three equations for @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath68 which form a ( generically ) well - defined system .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this system has asymptotically flat solutions . in any case",
