    "when a conduction electron or hole moves through a polar crystal it polarizes and distorts the neighboring ion lattice sites .",
    "when it moves it carries along with it the lattice distortion .",
    "the electron together with this lattice distortion or self - consistent polarization field is a quasi particle and is referred to as polaron .",
    "many experiments indicate strong evidence of polaronic carriers in strongly correlated electronic materials like manganites ( showing colossal magneto - resistance ) @xcite-@xcite , organic @xcite and high @xmath0 superconducting cuprates @xcite-@xcite .",
    "holstein model@xcite has been one of the basic model used to study the formation and nature of polaron .",
    "analytical approaches to solve the model have got limited success .",
    "main draw back of those results are they are valid only in a limited range of parametric regime of electron - phonon coupling @xcite and also for small system size .",
    "recently there has been a spurt in numerical studies on this model , which includes the variational approach based on exact diagonalization method ( vaed ) @xcite-@xcite , the density - matrix renormalization group techniques ( dmrg ) @xcite , exact diagonalization techniques(ed ) @xcite-@xcite , the quantum monte carlo calculations ( qmc ) @xcite-@xcite and global - local method @xcite .",
    "none of these methods work equally well in all parametric regimes .",
    "each has some shortcomings .",
    "vaed , the most recent and successful of the methods , though highly accurate in the the weak and intermediate coupling regimes , fails to maintain its accuracy in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the dmrg method is accurate in the strong and intermediate coupling regimes , but is not accurate in the weak coupling regime .",
    "the dmrg results are not translationally symmetric .",
    "dmrg lacks the accuracy of vaed in the weak coupling regime because its lattice size is smaller than the spatial extent of the large polaron that will be formed .",
    "the vaed can not emulate its success of the low and intermediate regime in the the strong coupling regime because the electron - phonon system demands more phonons in its ` root state ' @xcite and its near vicinity .",
    "disordered holstein model has been earlier attempted by @xcite using dynamical cpa . but",
    "their method is effective in the intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime and for only infinite coordination , i.e. on a bethe lattice . keeping this in mind , in this communication",
    "we have proposed a reciprocal space recursion technique , introduced earlier by us in a different context @xcite , as a feasible method for the study of the holstein model .",
    "we have constructed a basis which meets the requirement in _ all _ parametric regimes .",
    "in this section we shall describe the setting up of the electron - phonon hamiltonian as an operator on the underlying hilbert space .",
    "the electronic part will be represented in a tight - binding like basis . in our simple model",
    "there will be only a single orbital per site and the tight - binding basis will be labeled by a site @xmath1 : @xmath2 .",
    "this basis will span the electronic part of the hilbert space @xmath3 .",
    "the phonon part will be described by a _ configuration state _ which will indicate how many phonon excitations there are at each _ site _ labeled by @xmath1 .",
    "configuration _ will be a pattern of the type @xmath4 where @xmath5 takes the values @xmath6 and is called the _ cardinality _ of the site @xmath1 .",
    "the pattern is called the _",
    "cardinality sequence _ and uniquely labels a phonon state .",
    "these states will span the phonon part of the hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "the total hilbert space of states of the electron - phonon system will be @xmath8 .",
    "a member of the basis in this product space will be labeled _ both _ by the site labeled real - space part and a configuration part which tells us how many local phononic excitations are there at _ each _ site in the lattice , e.g. @xmath9 .    in this basis ,",
    "the holstein hamiltonian @xcite is :    @xmath10    where ,    * @xmath11 is the projection operator @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the transfer operator in the electronic part of the hilbert space @xmath3 , * @xmath14 are the step up or step down operators and @xmath15 is the number operator @xmath16 both in the phononic part of the hilbert space @xmath7 . * here a single electron with an on - site energy @xmath17 can hop to its near neighbour on an infinite lattice with hopping integral @xmath18 and interacts with dispersion less optical phonons with frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling strength is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the parameters @xmath17,@xmath18 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 have the units of energy .",
    "* in all subsequent calculations energies are scaled in units of t.    this type of hamiltonian in an augmented space @xmath22 has been introduced earlier by us @xcite to deal with time dependent disorder in an electronic system , precisely of the form produced by lattice vibrations .",
    "the great advantage of this formulation is that if we have quenched disorder in @xmath23 , then a simple augmentation of the hilbert space @xmath3 by the configuration space of the @xmath23 allows us to deal with all the configuration averaged properties of a disordered holstein model .",
    "this extension will be carried out by us in a later section .",
    "since we are interested in calculating the spectral function , dispersion curves of the system , we generalize the above mentioned formalism to generate basis states in reciprocal space . here a general state in the augmented reciprocal - space basis has the following form : @xmath24 is a reciprocal space vector and we have fourier transformed the electronic part of the basis to momentum space keeping the bosonic part unchanged . in the recursion method , which we shall later employ , we shall generate the basis states by repeatedly applying the hamiltonian on the following starting state :    @xmath25    here @xmath26 denotes a zero phonon configuration in the bosonic subspace of the full hamiltonian .",
    "that is , with a null cardinality sequence .",
    "alternatively , we can generate basis states recursively by similar action of the hamiltonian on the following two states :    1 .",
    "@xmath25 2 .",
    "@xmath27    here @xmath28 denotes @xmath29 number of phonon at site @xmath30 of the bosonic subspace of the hamiltonian and zero else where .",
    "we shall call this the phonon - enriched state .",
    "the advantage of the second choice is that , if we apply the hamiltonian @xmath31 times on the two initial states , @xmath32 number of phonons are generated in the site @xmath30 and sufficient number of bosons are generated in its vicinity , while in the first choice we get only @xmath31 number of phonons in the first site and progressively less numbers in the neighboring sites .",
    "this is important in order to get a convergent result in the high e - ph coupling regime .    in order to calculate",
    "averaged spectral function we tri - diagonalize the hamiltonian using the following three term recursion  :    we start from a state @xmath33 and generate the other states through the following three term recursion  :    @xmath34    the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 are obtained by ensuring that the new basis generated is orthogonal .",
    "this yields  :    @xmath37    to carry out the recursion we need to know the action of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) on a general _ state _  : if write the hamiltonian ( 1 ) as : @xmath38 then @xmath39    once we carry out a recursive determination of the coefficients @xmath40 , the green function is given as a continued fraction  :    @xmath41 we carry out recursion up to a finite number of n steps and then terminate the continued fraction with a herglotz terminator @xmath42 @xcite suggested by beer and pettifor @xcite .",
    "the spectral function is then given by :    @xmath43    the dispersion curves are obtained by fitting lorentzian s in the neighbourhood of the peaks in the spectral function : the lorentzian centre gives the energy @xmath44 while the width gives the width in the dispersion curves .",
    "we apply the recursion based conjugate gradient ( cg ) technique @xcite to obtain ground state energy and wave function . to calculate the excited state wave function",
    "we find a orthogonal state to the ground state using gram - schmidt method of orthogonalization and then apply cg technique to find the first excited state energy and wave function . with the wave function and dispersion curve at our disposal we find the various correlation functions , effective mass from it .",
    "the effective mass we have calculated using the standard formula :    @xmath45    the mean phonon number indicates a measure of the phononic character of the polaron . @xmath46    here @xmath47 is the ground state wave function obtained from the cg technique .",
    "the static correlation function between the electron position and oscillator displacement is given    @xmath48    the number of excited phonons in the vicinity of the electron is given by    @xmath49",
    "in this section we shall generalize our ideas to a disordered holstein model .",
    "we shall start with a hamiltonian :    @xmath50    where , @xmath51    here @xmath52 is a random variable which takes the value 0 if @xmath1 is occupied by an a type of atom and 1 if it is occupied by a b type .",
    "the probability of these events are @xmath53 ( the concentration of a atoms in the alloy ) and @xmath54 ( concentration of b atoms in the alloy ) respectively . in this simple model",
    "we shall consider only this type of binary substitutional disorder .",
    "for real disordered alloys the other parameters @xmath18 , @xmath55 and @xmath20 may also be random .",
    "the augmented space formalism for quenched disorder @xcite writes the probability density of the random variables as :    @xmath56 & = & x\\ \\delta[n(r_n ) -1 ] + ( 1-x)\\ \\delta[n(r_n ) ] \\\\",

    "we consider the configuration space of _ all _ the variables @xmath66 : @xmath67 . the augmented space formalism @xcite constructs a hamiltonian :    @xmath68    where ,    * @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the projection and transfer operators in the configuration space @xmath71 * @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this enlarged hamiltonian is in the full augmented hilbert space :   @xmath74 . as in the case of the phonon space , in this _ disorder configuration _ space",
    ", a general vector is a pattern of @xmath75 and @xmath76-s .",
    "the sequence of sites where we have a @xmath76 is called the cardinality sequence and uniquely describes the configuration .",
    "a typical member of a basis in this augmented space is @xmath77 .",
    "the augmented space theorem @xcite states that :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the null cardinality sequence or one where we have @xmath75 everywhere .",
    "equivalently , exactly as discussed in section 1 , we can construct the above formalism in reciprocal space by fourier transforming the electronic part of the basis and keeping the rest unchanged .",
    "so we can write the configuration averaged green s function in reciprocal space as :    @xmath80    the operation of the terms in the hamiltonian are mostly identical to ( 7 ) except for the second to fourth terms in equation ( 8) :    @xmath81    here , @xmath82 is a general cardinality sequence @xmath83 .    for obtaining the configuration averaged spectral function we carry out recursion with the starting state @xmath84 using the three term recursion similar to ( 6 ) but in the full augmented space .",
    "as before , from the orthogonality of the recursive states , we obtain the coefficients @xmath85 and averaged green function is obtained as a continued fraction : 0.3 cm @xmath86    as before the calculation is carried down to a finite number n of steps and then the continued fraction is terminated by a function @xmath87 as suggested by beer and pettifor .",
    "the configuration averaged spectral function and other quantities of interest are calculated using the same formalism as discussed in section 1 .",
    "in this section we will discuss the results of our ground - state properties and compare them with the results of two of the most successful recent numerical works .",
    "the figure [ fig1 ] shows the spectral functions for different @xmath88 values .",
    "all the spectral functions show a very narrow delta function like peaks at the lower end of the spectrum .",
    "this is related to the band corresponding to the polaron ground state .",
    "this state has very narrow width , which means this @xmath88-labeled state has a very long lifetime .",
    "the other peaks are related to excited states .",
    "these have larger widths .",
    "the dispersion curves shown in figure [ f.1 ] ( left ) are obtained by fitting lorentzian s in the neighbourhood of the peaks in the spectral function : the lorentzian centre gives the energy @xmath44 while the width gives the width in the dispersion curves .",

    "the results match to within our accuracy window across the parametric regime @xmath89 . at the low electron - phonon coupling regime",
    "we have a quasi - free electron with a slightly renormalized mass .",
    "as the electron - phonon coupling strength increases the polaron becomes heavier .",

    "there is excellent agreement in between our results generated using both of our basis and vaed results which is shown in figure [ f.5 ] . in figure [ f.5](a )",
    "we show the static correlation function for @xmath55=0.1 ( adiabatic ) and @xmath20=0.1(weak coupling ) , and we can clearly see spatial extent of the polaron span the system size , therefore a large polaron .",
    "we do not show the dmrg result in this case as it is less reliable in this parameter regime . in figure[f.5](b )",
    "we show the @xmath91 for @xmath55=1.0 and @xmath20=0.5 , which again matches well with the vaed calculation .",

    "we have achieved excellent convergence applying the modified or phonon - enriched vaed basis ( m - vaed ) , as described in section 1 , using n=17 ( 34 bosons at the root site ) ; n=18 ( 36 phonons at root site ) and n=19 ( 37 phonons at the root site ) shell maps .",
    "our energy converges to 11 - 12 decimal places for these two calculations .",

    "the decrement in @xmath91(1 ) w.r.t to g and the corresponding change in @xmath91(0 ) implies that , from this g onward the lattice distortion starts getting confined to the electron site .",

    "in this section we discuss our calculation for the first excited state of the electron - phonon system . the first excited state consists of the ground state polaron and an unbounded extra phonon excitation@xcite . here",
    "the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state should be equal to @xmath55 for a infinite chain(i.e . , thermodynamic limit ) and the mean phonon number difference should be equal to one(i.e . , @xmath100=1.0 ) .",
    "but for the excited state there are two distinct regimes , one below the critical electron - phonon coupling @xmath101 where the excited phonon tries to be at a infinite distance away from the ground state polaron(but the finite size of the system hinders it)and above it where the excited phonon is absorbed by the ground state polaron forming a bound state .",

    "our calculations shows a phase - transition precisely at @xmath20=0.95 .",
    "our calculated binding energy ( for the first excited state ) and correlation functions clearly answers to the issue , whether the extra phonon excitation forms a bound state with the ground state polaron after a certain point(i , e . , @xmath101 ) or prefers to remain infinitely separated(of course limited by the finite size of the system ) for all values of @xmath20 .",
    "the binding energy @xmath102 - @xmath55(where @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the first - excited - state and ground - state energy respectively ) as a function of electron - phonon coupling @xmath20 is shown in figure[fig4 ] for various system sizes .",
    "below @xmath106 , @xmath107 varies with system size but is greater than zero .",
    "this variation with system size is due to the fact , that the excited phonon want to be infinitely away from the the ground state polaron , but the system size limits its ability .",
    "as the system size increases it slowly approaches the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , @xmath107=0 . for @xmath108 , where the absorption of the excited phonon by the ground - state - polaron has resulted in formation of a bound state ,",

    "the difference in between the ground state @xmath116 and first excited state @xmath116 should be one for a infinite system , but our difference is about 1.02 and this can be attributed to finite size effect@xcite .",

    "the difference in phonon number of the ground state and the excited state is 2.33 again exactly same as vaed@xcite .",
    "thus here the excited bound polaron has many extra phonon excitations compared to the ground state polaron . since the extra phonon excitation are almost confined to the root site of the electron , it throws some light on the fact that at @xmath101 the root site gets detached from the rest of the lattice@xcite .",

    "the bands are well separated . as in the ordered case , the lower band has very little width . in comparison with the ordered case",
