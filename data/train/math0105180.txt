    "we study the following problem from ( real ) enumerative geometry .    given : :    @xmath2 ( not necessarily disjoint ) spheres with centers    @xmath4 and radii @xmath5 ,    @xmath6 .",
    "question : :    in the case of finitely many common tangent lines , what is their    maximum number ?",
    "the number of @xmath2 spheres guarantees that in the generic case there is indeed a finite number of common tangent lines .",
    "in particular , for @xmath7 the answer is  4 since two disjoint circles have 4 common tangents .",
    "the reason for studying this question  which , of course , is an appealing and fundamental geometric question in itself  came from different motivations .",
    "an essential task in statistical analysis is to find the line that best fits the data in the sense of minimizing the maximal distance to the points  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , the decision variant of this problem asks : given @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and a set of points @xmath10 , does there exist a line @xmath11 in @xmath3 such every point @xmath12 has euclidean distance at most @xmath13 from  @xmath11 . from the complexity - theoretical point of view , for fixed dimension the problem can be solved in polynomial time via quantifier elimination over the reals  @xcite . however , currently no practical algorithms focusing on exact computation are known for @xmath14 ( for approximation algorithms , see  @xcite ) .    from the algebraic perspective , for dimension  3",
    "it was shown in  @xcite how to reduce the algorithmic problem to an algebraic - geometric core problem : finding the real lines which all have the same prescribed distance from 4  given points ; or , equivalently , finding the real common tangent lines to 4  given unit spheres in @xmath15 .",
    "this problem in dimension 3 was treated in  @xcite .",
    "[ prop : mpth ] four unit spheres in @xmath15 have at most @xmath16 common tangent lines unless their centers are collinear .",
    "furthermore , there exists a configuration with @xmath16 different real tangent lines .    the same reduction idea to the algebraic - geometric core problem also applies to arbitrary dimensions , in this case leading to the general problem stated at the beginning .    from the purely algebraic - geometric point of view , this tangent problem is interesting for the following reason . in dimension  3 ,",
    "the formulation of the problem in terms of plcker coordinates gives 5 quadratic equations in projective space @xmath17 , whose common zeroes in @xmath18 include a 1-dimensional component at infinity ( accounting for the `` missing '' @xmath19 solutions )",
    ". quite remarkably , as observed in @xcite , this excess component can not be resolved by a single blow - up .",
    "experimental results in  @xcite for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , indicate that for higher dimensions the generic number of solutions differs from the bzout number of the straightforward polynomial formulation even more .",
    "we discuss this further in section  5 .",
    "our main result can be stated as follows .",
    "[ th : ndimnumber ] suppose @xmath22 .    1 .",
    "let @xmath23 affinely span @xmath24 , and let @xmath25 .",
    "if the @xmath2 spheres with centers @xmath26 and radii @xmath5 have only a finite number of complex common tangent lines , then that number is bounded by @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   there exists a configuration with @xmath1 different real common tangent lines .",
    "moreover , this configuration can be achieved with unit spheres .",
    "thus the bound for real common tangents equals the ( _ a priori greater _ ) bound for complex common tangents ; so this problem of common tangents to spheres is fully real in the sense of enumerative real algebraic geometry  @xcite .",
    "we prove statement ( a ) in section 2 and statement ( b ) in section 3 , where we explicitly describe configurations with @xmath1 common real tangents .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a configuration of 4 spheres in @xmath27 with 12 common tangents ( as given in  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath28    in section  4 , we show that there are configurations of spheres with affinely dependent centers having @xmath1 _ complex _ common tangents ; thus , the upper bound of theorem  [ th : ndimnumber ] also holds for spheres in this special position .",
    "megyesi  @xcite has recently shown that all @xmath1 may be real .",
    "we also show that if the centers of the spheres are the vertices of the crosspolytope in @xmath29 , there will be at most @xmath30 common tangents , and if the spheres overlap but do not contain the centroid of the crosspolytope , then all @xmath30 common tangents will be real .",
    "we conjecture that when the centers are affinely dependent and all spheres have the same radius , then there will be at most @xmath30 real common tangents .",
    "strong evidence for this conjecture is provided by megyesi  @xcite , who showed that there are at most 8 real common tangents to 4 unit spheres in @xmath27 whose centers are coplanar but not collinear .    in section 5",
    ", we put the tangent problem into the perspective of common tangents to general quadric hypersurfaces .",
    "in particular , we discuss the problem of common tangents to @xmath2 smooth quadrics in _ projective _ @xmath31-space , and describe the excess component at infinity for this problem of spheres . in this",
    "setting , theorem  [ th : ndimnumber](a ) implies that there will be at most @xmath1 isolated common tangents to @xmath2 quadrics in projective @xmath31-space , when the quadrics all contain the same ( smooth ) quadric in a given hyperplane .",
    "in particular , the problem of the spheres can be seen as the case when the common quadric is at infinity and contains no real points .",
    "we conclude with the question of how many of these common tangents may be real when the shared quadric has real points . for @xmath32 , there are 5 cases to consider , and for each , all 12 lines can be real  @xcite .",
    "megyesi  @xcite has recently shown that all common tangents may be real , for many cases of the shared quadric .",
    "for @xmath33 , let @xmath34 denote their euclidean dot product .",
    "we write @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "we represent a line in @xmath37 by a point @xmath38 lying on the line and a direction vector @xmath39 of that line .",
    "( for notational convenience we typically work with a representative of the direction vector in @xmath40 . ) if @xmath41 we can make @xmath42 unique by requiring that @xmath43 .    by definition , a line @xmath44 is tangent to the sphere with center @xmath45 and radius @xmath13 if and only if it is tangent to the quadratic hypersurface @xmath46 , i.e. , if and only if the quadratic equation @xmath47 has a solution of multiplicity two .",
    "when @xmath48 is real then this is equivalent to the metric property that @xmath48 has euclidean distance @xmath13 from @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 for any line @xmath51 , the algebraic tangent condition on @xmath48 gives the equation @xmath52",

    "then the remaining centers span @xmath24 . subtracting the equation for the sphere centered at the origin from the equations for the spheres @xmath56",
    "gives the system @xmath57 ^ 2         - { { v}}^2 ( r_i^2 - r^2 ) \\",

    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    note that this system of equations does not have a solution with @xmath58 .",
    "namely , if we had @xmath58 , then @xmath59 for all @xmath60 . since the centers span @xmath24 , this would imply @xmath61 , contradicting @xmath62 .",
    "this validates our assumption that @xmath63 prior to  ( [ eq : tansphere ] ) .    since @xmath0 , the bottom line of  ( [ eq : origintransform ] ) contains at least @xmath31 equations .",
    "we can assume @xmath64 are linearly independent .",
    "then the matrix @xmath65 is invertible , and we can solve the equations with indices @xmath66 for  @xmath42 : @xmath67 ^ 2 -{{v}}^2(r_1 ^ 2-r^2)\\\\        \\vdots \\\\",
    "{ { v}}^2 { { c}}_n^2 - [ { { v}}\\cdot { { c}}_n]^2-{{v}}^2(r_n^2-r^2)\\rule{0pt}{12.5pt }      \\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ] now substitute this expression for @xmath42 into the first and second equation of the system  ( [ eq : origintransform ] ) , as well as into the equations for @xmath68 , and then clear the denominators .",
    "this gives @xmath69 homogeneous equations in the coordinate @xmath70 , namely one cubic , one quartic , and @xmath71 quadrics . by bzout s theorem ,",
    "this means that if the system has only finitely many solutions , then the number of solutions is bounded by @xmath72 , for @xmath0 . for small values of @xmath31 ,",
    "these values are shown in table  @xmath73 .",
    "the value 12 for @xmath32 was computed in  @xcite , and the values for @xmath74 were computed experimentally in  @xcite .        the bound of 32 tangent lines to 4 quadrics in @xmath75 is sharp , even under the restriction to real quadrics and real tangents @xcite . in a computer calculation , we found 320 lines in @xmath76 tangent to 6 general quadrics ; thus , the upper bound of theorem  [ thm : bezout ] is sharp also for @xmath77 , and indicating that it is likely sharp for @xmath78 .",
    "the question arises : what is the source of the huge discrepancy between the second and third rows of table  [ ta : quadvalues ] ?",
    "consider a sphere in affine @xmath31-space @xmath79 homogenizing this with respect to the new variable @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath81 if we restrict this sphere to the hyperplane at infinity , setting @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83 the equation for an imaginary quadric at infinity .",
    "we invite the reader to check that every line at infinity tangent to this quadric is tangent to the original sphere .",
    "thus the equations for lines in @xmath84 tangent to @xmath2 spheres define the @xmath85 lines we computed in theorem  [ th : ndimnumber ] , as well as this excess component of lines at infinity tangent to the imaginary quadric  ( [ eq : imaginary ] ) .",
    "thus , this excess component contributes some portion of the bzout number of theorem  [ thm : bezout ] to the total number of lines .",
    "indeed , when @xmath32 , aluffi and fulton  @xcite have given a careful argument that this excess component contributes 20 , which implies that there are @xmath86 isolated common tangent lines to 4 spheres in 3-space , recovering the result of  @xcite .",
    "the geometry of that calculation is quite interesting . given a system of equations on a space ( say the grassmannian ) whose set of zeroes has a positive - dimensional excess component , one method to compute the number of isolated solutions is to first modify the underlying space by blowing up the excess component and then compute the number of solutions on this new space .",
    "in many cases , the equations on this new space have only isolated solutions . however , for this problem of lines tangent to spheres , the equations on the blown up space will _ still _ have an excess intersection and a further blow - up is required .",
    "this problem of lines tangent to 4 spheres in projective 3-space is by far the simplest enumerative geometric problem with an excess component of zeroes which requires two blow - ups ( technically speaking , blow - ups along smooth centers ) to resolve the excess zeroes .",
    "[ thm : ub ] given @xmath2 quadrics in @xmath84 whose intersection with a fixed hyperplane is a given smooth quadric @xmath87 , but are otherwise general , there will be at most @xmath85 isolated lines in @xmath84 tangent to each quadric .",
    "when the quadrics are all real , we ask : how many of these @xmath85 common isolated tangents can be real ?",
    "this question is only partially answered by theorem  [ th : ndimnumber ] .",
    "the point is that projective real quadrics are classified up to real projective transformations by the absolute value of the signature of the quadratic forms on @xmath88 defining them .",
    "theorem  [ th : ndimnumber ] implies that all lines can be real when the shared quadric @xmath87 has no real points ( signature is @xmath89 ) . in  @xcite",
    ", it is shown that when @xmath32 , each of the five additional cases concerning nonempty quadrics can have all 12 lines real .",
    "recently , megyesi  @xcite has largely answered this question .",
    "specifically , he showed that , for any nonzero real numbers @xmath90 , there are @xmath2 quadrics of the form @xmath91 having all @xmath85 tangents real .",
    "these all share the same quadric at infinity @xmath92 and thus the upper bound of theorem  [ thm : ub ] is attained , when the shared quadric is this quadric .",
