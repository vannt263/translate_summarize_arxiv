    "the x - ray continuum in seyfert galaxies has been well studied ; in these objects , a hard spectral component dominates the emission above @xmath5  2  kev .",
    "a proposed origin for this component is in a hot corona above the accretion disc surface , in which optical / uv photons from the disc are comptonized to x - ray energies .",
    "a fraction of the hard x - ray power - law continuum then illuminates the disc ( and possibly a molecular torus ) ; some of these photons are absorbed , forming an iron k - edge at @xmath6  7  kev , while others are reprocessed into an fe k@xmath7 line at 6.4  kev and a compton reflection ` hump ' , caused by compton down - scattering of the hard x - ray photons ( pounds 1990 ) .",
    "it has been found that , although these features are generally observed in seyfert 1 galaxies ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) , they are less common in the spectra of qsos ( e.g. , reeves 1997 ; lawson & turner 1997 ) . in many cases",
    "this could be related to a lack of signal to noise , but it is important to determine whether such features are ubiquitous in qsos and , hence , whether this emission mechanism is common over the full range of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) luminosities . observing the most luminous qsos allows an investigation into objects where the accretion rate may be close to the eddington limit and/or where the black hole mass may be large ( i.e. , @xmath5  10@xmath8  @xmath9 ) .",
    "work with _ asca _",
    "( e.g. , reeves & turner 2000 ) found evidence for iron - line emission in a number of qsos , but often originating from ionized material , rather than the cold emission found for seyferts .",
    "if this were true in general , it could be explained by the more luminous agn having a higher accretion rate , which causes the surface of the disc to become ionized .",
    "the qsos in this paper form a small sample of high - luminosity , radio - quiet objects , with x - ray luminosities from 7  @xmath1  10@xmath10 to 3  @xmath1  10@xmath11 erg  s@xmath4 ( bolometric luminosities of 7  @xmath1  10@xmath2 to 2  @xmath1  10@xmath3 erg  s@xmath4 ) ; the redshifts cover a range from 0.244 up to 2.038 .",
    "radio - quiet objects form the majority of luminous agn ( e.g. , kukula 1998 ) , but are less x - ray luminous than their radio - loud counterparts , for a given optical luminosity ( zamorani 1981 ; worrall 1987 ; wilkes 1994 ) . because radio - quiet qsos ( rqqs ) are fainter in the x - ray band , the high through - put of the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray telescopes makes the epic instruments ideal for an x - ray investigation of distant rqqs .",
    "the aim of this study is to investigate the properties of the central engine in some of the most luminous qsos ( i.e. , the extreme end of the accretion rate , black hole mass and/or luminosity parameter space ) .",
    "it is possible to do this with rqqs since the jet is thought not to contribute significantly to the x - ray emission , whereas , in radio - loud quasars , synchrotron or inverse compton emission from a relativistic jet may dilute some of the spectral features ( such as the iron line or soft excess ) which are thought to originate from the accretion disc .",
    "table  [ xmm ] lists the dates and the instrumental set - up for each of the epic observations , while table  [ objects ] gives the redshifts , galactic absorbing column and radio measurements for each of the qsos . a value of r@xmath12  @xmath13  1 defines the agn as being radio - quiet , where r@xmath12 is given by the log of the ratio of the radio ( 5  ghz ) to optical ( _ b_-band ) fluxes ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; kellerman 1989 ) .",
    "the pipeline - produced event - lists were filtered using xmmselect within version 5.4 of the sas ( science analysis software ) ; single- and double - pixel events ( patterns 04 ) were used for the pn , while patterns 012 were chosen for the mos instruments .",
    "spectra were extracted within a small circular region , centred on the source , with a radius of between 25 and 40 arcsec , depending on the source brightness .",
    "( smaller regions were used for the fainter sources , to minimise the contribution from the background . )",
    "background spectra ( within the same size , or larger , region ) were produced from an off - set position free of other sources .",
    "mos 1 and mos 2 spectra were subsequently co - added , after confirmation that the results were consistent .",
    "source and background light - curves were also extracted for each object .",
    "time intervals of relatively high , flaring background were identified for both of the pg qsos , and these periods were excluded from the following analysis .",
    "none of the source light - curves showed variability over the duration of the observations after the removal of the background , however .",
    "after grouping the spectra to obtain a minimum of 20 counts per bin , version 11.1.0 of xspec was used to analyse the data .",
    "the most recent ( time - dependent ) response matrices ( rmfs ) were used when fitting the spectra , together with an ancillary response file ( arf ) generated by running arfgen within the sas .",
    "the rmfs take into account the degradation of the instruments over the years since launch , and specifically model how the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) has changed .",
    "optical / uv magnitudes were obtained from the optical monitor where possible and these are discussed in section  [ sec : om ] .",
    "errors are given at the 90  per  cent level ( e.g. , @xmath14  =  4.6 for 2 interesting parameters ) . throughout this paper , a wmap cosmology of h@xmath15  =  70  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , cosmological constant @xmath16  =  0.73 and @xmath17  =  1-@xmath16 is assumed ; for comparison with previous conventions , using q@xmath15  =  0.1 and h@xmath15  =  70  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 would give slightly smaller luminosity distances : a factor of @xmath50.930.97 ( z  =  0.2242.038 ) compared to the values used here .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     seds ( spectral energy distributions ) were produced , showing the comptonization fit over the _ xmm - newton _ band , together with the om optical / uv points , and are plotted in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "there is an added complication for the objects at higher redshift , however . for pg  1634 + 706 ,",
    "sbs  0909 + 532 and pg  1247 + 267 , some of the optical monitor data points are very close to the lyman limit of 912   ; a vertical dotted line indicates 912    in figure  [ sed ] . without applying a correction factor , the optical / uv data points",
    "would be seen to fall with increasing frequency , since some of the higher - frequency photons have been absorbed .",
    "barvainis ( 1990 ) plots an sed for pg  1634 + 706 at frequencies lower than @xmath5  2  @xmath1  10@xmath18  hz , where the spectrum can be seen to be rising as the frequency increases .",
    "similarly , koratkar , kinney & bohlin ( 1992 ) show a uv spectrum of pg  1247 + 267 , where absorption below @xmath5  2000    can clearly be seen .",
    "the measurements which fall between ly@xmath7 ( 1216   ) and ly@xmath19 ( 1026   ) , or between ly@xmath19 and the limit of the series , have been corrected by the mean values for the lyman line absorption given by obrien , gondhalekar & wilson ( 1988 ) . beyond the lyman limit , absorption by the continuum",
    "is also important .",
    "this correction factor is , however , uncertain , so the two highest frequency uv points in pg  1247 + 267 have only been corrected for the line absorption , not the additional continuum absorption ; therefore , the uv spectrum in this case is reddened .",
    "in this paper , optical to x - ray seds have been investigated for high luminosity , radio - quiet qsos , ranging from @xmath5  7  @xmath1  10@xmath10 to 3  @xmath1  10@xmath11 erg s@xmath4 over the x - ray band ( 7  @xmath1  10@xmath2  2  @xmath1  10@xmath3erg s@xmath4 bolometric ) .    when fitting the rest - frame 210  kev band , the mean photon index for the five qsos in this sample is @xmath20  =  1.93  @xmath21  0.02 . despite the sample being small , this value is in very good agreement with the slopes measured in _ asca",
    "_ spectra by reeves & turner ( 2000 ) , for which a mean slope of 1.89  @xmath21  0.05 was found for the radio - quiet qsos , and also with _ ginga",
    "_ results ( lawson & turner 1997 ) .",
    "similarly , page ( 2003a ) also obtained an average value of 1.89  @xmath21  0.04 , for a sample of lower luminosity serendipitous _ xmm - newton_-detected qsos .",
    "this value of @xmath20  @xmath5  1.9 is the same as that found for seyfert 1 galaxies by nandra & pounds ( 1994 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath22 for this sample was found to be @xmath01.48 .",
    "this is somewhat flatter than other surveys of qsos have found ( e.g. , 1.66 ",
    "page 2003a ; 1.561.78 , vignali 2001 ) , but the result is not surprising , since the five objects in this sample were selected from luminous agn in the _ rosat _ all sky survey and are , therefore , x - ray bright . @xmath22 has been previously found to become steeper with increased luminosity ( e.g. , wilkes 1994 ; vignali , brandt & schneider 2003 ) . this small sample confirms these results , with a simple spearman rank correlations giving a probability of 98  per  cent .",
    "the vast majority of luminous agn ( turner & pounds 1989 ; pounds & reeves 2002 ) show soft excesses  that is , emission above the extrapolation of a power - law , fitted to the 210 kev ( rest frame ) energy band , at energies @xmath23  1  kev .",
    "four of the qsos in this sample show soft excess emission very clearly ; the evidence is only marginal for pg  1247 + 267 , where the reflection component provides the observed curvature in the spectrum at higher energies . it should be noted that , at higher redshifts , cool soft excesses will become more difficult to detect , due to the shift in the rest - frame energy - band to higher values .",
    "pg  1247 + 267 shows a weak indication for a blackbody component of kt  @xmath5  50  ev , which , at z  =  2.038 , is mainly shifted out of the bandpass of _ xmm - newton_. alternatively , if the spectrum is modelled without a reflection parameter , then pg  1247 + 267 shows a very hot soft excess ( highest blackbody kt of @xmath5  0.7  kev ) ; this lack of reflection is not consistent with the strong iron line , though , unless the reprocessing material is compton - thin ..    thus , it appears that high - luminosity radio - quiet agn have identical x - ray continuum properties to lower - luminosity qsos and seyfert 1 galaxies . the objects in this sample cover a range of x - ray luminosities between @xmath5  7  @xmath1  10@xmath10 and 3  @xmath1  10@xmath11 erg  s@xmath4 , whereas seyfert galaxies typically cover a range of @xmath5  10@xmath2410@xmath10 erg  s@xmath4 ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "this indicates that the agn x - ray continuum shape remains essentially constant over a wide range of black hole mass and luminosity .",
    "two components are required to model the broad - band x - ray continuum .",
    "these can be explained through comptonization of photons from the accretion disc : the hard x - ray power - law is produced through an interaction with hot ( possibly non - thermal ) electrons in a corona above the accretion disc . a second , cooler population of electrons ( @xmath5  0.5  kev , rather than @xmath6  100  kev ) produces the soft excess ; these electrons are still much hotter than the accretion disc itself , though , which has a temperature of kt  @xmath23  30  ev .",
    "it is not yet clear how the soft excess electrons are heated .",
    "one possibility is that some areas of the accretion disc are irradiated by the hot electron corona ; this could lead to ` hot - spots ' on the accretion disc , where a warm , mildly ionized layer could comptonize the thermal optical / uv photons to the soft excess temperatures ( e.g. , di salvo 2001 ) . alternatively , the regions of the disc heated by the flares could thermalise the radiation , forming a blackbody spectrum with a temperature higher than that of the mean disc emission ( haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "the size of this soft - excess - forming ` region ' can be estimated by assuming that the emission is blackbody in nature ( since @xmath25  @xmath26  1 , this is a valid approximation ) ; taking the emitting region to be circular , and performing this calculation , leads to a radius of @xmath510@xmath2710@xmath28  m. for a black hole of mass 10@xmath8  @xmath9 , the schwarzschild radius is @xmath5  3  @xmath1  10@xmath28  m ",
    "i.e. , the emitting region is actually smaller than r@xmath29 this implies that the warmer region is patchy , rather than covering the entire surface of the disc ; likewise , the hot , flaring ( coronal ) regions must also be small .",
    "this result is also consistent with some of the disc photons being observed directly as the optical / uv emission , while yet more interact with the hot electron corona to form the observed power - law .",
    "iron lines were commonly identified in agn spectra by _ ginga _ observations ( pounds 1989 ; pounds 1990 ; nandra 1991 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) . with the improved resolution of current instruments ,",
    "it is sometimes possible to differentiate between narrow ( @xmath1310  ev ; unresolved by an instrument such as _ xmm - newton _ ) and broad lines .",
    "to date , few broad lines have been found in _ xmm - newton _ spectra of agn , examples being q  0056@xmath0363 ( porquet & reeves 2003 ) , mcg@xmath05@xmath023@xmath016 ( dewangan , griffiths & schurch 2003 ) , mcg@xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 ( fabian 2002b ) , mrk  205 ( reeves 2001 ) and mrk  509 ( pounds 2001 ) .",
    "nandra ( 1997 ) reported a baldwin effect for the broad lines in _ asca _ data  that is , as the x - ray luminosity of the source increases , the strength of the broad line diminishes .",
    "the same baldwin effect has been identified for the narrow iron lines in _ xmm - newton _ observations ( page 2004 ) . also , both reeves ( 1997 ) and lawson & turner ( 1997 ) found that reprocessed features ( such as the iron k@xmath7 line and reflection humps ) were less common in qsos than in the lower - luminosity seyferts .",
    "thus , it is rather surprising to find a strong , apparently broad line , together with a clear reflection component , in such a luminous qso as pg  1247 + 267 ( broad - band x - ray luminosity of @xmath5  2  @xmath1  10@xmath11 erg  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "both the strength and velocity width of the line ( @xmath30  =  30  000 km  s@xmath4 ) imply that the reflection is occuring off the inner accretion disc , rather than distant matter , such as the torus .",
    "the line is also much stronger than the narrow component of the fe lines observed from further out ( that is , from the broad or narrow line regions , or the torus ) in many seyfert 1s ; these narrow lines are typically around 100  ev in equivalent width ( e.g. , page 2004 ; kaspi 2001 ; pounds 2001 ; reeves 2001 ) .",
    "q  0144@xmath03938 was also better fitted with a broad , rather than a narrow line , but is less luminous than pg  1247 + 267 ; it was not possible to determine whether the line in the spectrum of sbs  0909 + 267 was broad or narrow .",
    "3c  273 , a lumious radio - loud quasar , has previously been reported to show evidence for a broad line ( yaqoob & serlemitsos 2000 ; page 2004b ) , though much weaker than in pg  1247 + 267 , with an ew of @xmath5  50  ev .",
    "pg  1247 + 267 seems to be the most luminous qso to show a strong ( apparently ) broad line to date , although there is some uncertainty about whether the line is truly broad ; the object also reveals the first clear detection of a reflection component in a high - luminosity agn .",
    "reeves & turner ( 2000 ) found , in a sample of 62 qsos ( both radio - loud and -quiet ) , that approximately half of the iron emission lines seen were at energies @xmath66.4  kev , implying the lines originated from partially ionized matter .",
    "it seems somewhat unusual that the lines reported in this paper appear neutral ; however , the current sample of five ( three detections ) is much smaller than in the reeves & turner ( 2000 ) paper .",
    "it should be noted that the reflection component found in pg  1247 + 267 is very strong , even for an accretion disc : r  @xmath6  2 implies the reflection is occuring from @xmath6  4@xmath31 steradian .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for this .",
    "it could be a geometrical phenomenon ; i.e. , part of the direct , hard x - ray emission may be being obscured by structure within the disc . in this case , the reflection would appear enhanced ( see , e.g. , fabian 2002a ) .",
    "alternatively , it could be due to relativistic effects .",
    "fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) use gravitational light - bending as an argument for explaining the very strong line ( also @xmath5  400 - 500  ev ) observed in mcg  @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 .    with the discovery of such a strong iron line and reflection component in pg  1247 + 267 , a much longer observation of the object ( @xmath619  ks of pn time as presented here ) is desirable , in order to investigate the spectral features more thoroughly , including whether the line varies over time .",
    "the work in this paper is based on observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission , with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa and nasa .",
    "the authors would like to thank the epic consortium for all their work during the calibration phase , and the soc and ssc teams for making the observation and analysis possible .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administation .",

    "<S> spectral energy distributions were calculated from the _ xmm - newton _ epic ( european photon imaging camera ) and om ( optical monitor ) data , with bolometric luminosities estimated in the range from 7  @xmath1  10@xmath2 to 2  @xmath1  10@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 for the sample , peaking in the uv . </S>",
    "<S> at least four of the qsos show a similar soft excess , which can be well modelled by either one or two blackbody components , in addition to the hard x - ray power - law . </S>",
    "<S> the temperatures of these blackbodies ( @xmath5  100500  ev ) are too high to be direct thermal emission from the accretion disc , so comptonization is suggested . </S>",
    "<S> two populations of comptonizing electrons , with different temperatures , are needed to model the broad - band spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the hotter of these produces what is seen as the hard x - ray power - law , while the cooler ( @xmath5  0.250.5  kev ) population models the spectral curvature at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> only one of the qsos shows evidence for an absorption component , while three of the five show neutral iron emission . of these , pg  1247 + 267 seems to have a broad line ( ew  @xmath5  250  ev ) , with a strong , associated reflection component ( r  @xmath5  2 ) , measured out to 30  kev in the rest frame of the qso . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is concluded that the x - ray continuum shape of agn remains essentially constant over a wide range of black hole mass and luminosity .    </S>",
