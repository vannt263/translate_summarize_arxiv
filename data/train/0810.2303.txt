    "large - scale regular magnetic fields have been detected by faraday rotation of radiation of polarized background sources in the milky way @xcite , and the nearest galaxies @xcite , such as m31 @xcite , and the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "the limiting factor for this work is the number density of bright polarized background sources .",
    "a few galaxies in the local group ( m31 , lmc ) have angular sizes large enough to probe their magnetic field structure by rotation measures of polarized background sources with current radio telescopes .",
    "magnetic fields in galaxies outside the local group have been studied mainly with imaging polarimetry at radio wavelengths ( beck 2005 for a review ) .",
    "these observations indicate a large - scale azimuthal magnetic field in the plane of the disk of spiral galaxies , normally oriented in a spiral pattern with a pitch angle similar to the optical spiral arms .",
    "high degrees of polarization have been observed in inter - arm regions of some galaxies , such as ngc  6946 @xcite .",
    "if a magnetic field is observed in a barred galaxy , it is aligned with the bar inside the region of the bar , with a spiral pattern outside the bar region @xcite .",
    "however , some barred galaxies show no detectable polarized emission or polarized emission along the bar .    statistical information on magnetic fields in galaxies is required to study the cosmic evolution of these magnetic fields by observing galaxies over a range of redshift .",
    "polarimetric imaging of a large sample of spiral galaxies in the local universe is impractical with current instrumentation because of the high sensitivity and angular resolution required . on the other hand , deep polarization surveys of the sky",
    "are underway or being planned that will have the sensitivity to detect spiral galaxies out to large distances , but not resolve these galaxies .",
    "the first deep wide - area polarimetry survey with the sensitivity to detect spiral galaxies is galfacts at 1.4 ghz , 5@xmath5 point source sensitivity of 400@xmath6jy , and resolution @xmath7 .",
    "ska pathfinder telescopes such as askap @xcite aim to do all - sky polarimetry surveys at 1.4 ghz with an instantaneous band width of 300 mhz with thousands of spectral channels and a @xmath8 point source sensitivity around @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "askap will be able to detect a few thousand spiral galaxies at sufficient signal to noise ratio to detect polarization at the few percent level , but the expected angular resolution of @xmath10 to @xmath11 will not resolve these galaxies . this raises the question what can be learned about magnetic fields from polarimetry of large samples of unresolved spiral galaxies .",
    "observations of polarization from spiral galaxies at redshifts up to 1 or higher will require the square kilometre array ( ska ) , and even then it will be difficult to make resolved polarization maps of these high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetism is one of five key science drivers for the ska @xcite . for the evolution of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies as a function of redshift , polarization of the integrated emission",
    "is most readily observable , and a comparison with unresolved galaxies at low redshift is relatively straightforward .",
    "the number density of faint polarized radio sources in the sky determines the unknown confusion limit in polarization , and is an important parameter for rotation measure studies .",
    "below 1 mjy total flux density , star forming galaxies become an increasingly important fraction of all radio sources .",
    "knowledge of the polarization properties of these galaxies is required to make realistic predictions of the number of polarized sources at @xmath12 levels in polarized flux density .",
    "spiral galaxies may become an important fraction of the polarized 1.4 ghz radio source population at @xmath6jy flux densities @xcite .",
    "this paper presents observations and models that show that unresolved spiral galaxies have detectable polarized emission , sometimes more than 10% polarized at 4.8 ghz , and that statistical information on magnetic fields and internal faraday rotation can be derived from integrated polarization measurements of spiral galaxies .",

    "one nearby galaxy ( ngc  4631 , classified as sb ) was included in table  [ barred - tab ] .",
    "the nearest galaxies in the sample and the galaxies in the virgo cluster were observed with the 100m - effelsberg telescope , sometimes in combination with the vla .",
    "these galaxies are not affected by missing short spacings in the interferometer .",
    "the barred galaxies were not observed with the effelsberg telescope , and the images could in principle lack large scale structure resolved by the shortest baselines of the interferometer . a comparison of 6 cm flux densities derived by @xcite with published integrated flux densities showed that ngc  1313 and ngc  3992 in table  [ barred - tab ] may be affected by missing short spacings , because published flux densities listed in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) are substantially higher than the 6-cm flux density in @xcite . if no 6 cm flux density was published , we compared the 21 cm flux density corrected for a spectral index 0.7 - 1 with the flux density in @xcite .",

    "their axial ratio was defined by the outer isophotes in the stokes @xmath18 image and the ellipses include the entire galaxy up to the noise level of the stokes i map .",

    "the correction for polarization bias did not have a measurable effect for most galaxies because of the high signal to noise ratio of the integrated flux densities .",
    "the integrated fractional polarization of each galaxy was calculated as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total flux density , including thermal and non - thermal emission . the polarization angle @xmath25 of the integrated emission is expected to be aligned with the apparent minor axis of the optical galaxy .",
    "the sensitivity of the observations is included in the errors for @xmath26 through the noise in the maps .",
    "the error estimates also include the uncertainty in the zero level , that dominates the uncertainty for galaxies with a large angular size such as m  31 .",

    "the integrated polarized flux densities are not affected by significant residual instrumental polarization .",
    "small values for the integrated fractional polarization are the result of integrating significant flux in stokes q and u , with nearly equal positive and negative contributions .",

    "five of the virgo galaxies have additional observations at 8.4 ghz .",
    "the fractional polarization at both frequencies agrees to within a few percent for these galaxies .",
    "small differences can be attributed to statistical errors , mainly at 8.4 ghz where the signal to noise ratio of the emission is lower .",
    "the differences in @xmath26 at 4.8 ghz and at 8.4 ghz per galaxy are much smaller than the differences between galaxies .",
    "this confirms that the variation in @xmath26 between galaxies represents intrinsic differences between the galaxies .",
    "the polarization angles at 4.8 ghz and 8.4 ghz are also mutually consistent . in low - inclination galaxies , the polarization angle of the integrated emission",
    "is more affected by asymmetries because the effect of an axially symmetric component on the polarization vanishes mostly .",
    "this can explain the difference in polarization angle for ngc  4303 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the position angle of the major axis can also be affected by ellipticity of the disk .",
    "the fractional polarization of any particular galaxy depends on the direction from which the galaxy is observed , as the projection of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky and the path length of the line of sight through the disk change .",
    "any particular galaxy can only be observed from one direction , but the variation of integrated polarization properties with inclination can be revealed for a sufficiently large sample of galaxies .",
    "the wide range in inclination ( @xmath34 ) in the sample allows an effective analysis of the integrated polarization properties of spiral galaxies as a function of inclination .",
    "it should be noted that the sample is not randomly distributed in inclination .",
    "the galaxies in tables  [ nearby - tab ] , [ virgo - tab ] , and [ barred - tab ] were observed to study their magnetic field configuration through imaging polarimetry .",
    "the sample is biased towards low inclination ( face - on ) and high - inclination ( edge - on ) galaxies because these were preferred for imaging of the magnetic field .",
    "in particular , the sub sample of barred spirals in table  [ barred - tab ] contains only galaxies with inclination @xmath35 , with the exception of the added nearby galaxy ngc  4631 .",
    "any sample of spiral galaxies with inclination derived from the apparent axial ratio appears deficient in galaxies with @xmath36 because the disks of most spiral galaxies are not exactly circular @xcite .",
    "this effect is also apparent in the present sample , but it does not affect our analysis .",

    "the curves in figure  [ diskpol_model - fig ] represent models that will be discussed in section  [ model - sec ] .",
    "the formal errors on @xmath26 are generally small because of the high signal to noise ratio in the integrated flux densities .",
    "some galaxies with large angular size have larger errors because of uncertainties in the zero level of the maps . the large spread in @xmath26 , @xmath37 , seen for each subsample",

    "figure  [ pa - fig]a shows the correlation between the position angle of the major axis , @xmath29 , and @xmath40 for galaxies in table  [ nearby - tab ] and table  [ virgo - tab ] . if polarization of the integrated emission is the result of projection of the azimuthal magnetic field in the disk on the plane of the sky , a correlation is expected between @xmath40 and the line of nodes of the disk intersecting the plane of the sky .",
    "the latter is determined by the position angle of the major axis , @xmath40 .",
    "the most deviating galaxies in figure  [ pa - fig]a are ngc  6946 and ngc  4254 , with inclination @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "large - scale departures from axial symmetry are most likely to be noticed for galaxies with a small inclination .",
    "the position angles used in figure  [ pa - fig ] are also less well defined . at lower inclinations ,",
    "the position angle of the major axis is more difficult to measure because the isophotes are nearly circular . besides measurement uncertainties ,",
    "the position angle of the major axis is not a good estimator for the position angle of the line of nodes of the disk if the inclination approaches @xmath43 , the inclination for which a circular disk would have an apparent axial ratio of 0.9 , similar to the mean intrinsic ellipticity of spiral galaxy disks found by @xcite .",
    "consequently , the uncertainty associated @xmath29 is substantial but hard to quantify for galaxies with inclination less than @xmath44 . for galaxies with higher inclinations , @xmath29",
    "is estimated to be accurate to within @xmath45 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath40 is typically a few degrees , but some additional scatter is expected because of differences in structure between galaxies .",

    "the scatter between @xmath29 and @xmath40 appears substantially larger than in figure  [ pa - fig]a .",
    "this may be a result of magnetic fields aligned with the bar , where the orientation of the bar adds a parameter to the problem . in this paper",
    "we focus mainly on galaxies without ( strong ) bars , while noting that unresolved barred galaxies can in fact also be polarized radio sources .    figure  [ pi_l - fig ] shows the integrated fractional polarization @xmath26 as a function of distance , and monochromatic luminosity @xmath48 .",

    "as shown in figure  [ diskpol_model - fig ] , a galaxy can have low @xmath26 because of strong faraday depolarization , or because of its inclination .",
    "there is no correlation between inclination and luminosity in the sample .",
    "the lower integrated polarization of luminous galaxies in figure  [ pi_l - fig]b suggests stronger faraday depolarization in these galaxies , or a lower degree of uniformity of the magnetic field as will be discussed in section  [ discussion1 ] .",
    "the principal cause of net polarization of unresolved spiral galaxies is the regular azimuthal magnetic field in the disk projected on the sky along the apparent major axis .",
    "faraday rotation and depolarization are affected by the path length through the disk , the line - of - sight component of the regular magnetic field , and fluctuations in thermal electron density and magnetic field strength .",
    "a first analysis of the integrated polarization of spiral galaxies is best served with the simplest possible model that includes these factors .",
    "we consider axially symmetric models with a regular azimuthal magnetic field in the disk , and an isotropic random component of the magnetic field .    using this simple geometry , the integrated polarization of a spiral galaxy is modeled by considering each solid angle element of the disk as a slab with a specified line - of - sight component of the regular magnetic field that depends on inclination and location in the disk .",
    "@xcite provided solutions of polarized intensity from a slab of faraday - rotating medium mixed with relativistic electrons that produce synchrotron emission .",
    "the polarized intensity is expressed as a complex quantity @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are stokes parameters that describe the linear polarization . following the conventions adopted by @xcite , @xmath54 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are normalized by the total intensity of the synchrotron radiation , so that the modulus of @xmath54 is the fractional polarization .",
    "the polarization angle of the complex polarization is @xmath55 .    at higher frequencies , a contribution from thermal emission to the total intensity reduces the observed fractional polarization by a factor ( @xmath56 ) , where @xmath57 is the fraction of the total intensity generated by thermal emission .",
    "we include thermal emission by setting @xmath58 at 4.8 ghz @xcite .",
    "determination of @xmath57 in individual galaxies is difficult because of the need to separate thermal and non - thermal emission in the radio spectrum .",
    "the rms scatter in @xmath57 from galaxy to galaxy is believed to be at most a factor of 2 @xcite .",

    "the important implication is that the plane of polarization of a spiral galaxy that is unresolved by a radio telescope , is independent of wavelength .",
    "the orientation of the plane of polarization can be determined from the position angle of the optical major axis , although with a @xmath161 ambiguity .",
    "as the plane of polarization does not depend on wavelength , we find the surprising result that _ unresolved spiral galaxies behave as idealized polarized background sources without apparent internal faraday rotation . _",
    "this result follows from axial symmetry .",
    "the 8.4 ghz polarization data in table  [ virgo - tab ] seem to confirm that the polarization angle of the integrated emission is independent of wavelength .",
    "more observations are required to confirm this mainly theoretical result for more galaxies and at lower frequencies .",
    "the intrinsic position angle of the plane of polarization of an unresolved spiral galaxy can be estimated from an optical image .",
    "it does not depend on internal faraday rotation or on the spiral pitch angle of the magnetic field ( section  [ model - sec ] ) . in principle",
    ", this property allows the detection of possible faraday rotation by an intergalactic medium , using a large sample of spiral galaxies .",
    "the correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath29 ( figure  [ pa - fig ] ) can be made for a large number of galaxies , subdivided by distance and location in the sky .",
    "if large - scale magnetic fields exist in the nearby intergalactic medium , the correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath29 would show an offset for more distant galaxies in a certain direction .",
    "the rotation measure sensitivity of such an experiment would depend primarily on the sample size of spiral galaxies with integrated polarimetry , and on the longest wavelength at which unresolved spiral galaxies remain polarized sources .",
    "this paper discusses the integrated polarization properties of nearby galaxies from archival data at 4.8 ghz , and models for the integrated polarized emission of a spiral galaxy .",
    "we find that    \\1 .",
    "spiral galaxies can show substantially polarized ( up to @xmath16220% at 4.8 ghz ) integrated radio emission .",
    "the polarization angle of the integrated emission of spirals without a ( strong ) bar is aligned with the apparent minor axis of the disk . barred spirals can also be polarized sources , but do not show a clear correlation of polarization angle with the orientation of the major axis .      \\3 . a sub - sample of nine spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster",
    "does not show a significant difference in integrated polarization properties from the field galaxies in our sample .",
    "this suggests that physical distortions of these galaxies are not so strong that they have a noticeable effect on the integrated polarization .",
    "confirmation by a larger , complete sample is required .",
    "the fractional polarization of integrated emission is smaller for galaxies with a higher radio luminosity .",
    "this result suggests a difference in properties of the magnetic field and/or faraday depolarization in luminous spiral galaxies .",
    "our models for the integrated polarization of axially symmetric spiral galaxies cover the same area in the @xmath26-@xmath63 diagram ( figure  [ diskpol_model - fig ] ) as the observed galaxies without a strong bar .",
    "the models indicate that the main cause of variation in the fractional polarization of galaxies with inclination less than @xmath128 is the ratio of the random to the regular magnetic field component in the disk .",
    "our models provide a probability density function of fractional polarization of spiral galaxies as a function of wavelength that can be used to predict the number of spiral galaxies in deep polarization surveys , and to study the statistical properties of spiral galaxies in such surveys .",
    "the integrated polarization of spiral galaxies opens the possibility to study magnetic field properties and faraday rotation in large samples of spiral galaxies , and in galaxies at high redshift .",
    "a deep 1 - 2 ghz survey with the ska could detect normal spiral galaxies at redshift 1 or higher @xcite with a total intensity flux @xmath163 .",
    "these can be compared in a resolution - independent way with integrated polarization measurements of low - redshift galaxies at the same restframe frequency .",
