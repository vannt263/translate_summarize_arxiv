    "<S> the third variant is called _ einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , after the famous epr paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is an effect by which ensembles of quantum states are remotely prepared by local measurements at distant labs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observable data in steering experiments thus consist of the measurement statistics at one lab and quantum states at another . </S>",
    "<S> these data are compactly described by a joint mathematical object called _ assemblage _ , composed of a conditional probability distribution and a set of density matrices . </S>",
    "<S> hence , epr steering constitutes an intermediate notion between entanglement and bell nonlocality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from their fundamental importance , nonlocal correlations are of practical relevance : they are resources for physical tasks such as quantum key - distribution ( qkd ) @xcite and quantum random - number generation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is a resource @xcite in the device - dependent ( dd ) scenario , defined by well - characterized , trusted quantum measurements . </S>",
    "<S> bell nonlocality is useful for device - independent ( di ) protocols @xcite , i.e. , where the experimenters possess untrusted black - box measurement apparatuses . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , epr steering has been identified @xcite as a resource @xcite for one - sided di situations , where one of the parties has an untrusted black - box device while the other possesses a trusted quantum platform . </S>",
    "<S> fully ( both - sided ) di protocols relax the need for device characterization totally , but at the expense of being very demanding experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one - sided di implementations offer a middle - path alternative , relaxing device characterization only on one side but having , in return , less stringent experimental requirements @xcite for security @xcite than in fully di ones . </S>",
    "<S> this is relevant to any asymmetric situation involving users with different levels of quantum control .    </S>",
    "<S> these developments motivated a great amount of work on the interplay between the different forms of quantum nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> the first problem tackled was that of entangled versus bell nonlocal states ( those capable of exhibiting bell nonlocality ) . </S>",
    "<S> all pure entangled states were proven to be bell nonlocal @xcite , but mixed bell local entangled states were found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , necessary and sufficient conditions for arbitrary 2-qubit states to be bell nonlocal were derived @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a long list of works then followed these pioneering results ( see , for instance , sec . </S>",
    "<S> iii.a of @xcite and refs . </S>",

    "<S> the second problem was that of entangled versus steerable states ( those capable of exhibiting epr steering ) . </S>",
    "<S> unsteerable entangled states , as well as bell local steerable ones , were found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this led to an impressive amount of work : the sets of entangled , steerable and bell nonlocal states were proven inequivalent under general measurements @xcite ; necessary criteria for a two - qubit state to be steerable were found @xcite ; and constructive methods to test for unsteerability of a state were developed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in addition to the many known steering inequalities @xcite , a necessary and sufficient criterion for epr steering has been recently obtained for minimal - dimension assemblages </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we consider a third problem : steerable versus bell nonlocal multipartite assemblages . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a closed - form necessary and sufficient criterion for an @xmath1-partite assemblage with a single trusted device , in possession of a user called alice , to violate , under general measurements [ positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) ] by her , a bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal measurements for the maximal violation are also given . </S>",
    "<S> our theorems assume that alice s measurements are dichotomic and that her system is a qubit , but are otherwise general in the number of outcomes for the untrusted devices and of settings for all parties . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we make only minimal assumptions on the bell inequalities treated , namely , that they are linear and that their violations do not increase under probabilistic local mixings of alice s outputs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , many of the most popular bipartite @xcite and multipartite @xcite bell inequalities are within the range of applicability of our criterion . in addition , for @xmath2 users with 2 inputs and 2 outputs per user , our criterion unambiguously characterizes all bell nonlocal assemblages . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in that setting , our criterion generalizes , in form , recently obtained steering inequalities @xcite . by virtue of this , we provide insight into the detection of epr steering within the framework of bell nonlocality and explain formal links between the two problems . </S>",

    "<S> so , while the former gives a necessary and sufficient condition for 2-input 2-output bipartite bell nonlocality , the latter only provides a sufficient one . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , one can show ( see appendix [ app : steerineq ] ) that , in the basis of @xmath56 in which the bloch - sphere directions associated to @xmath81 and @xmath82 are contained in the plane of @xmath89 and @xmath88 , the correlators involving @xmath91 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> vanish and the lhss of eq . and </S>",
    "<S> . thus coincide ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ compaust ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for every 2-input 2-output bipartite bell nonlocal assemblage there exists a pair of mutually unbiased bases for which the steering in the assemblage is witnessed via a violation of . </S>",
    "<S> the implication was also recently formally proven in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by other reasonings </S>",
    "<S> . the pair of bases is readily obtained from eq . .    _ </S>",
    "<S> concluding remarks_. we have unambiguously characterized all the @xmath1-partite assemblages with a single trusted ( qubit ) system that can violate  under general dichotomic trusted measurements on the qubit  bell inequalities from a very broad family . indeed , most widely used inequalities are within the firepower of our criterion . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the optimal povms for maximal violation were also provided and turn out to always be rank-1 projective von neumman measurements . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the important particular case of two users with 2 inputs and 2 outputs per user , our criterion unambiguously characterizes all bell nonlocal correlations in the assemblage . in that setting </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that the form of the criterion generalizes that of recently obtained steering inequalities , and sheds light back onto the problem of steering detection within the framework of bell nonlocality .    </S>",
    "<S> our results hold for the usual scenario of non - sequential measurements on a single copy of the assemblage . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our criterion is to qubit assemblages what the famous analytical criterion of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for violation of the chsh inequality @xcite is to 2-qubit states , with the difference that we handle more generic bell inequalities and in the multipartite case . </S>",
    "<S> we leave as an open question the conditions for bell violations and bell nonlocality in more general measurement scenarios @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to remark that the optimizations we have solved can also be solved with semi - definite programming ( sdp ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , while sdp can , in general , only give , for each problem instance , a numeric solution , we provided closed - form analytic expressions for the general case . </S>",
    "<S> analytic solutions both carry more information and are more practical than numeric ones . </S>",
    "<S> this is specially relevant in , e.g. , security proofs , which are naturally formulated symbolically and rarely admit numeric manipulations . in turn , here , it was precisely having closed - form solutions what made the conceptual connections with steering inequalities possible .    </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a practical toolbox to study of the interplay between epr steering and bell nonlocality , with potential implications in multipartite cryptographic protocols such as quantum secret sharing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a further interesting prospect would be to explore possible connections with random - number generation schemes that are one - sided di in that they treat photon sources as black boxes @xcite .    _ </S>",
