    "in hierarchical cosmological models such as @xmath2cdm , dark matter halos of lower mass form earlier on average than more massive halos . the virial mass of halos is a key parameter that governs many properties of galaxies and their host halos , e.g. , galaxy morphology and color , baryonic feedback processes , formation redshift , and halo occupation number .",
    "recent numerical simulations , however , have shown that a halo s local environment  in addition to its mass  also affects the formation processes . at a _ fixed _ mass ,",
    "older halos are found to cluster more strongly than more recently formed halos @xcite .",
    "other halo properties such as concentration , spin , shape , velocity structure , substructure mass function , merger rates , and halo occupation distribution have also been shown to vary with halo environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in comparison ,",
    "the formation and properties of dark matter halos depend only on the mass and not environment in the extended press - schechter and excursion set models @xcite .",
    "these models are used widely for making theoretical predictions of halo and galaxy statistics and for monte carlo constructions of merger trees .",
    "the lack of environmental correlation arises from the markovian nature of the random walks in the excursion set model : the change of the matter over - density as a function of the smoothing scale is treated as a markovian process , which by definition decouples the density fluctuations on small ( halo ) and large ( environment ) scales .",
    "this limitation stems from the use of the fourier - space tophat window function as the mass filter .",
    "when a gaussian window function is used , for instance , @xcite finds an environmental dependence in the halo formation redshift , but the dependence is _ opposite _ to that seen in the numerical simulations cited above .",
    "several other attempts at incorporating environmental effects into the excursion set model were not able to reproduce the correlations seen in the simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we aim to derive analytic expressions for halo statistics that depend on halo mass as well as its large - scale environmental density .",
    "to achieve this goal , we begin with the non - markovian extension of the excursion set model by @xcite ( mr10 hereafter ) . in this approach",
    ", a path integral formalism is used to perform perturbative calculations for non - markovian processes of gaussian fields .",
    "a key quantity is the probability that the smoothed matter over - density remains below a critical value down to a certain mass scale ( equation  [ 40 ] of mr10 ) .",
    "they show that this quantity can be written as a multi - variable integral of a gaussian distribution function , which can be worked out exactly in the markovian case , and perturbatively for weakly non - markovian processes ( see  3 , 4 , 5 of mr10 for details ) .",
    "this probability can be used to derive the first - crossing rate for the halo mass function as shown in equation  ( 42 ) of mr10 .    to introduce environmental dependence ,",
    "we modify equation  ( 40 ) of mr10 by first isolating ( , not integrating out ) the dependence of the matter overdensity on the specified environmental scale in this equation .",
    "we then add to the path integral a portion that is between the descendant and progenitor halo mass scales with a slightly higher critical value for halo identification ( corresponding to the halo formation criteria at a slightly higher redshift ) .",
    "the resulting new probability is a function of the environmental density and the descendant and progenitor halo masses .",
    "its derivative with respect to the descendant and the progenitor masses yields the conditional halo mass function as a function of the overdensity of the larger - scale environment , which will be the main result of this paper . in",
    " [ mergerrates ] , we provide a summary of the excursion set model and the path - integral approach to the non - markovian extension . in   3 , we introduce the formalism and perform the main calculation , including the simplification of the final result in the limit of the large scale environment .",
    "at any given time @xmath3 and position @xmath4 , a virialized dark matter halo is formed in the excursion set model if the linear mass overdensity @xmath5 smoothed on the scale of the halo size @xmath6 exceeds a threshold @xmath7 that is determined by the spherical collapse model , and if no larger smoothing scales meet the criterion .",
    "the smoothed density field is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the density contrast about the mean mass density @xmath10 of the universe , @xmath11 is the smoothing filter function , and @xmath6 is the smoothing scale . when @xmath12 is a tophat function in @xmath13-space , the over - density traces out the smoothing scale as a markovian random walk process . instead of @xmath6 , the variance @xmath14 of the density field is often used to denote the length ( or mass ) scale , where @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the power spectrum of the matter density fluctuations in a given cosmological model , and @xmath17 is the fourier transform of the filter function @xmath12 .",
    "as the smoothing radius @xmath6 goes to infinity , @xmath18 goes to zero . in hierarchical models of structure formation such as the @xmath2cdm model , @xmath14 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath6 .",
    "the variables @xmath14 , @xmath6 , and the associated mass , @xmath19 , can therefore be used interchangeably .    in the standard excursion set model",
    ", the first crossing distribution of random walks with a constant barrier @xmath7 determines the halo mass function .",
    "further refinement is achieved by the ellipsoidal collapse model with a scale - dependent @xmath7 @xcite , or a diffusing barrier @xcite .",
    "the resulting halo mass functions are found to agree reasonably well with @xmath1-body simulation results ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the halo mass function , the excursion set model also predicts the halo assembly history .",
    "as the linear density field grows with time , halos are identified on increasingly larger mass scales , which signifies the gain of dark matter mass through mergers or accretion .",
    "statistics such as the halo merger rates , progenitor mass functions , and their relations with the large scale environmental density can all be worked out in this framework .",
    "the calculation of the halo statistics typically treats the change of the smoothed linear density field @xmath20 with a decreasing smoothing scale @xmath18 as a markovian process , in which each step of the random walk is uncorrelated with the previous one .",
    "the markovian assumption therefore decouples the linear density fluctuations below and beyond the halo mass scale , causing the halo properties , such as its formation time and merger rate , to be independent of the density of the halo environment .",
    "this assumption greatly simplifies the calculations and has led to a number of useful analytic results .",
    "the markovianity of the process , however , relies on the density smoothing filter being a tophat function in @xmath13-space , which does not correspond to a well - defined halo mass in real space .",
    "in addition , the decoupling between halo mass and halo environment is not seen in numerical simulations .",
    "a difficulty of the excursion set model is that an unambiguous relation between the smoothing radius @xmath6 and the mass @xmath21 of the corresponding collapsed halo only exists when the filter is a tophat function in real space : @xmath22 . for all other filter functions ( e.g. , tophat in @xmath13-space , gaussian )",
