    "jets are defined as the collimated stream of final state hadrons , produced from the fragmentation of hard scattered partons ( quarks and gluons ) in high energy collisions .",
    "jets serve as tool to connect the final state hadrons with the primarily produced partons and thus they are probe to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "the study of jet shapes provides details of the parton to jet fragmentation with insight to jet tranverse profile .",
    "furthermore , the measurements in pp serves as a baseline reference for similar measurements in heavy - ion ( aa ) collisions , where a highly dense medium is created , to isolate the hot matter effects .",
    "for this analysis , 4.4 x 10@xmath2 minimum bias events recorded by the alice detector at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) during 2011 are used .",
    "events with primary vertex within @xmath3 cm along the beam axis from the geometrical interaction point are analysed .",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed using the combined information from time projection chamber ( tpc ) and inner tracking system ( its ) and tracks with p@xmath4 @xmath5 150 mev / c , @xmath6",
    "@xmath7 @xmath6 @xmath8 0.9 are selected for the analysis .",
    "jets are reconstructed using sequential recombination anti - k@xmath1 @xcite jet clustering algorithm from the fastjet package @xcite .",
    "the differential charged jet cross sections are measured with r = 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.6 using the equation   @xmath9   where @xmath10@xmath11 is the integrated luminosity ( 1.3 nb@xmath12 in our case ) and @xmath13n@xmath14 the number of jets in the selected intervals of @xmath13p@xmath1 and @xmath13@xmath15 .",
    "jet shape observables such as average numbers of charged tracks in a leading jet ( @xmath16n@xmath17 ) , leading charged jet size ( average radius containing 80% of the total jet p@xmath1 , @xmath16r@xmath18 ) and radial distribution of p@xmath1 density about the jet axis ( dp@xmath1@xmath19/dr ) are measured for r = 0.4 .",
    "the jet p@xmath1 spectra are corrected for instrumental effects by the bayesian unfolding technique @xcite using monte carlo ( mc ) events and full detector simulation with geant3  @xcite .",
    "jet shape observables are corrected using a bin - by - bin correction technique .",
    "all the observables are further corrected for the contribution of the underlying event ( ue ) from sources other than hard scattering .",
    "the ue is estimated following the technique used by alice  @xcite and subtracted event - by - event for jet p@xmath1 spectra and on a statistical basis for jet shape observables .",
    "the sources of systematic uncertainties include finite efficiency and momentum resolution , ue estimation and the dependence of correction factors on mc event generators .",
