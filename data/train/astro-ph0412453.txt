    "@xmath0  car is among the most massive and luminous unstable stars of our galaxy . during its `` great eruption '' ( about 1838 - 1858 ) it became one of the visually brightest stars in the sky .",
    "today the star itself is hidden in a bipolar nebula known as the _ homunculus_. it is , due to the dust within the expanding lobes scattering light from @xmath0  car , mainly a reflection nebula ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "temporary spectral changes were recorded on several occasions beginning in 1948 ( see references cited by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and occur approximately every 5.5 years @xcite . the same timescale had earlier appeared in infrared photometry @xcite , and was confirmed by successful predictions of spectroscopic events around 1997.9 and 2003.5 . in each case",
    "the excitation and ionization level of the spectrum decreased for several months . at the same time the x - ray emission first peaks and then plummets during the event @xcite .",
    "the 5.54-year periodicity led many authors to suggest that @xmath0  car has a companion star @xcite .",
    "have proposed earlier that each event involves a shell ejection or similar event .",
    "the periodicity suggests that a companion star may regulate the cycle , but neither of these conjectures has been confirmed . in general the phenomenon",
    "has not yet been explained .",
    "@xmath0  car was observed regularly at high spatial resolution with hst / stis from 1998 through 2002 to separate the star from its nearby ejecta which contaminates all ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "the hst treasury project carried out an intensive monitoring with more frequent observations during its 2003 `` spectroscopic event '' . to complement this program with improved temporal sampling during the `` event '' we observed @xmath0 car with the * u*ltraviolet and * v*isual * e*chelle * s*pectrograph uves , at the _",
    "european southern observatory ( eso ) _ between december 2002 and march 2004 .",
    "we observed the reflected spectrum of the star at the fos4 position ( about 26 south and 28 east of the star ; * ? ? ? * ) which allows us to view the star and the `` event '' from a different angle . at fos4",
    "there is also only a modest amount of contamination by nebular emission from the vicinity of the star .",
    "spectra taken on the star s position and at fos4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_star ] for comparison . at fos4 ,",
    "spectral changes in the stellar spectrum can be observed after a light - travel delay time of roughly 3 weeks .",
    "we also observed the star itself less frequently but coordinated with the hst / stis treasury project .",
    "the scattering surface in the se lobe at the fos4 position ` sees ' the star from a roughly polar direction @xcite while our direct line of sight sees a spectrum representative of the intermediate latitudes @xcite .",
    "thus these two lines of sight allow us to follow the event from different angles .",
    "for example , in the hst / stis spectra of the central star , a deep p  cygni h@xmath1 absorption was present during the 1997 - 98 event but disappeared a few months later . meanwhile , however , the p  cygni absorption did not disappear in the star s spectrum reflected by dust in the southeast homunculus lobe .",
    "a possible explanation for the p  cygni absorption discrepancy is that @xmath0  car s wind may be denser toward its poles , except during each spectroscopic minimum  as discussed by @xcite . in any case , some important observational questions arise . to what extent",
    "does the reflected  polar \" h@xmath1 profile differ from the feature that we observe directly ? does the polar h@xmath1 emission vary during a spectroscopic event , and , if so , in what manner ? here we present partial answers to these questions , and we describe some important details omitted by smith et al .",
    "a companion paper by davidson et al . describes the hst / stis balmer line observations of the central star during 2003 which significantly differed from the previous one observed in 1997 - 98 .",
    "the data presented here are based on observations obtained in service mode between december 2002 and march 2004 with uves at the nasmyth platform b of eso s vlt ut2 ( kueyen ) on cerro paranal , chile . for all observations the standard settings dic1 , 346 + 580 ( blue arm centered at 3460 , red arm centered at 5800 ) and dic2 , 437 + 860 ( blue arm centered at 4370  and red arm at 8600 ) were used .",
    "the observed wavelength range extends continuously from 3100  to 10200  except for small gaps due to the space between the two ccds of the detector mosaic in the red channel .",
    "the primary objective was to observe the reflected stellar spectrum at the fos4 position ( about 26 south and 28 east of the star ) in the homunculus .",
    "the slit was aligned across the se lobe of the homunculus at a position angle of 160@xmath2 . to monitor the 2003 event ,",
    "spectra were taken about every week during the event ( mid may to end of july ) and every month before and after the event time .",
    "no spectra could be taken between mid august and late november due to the very low elevation of @xmath0  car at paranal during this time of the year .",
    "integration times were between 1sec ( on the star ) and 770sec on the fos4 position .    for a reference spectrum preceeding the `` spectroscopic event ''",
    ", we used spectra obtained during the uves commissioning ( dec . 21 , 1999 ) from the eso archive .",
    "they were obtained with the identical set - up as our spectra , but with different slit orientation .",
    "the position angle of the slit was 45@xmath2 , i.e.  about perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the homunculus with offset to the fos4 center .",
    "exposure times for these spectra were 60sec .",
    "observational dates of all spectra used for this analysis are listed in table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "one short and one long exposure were obtained with the dic1 ( 346 + 580 setting ) to record both , the extremely bright h@xmath1 emission and the fainter lines with good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the slit width of all observations was 03 and 04 in the red and blue range , respectively , resulting in a spectral resolution of 80000 in the blue and 110000 in the red arm .",
    "the pixel scales and slit lengths were , respectively , 0246/pixel and 76 in the blue and 0182/pixel and 118 in the red arm .",
    "the data were reduced and two - dimensional spectra extracted using mostly the standard eso pipeline software for uves .",
    "an exception was the order - merging procedure where the eso software did not produce satisfactory results for our data , mainly because the merging of overlapping echelle orders led to below - optimum s / n .",
    "therefore , the order merging was carried out using software developed at the lsw heidelberg @xcite .",
    "all spectral frames were converted after reduction to the same ( heliocentric ) wavelength scale .",
    "each spectrum presented here is an average of an area of about 055 along the slit ( 2 rows in the blue and 3 rows in the red long slit spectra ) extracted at the fos4 position .",
    "we searched for the best extraction region in the longslit , but had to settle for this small extraction region on fos4 to avoid smearing due to velocity shifts across the lobe .",
    "@xcite encountered similar limits using hst / stis spectra .",
    "all spectra plotted in this paper are normalized to continuum being unity .",
    "our july 26 spectrum shows the minimum in the intensities of the high excitation lines , such as hei 6678  and therefore represents the best  event spectrum \" in our data .",
    "the november spectrum indicates that the affected lines brightened significantly afterwards .",
    "the time variation of the h@xmath1 line at fos4 is given in figs .",
    "[ fig_ha ] and [ fig_shift ] .",
    "they seem to be composites of several components .",
    "most obvious are at least three principal emission components which are preliminarily fit by gaussians plus a p  cygni absorption .",
    "all gaussian profiles themselves may again be composites of several components .",
    "it is also possible that a broader absorption ( e.g. on the blueshifted side ) causes one component to appear as two separate ones .",
    "however , for simplicity we used three gaussian .",
    "the centroids of the gaussian are roughly at @xmath3(fwhm @xmath4 ) , 70  ( fwhm @xmath5 ) and 300(fwhm @xmath5 )",
    ". the p  cygni absorption is centered at @xmath6340 . for a comparison",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_ha48 ] the time variation of the h@xmath1 line 48 north - west of fos4 , closer to the star .    during the event",
    "the h@xmath1 profile at fos4 changes , and all components decrease in intensity .",
    "the most notable change is in the 300-profile  the red hump  which disappears nearly completely .",
    "the red hump was very prominent in the 1999 spectrum and reappeared after the event in november 2003 and is present still in march 2004 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_ha ] , [ fig_shift ] ) .",
    "note that the red hump was already weak in december 2002 , long before the event started , as evidenced by brightening in the x - ray @xcite or ir domains @xcite .",
    "the second most important change in the fos4 h@xmath1 spectra is in the p  cygni absorption profile . before and during the event",
    "there is almost _ no _ change in the p  cygni profile . in the more recent vlt spectra ( november 2003  march 2004 ) , however a second component at a higher velocity  centered at about @xmath7 to @xmath8appears",
    "this high velocity component is first visible in the november spectrum , is deepest in january and weaker again in the march 2004 spectrum .",
    "its appearance can not be explained by the light travel time , but rather shows that this change occured later and not necessarily in causal connection to the event .",
    "the travel delay time from the star to fos4 can be estimated from the radial velocity of the emission lines .",
    "due to the expansion of the homunculus the lines are blue - shifted compared to the same lines seen in the star s spectrum .",
    "this method however is depending on a decent model of the expansion of the homunculus and a good measurement of the radial velocities .",
    "we used several sharper [ fe ii ] lines and derive a radial velocity difference of about 93  between the star and fos4 .",
    "this yields a light travel time of approximately 20 days .",
    "the blue emission component shows only very small changes .",
    "of particular interest is the central 70-emission component .",
    "it is intermediate in terms of variation between the red and the blue component .",
    "the h@xmath9 and h@xmath10 lines show in general the same behavior as the h@xmath1 line ( figs .",
    "[ fig_hb ] and [ fig_hh ] ) .",
    "the development of the red hump , however , seems to be less strong going from h@xmath1 to h@xmath10 .",
    "also the shape of the high velocity p  cygni component changes from h@xmath1 where it is more straight to h@xmath10 were a clear second dip is present .",
    "several differences are seen in comparison with the h@xmath1 profile profile in the hst / stis spectra described in the davidson et al .",
    "first a sharp absorption component roughly at @xmath6150  is seen in the hst spectra , taken directly at the star .",
    "this component is absent in fos4 observations , but appears in our spectra in all positions up to 13 north west of fos4 , as well as in a few observations we made centered on @xmath0  car ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_star ] ) .",
    "we therefore confirm this component to be present in an extended area ( roughly 3radius ) around the star in the south east lobe .",
    "relative to the underlying continuum level , and within the uncertainties of measurement , the uves and hst data both show an equally strong long - wavelength wing at velocities above @xmath11 .",
    "this is reassuring , since wings due to thompson scattering should be approximately isotropic in their appearance .",
    "however the line profile is not symmetric and the broadening is much larger on the redshifted side .",
    "this has been observed in supernovae @xcite , too .",
    "a detailed analysis of the scattering processes within the homunculus is definitely needed to better understand this asymmetry , but lies beyond the scope of this paper and will therefore be addressed elsewhere .",
    "it is nevertheless important since high velocity components in the p  cygni absorption might not be visible , or be much deeper due to the presence of thompson scattering wings .",
    "the shape of the h@xmath1 profile in the hst spectra recorded during the 2003 event is mainly flat - topped and has changed since the last event in 1998 in which the shape was more rounded ( see davidson et al . ) .",
    "contrary to this h@xmath1 profile we observe at fos4 ( as discussed above ) a more complex structure of the emission .",
    "this is not an effect of the spectral resolution , but an intrinsic difference of the two sight lines .    before and during the event",
    "there is little or no change in the p  cygni profile as viewed from the fos4 position , the absorption trough is rather stationary at @xmath6340 , and only marginally deepens and broadens during the event ( by about 50 ; figs .",
    "[ fig_ha ] and [ fig_shift ] ) .",
    "this is in remarkable contrast to the hst observations .",
    "there , the p  cygni absorption is absent before the event , develops during the event and lies at about @xmath6500 .",
    "taking the expansion velocity of the homunculus at the fos4 position into account , this is similar to the central velocity of the p  cygni absorption observed in fos4 . here",
    "the absorption lies at @xmath12  but is not corrected for the expansion . for a comparison of our fos4 velocities with measurements from the star , one has therefore to subtract @xmath13 .",
    "consequently the p  cygni absorption would lie around @xmath14 .",
    "the central velocity component ( sharp peak at 70 , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig_ha ] ) is the second major difference between the uves spectra at fos4 and the stis spectra of the star . without this component ,",
    "the h@xmath1 profile at fos4 resembles the h@xmath1 profile of the star , if we ignore the much more pronounced amplitude variation in the red hump observed at fos4 .",
    "this can be understood if the central component is reflected emission from ejecta near the star visible at the fos4 position .",
    "the peaked emission might come from a gas clump , in the vicinity of the star which would have to be bright .",
    "one other quite natural explanation would be that the peak emission is reflected and scattered light of one or more of the weigelt knots .",
    "the weigelt knots show extremely bright and narrow emission lines @xcite .",
    "scattering at the thick walls of the homunculus would broaden these lines and decrease their intensity .",
    "[ fig_star ] shows that velocity of the peak emission in fos4 agrees well with the radial velocity of the weigelt knots seen at the star .",
    "last but not least might the peak emission have its origin in an area called the _ little homunculus _ @xcite .",
    "similar in morphology the little homunculus is a small nebula ( @xmath15 2  in diameter ) within the homunculus .",
    "the width of the peaked line would fit to the expansion velocity of the little homunculus .",
    "the observations can be summarized as follows : the scattered spectrum of the homunculus , which is representative of the more polar region of @xmath0  car , is changing far less than the stis spectrum of the core , which is representative of a more equatorial spectrum ( more precise it sees the star at an angle of 45@xmath2 ) . during the `` event '' , the spectra of pole and equator become more similar .",
    "the change in the emission part may be partly due to changes in the equatorial region .",
    "it has been shown that the balmer lines seen at fos4 show a profile somewhat different from that seen at the star .",
    "the pronounced flat - topped profile of the stis spectra is not observed in the fos4 uves spectra , either because we are really seeing different stellar profiles viewing the star more pole - on or the peak central emission is an additional emission superimposed on a more flat - topped profile as seen in the hst / stis data . the first scenario would imply a different appearance of the event viewed at the equator and viewed from a more pole - on direction . in the second case ",
    "the peak emission is the result from a circumstellar feature  the event looks very much alike from both viewing angles . in both directions a flat - topped profile is seen , but in fos4 with the additional central emission peak . note however that the event view from fos4 still is different as the p  cygni lines are always present as seen from the fos4 but change as seen from the star .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_hstvlt ] we have smoothed our vlt uves fos4 spectra to the same spectral resolution as the hst / stis data .",
    "this figure is directly comparable to fig .",
    "1c in davidson et al .",
    ", with the same line styles used for a dataset taken at nearly the same dates , but taking into account the light travel time . with this delay ,",
    "however , observations should have been done monthly ( as it indeed was planned ) between august and november 2003 to compare to the stis observations in september 2003 . since",
    "no vlt spectra exist between august and november 2003 , we chose the last spectrum before and the first spectrum after this gap to match fig .",
    "1c in davidson et al.as",
    "well as possible with our data .",
    "[ fig_hstvlt ] clearly shows that the flat - topped profile seen in the hst spectra are not seen in the vlt fos4 spectra .",
    "the flat - topped profile therefore is not an effect of the lower spectral resolution of the hst spectra , but is indeed a real difference between the spectrum seen at the star .",
    "the observations presented here show that the spectroscopic event of @xmath0  carinae in 2003 underwent different spectral changes when observed from the fos4 vantage point compared to the line of sight to the star . while a flat - topped h@xmath1 profile was found in the hst / stis spectra on the star position , the fos4 spectra show a multi - component profile with distinct peaks .",
    "if we assume that the emission observed at fos4 is indeed only a scattered spectrum originating from the central source and does not include emission from other sources seen by fos4 , these observations favor a model in which the spectroscopic event is intrinsically different at different stellar latitudes .",
    "so the wind of @xmath0  car appears to be non - spherical , and the event is also non - spherical with the polar region being affected quite differently from the equatorial region .",
    "if the peaked emission is of circumstellar origin the event seen more pole - on is only distinguished by the change of the p  cygni absorption profile which is present at the star but not prominent at fos4 .",
    "the most prominent change at fos4 is the gradual development of the red hump , an emission structure",
    ". some additional emission must be present here , either from a companion star , additional stellar wind or an ejected shell .",
    "the same explanation can be put forward for the relatively narrow central h@xmath1 component in the uves fos4 spectra , if it is not circumstellar .",
    "also the appearance of an additional high - velocity p  cygni component hints to new material between us and ( the pole region of ) the central source .",
    "this absorption component can again be the result of an increasingly faster and denser stellar wind or a shell ejected with this velocity .",
    "the fact that p  cygni absorption is always present at fos4 but only appears in the line of sight to the star during the event as seen in the high spatial resolution hst observations has another implication on the density structure around the central object .",
    "note in this context that p  cygni absorption is always present in the hst observations of the higher balmer lines .",
    "the explanation for this may be that each balmer line is formed at a different distance from the star , implying different optical depth for different balmer lines . in that scenario",
    "the h@xmath1 line is formed further out from the star compared to h@xmath9 or h@xmath10 ( see fig . 15 in @xcite ) . as the event develops , due either to wind ",
    "wind collision in a binary system or to a shell ejection of the primary star , the optical depth in the line of sight increase and p  cygni absorption can form in the h@xmath1 line .",
    "viewed , however , from the poles at fos4 , the optical depth is always high enough to show a p  cygni profile .",
