    "x - ray transients are a subset of the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) which spend most of their lives in a quiescent state , with typical x - ray luminosities below @xmath3ergs@xmath1",
    ". occasionally they exhibit bright x - ray and optical outbursts , which occur irregularly with intervals from a few years to decades or even longer . during the outbursts , the x - ray luminosity increases by a factor of up to @xmath4 in a few days and then decays back to quiescence in a few months .",
    "swift  j1753.50127  is an x - ray transient discovered by the _ swift",
    "_ burst alert telescope ( bat ) on 2005 may 30 as a bright variable x - ray source @xcite .",
    "although the mass of the primary has not been dynamically measured , the system displays a number of characteristics that suggests the binary hosts a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "first , the hard x - ray spectrum at the outburst peak had a maximum ( in @xmath5 ) at @xmath6150  kev @xcite , while the corresponding peaks in neutron star ( ns ) binaries do not exceed 50  kev @xcite .",
    "secondly , the x - ray spectrum of swift  j1753.50127  has significantly hardened during the decline phase , with the photon spectral index reaching values as low as @xmath7 @xcite , which is typical for hard state bhs , but is much smaller than that in binaries hosting a ns @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the x - ray power density spectrum of swift  j1753.50127reveals a strong power suppression at frequencies above @xmath610  hz @xcite , unlike in ns binaries , which show significant power above @xmath6500  hz @xcite . moreover , temporal analysis of the _ rxte _ data @xcite revealed the presence of the low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with a shape typically seen in the bh candidates ( type c qpo , see * ? ? ?",
    "neither x - ray bursts nor pulsations were detected since the initial outburst further hinting towards the bh nature of the central source in the binary .",
    "it is intriguing that 9 yr after the beginning of the outburst , swift  j1753.50127  has not yet returned to the quiescent state .",
    "this unusual behaviour has triggered an interest in the binary . among other properties ,",
    "a challenging task was to measure system parameters .",
    "neither the mass @xmath8 of the primary nor even the orbital period @xmath9 is reliably measured at the moment .",
    "the optical photometry conducted by @xcite and @xcite revealed a light curve with a complex non - sinusoidal morphology .",
    "the detected @xmath63.24  h modulations were attributed to the superhump period , which is known to be slightly longer than the orbital period @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this makes swift  j1753.50127  one of the shortest orbital period bh systems .    the most direct method of estimating the system parameters of the binary system involves optical spectroscopy , which can give the orbital radial velocity curve of the donor star and of the accretion disc around the primary compact object . a precise determination of the radial velocity amplitude of the secondary in a lmxb is of the highest importance as it allows us to set an absolute lower limit for the mass of the compact object .",
    "these measurements are usually done through the analysis of absorption spectra of the secondary . the most appropriate time",
    "to study the nature and dynamical properties of the secondary star in x - ray transients is quiescence , during which light from the star contributes significantly to the visible spectrum . unfortunately ,",
    "for the case of swift  j1753.50127  it will be a complicated task owing to the faintness of the source during a quiescent state .",
    "it is not visible in archival images and can be as faint as @xmath10@xmath621 mag @xcite .",
    "however , some dynamical information about the secondary star can potentially be derived even during outburst .",
    "for example , @xcite detected a large number of very narrow emission line features from the irradiated secondary star in the persistent x - ray binary sco x-1 .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of sharp emission components of the bowen blend in sco x-1 and the x - ray transient gx  3394 caught in an outburst state allowed the determination of the primary masses @xcite .",
    "no time - resolved spectroscopic studies for swift  j1753.50127  were reported to date , even though a few spectra were presented in the past .",
    "the observations near the outburst peak revealed the presence of the double - peaked h@xmath11  and heii  4686 lines @xcite , which seemed to disappear a month later @xcite .",
    "after that the object showed a rather featureless spectrum @xcite .",
    "our photometric monitoring of swift  j1753.50127  revealed that in 2012 the binary has weakened by at least @xmath60.30.4 mag in comparison with the previous spectroscopic observations .",
    "this gave us grounds to suspect that the lines might have become more apparent .",
    "this motivated us to perform time - resolved spectroscopy of swift  j1753.50127  in order to attempt detection of these lines and to estimate the system parameters . here",
    "we present a study of swift  j1753.50127  based on our optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) spectroscopic observations , supported by the optical photometric monitoring .",
    "[ obstab ]    [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,>,>,^ \" , ]             +          a visual inspection of the optical spectra has shown orbital variations in the line profiles .",
    "this is better seen in trailed spectra as variations of the relative intensity of the two peaks in the double - peaked profiles ( see top left panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : dopmap ] ) .",
    "we measured the ews of the emission lines in the phase - folded spectra using the iraf task _ splot _",
    "[ fig : ew ] ) .",
    "the 1@xmath12 errors were estimated from the noise fluctuations in the continuum .",
    "though the obtained ews exhibit rather significant dispersion , none the less we see that they are modulated with the amplitudes of about @xmath1325% of the mean value .",
    "the observed ew minima could be due to an increase in the continuum luminosity when the region of enhanced emission crosses the line - of - sight .",
    "there is , however , an apparent shift between the ew curves and optical light curves ( see the phase - binned @xmath14-band light curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : ew ] ) .",
    "the maximum of the optical flux occurs close to the inferior conjunction of the secondary star at phase 0 , whereas the ew minima are observed around phase 0.2 .",
    "the orbital variation of the emission line profiles indicates the presence of a non - uniform structure in the accretion disc . in order to study it in more detail , we used doppler tomography .",
    "technical details and examples of the application of doppler tomography to real data are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the doppler maps of the heii  @xmath154686 and h@xmath11  emission lines were computed using the code developed by @xcite .",
    "the resulting tomograms are presented in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dopmap ] , whereas the observed and reconstructed emission line profiles are shown in the top panels . to help in interpreting the doppler maps ,",
    "additional symbols are inserted , which mark the positions of the compact object ( lower cross ) , the centre of mass of the binary ( middle cross ) and the roche lobe of the secondary star ( upper bubble with the cross ) .",
    "the circle of radius 600 kms@xmath1  around the center of mass corresponds to the projected velocity of the outer part of the largest accretion disc restricted by tidal forces .",
    "the roche lobe of the secondary has been plotted using the system parameters : @xmath8=3m@xmath2 , @xmath16=0.2m@xmath2 , @xmath14=40(see section  [ sec : syspar ] ) .",
    "the observed sharp asymmetric double - peaked profiles of the emission lines produced the azimuthally asymmetric annuli of emission .",
    "the radii of the annuli are different for heii  and h@xmath11 , reflecting the different peak - to - peak velocity separation in these lines .",
    "however , the overall appearance of the tomograms is rather similar .",
    "they both display the enhanced emission region in the upper - right quadrant .",
    "the origin of this structure is unclear .",
    "it is located far from the region of interaction between the stream and the disc , which is situated to the left of the secondary star bubble . the data",
    "neither show the emission from the donor which is often observed in the cvs during outbursts .",
    "we also note that the h@xmath11  data display the low - velocity component which produces a compact spot of emission located around the centre of mass of the binary in the corresponding doppler map .",
    "the source of this feature is not clear .",
    "it might be a result of poor subtraction of the geocoronal h@xmath11  night sky line .",
    "however , the phase dependence of this line raise a doubt .",

    "two periods are shown for clarity.,height=245 ]      we attempted to derive the radial velocity curve of the compact object in swift  j1753.50127  using the double - gaussian method @xcite , but results were implausible .",
    "this is not a surprise , as the method uses the extreme wings of the emission line profile which are very noisy even in the phase - folded spectra of the object because of their steepness . instead",
    ", the radial velocities were measured by fitting the modelled double - peaked profile ( see details in section  [ sec : modelling ] ) to the observed phase - binned profiles .",
    "all the primary parameters of the model ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) were frozen to the averaged values listed in table  [ lineparamtab ] , but the model profile was allowed to shift along wavelengths .",
    "we used only the heii  @xmath154686 line for this analysis as it has more clear and symmetric profiles than h@xmath11  and also because it is presumably formed in the inner parts of the accretion disc . therefore",
    ", it should represent the motion of the central star with a higher reliability .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radvel ] ( right - hand panel ) .",
    "the errors are the formal model fitting errors estimated with a monte carlo approach .",
    "we made a non - linear least - square fit of the derived velocities to a sinusoid of the form ( equation [ radvelfit2 ] ) , where @xmath0 was replaced by @xmath20 .",
    "this fit gives the semi - amplitude @xmath21 kms@xmath1 , the systemic velocity @xmath22 kms@xmath1and @xmath23 .",
    "the difference between the phase zero - points obtained from the emission and absorption lines is close to 0.5 , as expected if the derived velocities from those lines trace the motion of the two components .",
    "however , it is well known that the parameters obtained with this method are affected by systematic errors , because the emission lines arising from the accretion disc may have severe asymmetric distortions ( see , for example , discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the obtained value of @xmath20 should be used with great caution .",

    "two cycles are shown for clarity .",
    ", height=245 ]",
    "the observed values of @xmath25 are often known to suffer from non - uniform distribution of absorption or emission spectral features on the donor star surface due to the heating effect by irradiation from the x - ray source .",
    "the noncoincidence of the centre - of - mass and the centre - of - light of the donor can result in systematic errors in the determined velocity amplitude @xmath25 .",
    "a mixture of emission and absorption lines in the spectrum of swift  j1753.50127  strongly suggests that irradiation of the secondary plays a significant role .",
    "moreover , the flux at 5000   from a low - mass star with temperature of 3000 k and radius of 2@xmath26 cm at 2 kpc is expected to be considerably smaller than the observed one ( @xmath27 2.5@xmath28 and 7@xmath29 ergs@xmath1@xmath30@xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , no lines from the dark side of the star should be visible in the observed spectrum .",
    "this suggests that the cross - correlation signal likely originates in the irradiated surface of the secondary .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the true value of @xmath0 , a ` @xmath24-correction ' should be applied .",
    "the @xmath24-correction generally depends on the mass ratio and the distribution of spectral line emission or absorption over the surface of the secondary star and can be expressed as ( @xcite ; see also equation 2.77 in @xcite ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass ratio @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the radius of the secondary and @xmath35 is the displacement of the centre - of - light from the centre of mass of the secondary star .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the correction without the knowledge of these parameters . in order to estimate its reliable extreme value",
    ", we adopted the realistic values of @xmath36 ( see section  [ sect : montecarlo ] ) and assumed @xmath37 to be @xmath60.5 that roughly corresponds to the extreme case where the spectral lines come only from the hemisphere closest to the primary . within these assumptions",
    "@xmath38 is in the range 0.880.92 , therefore in the following analysis we use @xmath39 as an illustration for a possible @xmath24-correction .    in theory",
    ", the correction can be larger if emission is tightly concentrated near the l@xmath40-point .",
    "however , this is not supported by observations .",
    "such a compact emission source should be luminous enough to produce a visible structure in the h@xmath11  doppler map .",
    "moreover , in a realistic situation , the accretion disc s outer rim casts a broad shadow on to the donor star , and only relatively small areas near the poles of the donor s facing hemisphere can be directly irradiated by the central x - ray source . in order for the secondary star to be illuminated , indirect irradiation via scattered x - rays",
    "should be taken into account , or there should exist another source of irradiation , located outside the equatorial plane .",
    "both these scenarios imply that sufficiently extended regions on the donor star will be irradiated ( for a detailed discussion , see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the semi - amplitude @xmath0 of the secondary s radial velocity curve and the orbital period @xmath9 give the mass function which sets an absolute lower limit for the mass of the compact object : @xmath41 where @xmath8 is the mass of the compact object , @xmath16 is the mass of the secondary star and @xmath14 is the binary inclination . from the observed velocity @xmath42 kms@xmath1",
    "we can calculate the `` observed '' mass function @xmath43 m@xmath2 . applying the @xmath24-correction",
    ", we obtain the mass function @xmath44 m@xmath2 , which is one of the smallest mass function for a bh lmxb @xcite .    another independent approach to constrain the compact object mass",
    "is to measure the outer disc velocity .",
    "@xcite has shown that assuming the keplerian velocity in the accretion disc @xmath45 the double - peaked profiles can be used to determine the projected velocity @xmath17 of the outer rim of the accretion disc , which , in turn , depends on the mass @xmath8 of the accreting star and the radius of the disc . the largest radius of the accretion disc ,",
    "should it be determined from observations , can further constrain the system parameters .",
    "we measured @xmath46  kms@xmath1  through the modelling of the h@xmath11  emission line , which originates in the outermost part of the accretion disc ( see section  [ sec : modelling ] and table  [ lineparamtab ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that during our observations both h@xmath11  and heii  4686  lines were much wider than they were at the beginning of the outburst , when the peak - to - peak separation for h@xmath11  was 12001300  kms@xmath1@xcite .",
    "this implies that the accretion disc of swift  j1753.50127  has shrunk by about 45 per cent compared to the early phase of the outburst , similar to what was observed in other lmxbs @xcite and in cvs @xcite . in this context",
    "we note that the outer parts of a large accretion disc are under the gravitational influence of the secondary star , which prevents the disc from growing above the tidal truncation radius @xmath47 , where the tidal and viscous stresses are comparable ( @xcite and references therein )",
    ". it can be estimated as ( see equation 2.61 in @xcite ) :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the binary separation . combining kepler s third law with equations  ( [ velkep ] ) and ( [ rmaxa ] ) , we obtain the relation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the projected keplerian velocity of the accretion disc at the tidal radius . adopting torres et al.s value for @xmath17 of 600",
    "kms@xmath1  as an estimate of @xmath51 we get @xmath52 m@xmath2 . using the realistic value of 0.2 m@xmath2  for the secondary mass ( see section  [ sect : comp_mass ] ) , we find that the solutions for @xmath8 for any inclination are in good agreement with the solutions obtained from the mass function with the @xmath24-correction applied ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mass ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the secondary is a low - mass star , otherwise its absorption lines would be much more apparent in the spectrum of swift  j1753.50127 . in order to",
    "be transferring matter on to the compact component , the secondary star must fill its roche lobe .",
    "the relative size of the donor star is therefore constrained by the roche geometry and the donor must obey the period - density relation for the roche lobe filling objects @xcite . if the secondary is a main - sequence star , one immediately gets an estimate for the mass . the empirical and theoretical mass - period relations for a 2.85  h orbital period binary yield the mass of the secondary star in the range 0.170.25 m@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "if the donor is an evolved star , it is likely somewhat inflated relative to isolated main - sequence stars of the same mass , thus the mass inferred from such relation can be considered as an upper limit @xcite .",
    "the recently calculated evolutionary sequences for ns binaries with a 3  h period obtain the secondary masses in the range 0.10.3 m@xmath2@xcite .",
    "we conservatively assume this mass range for the secondary in swift  j1753.50127 .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that the companion mass is rather low , and therefore the bh mass mostly depends on the unknown inclination of the system and the possible @xmath24-correction . even though the bh mass can be rather large for small @xmath14 , there are additional observational reasons which argue against a very low orbital inclination angle .    1 .   the uv spectrum of swift  j1753.50127  is dominated by relatively strong emission lines civ  and heii  without p  cyg absorption components , and no other absorption lines are detected . from studies of cvs with high accretion mass rates ( nova - like stars and dwarf novae in outbursts )",
    "it is known that the appearance of their uv spectra strongly depends on orbital inclination : low inclination systems show mainly absorption features in spectra , intermediate - to - low inclination systems exhibit p  cyg profiles and/or blue - shifted deep absorptions , whereas high inclination systems show strong emission lines @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if these results can be applied to lmxbs whose accretion discs are strongly irradiated by the x - rays from the inner region .",
    "published uv spectra of lmxbs show relatively strong emission lines .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no uv observations of any low or intermediate - to - low inclination systems are available in the literature .",
    "thus , based on the results of the numerical simulations of cvs @xcite , we can put a lower limit of @xmath53 .",
    "the time resolution optical light curves of swift  j1753.50127  obtained during our observations display prominent orbital variations with the amplitude of 0.100.15 mag in @xmath10 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ratir ] ) , whose nature is not yet clear .",
    "the source of orbital modulation can not be the varying aspect of the irradiated secondary star because the maximum of light is observed around phase 0.0 , i.e. inferior conjunction of the secondary star .",
    "this also can hardly be a bright spot or bulge on the outer edge of the disc formed by the impact of the gas stream .",
    "swift  j1753.50127 is still in outburst , thus its accretion disc is in the hot , ionized state .",
    "the observations of cvs and lmxbs show that the bright spot is barely seen during the outburst stage .",
    "most likely , this orbital modulation is due to some substructures in the non - uniform or / and non - axisymmetric accretion disc ( i.e. spiral waves , warps or tidally thickened regions ) .",
    "the detection of the enhanced emission regions in the doppler maps and of the ew variability supports this idea .",
    "it is quite obvious that a low - inclination binary system is unable to produce a relatively large amplitude ew variability and orbital modulation in the light curve .",
    "our simulations have shown ( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) that for more or less realistic parameters of the bright area in the accretion disc it is virtually impossible to obtain the orbital variability with the required amplitude for the orbital inclination @xmath5440 .     in swift  j1753.50127",
    "obtained using a monte carlo simulation of the observed parameters .",

    "the obtained range of masses for swift  j1753.50127  put the binary right into the 25 m@xmath2  gap , suggesting that the object might be formed in the delayed explosion scenario .",

    "our estimates for swift  j1753.50127  further support the existence of compact objects with masses in the range 25 m@xmath2 . a re - analysis of the full set of data is probably required to conclude whether the mass gap still exists .",
    "masses of bhs used to be comfortably above the limit of 3 m@xmath2 . however , a growing amount of measurements suggest that there exist a population of compact objects very close to this limit .",
    "they can be formed either in the processes of the delayed supernova explosion ( such as in simulations of * ? ? ? * ) or by the accretion - induced collapse of the ns ( initially formed in the supernova explosion ) during the common - envelope phase or by accretion from the companion on the hubble time .",
    "it becomes evident that the firm classification based on the compact object mass estimate alone is becoming less and less reliable , and other diagnostic method should be agreed on to serve a criterion to distinguish between bhs and nss .",
    "such a technique will likely be based on the difference of observational appearance of objects with and without solid surface .",
    "the most promising methods are based on the x - ray colour evolution as a function of flux @xcite and on the properties of the broad - band noise @xcite .",

    "the gap marks the dearth of active cvs in this period range , which appear to have smaller radii compared to the roche lobe size .",
    "the traditional explanation of the period gap involves a thermal bloating of the secondary at periods above @xmath63  h due to enhanced mass transfer rates ( due to magnetic braking mechanism ) over those driven by the gravitational radiation losses alone @xcite .",
    "the magnetic braking abruptly stops at this upper limit when the secondary becomes fully convective @xcite , leading to a reduction of the mass - loss rate and , as a result , its contraction .",
    "the binary continues to evolve towards shorter periods as detached system , and eventually the roche lobe becomes small enough to resume the mass transfer .",
    "the fact that swift  j1753.50127  displays an outburst whilst having the period in the middle of the gap supports our suggestion that the secondary is a slightly evolved star , whose radius is larger than that of a main - sequence star of the same mass .",
    "the same conclusion was reached for the lmxb maxi  j1659152 ( 2.4  h , * ? ? ?",

    "for the first time , we performed the analysis of spectroscopic data to determine the system parameters .",
    "our main result is that the primary in swift  j1753.50127  is not at all so massive  its mass in excess of 5 m@xmath2  is highly improbable .",
    "this result not only affects the modelling of spectral properties , but also supports the possibility of existence of compact objects in the range 25 m@xmath2 , the so - called mass gap .",
    "the later conclusion greatly limits the formation scenarios .",
    "for instance , in the rapid supernova explosion mechanisms , it is not possible to produce the compact objects with masses 35 m@xmath2 , even accounting for the binary evolution effects .",
    "we suggest that the primary in swift  j1753.50127  can either be produced in the delayed explosion or be the result of the accretion - induced collapse of a ns .",

    "our data , however , are better described by the orbital period of 2.85  h , in contrast to @xmath63.24  h found by them .",
    "this finding puts the system into the well - known period gap , in which the main - sequence companions do not fill their roche lobes .",
    "the fact that swift  j1753.50127  is still in outburst suggests that the mass transfer proceeds , therefore , the companion has a radius larger than that of a main sequence star of the same mass .",
