    "the stellar mass and star formation rate ( sfr ) of star - forming ( sf ) galaxies are tightly correlated with each other and since @xcite such a correlation is designed as the _ main sequence _ ( ms ) of star - forming galaxies . in a series of seminal papers @xcite it was shown that such tight correlation persists to at least redshift @xmath2 with nearly constant slope and dispersion .",
    "subsequent studies have confirmed the persistence of a ms relation and extended it all the way to at least @xmath3 and possibly as much as @xmath4 .",
    "however , slope , shape , dispersion and redshift evolution of the ms relation can vary substantially from one study to another , with the logarithmic slope of the relation ranging from @xmath1 up to @xmath5 , as illustrated by the compilation in @xcite .",
    "much of these differences can be traced back to the criterion used to select galaxies .",
    "for example , if galaxies are selected in a sfr - limited fashion , such as in uv- or far - ir - selected samples , then no ms is recognisable and the sfr remains roughly constant with stellar mass @xcite , because only galaxies with sfr above threshold are recovered , especially at low stellar masses @xcite .",
    "besides on the first selection of galaxies , the slope of the ms also depends on how galaxies are selected as star forming , e.g. , for being bluer than some threshold colour , or for having a specific sfr above a given value , etc . to obviate to some of these limitations , @xcite have proposed to use the _ ridge line _ of the 3d distribution of galaxies in the space having for axes sfr , stellar mass and number of galaxies in sfr - mass bins , or , equivalently , taking the mode of the sfr in each mass bin . with this definition ,",
    "the resulting ms does not depend on a pre - selection of sf galaxies . using the database of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) @xcite , renzini & peng",
    "have derived for the ms of local galaxies a constant slope of @xmath6 , whereas the dispersion may increase somewhat with mass . using the same database ,",
    "@xcite have decomposed galaxies in their bulge and disk components , finding that the ms slope gets close to 1 if the sfr is plotted as a function of the _ disk _ mass , as opposed to the total stellar mass .",
    "this comes from bulges harbouring very little star formation , if at all , hence contribute mass but not much sfr .",
    "moreover , the fraction of galaxy mass in the bulge component increases steadily with total stellar mass , which then results in a steepening of the ms when the bulge mass is not included .",
    "a similar effect ( ms slope @xmath5 ) is found for pure disk galaxies at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "deviations of the ms from linearity have also been reported , with either a steepening at low masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) or flattening at high masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these features may arise from a number of effects , such as the inclusion among sf galaxies of objects in which star formation is being quenched @xcite , or to the development of a passive bulge within the most massive galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore the effect of the disk inclination on the ms slope and dispersion .",
    "indeed , reddening must be substantially higher for edge - on galaxies compared to face - on ones , and therefore more uncertain the extinction corrections to apply to the derived sfrs .",
    "we also study the contamination of inclined disks in the lower envelope of the ms , hence for the population of galaxies that are most likely characterised by green colours , and are found in the valley between the blue cloud and the red sequence in the colour - magnitude diagram ( schawinski et al .",

    "2015 ) . here",
    "we illustrate the main results of the experiment , having unveiled an inclination effect much stronger than one could have anticipated from the mere extinction correction .",
    "also in this paper we use the sdss - dr7 database , specifically taking sfrs and stellar masses from the mpa - jhu catalogues ( http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr7/ ) .",
    "sfrs have been taken from @xcite , where they are derived from the h@xmath9 luminosity , corrected for reddening .",
    "for galaxies with non - detectable h@xmath9 , agns or composite galaxies , an estimate of the sfr was derived from the strength of the 4000   break ( d4000 ) .",
    "the diameter of the fibers of the sdss spectrograph is @xmath10 , hence fibers sample only a fraction of each galaxy , especially at high masses and low redshift .",
    "aperture corrections were then applied to produce the total sfrs listed in the mpa - jhu catalogues . as it will become clear in the following section , aperture corrections play an important role in determining the results of the present investigation and",
    "therefore we expand briefly on how they were derived for the mpa - jhu catalogue .",
    "the procedure basically follows @xcite with one modification .",
    "the correction is based on the likelihood of the specific star formation rate for a given set of colours , @xmath11 , constructing it on a grid of bins of 0.05 mag in @xmath12 and of 0.025 mag in @xmath13 , where sfr/@xmath14 is the value of the sfr to @xmath15-band luminosity ratio inside the fiber , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the colours , k - corrected to @xmath16 .",
    "the colour of the galaxy outside the fiber was derived by subtracting the fiber luminosities from the total ones , then convolving this estimate of the colour with @xmath11 to get a value for sfr/@xmath14 outside the fiber .",
    "@xcite warned that the results depend on their main assumption that the distribution of sfr/@xmath14 for given @xmath12 and @xmath13 colours is similar inside and outside the fiber .",
    "this assumption may fail for galaxies having a strong bulge component .",
    "the mentioned modification consisted in adjusting slightly the sfr having noted that the original procedure overestimates the sfr of galaxies with low levels of star formation @xcite .",
    "stellar masses , @xmath8 , are taken from from the sed fits of @xcite . in the following we make use of the median values of sfr and @xmath8 , but we have checked that the results are still valid when considering the average ( avg ) values .      , color - coded by the average b / t value in each bin .",
    "the bins are 0.2 dex wide in log(sfr ) and 0.2 dex wide in log(@xmath8 ) , and each bin host a minimum number of 20 galaxies .",
    "the b / t values are taken from the simard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) catalogue , and are computed from @xmath17band images . the black solid line is the ms relation computed by renzini @xmath18 peng ( 2015 ) .",
    "the b / t has its minimum on the ms , and it increases in the upper envelope of the ms , and for green valley and passive galaxies . restricting the analysis to b / t@xmath19 allows us to avoid from the sample passive galaxies and focus on ms and green valley galaxies.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        we use the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s11 hereafter ) bulge - disk decomposition of galaxies in the sdss dr7 photometric catalogue , done with the gim2d code ( simard et al .",
    "in particular , we make use of the decomposition done with a bulge+disk model , where the bulge srsic index is fixed to @xmath20 and the disk component has @xmath21 .",
    "this decomposition gives , together with other parameters , the b / t ratio in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands , and the disk inclination angle , that is @xmath24 for face - on galaxies and @xmath25 for edge - one ones .",
    "other quantities like the b / t ratio within the sdss fiber in the @xmath23 and @xmath22 bands are also given .",
    "in addition , in the s11 catalogue the probability that a double component disk+bulge model is not required to describe a galaxy is stored in the @xmath26 parameter .",
    "@xmath26 is a useful quantity to select trustable disk+bulge galaxies .",

    "one of the first step of this study is to understand the reliability of disk parameters , specifically the inclination angle , for the galaxies we are interested in .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to understand that disk parameters are more easy to retrieve from disk - dominated galaxies , while for bulge - dominated ones it is not trivial due to the presence of a luminous bulge .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the effect of disk inclination on star - forming galaxies and the contamination of inclined disks in the green valley region .",
    "hence , it is useful to try to understand wether the disk inclination angle is reliable for the galaxies we are interested in .",
    "m16 shows that for galaxies in the range @xmath27 the ms region of the sfr-@xmath8 plane is dominated by disk galaxies , with b / t values on the ms up to 0.3 for the most massive galaxies .",
    "the average b / t values increase when moving from the ms towards its upper envelope and towards the green valley and quiescent region . here , for completeness , we repeat the same analysis but considering galaxies in the redshift range of this work : @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ f0 ] shows the sfr-@xmath8 plane divided in bins that are 0.2 dex wide in log(@xmath8 ) , and 0.2 dex wide in log(sfr ) , where each bin is color - coded as a function of the average b / t ratio , as indicated by the color bar on the right . here and",
    "trough the paper , we make use of the b / t ratio computed from the @xmath22 image . in figure",
    "[ f0 ] , the ms is indicated by the solid black line , and its equation is taken from r@xmath18p15 .",
    "it is clear that star forming galaxies are on average disk - dominated , with an increase of the average b / t value on ms at higher stellar mass .",
    "it is evident that galaxies with sfrs up to @xmath29 1 dex below the ms have b / t values that are , on average , smaller than 0.5 .",
    "galaxies with the lowest sfrs have , on average , higher b / ts , due to the presence of a mixed population of red spirals and red ellipticals in the passive region on the sfr-@xmath8 plane ( m16 ) .",
    "we continue our analysis with the comparison of the disk inclination angle from the s11 catalogue , @xmath30 , and the inclination angle given by the minor - to - major axis ratio ( @xmath31 ) of the single srsic - index n=1 model that fits the surface brightness distribution of a galaxy , as from the sdss pipelines ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is done in two bins of b / t ratio , to access the reliability of the disk inclination angle in s11 . in particular , we divide our sample in galaxies with b / t@xmath33 ( left panel of figure [ f1 ] ) , and 0.3@xmath34b / t@xmath350.5 ( right panel ) , to check trends with morphology .",
    "the contours in both panels of figure [ f1 ] encircle the areas where the 68@xmath36 and 95@xmath36 of the population are found .",
    "the magenta solid line marks the 1-to-1 relation , while the blue points are the median @xmath37 in intervals of 10@xmath38 in @xmath30 .",
    "the errorbars in the @xmath39-direction are given from the standard deviation of the @xmath37 distribution in each bin , while the median of the errors in @xmath30 in each 10@xmath38 wide bin give the error bar extension in the @xmath40-direction .",
    "as expected , for disk dominated galaxies the correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath37 is consistent with the 1-to-1 relation and the scatter is very small .",
    "this means that the gim2d code is perfectly able to retrieve reliable disk inclination angles , also when a small bulge is present . for @xmath41",
    "there is a flattening to a value of @xmath42 of the disk inclination angle given from the axis ratio . for galaxies with a larger bulge component ,",
    "0.3@xmath34b / t@xmath350.5 , the correlation is still consistent with a 1-to-1 relation , but the scatter is larger and the slope slightly smaller than 1 . for galaxies with @xmath43 , the disk inclination angle",
    "@xmath37 is always smaller than @xmath30 , and the difference increases for increasing inclination . it is straightforward to understand that this behaviour is the consequence of the fact that a single @xmath21 srsic model is not anymore a good approximation of the surface brightness profile in this range of b / ts . especially in the case of nearly edge - on galaxies , even if the disk axis ratio is small ( and hence the disk highly inclined ) , the presence of a luminous spherical bulge in the centre will result in an increase of the axis ratio that comes out from a single srsic fit .",
    "the analysis shown in figure [ f1 ] tells us that the disk inclination angle of the s11 catalogue is extremely reliable at low b / t values , but we further tested it as a function of morphology .",
    "a perfect tool would retrieve the same distribution of disks inclination angles , independently on how dominant the bulge component is .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f2 ] shows the distributions of the disk inclination angle @xmath30 for different subsamples of galaxies , defined by their b / t ratio , as indicated by different colours . for b / t@xmath44 the distributions are similar , with a peak between 50 and 70 degrees . for galaxies with 0.4@xmath35b / t@xmath340.5 ,",
    "the distribution is broader , but the peak is still between 50 and 70 degrees .",
    "the distribution of disk inclination angles drastically changes when considering galaxies with more dominant bulges : the peak moves between 30 and 40 degrees , due to the presence of a massive , luminous bulge .",
    "this behaviour can be the result of a trend of the gim2d code , well discussed in s11 , of finding spurious disks in bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "hence , we repeated the same analysis of the distribution of disk inclination angles as a function of the galaxy b / t , just considering galaxies for which the statistical f - test confirms the need of a double component model to fit the galaxy surface brightness profile .",
    "this is done , as suggested by s11 , by considering only galaxies with @xmath450.32 , and it is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "we first notice that the peak in the @xmath30 distribution for galaxies with b / t@xmath340.1 slightly shifts between 40@xmath38 and 50@xmath38 ; this is because when we restrict the sample to galaxies with @xmath450.32 we exclude all the pure disks that do not host a bulge , that have a peak in @xmath30 between 60@xmath38 and 70@xmath38 . for galaxies with 0.1@xmath35b / t@xmath340.4 and @xmath450.32 , the distributions of @xmath30 are very similar to the distributions shown in the left panel .",
    "/ t@xmath340.5 , the distribution is broader and the peak is found at slightly larger angles than for smaller b / ts .",
    "the distributions become nearly flat between 30@xmath38 and 70@xmath38 , with a peak between 70@xmath38 and 80@xmath38 for galaxies with b / t@xmath460.5 .",
    "this could be interpreted as the fact that it is easier for the code to retrieve the presence of the disk in a bulge dominated galaxy when the disk is nearly edge - on .",
    "this tests tell us that the code is able to retrieve meaningful disk inclination angles up to b / t @xmath47 0.5 for the whole sample of galaxies .",
    "when a galaxy is strongly bulge dominated , the code tends to find spurious disks and to give them low inclination angles , most likely due to the fact that the axis ratio is controlled by the intrinsic shape of the spheroidal bulge .",
    "we conclude that the disk inclination angle in s11 gives us the possibilities to study the disk inclination effects also on those galaxies that have a certain , non dominant ( b / t@xmath48 , ) bulge component , giving us a more realistic estimate of the angle with respect to the disk inclination angle from the axis ratio obtain from a single sersic model fit .",

    "are characterised by more inclined disks.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in this work we consider only galaxies with petrosian extinction - corrected magnitude @xmath50 , which is the completeness limit of the main galaxy spectroscopic sample , @xmath28 .",
    "we excluded active galactic nuclei ( agns ) from the sample , since sfr rate estimates could be affected by agn emission lines . to do so",
    ", we consider only objects whose spectra are classified as _ galaxy _ , excluding galaxies with _ subclass _ of agn ; these criteria led to the exclusion of @xmath51 of sources which otherwise would have fulfilled the other selection criteria . also , we focus our analysis on galaxies that have @xmath52 .",
    "the sdss dr7 galaxies that satisfy all those criteria are @xmath29520,000 . given the tests on the reliability of the disk inclination angle as measured in s11 and of the distribution of the b / t ratio in the sfr-@xmath8 plane , we focus mainly on the @xmath29320,000 galaxies with b / t@xmath53 . however , we will briefly mention also how the derived sfrs correlate with the axis ratio of bulge - dominated ( b / t@xmath54 ) galaxies .    to correct for incompleteness at low stellar masses",
    ", we applied the @xmath55 correction , where @xmath56 is the maximum volume at which a galaxy with a given h@xmath9 flux would still be detected with s / n@xmath57 .",
    "we underline here that this correction , based on h@xmath9 , is valid only for galaxies whose sfr comes from the h@xmath9 flux .",
    "this is a good approximation since the sfr comes from h@xmath9 for the large fraction of low stellar mass galaxies for which incompleteness needs to be taken into account .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the fraction of galaxies in our sample with sfr from h@xmath9 , as a function of their position in the sfr-@xmath8 plane .",
    "this fraction is always very large on the ms , with average values always above 70@xmath36 . for galaxies with m@xmath58",
    "this fraction is @xmath59 on the ms and its upper envelope , while it decreases to @xmath60 at @xmath61 dex below the ms .",
    "hence we can safely say that the incompleteness correction accounts for the majority of galaxies in the region of the sfr-@xmath8 plane in which we are interested . at higher stellar masses ,",
    "the fraction of star forming galaxies with sfr from h@xmath9 decreases on the ms , and more rapidly when moving from the ms to its lower envelop , but here the spectroscopic completeness is high , hence the correction is not needed .",
    "it is nevertheless important to underline that the sfr from d4000 should be less affected by dust extinction than sfr from h@xmath9 .",
    "the systematic change along the ms in the fraction of sfrs derived from h@xmath9 ( or d4000 ) may introduce a bias in e.g. , the derived slope of the ms or in the population of the green valley , an aspect we do not investigate further in the present paper .",
    "if we had a perfect tool to derive the sfr of galaxies the results should be independent on their aspect with respect to the observer . in practice , however , our tools are not perfect . edge - on galaxies are obviously more affected by reddening and extinction than face - on ones and reddening corrections are therefore more uncertain .",
    "in addition , self - extinction is not the only disk - inclination dependant effect that can result in a biased sfr estimate .",
    "in fact , for galaxies that have intermediate morphology , the inclination of the disk translates on the portion of the disk that enters the fiber , as we will discuss later .",
    "for example , a face - on galaxy with b / t@xmath290.5 at low redshift , will have a fiber sfr that is substantially given by the bulge , and hence it is likely to be extremely low . on the contrary , when observing the same galaxy when the disk is edge - on , the fiber sfr will also have the contribution of the disk , even if it might be underestimated due to its internal extinction . to obtain the total sfr of a galaxy ,",
    "a substantial aperture correction is applied , which relies on simplifying assumptions that may introduce errors and biases .    here",
    "we want to study the effects of disk inclination on the determination of the galaxy sfr and , as a consequence , on the slope , shape and dispersion of the ms of sf galaxies .",
    "we start our analysis by showing how the disk inclination angle varies along the sfr-@xmath8 plane for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "results are shown in figure [ f5 ] , where each bin in stellar mass and sfr has been colour - coded as a function of the average value of the disk inclination angle , @xmath30 , in each bin . the black solid line is the ms of r@xmath18p15 .",
    "it is clear that the highest average disk inclination angles run parallel to the ms , but offset by about 0.5 dex .",
    "galaxies that are above the ms are characterised by lower average disk inclination angles . for sfrs @xmath291 dex below the ms ,",
    "the average inclination angle is between @xmath62 , i.e. in the range of the most probable disk inclination .",
    "the behaviour of the disk inclination angle in the sfr-@xmath8 plane clearly reveals the presence of biases in the estimate of the sfrs .    to further investigate the dependence of the sfr estimate on the disk inclination angle , we plot in figure [ f6 ] the distribution of the sfr in different bins of stellar mass ( 0.25 dex wide ) , increasing from left to right , and in different bins of disk inclination angle ( from top to bottom , as indicated ) , for galaxies with b / t@xmath350.5",
    "the entire sample ( @xmath63 ) is illustrated in the bottom row .",
    "all the panels show the classical bimodal distribution for sf and for quenched galaxies , with the quenched peak becoming progressively more prominent with increasing mass .",
    "the star - forming peaks have been fitted with a gaussian that is shown in red , and the resulting mean ( @xmath64 ) and dispersion ( @xmath65 ) values are reported in each panel together with the fraction of galaxies in each bin .",
    "we fit only the right part of the sf distribution , to avoid a shift of the mean due to the likely presence of quenching galaxies in the _ green valley_. we can identify different effects of the inclination . for each stellar mass bin ,",
    "the peak of the sfr distribution moves to lower values with increasing inclination angle .",
    "this difference in the peak position between lowest and highest disk inclination bins is @xmath0 dex for galaxies with @xmath66 , and it increases with increasing stellar mass , up to @xmath67 dex for the most massive galaxies .",
    "also , for a fixed stellar mass bin the dispersion of the star - forming gaussian increases with increasing disk inclination angle .",
    "this effect is relatively small ( up to 0.1 dex in the most massive galaxies ) .",
    "a consequence of the shift to lower values of the sf peak is the progressive partial filling of the green valley , which almost disappears for the most massive , nearly edge - on galaxies .",
    "when considering the whole sample , irrespective of inclination , the distributions closely resembles those for the most probable disk inclination , i.e. @xmath68 .    for the most massive galaxies , @xmath69 , a change in the relative strength of the two peaks in the sfr distribution , the quenched and star forming ones , is also noticeable . with the disk inclination angle increasing from 0@xmath38 to 90@xmath38 , the peak of passive galaxies becomes less prominent , in favour of a more significant sf peak .",
    "more massive ms galaxies are , on average , more bulge dominated , hence the fiber samples different portions of the disk depending on the disk inclination angle . for",
    "nearly face - on galaxies the fiber may sample just the passive bulge and the whole galaxy is assigned a low sfr . with increasing disk inclination angle , the portion of the disk that enters the fiber increases , so the galaxy is recognized as star - forming and assigned a high sfr .",
    "this is further discussed in section 4.1 .        as discussed in section [ data ] , a key step in determining the sfr of a galaxy is the aperture correction , hence we now check whether the shift in the sf peak is present also when considering the fiber values , i.e. , the sfr measured within the portion of the galaxy sampled by the fiber , without applying the aperture correction .",

    "we notice that the fiber sf peaks at lower sfr values for nearly face - on disks ( @xmath72 ) than for higher disk inclination angles ( 30@xmath7370@xmath38 ) .",
    "this is because the bulge component of ms galaxies becomes more prominent for increasing stellar masses ( see figure [ f0 ] ) , and hence the fiber sfr of a galaxy with a face - on disk is affected by the passive bulge component .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that , for the most massive galaxies with disk inclination angle between 0@xmath38 and 30@xmath38 , the passive peak is more predominant in the fiber sfr distribution ( figure [ f7 ] ) than in total sfr distribution ( figure [ f6 ] )",
    ". for increasing disk inclination angles ( @xmath74 ) , the sf peak shifts to smaller values ( @xmath290.2 dex ) , and is more predominant than for lower disk inclination angles .",
    "we infer that since a larger portion of the disk enters the fiber , a larger number of galaxies is identified as star - forming , but the dust correction results in an underestimate of the sfr .",
    "in fact , morphology alone can not account for this as dust correction shifts the fiber sf peak to lower values ( quantitatively less pronounced ) , even for nearly edge - on pure - disk massive galaxies .    the varying trends in the position of the fiber sfr peak as a function of disk inclination , for galaxies with different stellar masses , can be attributed to their dust content . as shown in brinchmann et al .",

    "we know that the s11 catalogue is affected by the presence of spurious disks in bulge - dominated galaxies , and that those disks are given , on average , lower inclination angles .",

    "we can observe , especially for more massive galaxies , a progressive filling of the green valley region with increasing disk inclination .",

    "figure [ f6 ] illustrates the two major inclination effects , which grow more prominent with increasing stellar mass : with increasing disk inclination- ( 1 ) the sf peak shifts to lower sfrs , and ( 2 ) the strength of the sf peak increases relative to the peak of quenched galaxies .",
    "we believe that they reflect two inclination - dependant effects that have a role in determining the total sfr of a galaxy and are dependent on the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "the first effect is independent of morphology and is related to dust obscuration . for more inclined galaxies as photons",

    ", the aperture correction acts together with the dust content of the galaxy resulting in a shift of @xmath82 dex towards lower values of the @xmath81 sf peak for a galaxy going from a nearly face - on disk to a nearly edge on disk .",
    "the second effect is dependant on galaxy morphology and it is more evident for more massive galaxies , since ms massive galaxies are characterised by larger b / t values than ms counterparts at lower stellar mass . in particular , as we discussed earlier , we believe that this effect is due to a trend , with disk inclination , of the bulge and disk fractions that are sampled by the fibers . to show this effect , we make use of the fiber b / t ratio , b / t@xmath77 , that is given in the s11 catalogue . as for the total b / t ,",
    "we use here the b / t@xmath77 computed from the @xmath17band . in fig .",
    "[ f_ref ] , b / t@xmath77 is shown as a function of the disk inclination angle , @xmath30 , for galaxies in different bins of total b / t ( in different colours ) and stellar mass in the range 10@xmath83 - 10@xmath84 . as expected , there is a weak trend of decreasing b / t@xmath77 as the disk inclination increases , due to a larger fraction of the disk entering the fiber .",
    "this effect is small as the total b / t is fixed and the decrease in b / t@xmath77 with increasing @xmath30 is steeper for galaxies with larger b / t .",
    "the slope also varies with stellar mass , and it is steeper for more massive galaxies than for lower mass ones .",
    "this is because at fixed b / t the bulge component in more massive galaxies is characterised by a larger radius than the bulge of a lower mass galaxy , hence the variations with disk inclination within the fiber are stronger . in massive , face - on star - forming galaxies the @xmath10 fibers sample in most cases just the bulge of the galaxies . since most bulges are quenched most fibers sample just the quenched part of the galaxies .",
    "apparently , in such cases the aperture correction is not sufficient to properly include the full sfr of the disk . however , as the inclination increases , an increasing fraction of the sf disk enters the fiber , the galaxy is recognised as sf and the aperture correction goes some way towards including the sfr of the disk .",
    "still , quite possibly not all of it , as we know that the aperture correction and dust content are responsible , in massive galaxies , of a shift of @xmath82 dex towards lower values of the @xmath81 sf peak .",
    "the shift of @xmath1 dex in the position of the sf peak in the most massive edge - on galaxies indicates that the actual sfr is on average underestimated by a factor @xmath2 for these galaxies , a quite significant effect .",
    "overall , this extreme inclination effect is relevant for only a small fraction of galaxies , say @xmath85 of the whole sample , and especially confined to the most massive galaxies .",
    "therefore , by and large the bulk of the population is reasonably well accounted for .",
    "but minorities count for some interesting issue , as discussed next .",
    "figure [ f8 ] shows the sfr-@xmath8 plane where each bin in log(sfr ) and log(@xmath8 ) has been colour coded as a function of the space density in that bin , computed as the ratio of the number of galaxies and the average @xmath56 , and it is indicated by the greyscale .",
    "the best fit ms relations , i.e. , log(sfr )  =  @xmath86 , computed in different bins of disk inclination angle , are shown in figure [ f8 ] with different colours .",
    "in each stellar mass bin , the ms value and dispersion are the values written in red in each panel of figure [ f6 ] , and are the peak and dispersion of the gaussian curve obtained from the fit to the right part of the sf distribution of sfr ( gaussians are shown in red in figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "the slope and intercept of the ms relation in each disk inclination angle interval are obtained from a linear regression using the ms values in each stellar mass bin , covering the range ( @xmath87 ) . the resulting sfr-@xmath8 relation for the whole sample of sf galaxies ( black dotted line in figure [ f8 ] )",
    "has a slope of @xmath88 and an intercept of -7.12 .",
    "if we limit the stellar mass range to @xmath89 , hence avoiding the most massive bin , for the whole galaxy sample we obtain @xmath90 , that is the slope found by @xcite .",
    "for the subsample of galaxies characterised by nearly face - on disks ( @xmath72 ; in blue in figure [ f8 ] ) we obtain a slope @xmath91 , with @xmath92 .",
    "galaxies with disk inclination angle between @xmath93 ( in green ) have a slope of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , while for disk inclination angle between and @xmath96 ( in yellow ) the slope is smaller and the intercept is larger : @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "finally , for nearly edge - on disks , ( @xmath99 ; in magenta in figure [ f5 ] ) the slope is flatter , @xmath100 , and the intercept larger , @xmath101 .",
    "hence , the ms becomes progressively flatter and the intercept increases when considering galaxies with increasingly inclined disks .",
    "in addition to the change of slope and intercept of the ms for different disk inclination angles , another effect that seems clear from figure [ f8 ] is that the lower envelope of the ms relation and the green valley region seem to be contaminated by galaxies with highly inclined disks .",
    "we analyze this effect in the next section .",
    "the shift to lower sfrs of the sf peak of massive galaxies with increasing inclination has an adverse effect on efforts of identifying really _ quenching _ galaxies , i.e. , galaxies that have left the main sequence , their sfr is dropping , and are destined to join the _ graveyard _ of quenched galaxies . even if the total number of high inclination galaxies is relatively small",
    ", within the green valley they may even outnumber the truly quenching galaxies .        to quantify the contamination of high - inclined disks in the green valley , we plot , for each stellar mass bin , the fraction of galaxies with disk inclination @xmath99 , @xmath102 , as a function of the log(sfr ) distance from the ms , @xmath103 . here ,",
    "the ms values are the ones obtained for the total population of galaxies , regardless of the disk inclination .",
    "@xmath103 has been computed in bins that are 0.2 dex wide , and it is negative for galaxies above the ms , positive for galaxies below the ms .",
    "results are shown in figure [ f9 ] : the left panel shows galaxies with b / t@xmath350.3 , while in the right panel galaxies with 0.3@xmath34b / t@xmath350.5 are shown , to underline trends with morphology . each stellar mass bin",
    "is indicated by a different colour .",
    "there is a strong increase of the fraction of nearly edge - on galaxies , @xmath102 , when moving from the upper envelope of the ms towards its lower envelop . for disk galaxies with m@xmath104m@xmath105",
    ", @xmath102 computed 0.8 dex below the ms is 4 times larger than @xmath102 at 0.6 dex above the ms . for more massive disk galaxies , the peak value of @xmath102 is smaller , @xmath106 for m@xmath107m@xmath105 and @xmath108 for m@xmath109m@xmath105 .",
    "in fact , the sfr of the most massive galaxies is derived mainly from the d4000 break as soon as we move below the ms . as shown in figure 4 , for m@xmath110m@xmath105 , the fraction of galaxies that have sfr from @xmath111 is @xmath2970@xmath36 on the ms , and quickly drops to @xmath2920@xmath36 at @xmath290.8 dex below the ms .",
    "since the sfr from d4000 is less affected by reddening as it is derived from a break of the continuum , the increase of @xmath102 from the upper to the lower envelop of the ms is milder for the most massive galaxies .",
    "the increase in @xmath102 is less steep for galaxies with 0.3@xmath34b / t@xmath350.5 ( right panel in figure [ f9 ] ) , where @xmath102 computed at 0.8 dex below the ms is a factor from 2 to 3 larger than above ms , and it shows less variation as a function of stellar mass .",
    "we believe that the different increase in @xmath102 for galaxies with different morphology could be caused by two effects : 1 ) the disk inclination angle in nearly edge - on disks might be underestimated by s11 for galaxies with @xmath112b / t@xmath350.5 , that mainly populate the lower envelop of the ms , and 2 ) the increase in the fraction of sfr from d4000 when moving from the ms towards its lower envelop is stronger for intermediate b / t galaxies than for disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "it is indeed clear that , at any stellar mass , the fraction of galaxies with highly inclined disks increases when moving from the upper ms envelope toward the lower ms envelope and the green valley region .",
    "this rises two important points : 1 ) there is a fraction highly inclined disks _ intruders _ in the green valley that should be removed if the goal is to identify galaxies in which the quenching is ongoing , and 2 ) the scatter of the ms seems to be dependent on the disk inclination angle , and hence the relation could be tighter when correcting for the inclination effect .",
    "we have used the spectroscopic catalogue of sdss dr7 and the bulge - disk decomposition of simard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to study the effects of disk inclination on the ms of star - forming galaxies and the contamination of highly inclined disks in the green valley region .",
    "the main findings of this work can be summarized as follows :    * the peak of the total sfr distribution of star - forming galaxies shifts to lower values with increasing disk inclination angles .",
    "such a shift amounts to @xmath113 dex for log@xmath114 , and increases to @xmath67 dex for more massive galaxies .",
    "the dispersion of the best - fit gaussian to the sf peak slightly increases with increasing disk inclination angles , but this is a small effect ( at most @xmath115 dex in @xmath65 ) . *",
    "when considering the fiber sfr , in less massive galaxies we observe an opposite trend than the one that characterises the total sfr with increasing disk inclination angle .",
    "this implies that , for low stellar masses , the shift of @xmath116 dex towards lower sfr in the total sf peak is caused by the aperture correction applied in brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . for more massive galaxies",
    ", we observe an average shift of the sf peak of 0.2 dex towards lower sfr values when considering nearly edge - on disks as compared to galaxies with 30@xmath7370@xmath38 . for galaxies with nearly face - on disks ,",
    "the peak of the sfr distribution of star forming galaxies is found at lower values than for galaxies with 30@xmath7370@xmath38 .",
    "this shift to lower fiber sfr values in massive galaxies with nearly face - on disks is due to the presence of a massive non - star - forming bulge in the the sdss fiber . *",
    "the relative strength of the sf and passive peaks of the sfr distributions is a function of inclination , particularly at high stellar masses , with the sf peak growing more prominent with increasing inclination .",
    "this effect reflects a change in the morphology of ms galaxies , that at high stellar masses are characterised by an increase of the bulge component . for a galaxy at a given stellar mass and b / t ,",
    "the relative fractions of disk and bulge within the fiber are a function on the disk inclination , with the bulge fraction that decreases for increasing disk inclination angle . *",
    "the shift in the sfr peak with increasing inclination is the result of the combination of the different effects explained above . at low stellar masses , ms galaxies",
    "are mostly pure disks , and the shift is attributed to the aperture correction that is applied to compute the total sfr from the fiber sfr . at larger stellar masses",
    "the dust content of galaxies increases and the final shift of the sf peak in nearly edge on disks is the result of : 1 ) extinction correction to the sfr being systematically underestimated in high inclination galaxies , 2 ) aperture correction , and 3 ) increase of the b / t ratio in ms galaxies . * for the subsample of nearly edge - on galaxies , the ms relation is significantly flatter than for the total sample , with a slope of @xmath117 , with respect to the @xmath91 for the whole sample .",
    "also the intercept significantly differs , going from -7.31 ( whole sample ) to -5.37 ( nearly edge - on ) .",
    "* the fraction of galaxies with disk inclination angle @xmath118 is a strong function of the position in the sfr-@xmath8 plane with respect to the ms .",
    "in fact , the fraction of disk dominated galaxies with @xmath118 increases by a factor of @xmath119 at all stellar masses when moving from 0.8 dex above the ms to 0.8 below it .",
    "when considering more bulge dominated galaxies ( 0.3@xmath34b / t@xmath350.5 ) , the effect is still important , but the fraction of galaxies with highly inclined disks changes by a factor of @xmath120 from the upper to the lower envelope of the ms .",
    "galaxies characterised by highly inclined disks are likely to be strongly obscured , hence their sfr estimates are more uncertain .",
    "@xcite and @xcite conclude that significant amounts of dust are present in inclined spirals , and that edge - on disks are the reddest objects in the local universe . knowing that , many recent works which focus on the study of quenching mechanism of galaxies based on a colour selection of the galaxy samples tend to remove inclined disks to avoid their obscuration problem ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that the effect of inclination is small , and that the green valley is not appreciably depopulated after correcting for dust extinction .",
    "still , schawinski et al . (",
    "2014 ) did not consider green valley galaxies with intermediate morphology , which are the relative majority in the morphological classification of galaxy zoo . in principle , the green valley region can provide information on the nature and duration of the process that causes the transition of a galaxy from the blue cloud to the red sequence or , in other terms , from the ms to the passive region of the sfr-@xmath8 plane . for this reason , a careful estimate of the galaxy population of the green valley can not proceed without taking the disk inclination into account , as we have shown that a large fraction of highly inclined disks tend to fill the green valley and lie in the lower envelope of the ms relation .",
