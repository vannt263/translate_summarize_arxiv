    "in recent years much of the effort in theoretical physics has gone into the study of the observed present accelerated expansion of the universe first reported in @xcite through observational data from type ia supernovae .",
    "subsequent work on type ia supernovae @xcite , the cosmic microwave background @xcite , and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , all support the initial observations that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "this late - time acceleration of the universe is driven by a fluid / field generically called dark energy .",
    "very little is known about dark energy . within the context of string theory",
    "there is a model for the _ early - time _ accelerated expansion of the universe associated with inflation .",
    "this string - theory - motivated model for inflation is called dirac - born - infield ( dbi ) inflation @xcite , and it is driven by the open string sector through dynamical dp - branes .",
    "dbi inflation is a special case of k - inflation models @xcite .",
    "it was originally thought that dbi inflation models would yield large non - gaussian perturbations which could be used to verify or falsify these models and by extension to test string theory @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent work has shown that this may not be the case , and that the simplest dbi models are effectively indistinguishable from standard field - theoretic slow - roll models of inflation @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we examine variants of these dbi models as a mechanism , not for the early - time acceleration of inflation , but for the observed late - time acceleration .",
    "our dbi scalar field will play the role of dark energy .",
    "the action for our scalar dbi field is taken to have the form found in ref .",
    "@xcite . @xmath0 ~,\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the scalar dbi field , @xmath1 , is spatially homogeneous so that its spatial derivatives can be ignored .",
    "this is in accord with the fact that dark energy seems to be very homogeneously distributed .",
    "note that @xmath1 has a nonstandard kinetic energy term which yields a standard kinetic energy term if one expands the square root to first order in @xmath2 .",
    "for a pure ads@xmath3 geometry with radius @xmath4 , the warped tension @xmath5 is the d3-brane tension with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the string coupling , @xmath8 is the inverse string tension , and @xmath9 is the t hooft coupling in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "@xmath10 is the potential arising from interactions with ramond - ramond fluxes or with other sectors @xcite .",
    "here we take the potential to be quadratic , @xmath11 , and the associated d - brane is in the anti - de sitter throat @xcite .    in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw )",
    "metric with scale factor @xmath12 , it can be shown that the energy density @xmath13 and the pressure @xmath14 of the dbi scalar field are given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 has the form of a lorentz boost factor , @xmath17 in this paper we analyze this system of a dbi dark energy field interacting with dark matter in terms of late - time scaling solutions .",
    "such models are different from the original work in ref .",
    "@xcite which studied the dynamics of a dbi field plus a perfect fluid but with no interaction between the dbi field and the perfect fluid",
    ". in the course of our analysis of this model of dbi dark energy interacting with dark matter , we find that for certain parameters there are late - time attractor solutions or fixed points in the phase space of the parameters .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we write down two possible phenomenological interactions between the dbi dark energy scalar field with the dark matter fluid . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the autonomous equations in terms of the relevant variables of dbi dark energy interacting with dark matter .",
    "we find the fixed points in the phase - space flow of these variables .",
    "we also discuss the stability ( i.e. stable fixed point , unstable fixed point or saddle fixed point ) of fixed points and determine if the fixed points correspond to late - time accelerated expansion or not .",
    "of particular importance will be stable fixed points which lead to late - time accelerated expansion . finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "cosmological evolution is thought to be largely dominated by dark energy and dark matter .",
    "dark energy gives a gravitationally repulsive effect while dark matter is gravitationally attractive .",
    "usually there is no interaction between these two components such as in the model in ref.@xcite where graded lie algebras were used to give a unified theory with both dark energy and dark matter , but without any interaction between these two components .",
    "there has been work such as the two measure cosmological model of ref .",
    "@xcite where there is some interaction between the dark energy and dark matter components of the model .",
    "however , since the gravitational effects of dark energy and dark matter are opposite ( i.e. , gravitational repulsion versus gravitational attraction ) and since dark energy appears to be very homogeneously distributed , while dark matter clumps around ordinary matter , one expects that any interaction between these two dark components of the universe would be weak . in this paper",
    "we will consider models where there is an interaction between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "the dark energy component will come from the dbi scalar field in eq . with energy density @xmath18 and pressure @xmath14 , and",
    "the dark matter component will come from a fluid with an equation of state @xmath19 . considering a spatially flat friedman - robertson - walker background with scale factor @xmath12 , and allowing for creation / annihilation between the dbi scalar field and the dark matter fluid at a rate @xmath20 ,",

    "thus the addition of a coupling between dark energy , in the form of a dbi scalar field and the dark matter fluid does not appear to contribute to the existence of accelerated expansion for points ( d3 ) and ( d4 ) in model ii .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached for model i where the stable fixed points with accelerated expansion did not depend on the parameter @xmath29 which was a measure of the coupling between dark energy and dark matter for this model . however , for model ii one can see , by looking at the  stability \" column of table [ tab04 ] that whether or not a given fixed point is stable _ does _ depend on @xmath30 and therefore on the coupling between the dbi field and the dark matter fluid . in particular in order for the critical points ( d3 ) and ( d4 ) to lead to accelerated expansion _ and _ to be stable one needs to restrict the coupling parameter @xmath30 between the dbi dark energy and dark matter fluid via eq . .",
    "although we have only examined two specific types of couplings between dark energy ( in the guise of a dbi scalar field ) and dark matter , we will tentatively advance some general conclusions about such models :    \\(i ) the existence of fixed points with accelerated expansion does not depend on the coupling between the dark energy and the dark matter .",
    "one can make a general argument to support this conclusion .",
    "dark matter will fall off like @xmath142 ^{-3}$ ] , while if the dark energy is to lead to late - time acceleration it will act like a cosmological constant which falls off like @xmath142 ^0 \\rightarrow$ ] constant . at late times",
    "the @xmath142 ^0 $ ] behavior will always dominate the @xmath142 ^{-3}$ ] behavior .",
    "\\(ii ) while the coupling to dark matter does not seem to play a role in the existence of fixed points with accelerated expansion it can play a role in their stability . for example , in model ii the stability of the fixed points ( d3 ) and ( d4 ) , which had accelerated expansion , depended on the dark energy - dark matter coupling parameter @xmath30 .",
    "however for model i none of the fixed points stability depended on @xmath29 , the coupling parameter for this model .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) dark energy interacting with dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the dbi dark energy model considered here has a scalar field with a nonstandard kinetic energy term , and has potential and brane tension that are power - law functions . </S>",
    "<S> the new feature considered here is an interaction between the dbi dark energy and dark matter through a phenomenological interaction between the dbi scalar field and the dark matter fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze two different types of interactions between the dbi scalar field and the dark matter fluid . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we study the phase - space diagrams of and look for critical points of the phase space that are both stable and lead to accelerated , late - time expansion . in general </S>",
    "<S> we find that the interaction between the two dark components does not appear to give rise to late - time accelerated expansion . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interaction can make the critical points in the phase space of the system stable . whether such stabilization occurs or not depends on the form of the interaction between the two dark components . </S>"
