    "<S> here we propose to induce magnetism in semiconductor utilizing the unique properties of the interstitial defect to act as the magnetic impurity within the @xmath0-pbo crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the pb@xmath1 interstitial generates the @xmath2-localized state with two on - site electrons to obey the hund s rule for their ordering . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that instead of pb interstitial other non - magnetic impurities of @xmath3 outer shell configuration can be applied to induce d@xmath4 magnetism with possibility to tune the local magnetic moments @xmath5 by varying a number of electrons @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic coupling between such defects is found to be driven by the long - range order interactions that in combination with high defect solubility promises the magnetic percolation to remain above the room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.5truecm    spintronics has recently emerged as a widely successful technology that exploits the principles of magnetism , but the classical metal ferromagnets are not applicable there . </S>",
    "<S> that has led to the creation of a new branch of research directed at semiconductors exhibiting magnetism at room temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first success in this regard was with the so - called `` diluted magnetic semiconductors '' created by doping semiconductors with magnetic ions whose inner @xmath7 or @xmath8 shells being partially filled that allows the ferromagnetic spin alignment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a keen interest on ferromagnetic semiconductors also arose when non - magnetic materials were discovered to demonstrate magnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> origin of so - called @xmath9 magnetism was proposed to be due to localized @xmath10 states : vacancies create a network of unpaired electrons and as interaction between such defects can demonstrate the long - range order , their magnetic coupling occurs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we propose to induce @xmath9 magnetism by forming the interstitial defect pb@xmath1 ( pb@xmath1:@xmath11 outer shell ) within the crystal structure of the tetragonal lead oxide @xmath0-pbo . </S>",
    "<S> it generates the state occupied by two @xmath2-unpaired electrons pb@xmath1:@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> ordering of the localized electrons pb@xmath1:@xmath12 obeys the first hund s rule thus resulting in formation of the stable local magnetic moment of 2.0 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - polarization energy of such state is @xmath13=0.235 ev , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the total energies of the anti-(afm ) and ferromagnetic states ( fm ) , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , otherwise than magnetism occurs due to the partially filled @xmath2 shell instead of the @xmath7 or @xmath8 shells , pb@xmath1 works exactly as the magnetic impurity . </S>",
    "<S> it demonstrates the high on - site spin stability , its @xmath2 electrons are localized on impurity site showing a weak perturbation with the host ( an interaction with the host occurs through pb@xmath1:@xmath16 electrons ) and in addition , the interstitial defect is almost non - invasive to the electronic and crystal structures of the host . </S>",
    "<S> we have established that any impurity of the @xmath17 outer shell embedded as the interstitial defect into the @xmath0-pbo crystal structure would act as magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-shell occupation , @xmath18 , can be used to control the spin ordering between impurities and also to tune the local magnetic moments : @xmath19 works for 2.0 @xmath5 , while @xmath20 or @xmath21 for 1.0 @xmath5 . from the technological point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the layered crystal structure of @xmath0-pbo promises the superior advantages in achievement of the magnetic percolation and more importantly , a practical way for its control : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ the crystal structure of pbo type grows in polycrystalline form whose large surface area offers enormous potential for doping ( on surface the impurities can be placed on the nearest - neighbours ) ; _ ii ) _ the dopant solubility and long - range order interactions can be manipulated with the impurity atomic radius ; _ iii ) _ any compounds of the tetragonal pbo type can be used as a semiconductor matrix .    in our study </S>",
    "<S> we applied the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with the pbe parametrization @xcite provided by wien2k package for the density functional calculations @xcite . the supercell approach ( @xmath22=7 ) with sufficiently large supercell of 108-atom size ( 3@xmath233@xmath233 array of the primitive unit cells ) for single impurity and of 160-atom size ( 5@xmath234@xmath232 ) for two interacting impurities have been used . </S>",
    "<S> the pb:@xmath24 and o:@xmath25 electrons have been treated as the valence electrons . for integration of the brillouin - zone , </S>",
    "<S> the monkhorst - pack scheme using a ( 5@xmath235@xmath234 ) k - mesh was applied . </S>",
    "<S> the localization of the impurity wavefunction has been additionally examined with hf applied directly to the unpaired electrons that allows to preserve accuracy provided by dft but in the same time to correct the unpaired electrons self - interaction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonal lead oxide @xmath0-pbo possesses the layered structure leading to formation of platelets upon compound growth and each platelets is considered as a single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the layers within such crystal are held together by the interlayer interaction of pb:@xmath16 electrons @xcite . in terms of electronic properties , </S>",
    "<S> these interactions induce a deeping of the conduction band at @xmath26 point @xcite and the gap shrinks as interactions enhance . </S>",
    "<S> gga tends to overestimate the interlayer separation in the layered structures but in the same time it also well known to underestimate the band gap size . for @xmath0-pbo system it results in compensation effect @xcite : for the lattice parameters optimized with gga the band gap is only slightly underestimated as 1.8 ev against the experimental value of 1.9 ev @xcite ( application of the experimental value of the lattice parameters causes the band gap to shrink by 0.22 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correct band gap size is important in investigation of the magnetic impurities : when the band gap size is underestimated the hole - carrying impurity orbital occurs closer to the the host conduction band in turn forcing a delocalization of the defect tails . in order to avoid the spurious long - range order interactions @xcite all band structure calculations have been performed for the lattice parameters optimized with gga . </S>",
    "<S> however , since an incorporation of the interstitial becomes easier as interlayer distance increases , the interlayer distance has also crucial impact on the defect formation energy . in order to make correct evaluation of the formation energy , the experimental value of the lattice parameters has been applied for those calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the interstitial defects have never been considered in origin of d@xmath4 magnetism because they do not belong to a class of most common defects in crystalline materials as they induce a significant perturbation of the host lattice resulting in their large formation energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the layered structure of @xmath0-pbo is different , as it allows the foreign atoms to squeeze between layers inducing a minimal lattice deformation to the host immediate neighborhood ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the formation energy of pb@xmath1 is not too high . for the pb rich conditions / vacuum the neutral charge state </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by the formation energy of 1.23 ev ( for methods see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the band diagram and the density of states ( dos ) for @xmath0-pbo containing pb@xmath1 are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the pb interstitial makes a bond with pb atom from the host generating the defect state inside the band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the defect - induced spin - up and spin - down bands ( 1@xmath27 and 1@xmath28 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) both show dominant pb@xmath1:@xmath29 character but demonstrate a different behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - up band is filled with two electrons and appears just above the midgap at 0.99 ev + @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is a top of the valence band ( vb ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the spin - down band ( 1@xmath28 ) is unoccupied and appears at the edge of the conduction band ( cb ) . in order to understand an asymmetry in filling of the spin - up and spin - down states , bonding of pb@xmath1 with the host lattice has to be considered .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) the pb interstitial in the layered crystal structure of @xmath0-pbo ( b ) band diagram : @xmath31 and @xmath32 are for the defect induced bands , while @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the antibonding orbitals of the pb@xmath1-pb bond . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) total and partial density of states for pb@xmath1 and host pb atoms ( top is referred to pb atom forming the pb@xmath1-pb bond , while bottom for pb atoms in the bottom layer ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bonding and antibonding in panels b and c are reffered to the pb@xmath1-pb bond . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the integration of the pb interstitial into the crystal lattice requires excitation of its ground state @xmath11 to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the pb@xmath1:@xmath36 and pb@xmath1:@xmath37 electrons participate in bond formation with the pb atom from the host which shares its pb:@xmath16 electrons ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bonding orbital appears inside vb , while the antibonding forms the cb bottom ( see @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands and notations of bonding and antibonding at b and c panels to dos ) . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the pb@xmath1-pb bond is fairly short , 2.9  , that is indicative of a double bond formation . </S>",
    "<S> an out - of - plane displacement of 0.54   occurs for the pb atom involved in bonding . because participation of the host pb:@xmath16 orbitals in bonding interferes with interlayer interactions , it alters a behavior of the conduction bands near the cb top : </S>",
    "<S> in analogy with the band behavior in a single layer @xcite , the band deeping at the @xmath26 point is suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , out of three pb@xmath1:@xmath38 electrons found in the excited state ( @xmath35 ) , only one pb@xmath1:@xmath37 participates in bonding while the two others pb@xmath1:@xmath29 are left at the defect site . </S>",
    "<S> the hund s rule dictates both unpaired electrons to occupy the @xmath31 spin - up band . </S>",
    "<S> the empty @xmath32 spin - down band is pushed up to cb that causes considerably large spin - exchange splitting of order 0.523 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetically ordered pb@xmath1:@xmath29 electrons generate the local magnetic moment of 2.0 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in total energy between the afm and fm states is found to be @xmath39=0.235 ev thus promising the fm state to be stable well above the room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> an application of the hf approach to the unpaired electrons induces further stabilization of the fm state to @xmath40=0.490 ev due to stronger on - site localization of the impurity wave function ( the @xmath31 orbital is shifted towards the valence band by 0.5 ev thus enhancing the splitting of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 orbitals ) . on the other hand , reduction of the interlayer distance ( </S>",
    "<S> the experimental lattice parameters are applied ) in opposite causes delocalization of the wave function due to stronger hybridization of impurity state with the host lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 electronic configuration is a key point for the pb interstitial to act as a magnetic impurity : filled @xmath41 outer shell is required for bonding with the host lattice while partially filled @xmath2 shell contributes in development of the local magnetic moment . following this principle , other chemical elements possessing @xmath17 outer shell </S>",
    "<S> can be applied to induce @xmath9 magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , several examined impurities have shown a formation of the local magnetic moment , impurity of @xmath20 or @xmath21 induces the local magnetic moments of 1 @xmath5 , while @xmath19 produces 2 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the spin - polarized state is observed to grow substantially with reduction of the impurity atomic radius .    </S>",
    "<S> our studies of localization of the electron density at the defect site has revealed a duality in its behavior . since occupied band @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> is located deep inside the band gap , the pb@xmath1:@xmath42 electrons shows strong localization on the defect site thus allowing to form the stable local magnetic moment of 2@xmath5 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the long defect tails appear as well but due to bonding / hybridization of the pb@xmath1:@xmath36 and pb@xmath1:@xmath37 electrons from the pb interstitial and pb:@xmath43 and pb:@xmath44 , o:@xmath45 electrons from the host ( see partial dos in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1 ] ( c ) ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the electron density around the defect site is spin - polarized showing an anisotropy in its distribution : the defect tails are symmetrically polarized relative to pb@xmath1 thus contributing in stabilization of the ferromagnetic state .     </S>",
    "<S> schematic band diagrams demonstrate a formation of fm ( pb@xmath1 ) and afm ( pb@xmath1-@xmath46 pair ) states . </S>",
    "<S> the energy values are appearance of the defect levels relative to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density map is plotted for isovalues of @xmath470.005 e / @xmath48 with help of xcrysden . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) fm state at the pb@xmath1 site . </S>",
    "<S> the density map demonstrates the spin density calculated for the energy range ( 1.0 ev+@xmath30)@xmath470.15 ev . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) an interaction of pb@xmath1 with @xmath46 destroys the fm state at the pb@xmath1 site . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density is plotted for the energy range ( 0.9 ev+@xmath30)@xmath470.4 ev . ]    </S>",
    "<S> since extension of the wave function tails to the host lattice seems to be of the long - range order , it is expected to induce effective defect - defect interactions . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated an interaction of pb@xmath1 with the o vacancy ( @xmath46 ) which formation is also favored at the pb - rich / o - poor limit ( oxygen deficiency ) . in its charge </S>",
    "<S> neutral state , @xmath46 is occupied by two electrons showing the strong localization at the vacancy site @xcite . since the virtual hopping is allowed between the states formed by pb@xmath1 and @xmath46 , they can work as compensating centers to each other . for the defects appearing at the nearest - neighbour sites , </S>",
    "<S> the fm ordering of the localized spins at pb@xmath1 is found to be destroyed due to the strong interaction between defects to be accompanied by hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> the pb@xmath1:@xmath29 electrons from the interstitial and the pb:@xmath43 and pb:@xmath44 and o:@xmath45 electrons from the host lattice , all have been found to contribute equally in formation of both defect states ( see manifestation of the electron density in the inter - defect region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strong interactions between defects contribute in lowering of the formation energy of defect pair by 0.84 ev in comparison to the non - interacting defects . with defect separation the electronic interactions </S>",
    "<S> are suppressed leading to recovery of the fm state : for distance of 6.2   between the defects the local magnetic moment is 1.8 @xmath5 . however , because interaction of pb@xmath1 with @xmath46 do not vanish completely , the magnitude of the spin polarization energy is found to be considerably low @xmath39=0.06 ev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the electronic interactions between pb@xmath1 and @xmath46 demonstrate the long - range order due to the long tails of the pb@xmath1 interstitial .    for two interacting interstitial defects , </S>",
    "<S> as both defects contribute with their tails into the long - range order interactions , the magnetic coupling between them is expected to sustain over the larger distance . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath42 state is exactly half filled and , therefore , for two interacting impurities the virtual hopping is allowed only in the afm state making it the ground state @xcite . for two pb interstitials placed on distance 4.1   we found that @xmath49=-0.96 ev while for distance 12.5   it drops down to -0.0056 ev . for the c interstitial </S>",
    "<S> the interactions are lower as @xmath49=-0.38 ev for distance 4.1   and @xmath49=-0.0023 ev for 12.5  . </S>",
    "<S> an application of hf for the localized electrons suppresses @xmath49 almost twice . the afm interaction between impurities </S>",
    "<S> can be switched to fm for the impurity of @xmath50 occupation of outer shell ( for example , in or ga work for fm state ) or for @xmath51 occupation by choosing the charged state ( 1 + ) .    in terms of the formation energies of the interstitials </S>",
    "<S> , it drastically drops down as the atomic radius decreases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the formation energy of the pb interstitial is 1.23 ev for the pb - rich / vacuum conditions , it is reduced almost to zero for ge , si impurities and already turns to be negative for the c and o impurity ( the formation energy of the o interstital is -0.26 ev ) thus implying the higher solubility limit with prospects of spontaneous defect appearance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is found that suppression in the magnetic coupling between impurities to occur with reduction of its atomic radius is compensated by simultaneous shift of the impurity solubility limit to the higher defect concentration . for defects appearing on surface , the defect concentration can reach a number of sites available for doping ( @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 ) as the formation energy is reduced further down ( for example for the pb interstitial it drops down by @xmath52 1.0 ev such as the solubility limit is @xmath55 @xmath54 ) .    in summary , we propose to induce the @xmath2 local orbital magnetism by doping of @xmath0-pbo semiconductor with the non - magnetic impurities to appear in layered structure of @xmath0-pbo as the interstitial defects . to create conditions for partially filled @xmath2 shell to act as @xmath7 or @xmath8 shells of the magnetic ions , i.e. obeying the hund s rule for the on - site ordering of the unpaired electrons , an impurity of specific @xmath17 outer shell is required . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of the outer shell with the pbo crystal structure is unique because it allows doping to be almost non - invasive to the host lattice and its electronic properties . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , bonding between impurity and the host involves only their @xmath41 outer shell electrons thereby preserving the original electronic configuration of the @xmath2 shells . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the partially filled @xmath18-shell of impurity generates the localized spins on - site of defect . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of the defect - induced magnetism over the diluted magnetic semiconductors is duality in its state localization . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath2-localized state formed on site of the pb interstitial has the localized nature to form the stable local magnetic moment , but impurity - host hybridization results in the extended defect tails . </S>",
    "<S> the manifesting long - range order interactions between defects in combination with their high solubility create conditions for magnetic percolation to occur . </S>"
