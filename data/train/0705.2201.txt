    ", the frustrated 2d antiferromagnetic @xmath0@xmath2 model with nearest - neighbour ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbour ( @xmath2 ) bonds has attracted much attention both theoretically ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is now well accepted that the model exhibits two phases displaying semiclassical magnetic long - range order ( lro ) at small and at large @xmath9 , separated by an intermediate quantum paramagnetic phase without magnetic lro in the parameter region @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the ground state ( gs ) for @xmath13 exhibits nel magnetic lro , whereas for @xmath14 it exhibits collinear stripe lro .    in real systems deviations from the ideal 2d @xmath0@xmath2 model such as spin anisotropies  @xcite or",
    "interlayer coupling may be relevant  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a 3d version of the @xmath0@xmath2 model  @xcite has also been considered .",
    "an interesting generalization of the pure @xmath15@xmath9 model has been introduced recently by nersesyan and tsvelik  @xcite .",
    "they consider a spatially anisotropic spin-@xmath3 2d @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model , where the nearest - neighbour bonds have different strengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "this model has been further studied by other groups using the exact diagonalization ( ed ) of small lattice samples of @xmath18 sites  @xcite , and the continuum limit of the model  @xcite .",
    "both groups support the prediction of the resonating valence bond state by nersesyan and tsvelik  @xcite for @xmath19 , and the limit of small interchain coupling extends along a curve nearly coincident with the line where the energy is maximum .",
    "the model has also been studied by moukouri  @xcite using a two - step density - matrix renormalization group approach .",
    "our aim here is to further the study of this model by using the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) . the ccm ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) is one of the most powerful and universally applicable techniques of quantum many - body theory .",
    "it has been applied successfully to calculate with high accuracy the ground- and excited- state properties of many lattice quantum spin systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "a particularly important result from our calculations is the indicated existence of a quantum triple point ( qtp ) at nonzero ( positive ) values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model is a spin-@xmath3 heisenberg model on a square lattice with three kinds of exchange bonds , with strength @xmath0 along the row direction , @xmath1 along the column direction , and @xmath2 along the diagonals , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "all exchanges are assumed positive here , and we set @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is described by @xmath21 where the index @xmath22 labels the @xmath16 ( row ) and @xmath17 ( column ) components of the lattice sites .",
    "this model has two types of classical gs , namely , the nel ( @xmath23 ) state and stripe states ( columnar stripe ( @xmath24 ) and row stripe ( @xmath25 ) ) , the spin orientations of which are shown in figures  [ fig1](b , c , d ) respectively .",
    "there is clearly a symmetry under the interchange of rows and columns , @xmath26 , which implies that we need only consider the range of parameters with @xmath27 .",
    "the ground - state ( gs ) energies of the various classical states are given by @xmath28 we take @xmath5 and @xmath29 . clearly , from ( [ h_classical ] ) , the classical gs is then either the nel state ( if @xmath30 ) or the columnar stripe state ( if @xmath31 ) .",
    "hence , the ( first - order ) classical phase transition between the nel and columnar stripe states occurs at @xmath32 .",
    "the ccm formalism is now briefly described ( and see refs .",
    "@xcite for further details ) . the starting point for the ccm calculation is to select a normalized model state @xmath33 .",
    "it is often convenient to take the classical ground state as the model state for spin systems .",
    "hence our model states are the nel state and the columnar stripe state . in order to treat each site",
    "identically , we perform a mathematical rotation of the local axes of the spins such that all spins in the reference state align along the negative @xmath34-axis .",
    "the schrdinger ground - state ket and bra ccm equations are @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the ccm employs the exponential ansatz , @xmath37e@xmath38 and @xmath39e@xmath40 .",
    "the correlation operator @xmath41 is expressed as @xmath42 and its counterpart is @xmath43 .",
    "the multispin creation operators @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , are written as @xmath46 .",
    "the gs energy is @xmath47 ; and the staggered magnetization @xmath48 in the rotated spin coordinates is @xmath49 .",
    "the ket- and bra - state correlation coefficients @xmath50 are calculated by requiring the expectation value @xmath51 to be a minimum with respect to all parameters @xmath50 such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the ccm formalism is exact if all spin configurations are included in the @xmath41 and @xmath54 operators . in practice , however , truncations are needed . as in much of our previous work",
    "we employ here the localized lsub@xmath55 scheme ,  @xcite in which all possible multi - spin - flip correlations over different locales on the lattice defined by @xmath55 or fewer contiguous lattice sites are retained .",
    "the numbers of such fundamental configurations ( viz . , those that are distinct under the symmetries of the hamiltonian and of the model state @xmath33 ) that are retained for the nel and stripe states of the current model in various lsub@xmath55 approximations are shown in table  [ table_fundconfig ] . in order to solve the corresponding coupled sets of ccm bra- and ket- equations we use parallel computing  @xcite .",

    "in practice one needs to extrapolate the raw lsub@xmath55 data to the @xmath60 limit . based on previous experience",
    "@xcite we use the following empirical scaling laws for the extrapolations of the gs energy per spin , @xmath61 and the staggered magnetization of frustrated models , @xmath62 where the exponent @xmath63 is a fitting parameter . in order to fit to any fitting formula that contains @xmath55 unknown parameters ,",
    "one desirable rule is to have at least ( @xmath64 ) data points ( @xmath64 rule ) to obtain a robust and stable fit . in our results below the lsub@xmath55 results for @xmath65",
    "are extrapolated .",
    "0.2 cm    in figure  [ fig2 ] we show the gs energy per spin as a function of @xmath2 . for each value of @xmath1 two curves are shown , one ( for smaller values of @xmath2 ) using the nel state , and the other ( for larger values of @xmath2 ) using the stripe state as ccm model state .",
    "both sets of curves have the natural termination points  @xcite shown . for @xmath1@xmath66",
    "the two curves for a given value of @xmath1 cross ( or , in the limit , meet ) very smoothly near their maxima , at a value of @xmath2 slightly larger than the classical transition point of @xmath67 .",
    "this behaviour is indicative of a second - order quantum phase transition , by contrast with the first - order classical transition from ( [ h_classical ] ) . for",
    "@xmath68 the curves no longer cross at a physical value ( viz .",
    ", where the calculated staggered magnetization is positive ) , indicating the opening up of an intermediate quantum phase between the semiclassical nel and stripe phases .    in figure  [ fig3](a )",
    "we show the equivalent staggered magnetization , @xmath48 , for the nel state , extrapolated using ( [ extrapo_1 ] ) .",
    "we observe that the extrapolation scheme produces smooth and physically reasonable results , except for a very narrow anomalous `` shoulder '' region near the points where @xmath48 vanishes for @xmath69@xmath1@xmath70 .",
    "this critical regime is undoubtedly difficult to fit with the simple two - term scheme of ( [ extrapo_1 ] ) .",
    "our method for curing this problem and stabilizing the curves is to make efficient use of the information we obtain in ( [ extrapo_1 ] ) to extract the exponent @xmath63 , and then to use that value to infer the next term in the series .",
    "we find , very gratifyingly , that the value for @xmath63 fitted to ( [ extrapo_1 ] ) turns out to be very close to @xmath71 for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 except very close to the critical point .",
    "therefore , we use the form of ( [ extrapo_4 ] ) , @xmath72 the use of ( [ extrapo_4 ] ) now removes the anomalous shoulder , as shown in figure  [ fig3](b ) . henceforth , in all of the results we discuss , we use ( [ extrapo_4 ] ) for the staggered magnetization .    the raw lsub@xmath55 data for @xmath55=\\{2,4,6,8,10 } and @xmath55=\\{6,8,10 } are also extrapolated .",
    "the results for @xmath55=\\{2,4,6,8,10 } and @xmath55=\\{4,6,8,10 } are similar as they both obey the @xmath64 rule as mentioned above .",
    "this adds credence to the validity and stability of our results .",
    "the extrapolated curve for @xmath73 has a very minor `` shoulder '' which is undoubtedly due to using only three data points to fit the three unknown terms , thus violating the @xmath64 rule .    in figure  [ fig4 ]    we show our equivalent results for the staggered magnetization to those in figure  [ fig2 ] for the gs energy .",
    "we note the surprising result that @xmath48 vanishes for both the quantum nel and stripe phases at almost exactly the same critical value of @xmath2 , for a given @xmath1 , so long as @xmath74 .",
    "conversely , for @xmath68 there exists an intermediate region between the critical points at which @xmath75 for these two phases .",
    "the order parameters of both the nel and the stripe phases vanish continuously both below and above the correspondingly indicated quantum triple point ( qtp ) , as is again typical of second - order transitions .",
    "we note , however , that there exists some evidence from such other sources as ed calculations for the @xmath0@xmath2 model ( i.e. , the present model with @xmath76 ) in 2d  @xcite , that the transition between the stripe and intermediate phases is first - order , while others  @xcite have argued it may be close to second - order .",
    "we discuss these points further in sec .  [ discussion ] below .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig5 ]    the zero - temperature phase diagram of the 2d spin-@xmath3 @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model , as obtained from our extrapolated results for both the gs energy and the order parameter .",
    "the phase diagram using the extrapolated lsub@xmath55 results based on @xmath77 is very similar to that of figure  [ fig5 ] , which again adds credence to the validity and stability of our results",
    ".    within the high - order ccm that we have used our results certainly seem to provide clear and consistent evidence for a qtp at @xmath78 for ( @xmath5 )",
    ". for @xmath74 there exist only the nel and stripe phases , with a second - order transition between them .",
    "for @xmath68 there exists an intermediate ( magnetically disordered , i.e. paramagnetic ) quantum phase , which requires further investigation .",
    "although the nature of the intermediate phase is still under discussion , a valence - bond solid phase seems to be the most favoured  @xcite . on the other hand , another possibility for",
    "the paramagnetic phase is the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) phase  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , our most important result is the evidence presented for a qtp for which our best estimate is @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath5 . below this point",
    "we predict a second - order phase transition between the quantum nel and stripe phases , whereas above it these two phases are separated by an intermediate phase .",
    "although the order parameters for the nel and stripe phases vanish on the nel - intermediate and stripe - intermediate phase boundary lines respectively above the qtp , we are unable to conclude more about the nature of the transitions at those boundaries , since the present calculations have not addressed at all the nature of the intermediate phase .",
    "other calculations on this model  @xcite differ predominantly by giving a qtp at @xmath81 for @xmath5 .",
    "we believe that the difference arises essentially from the nature of the alternative methods used .",
    "for example , due to the small size of the lattices used , the ed calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite might miss the longer - range correlations that become increasingly important the nearer one approaches the qtp .",
    "by contrast , at _ any _ level of truncation the ccm always incorporates some long - range correlations through the important exponentiated parametrization of the wave function that lies at the heart of the method , as described in sec .",
    "also , the results of starykh and balents  @xcite are based on analysis of a continuum version of the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model rather than on the discrete lattice model itself .",
    "this could easily account for our differing predictions for the position of the qtp .",
    "as we have discussed above ( and see figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) , our results indicate that there is a continuous ( second - order ) transition below the qtp between the two ordered semiclassical phases with different broken symmetries .",
    "this is undoubtedly a rather novel and surprising result that has few precedents , and one that seemingly violates the landau criterion of symmetry change .",
    "we note , however , that a similar scenario has been discussed recently in the related , but different , context of deconfined quantum criticality , as we explain more fully below .",
    "thus , it has been argued recently by other authors  @xcite that there also exists a continuous ( i.e. , second - order ) phase transition for the spin-1/2 pure @xmath0@xmath2 model on the 2d square lattice ( i.e. , our case with @xmath76 ) between the nel state and what we have called here the intermediate state , and which those authors identify as a paramagnetic valence - bond solid ( vbs ) state .",
    "such direct second - order quantum phase transitions between two states with different broken symmetries , and hence characterized by two seemingly independent order parameters is difficult to understand within the standard ginzburg - landau critical theory , as we now discuss .",
    "thus , the competition between two such distinct kinds of quantum order associated with different broken symmetries would lead generically in the ginzburg - landau scenario to only one of three possibilities : ( i ) a first - order transition between the two states , ( ii ) an intermediate region of co - existence between both phases with both kinds of order present , or ( iii ) a region of intermediate phase with neither of the orders of these two phases present .",
    "a direct second - order transition between states of different broken symmetries is only allowable within the standard ginzburg - landau critical theory if it arises by an accidental fine - tuning of the disparate order parameters to a multicritical point .",
    "thus , for the spin-1/2 pure @xmath0@xmath2 model and its quantum phase transition suggested by senthil _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , it would require the completely accidental coincidence ( or near coincidence ) of the point where the magnetic order parameter ( i.e. , the staggered magnetization ) vanishes for the nel phase with the point where the dimer order parameter vanishes for the vbs phase . since each of these phases has a different broken symmetry ( viz .",
    ", spin - rotation symmetry for the nel phase and the lattice symmetry for the vbs phase ) , one would naively expect both that each transition is described by its own _ independent _ order parameter ( i.e.,the staggered magnetization for the nel phase and the dimer order parameter for the vbs phase ) and that the two transitions should therefore be _ independent _ of each other .",
    "by contrast , the `` deconfined '' type of quantum phase transition postulated by senthil _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite permits direct second - order quantum phase transitions between such states with different forms of broken symmetry . in their scenario",
    "the quantum critical points still separate phases characterized by order parameters of the conventional ( i.e. , in their language , `` confining '' ) kind , but their proposed new critical theory involves fractional degrees of freedom ( viz . , spinons for the spin-1/2 @xmath0@xmath2 model on the 2d square lattice ) that interact via an emergent gauge field .",
    "for the specific example of the spin-1/2 @xmath0@xmath2 model the order parameters of both the nel and vbs phases discussed above are represented in terms of the spinons , which themselves become `` deconfined '' exactly at the critical point . that the spinons are the fundamental constituents of _ both _ order parameters then offers a natural explanation for the direct second - order phase transition between two states of the system that otherwise seem very different on the basis of their broken symmetries .",
    "despite the compelling nature of the arguments posited by senthil _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we should mention , however , that other authors believe the phase transition in the @xmath0@xmath2 model not to be due to a deconfinement of spinons . for example , sirker _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have given arguments , based both on numerical results from series expansion analyses and on spin - wave theory , that the spin-1/2 @xmath0@xmath2 transition is not of the above second - order deconfined type but , in their view , is more likely to be a ( weakly ) first - order transition between the nel phase and a vbs phase with columnar dimerization .",
    "one should also note that other , less radical , mechanisms have also been proposed to explain such second - order phase transitions and their seeming disagreement ( except by accidental fine tuning ) with ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "what seems clearly to be minimally required is that the order parameters of the two phases with different broken symmetry should be related in some way .",
    "thus , a ginzburg - landau - type theory can only be preserved if it contains additional terms in the effective theory that represent interactions between the two order parameters .",
    "for example , just such an effective theory has been proposed for the 2d spin-1/2 @xmath0@xmath2 model on the square lattice by sushkov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and further discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "whether or not the deconfined phase transition theory of senthil _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite survives the controversy that still surrounds it , we note that one of the motivations that led to it was the existence of various other numerical calculations in recent years that also point to a direct second - order quantum phase transition between phases of different broken symmetry that are characterized by seemingly independent order parameters .",
    "examples include the quantum phase transitions between : ( i ) an antiferromagnetic mott insulator and a @xmath82 superconductor in a 2d hubbard model on a square lattice , based on quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations on lattices up to size @xmath83  @xcite ; and ( ii ) superfluid and stripe - order phases in a 2d square - lattice spin-1/2 @xmath84 model with both a nearest - neighbour coupling term ( @xmath85 ) and a four - spin ring exchange term ( @xmath86 ) , based on a qmc method ( viz . , a stochastic series expansion technique ) with lattices up to size @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "while most previous such numerical evidence for continuous ( second - order ) quantum phase transitions between states with different broken symmetry has come from qmc simulations , the well - known `` sign problem '' inherent to qmc techniques has meant that it has not been easy to apply that method to frustrated spin - lattice systems of the type considered here .",
    "we believe that the use of the ccm for such systems , as reported here , opens up a new arena and sheds a new spotlight on this fascinating and still unresolved larger field .    returning to our own results for the spin-1/2 @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model on the 2d square lattice , of course",
    ", one may also argue that what we have observed as a continuous ( second - order ) transition below the qtp may in reality be a very weak first - order transition , which is thereby not in violation of the landau symmetry change criterion .",
    "our completely independent calculations for the two semiclassical phases can , obviously , never entirely preclude this latter possibility .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from our results ( and see figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] ) that the data below the qtp are fully consistent only with a transition which if it is not continuous is _ very _ weakly first - order for _ all _ values @xmath88 below the qtp .",
    "finally , one could also argue that in this same range there might exist a very narrow strip of intermediate quantum - disordered phase , which would then reconcile our results ( at least qualitatively ) with those from the exact diagonalization of small clusters by sindzingre  @xcite .",
    "while this possibility , again , can never be entirely ruled out by any numerical calculation such as ours , we have clearly demonstrated that our own extrapolation schemes are both robust and internally consistent enough to rule out any but an _ extremely _ narrow strip of intermediate disordered phase for @xmath88 .",
    "we end by noting that two of the unique strengths of the ccm are its ability to deal with highly frustrated systems as easily as unfrustrated ones , and its use from the outset of infinite lattices , which leads in turn to its ability to yield accurate phase boundaries even near a possible qtp . our own results for the ground - state energy and staggered magnetization provide a set of independent checks that lead us to believe that we have a self - consistent and coherent description of this extremely challenging system .",
    "we also believe that the present high - order ccm results are among the numerically most accurate for this and related spin - lattice models containing frustration .",
    "nevertheless , our suggested novel phase scenario certainly needs further confirmation by the application of alternative high - order methods .",
    "it would also be of considerable interest to repeat the investigation for the computationally more challenging case of the same system for spin-1 particles , and we intend to report on this system in the future ."
