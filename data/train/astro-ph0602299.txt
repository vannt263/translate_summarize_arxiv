    "recent experiments@xcite have indicated that the flux of cosmic rays entering the earth s atmosphere with energy beyond the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmich ( gzk ) limit@xcite of roughly @xmath1 is much higher than expected . according to the original papers on the subject ,",
    "such ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , presumably consisting of photons , nucleons , or heavier nuclei , must be rapidly attenuated after travelling a distance of @xmath2 mpc through intergalactic space due to interactions such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , and since there are no known sources of uhecr within this radius of the earth the observed flux in our atmosphere should be negligable .",
    "if further experimentation verifies excess in uhecr flux then the simple gzk model may not be the correct theory of uhecr propagation in space .",
    "the excess of uhecr has been known for at least a decade@xcite , but of interest lately is analysis showing significant clustering of uhecr events in the sky in directions that point to candidate sources @xmath5 mpc away@xcite .",
    "the possibility that uhecr are able to travel such long distances through the cmbr lends strong motivation to revise the gzk bound .",
    "the original derivation of the gzk bound for protons depends on the energy of the protons ( e ) , the energy loss per interaction ( @xmath6 ) with a cmbr photon , the number density of cmbr photons ( n ) , and the interaction cross - section ( @xmath7 ) as follows : [ lgzk ] _ gzk = ( ) ( ) for example , for @xmath8 protons incident on cmbr photons giving resonant pion - production we have @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and therefore @xmath11 ( one can derive a similar limit for photons ) .",
    "the dilemma is that no potential uhecr sources , such as active galactic nuclei , are observed to be within that radius of the earth@xcite .",
    "models to resolve the dilemma usually introduce additional assumptions to modify @xmath6 or @xmath7 in ( [ lgzk ] ) , resulting in a larger @xmath12 .",
    "for example , @xmath6 can decrease in theories in which energy conservation fails at high energies @xcite ; @xmath7 decreases in models where the uhecr is initiated by an exotic particle or neutrino which interacts very weakly with the cmbr@xcite .",
    "the current letter proposes that one can extend the gzk bound if uhecr propagate in discrete jumps through space - time , rather than in a continuous path .",
    "it turns out that the form of the second factor in ( [ lgzk ] ) changes , and a jump size as small as a few femtometers is sufficient to resolve the dilemma .",
    "in contrast to the above - metioned theories , this model introduces no new particles or violation of conservation principles , but rests merely on the hypothesis that space - time is discrete .",
    "first let us recall the derivation of the second factor in parenthesis in ( [ lgzk ] ) , the mean free path length for , say , a proton .",
    "this comes about from a pseudo - classical approximation of the proton - cmbr interaction , justified by the relative diffuseness of the cmbr . as shown in figure 1 , from the perspective of the cmbr the proton sweeps out an effective tube in 3-space of cross - sectional area @xmath7 and length @xmath13 ; the probability of interaction with a cmbr photon along this path is just the volume swept out , @xmath14 , divided by the photon number density @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the probability of interaction per unit path length is constant , and its inverse , the mean free path of the proton , is @xmath16 .",
    "= 1.3 pt    ( 90,50)(0,10 ) ( 30,20)(110,20 ) ( 30,40)(110,40 ) ( 30,30)(10,5)(0 ) ( 110,30)(10,5)(0 ) ( 29,30)[c]@xmath7 ( 70,10.5)[c]@xmath13    figure 1 .",
    "_ segment of uhecr path _",
    "now suppose the proton does nt move in a continuous line , but propagates in jumps of size @xmath13 .",
    "working in the same pseudo - classical approximation above , in the course of one jump the proton occupies an approximate volume of @xmath17 in the cmbr , before jumping again . the mean path length ( though this path is traced out over many jumps ) is then @xmath18 .",
    "since the fractional energy lost per interaction remains the same , the gzk bound should be replaced by [ lrgzk ] _",
    "r = ( ) ( ) and depends on the size @xmath13 of the proton jumps .",
    "note that as @xmath19 , @xmath20 becomes @xmath12 , and for @xmath21 @xmath12 replaces @xmath20 .",
    "using again the example of photopion production , with @xmath22 , gives @xmath23 .",
    "remarkably , if uhecr protons jump in intervals as small as a femtometer they can easily traverse the intergalactic space to the nearest uhecr sources @xmath24 mpc away .",
    "supposing uhecr protons do jump in fermi - size steps through intergalactic space , an immediate concern is whether this behaviour applies to other energies and other particles : i.e. few researchers would object to discreteness at the planck - scale , but do existing observations rule out spacetime discreteness at the fermi - scale ? one expects physics of very low energies ( ev- and below ) to be insensitive to motions on the order of a fermi .",
    "however , already in the realm of medium- to high - energies(@xmath25 ) severe constraints may arise in more sensitive environments , e.g. stellar interiors or particle detectors in accelerator - based experiments , though these are not nearly as uniform and diffuse as the cmbr and hence require a more sophistcated treatment than that appearing in this letter .    in the event",
    ", however , in which the discretization of space is a dynamic phenomenon depending on energy ( and possibly other quantum numbers ) these phenomenological constraints may be weakened or removed , and investigations in this direction are underway@xcite ."
