    "the great interest generated by the production of graphene , in 2004 , has led to a search for graphene analogues that share its advantages , such as high electronic mobility , but not its shortcomings , such as the lack of an electronic band gap.@xcite many of the new two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals investigated are obtained from layered materials which , similarly to graphene , can be mechanically exfoliated to obtain samples with few or single layers .",

    "there is already a growing literature dealing with basic properties of phosphorene , as well as studies of possible technological applications.@xcite a series of recent studies have obtained the electronic dispersion using approaches such as first principles calculations@xcite , tight - binding model @xcite , @xmath6 methods@xcite , and a long - wavelength approximation @xcite .",
    "following the example of graphene nanoribbons@xcite , one can expect that the electronic spectrum and the transport properties of narrow phosphorene ribbons can be significantly distinct from the case of an infinite sample .",
    "recent studies of bpns have been based on a tight - binding approach@xcite and via first - principles simulations@xcite that , while giving reasonably precise results for small structures , can become computationally expensive for larger structures .",
    "in addition , pure computational approaches are not appropriate to give physical insights into the basic mechanisms behind the results , which is of fundamental importance for a pure theoretical understanding .",
    "therefore , in this work we investigate the electronic dispersion of phosphorene nanoribbons within the context of a continuum model based on the long - wavelength bp hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we obtain the boundary conditions that describe the behaviour of the envelope functions of the system and consider the effect of different edges ( i.e. zigzag and armchair ) on the spectrum .",

    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) that : ( i ) @xmath174 clearly has a different behaviour for the two different types of edges discussed ; ( ii ) for large values of @xmath0 , the energy gap of zzbpns scales as @xmath175 , whereas the armchair ones follows a @xmath176 relation ; ( iii ) a consequence of the larger band gap for zzbpns , as compared with the acbpns for the same ribbon width , is a quantum confinement effect in zzbpns that is more pronounced than in acbpns ; ( iv ) the analytical estimate is in agreement with the tight - binding calculations , specially for large ribbon widths where the continuum approximation describes with a higher accuracy the charge carriers in bpns .",
    "the scaling laws observed in the results can be understood as a relativistic - like and nonrelativistic - like character for electrons and holes in acbpns and zzbpns , respectively .",

    "in summary , we have studied the electronic properties of single layer black phosphorene nanoribbons by using a recent proposed two - band hamiltonian in the long - wavelength limit . within the continuum approximation",
    ", we derived the appropriate boundary conditions to describe zigzag and armchair edges by taking advantage of the sublattice symmetry that couples the sublattices belonging to different sublayers , i.e. @xmath63 and @xmath64 , being @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) in the same ( top ) sublayer . to the analytical results",
    "were compared with those obtained via a five hopping - parameters tight - binding model , showing that both approaches may provide similar results in a given wavelength range .",
    "we estimated the wavelength range of validity of the analytical edge states and showed to be in the same experimental order as obtained in semiconductor measurements , while for the bulk states this limit is much higher , improving for larger ribbon width .",
    "we have also shown that the surface states of zigzag bpns emerge naturally in this analytical model as a consequence of the proposed boundary conditions and that they can be confined along the both or just one zigzag edges , whereas armchair bpns have no surface states .",
    "for the first time , we analytically computed the energy band gaps of bpns for both edges , i.e. zigzag and armchair edges .",
    "we demonstrated that the energy gap scales differently depending on the edge type , obeying a @xmath175 ( @xmath177 ) tendency for zigzag ( armchair ) bpns .",
    "the analytical analysis developed along the present paper shows the possibility to use the continuum approximation to obtain accurate and relevant quantitative results especially for large phosphorene systems , which would be computationally expensive if performed using the tight - binding model .",
