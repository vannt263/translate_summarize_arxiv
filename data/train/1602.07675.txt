    "several combinatorial optimization problems concern finding means to distinguish the vertices of a graph .",

    ", when each vertex is uniquely identified from the solution of the optimization problem , or _ local _ , when for every edge @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath3 can be distinguished each other from the solution of the optimization problem .",
    "usually the solution restricted to the closed neighborhood of a vertex is used for that identification , although open neighborhood can be used as well .",
    "most of these problems are coloring problems . on the side of global identification problems",
    "we can mention _ identification code problem _ @xcite and _ recognizable coloring of graphs _ @xcite . on the side of local ones , _ locally identifying coloring of graphs _",
    "@xcite and several problems where open neighborhood is used for identification : _ vertex coloring by sums _ , _ products _ and _ multisets _ among others @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address one of these problems , specifically the vertex coloring by sums , which is also called _ additive coloring problem _ or _",

    "the problem as well as the conjecture has recently gained interest from the scientific community @xcite . however , the additive chromatic number is known for very few families of graphs .",

    "let @xmath29 $ ] be a labeling of the vertices of @xmath5 and @xmath30 be the sum of labels over a set @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "a labeling @xmath33 is a _ @xmath4-coloring _ if @xmath34 for all edges @xmath7 .",

    "the _ chromatic number _",
    "_ additive chromatic number _ ) of @xmath5 is defined as the least number @xmath4 for which @xmath5 has a @xmath4-coloring ( resp .",
    "additive @xmath4-coloring ) @xmath33 , and is denoted by @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) . the graph coloring problem ( gcp ) and additive coloring problem ( acp ) consist of finding such numbers and both are -hard problems ( see @xcite for the last one ) .",
    "gcp and acp share some immediate properties . in both problems",
    "one can be restricted to work with connected graphs since the ( additive ) chromatic number of a graph with several connected components is the maximum of the ( additive ) chromatic numbers of those components . also , if a graph has a ( additive ) @xmath4-coloring it also has ( additive ) @xmath35-coloring . in addition , ( additive ) 1-colorings are easily characterizable :    [ additive1 ] for a given graph @xmath16 , @xmath36 if and only if @xmath37 for all @xmath7 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath38 is a subgraph of @xmath5 , we have @xmath39 but the same property does not hold for acp .",
    "for instance , @xmath40 but @xmath41 . and , for graphs",
    "@xmath5 with maximum degree @xmath42 , the best known upper bound of @xmath8 is @xmath43 @xcite , as opposed to brooks result for gcp ( @xmath44 ) which is significantly better .",
    "constant upper bounds of the additive chromatic number are known for some families of graphs : if @xmath5 is a tree , @xmath45 ; if @xmath5 is planar bipartite , @xmath46 @xcite ; if @xmath5 is planar , @xmath47 @xcite and if @xmath5 is planar of girth at least 26 , @xmath46 @xcite",
    ". other upper bounds can be consulted in @xcite .    regarding lower bounds of @xmath8 ,",
    "one of them can be computed as follows . if @xmath5 has _",
    "true twins _ vertices @xmath13 and @xmath3 ( @xmath48 = n[v]$ ] ) , then an additive coloring @xmath33 of @xmath5 must satisfy @xmath34 .",
    "therefore :    [ lowerboundtwins ] let @xmath49 such that any @xmath50 are true twins of @xmath5 .",
    "then , @xmath51 .",
    "the given formula can be applied to prove that @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "+ when a graph has an additive coloring , an acyclic orientation of this graph arises .",
    "in fact , one can obtain the additive chromatic number of a graph by exploring their acyclic orientations and solving , for each one , a problem called _ topological additive numbering _",
    "( tan ) @xcite .",
    "we introduce more definitions in order to explain this approach .",
    "let @xmath24 be a directed acyclic graph and @xmath53 be the undirected underlying graph of @xmath54 .",
    "we say that @xmath54 _ represents an acyclic orientation _ of @xmath5 if @xmath53 is isomorphic to @xmath5 .",

    "the _ topological additive number _ of @xmath54 , denoted by @xmath58 , is defined as the least number @xmath4 for which @xmath54 has a topological additive @xmath4-numbering , or @xmath59 in case that such @xmath4 does not exist ( knowing this parameter is -hard @xcite ) .",
    "now , the following relationship becomes apparent : @xmath60 we can take advantage of properties known for tan .",
    "for instance , the following result provides a lower bound of @xmath58 and , therefore , @xmath8 :    @xcite let @xmath61 be a directed acyclic graph such that its vertices are ordered so that @xmath57 implies @xmath62 . if @xmath63 is a clique of @xmath53 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 are the smallest and largest vertices of @xmath63 respectively , then @xmath66    [ cotainf ] let @xmath5 be a graph and @xmath63 be a clique of @xmath5 . if @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the degrees of the vertices of @xmath63 with smallest and largest degree respectively , then @xmath69    the latter bound can be relaxed by considering @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "hence , @xmath72 , which is a lower bound previously proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ as we mentioned before , one of the reasons to study acp is that this problem and gcp seem to be related as follows :    * additive coloring conjecture . *",
    "@xcite for every graph @xmath5 , @xmath9 .",
    "it is known that the conjecture holds for trees @xcite and , recently , for non - bipartite planar graphs of girth at least 26 @xcite .",
    "our contribution in this work is to give the exact value of the additive chromatic number of several families of graphs and expand the number of cases in which the conjecture is satisfied .",
    "in addition , we propose an integer programming formulation for acp which is used for checking the conjecture over all connected graphs up to 10 vertices .",
    "as far as we know , the conjecture has not been proved for bipartite graphs yet .",
    "we show that the conjecture holds for a subclass of bipartite graphs including regular ones , when its vertices have the same degree .",
