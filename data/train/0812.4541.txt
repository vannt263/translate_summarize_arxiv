    "one of the keys to understanding the structure and evolution of the milky way is the ability to divide its stars and clusters into separate galactic populations as first hinted at by @xcite and formally introduced by @xcite . in the early 1950s ,",
    "sandage published the first deep color@xmath4magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the northern galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) m3 and m92 @xcite and discovered the faint sequence of stars similar to the main sequence of population i. it was almost immediately realized that ggcs are ancient compared to the stars in the solar neighborhood .    over the last half century , it has become clear that ggcs are astronomical fossils providing important information on the formation and evolution of the milky way .",
    "one characteristic of ggcs that makes them so valuable is that they are the oldest galactic objects for which reliable ages can be measured .",
    "ggc ages are of great interest to a variety of cosmological and comogonical issues since their _ absolute _ ages place a lower limit on the age of the universe .",
    "unfortunately , absolute age measurements are still compromised by a number of uncertainties , particularly ggc distances and foreground reddenings as well as metallicities , bolometric corrections and some poorly known aspects of the stellar evolution .",
    "relative ages are almost ( although not totally ) free of these effects and can still reveal fundamental information about galaxy formation mechanisms and time scales . for this reason they have become of paramount importance in the context of the study of ggc .    the study of ggc ages has evolved apace with improvements in instrumentation , in our theoretical understanding of stellar evolution and with the advance of computational facilities .",
    "reliable age determination requires deep photometry that reaches at least the main@xmath4sequence turn off ( msto ) , together with a good understanding of the stellar evolution theoretical modeling . during the first half of the 20@xmath8 century ,",
    "the available instrumentation did not allow observations deeper than the horizontal branch of most ggcs . over the past three decades , however , low quantum efficiency non@xmath4linear photographic imaging has given way to digital imaging using high quantum efficiency linear ccds .",
    "this has resulted in ever deeper and more precise cluster cmds , that reached the msto and allowed the application of age dating techniques .",
    "first relative age studies were carried out by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , as representative examples .",
    "however , uncertainties in both the input physics @xcite and the color@xmath4t@xmath9 transformation of the theoretical models into the observational plane @xcite constitute a significant source of errors in the final relative age determination , particularly when ages of clusters with different metallicities are compared . in the last decade , many efforts have been made in ggc relative ages , improving our understanding with each technological or theoretical advance ( e. g. * ? ? ?",

    "relative ages can be estimated to high precision by measuring the position of the msto relative to cmd features that have little or no age dependence @xcite . however , a key aspect of any relative age experiment is having a large homogenous database of globular cluster photometry .",
    "such databases have only recently appeared in the literature but have significantly advanced our understanding of milky way formation and evolution .",
    "the largest dedicated efforts are those of @xcite , a ground - based survey of 35 nearby ggcs @xcite , and @xcite , an analysis of 55 clusters from @xcite s hst snapshot catalog .",
    "these and other recent relative age studies @xcite consistently point towards a scenario in which metal@xmath4poor clusters are largely coeval but metal@xmath4rich clusters show some age dispersion , @xmath51.0 gyr ( rms ) , and a possible age@xmath4metallicity relation .",
    "no correlation between age and galactocentric distance has been conclusively demonstrated .    in this paper",
    ", we present an analysis of a uniform set of hst / acs data for 64 ggcs .",
    "this dataset , previously introduced by @xcite , has produced well - defined cmds for all of the target clusters from the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) to at least @xmath56.5 magnitudes below the msto @xcite .",
    "the determination of ggc ages was a principle goal of the hst / acs survey and exposures times were defined to maximize the s / n ratio at the msto .",
    "this makes the survey an excellent resource for the evaluation of relative ages .    due to the difficulty in determining the position of the mstosequence .",
    "the empirical msto is then the bluest point on the main@xmath4sequence@xmath4to@xmath4subgiant@xmath4branch portion of the cluster s cmd . ] to the high precision required for age studies , many different methods have been developed in previous relative ages works ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a complete discussion ) .",
    "the two most used relative age indicators are those based on the color difference between the msto and the rgb at a given magnitude level ( horizontal method ) , and the magnitude difference between the msto and the zero@xmath4age hbage hb is the position in the cmd where stars in the cluster start burning helium into carbon and oxygen in a helium rich core and hydrogen into helium in a shell . ] ( vertical method ) .",
    "@xcite were pioneers in measuring ggc relative ages making use of the horizontal method .",
    "they essentially derived relative ages comparing the color difference between the msto and the location of a well defined point in the lower rgb , located 2.5 magnitudes brighter than a point in the upper main@xmath4sequence ( ms ) that is 0.05 magnitudes redder than the msto .",
    "however , horizontal method results are sensitive to the assumed value of the mixing length parameter and to the color@xmath4t@xmath9 transformation of the theoretical models into the observational plane . as a result ,",
    "relative ages determined using the horizontal method are model dependent .",
    "potentially , more reliable age indicators are those related to the brightness of the msto , in particular the vertical method .",
    "first surveys of ggc relative ages using the vertical method were carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they measured relative ages from a sample of 26 and 41 ggcs , respectively , collected from the available literature .",
    "later on , @xcite used the brightness difference between the hb and the msto to estimate the ages of 31 ggcs .",
    "nevertheless , accurate determination of the zero@xmath4age hb is delicate , in particular for the clusters at the extreme boundaries of the metallicity distribution , which generally have a red ( or blue ) hb and no rr lyrae stars .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the zero@xmath4age hb luminosity on the cluster metallicity is still controversial .    in this paper",
    ", we use an alternative approach .",
    "our data reaches at least @xmath56.5 magnitudes below the msto , providing a very well defined ms .",
    "this allows , for the first time , the use of relative ms fitting for a large number of clusters . as it will be shown later ,",
    "the relative ms fitting procedure used in this study does essentially the following .",
    "the ms of two clusters , with similar metallicities , are superimposed in the cmd by shifting one of the cluster s mean ridge line in both color and magnitude ( explained in detail in section  [ mrlandmsf ] ) .",
    "this way , any differences between the two cluster s distance and reddening are compensated , and an intrinsic msto magnitude difference is obtained .",
    "this relative msto brightness is then used to derive relative ages .",
    "this allows us to use what is , in essence , an improved version of the traditional vertical method that substitutes the well - defined ms for the contentious zero@xmath4age hb .",
    "we also take the additional step of comparing our observational measures to updated theoretical models .",
    "we have primarily used the most recent state@xmath4of@xmath4art models of @xcite ( hereafter d07 ) , transformed to the observational plane with an empirical color@xmath4t@xmath9 transformation .",
    "however , we also compare our results to the models of @xcite ( hereafter p04 ) , @xcite ( hereafter b94 ) and @xcite ( hereafter g00 ) .",
    "we find that the various theoretical models agree closely on the msto absolute magnitude and color , resulting in negligible model dependence .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ obs ] describes the observations and data reduction pipeline , and section  [ metscale ] presents the globular cluster database .",
    "the mean ridge line fitting and ms@xmath4fitting procedures used in this study are described in section  [ mrlandmsf ] .",
    "the analysis of the uncertainties is presented in section  [ errordet ] .",
    "finally , relative age results and a discussion are presented in sections  [ results ] and [ discussion ] , respectively .",
    "the paper ends with a summary of conclusions ( section  [ conclusions ] ) .",
    "observations were performed with the acs / wfc instrument on board the @xmath10 . a total of 65 ggcs were observed in the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) filters . due to",
    "its high differential reddening , pal 2 is not considered here .",
    "details on the observations , data reduction and photometry are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for most globular clusters , the observation and data reduction pipeline produces @xmath512 magnitudes of precise photometry , extending from nearly the tip of the rgb to several magnitudes below the msto . in general",
    ", the photometry reaches a depth corresponding to an approximate stellar mass of @xmath5 0.2 @xmath15 .",
    "this uniform and deep photometry offers a database of unprecedented quality , opening a window for new data analysis approaches .",
    "in particular , cluster mss are so well defined that it is possible , for the first time , to apply relative ms@xmath4fitting techniques to a large number of clusters within the same database .",
    "the position of the msto depends not only upon age but also upon metallicity .",
    "this effect requires the use of a large and homogeneous metallicity database in order to determine accurate relative ages . to account for this",
    ", we have adopted the metallicities listed in the @xcite catalog over both the @xcite ( hereafter cg ) and the @xcite ( hereafter zw ) metallicity scales .",
    "this catalog is maybe not as precise as a true compilation of metallicities based on high dispersion spectra , but it has the the advantage of being homogeneous . for clusters not listed in @xcite , the original metallicity listed in the zw catalog has been transformed to the cg metallicity scale using the following equation @xcite :    @xmath16_{\\rm cg } = 0.61 + 3.04[fe / h]_{\\rm zw } + 1.981[fe / h]_{\\rm zw}^{2 } + 0.532[fe / h]_{\\rm zw}^{3}\\ ] ]    lyng   7 , e3 , and pal 1 metallicities are not listed in the previous catalogs .",
    "lyng7 and e3 metallicities in the cg scale have been calculated from the zw metallicities of @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for pal 1",
    ", we used the measure of @xcite .",
    "table  [ gcgroups ] presents the list of our target ggcs , grouped by metallicity .",
    "column 3 gives the cluster identity while columns 4 and 5 present the adopted metallicities in the zw and cg scales , respectively .",
    "column 6 lists the galactocentric distance ( @xmath17 , in kpc ) , taken from @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe the general properties of the cluster mean ridge line fitting procedure .",
    "we then use the derived ridge lines to perform relative ms@xmath4fitting between clusters .      in order to determine accurate relative ages for each cluster ,",
    "a precise determination of the ms and rgb mean ridge line is required . with this aim ,",
    "we have created a new software package for the acs program .",
    "it is worth mentioning that mean ridge lines are determined in the observational plane ( @xmath11-@xmath13 , @xmath13 ) instead of ( @xmath11-@xmath13 , @xmath11 ) , as the sgb appears more vertical in the cmd and the following procedure produces more accurate results .",
    "for the rest of the analysis , the ( @xmath11-@xmath13 , @xmath11 ) plane is used .    for each globular cluster",
    ", the mean ridge line is determined in two steps ( figure  [ mrlfittingproc ] ) .",
    "first , color histograms are computed for stars grouped in 0.4 magnitude ( @xmath13 ) wide bins .",
    "the value of 0.4 magnitudes was determined experimentally as a compromise between two effects  the low resolution produced by larger bins and the noisy ridge line produced by smaller bins .",
    "color histograms are constructed along the rgb and ms with a step of 0.04 magnitudes ( a tenth of the bin size ) in f814w .",
    "that is , a moving bin of fixed width ( 0.4 magnitudes ) , with successive steps of 0.04 magnitudes , is used . a preliminary mean ridge line",
    "is then derived with @xmath18 colors set at each histogram s maximum , and the @xmath13 magnitude of the bin center .",
    "once the preliminary mean ridge line has been determined , the fitting process is iterated three more times",
    ". however , we now use @xmath19 histograms . for each @xmath13 value , the tangential angle of the mean ridge line is determined .",
    "this angle is used to rotate the reference system on which the histogram is computed .",
    "the x@xmath4axis of the new reference system is perpendicular to the preliminary mean ridge line at the considered @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "the histogram is then computed perpendicular to the preliminary mean ridge line and considering stars in the new reference system s y@xmath4axis interval [ -0.04 , 0.04 ] .",
    "the histogram s maximum is determined , defining a point of the new mean ridge line in the rotated reference system , ( @xmath20 , 0 ) .",
    "note that this point shows the correction to be applied to the preliminary mean ridge line .",
    "the coordinates of this point are @xmath21 and its location in the original reference system , the cmd , is calculated .",
    "the process is repeated for all the @xmath13 values to derive the revised mean ridge line , which is then smoothed to derive the final mean ridge line .",
    "figure [ mrlexample ] shows some examples of mean ridge line fitting results .",
    "four selected clusters covering the metallicity range are shown .    for clusters with multiple stellar populations , such as ngc 1851 @xcite , ngc 2808 @xcite , m54 @xcite and @xmath22cen @xcite",
    ", the mean ridge line fitting procedure fits the dominant population ( see figure  [ mrlfittingproc ] ) .",
    "the empirical msto is the bluest point on the mean ridge line .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the final mean ridge line consists of a discrete number of points , it is not a continuous line .",
    "for this reason , in order to determine the msto position , a continuous spline has been fitted to the main@xmath4sequence@xmath4to@xmath4subgiant@xmath4branch portion of the final mean ridge line .",
    "its bluest point is then adopted as the empirical msto . as an example",
    ", the position of the msto is marked with an open circle in figure  [ mrlexample ] . in order to increase the precision of the msto position",
    ", the mean ridge lines have been determined ten times for each cluster , with the starting point of the histograms offset in steps of 0.004 magnitudes .",
    "the msto color and apparent magnitude have been determined as the mean of the ten different measurements .",
    "this method provides a consistently defined mean ridge line , minimizing the effects of the binary population and differential reddening ( see section [ errordet ] ) .",
    "additionally , the rotated coordinate system ensures that the best fit is derived around the steeply curved msto and sub giant branch region of the cmd . for high metallicity clusters , in particular ,",
    "the sub giant branch is nearly horizontal and the more commonly used mean ridge line determination method ( drawing an approximate ridge line , rendering the sequence to a nearly vertical line and then taking histograms in small ranges of magnitude ) lacks the resolution around the sub giant branch needed for precise age measurement .",
    "the cmd location of the faint ms of a ggc is independent of its age , but highly dependent upon its metallicity .",
    "for this reason , we have divided the hst / acs sample into six metallicity groups ( see table  [ gcgroups ] ) using the following divisions : [ fe / h ] = -0.3 , -0.8 , 1.1 , -1.3 , -1.5 , -1,8 and -2.3 . for each group , a reference cluster has been chosen : ngc 6304 , ngc 6723 , ngc 6981 , ngc 6681 , ngc 6101 and ngc4590 , respectively .",
    "reference clusters have been selected to have low differential reddening , low field star contamination , and a well defined ms .",
    "using the derived mean ridge lines , we performed ms@xmath4 and rgb@xmath4fitting between each cluster in each metallicity group and the corresponding reference cluster . figure  [ msfexample ] shows examples of the fitting , in which the mean ridge lines of clusters with @xmath23_{\\rm cg } < -1.1 $ ] ( solid lines ) have been shifted in both magnitude and color to fit the reference cluster , ngc 6981 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the fitting was performed in a least squares fashion and taking into account two cmd regions that have little dependence upon cluster age .",
    "the two intervals are [ @xmath24 and [ @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the magnitude of the reference cluster s msto .",
    "these two intervals have been defined making use of d07 theoretical isochrones .",
    "in particular , d07 isochrones with similar metallicity and different ages were superimposed on the same cmd . based on visual inspection , these two particular regions were found to have little dependence upon cluster age , and were adopted as the optimum intervals for the ms fitting procedure .",
    "these regions are shaded in figure [ msfexample ] .",
    "this fitting procedure produces unequivocal results , with no degeneracy between distance modulus and reddening .",
    "the ms@xmath4fitting provides relative msto magnitudes for clusters inside each metallicity group . in order to calculate relative mstos between two consecutive metallicity groups ,",
    "we applied the ms@xmath4fitting technique between the corresponding reference clusters .",
    "this was repeated for every two adjacent metallicity groups , producing a unified sample of relative msto magnitudes for all the analyzed clusters .    in order to compare relative msto measures to model predictions , we had to calculate the _ absolute _ magnitudes of the turnoffs .",
    "as the relative msto magnitudes are known , the msto absolute magnitude is only needed for one cluster .",
    "we chose the well - measured ngc 6752 cluster , adopting a subdwarf - based distance modulus of @xmath27 from @xcite .",
    "we calculate an msto magnitude of @xmath28 for ngc 6752 .",
    "we performed similar calculations using the ngc 0104 and ngc 6397",
    "distance moduli listed in @xcite of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we calculate msto absolute magnitudes of @xmath31 and @xmath32 for ngc 0104 and ngc 6397 , respectively .",
    "as the relative mstos are known , ngc 6752 s msto absolute magnitude can be also derived independently from ngc 0104 and ngc 6397 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ) .",
    "the mean of the three ngc 6752 msto absolute magnitude determinations is @xmath35 and we adopt this as the final msto zeropoint .",
    "we note that any error in the msto magnitude zeropoint would affect _ absolute _ age determination , but not _ relative _ age measurements . for this reason",
    ", the zeropoint uncertainty is not taken into consideration during relative age determination .",
    "using the adopted zeropoint , we calculate msto absolute magnitudes for our entire sample , which are listed in column 4 of table  [ gcages ] .",
    "the listed uncertainties are determined in next section .",
    "several effects must be taken into account when deriving the uncertainty associated with the measured msto magnitudes ( @xmath26 ) . among these",
    ", we address the cluster differential reddening , the binary fraction and total number of cluster stars .",
    "the total number of stars affects the msto magnitude measurements in two ways .",
    "the first one is related to the total number of stars close to the msto that can be used to measure its magnitude : the smaller this number , the more uncertain the msto magnitude will be . on the other hand , a large number of cluster stars implies more severe crowding , and therefore less accurate magnitude measurement . to these uncertainties ,",
    "we need to add the uncertainty from the ms@xmath4fitting and the mean ridge line determination procedure itself .",
    "the final uncertainty associated to the msto magnitude , @xmath36 , is :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the variance due to the differential reddening , @xmath39 due to the binary star population , @xmath40 due to the number of cluster stars , @xmath41 due to the crowding , @xmath42 is the msto s magitude variance from the mean ridge line determination , and @xmath43 from the ms@xmath4fitting method .",
    "it is worth noting that field star contamination does not affect the msto determination .",
    "our fields cover the central region in each cluster and the ratio of cluster stars to field stars is very high .",
    "moreover , as noted above , the mean ridge line fitting method fits the dominant population , ignoring both field stars and blue stragglers .    as it has been described in section  [ mrldet",
    "] , each msto s magnitude has been determined as the mean of the msto s magnitude obtained from ten different mean ridge line fittings .",
    "here we assume that the variance associated with the mean ridge line determination , @xmath42 , is the variance of the previous ten measurements .",
    "typical values of @xmath44 are in the range @xmath50.01 - 0.04 mag .    with the aim of performing an external cross - check for the @xmath42 , the msto s magnitude variance from to the mean ridge line determination , we have considered four clusters having low reddening and a large number of stars ( ngc 0104 , ngc 5024 , ngc 5272 and ngc7089 ) .",
    "these clusters cmds have been randomly divided into 5 partial cmds .",
    "a mean ridge line has been fitted to each partial cmd and its msto s magnitude has been measured . finally , @xmath45 for these five msto s measurements has been computed for each cluster , where @xmath46 is the standard deviation of the five measurements .",
    "results are shown in table  [ sigmamrltest ] .",
    "column 1 shows the cluster s name , column 2 lists @xmath44 and column 3 lists @xmath47 derived in this external cross - check .",
    "it can be seen that the uncertainties obtained here are equivalent to the derived @xmath44 .",
    "this test indicates that the adopted @xmath44 is a good estimation .",
    "for @xmath43 , we adopted the uncertainty calculated by the least squares main sequence fitting procedure .",
    "typical values of @xmath48 are in the interval @xmath50.01 - 0.06 mag .    to estimate the uncertainties induced by differential reddening , binary star population , and total number of cluster stars , as well as by differences between the measured msto and the actual ggc s msto , we generated over 250 synthetic cmds using the iac@xmath4star @xcite synthetic cmd program .",

    "a set of different star formation rates , initial mass functions and metallicity laws are allowed , and binary star content can be computed . the result is a synthetic cmd with a smooth realistic stellar distribution .",

    "10 different cmds were generated .",
    "observational errors were simulated in all the synthetic cmds by applying a gaussian dispersion to the synthetic cmd , with @xmath46 taken from the dispersion of the observed cmd as a function of the magnitude .    using the same mean ridge line fitting method used for the observational data ,",

    "fainter than input ones .",

    "the age dispersion of the old clusters group , the age@xmath4metallicity relation of the young clusters group and the age trend with galactocentric distance are discussed in detail .",
    "figures  [ chaboyermsfmethod ] and [ chaboyermsfmethodzw ] indicate that the mean normalized age of the clusters in the old group is the same for all metallicities .",
    "the relative age dispersion of this group is @xmath50.05 .",
    "if an absolute age of 12.8 gyr ( from the d07 models ) is assumed as the mean age of these clusters , age dispersion would be @xmath50.6 gyr .",
    "we note that if we assume that all sources of uncertainty have been taken into account in the error bars , then at least part of this dispersion must be real .",
    "the average normalized age uncertainty among the clusters in the old group is 0.04 , which is approximately 0.5 gyr . subtracting this quadratically from the observed dispersion",
    ", we find an intrinsic dispersion of 0.03 in relative age for the clusters in the old group . using 12.8 gyr for the age of this group , the intrinsic dispersion is @xmath50.4 gyr",
    ".    these results are consistent with a scenario in which the old group of clusters formed within a fast assembling process of the halo , lasting @xmath50.8 gyr and which should also account for an increasing metallicity towards the center of the galaxy .",
    "this implies that the chemical enrichment of the protogalactic cloud was faster than the assembling timescale .",
    "regarding the nature of such assembling process , it is interesting to note the following .",
    "@xcite estimate the mass and scalelength of the milky way dark matter halo to be @xmath94 m@xmath95 and 170 kpc , respectively .",
    "the free - fall time of a homogeneous sphere of those mass and radius is @xmath96 gyr , similar to the age range we find here for the old clusters . in other words ,",
    "the age dispersion of old globular clusters is not in contradiction with the formation from the colapse of a single protosystem , resembling the model proposed by @xcite . on another side",
    ", the standard @xmath7cdm scenario would predict a general star formation , including star clusters , in protogalaxy building blocks of mass @xmath97 m@xmath95 before reionization @xcite .",
    "these blocks merge together afterwards to form larger galaxies , and would , in principle , be compatible with the old , coeval cluster population that we observe .",
    "more difficult seems to account for the metallicity gradient ( fig .",
    "[ mh_rgc ] ) under this scenario .",
    "a more detailed analysis is necessary , but it is important to note that any successful galaxy formation scenario must account for the existence of a large nubmer of old , coeval globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "clusters in the young group , however , show a clear age@xmath4metallicity relationship , with younger clusters being more metal rich than older ones .",
    "the nature of this  young branch \" can perhaps be better understood by looking at the ggcs associated with known or putative accreted dwarf galaxies : sagittarius , canis major and monoceros .",
    "@xcite discovered the accreted sagittarius dwarf galaxy and its gc system ( terzan 7 , terzan 8 , arp 2 , and m54 ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have since then argued , respectively , that pal 12 and ngc 4147 are part of the extended tidal stream .",

    "however , the nature of these two structures is controversial .",
    "the existence of the canis major dwarf galaxy has been seriously questioned by @xcite . in @xcite , the canis major stellar over@xmath4density has been completely accounted for as the effect of the milky way disk warp ( an ubiquitous property of all massive galaxies ) .",

    "this result suggests a different origin for the old and young groups of clusters .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is a number of clusters , other than the sagittarius , monoceros and canis major s clusters among the young sample .",
    "another interesting question is related to the recent discovery that ggcs are not simple single stellar populations .",
    "the high mass and multiple stellar populations of @xmath22cen has led to speculation that it is the remnant nucleus of an accreted milky way satellite galaxy @xcite .",
    "but @xmath22cen is not a unique case .",
    "ngc 2808 @xcite , ngc 1851 @xcite , ngc 6388 @xcite and ngc 6441 @xcite are four massive clusters hosting multiple stellar populations .",
    "@xcite suggested that ggcs form as the nuclei of dwarf galaxies in the early universe , and are accreted as their host galaxies merge onto larger structures . in this context , these peculiar ggcs would be good candidates to be the remnants of accreted satellites .",
    "multiple population clusters have been also marked in figure  [ agemetallicity]a .",
    "we note that multiple stellar population clusters have broadened mstos and at least a fraction of the stars in these clusters have rather anomalous chemical compositions .",
    "for this reason , we should be hesitant in adopting their relative ages obtained in this study .",
    "a much more detailed analysis is needed for these peculiar clusters . @xcite and @xcite present particularly illuminating discussions of the difficulties in estimating ages for the multiple populations in @xmath22cen and ngc 1851 , respectively .",

    "interestingly , all intermediate@xmath4 and high@xmath4metallicity clusters with @xmath98 kpc fall on the young group of clusters .    in order to characterize the young group s age@xmath4metallicity relation ,",
    "a least squares fit has been performed , and results are also shown in figure  [ agemetallicity]b .",
    "the age@xmath4metallicity relation observed in the young group of clusters can be described by the equation :    @xmath100 + 0.45\\ ] ]    this relation is plotted with a solid line in figure  [ agemetallicity]b .",
    "the dispersion of the clusters relative ages with respect to the previous equation is also 0.05 , and it is also represented in figure  [ agemetallicity]b ( dashed lines ) . following a similar argument as for the old group , if an absolute age of 12.8 gyr is assumed as the mean of the clusters in the old group , the young group s age dispersion with respect to the previous age@xmath4metallicity relation would be @xmath50.6 gyr .",
    "the average normalized age uncertainty among the clusters in the young group is 0.04 , which is approximately 0.5 gyr . subtracting this quadratically from the observed dispersion",
    ", we find an intrinsic dispersion with respect to its age@xmath4metallicity relation of 0.03 in relative age , or @xmath50.4 gyr .    in summary ,",
    "our results are consistent with the clusters of the young group having been formed in a different process spanning an interval of time as long as 0.45 in relative age , or @xmath56 gyr , and resulting in a group of gcs with a clear age@xmath4metallicity relation .",
    "it is very tempting to argue that the origin of this second group of clusters is related to their formation within milky way satellite galaxies that were later accreted .",
    "however , the reason why the age@xmath4metallicity relation of the ggcs associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , as well as monoceros and canis major , is similar to that of the rest of accreted clusters should be investigated .",
    "perhaps all of the young group clusters share the same origin , which would require an association between sagittarius , monoceros and canis major , or alternatively , all dwarf galaxy systems may share a common ( or very similar ) star formation and metal enrichment history , and hence a common age@xmath4metallicity relation , which seems unlikely .      with the aim of analyzing in more detail the observed age trend with galactocentric distance , ggcs in the old and young groups",
    "are considered separately .",
    "figure  [ agemetallicity]c shows normalized ages versus galactocentric distance ( same as figure  [ chaboyermsfmethod ] , lower panel ) , but now clusters in the old group are represented with open circles and clusters in the young group with filled circles . besides , sagittarius , monoceros and canis",
    "major s clusters are shown as encircled points .",
    "it can be seen that if the old group is considered , an age trend with galactocentric distance is not observed .",
    "the age s variance remains constant with the galactocentric distance for this group .",
    "on the other hand if the young group is taken into account , it can be seen that the age s variance increases with galactocentric distance . in order to determine if this variance increase depends either on the galactocentric distance or the metallicity , a three dimensional principal@xmath4component ( pc )",
    "analysis has been done considering the clusters in the young group only .",
    "the obtained eigenvalues are 2.03 , 0.83 and 0.14 .",
    "the first pc , of eigenvalue 2.03 , accounts for 68@xmath101 of the total variance . according to the",
    "commonly used average or eigenvalue - one criterion , only this pc should be retained .",
    "figure  [ pcaresults ] shows the relations between the original data and pcs projected on the two first pcs plane . on the one hand",
    "it can be seen that the first pc is strongly correlated with [ m / h ] and age , but weakly with @xmath102 , while the second pc carries on most of the @xmath102 variance . on another hand",
    "it is clear that young cluster age dispersion can be explained by an age@xmath4metallicity relation and that age is not related to @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , the effect of metallicity on age of clusters in the young group can be eliminated by subtracting the fitted age@xmath4metallicity relation ( equation  [ agezrelation ] ) to the cluster s ages . by doing this , age@xmath4metallicity corrected",
    "ages are obtained .",
    "figure  [ agemetallicity]d shows the same as figure  [ agemetallicity]c , but here age@xmath4metallicity corrected clusters are represented with solid circles .",
    "it can be clearly seen that most of the age dispersion observed in figure  [ agemetallicity]c disappears , and that age is not related to @xmath102    in summary , it can be concluded that a significant part of the age dispersion present in figure  [ agemetallicity]c for @xmath103 kpc and most of that for @xmath104 can be explained by a strong age@xmath4metallicity relation for the clusters of the young group .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our database is biased in distance .",
    "no outer@xmath4halo clusters , with galactocentric distances larger than @xmath520 kpc , have been considered for this study .",
    "so the analysis of the galactic halo s age structure is limited by the galactocentric distance range of the database . given that outer@xmath4halo clusters ( pal 3 , pal 4 , pal 14 , eridanus , am-1 ) have younger ages @xcite , it is possible that our age range might be a lower limit on the actual range .",
    "normalized ages have been derived for a sample of 64 ggcs using the stellar evolution models of d07 and both zw and cg metallicity scales .",
    "we have also performed an analysis using the stellar models of p04 , b94 and g00 .",
    "the result is the most extensive and precise database of normalized ages so far produced .",
    "our results are :    * we find that we are able to measure relative ages to a formal precision of 2 - 7% .",
    "the relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model .",
    "four independent sets of stellar evolution libraries ( d07 , p04 , b94 , g00 ) produce essentially identical results . *",
    "we find that the ggcs fall into two well - defined groups .",
    "the first one represents a population of old clusters that have the same age , a dispersion of 5% in relative age and no age@xmath4metallicity relation .",
    "if we assume an absolute age of 12.8 gyr , the absolute age dispersion of the old clusters is @xmath50.6 gyr .",
    "accounting for the measurement uncertainties , we obtain an intrinsic age dispersion of @xmath50.4 gyr .",
    "the second group of clusters shows a clear age@xmath4metallicity relation , with young clusters being more metal rich than older ones .",
    "also in this case , the intrinsic age dispersion with respect to its age@xmath4metallicity relation is @xmath50.4 gyr . besides , there is no age dispersion@xmath4metallicity relation if we look at the two samples ( old and young ) separately . *",
    "these results are consistent with a scenario in which the formation of the milky way ccg system took place in two phases .",
    "the first one produced clusters with ages within a range of @xmath50.8 gyr . this age range is compatible with the timescale for the collapse of a protogalaxy of the same mass and scalelength as that of the milky way dark matter halo .",
    "in other words , the age dispersion of the old group of globular clusters is not in contradiction with the formation from the colapse of a single protosystem , resembling the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the standard @xmath7cdm scenario would also predict a significant star formation in protogalactic building blocks before reionization , which , after merging , would produce an old , coeval population of globular clusters in a large galaxy like the milky way .",
    "however , to account for the galactocentric metallicity gradient of this group seems difficult in the context of this mechanism .",
    "the second phase spanned a time interval as long as @xmath56 gyr and resulted in a group of ggcs with a clear age@xmath4metallicity relation .",
    "it is very tempting to argue that the origin of this second group of clusters is related to their formation within milky way satellite galaxies that were later accreted .",
    "however , this would not account for the fact that the clusters of this group share the same age@xmath4metallicity relation . *",
    "we find that the increasing dispersion in age with galactocentric distance is explained by the age@xmath4metallicity relation of ggcs . *",
    "these results are independent of the assumed metallicity scale . *",
    "it is worth mentioning that our database is biased by distance .",
    "no outer halo clusters , with galactocentric distances larger than @xmath520 kpc , have been considered .",
    "the analysis of the galactic halo s age structure is therefore limited by the galactocentric distance range of the database .",

    "<S> these results are consistent with the milky way halo having formed in two phases or processes </S>",
    "<S> . the first one would be compatible with a rapid ( @xmath60.8 gyr ) assembling process of the halo , in which the clusters in the old group were formed . </S>",
    "<S> also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarf galaxies that would later merge to build the milky way halo as predicted by @xmath7cdm cosmology . </S>",

    "<S> it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to their formation within milky way satellite galaxies that were later accreted , but the origin of the age@xmath4metallicity relation remains unclear . </S>"
