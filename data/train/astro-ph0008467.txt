    "x - ray observations of radio galaxies are of value for several reasons .",
    "low brightness radio lobes may be thermally confined by the hot , extended atmospheres in elliptical galaxies or clusters of galaxies and x - ray observations can provide the density , temperature and pressure of this gas , thus constraining the pressures of the relativistic gas and magnetic field in a lobe ( e.g. worrall & birkinshaw 2000 ) .",
    "high brightness regions , such as the hot spots in fanaroff - riley class ii ( frii ) radio galaxies , can not be statically confined by thermal pressure and must be expanding and/or advancing away from the nucleus .",
    "if the motion is supersonic , such a feature must be preceded by a bow shock in the surrounding medium .",
    "the effect of bow shocks on the ambient gas may be identifiable in thermal x - ray emission , depending on the run of temperature and density in the post - shock gas ( e.g. clarke , harris & carilli 1997 ) .",
    "thermal x - rays may also be detectable from radio jets and lobes themselves if they entrain and shock surrounding gas ( e.g. de young 1986 ) .",
    "the relativistic particles responsible for the synchrotron radio emission must also radiate through inverse compton scattering of ambient photons ( such as the microwave background and the starlight of the galaxy ) or the synchrotron photons themselves .",
    "this inverse compton radiation is expected to be spread over a wide range of frequencies , including the x - ray band .",
    "detection of both synchrotron and inverse compton radiation provides a direct measurement of the magnetic field in the emitting region ( e.g. harris , carilli & perley 1994 ) , allowing a check on the common assumption of equipartition of energy between cosmic rays and magnetic fields .",
    "lastly , synchrotron x - ray emission may be observable if electrons and/or positrons of sufficiently high energy are present , a finding which would provide important clues about the origin of the relativistic particles in these objects .",
    "for these reasons , we have begun a program of imaging and spectroscopy of radio galaxies with the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "pictor a is the seventh brightest extragalactic radio source in the sky at 408 mhz ( robertson 1973 ) , and the most powerful radio galaxy ( p@xmath7 = 6.7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 w hz@xmath10 for z = 0.035 , q@xmath11 = 0 and h@xmath11 = 50 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ) with z @xmath12 0.04 . the best radio maps ( perley , rser & meisenheimer 1997 , hereafter prm ) reveal two round , diffuse lobes with very much brighter radio hot spots on the sides away from the nucleus , corresponding to an frii classification .",
    "the total angular diameter of the radio emission is about 76 ( 430 kpc ) .",
    "the western hot spot , some 42 ( 240 kpc ) from the nucleus , is a remarkable object , being amongst the brightest of radio hot spots in radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "prm have found a very faint radio jet extending from the compact , flat spectrum ( cf .",
    "jones , mcadam & reynolds 1994 ) nuclear core to the western hot spot . recently ,",
    "vlbi observations ( tingay et al . 2000 ) have revealed a milli arc second- ( pc- ) scale nuclear radio jet which is approximately aligned with the large - scale radio jet .",
    "simkin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have reported an optical continuum extension @xmath2 01 ( 95 pc ) to the w of the nucleus and the direction to this extension is also roughly aligned with the larger scale radio jet .",
    "rser & meisenheimer ( 1987 ) discovered optical emission from the western hot spot .",
    "this emission has a featureless continuum , is strongly polarized and thus of synchrotron origin .",
    "these authors also found a marginal detection of the hot spot at x - ray wavelengths in an einstein ipc observation .",
    "further observations of the hot spot in the infrared have been reported by meisenheimer , yates & rser ( 1997 ) .",
    "the overall spectrum of the western hot spot conforms to a power law with index @xmath13 = 0.74 ( s @xmath14 @xmath15 ) from 327 mhz to @xmath16 10@xmath17 hz , where the spectrum turns down ( see fig .",
    "2i of meisenheimer , yates & rser 1997 ) .",
    "the morphologies of the hot spot are very similar at radio and optical wavelengths , with a bright , compact , leading `` core '' and a fainter , following `` filament '' , which extends @xmath2 15@xmath18 ( 14 kpc ) more or less perpendicular to a line joining the hot spot to the nucleus ( prm ) .",
    "fainter radio emission associated with the hot spot is also seen to the e and ne of the optical and radio filament , the overall angular extent of the radio hot spot being @xmath2 25@xmath18 ( 24 kpc ) .",
    "the radio to optical spectrum of the `` filament '' is somewhat steeper ( @xmath19 = 0.98 ) than that of the bright , compact region ( @xmath19 = 0.87 ) .",
    "optical imaging and polarimetry of the bright part of the hot spot with the hubble space telescope ( thomson , crane & mackay 1995 ) confirms the high polarization ( @xmath20 50% ) and resolves the hot spot into highly polarized `` wisps '' elongated nearly perpendicular to the nucleus - hot spot line .",
    "the nucleus of pictor a has long ( schmidt 1965 ; danziger , fosbury & penston 1977 ) been known for its strong emission - line spectrum , with broad wings to both forbidden and permitted lines .",
    "double - peaked , very broad balmer lines were discovered in 1993/1994 ( halpern & eracleous 1994 ; sulentic et al .",
    "1995 ) ; these double - peaked lines were not present in 1983 .",
    "such line profiles are commonly interpreted as emission from an accretion disk ( e.g. storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "the nucleus of pictor a is a strong x - ray source ; the spatially integrated emission observed with asca has a power - law continuous spectrum and no evidence for an fe k@xmath13 line ( eracleous & halpern 1998 ) .",
    "further observations of the x - ray spectrum of pictor a have been reported recently by padovani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and eracleous , sambruna & mushotzky ( 2000 ) .",
    "we selected pictor a for observation with chandra because of the x - ray emission from the western hot spot , tentatively detected with the einstein ipc and confirmed by us through an inspection of an archival rosat pspc observation .",
    "further , the optical synchrotron emission from the hot spot is of sufficient extent ( @xmath16 15@xmath18 ) to be well resolved by chandra , making this object a prime candidate for the study of high energy processes in the hot spots of powerful radio galaxies .",
    "in addition to the chandra observations , we also report analysis of archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) optical and near uv imaging observations of the western hot spot .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and their reduction while section 3 presents the results . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the orientation of the radio source and the processes responsible for the x - ray emission of the western hot spot and jet . concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "pictor a was observed by the chandra x - ray observatory on jan 18 2000 ( sequence number 700018 , obsid 346 ) using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) spectroscopic array , which provides excellent spatial resolution ( @xmath21 1@xmath18 ) with medium spectroscopic resolution ( @xmath2 130 ev fwhm at 1 kev ) at the aim point on chip s3 ( back illuminated ) . in order to obtain good spatial resolution on the western hot spot while retaining excellent resolution on the nucleus",
    ", the latter was placed about 1@xmath22 from the aim point in the direction towards the s3/s2 chip boundary ( the y direction ) .",
    "the nucleus was thus about 1@xmath22 from the s3/s2 boundary .",
    "the western hot spot was @xmath2 35 from the aim point and also on chip s3 .",
    "the spatial resolution at the nucleus is barely different from the optimal , while that at the hot spot is 12 @xmath8 19 fwhm .",
    "the eastern radio lobe is partly on s3 and partly on s2 ( front illuminated ) . the total integration time ( `` good time intervals '' ) was 26.177 ksecs , taken with the default frame time of 3.2 sec .",
    "there were no flares in the background count rate , which remained constant at 1.4 counts per second over the s3 chip .",
    "the data were processed using version r4cu4upd4.2 of the pipeline software , and we have used the updated gain file acisd1999-09-16gainn0003.fits . the data extraction and analysis",
    "have been performed using version 1.1 of the ciao software and version 11.0 of xspec .    in order to create an x - ray image covering the whole radio source ( shown as fig .",
    "1 ) , it was necessary to remove ccd artifacts that take the form of broad , linear features along the readout direction in chips s2 and s3 .",
    "this was accomplished by first copying a spatial subsection of the level 2 events file and rotating it by -37.6@xmath6 , so that the axis of the s array ran horizontally .",
    "the image was then smoothed with a gaussian with @xmath23 = 10 and the average of the rows computed , including rejection of those pixels in each column which were more than 2@xmath23 from the mean for that column .",
    "the average of the rows was then subtracted from each row .",
    "finally , the image was rotated by + 37.6@xmath6 , so the rows and columns corresponded to the cardinal directions .",
    "this process not only removed most of the linear artifacts , but also the ` streak ' from the very strong nuclear source that results from its readout and much of the differences in background level between the two chips .",
    "to derive the x - ray spectrum of the hot spot , counts were extracted from a rectangular region @xmath24 in extent which includes all of the x - ray emission from the hot spot .",
    "background counts were taken from an area of identical shape offset to the west .",
    "other extraction regions were tried for the background but no significant changes were seen .",
    "we obtain a total of 3413 counts from the hot spot and 125 from the background .",
    "response and auxiliary response files were created using the standard ciao tools .",
    "the source counts were grouped so that each channel has at least 25 counts so that the @xmath25 fitting in xspec is meaningful .",
    "we followed a similar procedure to obtain the x - ray spectrum of the jet .",
    "counts were taken from a rectangular region 103@xmath18 @xmath8 24 that contains the whole jet and minimises background ( the @xmath16 10@xmath18 gap between the nucleus and the eastern end of the jet was excluded ) .",
    "the background was taken from adjacent regions , and no significant difference was found for the jet s spectrum when using different regions for the background .",
    "we obtain a total of 481 counts from the jet and 240 from the background .",
    "the x - ray response of the ccds depends on the location of the source on the chip . to account for this",
    ", the back - illuminated s3 chip has 1024 individual calibration measurements ( 256 per node ) arranged in a @xmath26 grid covering the face of the chip .",
    "this oversamples the variation in the response of the ccd , and a single calibration measurement may be used for a source extending up to @xmath27 pixels ( approximately 32@xmath18 @xmath8 32@xmath18 ) .",
    "the x - ray jet extends 228 pixels ( @xmath28 ) from the nucleus , so we divided it into four sections , each of which has a separate response .",
    "we also note that the jet crosses a ` node boundary ' ( the division between sections of the chip that have different read - out amplifiers ) , and that the response may vary sharply across this boundary . to avoid any problem with this , we also divided the jet at the node boundary so as not to mix events collected by different nodes .",
    "each of the four spectra were grouped to give each channel at least 20 counts so that @xmath25 fitting is valid .",
    "these spectra were fitted simultaneously in xspec with each spectrum having its own background , response and auxiliary response file .",
    "the spectral properties are assumed to be constant along the length of the jet so the parameters in the fit are tied together with the exception of their normalizations .",
    "one drawback of treating the jet in this way is that the individual spectra will have extremely low count rates , and fitting may only be valid over a limited range in energy .",
    "it is also difficult to produce clear figures of the spectral fits since there are four almost coincident data sets . to overcome these problems the entire jet spectrum",
    "may be treated as a single data set , using an ` averaged ' response function that is the photon weighted average of the four individual responses .",
    "we use pi spectra , which are gain corrected , to minimize the effect of collecting photons from two different nodes .",
    "the results we obtain using this technique are equivalent , within the errors , to those obtained through fitting the spectra individually .",
    "six images of the western hot spot were obtained on august 19 , 1995 as part of go program # 5931 ( pi meisenheimer ) , three each in the f300w and f622w broadband filters .",
    "the images in each filter were dithered by several arc seconds in order to improve the effective spatial resolution of the images on the pc chip . however , the lack of duplicate exposures at each pointing , i.e. , no cr - split , and the paucity of sources in the field greatly complicated attempts at alignment of the images . instead , a number of cosmic rays were cleaned from each image by hand , and then the total number of sky - subtracted counts in the hot spot was determined for each frame . after averaging the results for each filter",
    ", the counts were converted to units of flux using the synphot package in iraf .",
    "the derived values , as plotted in fig .",
    "6 , are 30  @xmath29jy and 104  @xmath29jy for the f300w and f622w filters , respectively .",
    "the errors in these values have been estimated at 10% .",
    "a low resolution x - ray image , covering all of the radio emitting regions and with selected vla radio contours ( from prm ) overlaid , is shown in fig . 1 , while a full resolution x - ray image of the nucleus and structure to the west of the nucleus is shown in fig .",
    "the brightest x - ray source is associated with the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "the position of this source , as measured with the chandra aspect system , is within 2@xmath18 of the radio and optical nuclear positions given by prm .",
    "the nucleus is so bright in x - rays that it suffers from strong `` pile up '' , so no useful spatial or spectroscopic information can be obtained from this exposure ; a chandra observation with a shorter frame time is scheduled to obtain a reliable nuclear spectrum .",
    "a linear feature , visible in both figures , extends 19 ( 110 kpc ) westward from the nucleus and is spatially coincident with the faint radio jet ( prm ) ; we shall refer to this feature as the `` x - ray jet '' .",
    "the x - ray jet `` points '' at the western hot spot , which is 42 ( 240 kpc ) from the nucleus . when the nuclear x - ray source is shifted slightly to coincide with the nuclear radio source , the peak of the x - ray emission from the hot spot is within 1@xmath18 of its radio peak .",
    "there is also evidence for faint , diffuse x - ray emission around the nucleus and extending @xmath16 1@xmath22 from it , but more sensitive observations are needed to confirm this component .",
    "faint x - ray emission extends eastwards from the nucleus to the two eastern radio hot spots , 31 and 34 from the nucleus ( fig .",
    "this faint x - ray emission is seen to brighten somewhat within @xmath16 1@xmath22 of these hot spots .",
    "there are also four compact x - ray sources within the brightest radio contour around the eastern hot spots ; none of these x - ray sources coincides with either radio hot spot .",
    "lastly , we point out a faint ( @xmath30 counts above the background ) , compact x - ray source 323@xmath18 e of the nucleus at @xmath13 = 05@xmath31 20@xmath32 20@xmath33.0 , @xmath34 = 45@xmath6 47@xmath22 44@xmath18 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this x - ray source is beyond the eastern radio lobe , but it lies in p.a .",
    "101@xmath6 from the nucleus , a direction which is precisely opposite to the direction to the western hot spot ( p.a .",
    "281@xmath6 ) .",
    "examination of the digital sky survey reveals a faint point source within @xmath16 1@xmath18 of this position , almost at the limit of the serc - j survey ( we estimate @xmath35 ) , and marginally detected in the second epoch southern ( uk schmidt ) survey .",
    "it is unclear whether this compact x - ray source is related to pictor a.        images of the western hot spot at radio ( prm ) , optical ( rser 1989 ; prm ) and x - ray wavelengths with similar resolutions are shown in fig .",
    "3 . as described in the introduction ,",
    "the radio and optical hot spots have a very similar morphology . in a higher resolution ( 045 @xmath8 009 ) radio image ( fig .",
    "19 of prm ) , the bright `` core '' is found to have a sharp leading ( i.e. away from the nucleus ) edge , with a slower decline on the side towards the nucleus . behind this bright region",
    "is a linear feature elongated in p.a .",
    "32@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , referred to as the `` filament '' by rser & meisenheimer ( 1987 ) and the `` plateau '' by prm .",
    "the overall x - ray morphology is remarkably similar to the radio and optical , with both the `` core '' and the `` filament '' detected .",
    "much of the apparent elongation of the brighter part of the `` core '' of the x - ray hot spot ( fig .",
    "3 ) reflects the shape of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "4 compares profiles along the major and minor axes of the hot spot through both the hot spot and the model psf at the location of the hot spot . at half maximum , the hot spot is somewhat wider than the model , but the model psf does not include broadening by imperfections in the aspect solution . in order to assess the reliability of the model psf , we have compared a compact x - ray source ( visible in fig .",
    "1 ) some 152@xmath18 from the nucleus in p.a .",
    "40@xmath6 with the chandra model psf at this location .",
    "the observed profile of this source ( which is at a similar distance from the aim point as the hot spot ) is in good agreement with the model psf , but broader by 02 at the half power point .",
    "this number is similar to the excess broadening of the hot spot over the model psf along its minor axis ( fig .",
    "4 ) , suggesting that the brighter part of the hot spot is unresolved in this direction .",
    "the excess fwhm of the hot spot over the psf along its major axis ( fig .",
    "4 ) is somewhat larger .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that caution is necessary , since other effects ( e.g. the motion of the source on the detector during an observation ) could lead to further broadening compared with the model psf .",
    "the conservative conclusion is that the brightest part of the `` core '' is marginally resolved or unresolved in x - rays .",
    "there are , however , clear indications of structure in the hot spot at lower brightness levels . as in the radio ,",
    "the x - ray core has a sharper edge away from the nucleus than towards it .",
    "a narrow `` ridge '' extends @xmath2 35 ( 3.4 kpc ) in p.a .",
    "108@xmath6 ( the general direction towards the nucleus ) from the hot spot peak . a weaker feature some 6@xmath18 ( 5.7 kpc ) ssw of the core and elongated towards p.a .",
    "279@xmath6 , is seen in both the radio and x - ray images . in conclusion ,",
    "when the small differences in resolution of the x - ray and radio images ( fig .",
    "3 ) are taken into account , the x - ray and radio morphologies are remarkably similar .",
    "this morphological similarity indicates that the x - ray , optical and radio - emitting regions are physically co - spatial and argues that the x - ray emission does not originate from a bow shock ahead of the radio hot spot .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the hot spot has been modelled in various ways .",
    "a hot plasma with solar abundances and in collisional equilibrium ( `` raymond - smith '' model ) provides a poor fit to the data ( table 1 ) and can be ruled out . if the abundances of all elements heavier than helium are allowed to vary , we find that an abundance of @xmath36 10 per cent solar is needed for this thermal model to provide an acceptable description of the data",
    ". however , this model ( table 1 ) requires a hydrogen column well below the galactic value of n@xmath37 = 4.2 @xmath8 10@xmath38 atoms @xmath39 towards pictor a ( heiles & cleary 1979 ) , and is thus implausible .",
    "fixing the column at the galactic value while allowing the abundances to vary leads to a poor fit ( table 1 ) .",
    "further , we shall argue in section 3.2.3 that a thermal model can be excluded on grounds that the required gas density is so high that the radio emission would be faraday depolarized , contrary to observation .",
    "lastly , a power law of photon index @xmath0 = 2.07@xmath40 absorbed by a column density of solar abundance gas n@xmath37 = ( 7.1@xmath41 ) @xmath8 10@xmath38 atoms @xmath39 provides an excellent description of the spectrum ( table 1 , fig . 5 )",
    "this column density is only slightly greater than the galactic column density towards pictor a , suggesting that the interstellar medium of our galaxy is responsible for most of the observed absorption .",
    "the unabsorbed flux and luminosity of the western hot spot in the 2 - 10 kev band are 3.1 @xmath8 10@xmath42 erg @xmath39 s@xmath10 and 1.7 @xmath8 10@xmath43 erg s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we first evaluate the thermal model .",
    "if we assume a representative intrinsic dimension of 1.9 @xmath8 0.9 @xmath8 0.9 kpc ( i.e. 2@xmath18 @xmath8 1@xmath18 @xmath8 1@xmath18 ) , as suggested for the bright `` core '' by the x - ray image ( figs 3 and 4 ) , the required gas density for the best fitting raymond - smith model is n@xmath44 @xmath2 3 @xmath45 . because the x - rays come from the same general region of space as the radio and optical emission ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we may estimate the magnetic field in this putative thermal gas from the synchrotron emission . for an equipartition magnetic field of 4.7 @xmath8 10@xmath46 gauss ( obtained assuming a total cosmic ray energy equal to twice that of the electrons , @xmath13 = 0.74 [ meisenheimer , yates & rser 1997 ] , lower and upper cut - off frequencies 10@xmath47 and 10@xmath17 hz , respectively , and an emitting volume corresponding to the size of the radio core - 760 @xmath8 190 @xmath8 190 pc [ 08 @xmath8 02 @xmath8 02 ] ) , the rotation measure through the hot spot is expected to be @xmath2 6 @xmath8 10@xmath48 rad m@xmath49 .",
    "if the larger volume adopted above for the x - ray source is used to calculate the equipartition field , a value of 1.4 @xmath8 10@xmath46 gauss and a rotation measure through the hot spot of @xmath2 2 @xmath8 10@xmath48 rad m@xmath49 are found .",
    "in contrast , the high polarization observed at 6 cm implies a rotation measure internal to the hot spot @xmath12 900 rad m@xmath49 ( n@xmath44 @xmath12 0.014 @xmath45 ) , a factor of @xmath2 200 lower than required for thermal emission .",
    "if the 20 cm polarization is used , the upper limit on rotation measure and density are an order of magnitude smaller , but the hot spot is not well resolved at this wavelength .",
    "we thus conclude that our upper limit to the gas density renders a thermal model untenable",
    ". this conclusion could be wrong if either a ) the magnetic field has a preferred direction but many reversals ; such a field structure can provide the high observed synchrotron polarization but gives little faraday rotation , or b ) the thermal gas is actually in small , dense clumps with a small covering factor .",
    "we favor neither of these : the field structure of a ) is physically implausible , and it is very improbable that thermal gas of density 3 @xmath45 , let alone the higher density required if the gas is clumped , exists 240 kpc from the pictor a galaxy .",
    "another argument for a low gas density in the hot spot comes from the photoelectrically absorbing column .",
    "most or all of this column comes from gas in our galaxy ; any contribution from other regions is @xmath12 3 @xmath8 10@xmath38 atoms @xmath39 ( table 1 ) . if spread uniformly throughout the hot spot `` core '' of average diameter @xmath16 1 kpc , the density is @xmath12 0.1 @xmath45 ( as long as electrons are not stripped from the k shells of the relevant elements ) , a factor of 30 below the density needed for thermal emission . in summary ,",
    "our finding ( section 3.2.2 ) that a thermal model provides a poor description of the x - ray spectrum , and the upper limits to the gas density from the limits on faraday depolarization and the absorbing column , rule out a thermal model of the x - rays from the hot spot we conclude that the x - rays are non - thermal in origin and discuss relevant models in section 4.2.2 .",
    "the x - ray jet extends 19 ( 110 kpc ) westward from the nucleus in p.a .",
    "281@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "this direction is only 1@xmath6 away from that quoted for the radio jet out to 3@xmath22 ( 170 kpc ) from the nucleus ( prm ) .",
    "such a difference in p.a .",
    "is within the errors of measurement , so we can conclude that the x - ray and radio jets are coincident .",
    "the profile of x - ray emission along the jet , shown in fig .  6 , consists of a number of ` knots ' , the brightest of which is @xmath50 from the nucleus . in section 4.1",
    ", we shall argue that the western radio lobe is the nearer .",
    "the ratio of the x - ray fluxes of the western and eastern jets , using the brightest part of the western jet , is more than a factor of 10 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , suggesting relativistic boosting , as discussed in section 4.3.2 .",
    "we have compared the transverse profiles across the jet with the expected psf .",
    "after deconvolution from the psf , the jet is found to be transversely extended .",
    "the width of the jet varies somewhat along its length , but its typical fwhm = 20 ( 1.9 kpc ) .",
    "we are confident of this transverse extent because : a ) the profile of the compact source 152@xmath18 from the nucleus in p.a .",
    "40@xmath6 agrees well with the expected psf at its location ( section 3.2.1 ) , and b ) the linear feature that results from the ccd readout of the strong nuclear source gives a measure of the 1d psf at the nucleus ; this feature is much narrower than the jet .",
    "these arguments show that the measured jet width is not a result of poor aspect solution or focus .",
    "the jet is so faint in the radio that it is difficult to measure its width .",
    "prm state `` no accurate estimate of the jet s width is possible , but it is clearly not greatly resolved by the 75 beam '' .",
    "thus the upper limit to the radio width is consistent with the x - ray width .      given the low count rate , the background begins to dominate above 2.5 kev .",
    "the same models as used for the hot spot were tried for the jet ( table 2 ) .",
    "the raymond - smith thermal models provide a poor fit to the spectrum , even when the metal abundance is a free parameter .",
    "an absorbed power - law model provides an excellent description of the spectrum of the jet ( fig .",
    "the absorbing column density ( @xmath51 = 5.8@xmath52 @xmath8 10@xmath38 atoms @xmath39 ) and photon index ( @xmath0 = 1.94@xmath3 ) are similar to those found for the hot spot .",
    "again we conclude that most of the absorption occurs in the interstellar medium of our galaxy .",
    "the unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev flux and luminosity of the jet are 2.5 @xmath8 10@xmath53 erg @xmath39 s@xmath10 and 1.4 @xmath8 10@xmath54 erg s@xmath10 , respectively .",

    "various processes , including acceleration in weak shocks , synchrotron losses and effects of tangled fields ( see summary in longair 1994 , ch .",
    "21 ) , have been invoked to account for the difference between the typical index seen in radio sources and the value @xmath13 = 0.5 expected in the canonical model .",
    "hot spots are , of course , associated with two shocks - an internal , mildly relativistic shock in the jet and a non - relativistic bow shock in the intergalactic medium .",
    "both may reasonably be expected to accelerate cosmic rays and the resulting fluxes and energy spectra may differ .    as well as being directly accelerated in shocks , high @xmath61 relativistic electrons may result from a ` proton induced cascade ' initiated by photopion production ( e.g. sikora et al .",
    "1987 ; biermann & strittmatter 1987 ; mannheim & biermann 1989 ; mannheim , krlls & biermann 1991 ) . in this process ,",
    "relativistic proton - photon collisions create @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . the last two decay into relativistic electrons , positrons , neutrinos and antineutrinos ( e.g. biermann & strittmatter 1987 ) .",
    "the process thus provides a supply of synchrotron x- and @xmath61-ray emitting electrons and positrons from high energy protons accelerated by shocks .",
    "mannheim , krlls & biermann ( 1991 ) considered this process for production of synchrotron x - ray emission in radio galaxy hot spots .",
    "their calculations suggest that the proton induced cascade produces x - ray emission about an order of magnitude weaker and with a harder spectrum than is observed for the western hot spot of pictor a. as they note , the predicted luminosity can be increased by increasing the number of relativistic protons or the number of photons ( the latter might occur , for example , if the hot spot is illuminated by a beam of radiation from the galaxy nucleus ) .",
    "this process seems promising and further calculations of the expected x - ray luminosity and spectrum of a proton induced cascade would be worthwhile .",
    "our discussion of the western hot spot has assumed it moves outwards non - relativistically .",
    "while this is established for the population of radio hot spots in general , it is not necessarily true for pictor a. the fact that the western hot spot is on the near side and is much brighter than the eastern hot spots at both radio and x - ray wavelengths raises the possibility of relativistic outflow .",
    "some of the problems with inverse compton models of the hot spot might then be eased ( as they are for the jet ) , but the difference between the radio and x - ray spectral indices remains a difficulty .",
    "this research was supported by nasa through grant nag 81027 and by the graduate school of the university of maryland through a research fellowship to asw .",
    "we are extremely grateful to rick perley for providing the radio images published by prm in numerical form .",
    "we also wish to thank the staff of the chandra science center , especially dan harris and shanil virani , for their help .",
