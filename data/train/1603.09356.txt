    "the @xmath0-cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) scenario , combined with the theory of cosmic inflation , is the successful , concurrent model describing the past and the present of our universe , consistent with a wide range of observations . in this scenario ,",
    "cosmological structures grow out of an extremely uniform density field but with tiny fluctuations that are seeded by the cosmic inflation .",
    "the growth of the cdm density fluctuations and the growth of baryon density fluctuations are not in perfect synchronization , because baryons were tightly coupled to photons before the epoch of recombination and thus their motion was different from the motion of cdm which only reacts to gravity . only after recombination baryons gradually decoupled from photons , and followed the motion of the cdm under gravity .",
    "cosmological observations have verified the @xmath0cdm scenario in scales large enough to make the baryonic physics almost irrelevant ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . however , once in the regime where the baryonic physics becomes important , the growth of baryon fluctuations is affected by hydrodynamics and the growth of the cdm is affected by the gravitational feedback from the baryon fluctuations . some of the usual assumptions that are made for treating very large scales , therefore , should be taken carefully or modified when treating relatively small scales .",
    "for example , @xcite improved on the previous estimation of the linear density power spectrum in small scales , by replacing the usual assumption made in cosmology that the sound speed of baryons is uniform in space with the fact that the sound speed fluctuates in space in small scales .",
    "they showed that more than @xmath1 change occurs in the baryon density power spectrum and even more change in the baryon temperature power spectrum .",
    "a sheer inclusion of the sub - dominant , yet non - negligible baryonic component in the analysis changes the prediction on the matter density power spectrum at a few percent level even in large scales , as was shown in the framework of the high - order perturbation theory @xcite .    similarly , the relative velocity ( `` streaming velocity '' ) between baryons and the cdm after the recombination should also be considered carefully in cosmology .",
    "* th hereafter ) , for the first time , properly calculated the growth of small - scale density fluctuations under the influence of the streaming velocity .",
    "small - scale fluctuations are coupled to large - scale streaming velocity fields which are coherent over a few comoving mpc scale .",
    "this has its own spatial fluctuation with @xmath2km / s standard deviation at the epoch of recombination , and then decays in proportion to the inverse of the scale factor @xmath3 .",
    "its impact on the small - scale structure formation is non - negligible because the streaming velocity remains supersonic ( until the intergalactic medium is strongly heated ) .",
    "this then leads to the suppression of small - scale matter density fluctuations .",
    "the wave - modes that are the most strongly affected are around @xmath4mpc , and the impact is on the matter power spectrum , the conditional mass function and the halo bias parameter , to name a few ( th ) .",
    "subsequent studies have considered the impact of the streaming velocity in the perspective of both cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "the boost of amplitude and the shift of the peak of the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) feature due to the streaming velocity , in the gas intensity mapping or the galaxy survey , were intensively investigated ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they find that both high - redshift ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and low - redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) surveys will be affected .",
    "the impact of the streaming velocity on bao may be separated out from the impact of the matter density itself ( @xcite ) , which is important because otherwise it will become another nuisance parameter in cosmology .",
    "the astrophysical impact of the streaming velocity has been investigated with focus on the formation of the nonlinear structure such as cosmological halos and stellar objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most studies indicate that the formation of minihalos ( roughly in the mass range @xmath5\\ , m_{\\odot}$ ] ) and the formation of stellar objects in them are suppressed .",
    "it may induce baryon - dominated objects such as globular clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the actual star formation process leading to globular clusters has yet to be simulated",
    ". it may be responsible even for the generation of the primordial magnetic field ( @xcite ) . because minihalos are the most strongly affected among cosmological halos and they are responsible for the early phase of the cosmic reionization process , how they change the high - redshift 21-cm background is also of a prime interest ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that some of these numerical simulation results ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which are based on the initial condition generated by the usual boltzmann solver such as the code for anisotropies in the microwave background ( camb : @xcite ) , need to be re - examined .",
    "this is because the impact of the streaming velocity is cumulative and inherent even at @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , at which or later these simulations start with a streaming velocity implemented by hand .",
    "the original formalism by th has been re - investigated in terms of the high - order perturbation theory in the wave - number space ( `` @xmath7-space '' henceforth ) , and some `` missing terms '' previously neglected were found important ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "basically , for the large - scale modes responsible for the streaming velocity ( @xmath8/{\\rm mpc}$ ] ) , th used a trivial solution for the evolution of the streaming velocity ( @xmath9 ) and the density ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 being overdensities of the cdm and baryons in large scale , respectively ) environment : @xmath12 , @xmath13 . treating this as a new 0th - order solution to the perturbation equations",
    ", they then examined how the perturbation in small scales grows . in doing so",
    ", they treated @xmath9 as a spatial quantity and perturbation variables in small scales as @xmath7-space quantities .",
    "this is basically a high - order perturbation theory , coupling large - scale mode ( @xmath9 ) and the small - scale modes ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 , small scale cdm and baryonic overdensities , respectively ) .",
    "however , @xmath9 is tightly linked to the fluctuating @xmath10 and @xmath11 through the density continuity equation , and thus the trivial solution adopted by th can not be used for generically overdense and underdense regions .",
    "the continuity equation connects the divergence of @xmath9 to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xcite finds that the divergence of @xmath9 is indeed an important term that one should not ignore .",
    "@xcite also works on the generic basis of non - zero @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we improve on the formalism of th by also considering the non - zero overdensities . toward this end , different from @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we inherit the original method by th and focus on the impact on small - scale modes : large - scale @xmath9 is treated as the spatial quantity and small - scale overdensities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are treated as the @xmath7-space quantity in the perturbation analysis .",
    "most importantly , we explicitly include generically `` non - zero '' @xmath10 and @xmath11 as a new set of spatial quantities , and consequently the divergence of cdm and baryon velocities as well .",
    "we find that this leads to a set of mode - mode coupling terms , including the velocity divergence - density coupling .",
    "we carefully include all the coupling terms to the leading order in our perturbation analysis .",
    "we also include the baryonic physics , namely fluctuations in the sound speed ( @xcite ) , the gas temperature and the photon temperature .",
    "our formalism is also suitable for generating initial conditions for n - body+hydro numerical simulations . because the new set of mode - mode couplings is imprinted in the initial condition , the initial condition generator considering the streaming - velocity effect by @xcite , cicsass ,",
    "should also be improved on if one were to numerically simulate the structure formation inside overdense or underdense regions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we lay out the basic formalism and describe the statistics of large - scale fluctuations in section [ sec : formalism ] . in section",
    "[ sec : result ] , we show results on the matter density power spectrum , the conditional halo abundance and the halo bias as applications of the formalism .",
    "we conclude this work in section [ sec : discussion ] with a summary , discussion and future prospects .",
    "some details left out in the main body are described in appendices .",
    "we start from a set of equations for perturbations of relevant physical variables .",
    "all the @xmath16 modes of interest are in sub - horizon scale such that the newtonian perturbation theory holds .",
    "let us define the overdensity @xmath17 , where the subscript @xmath18=\\{c ,  b } denotes either the cdm ( c ) or the baryonic ( b ) component , and @xmath19 where @xmath3 is the scale factor and @xmath20 is the proper peculiar velocity of component @xmath18 . when the universe is in the regime where we can ignore fluctuations of photons and neutrinos due to their rapid diffusion after recombination , we have ( e.g. @xcite ; th )    @xmath21    where @xmath3 is the scale factor , @xmath22 is the gradient in the comoving frame , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the present - day mean density of component @xmath18 in the unit of the critical density , @xmath28 is the sound speed , and @xmath29 is the hubble constant at a given redshift . even though a usual approximation for @xmath28 is a spatially uniform one given by    @xmath30    which assumes a mean - density environment undergoing hubble expansion with the mean baryon temperature @xmath31 , for high @xmath16 modes a more accurate treatment is required ( @xcite ) .",
    "this requires replacing the pressure term in equation ( [ eq : mater_pressure ] ) in order to find the correct coupling of high-@xmath7 and low-@xmath7 modes in equations ( [ eq : perturbation_spatial ] ) and ( [ eq : perturbation_k ] ) .",
    "] ,    @xmath32    in equation ( [ eq : master ] ) and considering another rate equation    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are temperature fluctuations of the baryon and the photon , respectively , @xmath36 is the mean photon temperature , @xmath37 is the global electron fraction at time @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for @xmath31",
    ", we use the fitting formula by th .",
    "equation ( [ eq : master ] ) allows a trivial solution : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the initial scale factor .",
    "th took this as the zeroth - order solution of a spatial patch and developed a linear perturbation theory of small scale modes inside the patch .",
    "the physical process is in principle a coupling of small-@xmath7 and large-@xmath7 modes ( mode - mode coupling ) , which is beyond the linear theory where all modes are assumed to be mutually independent .",
    "th used the fact that the relative velocity @xmath44 is coherent over the length scale of a few comoving mpc ( contributed by modes with wave numbers in the range @xmath45 ) , and averaged the `` local '' power spectra of density fluctuations over many such patches with varying @xmath46 .",
    "even though a trivial solution exists , there also exists a nontrivial solution to equation ( [ eq : master ] ) , exact to the first order .",
    "this nontrivial solution is suited to describe the physics inside patches with non - zero overdensity ( see also @xcite ) . in order to obtain the nontrivial solution , we first linearize equation ( [ eq : master ] ) :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the matter content with respect to the critical density @xmath49 at @xmath3 , and we ignored second - order terms and also the pressure term @xmath50 .",
    "this is indeed a valid approximation in the wave number range ( @xmath45 ) relevant to the coherent @xmath46 ( th ) , where the second - order terms remain much smaller than the first - order terms and the baryonic sound speed keeps decreasing from @xmath51km / s after recombination to make the pressure term negligible .",
    "then , equation ( [ eq : background ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . in the matter - dominated ( @xmath57 )",
    "flat universe , @xmath58 allows both the growing mode ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) and the decaying mode ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "@xmath65 allows a slowly decaying ( `` streaming '' ) mode ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and a compensated mode ( @xmath65=constant , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) . during @xmath71 , the non - negligible amount of the radiation component ( cmb and neutrinos )",
    "makes @xmath72 , and most of the simple analytical forms above become no longer intact except for \\{@xmath73 , @xmath74 } of the streaming mode and \\{@xmath65 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 } of the compensated mode .    using this mode decomposition ,",
    "the large - scale perturbations evolve in the following form :    @xmath75    where we used upper - case letters to denote the `` background '' fluctuations for each patch of a few comoving mpc , over which we will develop the small - scale perturbation .",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are the initial ( at @xmath80 ) values of the growing , decaying , compensated , and streaming modes , respectively .",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are growth factors of the growing , decaying , and streaming modes , respectively , and they are all normalized as @xmath84 at @xmath80 .",
    "we describe the details of these modes in appendix a. it is noteworthy , as is well known already , that both cdm and baryonic components tend to approach the same asymptotes @xmath85 and @xmath86 , indicating that baryons tend to move together with cdms in time .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath46 decays as @xmath87 throughout the evolution at any overdensity environment even though @xmath88 and @xmath89 grow roughly as @xmath90 individually ( except in regions with @xmath13 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 decay as @xmath87 ) .",
    "this fact may seem to make the analysis by th valid in generic overdensity environments to some extent : th relied on the trivial solution @xmath13 , in which all velocity components decay in time such that @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and most importantly @xmath93 . because the suppression of the matter - density fluctuations ( @xmath94 ) depends not on individual velocity components but on @xmath46 only , different temporal behavior of individual velocity components among the trivial and generic solutions do not matter .",
    "nevertheless , quantitative prediction by th will be questioned in section [ sub : pk ] , because we use nontrivial solutions ( equation [ eq : background_sol ] ) which result in the new type of coupling of high-@xmath7 and low-@xmath7 modes in general .",
    "we also require the evolution of @xmath95 , which is given by equation ( [ eq : master_temp ] ) :    @xmath96    which is evolved in conjunction with equation ( [ eq : master ] ) . here we neglect @xmath97 term due to its smallness ( see also the following discussion ) , even though we do not neglect @xmath98 when initializing @xmath99 ( section [ sub : numerical ] ) . we have found a useful fitting formula for @xmath100 for patches with volume @xmath101 :    @xmath102\\nonumber \\\\ & & |\\delta_{t,\\ , a}|^{4.2591}|\\delta_{t,\\ , b}|^{-3.2591 } , \\label{eq : deltat_fitting}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which provides a good fit to @xmath95 at @xmath103 , and for higher redshift range we simply ignore @xmath95 altogether because of smallness of @xmath95 in general . here",
    "@xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and an almost complete coupling of @xmath100 to @xmath107 at @xmath108 yields this simple , empirical relation to @xmath107 .",
    "we describe this fitting formula in more details in appendix b. the decoupling of @xmath100 from the cmb is much earlier than the mean value experiences , which occur at @xmath109 , because the larger the @xmath7 is , the earlier the decoupling occurs ( see e.g. figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "including @xmath97 explicitly may delay this decoupling to some extent , but we leave such an accurate calculation to future work . using the evolution equation for @xmath107 in equation ( [ eq : background_sol ] ) , equation ( [ eq : deltat_fitting ] ) is determined solely by local values of the 4 modes .",
    "now we expand equations ( [ eq : master ] ) , ( [ eq : mater_pressure ] ) and ( [ eq : master_temp ] ) to the linear order , taking equation ( [ eq : background_sol ] ) as the zeroth - order solution .",
    "we first define the net density , the net velocity ( of the fluid component @xmath110 ) , the net gravitational potential and the net baryon temperature as @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , respectively . here",

    "secondly , the justification for ignoring @xmath124 is easily seen in viewpoint of the @xmath7-space . with the fourier expansion @xmath125 of a quantity @xmath126 in an actual , real space ( `` @xmath127 space '' henceforth ) ,",

    "the end result is then ensemble - averaged over varying @xmath10 and @xmath46 to obtain @xmath182 ( equation [ eq : pk_average ] ) .",
    "we first examine how the evolution of @xmath188 depends on the density environment , and compare the result to the prediction by th .",

    "afterwards , the bias and the anti - bias are not balanced by more than 1% and such off - balance keeps growing in time .",
    "the higher the @xmath201 is , the earlier this unbalance starts .",
    "thirdly , the fractional deviation from the mean - density case is almost universal regardless of the value of @xmath16 , and thus the timing of the unbalance is approximately a function only of @xmath202 .",
    "finally , in some high-@xmath134 patches , our linear analysis based on equation ( [ eq : perturbation_k ] ) without quadratic and higher - order terms in @xmath135 starts to break down at @xmath203 , because these modes enter the nonlinear regime ( @xmath204 ; see figure [ fig : pk_growth ] ) at this epoch .",
    "a similar breakdown of the formalism will occur for perturbations inside very low-@xmath134 patches as well .",
    "therefore , a higher - order scheme than our work is required when one is to predict the low - redshift evolution of @xmath135 s . on the other hand ,",

    "one can instead put a lower bound @xmath233 ( @xmath234^{1/3}$ ] ) in the integral of equation ( [ eq : sigma2_th ] ) , which would be identical to the reduced variance if a sharp @xmath16-space window function is used .",
    "the global mass function @xmath235 is simply an average of the local mass function , @xmath236 , over the ensemble of patches .",
    "when @xmath236 is averaged only over @xmath9 for a given @xmath134 , which is equivalent to visiting only those patches with the same @xmath134 and taking the average , it leads to the conditional mass function @xmath237 .",
    "this calculation should be modified , because @xmath227 depends also on @xmath134 through the dependence of @xmath238 on @xmath134 :    @xmath239    which will enter equation ( [ eq : cond_mass_ftn ] ) .",
    "here we used the sharp @xmath7-space filter , and thus @xmath240^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "an overdense patch will then have a boost in @xmath236 from the value by th because @xmath241 and thus @xmath242 , and vice versa ( a decrease from the value by th ) for an underdense patch .",
    "obviously , both @xmath243 and @xmath235 will also be affected .",
    "it is important to compare our findings to the usual peak - background split scheme and the one by th . in the `` standard '' scheme ,",

    "therefore , the local , high-@xmath7 modes have a universal as @xmath244 ) . ] variance @xmath245 whether or not they are placed inside a patch with non - zero @xmath134 .",
    "the way how the halo formation is biased in an overdense region is simply through the shift in the density ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "th then realized the fact that the variance is not universal but should depend on @xmath9 . because non - zero @xmath9 tends to suppress @xmath245 , the odds to cross @xmath226 decrease relative to the standard picture .",
    "we find that there is another dependency of the variance , which is @xmath134 .",
    "in other words , we find that there are two biasing effects in an overdense region compared to a mean - density region : getting closer to @xmath226 because of the shift in the density ( @xmath246 , also in the standard scheme ) , and having a larger degree of fluctuation in @xmath187 due to the mode - mode coupling ( e.g. source terms @xmath247 and @xmath248 in @xmath249 in equation [ eq : perturbation_k ] , which is a new finding ) .",
    "therefore , by not fully implementing the effect of non - zero @xmath134 , th in effect underestimates and overestimates the halo mass functions in overdense and underdense regions , respectively .",
    "we note that this additional bias effect should be present even in the standard picture with @xmath250 , because this is due to the natural coupling between the large - scale and small - scale density perturbations . in this case , however , we are not sure about the quantitative validity of the extended press - schechter formalism on the conditional mass function ( equation [ eq : cond_mass_ftn ] ) , which is based on the linear theory guaranteeing gaussianity at any filtering scales _ without _ the mode - mode couplings .",
    "qualitatively , we believe that the boost of local @xmath187 and @xmath245 under @xmath134 should boost the conditional mass function to the level estimated by equations ( [ eq : cond_mass_ftn ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma2_ahn ] ) as described above anyways . we defer a further investigation of this issue , which can be clarified with numerical simulations of the halo formation under different @xmath134 s .",
    "discrepancy between the conditional mass functions by this work and by th is significant if we focus on individual patches .",
    "figure [ fig : cond_mass_ftn ] illustrates how our prediction differs from that by th . for example , at @xmath251 ,",
    "under @xmath252 we predict [ 100 - 2000 ] % boost in @xmath243 compared to the values by th ( let us denote them by @xmath253 ) . for @xmath254",
    ", we predict 90 % or more decrease in @xmath243 compared to the values by th .",
    "this is the obvious result of the mode - mode coupling of @xmath134 and @xmath135 described above .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the discrepancy is the largest for the rarest halos : first , at any redshift , the discrepancy increases as the halo mass increases and secondly , for any given halo mass , the discrepancy decreases in time .",
    "the discrepancy among the conditional mass functions by this work , by th and by the standard picture also influences @xmath235 .",
    "let us just take the example of @xmath255 ( figure [ fig : global_mass_ftn ] ) .",
    "compared to the standard prediction ( @xmath256 ) , conditional mass functions by th stay lower regardless of @xmath134 .",
    "this is due to the suppression of structure formation by the relative velocity .",
    "in contrast , @xmath243 in this work is either higher or lower than the standard prediction ( @xmath257 ) depending on the halo mass and @xmath134 . at @xmath255 , for @xmath254 @xmath258 and for @xmath252 @xmath259 for any halo mass .",
    "the tendency for @xmath243 to overshoot @xmath260 when @xmath261 is not generic , because the influence of the positive @xmath134 s on the structure formation appears only late in its evolution ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : pk_growth ] and [ fig : pk_compare ] ) . at any rate , the contrast in @xmath243 among overdense and underdense regions",
    "is increased compared to th and the standard picture , and the net effect e.g. at @xmath255 is to boost @xmath235 from @xmath262 . at much higher redshifts ,",
    "our @xmath235 is almost indistinguishable from that by th , which undershoots @xmath262 .",
    "we note that @xmath243 and @xmath235 have the usual problem of not correctly predicting the actual mass function , if one sticks to the original extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "minihalos at high redshifts are usually underestimated by the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "the usual peak - background split method suffers from large discrepancies between its prediction and the n - body simulation results for rare halos in general . in this case",
    ", a hybrid method to connect the peak - background - split halo bias parameter to the better - fitting mean mass function types ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) is much more appropriate .",
    "we will apply this method in the future for a better estimation of the conditional mass function and the @xmath263-space halo bias parameter ( section [ sub : halo - bias ] ) .",
    "the conditional mass function we examined in section [ sub : mass_function ] is an indicator of how halo formation is biased toward overdense regions .",
    "the halo bias can be viewed also in the the @xmath7-space .",
    "this is a crucial parameter in cosmology when trying to probe the fluctuation of the matter density from surveys of galaxies through , for example , the power spectrum analysis .",
    "the halo bias parameter in @xmath7-space is defined as    @xmath264    where @xmath265 is the power spectrum of halo over - abundance @xmath266 @xmath267 can then be fourier - transformed in order to calculate @xmath265 .",
    "we expect @xmath268 to be larger than that predicted by th , because the `` contrast '' in @xmath243 between overdense and underdense regions has increased from that by th ( section [ sub : mass_function ] ; figure [ fig : cond_mass_ftn ] ) .",

    "we will increase the size of the box in future work for a better estimation .",
    "] , which is tied to the modulation of the streaming velocity , the density fluctuation , and the baryon fraction in the existence of the compensated mode @xcite .",
    "this makes it difficult to deduce @xmath272 from @xmath265 , not to mention from the galaxy surveys where galaxy formation mechanism , strongly influenced by baryonic physics , is another nuisance parameter ( but see @xcite for how to separate out the streaming velocity effect ) .",
    "for the halo mass range treated in this paper , @xmath268 should modulate the distribution of the first stars which grow predominantly inside minihalos .",
    "as was also noted by th , the difference in @xmath268 should also influence the formation of much larger - mass halos , which are used for galaxy surveys .",
    "it is also possible that the nonlinear effect described by @xcite , or the heating of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) due to the velocity difference between cdm and baryons , is modulated in space depending on the overdensity .",
    "then the power spectrum in the 21-cm background , which may be dominated by the velocity fields if the heating is efficient ( @xcite ) , is likely to be boosted .",
    "because such a power spectrum shows a very clear bao feature and the 21-cm observation usually suffers from the low sensitivity , the signal boosted even more from the prediction by @xcite will be a very promising target for the high - redshift 21-cm cosmology .",
    "let us briefly discuss the halo stochasticity .",
    "the halo stochasticity is defined as    @xmath273    where @xmath274 is the cross power spectrum between the halo density and the matter density . both in th and in this work",
    ", stochasticity is caused by the fluctuation in @xmath243 because patches with the same @xmath134 can have different @xmath9 s which affect @xmath243 .",
    "one should note that the fluctuation should be caused also by the sampling variance .",
    "the conditional mass functions usually show super - poissonian distributions in @xmath243 even in the standard picture with @xmath250 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and obviously this should cause the stochasticity in addition to that by the varying @xmath9 . because we use the `` mean '' conditional mass function",
    "just as th did , in both works @xmath275 does not reflect the sampling variance . including this effect",
    "requires the calculation of the sub - cell correlation function ( @xcite ) , which we delay to future work .",
    "we investigated the impact of the relative velocity ( streaming velocity ) between cdm and baryons on the small - scale structure formation .",
    "th first studied this effect by adopting a trivial solution to the large - scale velocity and density fields .",
    "because velocity fields are correlated with density fields , however , such a trivial solution can not accurately describe the physics in regions with non - zero overdensity .",
    "we thus improved on the work by th by implementing a non - trivial solution to the large - scale velocity and density fields , and we find that this causes a new type of coupling between large - scale and small - scale modes .",
    "this results in boosting the small - scale structure formation in overdense regions and suppressing that in underdense regions , aside from the suppression originating from the streaming velocity .",
    "the net effect on the structure formation is to boost the overall fluctuation , in terms of @xmath272 , and thus the `` negative '' effect by th is mitigated to some extent .",
    "depending on the wave mode ( @xmath7 ) and the observing redshift , @xmath272 can even be larger than that in the standard picture with @xmath250",
    ". the conditional halo mass function and the halo bias are also affected in similar ways .",
    "the results of this work show that the formation and evolution of small - scale structures depend strongly on not only the streaming velocity but also the density environment .",
    "the most important aspect of our work is that in contrast to th , who predict that regardless of the underlying density the local matter power spectrum of small - scale structures will be identical as long as @xmath9 is the same , the underlying large - scale ( @xmath276 a few mpc ) overdensity is another key parameter in addition to @xmath9 .",
    "this then requires re - examining previous work based on the formalism by th .",
    "we already showed that @xmath277 , @xmath272 , @xmath243 , @xmath235 , and @xmath268 are affected .",
    "if one were to simulate the nonlinear evolution of density perturbations and the structure formation in @xmath278mpc patches , he should generate initial conditions based on this work .",
    "as is seen in figure [ fig : pk_growth ] , we can not neglect the impact of overdensity even when the simulation starts at e.g. @xmath279 , because at @xmath280 the discrepancy between our prediction and that by th is already a few percent at that redshift .    both the previous semi - analytical work ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the semi - numerical work ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) should be re - examined .",
    "attempts to numerically simulate the nonlinear evolution of small - scale structures have been mostly limited to the physics inside mean - density regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or special , isolated regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "these numerical simulations thus need to be extended to incorporate @xmath134 which varies in space . in doing so , a reasonable method would be to use adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) codes with nested grids , so that one or a few interesting regions ( @xmath278mpc patches with @xmath281 , for example ) are treated with fine meshes and other regions with coarse meshes for computational efficiency .",
    "we also showed that cosmology through galaxy surveys should carefully consider the impact of the mode - mode couping , because the halo bias ( and galaxy bias as well ) would be boosted from not only the standard prediction with @xmath250 but also the prediction by th .",
    "cosmology with the intensity mapping may also be affected .",
    "the post - reionization intensity mapping targets the large - angle , diffuse 21-cm background from neutral hydrogen atoms inside galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because any galaxies , small or large , contribute to this cumulative 21-cm background , such observations will be affected by the streaming velocity through @xmath268 .",
    "the pre - reionization intensity mapping targets the large - angle , diffuse 21-cm background from the intergalactic neutral hydrogen atoms ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "even though this is free from the galaxy bias , the streaming velocity may act as a heating mechanism and boost the power spectrum of the velocity field ( @xcite ) , and therefore the new findings of our work should be incorporated .",
    "application to the study of the cosmic reionization process is of a prime interest in terms of the high - redshift astrophysics .",
    "the complex nature of the process usually requires numerical simulations , and they are performed through either efficient semi - numerical methods ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or fully numerical methods ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the early phase of cosmic reionization must have been driven by the first stars , possibly forming first in minihalos , as these are the first luminous objects in the universe .",
    "a very important factor that modulates the formation of the first stars inside minihalos is the lyman - werner intensity , which have been properly treated in simulations in a box large enough for statistical reliability but implementing subgrid physics for the first star formation inside minihalos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "to predict reionization scenarios to our best knowledge , especially on its early phase , this work should be properly incorporated because the star formation inside minihalos is strongly modulated by the streaming velocity as well .",
    "the results of this paper have rooms for further improvements .",
    "this paper is based on the presumption that the fluctuations at a few mpc scale remain linear even at later epochs .",
    "however , high density regions will reach the nonlinear regime earlier than the rest , and then our formalism will break down in such regions .",
    "the halo bias is more strongly pronounced in the nonlinear patches ( e.g. @xcite ) than in the linear theory , and thus one should use the actual values of the overdensity in such circumstances .",
    "one could achieve this goal by adopting the quasi nonlinear calculation ( e.g. 2lpt by @xcite ) , adopting the top - hat collapse model as in @xcite and @xcite , or for the best accuracy running n - body+hydro simulations which resolve the density fluctuation at @xmath276 mpc scale .",
    "then , in each patch of a few comoving mpc , equation ( [ eq : perturbation_k ] ) can be integrated with the newly computed values of @xmath134 s .",
    "wave modes in the range @xmath282/$]mpc are not accurately treated , because we based our formalism on the separability of the large - scale modes ( @xmath283mpc ) and the small - scale modes ( @xmath284mpc ) .",
    "the code we used will be released for the public use , but it requires technical improvements such as allowing parallel computation and porting to more generic computation languages .",
