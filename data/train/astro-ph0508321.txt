    "with the successful launch of the _ swift _ gamma - ray burst explorer , an era of systematic , multi - wavelength observations of grb early afterglows has been ushered in . very early optical / ir detections have been made with ground - based telescopes ( akerlof et al .",

    "swift_. in the x - ray band , some evidence of the early afterglows has been collected earlier ( e.g. piro et al . 1998 ; giblin et al . 1998 ; burenin et al . 1999 ; piro et al .",
    "however , it is the operation of the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) that offers the possibility to unveil the final gap between the prompt emission and the late afterglow stage .",
    "there has been widespread expectation that the early x - ray observations could answer a series of core questions in grb studies .",
    "what is the connection between the grb prompt emission and the afterglow ?",
    "are prompt emission and afterglow both from the external shock ( mszros & rees 1993 ; dermer & mitman 1999 ) or do they come from different locations [ i.e. prompt emission from the internal shocks ( rees & mszros 1994 ; paczynski & xu 1994 ) , while the afterglow comes from the external shock ( mszros & rees 1997a ; sari et al .",
    "does the central engine become dormant after the burst is over ?",
    "what is the immediate environment of the burst , an ism or a wind ?",
    "are there density clumps surrounding the grb progenitor ?",
    "what is the role of the reverse shock ?",
    "what is the initial lorentz factor of the fireball ?",
    "all these questions can be at least partially answered with the early x - ray afterglow data , sometimes in combination with the prompt gamma - ray data and the early optical / ir afterglow data .",
    "although early afterglow lightcurves have been extensively modeled in the optical band ( mainly driven by the observations and by the theoretical argument that the reverse shock emission component plays an important role in the optical band , e.g. mszros & rees 1997a ; sari & piran 1999 ; mszros & rees 1999 ; kobayashi 2000 ; kobayashi & zhang 2003a , b ; zhang et al .",

    "2005a ; fan & wei 2005 ) .    in its first six months of operations ,",
    "the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) has already accumulated a rich collection of early afterglow features in the x - ray band .",
    "the xrt is a sensitive broad - band ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) imager , which can be promptly slewed to grb targets triggered by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) within 1 - 2 minutes ( burrows et al .",
    "it is therefore an ideal instrument to study the transition between the grb prompt emission and the very early x - ray afterglow .",
    "the following features are all detected by xrt in a good sample of bursts ( see , e.g. chincarini et al . 2005 ; nousek et al .",
    "2005 for a collection of data ) , reflecting some common underlying physics of grbs .",
    "\\1 . in most cases ( e.g. grb 050126 and grb 050219a ) , a steep decay",
    "is observed up to several hundred seconds after the burst trigger , which is followed by a more conventional shallower decay ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 ; goad et al .",
    "this conclusion is drawn by choosing the grb trigger time as the zero time point ( @xmath0 ) . at later times ( e.g. @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the duration of the grb ) , the afterglow decay slope @xmath3 is essentially independent on the adopted @xmath0 . however , at early times ( e.g. @xmath4 not much larger than @xmath2 , the measured decay slope could be very sensitive to the assumed @xmath0 .",
    "tagliaferri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) explored the @xmath0 effect and concluded that the two distinct lightcurve segments are likely intrinsic rather than due to a poor choice of @xmath0 .",

    "usually it also connects to the spectral extrapolation of the bat prompt emission lightcurve smoothly ( barthelmy et al .",
    "all these facts indicate that the steep decay component is a distinct new component that may be unrelated to the conventional afterglow component .    \\2 . in a good fraction of grbs ( e.g. grb 050128 ,",

    "2005 ; grb 050319 , cusumano et al . 2005 ; and grb 050401 , de pasquale et al . 2005 ) , the early x - ray afterglow is characterized by a shallow to `` normal '' transition . during the transition",
    "the spectral index is not changed .",
    "the decay slope after the break ( e.g. @xmath5 ) is consistent with the standard ism afterglow model , while the decay slope before the break is usually much shallower ( e.g. @xmath6 ) .",
    "\\3 . in some cases ( e.g. grb 050315 , vaughan et al .",
    "2005 ) , a further steepening is detected after the `` normal '' decay phase , which is consistent with a jet break .",
    "bright x - ray flares have been detected in the early x - ray lightcurves of nearly one half of the burst population ( e.g. grb 050406 , grb 050202b , burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; romano et al .",
    "2005 ; falcone et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in particular , the x - ray afterglow of the short - hard burst grb 050724 also shows at least three flares ( barthelmy et al .",
    "the flares typically happen hundreds of seconds after the trigger or earlier , but in some cases they occur around a day ( e.g. grb 050502b , falcone et al .",
    "2005 ; grb 050724 , barthelmy et al .",
    "the amplitudes of the flares are usually larger than the underlying afterglow component by a factor of several ( e.g. a factor of 6 in grb 050406 , burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; romano et al . 2005 ) , but can be much larger ( e.g. @xmath7 in the case of grb 050202b , burrows et al . 2005 ; falcone et al .",
    "a similar feature was evident for grb 011121 detected by bepposax ( piro et al . 2005 ) .    in summarizing the current x - ray afterglow data",
    ", one can tentatively draw a synthetic cartoon lightcurve in the x - ray band , which consists of 5 components ( see figure [ xrtlc ] ) : i. an initial steep decay ( with a typical slope @xmath8 or steeper ) ; ii . a shallower - than - normal decay ( with a typical slope @xmath6 ) ; iii . a normal decay ( with a typical slope @xmath5 ) ; iv . a late steeper decay ( with a typical slope @xmath9 ) ; and v. one or more x - ray flares .",
    "we note that nousek et al ( 2005 ) also arrived at the similar schematic diagram that includes the segments i , ii and iii in our cartoon picture ( see their fig.3 ) . limited by the quality of the data ,",
    "the current analyses indicate that the spectral indices remain unchanged in the segments ii , iii and iv , with a typical value of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , nousek et al .",
    "2005 ) . in some bursts , the segments i and ii have different spectral indices ( e.g. grb 050319 , cusumano et al . 2005 ) . in some cases , a time - evolution of the spectral index has been detected ( e.g. in the giant flare of grb 050502b , falcone et al .",

    "the transition times between the adjacent segments for the four lightcurve segments are denoted as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we systematically study the physical processes that shape an early x - ray lightcurve , and discuss possible theoretical interpretations to the above phenomena . in ",
    "[ sec : curvature ] , we discuss the grb tail emission arising from high angular latitude relative to the viewing direction , which takes longer to reach the observer due to the extra distance it travels , as a conical ( or spherical ) shell suddenly stops shining .",
    "this is the so - called  curvature effect \" ( fenimore et al .",

    "2005 ) . in  [",
    "sec : fs ] , we review the main emission properties from the external forward shock region in the x - ray band , summarizing the temporal and spectral indices expected in the x - ray band for both the ism and the wind models .",
    "furthermore , we also discuss the case of a continuously refreshed shock as well as its three possible physical mechanisms .",
    "several case studies are investigated to reveal an intriguing refreshed shock phase commonly present in many bursts . in ",
    "[ sec : rs ] , we briefly discuss whether and how the reverse shock emission would influence the x - ray band emission . in ",
    "[ sec : flare ] , we explore various mechanisms that might give rise to the x - ray flares observed in many bursts ( e.g. grb 050406 and grb 050202b ) , and conclude that the phenomenon is best interpreted as due to a late central engine activity .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the temporal bridge between the grb prompt emission and the afterglow emission is essential for revealing whether the prompt emission and the afterglow originate from the same component .",
    "the earliest grb relativistic shock model invoked the external shock as the site for prompt @xmath15-ray emission ( rees & mszros 1992 ; mszros & rees 1993 ) .",
    "the rapid variability observed in many grbs is in great contrast with the intuitive expectations in the external shock model , which generally predicts a smooth burst temporal profile , and it has been argued that the radiative efficiency is too low for the model so that a much larger energy budget is required ( sari & piran 1997 ) .",
    "dermer & mitman ( 1999 , 2003 ) argued that if the grb ambient medium is sufficiently clumpy , an external shock grb model could reproduce the observed variability with a high energy efficiency .",
    "within such a picture , the prompt emission and the afterglow originate from the same component ( i.e. the external shock ) , and it is expected that the two emission components are likely smoothly connected in the early phase .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is now commonly believed that grb prompt emission originates from some `` internal processes '' , i.e. the @xmath15-rays are emitted before the fireball is decelerated by the ambient medium .",
    "the most widely discussed model is the internal shock model ( rees & mszros 1994 ; paczynski & xu 1994 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ; fan et al . 2004b ) .",
    "alternatively , the internal emission may be caused by dissipation of strong magnetic fields ( e.g. drenkhahn & spruit 2002 ) , or comptonization of the photospheric emission ( rees & mszros 2005 ) .",
    "within such scenarios , there exist two distinct temporal episodes dominated by the prompt emission and the afterglow , respectively , since the latter is emitted at a much larger distance from the central engine when the fireball is decelerated .",
    "generally one should expect a flux contrast between these two episodes .",
    "before the _ swift _ era , no solid observation was available to finally differentiate both scenarios , and evidence in favor of each scenario had been collected ( see e.g. zhang & mszros 2004 for a review ) .",
    "it is one of the major tasks of _ swift _ to pin down the emission site of the grb prompt emission .",
    "if the prompt emission and the afterglow arise from different emission sites , as is expected in the internal shock ( or similar ) scenario , and if the prompt emission flux level is much higher than the afterglow emission flux level , one expects to see a steeply decaying lightcurve during the transition from the prompt emission phase to the afterglow phase .",
    "such a steep decay is due to the so - called `` curvature effect '' ( e.g. kumar & panaitescu 2000a ; dermer 2004 ; dyks et al . 2005 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "2005 ) . in principle",
    ", such an effect also applies to the tail emission of the x - ray flares ( burrows et al .",
    "hereafter we generally define such an emission component as `` grb tail emission '' .        for",
    "a conical jet with an opening angle @xmath16 , emission from the same radius @xmath17 but from different viewing latitudes @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) would reach the observer at different times .",
    "even if the emission is turned off instantaneously , due to the propagation effect the observer would receive the emitted photons at the angle @xmath18 at @xmath20 .",
    "such a tail emission thus lasts for a duration of t_tail = ( 1+z ) ( r_cr / c ) ( _ j^2/2 ) 330  s ( ) ( ) . if the line of sight is not too close to the jet edge .",
    "we consider the simplest case of a jet moving with a constant bulk lorentz factor @xmath21 ( or a constant velocity @xmath22 ) .",
    "the electrons are shock - heated up to a radius @xmath17 , beyond which no fresh shocked electrons are injected , and the already heated electrons cool rapidly .",
    "the comoving emission frequency @xmath23 is boosted to @xmath24 in the observer s frame , where @xmath25^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor , which is @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for @xmath29 . since @xmath30 , one gets @xmath31 for @xmath29 .    the observed flux @xmath32 is related to the comoving surface brightness @xmath33 by f_l_ d^2 ( )^- d^2 ^- d^2 + ^- t^-2-  , where @xmath34 is the observed spectral index around the observed frequency @xmath35 , and the last proportionality is valid for @xmath36 . with the standard convention @xmath37 , one has the well - known result for the curvature effect ( e.g. kumar & panaitescu 2000a ; dermer 2004 ; fan & wel 2005 ; dyks et al .",

    "2005 ) = 2 +  .      in reality",
    ", the lorentz factor of the shell could be decreasing right before the sudden cessation of the emission .",
    "this is valid for the external shock case in the deceleration phase , or even in the internal shock case .",
    "we perform numerical calculations to investigate such an effect , normalized by a local injection rate ( moderski et al .",
    "the electrons cool down through synchrotron radiation and adiabatic expansion .",
    "all kinematic effects which affect the observed flux ( e.g. doppler boost , propagation time effects ) have been taken into account rigorously , following salmonson ( 2003 ) .",
    "the second code was developed by y. z. fan .",
    "this is an afterglow code developed from the dynamical model of huang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and has been used in several previous studies ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2004a ; fan et al .",
    "the latest addition is to also include the kinetic evolution of the electron distribution ( moderski et al .",
    "we have used both codes in various calculations in this paper , and the results are consistent with each other .",
    "the figures presented in this paper are all generated from the second code . ] .",
    "the curvature effect for the sudden switching - off of radiation in a decelerating outflow is presented figure [ fig : cur - ism ] , in which we plot the x - ray lightcurve from an expanding jet blastwave with @xmath38ergs , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "we manually turn off the radiation at radii ( @xmath43 ) of @xmath44 cm , @xmath45 cm , and @xmath46 cm , respectively , and investigate the subsequent curvature effect .",
    "the radiation from fluid elements at @xmath47 has been rigorously integrated .",
    "the result indicates that the @xmath48 conclusion is essentially unchanged .    .",
    "[ fig : cur - ism ]      another interesting issue is the jet structure . in principle , grb jets could be structured ( zhang & mszros 2002a ; rossi et al . 2002 ; zhang et al . 2004a ; kumar & granot 2003 ) .",
    "since the curvature effect allows one to see the high - latitude emission directly , an interesting question is whether the decay slope associated with the curvature effect depends on the unknown jet structure .",
    "we have investigated this effect with the first code , and find that for a relativistic outflow the temporal slope of the curvature effect is largely insensitive to the jet structure as long as the viewing angle is not far off the bright beam .",
    "the main reason is that the decrease of flux because of the curvature effect occurs on a much shorter timescale than that for the jet structure to take effect . for a spectral index @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) ,",
    "the flux decreases by @xmath51 orders of magnitude after a time of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the observer time at which the curvature effect began . for a typical @xmath54 , the flux drops by one order of magnitude after a short time @xmath55 .",

    "one can see that the structure of the outflow must have a typical angular scale smaller than @xmath57 in order to affect the observed flux before @xmath58 . for @xmath59",
    ", the parameters of the outflow would have to vary strongly on a scale smaller than one degree .",
    "nonetheless , the effect of the jet struture would start to play a noticeable role if the line of sight is outside the bright beam .",
    "detailed calculations are presented elsewhere ( dyks et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "almost all the _ swift _ xrt early afterglow lightcurves are categorized by a steep decay component followed by a more `` normal '' decaying afterglow lightcurve ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 ; nousek et al .",
    "2005 ) - see segment 1 in fig.[xrtlc ] . in most of these cases ,",
    "the measured @xmath61 and @xmath34 values in this rapidly decaying component are close to the @xmath60 relation , but in most cases , they do not match completely .",
    "this does not invalidate the curvature effect interpretation , however , since in principle the following factors would lead to deviations from the simple @xmath60 law .",
    "\\1 . the time zero point ( @xmath0 ) effect .",
    "in grb studies , the afterglow lightcurves are plotted in the log - log scale , with @xmath62 defined as the trigger time of the burst . when discussing the late afterglows , shifting @xmath0 by the order of the burst duration @xmath2",
    "does not make much difference . when discussing the early afterglow and its connection to the prompt emission , however , the decay power law index ( @xmath63 ) is very sensitive to the @xmath0 value one chooses .",
    "correctly choosing @xmath0 is therefore essential to derive the correct temporal decay index @xmath61 ( see e.g. kobayashi et al .",
    "2005b for a detailed discussion about the @xmath0 issue ) . in the case of the internal shock model , the case is straightforward .",
    "the observed pulses essentially track the behavior of the central engine ( kobayashi et al .",
    "each pulse marks another re - start of the central engine , so that @xmath0 should be re - defined for each pulse when the curvature effect of that pulse is considered .",
    "keeping the same @xmath0 as the beginning of the first pulse ( i.e. the grb trigger ) would inevitably lead to a false , very steep power law decay for later pulses .",
    "figure [ fig : internal ] gives an example to show this point .",
    "when a series of shells are successively ejected , each pulse will be followed by its tail emission due to the curvature effect , but most of these tails are buried under the main emission of the next pulse .",
    "the observed curvature effect is only the tail emission of the very last pulse . as a result , properly shifting @xmath0 is essential to interpret the steep decay component observed in xrt bursts .",
    "\\2 . the superposition effect .",
    "the observed steep - to - shallow transition in the early phase of xrt bursts ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ) suggests that by the end of the tail emission , the fireball is already decelerated , and the forward shock emission also contributes to the x - ray band . as a result ,",
    "the observed steep decay should also include the contribution from the forward shock .",
    "assuming the later has a temporal decay index @xmath64 , the x - ray flux at the early phase should read @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 are the time zero points for the steep decay component ( presumably of the internal origin ) and for the shallow decay component ( presumably of the external origin ) , respectively . in the intermediate regime between the two power - law segments ,",
    "both components are important , and the observed @xmath61 should be shallower than @xmath70 during the steep decaying phase .",
    "this effect flattens the decay instead of steepening it .",
    "if with the above two adjustments , the observed @xmath61 is still steeper than @xmath70 , one can draw the conclusion that the solid angle of the emitting region is comparable to or smaller than @xmath71 .",
    "this would correspond to a patchy shell ( kumar & piran 2000a ) or a mini - jet ( yamazaki et al . 2004 ) .",
    "a caveat on such an interpretation is that the probability for the line of sight sitting right on top of such a very narrow patch / mini - jet is very small . as a result",
    ", this model can not interpret an effect that seems to be a general property of x - ray afterglows .",
    "if with the first two adjustments , the observed @xmath61 is flatter than @xmath70 but is still much steeper than that expected from a forward shock model , there could be two possibilities .",
    "one is that the emission is still from the internal dissipation of energy but the emission in the observational band does not cease abruptly .",
    "this is relevant when the observational band is below the cooling frequency .",
    "the adiabatic cooling therefore gives a decay slope of @xmath72 rather than @xmath73 ( e.g. sari & piran 1999 ; zhang et al .",
    "the second possibility is that one is looking at a structured jet ( zhang & mszros 2002a ; rossi et al .",
    "2002 ) , with the line of sight significantly off - axis .",
    "the curvature effect in such a configuration typically gives a flatter decay slope than @xmath70 ( dyks et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant for x - ray rich grbs or x - ray flashes for which a large viewing angle is usually expected ( zhang et al .",
    "2004 ; yamazaki et al .",
    "further analyses of xrt data suggest that at least in some grbs , the decay slope is shallower than @xmath70 ( obrien et al .",
    "the above two possibilities are in particular relevant for these bursts .",
    "we suggest that most of the rapid - decay lightcurves observed by the _ swift _ xrt may be interpreted as grb ( or x - ray flare ) tail emission through the curvature effect , with the first two adjustments discussed above . in order to test this hypothesis , after the submission of this paper we have performed more detailed data analyses on a large sample of xrt bursts ( liang et al .",
    "2005 ) . by assuming that the decay slope should be @xmath70 , we search the appropriate @xmath0 that allows such an assumption to be satisfied .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 is usually at the beginning of the last pulse ( for the steep decay following the prompt emission ) or at the beginning of the x - ray flare ( for steep decay following flares ) .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that the curvature effect is likely to be the correct interpretation , and at the same time lends strong support to the internal origin of the prompt emission and x - ray flares ( see   2.3 & 5.7 for the arguments in favor of the internal models for both components ) .",
    "another potential test of the curvature effect is to search for a correlation between the spectral peak energy ( @xmath74 ) and the flux at the peak ( @xmath75 ) ( dermer 2004 ) .",
    "this requires a well measured @xmath74 in the xrt band . in most cases ,",
    "the xrt spectrum is consistent with a single power law .",
    "more detailed analyses on future bright x - ray flares are desirable to perform such a test .",
    "the current _ swift _ xrt observations of the early rapid - to - shallow decay transition of the x - ray lightcurves ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ) , when interpreted as the curvature effect , have profound implications for the understanding of the grb phenomenon .",
    "\\1 . it gives a direct observational proof that the grb prompt emission very likely comes from a different site than the afterglow emission .",
    "this suggests that the emission either comes from the internal shocks due to the collisions among many engine - ejected shells ( rees & mszros 1994 ; paczynski & xu 1994 ) , or is due to magnetic or other dissipation processes at a radius smaller than the fireball deceleration radius ( e.g. drenkhahn & spruit 2002 ; rees & mszros 2005 ) . in both scenarios ,",
    "the energy dissipation region is well inside the region where the deceleration of the whole fireball occurs .",
    "an interesting fact is that in most cases , after the prompt emission , the x - ray emission level ( that spectrally extrapolated from the bat data ) drops by several orders of magnitude ( through the curvature effect , in our interpretation ) before `` landing '' on the afterglow emission level .",
    "one could roughly estimate the expected `` drop - off '' .",
    "the flux level in the xrt band during the prompt phase could be roughly estimated as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the isotropic energy of the emitted gamma - rays , @xmath2 is the duration of the burst , @xmath78 kev is the typical energy in the xrt band , @xmath79 kev is the typical peak energy in the grb spectrum , and @xmath80 is the low - energy spectral index for a band - spectrum ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) . assuming that the x - ray band for the afterglow emission is above both the typical synchrotron frequency @xmath81 and the cooling frequency @xmath82 ( which is usually the case for the ism model , see eqs.[[tm]],[[tc ] ] )",
    ", the x - ray afterglow flux level can be estimated as ( e.g. freedman & waxman 2001 ) @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the isotropic energy of the afterglow kinetic energy , and @xmath85 is the electron equipartition parameter in the shock .",
    "the flux contrast can be estimated as ~ ( ) ( )  . for typical parameters ,",
    "one has @xmath86 and @xmath87 , so that the term in the bracket @xmath88 .",
    "although @xmath89 would generally suggest that @xmath90 should be higher than @xmath91 , the large contrast between the two components observed in many bursts is usually not accounted for unless @xmath77 is ( much ) larger than @xmath84 .",
    "this refers to a very high apparent grb radiation efficiency - even higher than the one estimated using the late x - ray afterglow data ( lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ) as discussed in  3.2 .",
    "because of the injection , the effective @xmath84 in the early epochs is smaller than that in the later epochs . as a result , a larger @xmath92 contrast is expected . ] .",
    "the commonly - invoked internal shock model predicts a low emission efficiency ( e.g. panaitescu et al . 1999 ; kumar 1999 ) .",
    "understanding such a high apparent radiation efficiency is therefore desirable ( see e.g. beloborodov 2000 ; kobayashi & sari 2001 ) .",
    "the common steep - to - shallow transition feature indicates that the fireball has already been decelerated at the time when the grb tail emission fades .",

    "the following conclusions could be drawn from the above case studies .",
    "a common feature of the early x - ray afterglow lightcurves is a well defined temporal steepening break .",
    "a crucial observational fact is that there is essentially no spectral variation before and after the break .",
    "this suggests that the break is of hydrodynamic origin rather than due to the crossing of some typical frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum in the band .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a lightcurve transition similar to the transition between segments ii and iii is expected in a radiative fireball ( e.g. bttcher & dermer 2000 ) , see e.g. figs . 1 & 2 of wu et al .",
    "however , that transition is due to the crossing of @xmath81 in the observational band .",
    "one therefore expects a large spectral variation before and after the break , which is inconsistent with the data .",
    "another straightforward interpretation would be a jet break , but there are three reasons against such an interpretation .",
    "first , in all the cases , @xmath127 has to be assumed .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the late jet breaks observed in the optical band , which typically have @xmath157 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath152 relation predicted in the jet model is usually not satisfied .",
    "second , the post - break @xmath152 relation is usually satisified in a standard slow cooling ism model , with the x - ray band either below or above the cooling frequency . in such a sense , this segment is quite `` normal '' .",
    "third , in some cases ( e.g. grb 050315 ) , another steepening break is observed after this normal segment , which is consistent with the jet break interpretation . since",
    "only one break could be attributed to a jet break , the `` shallow - to - normal '' break must be due to something else .",
    ". a natural interpretation of the shallow decay phase is to attribute it to a continuous energy injection , so that the forward shock is `` refreshed '' .",
    "three possibilities exist to account for the refreshed shock effect (  [ sec : fs2 ] ) : a long - lived central engine with progressively reduced activities , an instantaneous injection with a steep power - law distribution of the shell lorentz factors , and the deceleration of an instantaneously - injected highly magnetized ( high-@xmath99 ) flow . in terms of afterglow properties ,",
    "these possibilities are degenerate ( e.g. the connection between @xmath101 and @xmath158 ) and can not be differentiated . in principle",
    ", the first scenario may give rise to additional observational signatures ( e.g. rees & mszros 2000 ; gao & wei 2004 , 2005 ) , which may be used to differentiate the model from the others .",
    "two interesting characteristics during the injection phase are that the injection process is rather smooth , and that the effective @xmath101 value is around 0.5 .",
    "this gives interesting constraints on the possible physical mechanisms .",
    "( 1 ) for the scenario of a continuously injecting central engine ( zhang & mszros 2001 ) , the central engine luminosity must vary with time smoothly .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional grb central engine which injects energy erratically to allow the observed rapid variability in the lightcurves .",
    "this usually requires two different energy components , i.e. one `` hot '' fireball component that leads to the prompt emission and a `` cold '' poynting flux component that gives to the smooth injection .",
    "a natural poynting flux component is due to the spin - down of a new - born millisecond pulsar ( dai & lu 1998a ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) .",
    "however , a straightforward prediction from such a model is @xmath159 , not consistent with @xmath111 inferred from the observations .",
    "modifications to the simplest model are needed .",
    "alternatively , the system may be a long - lived black hole torus system with a reducing accretion rate .",
    "however , at later times the long - term central engine power corresponds to @xmath160 ( macfadyen et al .",
    "2001 ; janiuk et al .",
    "2004 ) , too steep to give an interesting injection signature .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the collapsar simulations ( macfadyen et al .",
    "2001 ) , an extended flat injection episode sometimes lasts for @xmath161s , which could potentially interpret the short injection phase of some bursts , but is difficult to account for some other bursts whose injection phase is much longer .",
    "( 2 ) for the scenario of a power - law distribution of lorentz factors ( rees & mszros 1998 ) , one should require that a smooth distribution of lorentz factors is produced after the internal shock phase . in the internal shock model , slow shells",
    "are indeed expected to follow the fast shells , but they tend to be discrete and give rise to bumpy lightcurves ( e.g. kumar & piran 2000a ) especially when the contribution from the reverse shock is taken into account ( zhang & mszros 2002b ) .",
    "it is also unclear how an effective @xmath111 is expected .",
    "( 3 ) deceleration of a promptly - ejected poynting - flux dominated flow ( e.g. zhang & kobayashi 2005 ) naturally gives a smooth injection signature observed . above case studies",
    "indicate that the injected energy is by a factor of several to 10 .",
    "within such a picture , the unknown @xmath99 value is about several to 10 .",
    "however , it is unclear how long the delay would be and whether one can account for the shallow decay with @xmath111 extending for @xmath162 seconds .",
    "further more detailed theoretical modeling is needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "any model needs to interpret the sudden cessation of the injection at @xmath163 .",
    "this time has different meanings within the three scenarios discussed above .",
    "( 1 ) within the long - lived central engine model , this is simply the epoch when the injection process ceases . in the pulsar - injection model",
    ", there is a well - defined time for injection to become insignificant ( dai & lu 1998a ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) , but within a black - hole - torus injection model , such a time is not straightforwardly defined . ( 2 ) in the varying lorentz factor scenario , this time corresponds to a cut - off of the lorentz factor distribution at the low end below which the distribution index @xmath158 is flatter than 1 so that they are energetically unimportant .",
    "this lowest lorentz factor is defined by _",
    "m = 23 ( ) ^1/8 t_b2,4 ^ -3/8 ( ) ^3/8 , a successful model must be able to address a well - defined @xmath164 in this model .",
    "( 3 ) within the poynting flux injection model , a well - defined time cut - off is expected , which corresponds to the epoch when all the poynting energy is transferred to the blastwave .",
    "if the shallow decay is indeed due to poynting energy transfer , the cut - off time ( @xmath13 ) could be roughly defined by the @xmath99 parameter through @xmath165 , where @xmath93 is the conventional deceleration time defined by @xmath166 , when only a fraction of @xmath167 energy is transfered to the ism ( zhang & kobayashi 2005 ) .    \\5 .",
    "although we have not tried hard to rule out a wind - model interpretation , the case studies discussed above suggest that the early afterglow data are consistent with an ism model for essentially all the bursts .",
    "this conclusion also applies to other well - studied _ swift _ bursts ( e.g. grb 050525a , blustin et al .",
    "this result is intriguing given that long grbs are associated with the death of massive stars , from which a strong wind is expected .",
    "previous analyses using late time afterglow data ( e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2002 ; yost et al .",
    "2003 ) have also suggested that most afterglow data are consistent with an ism model rather than a wind model . in order to accommodate the data ,",
    "it has been suggested that the wind parameter may be small so that at a late enough time the blastwave is already propagating in an ism ( e.g. chevalier et al .",
    "the _ swift _ results push the ism model to even earlier epochs ( essentially right after the deceleration ) , and indicate the need for a re - investigation of the problem .",
    "the epoch shortly before the deaths of massive stars is not well studied ( woosley et al .",
    "one possibility is that the stellar wind ceases some time before the star collapses .",
    "careful analyses of early afterglows of a large sample of long grbs may shed light on the final stage of massive star evolution .",
    "it is generally believed that a short - lived reverse shock exists during the intial deceleration of the fireball and gives interesting emission signatures in the early afterglow phase .",
    "given the same internal energy in both the forward - shocked and the reverse - shocked regions , the typical synchrotron frequency for the reverse shock emission is typically much lower than that in the forward shock region , since the ejecta is much denser than the medium .",
    "while the early forward shock synchrotron emission peaks in x - rays at early times , the reverse shock synchrotron emission usually peaks in the optical / ir band or even lower ( e.g. mszros & rees 1997a ; sari & piran 1999 ; kobayashi 2000 ; zhang et al . 2003 ; zhang & kobayashi 2005 )",

    "this might not be the case .",
    "in particular , the grb outflow may itself carry a dynamically important magnetic field component ( or poynting flux ) .",
    "this magnetic field would be shock - compressed and amplified , giving a larger effective @xmath168 ( fan et al .",
    "2004a , b ; zhang & kobayashi 2005 ) .",

    "although the rising phase could be very sharp , the decaying slope is rather flat .",
    "this is because of two effects .",
    "first , after entering the dense cloud , the blastwave lorentz factor falls off rapidly .",
    "the observed time @xmath217 is hence significantly stretched .",
    "the dashed line in fig.[fig : cloud ] represents the observed emission before the fireball exits the cloud .",
    "second , after the fireball exits the cloud ( dotted line in [ fig : cloud ] ) , the fireball does not decelerate immediately since the lorentz factor is already too low to be further decelerated in a medium with a low density .",
    "it is decelerated again when enough medium is swept up at a larger radius .",
    "the interaction of a fireball with density bumps has been studied previously by many authors ( e.g. lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ; dai & wu 2003 ) .",
    "our detailed calculations suggest that the variation caused by density inhomogeneities is generally not very significant ( see also ramirez - ruiz et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the lightcurves for a blastwave surfing on a density wave should be generally quite smooth ( cf .",
    "lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the one - dimensional model presented here effectively calculates the feature when the fireball encounters a high density shell . a more realistic model for density clumps should include the size of the clump ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "the lightcurve decay slope after the peak therefore depends on the comparison between @xmath219 and the angle the clump extends from the central engine , @xmath220 . if @xmath221 , the above calculation is still valid since the observer would not notice the edge of the clump .",
    "the resulting decay slope is rather shallow after the peak , which is in distinct contrast to the x - ray flare data .",

    "the lightcurve will steepen as @xmath219 becomes comparable to @xmath222 .",
    "our numerical calculations indeed show such a feature .",
    "however , the flux does not fall rapidly right after the peak .",
    "the peak time is typically shortly after the blastwave enters the density clump when the lorentz factor is still very high .",
    "the epoch when @xmath223 is satisfied happens much later .",
    "the lightcurve therefore still show a shallow decay segment before the steep decay component .",
    "this is in contrast with the x - ray flare data that show rapid decays right after the flare peak ( e.g. burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; falcone et al .",
    "2005 ; romano et al .",
    "2005 ; obrien et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one could make the clouds small enough , so that @xmath224 is satisfied from the very beginning .",

    "the 500 time contrast observed in grb 050502b is in any case very difficult to achieve within all the density clump models we have explored .",
    "we therefore tentatively conclude that the x - ray flares commonly detected in the early x - ray afterglow lightcurves are likely not caused by the putative density clouds surrounding the grb progenitors .",
    "the lack of these well - modeled features in the data also suggest that the lumpiness of circumburst medium is , if any , rather mild .",
    "we note , however , dermer ( 2005 , in preparation ) suggests that more detailed 3-d modeling of the density clump problem could potentially reproduce the observed x - ray flares .      in the collapsar progenitor models",
    ", it is expected that the ejecta generally has two components , one ultra - relativistic component powering the grb , and another moderately relativistic cocoon component ( e.g. zhang .",
    "et al . 2004b ; mszros & rees 2001 ; ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "this gives a physical motivation to the phenomenological two - component jet model ( e.g. lipunov et al . 2001 ; berger et al .",
    "2003 ; huang et al .",
    "an interesting possibility would be whether the x - ray flare following the prompt gamma - ray emission ( which arises from the central relativistic component ) is caused by the deceleration of the wider mildly - relativistic cocoon component as it interacts with the ambient medium .",
    "a straightforward conclusion is that the wide , off - beam component must contain more energy than the narrow component in order to give noticeable features in the lightcurve .",
    "also the decay after the lightcurve peak of the second component should follow the standard afterglow model , and the variability time scale satisfies @xmath225 .",
    "the optical lightcurves of the two component jet model have been calculated by huang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and granot ( 2005 ) .",
    "fig.[fig : twocomp ] shows a sample x - ray lightcurve in the two - component jet model .",
    "it is obvious that this model can not interpret the rapid fall - off observed in the xrt x - ray flares , and is therefore ruled out .",
    "a related model considers a jet with large energy fluctuations in the angular direction , so that its energy distribution is patchy ( kumar & piran 2000b ) .",
    "this is a variation of the two - component jet , and could be approximated as a multi - component jet .",
    "when the @xmath71 cone of different patches enter the field of view , the observed lightcurve may present interesting signatures .",
    "however , the general feature of the two - component jet still applies : only when a patch has a substantial energy compared with the on - beam jet would it give a bump feature on the lightcurve . after each bump ,",
    "the afterglow level is boosted and would not resume the previous level .",
    "the variability time scale is also typically @xmath225 .",
    "figure [ fig : patchy ] gives an example .",
    "apparently this model can not account for the observed x - ray flares .      in the internal shock model ,",
    "it is expected that after the collisions are finished , the shells are distributed such that a shell with a higher lorentz factor always leads a shell with a lower lorentz factor .",
    "as the fast moving shell ( blastwave ) is decelerated , the trailing slow shell will catch up with it and inject energy into the blastwave ( kumar & piran 2000a ) .",
    "such an injection also happens if the central engine further ejects high-@xmath21 shells that catch up with the decelerating blastwave ( zhang & mszros 2002b ) .",
    "such a collision would give rise to a bump signature on the lightcurve .",
    "a detailed treatment suggests that the overall lightcurve should include emission from three components : a forward shock propagating into the medium , a second forward shock propagating into the blastwave , and a reverse shock propagating into the injected shell . in the x - ray band ,",
    "the contribution from the reverse shock is negligible .",
    "the lightcurve generally shows a step - like signature , due to the increase of the total energy in the blastwave ( zhang & mszros 2002b ) . after the peak",
    ", the flux level does not resume the previous level since more energy has been injected into the fireball .",
    "the decay slope after the injection peak follows the standard afterglow model , and @xmath225 is expected .",
    "these are also inconsistent with the data of x - ray flares .",
    "another interesting possibility is whether x - ray flashes are the signature of the existence of free neutrons in the fireball .",
    "derishev et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , beloborodov ( 2003 ) and rossi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that a baryonic fireball contains free neutrons , the decay of which would leave important imprints on the lightcurve .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2005a ) modeled the process carefully and calculated the lightcurves .",
    "according to fan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the neutron - feature is rather smooth in a wind model , and it is hard to detect . in the ism case , on the other hand , a bump does exist ( in all bands ) .",
    "the physical reason is that the trailing proton shell catches up with the decelerated neutron - decay products .",
    "the physical process is analogous to the post energy injection effect discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : model6 ] .",
    "the amplitude of the flare is modest , at most a factor of several .",
    "since the injection model is not favored , this possibility is also disfavored .",
    "after ruling out various `` external - origin '' mechanisms , we are left only with the possibility that involves the re - activation of the central engine . in this interpretation ,",
    "the x - ray flares share essentially the same origin as the prompt gamma - ray emission , i.e. they are caused by some `` internal '' energy dissipation processes which occur before the ejecta is decelerated by the ambient medium .",
    "the leading scenario is the `` late '' internal shock model , which suggests that the central engine ejects more energy in the form of an unsteady wind with varying lorentz factors at a late time .",
    "these discrete shells collide with each other and produce the observed emission .",
    "alternatively , the late injection could be mainly in the form of magnetic fields / poynting flux , and the x - ray flares are due to the intermittent dissipation of the magnetic fields , likely through magnetic reconnection events .",
    "fan , zhang & proga ( 2005c ) argued that at least for the flares following short grbs , the process that powers the flares has to be magnetic - origin .",
    "there are two advantages of the `` internal '' models over the `` external '' models .",
    "first , re - starting the central engine equivalently re - set the time zero point . in this interpretation , the observed flare component and",
    "the underlying decaying component observed at the same observer time @xmath226 originate from different physical sites at different central engine times .",
    "let us assume that the initial burst lasts @xmath2 , that the central engine re - activates after a time interval @xmath227 , and that it ejects an unsteady wind with a typical variability time scale of @xmath228 .",
    "at the observer time @xmath229 s , the underlying decaying component ( external afterglow ) happens at a distance @xmath230 ^ 2 c t \\sim 5\\times 10^{16}$ ] cm , where @xmath231 is the lorentz factor of the blastwave at the time @xmath226 .",
    "the flare , on the other hand , happens at a distance of @xmath232 cm , where @xmath97 is the initial lorentz factor of the late - time ejecta . according to the clocks attached to the central engine , the photons from the external afterglow component",
    "are emitted at @xmath233s , while the photons from late central engine activity are emitted at @xmath234s .",
    "because of the relativistic effect , these photons reach the observer at exactly the same time @xmath226 , and superpose onto the lightcurve detected by the observer .",
    "when plotted as a single @xmath235 lightcurve with the origin at the burst trigger , a very steep apparent decay slope can be produced for a large time shift @xmath227 ( fig.[fig : internal ] ) .",
    "this naturally overcomes the @xmath236 constraint encountered by the external models ( ioka et al . 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "second , invoking a late central engine activity greatly eases the required energy budget . in most of the external models , in order to give rise to a significant bump on the lightcurve , the total newly - added energy ( either from the radial direction - late injection case , or from the horizontal direction - patchy jets or multiple - component jets ) must be at least comparable to the energy that defines the afterglow emission level .",
    "this model therefore demands a very large energy budget . for the internal model , on the other hand ,",
    "since the lightcurve is a superposition of two independent physical components , the energy budget is greatly reduced , especially if the bump happens at later times when the background afterglow level is much lower .",
    "for example , for an x - ray lightcurve with the decay index of -1 following a burst with duration 10 s , a significant flare at @xmath237s only requires a luminosity slightly larger than @xmath238 times of that of the prompt emission .",
    "this model is therefore very `` economical '' in interpreting the very late ( @xmath239s ) flares detected in some bursts ( e.g. grb 050502b , falcone et al .",
    "2005 ; and grb 050724 , barthelmy et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "can late central engine activity give rise to softer bursts ( e.g. x - ray flares as compared with the prompt gamma - ray or hard x - ray emission ) ?",
    "according to the internal shock model , the peak energy @xmath240 of the synchrotron spectrum satisfies ( zhang & mszros 2002c ) e_p b l^1/2 r^-1 l^1/2 ^-2 t^-1  , where @xmath241 is the luminosity , @xmath242 is the comoving magnetic field strength , @xmath21 is the typical lorentz factor of the wind ( for internal shock collisions , this @xmath21 is for slow shells ) , and @xmath243 is the variability time scale .",
    "we can see that a smaller @xmath241 , a higher @xmath21 and a larger @xmath243 would be favorable for a softer burst .",
    "the observed xrt x - ray flares generally have a smaller luminosity @xmath241 .",
    "the lightcurve is smoother with a larger @xmath243 ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; barthelmy et al .",
    "also , at later times , the environment tends to be cleaner so that @xmath21 could be larger .",
    "one therefore naturally expects softer flares at later times .",
    "can the central engine re - start after being quiescent for some time ( e.g. @xmath244s , but sometimes as late as @xmath245s ) ?",
    "this is an interesting theoretical problem .",
    "the collapsar model predicts a central engine time scale of minutes to hours ( macfadyen et al .",
    "the star may also fragment into several pieces during the collapse ( king et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the largest piece collapses first onto the black hole , powering a prompt gamma - ray burst .",
    "other fragments are intially ejected into elliptical orbits , but would eventually fall into the black hole after some time , powering the late x - ray flares .",
    "fragmentation could also happen within the accretion disk itself due to gravitational instabilities ( perna et al .",
    ". a magnetic - dominated accretion flow could also give rise to intermittent accretion flows due to interplay between the gravity and the magnetic barrier ( proga & begelman 2003 ; proga & zhang 2005 ) .",
    "flares could also occur in other central engine scenarios ( dai et al .",
    "the rich information collected by the _ swift _ xrt suggests that we are getting closer to unraveling of the details of the bursting mechanisms of grbs .",
    "more detailed studies are called for to unveil the mystery of these explosions .",
    "an interesting fact ( see next subsection for case studies ) is that the duration of the flares are positively correlated with the time at which the flare occurs .",
    "the later the flare , the longer the flare duration .",
    "a successful central engine model must be able to address such a peculiar behavior .",

    "this component is connected to the extrapolated bat lightcurve that shows a flare - like event around @xmath259s .",

    "the energy emitted during the third flare is comparable to that of the second one , and both are several times smaller than the energy of the first flare .",
    "all the rapid - decay components following the flares could be potentially interpreted as the high - latitude emission , given a proper shift of the zero time point .",

    "bursts , it is natural to spectulate that the event is also an x - ray flare caused by late central engine activity .",
    "fan & wei ( 2005 ) have suggested the late central engine activity and performed a detailed case study on this event .",
    "during the past several months , the _ swift _ xrt has collected a rich sample of early x - ray afterglow data .",
    "this , for the first time , allows us to peer at the final temporal gap left by the previous observations and to explore many interesting questions of grb physics . in this paper , we have systematically investigated various possible physical processes that could give interesting contributions to the early x - ray afterglow observations .",
    "this includes the tail emission of the prompt gamma - ray emission , both the forward shock and the reverse shock emission components , refreshed shocks , post energy injection , medium density clumps near the burst , angular inhomogeneities of the fireball , emission component due to the presence of free neutrons , as well as emission from late central engine activity .",
    "we discuss how the above processes might leave interesting signatures on the early x - ray afterglow lightcurves .    based on the xrt data collected so far , we summarize the salient features and suggest a tentative synthetic lightcurve for the x - ray afterglow lightcurves . as shown in fig .",
    "[ xrtlc ] , the synthetic lightcurve includes five components : i. an intial steep decay component ; ii . a shallow - than - normal decay component ; iii . a `` normal '' decay component ; iv . a post - jet break component ; and v. x - ray flares .",
    "the components i and iii appear in almost all the bursts .",
    "other three components also commonly appear in some bursts .",
    "flares have been detected in nearly half of the xrt early lightcurves , and the shallow decay segment has also been discovered in a good fraction of _ swift _ grbs .",
    "we therefore believe that they represent some common underlying physics for grbs . after comparing data with various physical models",
    ", we tentatively draw the following conclusions .",
    "\\1 . the rapid decay component ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ) commonly observed in the very early afterglow phase ( which usually has a different spectral slope than the late shallow decay components ) is very likely the tail emission of the prompt gamma - ray bursts or of the early x - ray flares . allowing proper shifting of the time zero point and considering the contribution of the underlying forward shock emission , we speculate that essentially all the steep decay cases could be understood in terms of the `` curvature effect '' of the high - latitude emission as the emission ceases abruptly . more detailed data analyses ( liang et al .",
    "2005 ) support such a speculation .",
    "the transition between the prompt emission and the afterglow emission appears to be universally represented by a rapid decay followed by a shallower decay , indicating that the grb emission site is very likely different from the afterglow site , and that the apparent gamma - ray efficiency is very high .",
    "\\3 . in a good fraction of grbs ( e.g. grbs 050128 , 050315 ,",
    "050319 , 050401 , campana et al . 2005 ; vaughan et al . 2005 ; cusumano et al . 2005 ; de pasquale et al . 2005 ) , a clear temporal break exists in the early x - ray lightcurves .",
    "there is no obvious spectral index change across the break .",
    "the temporal decay index before the break is very flat , while that after the break is quite `` normal '' , i.e. is consistent with the standard afterglow model for a fireball with constant energy expanding into an ism .",
    "we suggest that these breaks are likely not `` jet breaks '' .",
    "rather they mark the cessation of an early continuous energy injection phase during which the external shock is refreshed .",
    "we suggest three possible physical mechanisms for the refreshed shocks , i.e. a long - lived central engine with a decaying luminosity , a power law distribution of the shell lorentz factors before deceleration begins , and the deceleration of a high-@xmath99 flow .",
    "further studies are needed to better understand this phase .",
    "\\4 . in the `` normal '' phase ,",
    "the data for many bursts are consistent with an ism medium rather than a wind medium .",
    "this has important implications for understanding the massive star progenitors of long grbs , including their late evolution stage shortly before explosion .",
    "given that most of the shallow - to - normal transitions are due to the cessation of the refreshed shock phase , the cases with a well - identified jet break are not very common .",
    "nonetheless , jet breaks are likely identified in some bursts , e.g. grb 050315 ( vaughan et al .",
    "2005 ) , grb 050525a ( blustin et al . 2005 ) , xrf 050416 ( sakamoto et al . 2005 ) , and some others .",
    "the x - ray flares detected in nearly half of the _ swift _ bursts are most likely due to late central engine activity , which results in internal shocks ( or similar energy dissipation events ) at later times .",
    "it seems to us that there is no evidence for the existence of density clumps in the grb neighborhood , and there is no support for strong angular inhomogeneities ( e.g. two - component jet , patchy jets ) for the grb fireball .",
    "however , their existence is not ruled out .",
    "the similar lightcurves for some long grbs ( e.g. grb050502b , burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) and some short grbs ( e.g. grb050724 , barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) indicate that different progenitor systems may share some similarities in the central engine .",
    "this might be caused by the same underlying physics that controls the hyper - accreting accretion disk - a common agent in charge both types of systems ( perna et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the _ swift _ xrt is still rapidly accumulating data on the early x - ray afterglows .",
    "more careful statistical analyses of these x - ray data , as well as more detailed case studies , also including low frequency data collected by uvot and other ground - based telescopes , would greatly imporve our knowledge about grb prompt emission and afterglows , advancing the quest for the final answers to the core questions in the study of grbs .",

    "<S> with the successful launch of the _ swift _ gamma - ray burst explorer , a rich trove of early x - ray afterglow data has been collected by its on - board x - ray telescope ( xrt ) . </S>",
    "<S> some interesting features are emerging , including a distinct rapidly decaying component preceding the conventional afterglow component in many sources , a shallow decay component before the more `` normal '' decay component observed in a good fraction of grbs ( e.g. grb 050128 , grb 050315 , grb 050319 , and grb 050401 ) , and x - ray flares in nearly half of the afterglows ( e.g. grb 050406 , grb 050502b , grb 050607 , and grb 050724 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these interesting early afterglow signatures reveal valuable and unprecedented information about grbs , including the prompt emission - afterglow transition , grb emission site , central engine activity , forward - reverse shock physics , and the grb immediate environment . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we systematically analyze the possible physical processes that shape the properties of the early x - ray afterglow lightcurves , and use the data to constrain various models . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the prompt gamma - ray bursts and/or of the x - ray flares . </S>",
    "<S> this provides strong evidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are likely two distinct components , supporting the internal origin of the grb prompt emission . </S>",
    "<S> the shallow decay segment observed in a group of grbs suggests that very likely the forward shock keeps being refreshed for some time . </S>",
    "<S> this might be caused either by a long - lived central engine , or by a wide distribution of the shell lorentz factors , or else possibly by the deceleration of a poynting flux dominated flow . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray flares suggest that the grb central engine is very likely still active after the prompt gamma - ray emission is over , but with a reduced activity at later times . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> , the central engine activity even extends to days after the burst triggers . </S>",
    "<S> analyses of early x - ray afterglow data reveal that grbs are indeed highly relativistic events , and that early afterglow data of many bursts , starting from the beginning of the xrt observations , are consistent with the afterglow emission from an interstellar medium ( ism ) environment . </S>"
