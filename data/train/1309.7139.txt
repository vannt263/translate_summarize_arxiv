    "this corresponds to the conductively cooled regions enclosed by concave cnm surfaces .",

    "figure [ fig : ldep]a reveals that the saturation levels increase with @xmath39 .",
    "this trend can be understood from the driving mechanism of turbulence .",
    "if the simulation box is too small , the effect of conductive cooling can traverse the simulation box size within the survival time of curved interfaces , and a quasi - isobaric state is quickly established . as a result ,",
    "driving of fast flows is limited , leading to a small turbulent velocity .    fig .",
    "[ fig : ldep]b shows the box size dependence of the saturation level .",

    "the expected saturation level is consistent with the typical velocity shown in equation ( [ curve ] ) .",
    "@xcite have investigated the dependence of the saturation level on the simulation box , and found that the velocity dispersion saturates for @xmath183 , and the saturation level is @xmath184 km s@xmath182 .",
    "this conclusion appears to contradict our result in section [ sec : ldep ] .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that they adopted an artificially large thermal conductivity and viscosity for calculations with larger boxes @xcite .",
    "we have done the same calculation for the case with @xmath185pc .",
    "after 100 myr , when they terminate the calculation , we find that the turbulence decays because of artificially large viscosity .",
    "the saturation found by @xcite may come from the initial growth of the ti .",
    "@xcite performed similar calculations with a different analytic net cooling rate .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , they used an artificially large thermal conductivity and viscosity that are proportional to density .",
    "if we use the same conditions in our two - dimensional calculations , we also observe decaying turbulence . to drive turbulence , it is important that turbulence in the cnm deforms the interface .",
    "however , because of the large viscosity , the turbulence quickly decays .",
    "another difference between our work and theirs is the dimenstionality .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .      in this paper , we focus on the two - dimensional evolution of a bistable gas .",
    "it is well known that the evolution of vorticity strongly depends on the dimensionality . in two dimensions ,",
    "enstrophy is conserved .",
    "thus , the vortex filaments behave like particles . on the other hand , in three dimensions ,",
    "a vortex cascades into smaller vortices though stretching .",
    "note that the deformation of cnm surfaces requires relatively large vortices in the cnm . for three dimensions",
    ", it is expected that the deformation of cnm surfaces becomes inefficient .",
    "thus , it is possible that the driving mechanism proposed in this paper can not maintain turbulence in three dimensions .",
    "however , no one has performed three - dimensional simulations with sufficient resolution to resolve the thickness of the cnm / ifm interface @xcite because the required computational cost is enormous . to simulate the three dimensional simulation efficiently ,",
    "one of the promising methods is adaptive mesh refinement technique , for example , with a refinement criterion based on the local field length .",
    "the effect of three dimensions is beyond the scope of this paper , but should be investigated in forthcoming work .      in this paper , for simplicity we focus on the two - dimensional hydrodynamical evolution of a bistable fluid without magnetic fields .",
    "however , in realistic situations , magnetic fields play important roles in the dynamics of a bistable fluid because the typical magnetic field strength of hi gas is about a few micro gauss @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional evolution of magnetized bistable gas has been investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they show that ambipolar diffusion efficiently transports magnetic field across a transition layer , leading to a flat magnetic field strength profile .",
    "however , the multi - dimensional evolution is still unclear . the plasma beta of hi gas is less than or comparable to unity",
    "therefore , the turbulent velocity is less than the alfvn speed of @xmath186 for the cnm and @xmath187 for the wnm .",
    "this corresponds to weak alfvnic turbulence where the energy preferentially cascades in directions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field in the ideal mhd limit @xcite .",
    "thus , the outcome can be similar to two - dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the effects of magnetic fields will be investigated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the self - sustaining mechanism drives turbulence in the cnm at the level of about @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the velocity dispersion ( @xmath188 at @xmath189 ) in the real ism is much larger than that found in this paper ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the turbulence analyzed in the paper can not alone explain the interstellar turbulence quantitatively .",
    "the difference between turbulence in this paper and the interstellar turbulence could be a consequence of the oversimplified setup in the paper . in turbulence under periodic boundary condition without any dynamical forcing ,",
    "the two stable phases ( wnm / cnm ) are completely separated and the unstable gas resides only in the interfaces between the wnm / cnm . in this case , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ent ] , thermal conduction is the most important thermal process , it drives only weak turbulence with @xmath190 .    in realistic astrophysical environments , on the other hand , the ism is frequently disturbed and compressed by energetic phenomena the length scales of which are larger than a few parsec , such as expansions of hii regions and supernova explosions with timescale on the order of 1myr @xcite that is comparable to the typical time scale of the kinetic energy injection derived in section [ sec : typ_time ] .",
    "thus , the large scale disturbances should be important for the interstellar turbulence .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the shock compression of the ism induces turbulence which is composed of shocked warm gas and cold cloudlets . the velocity dispersion is comparable to the observed values . recently , similar calculations have been performed by many authors @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed mechanism to create turbulent structure is not fully analysed because of its complexity .",
    "one important difference between turbulence in shocked ism and this paper is the physical properties of the unstable gas ( ifm ) .",
    "the shock heated gases are thermally unstable and subject to strong radiative cooling by which the cnm is formed .",
    "this cooling drives gas flows that reach a velocity as large as @xmath46 several km s@xmath182 .",
    "since this typical velocity is large , the reynolds number becomes high enough for turbulence to be driven . unlike the turbulence in this paper",
    ", thermal conduction is less important because of the strong radiative cooling .",
    "in addition to the ti ( strong radiative cooling ) , turbulence in the unstable gas is driven by vortex generation due to the baroclinic effect , the richtmyer - meshkov instability @xcite .",
    "the results in sections [ sec : selfsus ] show that the kinetic energy transfer from the unstable gas to the cnm through the phase transition is the main driving source of turbulence in the cnm .",
    "the same process can be expected in realistic situations with strong shocks , in addition to other possible driving mechanisms of turbulence , such as the kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities . since the velocity dispersion of the unstable gas is larger ( @xmath46 several km s@xmath182 ) , the transferred turbulent kinetic energy is expected to be larger . the resultant velocity dispersion inside individual cnm clouds may be supersonic ( sound speed of cnm @xmath46 0.2 km s@xmath182 ) .",
    "this mechanism may also affect molecule formation inside the cnm because of the mixing between fresh cnm and preexisting cnm .",
    "these subjects will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the turbulent structure of the bistable ism by using two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with a realistic cooling rate , thermal conduction , and physical viscosity .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "it is confirmed that turbulence is sustained for at least 500 myr without any dynamical forcing .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the ifm is comparable to that of the cnm while that of the wnm is only half of that of the other two phases .",
    "the dominant contribution to the velocity dispersion is provided by the cnm because of its large mass fraction .",
    "fast flows are observed in the ifm near strongly deformed cnm / ifm interfaces .",
    "there are two prominent flows .",
    "first , gas in the ifm streams into concave cnm surfaces .",
    "second , gas in the ifm flows towards the wnm from pillars of the cnm . it is found that these fast ifm flows are driven by thermal conduction .",
    "the mechanisms of driving and dissipation of kinetic energy are investigated in the saturation state of the three phases . in the cnm ,",
    "the dominant driving mechanism is kinetic energy injection from the ifm through the phase transition .",
    "this injected kinetic energy comes from the fast flows driven by strong conductive cooling near concave cnm surfaces .",
    "since the ifm near concave cnm surfaces is surrounded by the cnm , the pressure drop due to conductive cooling in the ifm induces relatively large pressure fluctuations in the cnm .",
    "a self - sustaining mechanism of bistable turbulence is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] .",
    "turbulence inside the cnm creates concave cnm surfaces .",

    ", the deformation of cnm surfaces by turbulence eventually enhances its kinetic energy .",
