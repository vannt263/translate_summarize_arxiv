    "electron - hole doping asymmetry in mott insulators has been one of the key questions related to the origin of superconductivity in the proximity of the insulating state @xcite . to investigate this",
    ", one should prepare an exactly half - filled ( zero - doped ) mott insulator and then inject or extract electrons , preferably by an electrostatic method , in the same sample .",
    "however , it is difficult to perform such measurements on high-@xmath0 cuprates for the following three reasons .",
    "first , they are mostly either only hole - doped or electron - doped , and the crystallographic structures of the parent materials are often different .",
    "second , they require a strong electric field to tune their band filling owing to their high half - filled carrier density ( on the order of 10@xmath1 @xmath2 ) .",
    "third , since they are charge - transfer - type insulators , electrons and holes are doped into different electronic orbitals , which may obscure the pure doping asymmetry . in practice",
    ", the inverse of the hall coefficient monotonically increases with increasing doping concentration with the sign changing across the zero - doping point @xcite .",
    "this is a feature of band insulators rather than mott insulators .",
    "in contrast to the high-@xmath0 cuprates , the organic mott insulator @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4cu[n(cn)@xmath4]cl @xcite ( abbreviated to @xmath3-cl hereafter ) , where bedt - ttf represents bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene , serves as an appropriate material for examining the electron - hole asymmetry of doped mott insulators because of its relatively low carrier density ( @xmath61.8@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath2 ) and its single electronic orbital nature .",
    "indeed , electrons and holes are doped into the same @xmath9 electron band and thus @xmath3-cl can be modeled as a single band hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice ( fig .  [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "due to its high controllability of electronic states , @xmath3-cl has been studied intensively in terms of the bandwidth - controlled mott transition between mott insulating and superconducting states at half filling @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic method of carrier doping into organic mott insulators with field - effect transistor ( fet ) structure has been implemented by the authors @xcite .",
    "however , the limited doping concentration with the fet still forbids the observation of electron - hole asymmetry .    here , by fabricating electric - double - layer transistors ( edlts ) based on thin single crystals of @xmath3-cl , we realised for the first time both electron and hole doping into the organic mott insulator .",
    "we measured the field effect on transport properties including the sheet resistivity , hall coefficient and resistivity anisotropy to elucidate the doping anisotropy of the electronic state in the doped organic mott insulator . to provide further insights into the fermi surface ( fs ) , we calculated the single - particle spectral functions for an effective model of @xmath3-cl by using cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations predict that strongly anisotropic suppression of the spectral weight results in the fermi arc state under hole doping , while a relatively uniform spectral weight results in the emergence of a non - interacting - like fs in the electron - doped state . in accordance with the calculations ,",
    "the experimentally observed hall coefficients and resistivity anisotropy correspond to the pocket formed by the fermi arcs under hole doping and to the non - interacting fs under electron doping .",
    "we fabricated the edlt devices by mounting an ion gel on a hall - bar - shaped thin single crystal of @xmath3-cl and a au side gate electrode ( figs .",
    "2a and 2b ) .",
    "first , we obtained the resistivity curve for the sheet resistivity @xmath10 at the temperature @xmath11 k ( fig .  [ fig.2]c ) . as expected for a mott insulator , a clear ambipolar field effect with a resistance peak at the gate voltage",
    "@xmath12 v was observed .",
    "the hysteresis and the leakage current remained small without any signature of a chemical reaction between the electrolyte and @xmath3-cl .",
    "note that the field effect was about 3% at 220 k because thermally excited carriers in the bulk ( about 100 molecular layers in a typical sample ) dominated the electrical conduction owing to the low charge excitation gap ( ca .",
    "we also confirmed that the carrier tunability of the @xmath3-cl edlt greatly exceeded that of sio@xmath4-based fets by comparing these devices using the same @xmath3-cl crystal ( fig .",
    "[ fig.s1 ] ) .",
    "provided that the mobilities of the fet and edlt are equivalent , a gate voltage of + 1 v in the edlt corresponded to approximately 20% electron doping ( see supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "the resistivity curves at 220 k and the temperature dependences of the resistivity were reproducible after multiple temperature cycles ( see supplementary note 2 and fig .  [ fig.s2 ] ) .    with decreasing temperature ,",
    "the ambipolar field effect became more distinct .",
    "figures  [ fig.2]d and  [ fig.2]e show the temperature dependence of the sheet resistivity under a negative gate voltage ( hole doping ) and positive gate voltage ( electron doping ) , respectively . under hole doping ,",
    "the activation energy significantly decreased to less than 1 mev at @xmath13 = @xmath141.35 v. on the other hand , the doping of electrons tended to reduce the resistivity more effectively and metallic conductivity was observed at @xmath151 v. in a high - conductivity sample , we observed negative magnetoresistance accompanied with the upturn of resistivity at low temperature , which suggested a weak localisation effect ( see supplementary note 3 and fig .",
    "[ fig.s3 ] ) .",
    "analysis of the weak localisation indicated that the mean free path and dephasing length considerably exceeded the distance between bedt - ttf dimers indicating coherent transport .      to observe a more significant difference between the electron- and hole - doped states , we measured the hall coefficient @xmath16 , which indicates the fs topology .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath17 dependence of the hall resistance @xmath18 at 30 k is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3]a ( @xmath16 is given by the slope ) . despite electron doping , the hall coefficients were clearly positive and a simple estimation of the carrier density , @xmath19 , gave about 0.8 holes per bedt - ttf dimer . since the injected carriers were electrons ( @xmath60.2 electrons / dimer ) , the concentration of which was much lower than that of the observed holes , it suggests that dense hole carriers are delocalised by electron doping .",
    "this is considered to be the doping - induced mott transition previously observed in fet devices @xcite .",
    "if we assume doping symmetry , a similar hall effect is expected for the hole - doped side .",
    "namely , hole doping immediately collapses the mott - hubbard gap and @xmath19 corresponding to 1@xmath20 ( @xmath21 : electron doping concentration , which is negative for hole doping ) holes per bedt - ttf dimer should be observed .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3]a , the hall coefficient on the hole - doped side was about three times larger than that on the other side , and @xmath19 gave about 0.3 holes per bedt - ttf dimer .",
    "although @xmath19 increased with increasing absolute value of the gate voltage , the rate of increase was low ( only 7% difference between @xmath13 = @xmath140.8 v and -1.2 v ) .",
    "surprisingly , under hole doping , @xmath19 per dimer appears to be neither 1@xmath20 ( delocalised",
    "hole carriers + injected hole carriers ) nor @xmath20 ( only injected hole carriers ) , indicating that the localised carriers were partially delocalised by excess hole doping as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3]c .",
    "these results indicate that the fs topology is significantly different between the electron- and hole - doped states . for the gate voltage dependence of the hall mobility ,",
    "see supplementary note 4 and fig .",
    "[ fig.s5 ] . the temperature dependence of @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.3]b ) shows that the @xmath16 asymmetry was maintained up to about 50 k , above which the hall effect at the doped surface was obscured by the thermally excited carriers in the bulk .",
    "note that increase in @xmath16 at 30 k upon cooling is due to the decrease of the thermally excited carriers in the bulk ( see supplementary note 5 and fig .  [ fig.s6 ] ) .",
    "the data below 25 k contain ambiguity owing to the non - ohmic behaviour ( see supplementary note 6 and fig .  [ fig.s4 ] ) .",
    "what is the origin of @xmath16 under hole doping ? as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , @xmath3-cl forms essentially an anisotropic triangular lattice resulting in an ellipsoidal non - interacting fs which is folded by the zone boundary . in a fermi liquid with a single type of carrier",
    ", @xmath19 denotes the carrier density corresponding to the volume enclosed by the fs ( luttinger s theorem @xcite ) . under electron doping , @xmath19 is close to the carrier density corresponding to the non - interacting ellipsoidal fs ( known as the @xmath22-orbit in the study of shubnikov - de haas oscillation @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , @xmath19 under hole doping somehow appears to correspond to the volume bounded by the lenslike closed portion of the fs ( known as the @xmath23-orbit ) .",
    "the doping dependences of the carrier density enclosed by the @xmath23- and @xmath22-orbits assigned for a @xmath3-bedt - ttf salt @xcite are plotted as reference in fig .",
    "[ fig.3]c .      to verify this @xmath16 asymmetry ,",
    "we calculated the single - particle spectral functions of the hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice ( @xmath24 = @xmath140.8 , @xmath25 = 7 ) at 30 k using cpt and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] .",
    "first , the mott insulating state was reproduced at half filling , where the energy gap opened at all the k - points ( figs . 4b and 4e ) . when electrons were doped ( @xmath21 = + 0.17 )",
    ", the fs appeared as shown in figs . 4c and 4f .",
    "the fs topology was the same as that of the non - interacting case , although the shape and the spectral weight were not exactly the same . in this state",
    ", the value of @xmath16 should be close to that of the fermi liquid state , as suggested by the experiments . on the other hand , the fs under hole doping ( @xmath21 = @xmath140.17 ) was very different from the non - interacting fs ( figs . 4a and 4d ) .",
    "the spectral weight near the z point was strongly suppressed .",
    "namely , arcs around the x point and pseudogaps near the z point appeared .",
    "the partial disappearance of fs by the pseudogap is similar to the fermi arc state observed in lightly hole - doped cuprates @xcite . in this state ,",
    "luttinger s theorem is seemingly violated and the value of @xmath16 is no longer simply estimated . however , considering the first brillouin zone ( bz ) of @xmath3-cl , one can see that the fermi arcs are folded and form closed lenslike orbits .",
    "these orbits originate from the @xmath23-orbit mentioned above and correspond to the observed @xmath16 in the hole - doped states .",
    "these results imply that @xmath16 is predominantly governed by quasi - particles with relatively long lifetime ( bright points of the spectral function in the reciprocal space in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry of the fs topology was clearly observed via @xmath16 .      the partial disappearance of the fs",
    "can also be confirmed by the anisotropy in the carrier conduction .",
    "the strongly suppressed parts of the fs under hole doping should affect strongly the carrier conduction along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "indeed , our cpt calculations predict that the resistivity is more anisotropic in the hole - doped state than in the electron - doped state ( see supplementary note 7 and fig .",
    "[ fig.opt ] ) .",
    "we measured the resistivity anisotropy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] .",
    "the crystallographic axes were determined by the crystal shape and the sign of the seebeck coefficient at room temperature . at 220 k where the thermally excited carriers in the non - doped bulk dominates the conductivity ,",
    "the @xmath26-axis resistivity @xmath27 was slightly higher than the @xmath28-axis resistivity @xmath29 in both electron and hole doping .",
    "with decreasing temperature , @xmath30 increased under hole doping while it decreased and remained near 1 in the non - doped and electron - doped states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5]b .",
    "the contour plot of @xmath31 under various gate voltage and temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig.5]c ) clearly exhibited that the resistivity in the hole - doped state was particularly anisotropic , in good qualitative agreement with our cpt calculations .",
    "the doping asymmetry is expected from the particle - hole asymmetric non - interacting band structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1]c .",
    "the energy bands along the z - m axis are very flat and the van hove singularity ( vhs ) lies below the fs at half filling . with the doping of holes , the fs approaches the vhs and the effect of the interaction",
    "is expected to be enhanced . indeed , substantial suppression of the spectral weight of the fs along the z - m axis , on which the van hove critical points lie , is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4]a ) .",
    "by contrast , the fs departs from the vhs with the doping of electrons , resulting in a weaker interaction effect and a more non - interacting - like fs .",
    "it is also indicated that the spin fluctuation is stronger in the hole - doped state because of the vhs .",
    "if a superconducting state could be induced by further hole doping , the transition temperature and pairing symmetry are of great interest since the hole - doped state is substantially different from the metallic state created by controlling the bandwidth at half filling .",
    "to summarise , without gate voltage , @xmath3-cl is a mott insulator due to electron interaction and high commensurability between the hole density and periodic potential ( 1 hole / 1 site ) . when holes or electrons are doped , the commensurability is reduced and the effect of electron interaction is weakened , resulting in carrier delocalisation .",
    "however , the effect of interaction remains strong at specific k - points where the energy dispersion is relatively flat .",
    "owing to the particle - hole asymmetric band structure , the pseudogaps appeared only near the van hove critical points under hole doping .",
    "in contrast to the calculations , our measurements did not observe the true metallic state ( @xmath32 ) at low temperature .",
    "this is probably due to the effect of localisation caused by finite random potential at the surface @xcite , as the negative magnetoresistance indicated .",
    "improvement of the surface roughness and cleanness may realise metallic phases under both dopings .",
    "thus , the doping asymmetry in a mott insulator was demonstrated by a simple process in an organic mott edlt .",
    "the above results show that organic mott insulators are good model materials for mott physics even in the case of band - filling control , and the electronic state in a simple mott insulator may be predictable in the framework of cpt . since molecular conductors consist of various molecules with different arrangements , the effect of doping into materials with different fs topologies is of interest in future experiments .",
    "furthermore , the presence / absence of the superconducting phase under doping and its doping asymmetry are also intriguing .",

    "<S> it is widely recognised that the effect of doping into a mott insulator is complicated and unpredictable , as can be seen by examining the hall coefficient in high @xmath0 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the doping effect , including the electron - hole doping asymmetry , may be more straightforward in doped organic mott insulators owing to their simple electronic structures . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the doping asymmetry of an organic mott insulator by carrying out electric - double - layer transistor measurements and using cluster perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations predict that strongly anisotropic suppression of the spectral weight results in the fermi arc state under hole doping , while a relatively uniform spectral weight results in the emergence of a non - interacting - like fermi surface in the electron - doped state . in accordance with the calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed hall coefficients and resistivity anisotropy correspond to the pocket formed by the fermi arcs under hole doping and to the non - interacting fermi surface under electron doping . </S>"
