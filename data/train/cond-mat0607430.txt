    "gel electrophoresis is commonly used in biological science to separate out dna molecules according to their size .",
    "a longer dna has lower electrophoretic mobility in the random environment of a gel , the separation therefore would be possible using dc electric field .",
    "however , it is well known that gel electrophoresis loses its efficiency for dna molecules longer than about 20k base pairs ( bp ) , beyond which the length dependence of the mobility gradually disappears .",
    "pulsed - field electrophoresis has been widely used for separation of longer dna molecules .",
    "this method also has a limit , both with respect to speed and the size , with an upper limit about 10 mbp .    on the other hand ,",
    "separation devices are required to incorporate into a mili - meter size chip with the developments of highly integrated bioanalysis systems  the so called micro total analysis systems ( @xmath0-tas ) or lab - on - a - chip devices @xcite .",
    "however introducing gels into microchannels may be a difficult problem .",
    "gel - free separation techniques @xcite therefore have been proposed recently and attracted considerable amount of attention .",
    "ajdari and prost proposed a gel - free separation technique which uses free - flow electrophoresis together with a series of trapping by induced - dipole forces @xcite .",
    "they argued from their theoretical analysis that , in their model , the mobility of a dna chain monotonically decreases with its size .",
    "more recently , han and craighead have been investigated a designed microchannel ( entropic trap arrays ) which has alternating thin and thick regions @xcite .",
    "they found that longer dna molecules trapped in the thick regions for shorter time .",
    "thus a shorter dna has lower mobility .",
    "this fact has been confirmed theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "we note that , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the free energy landscape of the above two systems are quite similar , the relation between mobility and dna size shows the clear contrast .",
    "this discrepancy may come from the fact that , to consider escape of dna chains from a electrode , ajdari and prost regarded the chain as a point particle .",
    "contrary , it is experimentally observed that when a dna molecule escapes from an entropic trap , the deformation of dna plays an important role @xcite .    in this paper , we revisit the ajdari and prost s model and investigate the mobility of dna chains along the channel , taking the deformation of dna molecule into account .",
    "our simulation verifies that longer dna is trapped for shorter time and the mobility suddenly increases when the chain exceeds a critical length .",
    "furthermore , we found that this critical chain length is strongly affected by the voltage applied across the electrodes .",
    "thus , we could adjust the regime in which the device well separates dna chains without changing the structure of the channel .",
    "these numerical insights will help us to design practical separation devices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ii",
    ", our separation device and the simulation model are descriced . in sec .",
    "iii.a , result of our simulation is discussed , and in sec .",
    "iii.b , a scaling analysis is presented and compared with the simulation . in section iv , we summarize our results .",
    "to our simulation , we adopt a bead - spring model , which represents a dna molecule as @xmath1 beads or monomers of diameter @xmath2 .",
    "neighboring beads are connected by harmonic springs with constant @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is distance between neighboring beads , @xmath6 the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 the temperature . to take the excluded volume effect into account ,",
    "all beads interact each other with a weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential @xmath8 where @xmath5 is the inter - beads distance .",
    "let us write the thermal fluctuation force acts on the @xmath9th bead as @xmath10 .",
    "we suppose that the viscous drag is proportional to the bead velocity with friction constant @xmath11 .",
    "a general theorem from statistical mechanics relates the random force and the friction constant as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath14 identity tensor , @xmath15 the kronecker delta and @xmath16 the delta function .",
    "the random force in our simulation is set so as to satisfy this relation in a discretized manner .",
    "schematic views in @xmath17-plane and @xmath18-plane of the channel are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] .",
    "we simulate the motion of beads - spring chains inside this channel whose cross - section is a square with side @xmath19 . for @xmath20 direction , periodic boundary condition with distance @xmath21 is assumed both for the electric field and the chain motion unless mentioned particularly .",
    "we assume that the beads do not adhere to the channel s wall ; the wca potential also applied between the beads and the wall . in the corners ,",
    "the two repulsive forces come from different directions are summed up .",
    "each bead carries a electric charge @xmath22 . for strongly charged polyelectrolytes such as dna molecules ,",
    "the charge @xmath22 should be regarded as the renormalized one due to the counterion condensation . according to the oosawa - maining theory @xcite , the charge of dna , immersed in monovalent salt ,",
    "is neutralized by @xmath23 .",
    "hence we set , for the bead represents @xmath24 base pairs , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is elementary electric charge ) .",
    "next we describe electric trapping of dna molecules . a charged particle in solution is readily polarized by external electric field due to the cloud of counterions and the charge itself . in the presence of oscillating electric field",
    "@xmath27 , the polarization energy of this particle could be written as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 as polarizability .",
    "this energy gives force @xmath30 , which drives the particles toward the regions of stronger field amplitude .",
    "some experiments confirmed that the trapping of dna in the strongest field amplitude could occur over the range of frequency 1hz @xmath31 1khz @xcite .",
    "ajdari and prost theoretically considered the one - dimensional motion of a dna molecule dragged by an static electric field .",
    "an ac electric field is applied perpendicular to the direction of dna migration . in their model",
    ", it is assumed that the frequency is high enough and so that the molecule feel a ratchet like potential @xmath32 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratchet ] . in our simulation , we set  parallel - plate condensers \" along the channel as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] and apply dc voltage across them .",
    "we also apply an uniform electric field @xmath33 in @xmath20-direction , which drives the dna chain along the channel .",
    "the potential @xmath34 inside the channel is obtained by solving the laplace equation @xmath35 with the boundary element method under the boundary conditions of @xmath36 on the electrodes and @xmath37 on the other wall , where @xmath38 is the surface normal .",
    "the potential @xmath34 obtained is approximately equivalent to the @xmath32 in @xmath20 direction .",
    "the electric force acts on a bead is given as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is position of @xmath9-th bead .",
    "neglecting inertia , we write the equation of motion for @xmath9-th bead as @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents sum of the bead - bead and bead - wall interactions .",
    "the natural units of our simulation are defined as follows ; we use @xmath2 as the unit length , @xmath43 as the unit energy , @xmath44 as the unit electric field strength and @xmath45 as the unit time . the channel size @xmath46 .",
    "the spring constant @xmath3 is set to @xmath47 , in which condition the equilibrium length of the springs would be @xmath48 and no chain crossing occurs @xcite .",
    "we integrated the eq .",

    "we used mersenne twister algorithms@xcite to generate @xmath51 .",
    "initial conformation of a chain is set by putting beads with interval @xmath2 on a trajectory obtained from self - avoiding random walk .",
    "finally , we mention how the parameters of our model can be related to those of an experiments .",
    "we first regard @xmath53 , order of the persistence length of dna@xcite , then one bead corresponds to @xmath54 base pairs . the electric field",

    "the present model neglects the effect of conterions and hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "adequacy of the simplifications were precisely discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this model has been successfully described the migration of dna in gel @xcite and in a channel with entropic traps @xcite .",
    "we hence consider that the model may reproduce experimental results qualitatively and could fit to experimental results with a few adjustable parameters .",
    "in this subsection , we show the results of our simulation for dna migration in the microchannel . here",
    "we set @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the unit vector parallel to the @xmath20 axis , and describe the applied voltage across each electrode with a dimensionless parameter @xmath62 the number of beads ranges from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , which corresponds to dna molecules from @xmath65 to @xmath66 kbp .",
    "we focus on a dimensionless mobility @xmath67 of a single isolated chain as a function of @xmath68 and @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : snap ] shows the snapshots of our simulation , in which a chain of @xmath69 escapes from an electric trap under the conditions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we observe that the chain is stretched during the migration to the next trap .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] shows trajectories for chains of length @xmath72 at @xmath70 .",
    "the flat regions of the trajectories indicate the trapping of chains on a electrode .",
    "shorter chains tend to be trapped for longer time and longer chains only slightly affected by the traps . to evaluate mobility",
    ", we fit the trajectory of which the chain has passed through a trap 10 times , by a linear function .",
    "this slope is the dimensionless mobility @xmath73 .",
    "we show the relation between @xmath73 and @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobi ] .",
    "each plot is the average of 10 trials . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the mobility @xmath75 gently increases and for @xmath76 a sharp increase of mobility appears . in the case of @xmath77 short chains less than @xmath78",
    "are permanently trapped on a electrode and the resultant mobility would be zero . in the migration of long chains @xmath79 under the condition of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we observe that the mobility again rises .",
    "this is because the chain is stretched two or three times longer than the space between adjacent electrodes and the trapping by electrodes would be less efficient . in this regime ,",
    "to obtain the theoretical understanding in the mobility is not easy .",
    "thus this would be our future work . in the following subsection",
    ", we consider the dynamics of dna chains trapped by only one electrode .",
    "the microchannel could be efficient at separating dna molecules in region where mobility @xmath73 sharply depends on chain length .",
    "let us write the critical chain length as @xmath83 , at which the mobility shows the sudden increase .",
    "figure [ fig : mobi ] suggests that , by varying @xmath68 , we can  regurate \" the microchannel for the dna moleucles we try to separate . in the following ,",
    "we hence consider the relation between @xmath82 and @xmath68 .",
    "let us write a trapping lifetime of dna chains as @xmath84 .",
    "the dimensionless mobility could be written as @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the transit time between two adjacent electrodes .",
    "figure [ fig : theor_view](a ) is a schematic view of a bead - spring chain trapped on a electrode , in which @xmath87 beads of the chain have overcome a electric barrier @xmath88 .",
    "each bead experiences the ratchet like potential @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theor_view](b ) , where we set @xmath89 . to calculate trapping life time @xmath90",
    ", we roughly estimate total free energy difference @xmath91 due to the escape of @xmath92 beads .",
    "let @xmath93 and @xmath94 be the typical sizes of a  blob \" trapped on a electrodes .",
    "these two could be given by @xcite @xmath95 unfortunately , we can not analytically calculate the exponents @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "however , if we neglect the side walls at @xmath98 and @xmath19 , our simulation evaluates @xmath99 and @xmath100 . using the lengthes @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ", we can roughly estimate the electric potential energy of a blob trapped on a electrode @xmath103 as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is constant . when @xmath92 beads have overcome a barrier @xmath88 , the whole chain gains potential energy @xmath106 and loses @xmath107 as the @xmath92 beads go down the slope .",
    "the potential energy of the chain therefore could be written as @xmath108 where @xmath109 . because the increase of entropic free energy is proportional to @xmath110 , the total free energy difference @xmath91 is given by @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ fig : theor_view](b ) , we plot @xmath91 as a function of ratio @xmath112 .",
    "for @xmath113 the @xmath91 increases at a small @xmath92 and reaches a peak at @xmath114 , while for @xmath115 it monotonically decreases with @xmath92 .",

    "trapping occurs when @xmath117 , and @xmath90 is given by @xmath118 we can calculate @xmath116 by solving the following equation @xmath119 here we assume that number of beads @xmath1 is large enough , and neglect the order @xmath120 and the higher terms .",
    "then we obtain @xmath121 the sharp increase of @xmath122 appears when the free energy barrier @xmath123 . from fig.[fig : theor_view](b ) , we know that this condition occurs only when @xmath124 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath125 with @xmath105 as a fitting parameter .",
    "to estimate the value of @xmath83 from simulation data , we adopted the following procedure : first , we obtained the maximum and minimum mobility ( @xmath126 ) for a fixed @xmath68 in region @xmath127 .",
    "we write number of beads @xmath128 with this length the simulation gives mobility @xmath129 .",
    "figure [ fig : n_c ] shows that eq .",
    "( [ eq : theon ] ) is in good agreement with @xmath128 with one adjustable parameter @xmath130 .",
    "we have presented brownian dynamics simulations of dna migration in channels with electric trappings .",
    "the chain length dependence of mobility observed in our simulation does not agree with the theory presented by ajdari and prost @xcite .",
    "we conclude that this discrepancy is due to their simplification , in which dna molecules escapes from electric traps as a point particle , because our numerical simulations demonstrated that the deformation of dna chain plays an important role when it escapes from the traps .",
    "furthermore , the critical chain length @xmath83 is strongly affected by the voltage applied across the electrodes . from the rough consideration , we found a simple scaling relation between @xmath83 and the parameters of the present system , which agrees with simulations with one adjustable parameters .",
