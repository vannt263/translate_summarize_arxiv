    "the statistical behaviour of a spatially inhomogeneous classical fluid ( as is the case of the interface between two coexisting bulk phases or that of a fluid in a confined geometry ) is best analysed within the ( classical ) density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the dft method is widely recognized as being one of the most accurate theoretical tools in statistical mechanics , as also proved by the increasing number of applications in the scientific literature  @xcite .    generally speaking , the dft provides a functional relation between the thermodynamic grand potential of the system and its local - density profile @xmath0 . in practice ,",
    "the exact relation is not known and one must resort to approximations : typically , good thermodynamic properties of the solid phase are obtained by using only the structural properties of the fluid phase as input .",
    "for instance , in the so called `` weighted - density approximation '' ( wda )  @xcite , one maps the free energy @xmath1 $ ] of the inhomogeneous system onto the free energy of a fluid with a smoothed density @xmath2 , which is related in a non - local way to @xmath0 .",
    "another popular dft is the fundamental - measure theory ( fmt )  @xcite which , by enforcing dimensional crossover , provides the best theory invented so far for the hard - sphere solid  @xcite .",
    "recently , the fmt has been extended to hard - core lattice gases by lafuente and cuesta  @xcite and to soft - repulsive systems by schmidt  @xcite .",
    "while both the wda and the fmt work pretty well for purely repulsive systems , they must at present be used in tandem with perturbation theory when the interaction between particles has an attractive component as well  @xcite . in this case",
    ", however , there is no guarantee that the dft answer will be accurate .",
    "recently , i have carried out ( together with p. v. giaquinta ) a wda study  @xcite of a lattice - gas system with a realistic phase diagram ( _ i.e. _ , one hosting a solid , a liquid , and a vapour phase )  @xcite , showing the effectiveness of the dft method also for lattice problems .",
    "however , the theory of ref.@xcite uses different prescriptions , in the solid and in the fluid phase , for the contribution of the interparticle attraction to the free energy , and this may represent a serious limitation if one is planning to use the same density functional of the bulk also for the interface problem .",
    "in particular , an interesting situation to analyse would be that of the solid - vapour interface at a temperature being only slightly below the triple - point temperature . in this case",
    ", the melting of the surface usually takes place , with the appearance of a thin liquid layer right at the interface ( a successful dft of this phenomenon for the 3d continuum case can be found in @xcite ) . as a matter of fact , we were not able to provide in @xcite a sharp evidence of the surface melting since this would rather require that the analytic form of the ( approximate ) grand potential of the system be unique for all phases .",
    "in the present paper , i develop such a unique density functional for the same lattice model as in ref.@xcite by the inclusion of a convenient square - gradient term .",
    "in particular , the new theory leads to a genuine triple point when treating the interparticle attraction as a mean field , thus being a natural candidate for a practical demonstration of the surface - melting phenomenon in a lattice system . the toll of introducing an adjustable parameter into the theory ( which , as a result , partly loses contact with the original model ) is fully compensated by the gain of a density functional which shares with the exact unknown one a three - minima structure in the triple - point region .",
    "it comes as a surprise , however , that this is not sufficient to produce an ordinary surface melting .",
    "in fact , an unphysical periodic phase ",
    "an artefact of the theory  is unexpectedly found to condense at the solid - vapour interface in place of the liquid . only by carrying out a suitably constrained minimization of the density functional , aimed at washing out the undesired spurious phase ,",
    "i finally succeed to obtain the first , at least to my knowledge , dft description of complete surface melting in a lattice system .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "after a brief outline , in section 2 , of the lattice dft , i describe my system and method in section 3 , while presenting results for the bulk and the solid surface in section 4 .",
    "finally , a summary of the main conclusions is given in section 5 .",
    "the lattice dft  @xcite is a general framework for describing the statistical properties of systems of lattice particles under the influence of a site - dependent external potential @xmath3 or in the presence of a self - sustained inhomogeneity ( _ e.g. _ the density modulation of a periodic solid ) .",
    "the statistical description is accomplished in terms of the temperature ( @xmath4 ) and chemical - potential ( @xmath5 ) evolution of the local density @xmath6 , a grand - canonical average of the occupation number @xmath7 of site @xmath8 in the lattice .",
    "@xmath9 is a lattice field which , by the hohenberg - kohn - mermin ( hkm ) theorem , is in a one - to - one correspondence with the external field @xmath10 , allowing one to define the legendre transform @xmath1 $ ] of the grand potential @xmath11 with respect to the external field . @xmath1",

    "a minimum principle holds for ( [ eq01 ] ) , saying that @xmath15 $ ] attains its minimum for a density profile @xmath9 which is precisely the one determined by @xmath12 .",

    ", the details of the wda method can be found in ref.@xcite under the further simplifying hypothesis ( first considered by tarazona  @xcite ) of a weight function being a second - order polynomial in the density .",
    "the final step in the method is the calculation of the difference @xmath33 $ ] between the generalized grand potential of an inhomogeneous phase ( _ e.g. _ a crystalline solid ) and the fluid one , for equal values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "\\label{eq05}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after minimizing @xmath33 $ ] over the density field , the phase - coexistence condition is imposed by the vanishing of this minimum difference , which implies the same pressure for both phases .",
    "as a case - study for the surface melting , i shall take a _ two - dimensional _ ( 2d ) ( rather than 3d ) lattice - gas model with three phases . by this choice ,",
    "the forthcoming analysis of the interface problem gets substantially simplified .",
    "specifically , i consider the t345 model of ref.@xcite ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this is characterized by a hard - core interaction extending up to second - neighbor sites in the triangular lattice and a pair attraction ranging from third- to fifth - neighbor sites .",
    "the interaction strenghts are the same as in @xcite , namely @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "the maximum density allowed to this system is @xmath38 . the same model but with @xmath39 is called the t model .",
    "the role of the t model is that of a reference system since , in the following , the free energy of the inhomogeneous t345 system is going to be estimated through the perturbation - theory formula  @xcite @xmath40=f_0[n]+\\sum_{x < y}\\delta v(|x - y|)\\left < c_xc_y\\right > _ 0\\ , , \\label{eq06}\\ ] ] where the subscript 0 refers to the t model and @xmath41 is the departure of the t345 pair potential from the reference one ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath42 inside the core while @xmath43 outside ) .",
    "in particular , it is assumed by the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) that @xmath44 .    in ref.@xcite , an approximate dcf for the t fluid",
    "is obtained by solving the ornstein - zernike relation in the mean - spherical approximation ( msa ) .",
    "it turns out that this msa solution only exists for all fluid densities @xmath14 up to @xmath45 . beyond this threshold ,",
    "the profile of @xmath46 is extrapolated as a fourth - order polynomial in the density .",
    "the free energy of the inhomogeneous t system is expressed by the lattice counterpart of the wda .",
    "the further inclusion of the mean - field attraction leads eventually to a density functional for the t345 model which , however , turns out to be insufficient to produce a liquid basin in the phase diagram  @xcite . in particular , the value of the freezing density at the critical - point temperature happens to be too small . to overcome this problem , one solution could be to modify the mean - field functional in such a way as to shift the freezing line upward in density , while leaving unaltered the liquid - vapour coexistence locus .",
    "to this aim , a simple square - gradient ( sg ) correction is certainly effective : it delays the appearance of the solid phase , thus indirectly promoting the fluid phase .",
    "in fact , the sg term has a long tradition , appearing in many popular phenomenological theories of the interface structure  @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "a general plausibility argument for the sg correction can be provided , at least in case of a density field which is slowly - varying in space . as discussed in appendix a , the leading terms in the exact perturbative expansion of the excess free energy around a uniform density profile are a lda free energy plus a sg term . however , finding out a direct link between this term and the microscopic - model parameters is a hard problem ( see , however , appendix a ) .",
    "in fact , an even more difficult task could be to present a theoretical justification , within the perturbation theory , for the appearance of a sg correction _ near _ the mean - field attraction .",
    "in particular , including a sg correction into the mean - field functional might lead to overcounting some of the contributions to the free energy .",
    "however , if our concern is mainly to formulate a phenomenological dft theory of surface melting , rather than reproducing a specific model phase diagram , the above objection is only of minor significance .",
    "anyway , an _ ad hoc _ effective sg correction can always be regarded as just renormalizing the mean - field free energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , as a means for healing the crudeness of the mean - field attraction by taking into account at least part of the higher - order perturbative corrections .",
    "hence , it makes sense to examine the following form of free energy : @xmath47=\\sum_x\\left [ n_x\\ln n_x+(1-n_x)\\ln(1-n_x)\\right ] + \\sum_xn_x\\beta f_0^{\\rm exc}(\\bar{n}_x ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\lo+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{x,\\,y}\\beta\\delta v(|x - y|)n_xn_y+ \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_x\\beta j(n_x)\\sum_{\\delta}(n_x - n_{x+\\delta})^2\\ , , \\label{eq07}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 denotes a nearest - neighbor direction and @xmath49 is , at the moment , a still unspecified function of the density and , possibly , also of the temperature . in the spirit of an _ entirely _ phenomenological approach , the virtue of ( [ eq07 ] ) is to account for the main features of the t345 phase diagram , see section 4.1 ; then , the same theory will be asked to provide also a sound description of the surface - melting phenomenon .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "a constant value @xmath50 is assumed for @xmath51 . with this choice ,",
    "the dft free energy of the t345 system in units of @xmath52 becomes equal , in the infinite - temperature , @xmath53 limit , to the wda free energy of the t system in the same units ( _ i.e. _ , the first two terms on the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq07 ] ) ) . moreover ,",
    "note that the functional of the t model is not influenced by the sg term in eq.([eq07 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath54 follows after arbitrarily fixing the triple - point density or temperature ( see the next section ) .    in the homogeneous limit , eq.([eq07 ] ) gives a generalized grand potential of @xmath55 @xmath56 being the coordination number of the @xmath57-th lattice shell .",
    "the chemical - potential value that makes ( [ eq08 ] ) stationary with respect to @xmath14 is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the one - point dcf of the t model .",
    "it has been already discussed in ref.@xcite that the functional ( [ eq08 ] ) , with @xmath60 as in ( [ eq09 ] ) , shows two different minima at low temperature , whence two fluid phases exist , liquid and vapour , whose relative stability changes upon varying the density @xmath14 .",

    "first , i summarize the results of the wda theory for the t model . the coexisting fluid and solid densities",

    "the actual values , obtained through the grand - canonical monte carlo ( mc ) method  @xcite , are instead @xmath73 and @xmath74 , indicating that the thermodynamic stability of the t solid is overestimated by the theory .    moving to the attractive model , i first seek for the minimum of ( [ eq08 ] ) , with @xmath60 as in eq.([eq09 ] ) . for low enough values of the ( reduced ) temperature @xmath75 ,",
    "there are in fact two distinct points of minimum , the deeper one being associated with the thermodynamically stable phase .",
    "the locus of points @xmath76 where the two minima have equal depth is the liquid - vapour coexistence line ( the crosses in fig.2 ) .",
    "in particular , the critical point falls at @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "as far as the solid - fluid equilibrium is concerned , i first adjust the quantity @xmath54 so as to obtain a triple point at a selected temperature @xmath79 .",
    "it turns out that , in order for @xmath79 to be _",
    "e.g. _ exactly 0.7 , the value of @xmath54 in ( [ eq11 ] ) has to be 0.25191(1 ) . a bit larger value , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath80 , shifts the triple - point temperature down to 0.6 .",
    "the complete dft phase diagram of the t345 model is plotted in fig.2 for three values of @xmath54 , namely 0 ( mfa ) , 0.25191 ( @xmath81 ) , and 0.28214 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the mc simulation data of ref.@xcite are shown as asterisks .",
    "it clearly appears that the functional ( [ eq11 ] ) yields a realistic phase diagram only in a small window of @xmath54 values . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the predicted dft phase diagram was equally good ( fig.2 of @xcite , open circles ) , but we were obliged to use distinct dft functionals for the solid and the fluid . a minor defect of the present theory is the unphysically large ( @xmath83 ) value of the melting density at low temperature .",
    "in fact , though @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constrained to be smaller than 1 , their combination @xmath84 is not under control during the functional minimization . in any event , the agreement of the dft with mc remains mainly qualitative , also because of the not excellent quality of the wda theory for the reference t system .",
    "as already mentioned , the major advantage of ( [ eq11 ] ) over the functional considered in ref.@xcite lies in the fact that it has a unique expression for all phases of the system .",
    "this is evidenced _",
    "e.g. _ by its profile at the triple - point temperature : for @xmath85 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath81 ) , the three - minima structure of @xmath86 is shown in fig.3 , as projected onto the @xmath87 plane in the 3d space spanned by @xmath88 , and @xmath66 . upon moving away from the triple point , the relative depth of the minima changes , thus making a particular phase of the system more stable than the others .      a density functional with three minima , like that at eq.([eq11 ] ) , gives the rather unique opportunity to describe on an equal footing , _",
    "i.e. _ , within the same theoretical framework , both the bulk and the surface statistical properties of a many - particle system . among these , a prominent place is certainly held by the surface - melting phenomenon , which opens a sort of imaginary window on the structure of the underlying generalized grand potential : roughly speaking , it is the liquid state claiming visibility before thermodynamics gives its allowance .",
    "let me consider , for instance , a linear interface running along a nearest - neighbor direction , called @xmath89 .",
    "this interface breaks the translational symmetry along the perpendicular , vertical direction @xmath90 , thus causing the sublattice densities to get a @xmath90 dependence . very far from the interface , the densities",
    "recover the bulk values , being those of the solid for _ e.g. _ @xmath91 and those of the coexisting vapour for @xmath92 .",
    "the horizontal layers are labelled with an index @xmath93 , which increases upon going from solid to vapour , being zero at the `` centre '' of the interface . to be specific ,",
    "those layers where particles are preferentially hosted in the solid have an odd @xmath93 value . at variance with the bulk case ,",

    ", this effect is mimicked through the introduction of an effective repulsion between the two interfaces .",
    "furthermore , while @xmath126 shows only a small dependence on temperature , the increase of @xmath119 with @xmath111 is more conspicuous , being @xmath127 , and @xmath128 for the above cited @xmath111 values .",

    "i have used the lattice analogue of the perturbative dft in order to analyse the phase behaviour and the interface structure of a 2d lattice - gas model with a pair interaction consisting of a hard core plus an attractive tail . from previous studies ,",
    "this model is known to exhibit a solid , a liquid , and a vapour phase .    in order to obtain a phase diagram with three phases ,",
    "i have considered a phenomenological density functional which , besides treating the interparticle attraction as a mean field , also contains a tunable square - gradient correction .",
    "in fact , the very unique request to this theory was to yield a generalized grand potential for an inhomogeneous phase that could exactly turn , in the homogeneous limit , into the fluid functional .",
    "this requirement is crucial for getting a consistent description of the interface between the solid and a fluid phase .    after producing a good theory for the bulk",
    ", i have adapted the same density functional to the geometry of a solid - vapour interface .",
    "the aim was to observe , under equilibrium conditions , the melting of the solid surface , _ i.e. _ , the growth of a liquid layer between the solid and the vapour as the triple point is approached from low temperature .    surprisingly , the minimization of the interface functional unveils instead a periodic phase which is totally unphysical , being actually an artefact of the theory . in order to recover a more conventional behaviour ,",
    "i have carried out a constrained functional minimization which , while not affecting the liquid , makes it unlikely for more exotic phases to appear . by this stratagem , and nothwistanding the partial arbitrariness that is implicit in such a conditioned minimization , in the end i arrive at a fairly realistic description of the complete surface melting of a lattice system  a result which , in my opinion , is an interesting illustrative example of the risks which may accompany the use of a phenomenological dft functional .",
    "anyway , i do not think that the _ ad hoc _ expedient that was considered here can be of help for investigating , in the absence of a good - quality functional , more delicate features like _",
    "e.g. _ layering phase transitions and roughening .",

    "i take the fourier transform of a lattice field @xmath138 to be @xmath139 ( see the precise definition of the @xmath140 vectors in ref.17 of @xcite ) .",

    "for instance , one can require that , besides being small , @xmath150 also varies slowly in space .",
    "in this case , only the long - wavelength fourier components of @xmath150 are important , implying that what really matters in fact is the matching of the above two quantities in the small-@xmath140 limit . in particular",
    ", the lda free energy ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath151 ) does exactly reproduce only the @xmath152 fourier component in eq.([a07 ] ) , since @xmath153 .    at second order in @xmath140 , @xmath154 the first term @xmath155 .",
    "the second term is zero for a lattice with inversion symmetry ( _ i.e. _ , one with @xmath156 ) .",
    "the third term is : @xmath157 having denoted unit vectors by a hat .",
    "observe that , in the last step , the axial symmetry of the lattice with respect to each coordinate axis has been assumed .",
    "hence , the expansion of @xmath149 in powers of @xmath140 begins as @xmath158 .    since @xmath159 for a hypercubic lattice ,",
    "the expression of @xmath51 for this lattice is : @xmath160 for a triangular lattice , @xmath161 while @xmath162 is like in eq.([a09 ] ) with @xmath163 .",
    "hence , @xmath51 is still given by eq.([a10 ] ) , but with @xmath164 ( the rationale being that , for the triangular lattice , the nearest - neighbor sites are six , like for the cubic lattice ) .",
    "to conclude , i make some comments on the result ( [ a10 ] ) . for the t model , the non - zero",
