    "it has recently been proposed that it may be possible to observe neutral atomic hydrogen gas during the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , in absorption against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in its 3-cm fine - structure line ( @xmath4 , * ? ? ? * hereafter s07 ) .",
    "the possible detectability of the 3-cm line derives from the fact that the 2s state of atomic hydrogen is metastable @xcite .",
    "that is , the average lifetime of an undisturbed atom in the 2s - state is @xmath9 s , after which it decays into the 1s state by emitting 2 photons @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the mean life - time of atoms in the 2p state is @xmath10 s. hence , when atoms are excited into their 2s and 2p states at comparable rates , the 2s level is expected to be highly overpopulated relative to the 2p level .",
    "this may result in a non - negligible optical depth in the @xmath11 fine - structure line ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the detectability of this line has been discussed in the context of hii regions in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for a more detailed discussion ) . in local hii regions ,",
    "the 2s level is populated mainly following recombination , while both recombination and photoexcitation by ly@xmath12 photons populate the 2p state .",
    "the ly@xmath12 excitation rate of the 2p - state is limited by dust , and the 2s - state is typically heavily overpopulated in hii regions which result in 3-cm optical depths of order @xmath13 ( ershov 1987 ; dennison et al , 2005 , where the absorption is measured relative to the free - free continuum that is produced in the hii region ) .",
    "s07 have argued that during the eor , bright quasars that are luminous in the restframe soft - uv ( 10.2 ev @xmath14 13.6 ev ) may indirectly photoexcite the 2s state of neutral hydrogen gas in the low density intergalactic medium to levels such that @xmath15 for cmb photons passing through these regions levels of atomic hydrogen can produce a detectable opacity .",
    "one can estimate @xmath16 by comparing it to the gunn - peterson optical depth @xmath17 : @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath20 a few times @xmath21 for a fully neutral igm at @xmath22 , @xmath23 only requires that @xmath24 . it will be shown in   [ sec : sim ] that these levels can be reached in regions around high - redshift quasars . ] .",
    "absorption of these cmb photons would result in an absorption feature with a brightness temperature of a few tens of @xmath6k at @xmath25 ghz , which may be detectable with existing dish antennas such as the _ green bank telescope _ ( gbt ) , _ parkes _ and the most compact configuration of the _ australia telescope compact array _ ( atca , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this result is important , because it implies that neutral intergalactic atomic hydrogen gas that exists during eor may reveal itself in a line that is different ( and possibly easier to detect ) than the well studied 21-cm hyperfine transition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we re - analyze the detectability of the fine - structure line during the eor .",
    "we perform more detailed modeling of the transfer of ly@xmath26 radiation than originally discussed by s07",
    ". we will show that ( unfortunately ) proper modeling of ly@xmath26 ( and ly@xmath27 ) radiative transfer radically lowers the value of @xmath16 to levels that can not be probed with existing radio telescopes .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we review the dominant excitation mechanisms of the 2s and 2p levels in  [ sec : mech ] . in  [ sec : ex ] , we compute the effective excitation rate of the 2s - state during the eor , by properly accounting for radiative transfer , and discuss the detectability of the 3-cm fine - structure line in  [ sec : detection ] . the validity of our model assumptions , and the implications of this work are discussed in  [ sec : discuss ] . finally , we present the conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] .",

    "atoms can be excited out of the ground state through the following processes : ( _ i _ ) collisional excitation , ( _ ii _ ) recombination following photoionization or collisional ionization , and ( _ iii _ ) photoexcitation .",
    "following s07 , processes ( _ i - ii _ ) are ignored ( see   [ sec : sim ] - under roman numeral i -for a more detailed motivation ) .",
    "the quantum mechanical selection rules state that the only atomic transitions that are allowed by emitting or absorbing a photon are those in which @xmath39 changes by @xmath40 .",
    "hence , absorption only results in transitions of the form @xmath41 , while subsequent emission only results in @xmath42 .",
    "the allowed transitions among the first 3 levels of the h - atom are indicated in figure  [ fig : diagram ] as _ dotted lines_. in a 3-level atom ( the impact of using a multilevel atom is discussed in   [ sec : sim ] under roman numeral ii ) the selection rules only allow the 2s state to be populated by absorbing a ly@xmath26 photon , and by subsequently emitting an h@xmath12 photon .",
    "hence , the level population of atoms in the 2s state is determined by the _",
    "effective ly@xmath26 scattering rate _ , denoted by @xmath43 , which is defined as the rate at which ly@xmath26 photons absorbed , and subsequently converted into h@xmath12 + 2 continuum photons .",
    "this rate is lower than to the `` ordinary '' ly@xmath26 scattering rate , @xmath44 , which is the rate at which ly@xmath26 photons are absorbed .",
    "as mentioned above , the effective ly@xmath26 scattering rate , @xmath45 , is crucial in calculating the number of atoms in the 2s - state .",
    "the goal of this section is to evaluate @xmath46 . in   [ sec : mc ] we describe the monte - carlo technique that was used to compute the general and effective ly@xmath26 scattering rates , and in   [ sec : result ] we present our results .",
    "we compute the general and effective ly@xmath26 scattering rate by performing monte - carlo ( mc ) calculation of the ly@xmath26 radiative transfer in the neutral gas surrounding a spherical hii region of radius @xmath47 mpc , that is based on the physical size of the hii region that possibly exist around @xmath22 quasars ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "a photon is emitted with a frequency that is drawn randomly from the range @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "the transfer calculation therefore focuses on photons in a frequency range @xmath49 centered on @xmath50 , similar to the optically thin calculation that was originally performed by s07 ( and which is discussed in appendix  [ sec : lya1 ] ) .",
    "the photon propagates an optical depth @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "the optical depth translates to a physical distance via @xmath53)$ ] .",
    "each time a ly@xmath26 photon is absorbed , there is a @xmath54 probability for the atom to decay directly back to the ground state by emitting a ly@xmath26 photon @xcite .",
    "this is simulated in the mc - calculation by generating a random number @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the photon scatters as a ly@xmath26 photon if @xmath56 , in which case a new direction is chosen and we return to step * 2*. on the other hand , a transition of the form @xmath57 occurs when @xmath58 .",
    "after this process , the ly@xmath26 photon is destroyed , and we return to step * 1.*.    we compute total ly@xmath26 scattering rate by keeping track of the number of scattering events that occur in shell @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( in the mc - simulation , the gas is sampled by a discrete number of gas shells , see dijkstra et al 2006 ) . the total ly@xmath26 scattering rate transfer in shell @xmath59 follows from @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the total rate at which the quasar is emitting photons in the frequency range @xmath48 $ ] ( we have assumed @xmath63 s@xmath64 to compare to s07 as closely as possible ) , @xmath65 is the total number of hydrogen atoms in shell @xmath59 , and where @xmath66 is the total number of photons that is used in the mc - simulation . the effective ly@xmath26 scattering rate is obtained similarly from @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the total number of scattering events of the sequence @xmath69 in shell @xmath59 .",
    "the general and effective ly@xmath26 scattering rates we obtain from the monte - carlo calculation are shown in figure  [ fig : lybscatrate ] as the _ black _ and _ red solid histograms _ , respectively .",
    "the _ blue dotted line _ shows the scattering rate that is obtained when the gas is assumed to be optically thin ( which corresponds to the original calculation of s07 , see appendix [ sec : lya1 ] for more details ) .",
    "furthermore , the _ blue dashed line _ shows the scattering rate that one obtains if one ignores that ly@xmath26 photons undergo multiple scattering events , and simply suppresses the incoming ly@xmath26 flux by a factor of e@xmath70 ( this calculation is described in appendix [ sec : noscat ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lybscatrate ] shows that the effective ly@xmath26 scattering rate is much lower than the rate that is obtained in the optically thin calculation . at small distances into the hi region ( @xmath71 kpc , which is shown in the inset ) ,",
    "the effective scattering rate is @xmath72 s@xmath64 .",
    "the effective scattering rate decreases rapidly with radius , and levels off at a level that is @xmath73 orders of magnitude smaller than the rate one obtains from the optically thin calculation .",
    "this rapid decrease owes to the large line - center optical depth of the neutral igm to ly@xmath26 photons , which causes resonant scattering only to occur near the edge of the hii region .",
    "this point is illustrated by the _ green dotted line _ in the main plot of figure  [ fig : lybscatrate ] , which shows the scattering rate of photons with frequencies such that they would have redshifted into resonance at @xmath74 mpc ( i.e. 3 mpc into the neutral igm ) . when these photons reach @xmath75 mpc , they find themselves @xmath76 km s@xmath64 blueward of the resonance , and their absorption cross - section is suppressed by a factor of @xmath77 relative to the resonance absorption cross - section .",
    "the scattering rate of these photons is therefore also suppressed by a factor of @xmath78 ( relative to the optically thin rates ) .",
    "the scattering rate increases rapidly with radius as the photons redshift closer to resonance , and the maximum scattering rate occurs at @xmath79 mpc , where the photons have redshifted to within @xmath80 doppler widths from resonance .",
    "the optical depth of the igm increases rapidly as these photons redshift closer to resonance , which results in a sharp cut - off in the scattering rate at @xmath81 mpc .",
    "in other words , photons that were emitted somewhat blueward of the ly@xmath26 resonance frequency -which need to travel far into neutral gas from the hii region edge before redshifting into the line center- have a high probability of being absorbed in the damping wing of the line , and do not generally make it to line center .",
    "the absorption cross section in the damping wing is low compared to that at line center , and so these photons yield a correspondingly small scattering rate",
    ". therefore the ly@xmath26 scattering rates are strongly suppressed at @xmath82 kpc , i.e. photons are conserved . on the other hand , @xmath83 in the optically thin limit (  [ sec : lya1 ] ) .",
    "each emitted ly@xmath26 photon can only undergo one effective scattering event , and the total effective scattering rate can never exceed the total rate at which ly@xmath26 photons are emitted .",
    "the optically thin calculation is therefore logically inconsistent . ] .",
    "the sharp cut - off of the effective ly@xmath26 scattering rate is also discussed in appendix [ sec : noscat ] .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ fig : lybscatrate ] shows that the effective scattering rate that is extracted from the mc - simulation ( _ red solid histogram _ ) is well reproduced by the model in which the mean ly@xmath26 intensity is suppressed by a factor of e@xmath70 ( the _ blue dashed line _ ) .",
    "the reason for this is that each ly@xmath26 photon can only excite 1 atom into the 2s state : each time a transition of the from @xmath84 occurs , the ly@xmath26 photon is lost permanently .",
    "this almost corresponds to a calculation in which one ignores scattering and simply suppresses the intensity with a factor e@xmath70 .",
    "the only difference is that ly@xmath26 photons typically scatter @xmath85 times before being converted into h@xmath12 + 2 continuum photons .",
    "the random walk associated with the scattering process transports the ly@xmath26 photons on average @xmath86 mean free paths through the neutral igm , before indirectly exciting an atom into its 2s - state .",
    "in practise , this introduces a difference with the scattering rate obtained from the e@xmath70-calculation only at the smallest separations from the edge of the hii region ( @xmath87 kpc , see inset ) . at these smallest radii ,",
    "the gas is optically thin to ly@xmath26 photons , and here the _",
    "ly@xmath26 scattering rate ( _ black solid histogram _ ) as extracted from the mc - simulation agrees best with the analytic solution given by eq  ( [ eq : pscat2 ] ) with @xmath88 .",
    "naturally , here the _ effective _ scattering rate is suppressed by a factor of @xmath89 .",
    "the change in brightness temperature for cmb radiation passing through the neutral gas with an enhanced population of atoms in the 2s - state is given by    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the cmb temperature at redshift @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the excitation temperature of the 2s-2p transition , which is defined as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the standard source function ( see * ? ? ?",
