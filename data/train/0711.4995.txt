    "galaxies in the distant universe were forming stars with much higher rates than today ( madau et al 1996 ; elbaz et al 2002 ; le floch et al . 2005 ) . for galaxies of a fixed stellar mass , e.g. of the order of @xmath10 , the typical star formation rate ( sfr )",
    "has been steadily increasing with respect to local values , up to @xmath11 times higher at @xmath12 ( daddi et al .",
    "2007a ; d07a hereafter ) .",
    "this increase can be accounted for either by postulating a higher gas content or a higher star formation efficiency , or both .",
    "galaxy mergers and interactions , expected to be much more common in the distant universe than today , can increase the density of gas in galaxies , and thus help transform gas into stars more rapidly and with a higher star formation efficiency .",
    "the relative importance for massive galaxy formation and assembly of the hierarchical merging of small sub galactic units , versus the in situ formation of stars through gas consumption is largely unknown observationally .",
    "the molecular gas content of galaxies is best probed through the detection of redshifted cooling emission lines of co. combining observations for local and distant galaxies , all the way from spirals to ( ultra ) luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath13 , and ulirgs , @xmath14 ) , a nonlinear correlation is observed ( e.g. , solomon & van den bout 2005 ) between co luminosity ( proportional to molecular gas content ) and fir luminosity ( proportional to the sfr ) , with more luminous sources having higher fir to co luminosities , i.e. higher efficiencies than spiral disks in converting gas into stars , likely due to their higher gas densities ( tacconi et al .",

    "[ fig : xco ] ) .",
    "instead , they lie close to a linear @xmath32 to @xmath48 relation normalized to local spirals . the observed ratio in the two massive @xmath24 galaxies is an order of magnitude lower than that of smgs at similar redshifts , implying much lower star formation efficiency .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that smgs are outliers of the mass - sfr correlation ( d07a ) , probably due to the higher efficiency in forming stars , for a similar stellar mass and co luminosity .",
    "the @xmath32 to @xmath48 ratios of the two @xmath24 galaxies are within the semi - interquartile range of values from local spirals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xco ] , right panel ) .",
    "no object with similar @xmath32 to @xmath48 ratio and large @xmath32 was previously known in the distant universe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xco ] ) .",
    "this implies that these distant bzk galaxies behave as _ scaled up",
    "_ versions of local spirals , with proportionally higher sfr and molecular gas content for a fixed galaxy stellar mass .",
    "we use a conversion rate ( kennicutt et al . 1998 ) @xmath49  [ @xmath29  yr@xmath3 ] , adapted to a chabrier ( 2003 ) stellar initial mass function and in the assumption , appropriate for these galaxies , that @xmath32 is about 80% of the bolometric luminosity . in general , we can write @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the total molecular gas mass ( including he ) and the conversion factor ( downes & solomon 1998 ; solomon & van den bout 2005 ) is @xmath53  @xmath29  ( k  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath4)@xmath3 for the milky way and as low as @xmath54  @xmath29  ( k  km  s@xmath3  pc@xmath4)@xmath3 for ulirgs and likely for smgs .",
    "the high detected co luminosities imply that giant molecular gas reservoirs are present , of order of @xmath55 , for a ulirg - like @xmath56 , comparable to smgs and larger than in local ulirgs .",
    "the typical gas consumption timescales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xco ] ) are about 24@xmath57  yr for smgs , a factor of @xmath58 larger for local ulirgs and reach 23@xmath59  yr for the massive @xmath24 galaxies at @xmath0 , in the case of @xmath56 .",
    "the sfr could last for even longer than that , as further gas accretion will be substantial during such long timescales .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations from keres et al .",
    "( 2005 ) predict gas accretion rates of about 10 - 70 @xmath29  yr@xmath3 for similarly massive galaxies at @xmath28 ( i.e. , for dark matter halo masses of @xmath60 ; hayashi et al 2007 ) .",
    "this is the same order of magnitude of the estimated sfr in massive @xmath61 galaxies .",
    "these are likely lower limits to the sfr duration and gas masses as we are entirely neglecting atomic gas .",
    "as the star formation efficiencies are consistent with those of local spirals , in analogy to the latter it might be that @xmath62 or even that the milky way conversion factor applies to these massive @xmath24 sources .",
    "this is further supported by the evidence that , unlike local ulirgs ( downes & solomon 1998 ) and distant smgs ( tacconi et al 2006 ) , these two @xmath24 galaxies , like @xmath63 massive star forming galaxies ( daddi et al 2004a ; bouche et al 2007 ) in general , are not compact merger - induced starbursts . from detailed srsic fitting of their uv rest frame light profiles from hubble space telescope imaging data obtained with advanced camera for surveys ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) , we derive half - light radii of 4.4 and 5.5  kpc ( proper size , or about 0.5@xmath64 , accurate to better than 5% ) .",
    "both galaxies have disk - like ( exponential ) morphology with srsic index @xmath65 and 0.6 ( accurate to better than 20% ) .",
    "bzk-4171 appears indeed as a nearly edge on disk , consistent with the srsic fitting .",
    "bzk-21000 has a clumpy structure , still consistent with a disk but also with the possible presence of minor merging events .",
    "the uv rest frame sizes are likely reasonably accurate measurements of the starbursts sizes , because for these sources reliable sfrs measurements can be obtained from the uv ( daddi et al 2005 ; d07a ; dannerbauer et al 2006 ; reddy et al 2005 ) , i.e. their uv emission is not entirely opaque , while local ulirgs and distant smgs are optically thick in the uv ( champan et al 2005 ; goldader et al 2002 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the evidence for extended co emission , at least for bzk-21000 .",
    "the inferred sizes are a factor of 2 - 3 larger than distant smgs ( tacconi et al 2006 ) and 10 times larger than local ulirgs ( downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "this converts into 12 order of magnitudes lower gas densities and justifies the relatively modest star formation efficiencies .",
    "independent estimates of the molecular gas masses and thus sfr timescales , can also be obtained .",
    "first , if we apply the schmidt - kennicutt law ( using its latest derivation from bouche et al 2007 , that includes also distant smgs ) , using the uv size for the typical gas and sfr size , we estimate @xmath66 for each galaxy .",
    "second , from the co velocity widths and ( uv and/or co ) size measurements of the galaxies we estimate dynamical masses of about 11.5@xmath34 , within the half light radii , including gas , stars and dark matter . given the estimated total stellar masses of @xmath670.8@xmath34 , roughly half of which presumably lying within the half - light radii , it looks plausible that @xmath68 of gas can be present . we conclude that it would take up to 1  gyr to consume all of the gas in these typical , massive high - redshift galaxies , assuming the star - formation rate remained roughly constant .",
    "clearly , the star formation episodes could last longer since additional gas is accreted over such long timescales .",
    "in order to evaluate the implications of these results for massive galaxy formation , recall that the two observed galaxies are representative of massive galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "they were selected for co observations simply due to the availability of known spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the two galaxies lie on the sfr to stellar mass correlation inferred at @xmath28 , and their colors and morphologies are fully typical of massive @xmath61 galaxies .",
    "star forming galaxies in that redshift range with similar stellar masses are common in the distant universe , with space densities of order of @xmath69  mpc@xmath9 , quite a bit larger than the @xmath70  mpc@xmath9 observed for smgs by chapman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . clearly , these results point to the existence of a much larger population of gas rich galaxies in the distant universe than previously thought .",
    "we notice that the far - ir luminosity estimates for our objects are based on the uv , radio and mid - ir luminosities , and are solid given that self - consistent measurements of sfr activity have been shown to be obtainable for these kind of objects at high redshift ( d07a ) .",
    "it is very unlikely that we are strongly underestimating their star formation activity ( which would lead us to overestimate the duration timescales ) . instead , the @xmath32 for smgs from greve et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is based only on the @xmath71 m flux and is likely more uncertain . using radio and spitzer , pope et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest lower @xmath32 for smgs .",
    "this could imply that smgs are closer in their sfr modes to massive @xmath24 galaxies , but would change little about our conclusion because it is the latter which represent the dominating star formation mode at high redshift .    the large molecular gas fraction in these galaxies , possibly up to 50% or more",
    ", would likely give rise to large scale instabilities , with the formation of clumps ( e.g. , immeli et al .",
    "2004 ; bournaud , elmegreen & elmegreen 2007 ) .",
    "this could explain the clumpy structure of these two galaxies , and in general of a large fraction of the high-@xmath1 massive galaxies ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "2004a ) , and the high velocity dispersions observed in many of the high-@xmath1 massive disk galaxies ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "2006 ; forster - schreiber et al .",
    "2006 ) .    the long duration timescale for star formation activity implies , as a corollary , long duration activity for the galactic nuclei . in fact",
    ", it has been recently unveiled by d07b that up to 20 - 50% of massive galaxies in @xmath28 likely contain strongly obscured but relatively luminous agns .",
    "some of the large gas reservoir is likely slowly funneled , in some way , into the central black hole with similar timescales to star formation , at a rate roughly consistent with what is required to assemble the correlation between stellar and black hole masses as we observe today ( d07b ) .",
    "our results underline the major role of gas consumption over long timescales and with low efficiencies , as opposed to rapid and strong merger driven bursts , as a major growth mode for both stellar mass and black holes in the distant universe .",
    "we thank roberto neri and arancha castro - carrizo for assistence with taking and reducing iram plateau de bure interferometer data .",
    "we acknowledge very useful discussions , at various stages of this work , with kartik sheth , frederic bournaud , pierre - alain duc and fabian walter .",
