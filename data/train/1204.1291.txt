    "wormholes are compact space - times with nontrivially topological interiors and topologically simple boundaries .",

    "one motivation in the treatment of wormhole physics was due to the results of morris , thorne , and yurtsever @xcite , which connected time machines and traversable wormholes .",

    "we used the effective gravitational field equations derived by shiromizu , maeda , and sasaki @xcite .",
    "as there are few satisfactory bulk solutions for compact objects in randall - sundrum scenarios , one alternative is to build geometries in the brane and invoke campbell - magaard theorems @xcite , which guarantees their extensions through the bulk ( locally at least ) .",
    "this approach has been used by several authors @xcite , and we will be following it in the present work .",
    "moreover , global regularity of the brane is expected to facilitate the construction of a regular bulk solution @xcite .",
    "this issue will be explored in the space - times constructed here .",
    "contrary to what has been suggested in the literature @xcite , we obtain de sitter solutions which are regular everywhere .",
    "the class of geometries studied here complement the asymptotically flat space - times treated in @xcite ; and the asymptotically anti - de sitter metrics in @xcite .",
    "we should mention that solutions of the effective einstein equations with positive cosmological constant in a brane setting were previously considered in @xcite .",
    "while there is some overlap between the present work and @xcite , we have explored some global issues not considered in the mentioned paper , such as regularity and the existence of cosmological horizons . as will be discussed ,",

    "this is a consistency check for the numerical results and an indication that the near extreme results are indeed adequate when the appropriate limit is taken .",
    "we illustrate this point in tables [ qnm_sc ] and [ qnm_grav ] .",
    "moreover , the analytical expression in eq.([qnm_pt_grav ] ) for the gravitational sector appears to work well even when the condition @xmath218 is not strictly satisfied , as suggested by the data presented , for example , in table [ qnm_grav ] .",
    "we have obtained a family of exact solutions of the effective einstein equations in a asymptotically de sitter randall - sundrum brane .",
    "this family includes naked singularities , but also solutions which describe wormholes .",
    "maximal extensions of the solutions were studied .",
    "we have shown that the extensions describe lorentzian , traversable , wormhole space - times which connect regions bounded by cosmological horizons .",
    "it should be noted that , although the existence of a local , asymptotically de sitter , solution for a metric in a randall - sumdrum scenario might be expected , it is not obvious that there would exist solutions regular everywhere .",
    "the explicit solutions constructed here have this characteristics .",
    "one basic requirement , if the geometries obtained are to be considered as physically relevant , is the stability of the derived geometries under first - order perturbations . we have treated this question here considering scalar and axial gravitational perturbations .",
    "an important result in the perturbative analysis performed in this work is that _ no unstable modes were found_.    moreover , the detailed numerical and analytical treatment presented sketches a picture of the perturbative dynamics .",
    "scalar spherically symmetric modes typically decay to a nonzero constant asymptotically .",
    "this is reminiscent of a feature already observed in considerations involving de sitter black holes @xcite .",
    "although oscillatory and nonoscillatory decays bounded by exponential envelopes were observed , no power - law tails appeared , which also resembles the dynamics around asymptotically de sitter black holes @xcite .    one interesting limit of the geometries derived in this work is their near extreme regime .",
    "this limit is interesting because the geometry becomes very simple , while still preserving the causal structure of the nonextreme case .",
    "in fact , in the near extreme regime the quasinormal spectra of the perturbations considered can be analytically determined , which is something not common in the literature . moreover , the comparison between the full numerical results and the near extreme approximation shows good agreement for the fundamental overtone .",
    "we consider this result a strong argument for the validation of both approaches . besides",
    ", the near extreme analytical results appear to describe reasonably well the gravitational quasinormal spectra even outside this limit .",
