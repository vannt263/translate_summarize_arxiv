    "in 1976 t hooft [ 1 ] observed that the standard model does not absolutely conserve baryon and lepton number due to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly . in particular",
    "t hooft considered spontaneous fermion number violation due to instanton transitions between topologically inequivalent vacua .",
    "fermion number violating tunnelling transitions at high energies might become observable at future accelerators [ 2,3 ] .    in 1983",
    "manton [ 4 ] considered the possibility of fermion number violation in the weak interactions from another point of view .",
    "he showed that there are non - contractible loops in configuration space and predicted the existence of a static , unstable solution of the field equations , a sphaleron [ 5 ] , representing the top of the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua .",
    "it is this interpretation of the sphaleron solution , which makes it physically relevant . at finite temperature",
    "the energy barrier between distinct vacua can be overcome due to thermal fluctuations of the fields , and vacuum to vacuum transitions can occur , accompanied by a change of baryon and lepton number .",
    "the rate for baryon number violating processes is largely determined by a boltzmann factor , containing the height of the barrier at a given temperature , and thus by the energy of the sphaleron [ 6 - 10 ] .",
    "in this letter we investigate the configuration space of the weinberg - salam theory further and construct multisphaleron solutions .",
    "in contrast to the sphaleron [ 5 ] , which is spherically symmetric for vanishing mixing angle , the multisphaleron solutions are only axially symmetric , even for vanishing mixing angle .",
    "the appropriate ansatz for the multisphalerons represents a generalization of the axially symmetric ansatz for the sphaleron at finite mixing angle [ 11,12 ] , preserving the invariance under parity .    like the multiinstantons the multisphalerons can be labelled by an integer @xmath1 , which is associated with the topological charge of these solutions",
    "this integer @xmath1 appears in the ansatz for the multisphalerons , representing a winding number with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath4 . while @xmath4 covers the full trigonometric circle once , the fields wind @xmath1 times around .",
    "the ansatz is thus analogous to the ansatz of manton [ 13 ] and rebbi and rossi [ 14 ] for multimonopole solutions of an su(2 ) gauge theory with a higgs triplet .    from the ansatz the energy functional and the equations of motion for the fields",
    "are obtained . considering only vanishing mixing angle ,",
    "the resulting system of coupled non - linear partial differential equations is solved numerically . for @xmath2 spherical symmetry and the well known sphaleron [ 5 ]",
    "are recovered .",
    "in section 2 we briefly review the weinberg - salam lagrangian , discuss the ansatz and present the resulting energy functional . in section 3",
    "we exhibit the multisphaleron solutions with @xmath5 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "let us consider the bosonic sector of the weinberg - salam theory @xmath6 with the su(2)@xmath7 field strength tensor @xmath8 with the u(1 ) field strength tensor @xmath9 and the covariant derivative for the higgs field @xmath10 the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath11 of the higgs field @xmath12 leading to the boson masses @xmath13 the mixing angle @xmath14 is determined by the relation @xmath15 , and the electric charge is @xmath16 .",
    "su(2 ) gauge field configurations can be classified by a charge , the chern - simons charge .",
    "the chern - simons current @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) is not conserved , its divergence @xmath20 represents the su(2 ) part of the u(1 ) anomaly of the baryon current .",
    "the chern - simons charge of a configuration is given by @xmath21 for the vacua the chern - simons charge is identical to the integer winding number , while the sphaleron has a chern - simons charge of 1/2 [ 5 ] .",
    "let us now consider the ansatz for the multisphaleron solutions .",
    "following manton[13 ] and rebbi and rossi [ 14 ] we define a set of orthonormal vectors @xmath22 and expand the fields as follows @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 invariance under rotations about the @xmath26-axis and under parity leads to the conditions [ 11,12 ] @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29    the resulting axially symmetric energy functional @xmath30 @xmath31 then has the contributions @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 it is still invariant under gauge transformations generated by @xmath35 analogous to [ 11 - 14 ] . note , that under this transformation the 2-d higgs doublets @xmath36 and @xmath37 transform with angle @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , while the 2-d gauge field @xmath40 transforms inhomogeneously . here we fix this gauge degree of freedom by choosing the gauge condition [ 11,12 ] @xmath41    changing to spherical coordinates and extracting the trivial @xmath42-dependence we specify the ansatz further [ 11,12 ] + @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 note , that the spherically symmetric ansatz for the sphaleron corresponds to @xmath2 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ( where the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspond to those of ref . [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the above ansatz , when inserted into the classical equations of motion in the chosen gauge , yields a set of coupled partial differential equations for the functions @xmath51 , to be solved numerically subject to certain boundary conditions . to obtain regular , finite energy solutions with the imposed symmetries , we take as boundary conditions for the functions @xmath51 @xmath52",
    "the chern - simons charge of the multisphaleron solutions can be evaluated analogously to the chern - simons charge of the sphaleron [ 5 ] . at spatial infinity",
    "the vector fields are pure gauge configurations @xmath53 with @xmath54 the proper gauge for evaluating the chern - simons charge is the gauge with @xmath55 at infinity , which is obtained with the transformation @xmath56 and @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the chern - simons charge of the multisphaleron solutions is then given by @xmath59 where the chern - simons density is determined by [ 15,16 ] @xmath60 since the derivative terms do not contribute ( because of the boundary conditions ) the chern - simons charge of the multisphaleron solutions is given by @xmath61 the chern - simons charge of the multisphalerons corresponds to their baryonic charge , @xmath62 , since the u(1 ) field does not contribute to their baryon number [ 5 ] .",
    "we here restrict the numerical calculations to the limit of vanishing mixing angle . in this limit the u(1 )",
    "field decouples and the function @xmath63 can consistently be set to zero .",
    "the case of non - vanishing mixing angle will be considered later [ 15 ] .",
    "subject to the boundary conditions ( 25 ) we then solve the equations numerically , using the dimensionless coordinate @xmath64 .",
    "we fix the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the higgs mass is varied .",
    "the numerical calculations are based on the newton - raphson method .",
    "the equations are discretized on a non - equidistant grid in @xmath67 and an equidistant grid in @xmath42 , where typical grids used have sizes @xmath68 and @xmath69 covering integration regions @xmath70 up to @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the numerical error for the functions is estimated to be on the order of @xmath73 .    to obtain the multisphaleron solutions we start with the @xmath2 sphaleron solution as initial guess and increase the value of @xmath1 slowly .",
    "this numerical procedure thus involves the construction of intermediate configurations , where @xmath1 takes on non - integer values . at each integer values of @xmath1",
    "a multisphaleron solution is reached .    in the following",
    "we exhibit the axially symmetric multisphaleron solutions .",
    "in particular we show as gauge invariant quantities , the energy density @xmath74 , defined by @xmath75 where @xmath30 is the energy in tev , and the magnitude of the higgs field @xmath76 in units of @xmath77 . in figs .",
    "1a and 1b we show the energy density @xmath74 of the multisphalerons with @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the higgs mass @xmath80 , and in figs .",
    "2a and 2b we show the corresponding magnitude of the higgs field @xmath76 .",
    "the energy density is strongly peaked along the @xmath81-axis , with the maximum shifting outward with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude of the higgs field , being zero at the origin , remains small along the @xmath81-axis for increasingly longer intervals with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this is also demonstrated in the following comparison of the sphaleron and all multisphalerons up to @xmath79 . in figs .",
    "3a and 3b we show the energy density along the @xmath81-axis and along the @xmath26-axis for the multisphalerons up to @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and in figs .",
    "4a and 4b we show the corresponding magnitude of the higgs field .",
    "the energy @xmath82 of the multisphalerons from @xmath78 to @xmath79 is shown in table 1 for the higgs masses @xmath83 , @xmath80 and @xmath84 and compared with the corresponding energy @xmath85 of the sphaleron , by considering the ratio @xmath86 . while for small higgs masses the energy of the multisphalerons is smaller than @xmath1 times the energy of the sphaleron , for large higgs masses the energy of the multisphalerons is larger than @xmath1 times the energy of the sphaleron .",
    "we have constructed multisphaleron solutions in the weak interactions for vanishing mixing angle .",
    "the extension to finite mixing angle is in progress [ 15 ] .    while the sphaleron is spherically symmetric for vanishing mixing angle , the multisphaleron solutions are only axially symmetric .",
    "they can be characterized by an integer @xmath1 , related to the winding of the fields in the azimuthal angle @xmath4 . with increasing @xmath1",
    "the energy density of the multisphalerons becomes increasingly deformed , the maximum occurring along the @xmath81-axis at increasing distance from the origin .",
    "the energy of the multisphalerons is on the order of @xmath1 times the sphaleron energy . for small higgs masses",
    "the energy of the multisphalerons is less than @xmath1 times the energy of the sphaleron , @xmath87 , while for large higgs masses the energy of the multisphalerons is greater than @xmath1 times the energy of the sphaleron , @xmath88 .    while the sphaleron has chern - simons charge @xmath89 , the multisphaleron solutions have chern - simons charge @xmath90 .",
    "we conjecture , that symmetric non - contractible loops can be constructed , leading from a vacuum with chern - simons charge @xmath91 to a topologically distinct vacuum with chern - simons charge @xmath92 , passing the multisphaleron solution with @xmath90 midway .    at finite temperature such paths involving multisphalerons",
    "should allow for thermal fermion number violating transitions , corresponding to tunnelling transitions via multiinstantons at zero temperature .",
    "since multiinstantons with winding number @xmath1 possess @xmath1 fermion zero modes , we expect to encounter @xmath1 fermion zero modes along vacuum to vacuum paths , passing the @xmath1-th multisphaleron .",
