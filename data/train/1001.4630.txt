    "with the @xmath2anda experiment at fair in darmstadt@xcite , a high resolution hadron spectroscopy will be performed .",
    "the charmonium states partly discovered with existing @xmath3 experiments will be measured with the @xmath2anda with much higher resolution , which could not be achieved by @xmath3 machines , but only via @xmath4 processes . the exotic hybrid and glueball states , predicted by lattice qcd , as well as @xmath5 collisions will be also investigated .",
    "the experimental setup of the @xmath2anda project needs to be able to reconstruct predicted states and their decay channels with high precision . both , charged and neutral decay products of resonances , have to be detected with very good spatial and energy resolutions . for this purpose , detailed simulations and a corresponding analysis of various physics channels",
    "are performed . in this paper , the decay of the the @xmath6 charmonium state via the following reaction",
    "is discussed : @xmath7 this is an example of a neutral decay , which can be studied with @xmath2anda .",
    "the @xmath2anda detection system will be the perfect instrument for this , since it is highly compact , versatile and has a 4@xmath8 coverage .",
    "the @xmath2anda detection system is presented in the left picture in fig .",
    "[ panda_detector ] .",
    "it depicts the micro vertex detector ( mvd ) , time projection chamber ( tpc ) and , alternatively , straw tube tracker ( stt ) , electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) , cherenkov detector ( dirc ) , muon detector ( muo ) , time - of - flight ( tof ) , drift chambers ( dc ) and the forward calorimeter ( fc ) .",
    "the emc detector , placed inside the target spectrometer ( ts ) , consists of the forward end - cap ( fwendcap ) , barrel ( barrel ) and the backward end - cap ( bwendcap ) and is shown in more detail on the right hand side in fig .",
    "[ panda_detector ] .",
    "this highly granulated calorimeter , built from @xmath916000 pwo crystals with the size of about 2x2x20  @xmath10 and 22  @xmath11 radiation length , was used to reconstruct the presented charmonium @xmath6 ( [ reaction ] ) from seven photons in the final state .",
    "reaction ( [ reaction ] ) has been simulated by using the ` evtgen`@xcite event generator which has been included inside the simulation and analysis framework of the @xmath2anda , called ` pandaroot`@xcite . `",
    "evtgen ` , adapted for @xmath2anda , was designed by babar@xcite and originally used for the simulation of the physics of the b meson decays .",
    "the ` rho ` package@xcite was applied to reconstruct invariant masses of final - state and intermediate particles of eq .",
    "( [ reaction ] ) .",
    "the simulation framework is based on the virtual monte carlo@xcite concept , which allows to perform simulations for different transport models without changing the user code or geometry description .",
    "the electronic response of the emc crystals was simulated together with an optimised cluster reconstruction analysis .",
    "the emc response has been compared and tuned to experimental data .",
    "the two - photon invariant mass spectrum , as presented in the top panels in fig .",
    "[ inv_masses ]",
    ". shows a clear signals from @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles on top of a continuous combinatorial background .",
    "the spectrum was fitted using a gaussian function representing signal together with the second order polynomial function , representing the background .",
    "a standard deviation , @xmath14 , of 6  mev and 15  mev was found for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "pions and etas were selected by applying a windows of 3@xmath14 around the two peaks as indicated by the arrows in both panels .",
    "the 3@xmath14 cuts have been applied to reduce the huge combinatorial background .",
    "the bottom - left panel in fig .",
    "[ inv_masses ] .",
    "depicts the invariant mass of the ( @xmath12@xmath12@xmath13 ) system for which all two - photon candidates were used to identify @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles .",
    "the bottom - right panel depicts the same analysis with the cuts applied to identify @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons .",
    "4.6 cm    6.4 cm    note that the peak to background ratio drastically improved by a factor 2500 , as expected .",
    "the combination of the reconstructed @xmath15 mass , together with the remaining photon , provides the identification of the @xmath6 particle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hcinv_masses ] .",
    "in this analysis , only cuts for @xmath12 and @xmath13 masses have been applied . the simulated spectrum representing the @xmath6 , yields to a peak - to - background of 30 , a mass resolution ( fwhm ) of 70  mev , and an efficiency of the @xmath6 reconstruction of about 30% .",
    "the distributions predicted by the two transport models , geant3 and geant4 , are comparable .",
    "a small shift of 25  mev can be observed , which can originate from small differences in the energy response between geant3 and geant4 .",
    "a further study is in progress .",
    "the analysis of the charmonium @xmath6 state via the neutral channel has been done for two different transport models within the ` pandaroot ` framework . a more extensive simulation for other channels , including charged particles ,",
    "will be studied in the near future .",
