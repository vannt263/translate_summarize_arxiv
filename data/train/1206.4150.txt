    "recently , the quantum integrable spin chains with higher rank symmetry algebras have attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "however , the most part of the methods developed so far enable one to deal only with @xmath9-symmetric models for which finite - dimensional as well as infinite - dimensional representations in the quantum space have been analyzed thoroughly .",
    "the fundamental equations which underlie integrability are the universal yang - baxter @xmath10-relation and its particular cases : the @xmath11-relation with the general @xmath0-operator acting in two quantum spaces and the @xmath11-relation with @xmath0-matrix acting in two finite - dimensional auxiliary spaces ( e.g. , in spaces of the defining representations of @xmath9 ) .",
    "the last case of the @xmath11-relation is also obtained by means of the evaluation homomorphism of the @xmath12-type yangian : @xmath13 . for @xmath9-symmetric models",
    "the general @xmath0-operator acting in two infinite - dimensional quantum spaces is known and it serves as a local building block in the construction of the baxter @xmath14-operators @xcite .",
    "much less is known about integrable quantum lattice models and spin chains with @xmath15 symmetry ( see , however , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "substantially , it is related to the fact that one of the basic algebraic object  the yangian @xmath16 @xcite which can be defined by the @xmath11-relation with @xmath15-type @xmath0-matrix acting in two finite - dimensional auxiliary spaces ( the spaces of @xmath17 defining representations ) does not possess the evaluation homomorphism @xmath18 .",
    "one can think that in this case the yangian @xmath16 could be substituted by a more sophisticated olshanskii twisted yangian or by the standard reflection equation algebra for which the evaluation homomorphism exists ( see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "however these type of algebras are used only for the formulation of integrable open spin chain models with nontrivial boundary conditions .    in this paper",
    "our aim is to adapt some methods developed for @xmath9-symmetric spin chains to spin chains with @xmath19 symmetry which is interpreted as the conformal symmetry in @xmath20 .",
    "here we make the first step in this direction .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .    in section 2",
    "we recall basic facts about conformal algebra @xmath21 and its representations  @xcite .",
    "we construct representation of the conformal algebra @xmath19 in the space of tensor fields by the method of induced representations .",
    "this material is more or less standard  @xcite .",
    "our approach is slightly different and appropriate for our own purposes and we include it for the completeness .",
    "there is also alternative approach ",
    "the so called embedding formalism @xcite .",
    "in section 3 we collect some basic facts about @xmath22-operators .",
    "the @xmath22-operator for @xmath9-symmetric quantum spin chain can be constructed from the yangian @xmath23 by means of the evaluation homomorphism @xmath13 and is expressed as a polarized casimir operator for @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a parameter , @xmath27 are generators of @xmath24 and in the first space ( auxiliary space ) of the tensor product the fundamental ( defining ) representation @xmath28 is taken and in the second space ( quantum space ) one can choose an arbitrary representation @xmath29 .",
    "such @xmath22-operators were considered in @xcite .",
    "if we fix @xmath29 as a differential ( induced ) representation  @xcite , then the @xmath22-operator exhibits a remarkable factorization property  @xcite and respects @xmath11-relation with yang s @xmath0-matrix .",
    "henceforth , we define the _ @xmath22-operator _ as an operator @xmath22 acting in the tensor product of some finite - dimensional auxiliary space and arbitrary quantum space ( generically infinite - dimensional ) and furthermore @xmath22 respects @xmath11-relation with a certain numerical @xmath0-matrix acting in the auxiliary spaces . for the conformal algebra @xmath19 of the pseudo - euclidean space @xmath30",
    ", we consider the operator @xmath22 which is constructed from the @xmath19 polarized casimir operator acting in the tensor product of two spaces : the first one ( the auxiliary space ) is the space of a spinor representation ( instead of fundamental one ) and the second quantum space is the space of the differential representation of the conformal algebra @xmath19 .",
    "it happens that in general this operator respects @xmath11-relation only if we choose special ( scalar ) differential representation of the conformal algebra in the quantum space when spin part @xmath31 of the lorentz generators is equal to zero . corresponding numerical @xmath0-matrix ( acting in the spaces of spinor representation ) is rather nontrivial .",
    "for the first time it appeared in  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where the @xmath11-relation for the @xmath15-invariant @xmath22-operator with fundamental ( defining ) representation in the quantum space was established .",
    "thus , we generalize this result .",
    "namely we prove that in the @xmath22-operator one can replace ( in the quantum space ) the defining representation to the infinite - dimensional scalar representation parameterized by the conformal dimension @xmath32 .",
    "this new conformal @xmath22-operator can be factorized as well ( similar to the @xmath9 case ) and as we will see it corresponds to a certain integrable systems  @xcite .    in section 4",
    "we specify formulae of the previous section to the case of the conformal algebra @xmath33 in 4-dimensional minkowski space @xmath34 ( actually these formulas can be easily generalized to the case of any conformal algebra @xmath35 in 4-dimensional space @xmath36 , where @xmath37 ) .",
    "this case is a special one since @xmath33 is isomorphic to @xmath38 ( for complexifications we have @xmath39 ) and consequently we can establish connection with the known construction @xcite developed for @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , as we show the @xmath22-operators for these two algebras are related by an appropriate change of variables .",
    "the numerical @xmath0-matrix for both @xmath22-operators is the yang s one ( for the @xmath33 case it is shown in subsection 3.2 ) and in the quantum space , for the conformal @xmath22-operator , we obtain the general differential representation of the conformal algebra with nontrivial spin part @xmath31 , i.e. we deal with representation @xmath41 of @xmath33 parameterized by conformal dimension @xmath32 and two spin variables @xmath42 .    in subsection 4.2 ,",
    "following the approach @xcite which was developed for the @xmath40 case , we reproduce intertwining operators for the product of two @xmath43-type @xmath22-operators .",
    "these operators are building blocks in construction of @xmath0-operator which acts in the tensor product of two infinite - dimensional representations .",
    "as we indicate at the end of subsection 4.2 the form of these intertwining operators is not manifestly lorentz covariant .",
    "moreover these operators are not properly defined can be treated only formally .",
    "that is why , in the next section 5 , the same intertwining operators and @xmath0 operator are constructed directly without using the isomorphism @xmath39 .    the main purpose of section 5 is the construction of the general @xmath0-operator which acts in the tensor product @xmath44 of two infinite - dimensional representations of the conformal algebra @xmath45 and solves @xmath11-relation with conformal @xmath22-operators . for the simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of euclidean space @xmath46 because in this situation all integral operators are well defined in generic situation . in the case of the conformal algebra @xmath45 we construct @xmath0-operator for the scalar ( @xmath47 ) representations @xmath48 and in the special case of @xmath49 , i.e. the conformal algebra of the @xmath5-dimensional euclidean space , the @xmath0-operator is constructed for a rather general class of representations @xmath50 with nontrivial spin parts .",
    "we build the general @xmath0-operator as a product of simpler operators @xmath51 which respect relations of @xmath11-type : @xmath52 .",
    "each @xmath22-operator depends on the set of four parameters @xmath53 and the @xmath11-relation implies that the @xmath0-operator , intertwining the product @xmath54 of two @xmath22-operators , interchanges the sets of their parameters : @xmath55 .",
    "consequently it is reasonable to implement this transposition in several steps and to consider operators @xmath56 which intertwine two l - operators and transpose ( or change ) only a part of their parameters .",
    "the operators @xmath3 and @xmath2 separately change the parameters in the first and second factor of the product @xmath57 . actually the operators @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be identified with the intertwining operators of two irreducible representations of the conformal algebra  @xcite so that our construction has a transparent representation theory meaning . the operator @xmath4 interchanges parameters between the factors @xmath58 and @xmath59 and the form of @xmath4 is obtained from the intertwining operators @xmath3 and @xmath2 by some kind of the duality transformation .",
    "this duality transformation is very similar to the one obtained in the spin chain model  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it also resembles the dual conformal transformation for the feynman diagrams  @xcite and for the scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric @xmath60 super yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "+ finally , the general @xmath0-operator that implements a special transposition in the set of parameters can be factorized in a product of operators @xmath56 which represent basic elementary transpositions .",
    "there are certain relations for the basic building blocks which produce all other relations for @xmath0-operators .",
    "indeed , the coxeter ( braid ) three - term relations in the symmetric group are represented as follows @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these coxeter three - term relations can be interpreted as star - triangle relations and play the important role in the construction of the general @xmath0-operator . in the n - dimensional scalar case",
    "these relations are well known star - triangle relations @xcite , @xcite for propagators of scalar fields . in the case of the conformal algebra @xmath49 of @xmath5-dimensional euclidean space",
    "we prove a new star - triangle relation for generic representations of the type @xmath41 included spin degrees of freedom , i.e. we generalize the scalar star - triangle relation to the star - triangle relation for the propagators of the spin particles .",
    "recall that the star - triangle relations happen to be a corner stone in the integrability of many lattice models of statistical mechanics @xcite ( see also papers @xcite and references therein ) . at the end of subsection 5.1 we show that the scalar star - triangle relations can be used for the formulation of the n - dimensional variant of the integrable lattice model proposed by lipatov @xcite ( see also @xcite where another integrable lattice models were constructed and investigated by means of the scalar star - triangle relations ) . to our knowledge integrable models related to the new spinorial star - triangle relation of @xmath49 type",
    "are still unknown .    in appendix",

    "<S> we build the @xmath0-operator as a product of more elementary operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> operators @xmath3 and @xmath2 are identified with intertwining operators of two irreducible representations of the conformal algebra and the operator @xmath4 is obtained from the intertwining operators @xmath3 and @xmath2 by a certain duality transformation . </S>",
    "<S> there are star - triangle relations for the basic building blocks @xmath1 and @xmath2 which produce all other relations for the general @xmath0-operators . in the case of the conformal algebra of n - dimensional euclidean space </S>",
    "<S> we construct the @xmath0-operator for the scalar ( spin part is equal to zero ) representations and prove that the star - triangle relation is a well known star - triangle relation for propagators of scalar fields . in the special case of the conformal algebra of the @xmath5-dimensional euclidean space , the @xmath0-operator is obtained for more general class of infinite - dimensional ( differential ) representations with nontrivial spin parts . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> for the case of the @xmath5-dimensional euclidean space , we generalize the scalar star - triangle relation to the most general star - triangle relation for the propagators of particles with arbitrary spins .    * conformal algebra : r - matrix and star - triangle relation *    d. chicherin@xmath6 , s. derkachov@xmath7 and a.p . </S>",
