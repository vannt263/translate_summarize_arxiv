    "the ubiquity of energetic molecular outflows and atomic jets from young stellar objects ( ysos ) ranging from deeply embedded infrared sources to classical t tauri stars suggests that they are an inescapable by - product of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "winds from yso disks play an important role in shedding angular momentum carried by inflowing material , thereby permitting further accretion in order for the central objects to attain stellar dimensions @xcite .",
    "these winds may also have strong effects on the dynamical evolution of the parent cloud by providing a source of turbulent energy @xcite , and may help to determine the final masses of stars by reversing the infall of surrounding gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding the physics of protostellar winds is of essential importance to the theory of star formation .    among the various scenarios regarding the origin and nature of the protostellar winds ,",
    "the most promising is magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models in which winds are driven by the interaction of the centrifugal force with open magnetic fields threading rapidly rotating disks .",
    "these magnetocentrifugally driven wind models can account for observed high mass and momentum losses @xcite and the kinematic and structural characteristics of bipolar molecular outflows in general @xcite , as well as in specific cases ( e.g. , hh111 , cf .",
    "it is , however , still controversial whether the wind originates only from a small magnetosphere - disk interaction region near the central star @xcite , or whether it emanates from an extended region of the disk ( following the seminal model of blandford & payne 1982 ; see , e.g. , k@xmath4nigl & pudritz 2000 ) .",
    "although the role of magnetic fields in driving protostellar winds is by now well established ( at least theoretically ) , their complementary role in governing the stability properties of winds is less well explored .",
    "in addition , azimuthal and vertical shear within winds may also affect their stability properties .",
    "questions of wind stability are potentially important for both large scale and small - scale phenomena .",
    "these include understanding the role of magnetic fields and velocity shear in ( a ) helping winds to propagate over enormous distances ( up to a factor @xmath5 in dynamic range ) through the ism in parsec - scale giant hh flows @xcite ; ( b ) creating bright hh `` knots '' spaced throughout optical jets @xcite ; ( c ) governing the angular extent of the emergent wind and establishing the momentum distribution for driving molecular outflows ; and ( d ) converting large - scale ordered flow energy to jet heating through small - scale instabilities .",
    "in addition , it is important to study the dynamical properties of large classes of theoretical wind solutions to test whether they are stable equilibria which can represent real astronomical systems , or whether they are unstable equilibria which should rarely be observed in nature because they evolve rapidly into other configurations .    previous studies of time - dependent behavior in steadily - input mhd winds have focussed primarily on the kelvin - helmholtz instabilities driven by the interaction of the wind surface layer with the ambient medium ( see , e.g. , the studies of * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "generally , heavy jets containing strong toroidal fields are relatively resistant to these instabilities .",
    "in addition to `` driven '' instabilities resulting from boundary conditions , winds may also be subject to `` free '' instabilities in their interiors . whether a given wind solution is internally unstable must depend on the velocity shear , magnetic geometry , and internal stratification .",
    "one route to studying internal wind instabilities is via time - dependent numerical simulations of winds .",
    "although such studies have yielded intriguing results on the development of episodic knots in mhd winds , the computational demands in carrying out simulations precludes extensive exploration of parameter space , large spatial dynamic range , or very long - term integration .",
    "in addition , some of the time - dependent internal features found in simulations may be introduced by particular choices of inflow boundary conditions that are inconsistent with a steady - state flow , rather than occurring as a result of intrinsic instability of the wind .",
    "due to the importance of gaseous accretion disks in a wide variety of astrophysical systems , major attention has focussed on disk dynamics , and , in particular , the role of instability - driven turbulence in angular momentum transport .",
    "saturated magnetorotational instabilities ( hereafter mris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) represent perhaps the most important local dynamical process affecting disk evolution .",
    "magnetized disk winds share many generic properties with disks , so it is interesting to investigate the potential importance of mris in winds .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the internal stability of rotating , magnetized protostellar winds to ( primarily ) local shear and buoyancy modes .",
    "we also extend previous studies of local mris in accretion disks .",
    "the fundamental difference between `` wind '' and `` disk '' systems in our idealized models is in the absence or presence of gravity as a confining force .",
    "these systems may also be distinguished by the geometry of the magnetic field , with toroidally - dominant fields expected in the wind case , but either poloidal or toroidal fields possible for the disk case . our most general analysis and results apply to cold flows , but we also perform separate calculations ( see  7 ) including thermal effects which specialize to local analysis of mris .",
    "whether a wind originates from a narrow boundary layer or an extended radial region , the radial expansion of the flow will lead to shear in the azimuthal velocity field of the asymptotic state .",
    "the total specific angular momentum of the flow , @xmath6 , is conserved along streamlines ( where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the poloidal , toroidal components of the magnetic field and the flow velocity ) . if the alfv@xmath11n  mach number @xmath12 , the kinetic part dominates the specific angular momentum and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the angular velocity @xmath14 in the asymptotic wind will have a gradient @xmath15 .",
    "if the wind comes from a boundary layer , then @xmath16 may be small ; if the wind originates from a large region with self - similar scalings , then @xmath17 . in either case",
    ", @xmath18 is expected to be a negative , order - unity quantity for wind systems . for thin disk systems ( i.e. , negligible pressure support )",
    ", a keplerian radial profile @xmath19 is expected if the central mass is dominant . for the analysis of this paper ( except where noted otherwise ) , we adopt @xmath20 for both `` wind '' and `` disk '' systems , but our qualitative results are insensitive to this assumption . as discussed below , order - unity radial logarithmic gradients may also be expected in the magnetic field strengths ; we allow for a range of magnetic gradients .",
    "significant shear may also exist in the poloidal velocities of jets if they originate from an extended radial region .",
    "the asymptotic outflow speed @xmath21 generally scales linearly with the rotational speed at the footpoint @xmath22 of the streamline , so that @xmath23 if the range of footpoint radii is small compared to the range of asymptotic radii ( as for a wind from a boundary layer ) , then @xmath24 ; if the radial ranges are comparable , then @xmath25 is negative and order unity . for disks ,",
    "the vertical velocity shear is negligible .",
    "we allow for a range of vertical shear rates in the present analysis .",
    "our analysis consists of developing and solving sets of linearized mhd equations for several general classes of background flows .",
    "both axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric disturbances are explored . even in linearized form ,",
    "mhd problems present considerable technical challenges .",
    "thus , instead of attacking sophisticated sets of steady - state wind solutions , for many specific examples we will take as an unperturbed configuration one of the power - law cylindrical equilibrium solutions recently identified by @xcite as asymptotic states of self - similar disk winds .",
    "these have density @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and sound speed @xmath29 . although these adopted initial configurations are relatively simple , they retain general asymptotic characteristics of mhd disk winds in the sense that they have both azimuthal and vertical magnetic field and velocity components with arbitrary ratios , and all the physical variables have radial gradients .",
    "these gradients may also be thought of as representing local scalings within a more complex overall stratification .",
    "we also include models without vertical motion but with significant equilibrium gravity to study stability in magnetized astrophysical disks . in our analysis of mris",
    ", we use equilibria with uniform @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , and take @xmath32 with arbitrary @xmath33 .",
    "because the systems we are studying contain significant azimuthal shear , an arbitrary initial spatial planform is not maintained indefinitely .",
    "when @xmath34 and the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath35 ( and/or when @xmath36 and the vertical wavenumber @xmath37 ; the prime represents a differentiation with respect to @xmath38 ) , spatial wavefunctions may become increasingly radially corrugated in time due to the kinematic shearing of the wavefronts imposed in the initial conditions .",
    "if we describe the radial spatial wavefunction in terms of the amplitudes of fourier coefficients with radial wavenumbers @xmath39 , this corresponds at late times to a secular increase in the amplitudes of large-@xmath39 terms and decrease in the amplitudes of small-@xmath39 terms .",
    "as we shall show , all the disturbances we identify are stabilized at sufficiently large @xmath39 .",
    "thus , if @xmath40 and/or @xmath41 , the net amplification factor for any arbitrary initial disturbance is limited by the rate of kinematic growth of radial corrugation compared to the growth rate of any dynamically - driven instabilities .    in previous work , two complementary analytical methods have been used to study small - amplitude disturbances in shearing astrophysical systems .",
    "one approach adopts the `` shearing - sheet '' formalism , and integrates the local , time - dependent , linearized wave equations directly to obtain the evolutionary behavior of shearing wavelets treated as an initial - value problem @xcite .",
    "an alternative analytical approach uses wkb techniques to derive dispersion relations for spatial fourier modes , superpositions of which represent local wavefunctions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper includes analyses using both approaches , and also introduces a hybrid technique which we term a `` coherent wavelet '' analysis .",
    "we adopt the `` modal '' strategy in order to identify characteristic instantaneous growth rates and physical mechanisms for a wide variety of spatial disturbances . by considering the time over which a spatial pattern is altered by shear",
    ", we can estimate the net amplification factor of a given initial modal disturbance .",
    "we use the shearing - sheet formalism for studying magnetorotational instabilities , which are cut off at relatively small values of @xmath42 ( whereas the modal analysis applies to large @xmath42 ) , and also for studying buoyancy instabilities in the high-@xmath2 regime where modes are short - lived .",
    "we show that the results obtained from the shearing - sheet integrations in both cases are in excellent agreement with the predictions of a coherent wavelet analysis , in which time - dependent growth rates @xmath43 are computed by time - localizing the shearing - sheet equations and solving an analytic dispersion relation .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : we begin by studying instabilities in cold , magnetized winds . in  2 ,",
    "the basic mhd equations and the specific adopted wind equilibria are described . in  3 , we analyze the stability of winds to the simplest perturbation with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath2 are respectively the vertical and azimuthal wavenumbers of the perturbation .",
    "we term these the `` fundamental modes '' ; we present solutions for stable and unstable global modes under the assumption of free lagrangian boundary conditions . the modal analysis and general local dispersion relation for cold flows with arbitrary @xmath45 and @xmath2",
    "are presented in  4 .",
    "we present numerical solutions of the dispersion relation for both axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric perturbations in  5 . in  6 , we classify the unstable or overstable modes and provide the physical interpretation for each mode .",
    "next , we include ( variable ) thermal pressure terms to compare the susceptibility of cold winds vs. warm disks to shear instabilities . in  7 we analyze the axisymmetric balbus - hawley instability of poloidal fields and the non - axisymmetric mri of toroidal fields , discuss the respective instability mechanisms , and provide the corresponding instability criteria . here",
    ", we use the coherent wavelet technique to compute growth rates , and compare with direct shearing - sheet integrations .",
    "the generalized instability criteria and net amplification factors for the magnetorotational disturbances with both toroidal and poloidal background fields are also derived .",
    "finally in  8 , we summarize and discuss conclusions of the present work .",
    "we begin with the ideal mhd equations @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the density , @xmath51 is the fluid velocity , @xmath52 is the magnetic field , @xmath53 is the thermal pressure , and @xmath54 is the gravitational force due to a central object . we ignore self - gravity in the flow .",
    "we now consider cold , magnetized cylindrical flows . since the flow velocity in disk winds is always supersonic except in the vicinity of the disk where the material is lifted by the thermal pressure @xcite , the thermal pressure term in eq .",
    "( 2 ) can generally be neglected compared to magnetic stress . except for investigations of generalized mris (  7 )",
    ", we shall drop the thermal pressure term .",
    "we adopt standard cylindrical coordinates @xmath55 .    by assuming that @xmath56 and all variables are independent of @xmath57",
    ", we have a general equilibrium condition from eq .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath58 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath38 . at a large distance from the origin , the gravitational force due to the central source",
    "can also be ignored on the grounds that magnetic and centrifugal forces far exceed it . in this case , the magnetic hoop stress acting inward is the only force that balances the outward centrifugal force and outward magnetic pressure gradient force ( under the assumption that the magnetic field strength decreases outward ) .    as an initial equilibrium configuration of the wind , for specific cases",
    "we will adopt the asymptotic solutions for cylindrically symmetric axial flows presented by @xcite .",
    "all variables have power - law dependences on @xmath38 : @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "we define the local pitch angle @xmath61 of the magnetic fields as @xmath62 . neglecting @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , radial momentum balance requires @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the local alfv@xmath11n speed defined by @xmath66    it is obvious from eq .",
    "( 6 ) that there would be no such power - law solutions if @xmath67 .",
    "this is because when @xmath67 , the magnetic field has so steep a gradient that the corresponding pressure force always exceeds the tension .",
    "therefore , to ensure force balance and cylindrical collimation in winds with power - law profiles , the magnetic field strength must decline with @xmath38 more slowly than @xmath68 .",
    "we can define an angular velocity @xmath69 as that of a rotating frame in which the flow of winds is parallel to the local field line .",
    "@xmath70 is the rotation rate of the magnetic field lines thought of as rigid wires .",
    "in such a frame , the family of solutions can be completely described in terms of scaled values of the specific angular momentum @xmath71 , the bernoulli constant @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the condition for a super - alfv@xmath11nic outflow velocity requires @xmath75 . generally speaking ,",
    "the pitch angle @xmath61 does not depend on @xmath73 , although one can parameterize @xmath61 in terms of @xmath73 , @xmath72 , and @xmath71 .",
    "however , for flows originating from a kepler - rotating disk , angular momentum and energy conservation requirements limit the range of @xmath61 available to an equilibrium ( asymptotic ) magnetic field configuration . utilizing eqs .",
    "( 15 ) to ( 23 ) of @xcite one can show that the maximum , over all permitted values of @xmath72 and @xmath71 , pitch angle @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 which is attained when @xmath78 and @xmath79 . if @xmath80 , the streamline never reaches the alfv@xmath11n radius .",
    "we first consider the response of the equilibrium state when small , axisymmetric perturbations with an infinite wavelength along a vertical direction are imposed .",
    "we term the waves with @xmath81 and @xmath82 the `` fundamental modes '' analogous to eigenfunctions of oscillations without any node .",
    "let the subscripts 0 and 1 denote the equilibrium and perturbed states , respectively .",

    "growth rates of unstable fm are comparable to inner - wind alfv@xmath11n  frequencies .",
    "long wavelength modes with large amplitudes at large radii are all stable , for power - law wind profiles . the tr mode ( see  6.1.4 ) is an overstability , with growth suppressed when @xmath39 increases through shear of the vertical velocity , simply becoming oscillatory mhd waves .",
    "the axisymmetric toroidal buoyancy mode ( atb ;  6.1.2 ) is activated initially by the buoyancy force and subsequently by bending poloidal magnetic fields . in geometrical form",

    "the non - axisymmetric toroidal buoyancy mode ( ntb ; see  6.2.1 ) is much like the parker instability , but with the centrifugal force replacing the role of external gravity .",

    "thus instead of an exponential growth , at later time of evolution we have the power - law growth due to the kinematic shear .",
    "this behavior is distinct from the mri modes , which are strictly stable for large enough @xmath39 .",
    "however , the continued local growth of buoyancy perturbations is offset by the role of kinematic shear in mixing phases of disturbances .",

    "although there may be a significant growth of the ntb modes on large scales , their dynamical effect on small scales is limited by the phase mixing due to shear .    in the presence of vertical shear",
    ", the evolution of atb modes is also affected by the kinematic growth of @xmath39 although they are axisymmetric modes .",
    "the net amplification of the atb modes follows a power - law growth as that of the ntb mods does .",

( 86 ) with @xmath284 replaced by @xmath663 gives the temporal behavior of the net amplification for the atb modes .      in order for a disk wind to overcome the gravitational barrier due to a central object and to be centrifugally launched from the surface of a keplerian disk",
    ", the poloidal components of field lines should thread the disk at an angle of 30@xmath288 or more from the axis @xcite . once material starts to flow outward along such field lines , it is accelerated primarily in the radial direction by the centrifugal force or by the pressure gradient in the toroidal field . beyond the alfv@xmath11n  surface where the local , poloidal component of the flow velocity is equal to that of the alfv@xmath11nwave velocity , the magnetic field is not strong enough to play a role of  a rigid wire \" , and the inertia of gas becomes important , winding up the field lines to be progressively more toroidal . in this process , the azimuthal flow velocity decreases below the corotation value . with the increase in the azimuthal component of the magnetic field",
    ", the associated hoop stress provides the collimation of the outflow and causes the streamlines to bend upward .",
    "the radial flow velocity of the outflow is still positive , although it decreases gradually , eventually becoming zero at the cylindrical asymptotic limit .",
    "the power - law solutions ( with @xmath56 ) we adopted for many specific cases represent the asymptotic limit of each streamline .",
    "@xcite presented self - similar steady solutions for disk winds with cylindrical asymptotics and gave the asymptotic fluid and alfv@xmath11nspeeds and the location of the asymptotic streamlines , characterized by @xmath73 together with @xmath664 or @xmath665 , where @xmath666 , and @xmath667 denote the radii of the footpoint , the alfv@xmath11n  surface , and the asymptote of each given streamline , respectively .",
    "typical numerical values for those solutions are @xmath668 , @xmath669 , and @xmath670 for @xmath147 , and @xmath671 and @xmath672 for @xmath673 , where @xmath674 is the keplerian rotation rate at the streamline footpoint .    using these values",
    "we can estimate the growth times of the global fundamental mode and the fastest growing ( with @xmath39 near 0 ) toroidal buoyancy modes .",
    "the foregoing analysis suggests that these disturbances will play the most significant dynamical role , given the ineffectiveness of mris in cold , @xmath8-dominated flows .",
    "we define the time to grow by @xmath675 orders of magnitude as @xmath676 . for fm ,",
    "@xmath677 , so from fig .  2 and eq .",
    "( 25 ) we have for @xmath673 @xmath678 for atb and ntb , from eqs .",
    "( 45 ) and ( 52 ) , we have for @xmath563 and @xmath147 @xmath679 @xmath680 respectively . here",
    ", @xmath681 is the mass of the central star and @xmath682 is the angular speed of a disk at the footpoint @xmath683 of the innermost streamline of winds .",
    "the fact that the growth of the fm by a factor @xmath684 occurs within @xmath685 times the rotation period of the disk at the inner radius , far shorter than the lifetime of winds ( @xmath686 yrs ) , suggests that the fm mode is dynamically important in the evolution of the disk winds .",
    "when @xmath73 is small , the radial turbulent mixing of the wind , caused by both axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric toroidal buoyancy modes over a relatively short time , is likely to cascade down into arbitrarily smaller scales to dissipate when the microscopic processes such as magnetic reconnection are included .",
    "the released energy in the dissipation processes may heat up the flow , potentially making a significant contribution to the heating of protostellar winds and jets . because the growth rates of buoyancy modes are proportional to the equilibrium magnetic forces ( cf .",
    "[ 45 ] and [ 52 ] ) , winds that have approached a force - free magnetic configuration will not be subject to the atb and ntb instabilities .",
    "the global fundamental mode affects only the inner region of the disk winds ( e.g. , the central tenth for the model shown in fig .",
    "the logarithmic density gradient @xmath687 changes relative to the equilibrium value by @xmath688 .",
    "3 shows that as a consequence of the fundamental mode , the very central region becomes more steeply stratified , a surrounding concentric region less steeply stratified , and the balance ( most of the wind ) remains nearly unchanged .",
    "thus , the fm tends to enhance jetlike structure in the central parts of winds .",
    "in addition , because of their tendency to compress interior gas via the fm mechanism , disk winds may help to collimate any interior flows into narrow , fast jets , even when the disk winds themselves have relatively slow motion ( cf .",
    "what do the present results imply about the likely radial extent of protostellar winds ?",
    "first , we note that observed optical jets are unlikely to be isolated structures , because if so they would be significantly overpressured relative to the ambient medium : since magnetocentrifugal jet models typically predict internal alfv@xmath11n  speeds comparable to their flow speeds in the range @xmath689",
    "km s@xmath690 , they have strong internal magnetic pressure @xmath691 ergs @xmath692 , which is about 6 orders of magnitude greater than the gas pressure of ambient medium , @xmath693 ergs @xmath692 . here as reference values we adopted @xmath694 @xmath692 , @xmath695 @xmath692 , @xmath696 km s@xmath690 , and @xmath697 km s@xmath690 with @xmath698 being the mass of a hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "thus the pressure imbalance at the outer boundary of the jet would cause either the wind as a whole or only its surface layer to expand until a new balance is attained . based on the results of this paper ,",
    "if the magnetic field at the base of the wind is stratified less steeply than @xmath68 , then perturbations of the outer parts of the wind are stable . as a consequence ,",
    "only the surface layers of such winds would expand in order to achieve a pressure - balanced condition with the ambient medium .",
    "if , on the other hand , the wind s magnetic field is stratified more steeply than @xmath68 at its base , no equilibrium is even possible ; the wind would expand as a whole to fill the entire @xmath699 steradians , with the inner parts having higher density observable as a narrow optical jet ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations presently underway @xcite support previous work indicating that protostellar winds with a wide - angle component are better able to produce observed molecular outflow structures than purely jetlike winds ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but further studies are required to determine just how distributed in angle the wind momentum should be - i.e. , to discriminate between `` fully - expanded '' and `` surface - expanded '' models .",
    "recent observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showing a correlation in molecular outflow kinematics with age - with extremely high velocity , highly - collimated flows seen only in the youngest sources - may indicate an underlying temporal evolution from more - collimated to more - expanded protostellar winds .",
