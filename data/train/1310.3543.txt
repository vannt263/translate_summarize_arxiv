    "cosmic ray nuclei and nucleons scattering on top atmosphere makes ( by pions , kaons and late muons ) a final persistent neutrino raining called atmospheric neutrinos ruled at high gevs - tevs energies by muon flavor .",
    "the parent charged cosmic rays are widely smeared by solar , galactic magnetic fields . in the same way their secondaries , the atmospheric neutrinos ,",
    "are commonly spread homogeneously in the sky .",
    "therefore diffused atmospheric neutrinos can not offer any astronomy yet , as it has been shown by four hundred thousands neutrinos in icecube . as observed and expected atmospheric neutrinos up to tevs energies exhibit a muon flavor dominance , that suddenly ( and somehow surprisingly ) it is overthrown by recent @xmath1 highest @xcite energy icecube events .",
    "indeed the @xmath1 icecube events show a ruling cascade showering nature ( @xmath0 events ) and a rare muon ( @xmath6 events ) track signature .",
    "therefore the new break is not just in the spectra hardening but mainly it is in the sudden and remarkable @xmath2 @xmath22,@xmath3 @xmath23 flavor `` _ sorpasso _ '' or `` surpassing over '' @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "let us remind that atmospheric neutrino are born mostly after nucleon scattering by pion _ and _ muon decays .",
    "these two way for a neutrino production ( around gevs energy ) makes both lepton flavors , mostly muons ( twice muon over electron ones ) . along the vertical axis , at a few ten of gev energy , there is also a narrow windows for muon neutrino oscillations and its average peculiar anisotropy that makes them halves the primary ones .",
    "as soon as the muon energy increases their relativistic decay in flight ( whose time life - distance corresponds to @xmath24 km ) may overcome at few gev the @xmath25 km atmosphere height of vertical terrestrial atmosphere , where shower develops .",
    "the average muon mixing suppression is leading to up - going events rate half of the primary muon @xmath9 ones while the @xmath2 @xmath22 component rate decrease above gevs because muons has not time to decay in flight , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig6 ] while pion and kaon may still do it .",
    "the marginal vertical @xmath9 suppression at gevs energies is due to flavor mixing along the earth that deplete muon neutrino converting them into nearly unobservable @xmath3 ( hardly observable because of the large mass @xmath26 mass threshold ) .",
    "the same @xmath9 oscillation into @xmath3 become severe at @xmath27 gev at vertical axis , because of a last complete oscillation ; at higher energy @xmath9 @xmath10 have no time of flight to mix within earth size ; therefore @xmath9 @xmath10 keep their original flavor above hundreds gev becoming soon twice the electron flavor and even more at higher energy because of suppression of muon decay .     for all photons , cosmic rays and neutrinos in the universe sky , in log - log scale as a function of the energy .",
    "the the atmospheric neutrino oscillation flux in the vertical axis suffer a shrinkage oscillation due to the log scale , for tau neutrino appearance ; we overlap the icecube observed average atmospheric @xmath9 @xmath10 neutrino flux , shown better in next figures . ]    ) made by @xmath28 than by @xmath29 decay in flight ]    ) tracks over cascade events ( due to both flavor ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) ) derived from icecube data for low and highest energy events , for the most realistic fitting model considered in the text ]    it should remind that at gevs energies the @xmath30 pairs are widely deflected by geomagnetic fields ; therefore there is also a local zenith and azimuth anisotropy somehow related to the historical geomagnetic ( b.rossi ) cut - off in cosmic rays .",
    "moreover the atmosphere width depend on the zenith angle geometry as well as on the muon - pion - kaon decay distances : therefore at tevs energies the zenith anisotropy is remarkable .",
    "we shall concentrate to the average flux value .",
    "moreover at hundreds gev muon neutrinos can not oscillate much into tau states because of longer and longer oscillation distances ( respect to earth size ) . therefore muon signals above tens gev dominates again over electron ones while electron neutrino suffer as mentioned of the difficulty of energetic relativistic muons to decay .",
    "the pions and kaons have a lifetime two order of magnitude shorter than muons and the kaon mass makes the difference ; therefore at two order of energy higher , at tevs , also @xmath9 begin to suffer of a pion - kaon survival by a linear ( with energy ) suppression , and both @xmath9 , @xmath2 flavor follow a harder spectra than parental cosmic rays with an experimental exponential index @xmath31 as one would suggest , but at different ratio among the two flavors with an enhanced for @xmath9 over @xmath2 by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino process based on cosmic rays has been understood and tested from gevs up to few tens tev energy also by recent icecube results , see fig.[fig4 ] . however , as we shall suggest , there is a possible overestimation of atmospheric neutrino flux at these highest energies .",
    "the general average behavior of the muon ( added to its anti - muon ) @xmath9 energy flux @xmath32 between gev up to pev in average , ignoring here the muon - tau flavor detailed oscillations @xcite , may be approximated as follow to trace icecube data :    @xmath33^{-1 } + \\phi_{0_{\\nu_{\\mu}}}\\ ] ] @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    these functions keep care of the observed atmospheric @xmath9 , @xmath10 behavior in gev- pev range , trying to fit the 28 events hardening at hundreds tev and the needed cut off of events at pev ( because of the absence of additional events with higher energy in pev region events and in particular of @xmath38 , the enhanced glashow resonance at @xmath39 ) .    as mentioned @xmath2 flux as being secondary of muons becomes suppressed at higher energy ( gevs - tevs ) , i.e. the initial flavor ratio @xmath40 for atmospheric terrestrial neutrinos becomes larger leading to a factor @xmath41 at tev energies as shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "this occurs because we begin from a flavor @xmath2 @xmath9 @xmath3 equal @xmath42 and we end ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) at tevs to a flavor ratio @xmath2 @xmath9 @xmath3 equal @xmath43 ( we neglect here the rare @xmath3 appearance by mixing at those energies ) . therefore muon atmospheric neutrinos are ruling over electron ( cascade showers ) at high ( tevs ) energies . at higher energies , where the 28 events occur , ( hundred tev ) , pion and kaon decays ( as well as muon late decay ) are all too boosted and long life to take place ; they mostly interact with nucleons leading to an additional suppression in the spectra for both muons and electron @xmath2,@xmath22,@xmath9,@xmath10 ; at horizons their signal is crossing longest distances and they may survive enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude respect vertical events . at highest ( hundred tev or few pev ) energies the rare very unstable charmed mesons may decay faster , with little absorption in atmosphere , decaying equally into @xmath9@xmath10 and @xmath2 , @xmath22 flavors , shining nearly isotropically ( out , of the upward earth opacity )",
    ": they may be the best source of terrestrial highest energy neutrino ; however these signals may provide only a small fraction ( @xmath44 ) among the @xmath1 icecube events @xcite . to describe in the following",
    "these observed @xmath9@xmath10 and @xmath2,@xmath22 flux we assumed an averaged @xmath32 shown in fig.[fig4 ] , fig.[fig5 ] , fig.[fig6 ] , fig.[fig7 ] .    the muon and electron flavor ratio @xmath45 metamorphosis as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath46 in gev unity , is shown in fig [ fig3 ] approximated by a simple analytical law that may meet at best the flavor behavior and icecube records .",
    "the main functions structure are three : @xmath47 function that describes the rise of the extraterrestrial neutrino component , whose cascades ( by one @xmath2 or by two @xmath48 ) fit the icecube data , @xmath49 keep memory of largest flavor difference , @xmath50 describes the fast extraterrestrial appearance : @xmath51 , @xmath52 ; @xmath53    @xmath54^{-1}\\ ] ] @xmath55^{-1}\\ ] ]    where the constant @xmath56 , the neutrino energy @xmath57 is in gev unity .",
    "the last two laws are for one showering flavor or for two , namely the unique @xmath2 or both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as long as the @xmath3 energy is below the few pev where double bang signature might be noticed .",
    "we wish to remind that up to now there are not yet any evidence of such twin event due to @xmath3 first nuclear interaction and later on @xmath26 decay .",
    "surprisingly , possibly , also for the third announced pev event . anyway the exponential decay term in @xmath50 stand for a rapid change of flavor at hundred tev .",
    "finally @xmath58^{-1}\\ ] ]    this flavor ratio evolution with energy @xmath45 is shown in ( see fig.[fig3 ] for one ( dashed ) or two flavors ) where both muon and electron atmospheric neutrino evolution is derived from the data ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) combined in the model above for the fluency in the following figure ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "the model and the data are combined in ( see fig.[fig6]),and in more detail are shown in last fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the dashed curve stand for one electron shower , the combined electron and tau are described by the continuous line .",
    ", @xmath22,@xmath3 @xmath23 flavor @xmath59,@xmath60 in @xmath61 unity , as a function of the neutrino energy in gev within a log - log graph .",
    "note that the horizontal twin dashed lines stand for the observed fluency at highest icecube energy for one or two flavor .",
    "the thin dashed curve describe the role of one ( of the two ) showering flavor fluency by present description model ]     for ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) showering cascades ( green crosses ) respect to same fluency for ( @xmath9 ) tracks ( blue continues curve ) for old sk , frejus and amanda as well as the recent icecube ( green crosses by deep core detector ) results , as a function of the energy in logarithmic - logarithmic scale @xcite .",
    "the last 28 highest energy event are somehow displayed .",
    "all data fit @xcite , @xcite , @xcite followed by our curve model to explain the icecube neutrino events . in the same figure at low figure area",
    "it is shown the flavor ratio as a function of the energy ; near hundred tev _ the sorpasso _ takes place ]     @xmath10 flux events @xcite overlap by our curve fit ; here we do not show the highest energy events shown in previous figure whose asymptotic fluency follow a dashed or bold dashed lines ]",
    "the energetic prompt atmospheric neutrinos can not oscillate much inside the terrestrial size and therefore they may keep the same primary ratio @xmath62 ; @xmath3 flavor flux is an order of magnitude smaller and maybe neglected .",
    "the expected prompt neutrino flavor ratio is @xmath63 .",
    "this ratio is much more suitable in explaining the sudden muon reduction than conventional ones .",
    "therefore one may wonder if the present flavor paradox maybe solved at best within a total prompt atmospheric neutrino scenario ; the probability that among @xmath1 events only @xmath6 are muon track is @xmath64 @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or just @xmath69 , while the cumulative probability that among @xmath1 events only @xmath6 or less are muon tracks is just @xmath70 .",
    "therefore a global prompt atmospheric neutrino role for icecube events can not solve much the flavor paradox .",
    "one may imagine , following a referee suggestion , that most atmospheric neutrino are hidden in the lower range , within 30 - 60 tev energy band ; among the higher energy 17 events ( 4 tracks , 13 showers ) above 60 tev only 4 events are muons tracks , implying , a negligible or none atmospheric pollution .",
    "however a more carefull analysis of each event seem still to disfavor this new interpretation even above 60 tev : among the 17 events two ( event i d 5 , i d 5 23 ) @xcite , seem very probable atmospheric ones because low energetic and very horizontal , leaving just 13 showers versus 2 tracks to be explained .",
    "the probability for such situation to occur is below @xmath71 ( assuming a probability of @xmath72 for track / shower ratio ) or below @xmath73 ( assuming a more realistic probability of @xmath74 for track / shower ratio due to the negligible role of nc)@xcite .    indeed the event n. 5 @xcite , a clear muon neutrino track , is nearly horizontal ( -0.4 degree ) and low energetic therefore it is very probably of atmospheric nature ; also events 23 ( -13.2 degree ) is like that .",
    "but , once again , the puzzle survive even more remarkable for those events at lower energies ( 60 tevs-30tev ) hidden into a limbo : ( 11 ) events that ( in principle ) should be mostly polluted by atmospheric muons and their atmospheric neutrinos ( @xmath4 ) . in this view this region ( 30tevs-60 tev ) one observe an unexpected ( 8) showers and 3 tracks versus a characteristic ( in early tev-10 tev range by deep core ) negligible showering rate ( 1 over 3 assuming nc ) ; for well known reasons it is better to say that the expected shower versus tracks in atmospheric dominated range is nearly 1 over 10 @xcite ) .",
    "the discontinuity in the flavor metamorphosis inside such a narrow energy range is even more surprising in view of the fast flavor variability ( from @xmath75 ) while showing in the same range a steady muon neutrino flux decay .",
    "therefore if the paradox is reduced in the high energy range it is strongly enhanced in lowest ones .    in conclusion to solve the puzzle",
    "there may be a growing role of extra - terrestrial neutrino all along the 30-tev - pev energy , leaving a marginal atmospheric @xmath18 role ; such transition should be ruling more and more ( 1 over ten ) on atmospheric ones , suggesting that the dominance occurs already at earlier energies , around 10 tev , as suggested in our articles ; otherwise , as the new proposal and the connected question marked in the title , a sudden flavor change at 30 - 60 tev seem unexplained : p(k=8,n=11 ) @xmath76 assuming a ratio @xmath77 for nc over a complete cc rate for most neutrino ; assuming a more realistically probability @xmath78 for nc ( at given energy ) over @xmath79 for cc interactions by atmospheric muon neutrino @xcite , the probability to occur is almost vanishing : @xmath80 @xmath81 : there is no room for an atmospheric hidden role in a @xmath15 tev energy band .",
    "otherwise the puzzle is even greater .",
    "extraterrestrial neutrinos ( by agn , grbs by jets or by uhecr via gzk cut off or their decay in flight , by prompt charmed interaction and decoherence ) may also rise at highest energy .",
    "their rate , almost comparable in each flavor after oscillation and mixing may pollute or even rule the neutrino highest energy edges .",
    "let us remind that the de - coherence of the @xmath18 flavors after oscillation depends on the primary rate and the flavor matrix discussed in recent articles @xcite , @xcite @xmath82 . for instance , for the gzk neutrinos , due to uhecr scattering on relic photons ,",
    "their flavors @xmath83 are born by photo - pion decays usually as @xmath84 ; because oscillation they reach us as @xmath85 .",
    "the consequent probability to occur as observed by icecube by @xmath0 cascades and @xmath6 tracks is @xmath86 , a realistic range .",
    "moreover the astrophysical neutrinos may also rise by proton proton scattering leading once again to a comparable final flavor population ; also astrophysical uhe neutrino maybe also be born as a prompt ones within @xmath87 @xmath88 reaching us after decoherence , at a ratio @xmath89 ; therefore @xmath2 , @xmath3 showering will already rule ( ignoring the neutral current role ) at @xmath90 ratio over all the events ( the muon tracks take place within a probability of @xmath91 ) , more consistently with the observed icecube showering - tracks @xmath92 ratio . if one takes into account also the neutral current ( leading to additional one third cascades at lower energies ) , the final ratio become : @xmath93 , a value even more consistent with data ( if at least one or two muons are indeed atmospheric ones ) . the probability that icecube events are born within such a prompt",
    "extraterrestrial origination is even more favorite because @xmath94 while previous @xmath85 _ democratic _ flavor distribution : @xmath86 , @xmath95 .",
    "finally we considered also a beta decay role where uhecr are radioactive heavy or lightest nuclei whose secondaries neutrino feed also astrophysical neutrino flux .",
    "the flavor ratio in such a beta decay flux scenario , is originally @xmath96 but the final flavor abundance after de - coherence becomes @xmath2 dominated @xmath97 . in this case the final rate probability for an electron or a tau whole showering is as large as @xmath98 for cascade over a much rarer @xmath99 muon track signature ; if one takes into account also nc cascades this ratio become slightly larger , @xmath100 a ratio at best compatible with the observed ones in icecube assuming just @xmath101 extraterrestrial event are muons : @xmath102 .",
    "_ in conclusion _ contrary to present icecube understanding the recent @xmath1 highest energy neutrinos @xcite might be _ mostly all of extraterrestrial origin _ ; atmospheric ones must have , we believe , a softer spectra than expected @xcite , even a factor ten . a few ( one - two )",
    "may be real atmospheric @xmath9 one as the horizontal ones ( see fig.[fig6 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) ; the other @xmath9 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 should be already extraterrestrial signals showering cascades more than tracing muon tracks . their flavor _ revolution _ require a transition from atmospheric to extraterrestrial ones already about ten tev .",
    "this imply a relevance in clustering and correlation map at a few ten tev energies .",
    "the muons crossing flux by @xmath9 at horizons or at vertical ( where earth opacity is still negligible ) may be a key meter to verify the expected overabundance of horizontal atmospheric neutrinos versus vertical ones ( at least an order of magnitude ) within @xmath103 of the upward horizons respect vertical ones , contrary to our foreseen mostly isotropic extraterrestrial flux .",
    "the number of such crossing events should be about few or several tens a year .",
    "the tens tev neutrino sky and clustering with the its flavor _ revolutions _ is a crucial cornerstone to solve icecube muon paucity puzzle . with more events",
    "a sharper sky map may better address us to the eventual galactic or extragalactic origination .",
    "antares , as large as twice deep core , might contain also rare cascades at few and tens tevs testing somehow the early flavor metamorphosis .",
