    "entanglement is a valuable resource that plays a key role in quantum information processing and transmission based on qubits @xcite or on continuous variable systems @xcite .",
    "it has also provided new insights into the role of quantum correlations in the critical behavior of many - body quantum systems @xcite . nonetheless , the evaluation of genuine quantum correlations for a given state of a many - body system is in general a difficult task . on the one hand ,",
    "rigorous computable entanglement measures exist just for pure states , where the entanglement entropy , i.e. the entropy of the reduced state of a subsystem , provides the basic measure of bipartite entanglement @xcite . in the case of mixed states ,",
    "rigorous measures like the entanglement of formation @xcite , which is the convex - roof extension of the previous measure @xcite , involve a minimization over a very high dimensional space of parameters and are therefore not directly computable .",
    "this has turned the attention to the negativity @xcite , or equivalently , the logarithmic negativity @xcite , which quantifies the violation of the positive partial transpose separability criterion by entangled states and is a bipartite entanglement monotone @xcite , computable in principle for any bipartition in any pure or mixed state .",
    "nevertheless , the accurate evaluation of these quantities demands a deep knowledge of the many body state , which requires in general an amount of information which increases exponentially with the system size .",
    "this fact limits the possibility of closed evaluations to states characterized by a manageable number of parameters @xcite .",
    "a prime example of such states are the _ gaussian states , _",
    "i.e. , ground or thermal states of stable gapped hamiltonians quadratic in boson operators , or equivalently generalized coordinates and momenta @xcite . for such states , of crucial importance for continuous variable quantum information @xcite ,",
    "the entanglement entropy of bipartitions of pure states and the negativity between arbitrary subsystems in pure or mixed states can be evaluated in terms of the elements of the covariance matrix @xcite , i.e. , of the generalized contraction matrix of pairs of boson operators @xcite .",
    "however , even in this scenario , the extraction of analytic expressions for these quantities for arbitrary subsystems is in general not straightforward @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to discuss the evaluation of the previous measures in weakly correlated gaussian states , such as typical ground states of gapped hamiltonians , which can be characterized by excitations over a product state .",
    "gaussian states are usually described in terms of the phase space formalism @xcite , which allows to connect their entanglement properties with correlations in phase space . here",
    "we will consider a different approach , based on the fock representation , which provides an equivalent yet in many cases more clear way to evaluate and represent entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "we will show that the entanglement entropy and negativity can be expressed in terms of the singular values of sub - blocks of basic contraction matrices , which can be evaluated analytically in the perturbative limit for some typical couplings .",
    "the formalism also allows the straightforward derivation of area laws @xcite for these quantities .",
    "the emergent area laws for the entanglement entropy and negativity are different , i.e. , they depend on distinct measures of the boundary size , and are affected by the orientation and separation of the subsystems .",
    "let us also remark that the ground state of weakly interacting spin systems can also be described by gaussian states through different approximate bosonization techniques @xcite , entailing that the scope of the present scheme is quite general .",
    "the formalism is described in section ii , while section iii considers its application to specific systems , essentially ground states of two dimensional lattices with short range couplings , although the full range case is also considered .",
    "the present scheme allows to easily obtain exact analytic asymptotic expressions for the entanglement entropy and logarithmic negativity of different types of bipartitions and block pairs , both contiguous and separated , which will be compared with exact numerical results .",
    "they clearly show the emergence of precise area laws .",
    "conclusions are finally drawn in iv .",
