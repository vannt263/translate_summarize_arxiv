    "<S> how dust scatters and absorbs starlight in the interstellar medium ( ism ) contains important clues about the size and composition of interstellar dust . </S>",
    "<S> while the ultraviolet ( uv ) and visible interstellar extinction is well studied and can be closely fitted in terms of various dust mixtures ( e.g. , the silicate - graphite mixture ) , the infrared ( ir ) extinction is not well understood , particularly , the mid - ir extinction in the 38@xmath0 wavelength range is rather flat ( or `` gray '' ) and is inconsistent with the standard mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck ( mrn ) silicate - graphite dust model . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to reproduce the flat ir extinction by exploring various dust sizes and species , including amorphous silicate , graphite , amorphous carbon and iron . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the flat ir extinction is best explained in terms of micrometer - sized amorphous carbon dust which consumes @xmath160 carbon atoms per million hydrogen atoms ( i.e. , c / h@xmath260ppm ) . to account for the observed </S>",
    "<S> uv / visible and near - ir extinction , the silicate - graphite model requires si / h@xmath234ppm and c / h@xmath2292ppm . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the extinction from the uv to the mid - ir could be closely reproduced by a mixture of submicrometer - sized amorphous silicate dust , submicrometer - sized graphitic dust , and micrometer - sized amorphous carbon dust , at the expense of excess c available in the ism ( i.e. , this model requires a solid - phase c abundance of c / h@xmath2352ppm , considerably exceeding what could be available in the ism ) .    infrared , extinction , dust , model </S>"
