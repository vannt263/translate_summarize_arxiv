    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is a low - metalicity irregular dwarf galaxy and a satellite of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "since the metallicity of the lmc ( which is only @xmath141/4 of that of the mw ; @xcite ) is similar to that of galaxies at red shifts @xmath15 @xcite , it offers opportunities to study the dust properties in distant low - metallicity extragalactic environments by studying the extinction properties of the lmc .    the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction",
    " `` interstellar extinction law ( or curve ) ''  is one of the primary sources of information about the interstellar grain population @xcite . in the mw , the interstellar extinction laws in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and visual wavelength ranges vary from sightline to sightline , and can be characterized by the optical total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the interstellar reddening , @xmath18 is the extinction at the visual ( @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ) band , and @xmath21 is the extinction at the blue ( @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ) band .",
    "the regional variations of the uv / visual extinction curves ( i.e. , the variations of the @xmath24 values ) reflect the variations in dust size : larger @xmath24 values indicate the predominance of larger grains @xcite .",
    "however , the infrared ( ir ) interstellar extinction laws of the mw , which also vary from one sightline to another , can not be simply represented by the single @xmath24 parameter .",
    "many recent studies show that there does not exist a `` universal '' near - infrared ( nir ) extinction law for the mw @xcite . moreover , the observationally - determined mid - infrared ( mir ) extinction law shows a flat curve while classical dust models for the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) predict a much steeper curve , with a pronounced minimum at @xmath147@xmath1 @xcite . and by `` mir '' we mean @xmath25 . ]    due to its low metallicity , the dust quantity ( relative to h ) in the lmc is expected to be lower than that of the mw because there is less raw material ( i.e. , heavy elements ) available for making the dust .",
    "the ( relative ) lack of the dust - making raw material could prevent the dust in the lmc from growing and hence the dust in the lmc may be smaller than the mw dust . furthermore , the star - formation activity in the lmc could destroy the dust .",
    "therefore , one would naturally expect the dust size distribution and extinction curve in the lmc to differ from that of the mw .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : mwlmcsmc ] , the galactic interstellar extinction curve rises from the nir to the near - uv with a broad absorption bump at about @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , and continues rising steeply into the far - uv @xcite . in the small magellanic cloud ( smc )",
    ", the extinction curves of most sightlines display a nearly linear steep rise with @xmath28 and lack the 2175@xmath29 hump @xcite .",
    "the lmc extinction curve is intermediate between that of the mw and that of the smc : compared to the galactic extinction curve , the lmc extinction curve is characterized by a _ weaker _ 2175@xmath29 hump and a _ stronger _ far - uv rise @xcite .",
    "strong regional variations in extinction properties have also been found in the lmc @xcite : the sightlines toward the stars inside or near the supergiant shell , lmc2 , which lies on the southeast side of the 30 doradus star - forming region , have a very weak 2175@xmath29 hump @xcite , while the extinction curves for the sightlines toward the stars which are @xmath30500pc away from the 30 doradus region are closer to the galactic extinction curve . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath31 for the lmc2 supershell and @xmath32 for the lmc as a whole .",
    "the sightlines outside 30 doradus have @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "@xcite had already noticed that the average value of @xmath24 in the lmc ( @xmath34 ) is close ( within 10% ) to that of the mw ( @xmath35 .",
    "we note that the ccm parameterization controlled by the single @xmath24-parameter is not valid for the lmc extinction curve @xcite , i.e. , even the lmc and the mw are close in @xmath24 , their extinction curves differ appreciably .",
    "@xcite derived the nir extinction law of the lmc based on the nir photometry at the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 bands of early type supergiants .",

    "their results correspond to @xmath47 when converted to the 2mass photmetric system @xcite . because of this , the galactic nir extinction law is sometimes adopted for the lmc ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using the near - infrared color - excess ( nice ) method @xcite , @xcite calculated the nir extinction coefficients of the lmc to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 , corresponding to @xmath50 , which is roughly consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "we note that although the lmc nir extinction law is commonly assumed to be universal , @xcite showed that it also differs between the lmc2 supershell and the lmc average ( see their table  4 ) .",
    "so far , little efforts have been put into the mir extinction properties of the lmc due to the paucity of mir data .",

    "the data used in this work were obtained through the _ spitzer_/sage legacy program , entitled `` _ _ spitzer _ _ survey of the large magellanic cloud : surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution '' @xcite .",
    "the sage legacy program mapped the lmc at two different epochs ( epochs 1 and 2 ) separated by three months , using the irac ( [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0]@xmath52 ) and mips ( [ 24 ] , [ 70 ] , and [ 160]@xmath52 ) instruments on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "the sage points source catalog , named sagelmccatalogirac , released in september 2009 , combined both epochs data bandmerged with 2mass and 6x2mass all - sky data @xcite .",
    "the sagelmccatalogirac catalog is the sage catalog with the highest quality , providing @xmath146.4 million point sources at four irac bands and three 2mass or 6x2mass bands .",
    "faint limits are 18.1 , 17.5 , 15.3 , and 14.2@xmath53 for irac [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0]@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the sage data also provide the catalogs , such as sagelmccatalogmips24 , sagelmccatalogmips70 and sagelmccatalogmips160 , which include the sources observed by _ spitzer_/mips at [ 24 ] , [ 70 ] , and [ 160]@xmath52 bands .",
    "however , only irac data are used in this work for probing the lmc mir extinction .",
    "we only select the sources with a signal - to - noise ratio of s / n@xmath545 at all three 2mass bands and four irac bands ( see  [ tracer ] for details on sample selection ) .",

    "spitzer_/irac , there are @xmath56 sources in sagelmccatalogirac with s / n@xmath545 at all seven bands ( see figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "additionally , @xcite estimated that the galactic foreground stars and background galaxies contribute roughly 18% and 12% of the sage catalog sources .",
    "toward the lmc , many studies have showed that the mean foreground galactic reddening is @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the average galactic extinction across the lmc at the visual band to be @xmath58 , implying @xmath57 with the galactic average value of @xmath59 .",

    "@xcite found the foreground reddening @xmath60 toward 30 doradus , while the inner reddening in this area exceeds 0.14@xmath53 . ]",
    "we correct for the foreground extinction at each 2mass band , taking the foreground visual extinction to be @xmath61 @xcite for all the lmc sources . to see how much the extinction will change using different foreground extinction ,",

    "taking these foreground extinction quantities to correct the observed magnitude , there is little change to the derived lmc nir extinction ( compared to that with @xmath61 ) : the difference is @xmath672.1% and @xmath672.3% for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , while the lmc mir extinction @xmath70 at [ 3.6]@xmath1 , [ 5.8]@xmath1 , and [ 8.0]@xmath1 would decrease by @xmath1416% , 24% , and 33% , respectively .",
    "if neglecting the foreground reddening ( i.e. , taking @xmath71 ) , the derived nir extinction also changes little ( @xmath671.3% , @xmath670.7% ) , while the mir extinction at [ 3.6]@xmath1 , [ 5.8]@xmath1 , and [ 8.0]@xmath1 would increase by @xmath140.8% , 6.4% , and 9.2% , respectively .",
    "the extinction at the [ 4.5]@xmath1 band is more complicated * ( see  [ ice45])*. ] we take the wavelength - dependence of the foreground extinction to be that of the @xmath59 galactic average extinction law @xcite , i.e. , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",

    "as mentioned in  1 the lmc uv / visual extinction exhibits substantial regional variation , particularly among sightlines toward stars in and outside the 30 doradus region .",
    "little is known about the mir extinction of the lmc and its variation toward different sightlines , until the _ spitzer_/sage database offers us the unique opportunity . as",
    "the mir extinction is generally small , to probe the mir extinction efficiently we favor the lmc regions with large @xmath18 ( after all , only these highly obscured regions need to be corrected for ir extinction ) .",
    "previous studies have estimated that the mean lmc reddening varies from @xmath81 to @xmath82 ( see table  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite constructed the visual extinction ( @xmath18 ) map and found the mean value of @xmath18 is @xmath140.38@xmath53 .",
    "@xcite constructed extinction maps for two stellar populations in the central 64 @xmath83 area of the lmc , and derived the average extinction of @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the cold and hot populations , respectively .",
    "@xcite developed a new method by using the color of the _ x _ percentile reddest stars and derived a new @xmath18 map of the lmc , which is similar to the integrated intensity of the co emission as observed by the nanten telescope @xcite .",
    "all these extinction maps showed that the maximum @xmath18 of the lmc is close to @xmath145@xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath86 ( the extinction at the @xmath2 band relative to @xmath18 ) , for @xmath87 @xmath88 is only @xmath140.1@xmath53 . the mean measurement uncertainty of the 2mass survey is @xmath890.109mag for the @xmath2 magnitude ( snr=1 ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to only consider the regions with @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , the lmc areas containing special structures ( such as bar or molecular ridge ) and some special interstellar environments also need to be considered in order to probe the variation of mir extinction among different interstellar environments .",
    "@xcite investigated the mid- to far - ir emission of the lmc based on the _ cobe_/dirbe and _ iras _ sky survey atlas data . in their figure  12",
    ", they illustrated the local structures in the molecular ridge ( mr ) and the co arc in the lmc .",
    "these structures are associated with the co molecular clouds , as well as the highly obscured regions in the extinction map derived by @xcite .",
    "combining @xcite s extinction map and @xcite s figure  12 with the nanten @xmath91co map @xcite , we select five regions with large @xmath18 in the lmc molecular clouds and mr and arc structures ( see the red boxes in figure  [ fig : fields ] ; in the following we will call these five regions `` the first five regions '' ) . although the average @xmath18 is smaller than 1@xmath53 or even much smaller , the regions in the lmc bar and hi area ( marked as blue boxes in figure  [ fig : fields ] ) are also considered for comparison .",
    "all these seven regions are listed in table  [ tab : field ] labeled with the structure name and the molecular cloud number .",
    "the determination of dust extinction is most commonly made by comparing the flux densities of obscured and unobscured pair stars of the same spectral type @xcite . in this work",
    "we adopt the `` color - excess '' method to obtain the extinction .",
    "the `` color - excess '' method is widely applied to photometric data and can probe deeper than the spectrum - pair method . for doing this ,",
    "a group of sources which have essentially the same intrinsic color indices ( or with very small scattering in the color indices ) are chosen .",
    "this method calculates the ratio of the two color excesses which can be expressed as following @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the magnitude in the interested band @xmath94 ; @xmath95 is the magnitude in the reference band @xmath96 ( taken to be the @xmath2 band in this work ) ; @xmath97 is magnitude in the comparison band @xmath98 ( taken to be the j band in this work ) .",
    "therefore , the extinction ratio of the @xmath99 band to the @xmath2 reference band is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is used to derive @xmath102 from @xmath103 and can be obtained by fitting the observed color indices @xmath104 and @xmath105 with a linear line @xcite .",
    "the slope of the fitted linear line is @xmath106 .",
    "this is a statistical method as it makes use of a large number of sources and reduces the risk of depending on any individual objects with large uncertainties in the determination of their intrinsic color indices . in figure",

    "@xcite obtained @xmath110 for the lmc2 supershell near 30 doradus .",
    "we adopt @xmath111 since the regions selected for this study are near 30 doradus ( co-186 ) ( see figure  [ fig : fields ] ) . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also take the galatcic value of @xmath112 @xcite which is often adopted to study the lmc extinction @xcite .      in our previous work of probing the variation of the mir extinction law in the galactic plane @xcite , red giant branch stars ( rgbs )",
    "were used as the tracer to study the extinction law at the four irac bands . in the ir ,",
    "red giants are appropriate tracers of interstellar extinction for the following reasons : ( i ) they have a narrow range of effective temperatures so that the scatter of their intrinsic color indices is small ; ( ii ) they are bright in the ir ( @xmath113 ) and remain visible even suffering large extinction and/or observed from a great distance , even in the lmc .    in the lmc ,",
    "rgb stars are one of the most prominent and well populated features in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of stellar populations with ages larger than @xmath141.52.0gyr @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a morphological analysis on the 2mass cmd of the lmc and distinguished different populations of stars in the lmc .",
    "the populations were identified based on isochrone fitting and matching the theoretical cmd colors of known populations to the observed cmd source density ( see figure  3 and tables  2 , 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite selected the sources in _ regions _ e , f , g , h , j , l , and part of _ region _ d of @xcite to derive the extinction map of the lmc .",
    "they eliminated _ regions _ a , b , c , and i , which contain much foreground contamination .",
    "although it is free of foreground contamination , _ region _ k is also eliminated because it consists of dusty agb stars whose large @xmath114 colors are due to circumstellar dust .",
    "however , the sources considered by @xcite contain too many different stellar populations .",
    "we note that _ region _ e of @xcite , located within @xmath115 and @xmath116 , covers the upper rgb and includes the tip of the rgb .",
    "therefore , we choose a slightly expanded version of _ region _ e to select the rgb stars : the selected region is constrained to @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( see figures  [ fig : cmd],[fig : rgb186 ] ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that evolved red giants may have circumstellar dust shells which would cause circumstellar extinction and produce ir emission , hence affecting our understanding of their intrinsic color indices .",
    "additionally , the selected region ( _ region _ e ) may contain other populations which will affect the extinction determination .",
    "for the mw , astronomers commonly use @xmath119-[4.5]$]@xmath1200.6 and @xmath121-[8.0]$]@xmath1200.2 as the criteria to exclude the sources with ir excess such as pre - main - sequence stars and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite . for the lmc , @xcite presented initial results on the epoch  1 data of the _ spitzer_/sage program for a region near n79 and n83 , which is near the southwest end of the lmc bar .",
    "they adopt a simplified point - source classification to identify three candidate groups  stars without dust , dusty evolved stars , and young stellar objects ( ysos ) on the mir color - color diagrams . in their figure  11 and figure  12 , @xcite showed the stars without dust are almost constrained to @xmath119 - [ 4.5 ] < 0.0 $ ] , @xmath121 - [ 8.0 ] < 0.5 $ ] .",

    "@xcite derived the nir extinction coefficient of the lmc using the nice method @xcite and the nicer ( nice revised ) method @xcite .",
