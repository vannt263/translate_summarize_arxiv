    "the goal of quantum state tomography  @xcite is to estimate , from a series of projective measurements performed on identically prepared quantum systems , the density matrix of the underlying ensemble of which these quantum systems are realizations .",
    "this process is necessarily non - deterministic in nature , relying on the frequency of experimental outcomes to estimate probabilities - a process that converges to the actual probabilities only in the infinite limit .",
    "thus the reconstruction of the quantum state can not be exact in any realistic experiment .",
    "furthermore , these measurements can only yield estimates of the on - diagonal elements of the density matrix , but not directly any data about the off - diagonal elements .",
    "it is necessary to perform various unitary operations on the system ( or , equivalently to perform projective measurements in a variety of bases ) in order to obtain such information about the complete state .",
    "indeed , for a system with a discrete spectrum of @xmath0-levels , the density matrix is specified by @xmath1 independent real parameters , and each parameter will require a separate measurement . even after the required measurements have been performed , the experimenter faces the problem of estimating the density matrix from incomplete and noisy data .",
    "the problem is aggravated by the constraints that quantum physics places on the density matrix : it must be a non - negative , unit - trace hermitian matrix .",
    "today , the approach that is usually taken is to determine computationally what is the ` best ' such positive , unit - trace hermitian matrix which corresponds to a particular data set , and what confidence can we place on such an estimate .",
    "the most complicated such tomographic measurement performed to date  @xcite , on an 8 qubit ( 256 state ) system , realized in a trapped ion experiment , was _ limited not by the experimental capabilities of the system , but rather by the complexity of the numerical state recovery problem _",
    "this computational complexity , while underscoring the awesome computational potential inherent in quantum information , nevertheless presents an experimenter , intent on exploring larger and larger hilbert spaces , with considerable tribulation when characterising the performance of his or her apparatus .    in this paper",
    "we examine the problem from an entirely computational perspective .",
    "specifically , we address the concern that maybe we are being too fastidious in approaching the state reconstruction problem .",
    "one can obtain a positive , unit - trace hermitian matrix from tomographic data in a variety of ways .",
    "first , and most simply , one could generate a linear reconstruction of the noisy data ( which tends to give a non - positive matrix ) , and ensure positivity by setting the negative eigenvalues to zero , then re - normalizing to ensure a unit - trace .",
    "this we call the  quick and dirty \" ( qd ) approach .",
    "a second strategy is to assume the state must be nearly pure - after all , quantum technologies are usually in the business of trying to create pure states - and to simplify the computation by finding the pure state most compatible with the data .",
    "we call this the `` forced purity '' ( fp ) approach .",
    "a third approach is full optimization , i.e. the application of some constrained optimization routine , with a specific metric to define the ` distance ' between our data set and a positive density matrix , and search parameter space until the absolute ` best ' ( i.e. global minimum ) density matrix is obtained .",
    "our goal is specifically to address the question : when is the rigorous optimization required , and when will some short - cut technique be good enough ?",
    "this is a question that can only be addressed by simulation : since we need to know _ a priori _ the underlying density matrix of the ensemble to compare the recovered estimates .",
    "starting with assumed density matrix , we employ a pseudo - random number generator to create some ` pseudo - experimental data ' with appropriate probability distribution .",
    "the various approaches to density matrix recovery are applied to it , and the result is compared with the initial density matrix to assess the accuracy of the recovery techniques .",
    "our analysis concerns solely multiple correlated two - level systems , e.g. the qubits of a small scale quantum computer ; however , many of the techniques and results we present are readily adaptable to more general systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : one - qubit ] we discuss the generic tomography problem for a single qubit , which is generalized to the n - qubit case in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalization - to - n - qubits ] , describing specifically a number of memory management techniques required for scalability of the code , and our novel approach to the optimization routine ( using gradient - based algorithms and employing the matrix differential calculus ) .",
    "the code itself is described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : description - of - code ] , and our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "in this section , we will review the basic concept of quantum state tomography by considering the estimation of a state of a single two - level system , or qubit .",
    "the density operator describing the state of a system  @xcite is a hermitian , non - negative definite operator of unit - trace .",
    "the set of pauli matrices  @xcite @xmath2 form , for a two dimensional space , a complete orthonormal set of matrices , so that @xmath3 can be expanded as a linear combination of @xmath4 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 since @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; further , since @xmath9 , the @xmath10 are all real parameters .",
    "the @xmath10 may be determined experimentally as follows : suppose we perform a measurement , specified by the projector @xmath11 , on the system , the probability of obtaining a positive outcome is @xmath12 . repeating this measurement @xmath13 times on identically prepared systems",
    ", the expected number of times we obtain this outcome will be @xmath14 if one repeated this procedure of multiple measurements for a set of four different measurement operators , @xmath15 one obtains a set of linear equations @xmath16 where @xmath17 by choosing the measurement operators , @xmath18 , judiciously , one can ensure that @xmath19 is non - singular , and hence that the desired parameters @xmath20 can be obtained from the observed quantities @xmath21 , viz .",
    ", @xmath22 substituting @xmath10 into eq .",
    ", we obtain the density matrix , as a function of measurement outcomes , _ provided the measurements have no noise or errors in them_.    following the precedent of ref .",
    "@xcite we use the standard stokes measurement basis for our numerical experiments .",
    "these measurement operators are given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the two states of our qubits , and @xmath26 with the actual density matrix @xmath27 is the _ fidelity _",
    "@xcite , defined as : @xmath28\\}^{2}.\\label{eq : fidelity}\\ ] ] however , when we invert the measurement data linearly , our recovered `` density matrix '' @xmath29 is not non - negative definite and hence we have the specific problem that fidelity turns out to be complex ( not to mention the more general problem that @xmath29 can not be interpreted as a density matrix of a physical state ) .",
    "we have to correct the matrix obtained by linear reconstruction to obtain a proper density matrix .      as a simple initial approach to this problem , we can decompose @xmath29 into its spectral representation , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues ( which are real , but not necessarily positive ) and @xmath32 is a unitary matrix .",
    "we then set all negative eigenvalues in @xmath31 to zero , call this matrix @xmath33 , and obtain : @xmath34 this provides a rough initial estimate of the state ; one of the goals of our analysis in this paper is to assess how good an estimate it is .",
    "an alternative approach to the problem of obtaining a non - negative definite density matrix from measured data is to assume that the state is _",
    "pure_. recall that for a pure state @xmath35 the density matrix can be described by a single ket as @xmath36 .",
    "such a density matrix for @xmath0 qubits has eigenvalue @xmath37 with degeneracy @xmath38 and eigenvalue @xmath39 with degeneracy @xmath39 .",
    "because @xmath40 is also hermitian , it can be written in its spectral decomposition as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the diagonal matrix with a single element equal to @xmath39 , and all other elements being zero ; @xmath43 is a unitary matrix .    during linear inversion of a pure state",
    ", the eigenvalues of @xmath29 may be negative , but sufficiently close to eigenvalues of @xmath40 .",
    "the idea of forcing purity on such a state is to obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the diagonal matrix obtained from @xmath31 by setting the largest eigenvalue equal to @xmath39 , and all others equal to @xmath37 .",
    "any hermitian @xmath46 non - negative unit - trace matrix can be uniquely parametrized using the cholesky decomposition as :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 thus a ` physical ' density matrix can be specified by the four parameters @xmath49 .",
    "the ideal of the maximum likelihood method is to perform a search of the @xmath50 parameter space until we find a @xmath51 which is most likely to have generated the observed data @xmath52 . to assess this likelihood ,",
    "suppose that each datum @xmath53 is a statistically independent , poisson - distributed random variable with expectation value @xmath54 .",
    "further , if @xmath54 is a large number , the poisson distribution is well approximated by the gaussian distribution , i.e. @xmath55 , \\label{fredflinstone}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the normalization constant .",
    "if each datum @xmath53 is garnered from @xmath13 repetitions of a measurement carried out on a system in state @xmath51 , it is reasonable to make the identification @xmath57 , and the likelihood of a given parameter vector @xmath50 generating the data @xmath52 can be obtained by substituting this identity into eq .  .",
    "we are then in a position to determine the parameter vector for which this probability is maximized , and hence the most likely density matrix . instead of maximizing eq .  , it is equivalent , and mathematically more convenient to minimize the following function : @xmath58^{2 }          } {      { \\cal n}tr\\{\\hat{\\pi}_{\\nu}\\hat{\\rho}_\\mathrm{ideal}(\\vec{t})\\ }          } .",
    "\\label{eq : l - fn}\\ ] ]    in order to optimize this function efficiently , we need to compute its gradient .",
    "this is not an easy feat , as the closed analytic form does not simplify well , and finite - differencing is too inefficient .",
    "the situation becomes exponentially worse as we increase the number of qubits .",
    "in the previous section , we outlined the possible routines for performing tomography of a single qubit .",
    "we now extend these routines to a higher number of qubits and see how the  quick and dirty \" and  forced purity \" methods compare to the elaborate and time - consuming maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) routine .    at first , the problem looks very simple - any state of each qubit is completely characterized by only 4 measurements .",
    "hence , numerically the mle procedure is rather easy to implement - we just need to optimize a function of 4 variables , which is achieved by the simplex or powell optimization algorithm in a fairly short amount of time  @xcite , without computing the gradient .",
    "however , two qubits , when correlated , are not characterized by 8 measurements , but by @xmath59 measurements , because we are looking at a _ system _ of 2 qubits . if _",
    "n _ is the number of qubits , then we would need to obtain @xmath60 measurement outcomes in some fixed @xmath60 dimensional basis . due to wave function collapse",
    ", we can only perform one projection measurement at a time ( an outcome is an average over multiple identical projection measurements ) and for each projection measurement on one qubit , we have to cycle through all possible combinations of projection measurements for the other qubits .",
    "let us introduce the following set of operators which generalize the pauli matrices for @xmath0 qubit systems : @xmath61 where @xmath62 for all @xmath63 are the digits of the index @xmath64 in base-4 .",
    "for example , if @xmath65 for a 4-qubit system , @xmath66 , since @xmath67 is equal to @xmath68 in base-4 . for convenience",
    ", we have included a normalization constant , so that @xmath69 ( in keeping with the convention used in ref .",
    "similarly , we write the projection operators for our measurement states as @xmath70 the cholesky decomposition of @xmath3 remains the same , except that @xmath71 is a @xmath72 matrix specified by @xmath73 parameters @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75.\\ ] ]      in order to perform computational numerical tomography in practice , we need to take the following into consideration :    1 .   computational efficiency - what is the upper bound on the number of floating point operations of a certain tomography algorithm .",
    "2 .   amount of memory available - what is the upper bound on the size in computer memory of the largest data structure used by the tomography algorithm .",
    "kronecker tensor products increase the size of resultant matrices exponentially .",
    "the goal is to obtain the density matrix which has @xmath76 elements .",
    "so we can not have any other data structure in memory which would be larger , otherwise the problem of increasing the number of qubits becomes constrained by that particular data structure .",
