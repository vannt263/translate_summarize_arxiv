    "many extensions of the standard model , including supergravity and string theory , exploit the kaluza - klein idea that the true dimensionality of space - time is @xmath2 , where the additional @xmath3 spatial dimensions are compactified at some small length scale . for a long time",

    "the corresponding energy scale @xmath7gev is so high that direct experimental observation of the effects of extra dimensions would seem impossible at any time in the foreseeable future .",
    "the situation changed dramatically with the proposal of models for which the compactification energy may be as low as the extra - dimensional planck energy scale , @xmath8 , which is assumed to be of order 1tev @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath9 is the fundamental gravitational constant in the extended @xmath10-dimensional space - time ) .",
    "note that this proposal eliminates the hierarchy problem since the characteristic energy scales of gravitational and gauge interactions coincide . in order to be consistent with observations ,",
    "the usual gauge fields of the standard model are presumed to exist on 4-dimensional branes whereas gravity alone propagates into the @xmath10-dimensional bulk .",
    "constraints on these new lower energy scale compactification models can be obtained by investigating their predictions in accelerator experiments @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "more model - independent limits , however , can be obtained from tests of newtonian gravity . in extra - dimensional models with large compact extra dimensions @xcite ,",
    "the newtonian gravitational potential acting between two point masses acquires a yukawa correction for separations much larger than the compactification scale @xcite , while for models with non - compact but warped extra dimensions , the corrections are power - laws @xcite . for two interacting macroscopic bodies ,",
    "either of these corrections would give rise to a new ( so called `` fifth '' ) force coexisting with the usual newtonian gravitational force and other conventional standard model interactions , such as casimir and van der waals forces .",
    "in addition , many extensions of the standard model that do not involve extra dimensions also predict the existence of new yukawa or power - law forces .    while gravity experiments at ranges @xmath11  m have found no convincing evidence of new forces or extra - dimensions , tests of newtonian gravity over shorter separations were lacking until recently . during the past few years",
    "a number of sub - millimeter gravity experiments were performed and stronger constraints on yukawa corrections to newtonian gravity for ranges @xmath12 m have been obtained @xcite . for significantly smaller separations , however , gravity loses its role as the dominant force acting between non - magnetic , electrically neutral interacting bodies . for these smaller separations , limits on new forces and extra - dimensions from force measurements",

    "improvements in the precision of casimir force measurements coincided with the development of modern extra - dimensional theories .",

    "although these new precision measurements of the casimir force were not especially designed or optimized to obtain stronger constraints on the predictions of extra - dimensional physics , some of them were used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "this resulted in a strengthening of previously known constraints by a factor as large as 4500 in some regions within the range @xmath13 m to @xmath14 m .",
    "this means that casimir force measurements have become a powerful competitor to both accelerator and gravitational experiments in constraining theoretical models of high energy physics .",
    "in contrast to astrophysical and cosmological constraints , the results of casimir force measurements are less model dependent , reproducible , and therefore more reliable .",
    "in this paper we present detailed results of new , increased precision , casimir force measurements between a cu - coated plate and an au - coated sphere ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for preliminary data ) .",
    "the use of a microelectromechanical torsional oscillator ( mto ) and of interferometric measurements of the sphere - plate separations permitted much higher sensitivity to be achieved than in previous casimir force experiments .",
    "a careful error analysis has been performed , and the experimental precision was determined at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the complete theory of the casimir force , taking into account finite conductivity and surface roughness corrections has been applied to the experimental configuration .",
    "the finite conductivity corrections were computed by the use of the lifshitz formula @xcite and tabulated optical data for the complex index of refraction .",
    "the surface roughness was modelled using atomic force microscope ( afm ) images of the interacting surfaces .",

    "several theories predicting large thermal corrections to the casimir force at small separations @xcite were evaluated for our experiment .",

    "in our experiment , the casimir force between two dissimilar metals ( gold and copper ) was measured using a mto operating in both static and dynamic modes . in the static regime",
    "the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and a cu - coated plate of the mto was measured . in the dynamic regime the vertical separation between the sphere and the plate was changed harmonically with time .",
    "this leads to a measurement of the @xmath15-derivative of the casimir force , which is equivalent to measuring the casimir force per unit area , or the casimir pressure , for a configuration of two parallel plates ( see below ) .",
    "note that the dynamic measurement technique is used here to measure the usual ( static ) casimir effect .",
    "hence , this measurement is unrelated to the so - called dynamic casimir effect which arises from the velocity dependent casimir forces or the creation of photons by the rapidly oscillating plates @xcite .",
    "when using mechanical oscillators to measure forces , one has to confront the coupling of the oscillator with environmental vibrations .",
    "compared with cantilever oscillators , torsional oscillators are less sensitive to mechanical vibrations that induce a motion of the center of mass .",
    "furthermore , the miniaturization of the oscillators yields an improvement in its quality factor and sensitivity @xcite .",
    "it is consequently advantageous to use an electromechanical torsional oscillator to measure the casimir force between two metals .",
    "the experimental arrangement is shown schematically in fig .",
    "the mto is made of a 3.5@xmath0 m thick , 500@xmath16 500@xmath0m@xmath17 heavily doped polysilicon plate suspended at two opposite points by serpentine springs , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ circuit ] .",
    "the springs are anchored to a silicon nitride ( sin@xmath18 ) covered si platform . when no torques are applied the plate is separated from the platform by a gap @xmath19 m .",
    "two independently contacted polysilicon electrodes located under the plate are used to measure the capacitance between the electrodes and the plate . for the mto employed in this experiment , we calculated the torsion coefficient @xmath20nm / rad @xcite ,",
    "where @xmath21 m is the width of the serpentine , @xmath22 m is its thickness , @xmath23 m its length , and @xmath24 gpa is young s modulus for si .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the measured value @xmath25  nm / rad .",
    "the edges of the plate are coated with 1 nm of cr followed by 200 nm of cu .",
    "this layer of cu constitutes one of the metals used in the measurement of the casimir force .",
    "the remainder of the assembly , as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] , consists of an au - coated al@xmath26o@xmath27 sphere that can be brought in close proximity to the cu - coated plate .",
    "al@xmath26o@xmath27 spheres with nominal diameters ranging from 100@xmath0 m to 600@xmath0 m were coated with a @xmath28 nm layer of cr followed by a @xmath29 nm layer of gold . the coated sphere used in the experiment",
    "was subsequently glued with conductive epoxy to the side of an au - coated optical fiber , establishing an electrical connection between them .",
    "the sphericity of the al@xmath26o@xmath27 balls , as measured on a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , was found to be within the specifications of the manufacturer . as an example",

    "was rigidly mounted into a can , where a pressure @xmath31torr was maintained . the can has built - in magnetic damping vibration isolation and was , in turn , mounted onto an air table .",
    "this combination of vibration isolation systems yielded base vibrations with @xmath32 nm for frequencies above 100hz .",
    "the fiber - sphere assembly was moved vertically by the combination of a micrometer - driven and a piezo - driven stage .",
    "the mto was mounted on a piezoelectric driven _ xyz _ stage which , in turn , is mounted on a micrometer controlled _ xy _ stage .",
    "this combination allows positioning the au - coated sphere over the cu - coated plate .",
    "the separation @xmath33 between the sphere and the si - platform was controlled by the @xmath15-axis of the _ xyz _ stage .",
    "a two color fiber interferometer - based closed - loop system was used to keep @xmath33 constant .",
    "the error in the interferometric measurements was found to be @xmath34 nm , dominated by the overall stability of the closed - loop feedback system .",
    "since this error is much greater than the actual mechanical vibrations of the system , the closed loop was turned off while data acquisition was in progress .",
    "the separation @xmath35 between the two metallic surfaces ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the lever arm between the sphere and the axis of the mto , and @xmath38 is the angle between the platform and the plate ( @xmath39 has been used ) .",
    "@xmath40 is the distance the bottom of the sphere protrudes from the end of the cleaved fiber , and @xmath41 includes the gap between the platform and the plate , the thickness of the plate , and the thickness of the cu layer .",

    "the best previous constraints were obtained from old measurements of the casimir force between dielectrics which are not as precise or reliable as those obtained here from the casimir pressure measurements between metals using an mto .    turning to the power - law - type hypothetical interactions given by eq .",
    "( [ eq29 ] ) , the present experiment does not lead to improved constraints .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the metallic coatings used were too thin ( and hence , too light ) to give a significant contribution to hypothetical interactions with a longer interaction range .",
    "in fact , the thicker ( bulk ) matter contributes more significantly in this case , even though its density is much lower than for the metal coatings . to obtain stronger constraints on the constants characterizing new power - law interactions , thicker metal coatings and larger interacting bodies are preferable .",
    "we anticipate that future measurements of the casimir force will employ such samples .",
    "our primary objective in the present paper has been to set new limits on extra - dimensional models and other physics beyond the standard model using casimir force measurements between a sphere and a plate separated by @xmath3261.2 @xmath0 m . these experimental results along with a detailed theoretical analysis lead to new constraints on yukawa modifications of newtonian gravity at short distances , and these are presented in fig .",
    "although the constraints on the yukawa parameter @xmath276 we obtain are @xmath327 , this does not imply that our experiment has to be improved by 13 orders of magnitude to detect newtonian gravity .",
    "rather , the exponential factor @xmath328 in eq.([eq26 ] ) strongly suppresses contributions from those parts of the sphere and plate separated by @xmath329 .",
    "this `` finite size effect '' @xcite , which is not relevant for gravity , has a consequence that a yukawa force between the sphere and plate with @xmath330 is much weaker than gravity .",
    "the actual gravitational force in our experiment is only @xmath331 orders of magnitude from being detected ( using the actual materials employed ) , a gap that may be closed within the forseeable future based on the rapid progress various groups have made in the last few years .    to carry out our objective ,",
    "an mto was used to obtain the first precise measurements of the casimir force between dissimilar metals cu and au . in the static regime ,",
    "the casimir force between a sphere and a plate was measured with an absolute error 0.3pn at a 95% confidence level .",
    "this translates into an experimental relative error of the casimir force measurements at the separation 188 nm of approximately 0.27% , i.e. , several times smaller than the most precise previous experiments carried out by means of an afm @xcite . to take advantage of the high quality factor of the mto , the casimir force derivative between the sphere and plate",
    "was then measured dynamically .",
    "this derivative was shown to be effectively equivalent to the pressure between two parallel plates composed of the same materials .",
    "this pressure was determined with a mean absolute error of 0.6mpa at the same confidence level , which leads to an experimental relative error of approximately 0.26% at the separation 260 nm .",
    "( this compares with a relative error of 15% quoted by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who directly measured the casimir pressure between parallel plates . )    as noted above , the precise calculation of the casimir force and pressure between real metals that is needed to extract the effects of new physics calls for the careful accounting of different corrections ( e.g. , due to surface roughness , finite conductivity of the boundary metals , nonzero temperature , and finite extent of the plate ) .",
    "the corrections due to roughness were computed on the basis of the afm images of the surfaces of the test bodies .",
    "finite conductivity corrections were calculated using tabulated data for the complex index of refraction .",
    "other corrections were also estimated ( including traditional thermal corrections ) and found to be negligible .",
    "the estimated theoretical uncertainty is at the level of 1% of the calculated force , i.e. , greater than the experimental uncertainty at the shortest separations used . within the limits of all errors ,",
    "theory is in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the level of agreement between theory and experiment was used to draw important conclusions concerning the influence of thermal effects on the casimir force predicted by quantum field theory at nonzero temperature .",
    "our experimental results lead to a resolution of the controversy over whether the thermal effects on the casimir force between real metals is close to that predicted by the matsubara formulation of quantum field theory for ideal metals , or is significantly different as claimed in refs .",
    "we have shown that the experimental results contradict the large , linear in temperature , thermal corrections predicted in refs .  @xcite . although the sensitivity of the current experiment is not yet sufficient to detect the small thermal corrections to the casimir force and pressure predicted for real metals in refs .",
    "@xcite , they are compatible with our experiment .",
    "the good agreement between theory and experiment was then used to set stronger constraints on hypothetical yukawa interactions predicted by extra - dimensional physics and extensions to the standard model .",
    "existing limits were strengthened by a factor of up to 11 within a wide interaction range , from 56 nm to 330 nm .",
    "this interaction range covers the gap between the modern results obtained from casimir force measurements using a torsion pendulum and an afm .",
    "the previously known constraints within this gap were based on old , and less reliable , casimir force measurements between dielectrics .",
    "our experimental arrangement suggests the need for additional work to further improve the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "we plan to use smoother and thicker metal coatings on the surfaces of the test bodies , yielding a better characterization of the roughness .",
    "this will permit us to carry out measurements at shorter separations , and to significantly strengthen the constraints on the predictions of extra - dimensional physics in a wider interaction range .",
    "the altimate goal of this program to use the iso - electronic effect @xcite to suppress the casimir force so as to improve our sensitivity to new forces beyond the standard model .",
