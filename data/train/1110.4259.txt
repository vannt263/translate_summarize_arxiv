    "it is well known that the standard model ( sm ) with single higgs boson is the simplest one and has been tested with great precision . despite its many successes it has some theoretical shortcomings which preclude to recognize the sm as a fundamental theory .",
    "for example the sm does nt addresses the following issues ( i ) hierarchy puzzle ( ii ) origin of mass spectrum ( iii ) why only three generations of quarks and leptons ?",
    "( iv ) neutrinos are massless but experiments have shown that the neutrinos have non - zero mass .",
    "the above mentioned issues indicate that there must be a new physics ( np ) beyond the sm .",
    "various extensions of the sm are motivated to understand some of the above mentioned problems .",
    "these extensions are two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) , universal extra dimension model ( ued ) and standard model with fourth generation ( sm4)etc .",
    "sm4 implying a fourth family of quarks and leptons seems to most economical in number of additional particles and simpler in the sense that it does not introduce any new operators .",
    "interest in sm4 was fairly high in the 1980s until the electroweak precision data seemed to rule it out .",
    "the other reason which increases the interest in the fourth generation was the measurement of the number of light neutrinos at the @xmath4 pole that showed only three light neutrinos could exist . however , the discovery of neutrino oscillations suggested the possibility of a mass scale beyond the sm , and the models with the sufficiently massive neutrino became acceptable @xcite . though the early study of the ew precision measurements ruled out a fourth generation @xcite , however it was subsequently pointed out @xcite that if the fourth generation masses are not degenerate , then the ew precision data do not prohibit the fourth generation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sm can be simply extended with a sequential as four quark and four lepton left handed doublets and corresponding right handed singlets .",
    "the possible sequential fourth generation may play an important role in understanding the well known problem of cp violation and flavor structure of standard theory @xcite , electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , hierarchies of fermion mass and mixing angle in quark / lepton sectors @xcite .",
    "a thorough discussion on the theoretical and experimental aspects of the fourth generation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is necessary to mention here that the sm4 particles are heavy in nature , consequently they are hard to produce in the accelerators .",
    "therefore , we have to go for some alternate scenarios where we can find their influence at low energies . in this regard ,",
    "the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions provide an ideal plateform to establish new physics ( np ) .",
    "this is because of the fact that fcnc transitions are not allowed at tree level in the sm and are allowed at loop level through gim mechanism which can get contributions of np from newly proposed particles via loop diagrams . among different fcnc transitions the one @xmath5 transition plays a pivotal role to perform efficient tests of np scenarios @xcite .",
    "it is also the fact that @xmath6 violation in @xmath7 transitions is predicted to be very small in the sm , thus , any experimental evidence for sizable @xmath6 violating effects in the @xmath8 system would clearly point towards a np scenario .",
    "the fcnc transitions in sm4 contains much fewer parameters and has a possibility of having simultaneously sizeable effects in @xmath9 and @xmath8 mesons system compared to other np models .",
    "the exploration of physics beyond the standard model through various inclusive @xmath8 meson decays like @xmath10 and their corresponding exclusive processes , @xmath11 with @xmath12 etc have been done in literature @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that the above mentioned inclusive and exclusive decays of @xmath8 meson are very sensitive to the flavor structure of the standard model and provide a windowpane for any np model .",
    "there are two different ways to incorporate the np effects in the rare decays , one through the modification in wilson coefficients and the other through new operators which are absent in the standard model .",
    "it is necessary to mention here the fcnc decay modes like @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 which are also useful in the determination of precise values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 wilson coefficients as well as the sign of @xmath19 in particular these decay modes involved observables which can distinguish between the various extensions of standard model .",
    "the observables like branching ratio , forward - backward asymmetry , lepton polarization asymmetries and helicity fractions of final state mesons for the semileptonic @xmath8 decays are greatly influenced under different scenarios beyond the standard model .",
    "therefore , the precise measurement of these observables will play an important role in the indirect searches of np including sm4 . in this work we study the physical observables such as branching ratio and helicity fractions when @xmath2 meson is longitudinally and transversely polarized for the decays @xmath0 in sm4 .",
    "the longitudinal helicity fraction @xmath20 has been measured for the @xmath2 meson by lhcb@xcite , cdf@xcite , belle @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations for the decay channel @xmath21 .",
    "the recent results are quite intriguing especially that from lhcb and cdf collaborations . in this respect",
    "it is appropriate to look for the above mentioned observables which can be tested experimentally to pin down the status of sm4 . in exclusive decays the main job is to calculate the form factors , for our analysis we borrow the light cone qcd sum rules form factors ( lcsr)@xcite .",
    "we organize the manuscript as follows : in sec .",
    "[ tf ] , we fill our toolbox with the theoretical framework needed to study the said process in the fourth - generation sm . in sec .",
    "[ pheno ] , we discuss the phenomenology of the polarized branching ratios and helicity fractions of @xmath2 meson in @xmath22 in detail .",
    "we give the numerical analysis of our observables and discuss the sensitivity of these observables with the np scenarios .",
    "we summarize the main points of our findings in sec .",
    "at quark level the decay @xmath23 @xmath24 is governed by the transition @xmath25 for which the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath26where @xmath27 @xmath28 are the four - quark operators and @xmath29 are the corresponding wilson  coefficients at the energy scale @xmath30 and the explicit expressions of these in the sm at nlo and nnlo are given in @xcite .",
    "the operators responsible for @xmath31 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 and their form is given by @xmath35with @xmath36 .    in terms of the above hamiltonian",

    "the operator @xmath34 can not be induced by the insertion of four - quark operators because of the absence of the @xmath4-boson in the effective theory .",
    "therefore , the wilson coefficient @xmath41 does not renormalize under qcd corrections and hence it is independent on the energy scale .",
    "in addition to this , the above quark level decay amplitude can receive contributions from the matrix element of four - quark operators , @xmath42 , which are usually absorbed into the effective wilson coefficient @xmath43 and can usually be called @xmath17 , that can be found in @xcite    the sequential fourth generation model with an additional up - type quark @xmath44 and down - type quark @xmath45 , a heavy charged lepton @xmath46 and an associated neutrino @xmath47 is a simple and non - supersymmetric extension of the sm , and as such does not add any new dynamics to the sm .",
    "being a simple extension of the sm it retains all the properties of the sm where the new top quark @xmath44 like the other up - type quarks , contributes to @xmath48 transition at the loop level .",
    "therefore , the effect of fourth generation displays itself by changing the values of wilson coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath41 via the virtual exchange of fourth generation up - type quark @xmath44 which then take the form ; @xmath51where @xmath52 and the explicit forms of the @xmath53 s can be obtained from the corresponding expressions of the wilson coefficients in the sm by substituting @xmath54 . by adding an extra family of quarks , the ckm matrix of the sm",
    "is extended by another row and column which now becomes @xmath55 .",

    ". then @xmath58 and from eq . (",
    "[ wilson - modified ] ) we have@xmath59one can clearly see that under @xmath60 or @xmath61 the term @xmath62 vanishes which is the requirement of gim mechanism .",
    "taking the contribution of the @xmath44 quark in the loop the wilson coefficients @xmath63 s can be written in the following form@xmath64where we factored out @xmath65 term in the effective hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ effective hamiltonian 1 ] ) and the last term in these expressions corresponds to the contribution of the @xmath66 quark to the wilson coefficients .",
    "@xmath67 can be parameterized as : @xmath68where @xmath69 is the new @xmath6 odd phase .",
    "the exclusive @xmath70 decay involves the hadronic matrix elements which can be obtained by sandwiching the quark level operators given in eq .",
    "( [ quark - amplitude ] ) between initial state @xmath71 meson and final state @xmath72 meson .",

    "the polarization of @xmath100 meson in the @xmath101 ( @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) decay is studied from the perspective of sm4 . in this respect",
    "the polarized branching ratios @xmath104 , @xmath105 and the helicity fractions @xmath106 of @xmath100 meson are studied .",
    "the explicit dependence of these observables on the @xmath107 and @xmath69 are also discussed .",
    "the study showed that the values of these observables are significantly affected by changing the value of sm4 parameters . as we discussed in the numerical analysis ,",
    "the polarized branching ratios are directly proportional to the sm4 parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 and inversely proportional to the ckm4 phase @xmath69 .",
    "it is found that at the maximum parametric space of sm4 the values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are enhanced up to 6 - 7 times of their sm values .",
    "similarly the influence of sm4 parameters on helicity fractions @xmath20 and @xmath110 and their average values are studied .",
    "it is shown that for the case of muons these observables do not show any significant change in their sm values . however , for the case of tauns the effects are quite prominent and well distinct from their sm values .",
    "it is also noticed that the effects of sm4 on helicity fractions are decreased when the value of @xmath40 is increased and almost vanishes at the maximum value of @xmath40 .",
    "it is also seen that the categorical influence of sm4 parameters @xmath107 and @xmath69 on @xmath111 are constructive and on @xmath112 are destructive .",
    "therefore , the precise measurement of the observables related to the polarization of @xmath100 meson , as discussed in this study , not only give us an opportunity to test the sm as well as useful to find out or put some constraint on the sm4 parameters such as @xmath107 and @xmath69 . to sum up ,",
