    "quantum entanglement @xcite is one of the most fundamental and intriguing features of composite quantum systems , whose potential for developing radically new forms of information transmission , processing and storage was only recently recognized @xcite .",
    "interest on the subject has therefore grown considerably in recent years , but many aspects of entanglement , particularly in mixed states of @xmath0-component systems , are still not fully understood .",
    "thermal entanglement @xcite refers normally to that of mixed states of the form @xmath3 $ ] , with @xmath4 the temperature and @xmath5 the system hamiltonian , which are for instance the natural initial states in nmr based quantum computing @xcite .",
    "a mixed state @xmath6 of a two component system @xmath7 is said to be entangled if it can not be written as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 density matrices for each component @xcite .",
    "if such an expansion is feasible , @xmath6 is termed separable or classically correlated , since it is a statistical mixture of product densities and the correlations between @xmath11 and @xmath12 are then amenable to a classical description .",
    "a separable pure state ( @xmath13 ) is always a product state @xmath14 , but this is not necessarily the case for mixed states , where it is in general difficult to prove separability .",
    "moreover , in contrast with pure states @xcite , there is no unambiguous computable measure of the entanglement of mixed states , except for two - qubit systems @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is known that any state of a @xmath15-dimensional system is separable if it is sufficiently close to the fully mixed state @xmath16 @xcite ( i.e. , if @xmath17^{-1}$ ] in bipartite systems @xcite ) .",
    "this ensures the existence of a _",
    "finite limit temperature _ for entanglement in any finite interacting system , above which @xmath18 becomes separable .",
    "the situation is more complex in @xmath0-component systems @xcite , where there are first many possible bipartite splittings ( bipartitions ) of the whole system to be considered .",
    "in addition , the separability of all bipartitions does not warrant the representation of @xmath6 as a convex combination of @xmath0-product densities @xmath19 ( full separability ) , nor of @xmath20-product ( @xmath21 ) densities ( @xmath20-separability ) @xcite .",
    "there are as well many @xmath20-component ( @xmath22 ) subsystems whose reduced densities may similarly possess different levels of entanglement . given the lack of simple global measures , many studies of interacting spin systems",
    "have then focused just on the entanglement of the reduced pair density , which , though physically very important , constitutes just a single aspect of the problem and leaves open the question about the entanglement of the system as a whole .",
    "the aim of this work is to study in more detail the thermal entanglement of @xmath0-qubit systems by considering all possible bipartite splittings of the whole system , as well as of selected subsystems , and evaluating the concomitant _ negativity _ @xcite .",
    "this quantity is a measure of the degree of violation of the peres criterion for separability @xcite , and satisfies in addition some fundamental properties @xcite which make it a suitable measure of bipartite entanglement in mixed states . as physical system we will consider @xmath0 spins interacting through @xmath23 type couplings with varying anisotropies , acting either between all spins or just between nearest neighbors in a one - dimensional cyclic chain @xcite , and embedded in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "these models are significant for solid - state based qubit representations @xcite ( the former is relevant for schemes based on quantum dots electron spins @xcite and josephson junction arrays @xcite ) , and many relevant studies of the two - qubit thermal entanglement in one - dimensional chains have been made @xcite .",
    "the picture that will here emerge is that of a hierarchy of negativities of global and reduced bipartitions which will possess different limit temperatures .",
    "the system will loose its quantum correlations as @xmath4 increases through a cascade of `` transitions '' that indicate the onset of separability of the different bipartitions , with reduced pair densities becoming separable before global partitions .",
    "the behavior of all negativities depends strongly on the interaction . in @xmath2 models , limit temperatures of global negativities",
    "are remarkably _ independent _ of the magnetic field , as will be demonstrated , even though the ground state may exhibit quantum phase transitions as the field is varied , while in anisotropic @xmath23 models they always increase as the field increases , even though ground state entanglement decreases .",
    "this behavior confirms that observed in two - qubit systems @xcite .",
    "comparison with the mean field critical temperature will also be made , and shows that symmetry - breaking mean field solutions are not necessarily indicators of entanglement for @xmath24 .",
    "we consider @xmath0 qubits or spins coupled through an @xmath23 type interaction in the presence of a uniform magnetic field along the @xmath25 axis .",
    "the hamiltonian is    [ h ] @xmath26    where @xmath27 are the spin operators , @xmath28 is the total spin @xmath25-component , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will consider two types of interaction range : i ) that where every spin interacts identically with all others ( @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) and ii ) that where only nearest - neighbors interact within a 1d cyclic chain ( @xmath36 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "both types become coincident for @xmath37 . regardless of the interaction range",
    ", @xmath5 always commutes with the @xmath25-parity or phase flip @xmath38 , and will commute as well with @xmath39 when @xmath40 @xmath33 @xmath41 ( @xmath2 models ) .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath5 is obviously independent of the sign of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( in i and ii ) .    for type i",
    ", @xmath5 is in addition invariant against any permutation of its qubits and can be rewritten in terms of the total spin components @xmath44 as @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "it commutes therefore with @xmath47 .",
    "its eigenvalues @xmath48 can then be obtained by diagonalizing @xmath5 in each representation with total spin @xmath49 , of dimension @xmath50 and multiplicity @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 .",
    "the eigenstates will be of the form @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , and @xmath57 a degeneracy index labelling different permutations .",
    "effective pseudospin hamiltonians of this form have been much employed in nuclear physics @xcite , and are also suitable for describing the effective interaction of josephson junction based charge qubits @xcite as well as of quantum dots electron spins coupled through microcavity modes @xcite .    for type ii , @xmath5 is translationally invariant , and for @xmath58 it can be rewritten exactly for each @xmath25-parity as a quadratic fermionic form @xcite .",
    "all @xmath59 eigenvalues of @xmath5 can then be obtained from the ensuing quasiparticle energies , determined through a fermionic bogoliubov transformation . for even @xmath0 ,",
    "the spectrum of @xmath5 is in this case also independent of the sign of @xmath60 , since it can be changed just by inverting the @xmath61 and @xmath62 directions at odd ( or even ) sites .",
    "we shall examine the entanglement of the corresponding @xmath0-qubit thermal mixed state @xmath63/{\\rm tr}\\exp[-h / t]\\,,\\label{1}\\ ] ] by considering _",
    "all _ possible bipartitions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 qubits and determining the associated _ negativities _ @xcite , defined as the absolute value of the sum of the _ negative _ eigenvalues of the ensuing partial transpose @xmath66 of @xmath6 : @xmath67 here @xmath68 , with @xmath69 @xmath70 labels for states of the first ( second ) component of the partition and @xmath71 . according to the peres criterion",
    "@xcite , if @xmath72 the two components of the partition are entangled .",
    "moreover , @xmath73 satisfies some fundamental properties of an entanglement measure @xcite : it does not increase under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , being then an entanglement monotone , and is a convex function of @xmath6 ( @xmath74 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) .",
    "it also provides an upper bound to the teleportation capacity and distillation rate @xcite . not all aspects of entanglement can be captured in this way , as peres criterion is in general sufficient only for two - qubit or qubit+qutrit systems ( although entangled states satisfying @xmath77 are bound entangled ) , and the separability of all bipartitions does not imply full separability @xcite .",
    "we shall not examine these features but rather focus on @xmath73 as an indicator of useful bipartite entanglement .",
    "in the same way we will examine the entanglement of reduced densities @xmath78 for @xmath22 selected qubits .",
    "it is apparent that for @xmath79 , entanglement in the state ( [ 1 ] ) can only be generated by the @xmath1 terms in ( [ h1 ] ) , i.e. , the sum in ( [ h2 ] ) , as @xmath80 is diagonal in the basis of separable eigenstates of @xmath39 ( standard basis ) .    for interactions of type i , the negativities of bipartitions with @xmath64 and @xmath65 qubits will depend just on @xmath0 and @xmath64 ,",
    "since @xmath6 is here completely symmetric under arbitrary permutations and any choice of the @xmath64 states is equivalent .",
    "there are thus @xmath81 $ ] negativities @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) that characterize the global bipartite entanglement ( i.e. , @xmath84 for @xmath37 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 )",
    ".    reduced densities @xmath88 for @xmath22 qubits in i will also depend just on @xmath20 , as any choice of the @xmath20 states is equivalent , and will be as well completely symmetric .",
    "we have then @xmath89 $ ] negativities @xmath90 of reduced bipartitions with @xmath20 and @xmath91 qubits .",
    "note that all negativities of reduced densities can be zero even if @xmath92 @xmath33 @xmath64 , as occurs for the well - known ghz type pure states ( @xmath93 , which lead to @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath22 @xmath33 @xmath64 . on the other hand , if @xmath96 @xmath97 , then @xmath95 @xmath33 @xmath64 and @xmath22 .",
    "actually , since tracing out a part of a local subsystem is a locc operation @xcite , we have the inequality @xmath98 for @xmath99 , @xmath100 , as the bipartition with @xmath101 and @xmath102 qubits of @xmath103 can be obtained by tracing out @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) qubits from the first ( second ) component of a global partition with @xmath64 and @xmath65 qubits .",
    "this implies @xmath106 if @xmath96 and hence the ordering of limit temperatures @xmath107 in the same system .",
    "for example , @xmath108 for @xmath109 .    for type ii , the negativities will depend as well on the spacings between the @xmath104 states of a subsystem .",
    "for instance , for @xmath87 ordered qubits @xmath110 we have three global negativities : @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , @xmath113 , corresponding to partitions with two adjacent and two non - adjacent qubits in each subsystem respectively .",
    "reduced densities for @xmath20 qubits will depend as well on the spacings between the @xmath20 states , and will not be necessarily cyclic , so that all possible partitions will have to be examined .",
    "for instance , for @xmath114 adjacent qubits @xmath115 in a cyclic chain of @xmath116 qubits , we have the adjacent @xmath117 and the non - adjacent @xmath118 reduced negativities .",
    "thus , for @xmath87 we have 3 global negativities , a single type of three - qubit reduced density @xmath119 with two negativities , and 2 two - qubit densities @xmath120 , @xmath121 for adjacent ( @xmath122 ) and non - adjacent ( @xmath123 ) qubits respectively , with negativities @xmath124 , @xmath125 . by similar arguments as above , for @xmath87",
    "we obtain the hierarchies @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "_ independence of limit temperatures from the magnetic field when @xmath131=0 $ ] .",
    "_ a remarkable feature of the thermal states ( [ 1 ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is that when @xmath132 @xmath133 ( @xmath2 models ) , the limit temperatures of _ global _ negativities are _ independent _ of the applied magnetic field @xmath42 , even though the negativities and the ground state entanglement are not , since in such a case the eigenstates of @xmath5 do not depend on @xmath42 and the field dependence of @xmath6 can be factorized .",
    "writing the states in the standard basis succinctly as @xmath134 , where @xmath20 ( @xmath135 ) denotes the @xmath25-component of spin in the first ( second ) subsystem of a bipartition ( remaining labels omitted ) , @xmath66 will have non - zero matrix elements just between states @xmath134 and @xmath136 , arising from those of @xmath6 between states @xmath137 and @xmath138 with the same total spin @xmath139 . the field dependence of these elements is contained in a factor @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the partition function .",
    "hence , we may write @xmath142\\rho^{t_p}(0)\\exp[-bs_z/2t]\\,,\\label{rtj}\\ ] ] with @xmath143 and @xmath144\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "while the field dependence of the eigenvalues of @xmath145 can not always be factorized , we obtain , as @xmath146 , @xmath147^{2^n}{\\rm det}\\,\\rho^{t_p}(0)\\,,\\ ] ] implying that the condition @xmath148=0 $ ] , which determines in particular the limit temperature for nonzero negativity ( i.e. , zero lowest eigenvalue ) is the same as that for @xmath149 .",
    "moreover , it is apparent from the strict positivity of @xmath150 for @xmath24 that @xmath145 is positive ( no negative eigenvalues ) if and only if @xmath151 is positive .",
    "a similar result for limit temperatures of negativities of reduced densities does not hold .",
    "this result has some interesting consequences .",
    "in particular , for @xmath131=0 $ ] the ground state will always become separable for sufficiently large fields ( i.e. , the state with all spins aligned @xmath152 , with @xmath153 ) , but the limit temperature will be the same for all fields , implying the reentry of entanglement for @xmath24 for such values if @xmath72 at low fields .",
    "it also implies that global limit temperatures will never coincide with the mean field critical temperature since the latter depends on the magnetic field ( see below ) .    _",
    "negativity for large fields when @xmath131\\neq 0$]_. another important feature is that for sufficiently large @xmath154 , the thermal density ( [ 1 ] ) will possess at least one nonzero negativity at any finite temperature @xmath155 . for sufficiently large fields",
    ", we may treat all interaction terms perturbatively . if @xmath156 , the thermal density will then approach that of the ground state @xmath157 , which will be the aligned state @xmath158 plus a small perturbation , as the weight of excited states become exponentially small ( of order @xmath159 or less ) .",

    "@xmath0 , as the latter either stay constant ( @xmath2 models ) or tend to increase ( full anisotropic models ) for increasing fields .",
    "note also from eq .",
    "( [ nk1 ] ) that for large fields ( @xmath203 ) , the negativity of symmetric global partitions @xmath204 in anisotropic models of type i remains non - zero for @xmath205 even if @xmath206 , and the same occurs in type ii models ( for @xmath207 ) , explaining thus the lack of agreement with @xmath202 .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath208 limit temperatures for global negativities will typically be of the same order as @xmath202 , as will be seen in the next section .",

    "thus , at the mean field level weak pair couplings in i have the same effect as much stronger values in ii .",

    "we observe the tail corresponding to the entanglement of the perturbed aligned state , while above the first transition the negativity undergoes an abrupt initial decrease as @xmath4 increases from 0 due to the almost degeneracy of the ground state .",

    "this is in marked contrast with the behavior of the mean field critical temperature , which vanishes for @xmath309 .",
    "limit temperatures are not , however , proportional to @xmath154 in this limit and ratios @xmath348 actually vanish for @xmath317 .    whereas in panels ( a ) and ( d ) limit temperatures of global negativities become close to @xmath202 for large @xmath298 , in ( b ) and particularly c ) they become substantially _ lower _ than @xmath202 , due to the quasi - degeneracy of the two lowest energy levels in this region .",
    "this indicates that symmetry - breaking is not necessarily an indication of entanglement at finite temperature .",
    "besides , limit temperatures _ are not necessarily smooth functions of _ @xmath298 , as occurs for instance in case ( b ) , where @xmath349 exhibits two slope discontinuities at @xmath350 and 1.83 , being minimum at the last value .",
    "these transitions reflect the changes in the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath66 , arising from level crossings , and become more noticeable in the limit temperatures of reduced negativities , as seen for @xmath233 and particularly @xmath234 , which exhibits a deep minimum at @xmath351 .",
    "the thermal behavior of the associated negativity in the vicinity of these crossovers can be more complex than in figs .  1 - 2 , and may exhibit a deep minimum followed by a maximum before vanishing , which may even evolve into a complete vanishing plus a reentry .",
    "results for type ii interaction ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) are quite similar .",
    "limit temperatures of global negativities and of reduced densities of adjacent qubits are higher than in i for the same value of @xmath191 , although they exhibit the same behavior and still fall well below @xmath202 in ( c ) . with the exception of case ( d ) , reduced pair densities of _ non - adjacent _ qubits ( i.e. , @xmath352 ( 2 ) and @xmath353 ( 3 ) ) have as well non - zero negativities at least for some field intervals ,",
    "although they possess low limit temperatures that depend strongly on the magnetic field even in ( a ) . for @xmath247 , qubits @xmath352 in ( a ) are entangled at @xmath260 just between the first and third transition ( @xmath354 ) while qubits @xmath353 just between the first and second transition ( @xmath355 ) , although for @xmath24 both become weakly entangled also for @xmath309 ( reentry effect ) .",
    "case b ) is more complex since it exhibits crossovers as in type i , reflected in the appearance of minima and slope discontinuities in the limit temperatures .",
    "the highest one @xmath356 has minima with slope discontinuities at @xmath357 and 1.99 , the latter being the absolute minimum . that of the reduced density of adjacent qubits displays actually a discontinuity at the minimum which is the signature of a _ reentry effect _",
    "( for @xmath358 , @xmath124 exhibits a small reentry as @xmath4 increases after its first zero , originating a discontinuity in the final limit temperature at @xmath359 ) .",

    "that of qubits @xmath123 becomes infinite for @xmath317 , like @xmath234 , but vanishes after the third @xmath260 transition ( @xmath362 ) , while that of @xmath360 is non - zero just for @xmath363 ( below the second @xmath260 transition ) . in c ) qubits @xmath123 become entangled @xmath33 @xmath364 , and their limit temperature , though lower , exhibits the same behavior as that of adjacent qubits , while qubits @xmath360 become entangled just for @xmath365 up to a very low temperature . finally , in d )",
    "non - adjacent pairs become separable , while the other limit temperatures become all higher than @xmath202 .",
    "in this work we have investigated the thermal entanglement of @xmath0-spin systems by evaluating the set of negativities associated with all possible bipartite splittings of the system and subsystems .",
    "entanglement is then seen to decay for increasing @xmath4 through a cascade of limit temperatures that determine the onset of separability of the different bipartitions . for the cases here considered ,",
    "the most persistent global negativity is that of the most symmetric bipartition ( @xmath366}$ ] ) in the fully connected case i , and the same occurs in the nearest neighbor case ii provided _ non - contiguous _ qubits are chosen in each partition .",
    "negativities of reduced densities and of weakly interacting splittings vanish obviously earlier , so that there is always some final interval where only _ global _ entanglement survives .",
    "the behavior with temperature and magnetic field of the most persistent negativity is rather similar in i and ii for the cases considered after adequate scaling of coupling strengths ( @xmath367 in i and @xmath368 in ii ) but depends strongly on the anisotropy .    in all @xmath2 models",
    ", we have shown that limit temperatures of global negativities are _ strictly independent _ of the ( uniform ) applied magnetic field @xmath42 , for _ any _ value of the total qubit number @xmath0 , even though the negativity may exhibit a stepwise variation with the field at @xmath260 .",
    "this implies in particular that one can not expect an agreement for all fields between these limit temperatures and the mean field critical temperature @xmath202 , even for _ large @xmath0 _ , as the latter always _ vanishes _ for sufficiently large fields .",
    "the lack of agreement persists in anisotropic models , where limit temperatures for global entanglement were shown to become large for large fields , even though the negativity tends to zero in this limit . in this case",
    "we have shown explicitly that for large fields ( @xmath309 ) and sufficiently low @xmath4 , negativities of most symmetric partitions remain finite even for large @xmath0 ( eqs .",
    "( [ nk1])-([nk2 ] ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath208 the negativity is normally seen to become relatively small above @xmath202 ( figs .  1 - 2 )",
    ", so that in this sense an approximate agreement with the mean field picture is recovered .",
    "negativities may also vanish for @xmath294 when ground state degeneracies ( exact or approximate ) are present , as seen in cases b and c in figs .",
    "5 - 6 . finally",
    ", it is to be remarked that limit temperatures may exhibit slope or full discontinuities for increasing fields for finite anisotropies , reflecting crossovers between different entanglement regimes , which may become more pronounced for those of reduced negativities .",
    "the present study provides therefore a more complete understanding of the way finite spin systems loose their quantum correlations due to standard ( i.e. , boltzmann like ) thermal randomness .",
