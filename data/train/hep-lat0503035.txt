    "this paper is the fourth of a series  @xcite on a research program aiming at developing and testing on the lattice the working hypothesis that confinement in qcd is produced by dual superconductivity of the vacuum , i.e. by condensation of magnetic charges .",
    "such a mechanism implies that the deconfining transition is an order  disorder phase transition , i.e. a true phase transition , described by an order parameter .",
    "another basic underlying idea is duality  @xcite : the magnetic excitations which are expected to condense are non local in terms of the fields .",
    "they should become local in the dual description , and the strong coupling regime of the confined phase should be mapped by duality in the weak coupling regime for dual fields .",
    "magnetic charges exist in gauge theories  @xcite and are nicely described in a formulation of the theory based on parallel transport , as the wilson formulation is  @xcite .",
    "the prototype theory is the lattice @xmath1 gauge theory in 4d . in the wilson s formulation",
    "this theory shows a deconfining transition at @xmath2 , from a strong coupling phase in which static charges are confined , to a coulomb phase .",
    "dual magnetic excitations can be defined and with them an order parameter which is the _ vev _ @xmath3 of a magnetically charged operator @xmath4 .",
    "this _ vev _ is different from zero in the confined phase , and strictly zero in the deconfined phase .",
    "this operator is defined by its correlation functions  @xcite , exactly like the kink s correlators in the ising model of ref .",
    "it can however be explicitly defined as a non local operator in terms of the gauge fields  @xcite in the same way as the kink creation operator can be explicitly written in terms of the spin variables  @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath4 is a gauge invariant dirac like  @xcite magnetic charged operator , non local but obeying cluster property , and a rigorous proof exists that it is the correct order parameter , both for the villain  @xcite and for the wilson  @xcite actions . in the presence of electric charges , however , there are problems for the existence of the duality transformation  @xcite .",
    "we will come back below in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] .",
    "the translation of the above formalism into non abelian gauge theories is non trivial .",
    "the original proposal to define and expose monopoles  @xcite is based on a procedure known as abelian projection .",
    "a gauge is fixed , e.g. by diagonalizing any observable in the adjoint representation , a residual @xmath5 gauge invariance is left and the monopoles are defined as monopoles of each of these @xmath1s , as for the abelian case . they show up as singularities of the gauge transformation which brings to the abelian projected gauge , in the sites in which two eigenvalues of the chosen observable coincide .    in this way",
    "the number and the location of monopoles in a given field configuration depends on the abelian projection , i.e. on the choice of the gauge , and there is a functional infinity of ways to do it .",
    "therefore if one pretends that the monopoles detected on the lattice configurations are the relevant degrees of freedom for confinement ( monopole dominance  @xcite ) , then one has to select the abelian projection which defines them .",
    "the usual choice is the so called maximum abelian projection , by which a gauge is selected maximizing the role of the residual abelian degrees of freedom . in some literature",
    "this choice is called the abelian projection _ tout - court_. according to this approach the monopoles in this projection are the effective degrees of freedom for confinement .    an alternative attitude is to look at the change of symmetries at the transition , postponing the identification of the relevant excitations , which is a far more difficult problem .",
    "this amounts to define and test an order parameter @xmath3 for monopole condensate .",
    "the lattice version of the operator @xmath4 has been constructed in  i ,  ii .",
    "@xmath6 creates a monopole in a given abelian projection at the site @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath4 is color gauge invariant , magnetic @xmath1 gauge invariant  @xcite , but of course is abelian projection dependent .    in  iii",
    "it was shown numerically that the order parameter @xmath3 is abelian projection independent .",
    "arguments were given in ref .",
    "@xcite justifying theoretically this observation .",
    "below we will present a complete argument showing that the statement @xmath8 or @xmath9 is abelian projection independent .",
    "any @xmath4 creates a monopole in all abelian projections .",
    "the recent observation of the existence of abelian abrikosov flux tubes even without fixing the gauge fully supports this view  @xcite .",
    "creating a monopole is a better defined operation than detecting it ; the same is true also for @xmath10 vortices  @xcite .",
    "their creation is gauge independent ; their detection depends on the choice of the gauge .",
    "in summary @xmath3 proves to be a good order parameter for the quenched theory : it is gauge invariant , abelian projection independent , strictly zero in the deconfined phase in the infinite volume limit  @xcite , non zero in the confined phase and its scaling with volume is consistent with the critical indexes of the transition .    on this basis @xmath3",
    "can be tentatively used as an order parameter for confinement also in full qcd .",
    "this would fill a gap : indeed in full qcd no @xmath11 symmetry exists , the chiral phase transition is defined at @xmath12 , but an order parameter for confinement is missing .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proved numerically that , for @xmath0 , @xmath8 below the `` transition line '' and @xmath9 above it . in this paper",
    "we discuss a finite size scaling analysis of the order parameter for @xmath0 qcd .",
    "we find that it is consistent with a first order phase transition .",
    "the same indication comes from the analysis of the specific heat and of the chiral order parameter at the chiral transition  @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] we review the status of the order parameter @xmath3 : its independence on the abelian projection , the difficulties related to the coexistence in the theory of electric and magnetic charges .    in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] we present the numerical results for @xmath0 qcd and a scling analysis of the order of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "[ sect4 ] contains the conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the operator @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) which creates a monopole of the species @xmath15 in a given abelian projection is defined in the continuum as  @xcite @xmath16 \\label{mua } \\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here    * @xmath17 is the vector potential produced by a dirac @xmath1 monopole sitting at @xmath18 in the transverse gauge : @xmath19 * @xmath20 transforms in the adjoint representation and has the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 the gauge transformation @xmath23 identifies the representation in which @xmath24 is diagonal , i.e. the abelian projection .",
    "of course @xmath13 depends on @xmath23 , i.e. on the abelian projection .    in the abelian projected gauge @xmath25 , which is @xmath26 independent , the longitudinal part of @xmath27 in eq .",
    "[ mua ] cancels in the convolution with @xmath28 , and only the diagonal part of @xmath27 contributes to the trace on color indexes . if we define the matrices @xmath29 ( @xmath14 ) as @xmath30 these matrices are a complete basis for traceless diagonal matrices .",
    "therefore @xmath31 and since @xmath32 in the abelian projected gauge @xmath33 \\nonumber \\ , .\\ ] ] @xmath34 is the conjugate momentum to @xmath35 , so that in the schrdinger representation @xmath36 @xmath13 creates a dirac monopole in the residual @xmath1 gauge field in the direction of @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand it can be proved  @xcite that the t  hooft tensor corresponding to a scalar field @xmath37 in the adjoint representation @xmath38 \\ } \\nonumber f_{\\mu\\nu } \\equiv { \\rm tr } \\left\\ { \\phi g_{\\mu\\nu } - \\frac{i}{g } \\phi \\left[d_\\mu\\phi , d_\\nu\\phi \\right ] \\right\\ } \\label{fmunu1}\\ ] ] reduces to an abelian form if and only if @xmath37 has the form @xmath20 of eq .",

    "only assumes the value @xmath47 , @xmath48 for @xmath46 any hermitian field @xmath49 in the adjoint representation can be put in the form @xmath50 ; meaning that an abelian projection is obtained by diagonalizing @xmath49 .",
    "monopoles will appear when the gauge transformation @xmath51 is singular , and this happens when @xmath52 , i.e. when two eigenvalues of @xmath49 coincide  @xcite .",
    "for generic @xmath53 any hermitian field @xmath49 in the adjoint representation can be written as @xmath54 with @xmath51 the gauge transformation which diagonalizes @xmath49 and orders the eigenvalues ( for instance in a decreasing order for their imaginary parts ) .",
    "@xmath51 will be singular at points",
    "where any of the coefficients @xmath55 is zero . in these points",
    "two eigenvalues of @xmath37 coincide . indeed from the definition of @xmath24 , in the abelian projected gauge @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the matrices @xmath58 play in @xmath53 the analogous role as @xmath59 in @xmath46 .",
    "one can define magnetic currents @xmath60 those currents are zero everywhere , because of bianchi identities , except at singular points where monopoles are located . in any case",
    "@xmath61 defining a magnetic @xmath1 symmetry , and conservation of magnetic charge . if this symmetry is realized _  la _ wigner , i.e. if the vacuum has definite magnetic charge , the system is normal .",
    "the vacuum is a magnetic superconductor if it does not have a definite magnetic charge , but is a superposition of states with different magnetic charges .",
    "@xmath62 can signal the second possibility . in the normal state @xmath63",
    "the lattice version of @xmath13 has been constructed in  i  and  ii , and is equally well defined in the presence of dynamical quarks .",
    "it was numerically shown in  iii that being @xmath63 or @xmath62 is a property independent of the choice of the abelian projection , and is shared by the version in which @xmath20 is put diagonal configuration by configuration , which is kind of an average on infinitely many abelian projections .",
    "the same thing results from comparison of measurements of @xmath64 in different abelian projections with measurement made by use of scrdinger functional  @xcite as in ref .",
    "more recently flux tubes were observed in @xmath46 gauge configurations in the @xmath65 direction without fixing the abelian projection  @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the density of monopoles is finite , i.e. if in whatever abelian projection there exists a finite number of them per unit volume , then the gauge transformation @xmath66 which connects two abelian projections is continuos everywhere except at a finite number of points , where monopoles are located .    creating a monopole with @xmath67 will add a singularity say in one of the abelian projections : the probability that @xmath26 coincides with the position of a monopole already present will be zero , and there will be a neighbourhood of @xmath26 in which @xmath68 is regular . adding a singularity in one of the abelian projections amounts to add a new singularity also in the others .",
    "@xmath13 creates a monopole in all abelian projections .",
    "therefore @xmath69 means higgs breaking of magnetic charge of type `` @xmath15 '' in all of them .",
    "dual superconductivity is an absolute property , independent of the abelian projection .",
    "the density of monopoles is known to be finite  @xcite . a direct test of that can be made by looking at the distribution of the difference between eigenvalues of any hermitian operator in the adjoint representation .",

    "@xcite about the difficulty to obey dirac condition for magnetic charges in the presence of electric charges .",
    "this is a general problem : in @xmath1 this difficulty shows up as the non existence of the duality transformation , and this produces problems at short distances : an operator like @xmath4 should be modified at distances @xmath73 by terms @xmath74 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest a modified formulation in which a coulombic magnetic field produced by a monopole is replaced by a superposition of radial flux tubes with quantized flux  @xcite .",
    "this is a big revision in the description of a monopole , but is in any case unmanageable from the numerical point of view  @xcite . in any case",
    "our operator is defined up to term @xmath74 as explained in i sect .",
    "ii , so that looking for @xmath74 corrections would be meaningless anyhow .",
    "contrary to @xmath1 @xmath74 corrections in qcd should become unimportant in the continuum limit because of asymptotic freedom .",
    "the problem is however open and deserves further investigation .",
    "the study of the qcd finite temperature transition for 2 flavors is of fundamental importance .",
    "the phase transition is well understood at high masses ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) , where the quarks decouple ; the transition is first order and the polyakov line is a good order parameter . at @xmath77 a chiral transition exists , where chiral symmetry is restored , and the chiral condensate @xmath78 is an order parameter .",
    "at some temperature also the axial @xmath79 is expected to be restored : indeed the topological susceptibility drops to zero around @xmath80  @xcite . in principle at @xmath77 there are 3 transitions ( chiral , axial @xmath79 , deconfinement ) : it is not clear if they coincide .",
    "an effective description of the chiral transition can be given in terms of an effective free energy  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the scalar and pseudoscalar modes are the relevant critical degrees of freedom , there is no infrared stable fixed points for @xmath81 and the transition is expected to be first order . for @xmath0 the transition is first order if the anomaly is negligible ( @xmath82 ) at @xmath80 ; it can be second order with symmetry @xmath83 if the anomaly survives the chiral transition . in the first case the transition surface around @xmath84",
    "is first order .",
    "if the chiral transition is instead second order the surface is a crossover , and a tricritical point is expected in the @xmath85 plane ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , detectable by heavy ion experiments .",
    "the first scenario is compatible with dual superconductivity of the vacuum being the mechanism for confinement both in pure gauge and in presence of dynamical quarks , independently of their mass : the deconfinement transition is then always an order - disorder phase transition , not a crossover .",
    "if the second is the case instead , the deconfining transition can not be order - disorder , there is no order parameter for confinement , and a state of a free quark can continuously be transfered below the `` deconfining temperature '' : confined and deconfined then lose a definite meaning .",
    "the question can be answered by a numerical study of the chiral phase transition and has been the subject of extensive , even if not conclusive , literature  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have presented a large scale finite size scaling analysis of the 2 flavor chiral transition by looking at the specific heat , the chiral susceptibilty and the equation of state : we have found clear disagreement with a second order @xmath83 behaviour and solid indications of the possible presence of a first order phase transition . on the other hand",
    "the fact that dual superconductivity is at work also in the presence of two dynamical flavours has been already shown , for finite quark masses ( @xmath86 ) , in ref .",
    "@xcite , using @xmath87 as a disorder parameter , and also in the schrdinger functional approach in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this section",
    "we present a finite size scaling analysis of @xmath88 around the chiral phase transition : if @xmath89 is the correct ( dis)order parameter for confinement , this analysis will give the correct critical indexes .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 is defined on the lattice as ( see i and ii ) @xmath91 @xmath92 is obtained from @xmath93 by changing the action in the time slice @xmath94 , @xmath95 . in the abelian projected gauge",
    "the plaquettes @xmath96 are changed by substituting @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the diagonal gauge group generator corresponding to the monopole species chosen .",
    "the numerical determination of @xmath90 is very difficult , since @xmath90 is expressed as the ratio of two partition functions . instead of",

    "the phase transition corresponds to a strong negative peak of @xmath101 .",
    "a negative value of @xmath101 diverging in the thermodynamical limit in the deconfined phase means @xmath103 being exactly zero on that side ( see i , ii , iii ) .",
    "we have made simulations with two degenerate flavors of kogut - susskind quarks , using the standard gauge and fermion actions .",
    "configuration updating was performed using the standard hybrid r algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the lattice temporal size was fixed at @xmath104 .",
    "different spatial sizes ( @xmath105 ) and values of the quark mass were used . for a more detailed account on simulation parameters we refer to  @xcite .     according to the critical indexes of first order transition.,height=219 ]     according to the @xmath83 critical indexes.,height=219 ]",
    "we can assume the following general scaling form for @xmath106 around the phase transition : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the reduced temperature and @xmath109 the quark mass .",
    "sending @xmath110 to infinity keeping @xmath111 or @xmath112 fixed , must be a convergent limit .",
    "analyticity arguments  @xcite suggest that in the infinite volume limit the mass dependence in the scaling function factorizes , so that @xmath113 does not depend on the mass .",
    "in fact , the dependence on @xmath114 must then cancel the dependence on the factor @xmath115 in front .",
    "we then obtain the following scaling law : @xmath116 the same as in the quenched case .    in figure 2",
    "we show the quality of scaling assuming @xmath117 , i.e. a first order phase transition : a good agreement is clearly visible .",
    "the deviations from scaling in the deconfined region are expected  @xcite and are related to the disorder parameter @xmath90 being exactly zero on that side .    for comparison",
    "we show in figure 3 the quality of scaling assuming the @xmath83 critical index @xmath118 .    the @xmath83 universality class is clearly excluded , while there is good agreement with a first order phase transition .",
    "this confirms results obtained through an analysis of the specific heat and of the chiral susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "qcd with @xmath0 is a specially interesting system to investigate confinement .",
    "the order of the chiral phase transition can indeed decide if the deconfining transition is a real transition , as required by a mechanism of confinement like dual superconductivity , or a trivial cross - over .",
    "more generally the very possibility of defining confined versus deconfined relies on the existence of an order parameter .",
    "this parameter exists for the quenched theory , where the transition is first order , but is not defined for full qcd . for full qcd",
    "only a chiral order parameter @xmath78 is defined , and only at low enough quark masses .",
    "we have shown that an order parameter @xmath3 can be defined , which , independently of the presence of quarks and of their masses , characterizes confinement and deconfinement .",

    "this is the main result of the present article .",
    "the same indication comes from the analysis of the specific heat  @xcite , which is independent of any prejudice on the mechanism of confinement",
