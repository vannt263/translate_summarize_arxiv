    "casimir energies and forces are geometry dependent . determining the geometry dependence is a challenge both experimentally as well as theoretically .",
    "computing the geometry dependence of casimir energies can be viewed as a special case of the more general problem of evaluating the effects of quantum fluctuations in a background field @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the space(-time ) dependence of the background field can then be used to model the casimir geometry .    a universal tool to deal with quantum fluctuations in background fields is given by the effective action @xmath1 $ ] which is the generating functional for 1pi correlation functions for @xmath2 . in the present work , we consider a fluctuating real scalar quantum field @xmath3 interacting with the background potential according to @xmath4 . for this system , the effective action can be evaluated from @xmath5&= &   -\\ln \\left ( \\int { \\cal d}\\phi\\ , \\rme^{-\\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\phi     ( -\\partial^2 +   m^2 + v)\\phi } \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\quad \\frac{1}{2}\\sum _ { \\lambda } \\,\\ ,   \\ln ( \\lambda^2 + m^2 ) .",

    "the integral over the gauian fluctuations boils down to a sum over the spectrum @xmath8 of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this spectrum consists of the eigenvalues of the fluctuation operator , @xmath9 the relation to casimir energies becomes most obvious by confining ourselves to time - independent potentials @xmath10 .",
    "then , the sum over the time - like component of the spectrum can be performed . in euclidean spacetime",
    ", we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the summation / integration over @xmath13 results in @xmath14\\equiv \\frac{\\gamma[v]}{l_t}=\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum \\omega,\\label{eq : eov}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denote the spatial ( @xmath13-independent ) part of the fluctuation spectrum . here , we have defined the casimir energy from the effective action by dividing out the extent @xmath16 of the euclidean time direction . the relation to a sum over `` ground - state energies '' @xmath17 now becomes obvious .",
    "the general strategy for computing @xmath18 $ ] seems straightforward : determine the spectrum of quantum fluctuations and sum over the spectrum .",
    "however , this recipe is plagued by a number of profound problems : first , an analytic determination of the spectrum is possible only in very rare , mainly separable , cases .",
    "second , a numerical determination of the spectrum is generally hopeless , since the spectrum can consist of discrete as well as continuous parts and is generically not bounded .",
    "third , the sum over the spectrum is generally divergent , and thus regularization is required ; particularly in numerical approaches , regularization can lead to severe stability problems . and finally , an unambiguous renormalization has to be performed , such that the physical parameters are uniquely fixed .    for a solution of these problems ,",
    "the technique of _ worldline numerics _ has been developed @xcite and has first been applied to casimir systems in @xcite .",
    "this technique is based on the string - inspired approach to quantum field theory @xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "the ( quantum mechanical ) problem of finding and summing the spectrum of an operator is mapped onto a feynman path integral over closed worldlines . for the present scalar case",
    ", the effective action then reads @xmath19= -\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{1/\\lambda^2}^\\infty\\frac{\\rmd t}{t}\\ , \\rme^{-m^2    t}\\ , { \\cal n }   \\int_{x(t)=x(0 ) } { \\cal d } x\\ ,   \\rme^{-\\int_0^{t } \\rmd\\tau      \\left ( \\frac{\\dot{x}^2}{4 } +      v(x(\\tau))\\right)}.\\label{eq : gamw}\\ ] ] now , the effective action , or , more specifically , the casimir energy , is obtained from an integral over an ensemble of closed worldlines in the given background @xmath0 .",
    "this seemingly formal representation can be interpreted in an intuitive manner : a worldline can be viewed as the spacetime trajectory of a quantum fluctuation .",
    "the auxiliary integration parameter @xmath20 is called the propertime and specifies a fictitious `` time '' which the fluctuating particle has at its disposal for traveling along the full trajectory .",
    "larger values of the propertime thus correspond to worldlines with a larger extent in spacetime ; hence , the propertime also corresponds to a smooth regulator scale , with , e.g. , short propertimes being related to small - distance uv fluctuations . with the uv cutoff scale @xmath21 . ]",
    "most importantly from a technical viewpoint , the problem of finding and summing over the spectrum is replaced by one single step , namely taking the path integral . moreover , for any given value of propertime @xmath20 this path integral is finite .",
    "possible uv divergencies can be analyzed with purely analytical means by studying the small-@xmath20 behavior of the propertime integral , and thus no numerical instabilities are introduced by the regularization procedure .",
    "the renormalization can be performed in the standard way , for instance , by analyzing the corresponding feynman diagrams with the same propertime regulator and by fixing the counterterms with the aid of renormalization conditions accordingly .",
    "further advanced methods which can deal with involved casimir configurations have been developed during the past years , each with its own respective merits .",
    "in particular , we would like to mention the semiclassical approximation @xcite , a functional - integral approach using boundary auxiliary fields @xcite , and the optical approximation @xcite .",
    "these methods are especially useful for analyzing particular geometries by purely or partly analytical means .",
    "of course , a purely analytical evaluation of the path integral again is only possible for very rare cases , but a numerical evaluation is straightforwardly possible with monte carlo techniques and can be realized with conceptually simple algorithms , as described in the next section .",
    "applications to casimir geometries will be presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : geom ] and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "with the aid of the normalization of the path integral @xcite , we note that ( [ eq : gamw ] ) can be written as @xmath19=-\\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^2 } \\int_{1/\\lambda^2}^\\infty \\frac{\\rmd t}{t^3}\\ , \\rme^{-m^2 t}\\,\\left ( \\left\\langle \\rme^{-\\int_0^t \\rmd      \\tau v(x(\\tau ) ) } \\right\\rangle_x -1\\right ) , \\label{eq : vev}\\ ] ] where the subtraction of @xmath22 ensures that @xmath23=0 $ ] .",
    "the expectation value in ( [ eq : vev ] ) has to be taken with respect to the worldline ensemble , @xmath24 in the present work , we focus on the `` ideal '' casimir effect induced by real scalar field fluctuations obeying dirichlet boundary conditions ; i.e. , the boundary conditions are satisfied at infinitely thin surfaces",
    ". this situation can be modeled by choosing @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the integration measure over the surface @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being a vector pointing onto the surface .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition is then strictly imposed by sending the coupling @xmath29 to infinity , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we are finally aiming at casimir forces between disconnected rigid surfaces , which can be derived from the casimir interaction energy , @xmath31-e[v_1]-e[v_2 ] , \\label{eq : ecas}\\ ] ] where we subtract the casimir energies of the single surfaces @xmath32 and @xmath33 from that of the combined configuration @xmath34 ; ) can be viewed as subtracting the casimir energy for the surfaces at infinite separation . ]",
    "the former do not contribute to the force .",
    "this definition , together with the dirichlet boundary condition , leads to @xmath35 \\right\\rangle_x , \\label{eq : ecasw}\\ ] ] where @xmath36=1 $ ] if a given worldline intersects both surfaces @xmath37 represented by the background potentials @xmath38 , and @xmath36=0 $ ] otherwise .",
    "this recipe has a simple interpretation : any worldline which intersects both surfaces corresponds to a quantum fluctuation that violates the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "its `` removal '' from the set of all fluctuations contributes `` one unit '' to the negative casimir interaction energy .",
    "the worldline numerical algorithm is based on an approximation of the path integral by a sum over a finite ensemble of @xmath39 number of paths , each of which is characterized by @xmath40 discrete points per loop ( ppl ) .",
    "these points are obtained by a discretization of the propertime parameter on each loop , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 . for an efficient generation of the worldline ensemble which obeys a gauian velocity distribution required for ( [ eq : vev2 ] ) , various algorithms are available , see @xcite .    in summary , worldline numerics offers a number of advantages : first , the whole algorithm is independent of the background ; no particular symmetry is required .",
    "second , the numerical cost scales only linearly with the parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "the numerically most expensive part of the calculation is a diagnostic routine that detects whether a given worldline intersects both surfaces or not , returning the value @xmath36=1 $ ] or @xmath44 , respectively . optimizing this diagnostic routine for a given geometry can lead to a significant reduction of numerical costs .",
    "details of this optimization for the geometries considered below will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the geometry of a sphere above a plate is the most relevant configuration as far as recent and current experiments are concerned @xcite .",
    "therefore , also worldline numerics has first been applied to this case @xcite . here",
    "we extend these studies , arriving at significantly improved results with much smaller error bars and for a wider range of parameters . in the following ,",
    "we exclusively discuss the massless case , @xmath45 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite which is the standard tool for estimating the effects of departure from planar geometry for casimir effects . in this approach",
    ", the curved surfaces are viewed as a superposition of infinitesimal parallel plates , and the interaction energy is then obtained by @xmath46 here , @xmath47 denotes a `` suitable '' auxiliary surface in between the casimir surfaces @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the corresponding surface element of @xmath47 .",
    "the distance @xmath51 between two points on @xmath48 and @xmath49 has to be measured along the normal to @xmath47 . obviously , the definition of @xmath52 is ambiguous , owing to possible different choices of @xmath47 .",
    "the two extreme cases are @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "the difference in @xmath52 for these two cases is considered to represent a rough error estimate of the pfa . in the above formula",
    ", @xmath55 denotes the classic parallel - plate result for the energy per unit area @xmath56 @xcite , @xmath57 with @xmath58 denoting the plate separations , and @xmath59 for an electromagnetic ( em ) field or a complex scalar , and @xmath60 for the present case of a real scalar field fluctuation .    for the configuration of a sphere above a plate",
    ", we can choose @xmath47 equal to the plate ( plate - based pfa ) , or equal to the sphere ( sphere - based pfa ) as the extreme cases .",
    "the corresponding results of the integral of ( [ eq : epfa ] ) can be given in closed form , see , e.g. , @xcite . in the limit of small distances @xmath58 compared to the sphere radius @xmath61 , @xmath62 , both pfa s agree , @xmath63 it is useful to display the resulting casimir energies normalized to this zeroth - order small - separation pfa limit as it is done in figure [ fig : sphereplate ] .",
    "the dashed and dot - dashed lines depict the plate - based and sphere - based pfa , respectively . for larger separations ,",
    "both cases predict a decrease of the casimir energy relative to the zeroth - order pfa in ( [ eq : enorm ] ) .",
    "our numerical worldline estimate confirms the zeroth - order pfa in the limit of small @xmath64 .",
    "but in contrast to the pfa curves , worldline numerics predicts a relative increase of the casimir energy in comparison with ( [ eq : enorm ] ) for larger separations / smaller spheres .",
    "we conclude that the pfa should not at all be trusted beyond the zeroth order : the first - order correction does not even have the correct sign . as a most conservative estimate , we observe that the pfa deviates from our result by at least 1% for @xmath65 , which confirms and strengthens the result of @xcite .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the validity bounds of the pfa will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the zeroth - order pfa ( [ eq : enorm ] ) still seems to be a reasonable estimate up to @xmath66 , indicating that the true curvature effects compensate for the higher - order pfa corrections .",
    "finally , we note that our results agree with the optical approximation @xcite for @xmath67 , confirming the absence of diffractive effects in this regime , which are neglected by the optical approximation . for even larger separations",
    "@xmath58 , we observe a monotonous increase of the casimir energy relative to ( [ eq : enorm ] ) . in this regime ,",
    "our results agree quantitatively with those obtained from the `` kkr '' multi - scattering map method presented by a. wirzba at this qfext05 workshop @xcite .",
    "most importantly , we do not observe a casimir - polder law for large @xmath64 , which would manifest itself in an @xmath68 decrease in figure [ fig : sphereplate ] at the large-@xmath69 side . since a casimir - polder law",
    "is expected for the electromagnetic case , our results for the dirichlet scalar provide clear evidence for the fact that the relation between casimir forces for the em field and for the dirichlet scalar is strongly geometry dependent .",
    "in fact , the latest results of ref.[14 ] include an analytic proof that the energy ratio of fig .",
    "[ fig : sphereplate ] approaches a constant , @xmath70 for large @xmath64 for the dirichlet scalar .",
    "the analysis of the sphere - plate configuration for the em field therefore still remains an open unsolved problem .",
    "note that this does not affect our conclusions about the pfa , since also the pfa does not treat the em case or the dirichlet scalar in a different manner .",
    "( 80,80 ) ( 0,0 )      a particularly inspiring geometry is given by a variant of the classic parallel - plate case : a semi - infinite plate perpendicular to an infinite plate , such that the edge of the semi - infinite plate has a minimal distance @xmath58 to the infinite plate , see figure [ fig : density ] ( left panel ) .",
    "whereas casimir s parallel - plate case has only one nontrivial direction ( the one normal to the plates ) , this perpendicular - plates case has two nontrivial directions but still only one dimensionful scale @xmath58 .",
    "this fixes the scale dependence of the energy per unit length unambiguously , @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the extent of the system along the remaining trivial transversal direction .",
    "the unknown coefficient @xmath73 results from the effect of quantum fluctuations in this geometry and will be determined by worldline numerics .",
    "let us first note that the pfa does not appear to be useful for the perpendicular - plates case , because the surfaces can not reasonably be subdivided into infinitesimal surface elements facing each other from plate to plate .",
    "for instance , choosing either of the plates as the integration surface in ( [ eq : epfa ] ) , the pfa would give a zero result .",
    "however , in the worldline picture , it is immediately clear that the interaction energy is nonzero , because there are many worldlines which intersect both plates , as sketched in figure [ fig : density ] ( left panel ) . as a direct evidence , we plot the negative effective action density @xmath74 ( effective lagrangian ) in figure [ fig : density ] ( right panel ) ;",
    "the effective action is obtained from @xmath75 .",
    "brighter areas denote a higher density of the center - of - masses of those worldlines which intersect both plates .",
    "( 160,75 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 70,0 )    integrating over the effective action density , we obtain the universal coefficient @xmath76 using @xmath77 worldlines with @xmath78 ppl generated by the _ v loop _ algorithm @xcite .",
    "we have presented new results for interaction casimir energies , giving rise to casimir forces between rigid bodies , induced by a fluctuating real scalar field that obeys dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we have used worldline numerics as a universal tool for dealing with quantum fluctuations in inhomogeneous backgrounds .    for the experimentally relevant sphere - plate configuration , we have performed extensive numerical studies , confirming earlier findings @xcite with a significantly higher precision and narrowing the validity bounds of the proximity force approximation even further . moreover , our results for small spheres for the dirichlet scalar shows no sign of a casimir - polder law , as it would be expected for the em field .",
    "this provides clear evidence for a different role of casimir curvature effects for these two different field theories , leaving the sphere - plate configuration with a fluctuating em field as a pressing open problem .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated a new geometry of two perpendicular plates which has been inaccessible so far for other approximation techniques .",
    "the configuration is representative for a whole new class of casimir systems involving sharp edges , where diffractive portions of the fluctuating field will play a major role .",
