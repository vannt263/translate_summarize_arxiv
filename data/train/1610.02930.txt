    "integrate - and - fire systems are hybrid systems such that , when a certain condition is satisfied ( the system reaches a certain threshold ) a reset occurs . such systems are widely used in neuroscience , as these resets represent neuron spikes . they can be seen as simplified versions of slow - fast systems , and the resets mimic large amplitude oscillations .",
    "examples of such systems range from simple one - dimensional models as the leaky integrate - and - fire , which models simple tonic spiking , to higher dimensional ones exhibiting more complicated behaviour .",
    "examples of the former are systems with variable threshold to model type iii excitability observed in the auditory brainstem  @xcite or systems with adaptation variables  @xcite .",
    "a general framework to study the dynamics of such systems becomes very difficult to obtain , mainly because they are discontinuous due to the reset condition , even when the input current are assumed to be constant ( they remain autonomous ) . in more realistic one considers periodic inputs instead . in this case , even one - dimensional integrate - and - fire systems exhibit very rich dynamics  @xcite .",
    "recent works show how theory for nonsmooth systems can be used to obtain model - independent general results  @xcite . however , these are limited to one - dimensional systems exhibiting simple subthreshold dynamics , as they are based on theory for circle maps ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .    in this work",

    "+ recalling condition _ h.2 _ , spikes are only possible for @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath75 , the stroboscopic map becomes @xmath76 then , the stroboscopic map restricted to @xmath77 becomes @xmath78 by considering @xmath79 and @xmath80 the extended versions ( to @xmath81 ) of the maps @xmath56 and @xmath70 and recalling that spikes occur for @xmath82 , if @xmath83 the stroboscopic map becomes the piecewise - smooth map @xmath84    if one allows the system to exhibit spikes for @xmath25 , then the stroboscopic map can be similarly defined by accordingly reordering in equation   the sequence of maps @xmath85 and @xmath64 .",
    "the stroboscopic map is discontinuous even if one identifies the threshold and the reset manifolds : @xmath86 .",
    "although this would make trajectories of the flow continuous , the field   does not necessary coincide at the manifolds @xmath8 and @xmath66 and hence the map would still be discontinuous .",

    "on one hand @xmath100 becomes the composition of two stroboscopic maps . provided that @xmath5 is a piecewise - constant function , its jacobian matrix of the stroboscopic map can be computed by solving the variational equations @xmath113{cc } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}f(\\varphi_a(t;z))&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}f(\\varphi_a(t;z))\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}g(\\varphi_a(t;z))&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}g(\\varphi_a(t;z))\\\\ \\end{array }   \\right)\\delta_a \\label{eq : variational}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 equation   must be integrated along the flow @xmath115 using the identity matrix as initial condition .",

    "i ) _ and _ ii ) _ of section  [ sec : strobo_def ] , we distinguish two different types of bifurcations :    1 .   tangent grazing bifurcation : the periodic orbit grazes tangentially @xmath8 , and the fixed point collides with @xmath109 , 2 .",
    "non - smooth grazing bifurcation : the periodic orbit grazes @xmath8 at the non - differentiable point given by @xmath67 , and the fixed points collides with @xmath136 .",
    "these two different situations may lead to different dynamics after the bifurcation .",
    "however , in this article we mainly focus in the second case , the non - smooth grazing case .",
