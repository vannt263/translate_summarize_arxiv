    "the extent to which the non - classical properties of one - mode field states survive in the presence of noise and losses was investigated since the early years of quantum optics @xcite . a routine operation like the transmission of light beams through an optical fiber could produce a substantial degradation of their non - classical properties . as an example , it was found that squeezing properties are altered by admixture with thermal noise and disappear completely for values of thermal mean photon occupancy exceeding the threshold @xmath0 @xcite . from a more recent quantum - information perspective",
    ", a lot of work is concentrated on correlations such as entanglement and discord in multi - partite systems @xcite .",
    "while correlations associated with entanglement @xcite are defined in connection to global transformations of bipartite quantum states , the concept of quantum discord arises from local ( marginal ) actions and measurements performed on one subsystem @xcite .",

    "we analyze the decay of quantum correlations of the field in a two - mode gaussian state due to the interaction of the modes with separate thermal baths .",
    "we focus on two measures of quantum correlations , namely , the entanglement of formation ( ef ) and the quantum discord , and evaluate them for a damped two - mode squeezed thermal state ( sts ) @xcite .",
    "our choice of this important particular class of gaussian states is motivated by the recent result @xcite that for an sts , the exact discord according to its original definition @xcite is achieved with an optimal measurement which is gaussian .",

    "<S> in this paper we examine the decay of quantum correlations for the radiation field in a two - mode squeezed thermal state in contact with local thermal reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> two measures of the evolving quantum correlations are compared : the entanglement of formation and the quantum discord . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytic expressions of the entanglement - death time in two special cases : when the reservoirs for each mode are identical , as well as when a single reservoir acts on the first mode only . in the latter configuration , we show that all the pure gaussian states lose their entanglement at the same time determined solely by the field - reservoir coupling . </S>",
    "<S> also investigated is the evolution of the gaussian quantum discord for the same choices of thermal baths . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the discord can increase in time above its initial value in a special situation , namely , when it is defined by local measurements on the attenuated mode and the input state is mixed . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement of discord is stronger for zero - temperature reservoirs and increases with the input degree of mixing . </S>"
