    "the ctio spectrum of this object ( fig .",

    "no other he lines are found in this spectrum .",
    "two emission features are found at 581 nm and 465 nm .",
    "they are probably due to the civ doublet ( 580/1 nm ) and the bowen blend of niii , ciii , and civ at 465 nm .",
    "similar features have been found in a few other cvs ( for a summary , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , usually indicating a very high mass transfer rate and a probably evolved secondary .",

    "all the blue hei lines are found in absorption , and only a faint emission is found for heii at 468.6 nm . we find no indication of hei in the red spectrum .",
    "the strongest emission in the blue is found at 465 nm and can be associated with the niii , ciii and civ emission in the bowen blend . from the properties of the emission lines , lb9963 would thus be characterized as a novalike variable with high mass transfer and accordingly optical thick accretion disc of high temperature .",
    "still , the absence or weakness of heii is puzzling .",
    "such a hot disc however , is supposed to have a strong blue continuum .",
    "the continuum of lb9963 , instead , shows a steep rise between 350 nm and 400 nm , which is not at all typical for a cataclysmic variable .",
    "we have examined our reduction process several times and can not find any indication of it artificially producing this unusual continuum .",
    "the spectrum has been taken at a high airmass of 1.9 but under parallactic angle to minimize the effect of differential refraction .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of @xcite shows a similar behavior .",
    "we thus believe this continuum to be real",
    ".    since we have only little information on the interstellar extinction , the cut towards the blue might be due to an exceptionally high interstellar reddening .",
    "although we can not rule out this possibility , we believe it rather unlikely as the galactic latitude of lb9963 is @xmath12 and the average extinction in this area of the sky is with @xmath13 rather low @xcite . however , a thin dust filament is distinguished in the iras maps of this region and might enhance the local extinction of lb9963 .",
    "the higher resolved dust maps of @xcite e.g. yield a reddening @xmath14 .",
    "this value is supported by the equivalent width of the nai absorption line .",
    "we find @xmath15 nm for nai ( d1 + d2 ) which converts to @xmath16 using the empirical relation discussed by @xcite .",
    "we used the equations of @xcite to deredden the spectra with either value .",
    "it does not improve the continuum shape significantly .",
    "in fact , a reddening as high as @xmath17 is needed to get a `` normal '' novalike continuum .",
    "assuming that the disc and the white dwarf do not contribute a lot to the continuum , alternatively , a late f - type secondary could explain the shape of the continuum .",
    "one would then expect to also see the absorption lines of this star , which would thus naturally explain the presence of the balmer absorption troughs without assuming a hot disc .",
    "however , this does not explain the he absorption , which is not present in f - type stars . also , the caii  line at 393.4 nm , which is typically a clear indication for an f  type star , is not present in the spectrum .",
    "we thus rank this possibility of an f - type secondary very low .    on the balance , we think that , however unlikely , a highly reddened novalike variable matches the spectrum better than a cv with f - type star secondary .      wy cma has been classified as a @xmath10 cepheid by @xcite who also gives the period of 1.14days and a photographic amplitude of 0.45@xmath18 .",
    "subsequently , the star appears in several catalogs and investigations , e.g. @xcite or @xcite .",
    "@xcite re - observed wy cma photographically and found that the resulting lightcurve does not agree with the classification as a cepheid and assume that the object is rather a long  period cv .",
    "thus , the object has been included in the cv catalogs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our spectrum shows the object to be an early f  type star , probably a giant .",
    "best matches of the absorption lines have been achieved with a f2iii template .",
    "the absence of any cv features in the spectrum make its designation as such untenable .",
    "further photometry , especially with a high - precision detector , might reopen the possibility of it being indeed a cepheid or allow its assignment to a different category of variable .",

    "are detected in emission .",
    "the spectrum resembles thus a typical dwarf nova spectrum in quiescence , although the inverse balmer decrement ( see tab .  [ line_tab ] ) points to a higher temperature or density of the accretion disc .",

    "the spectrum from march clearly confirms that fqmon was in outburst during this epoch .",
    "it is dominated by the very blue continuum and only faint emission peaks are present within absorption troughs . from the acquisition files",
    "we have estimated the brightness of fqmon by comparing it to the stars u082504435970 , u082504433933 , and u082504434176 from the usno - a2.0 catalog .",
    "we find @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for mar15 , apr30 , nov13 , and nov18 .",
    "we thus estimate the amplitude of the superoutburst to be of the order of 7mag .    the spectra also show that fqmon is a highly variable object .",
    "even the quiescence spectra are not alike but show variations of the continuum shape as well as of the strengths of the various emission lines ( see tab .",
    "[ line_tab ] ) .",
    "note that there is a slightly brighter star very close to fqmon .",
    "we can not completely rule out the possibility , that some contribution in the spectrum comes from this close companion and might produce an artificial variation .",
    "however , since the seeing always allowed us to separate the two stars and since we took special care to place the slit on fqmon itself , an additional contribution appears rather unlikely .",
    "the emission lines are clearly resolved and yield projected rotational velocities of about 1500km / s , thus indicating a high inclination system . still ,",
    "although broad , the lines show no double peak profile as should be expected for a high inclination dwarf nova . furthermore , even in the spectrum with the strongest emission lines , h@xmath7 is rather weak , even weaker than in the spectrum taken during outburst , and the balmer lines show a negative decrement .",
    "this is usually an indication for a magnetic system , so fqmon might thus belong to this category of cvs .",
    "since the superoutburst clearly classifies it as a suuma system , the magnetic field can only be of mediocre strength . in this respect fqmon",
    "might be comparable to gzcnc , a dwarf nova at the lower edge of the period gap , which is supposed to be a magnetic system and also shows an inverse balmer decrement , although less strong than is the case for fqmon @xcite .",
    "another similar system is vzpyx , also a suuma system which is at the same time a candidate intermediate polar .",
    "again , a slightly inverse balmer decrement is found in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "note that fqmon can be identified with the rosat source rxsj071641.6 - 065653 , which could also indicate a magnetic nature .",
    "fvcnc has been classified as a possible cv of ugem subtype by @xcite due to an @xmath25 intensity increase observed by hipparcos .",
    "the object was known as member of the open cluster praesepe on grounds of photometry and proper motion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "mermilliod et al . also found that fvcnc is a double  lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 2.981781(7 ) days and a circular orbit .",
    "they present the velocity curves of both components and derive a mass ratio of 1.06 .",
    "our spectrum shows the object to be a g - type star ; best match of the absorption lines has been achieved with a g0 - 4 template . due to the low resolution of our data , we can not resolve the double  line character .",
    "the classification is confirmed by the published photometric colors .",
    "mermilliod et al . measured (",
    "b - v ) = 0.69 and ( u - b ) = 0.19 , the colors of a g5v star , while ( b - v ) = 0.572 is given in the tycho catalog , which thus favors a slightly earlier type .",
    "the spectrum of fv cnc is thus inconsistent with a cv designation , and shows it to be a close binary consisting of two early g - type stars .",
    "the brightness variation observed by hipparcos remains to be explained .",
    "it could have its source in magnetic activity , or some external ( third - body ) cause .",
    "the object has first been noted as a variable by @xcite , who included it as a possible long period star in his catalog of ugem like stars .",
    "however , in the supplements to this catalog @xcite , he marks the variability as irregular .",
    "our spectrum is rather noisy but resembles a normal g - type star spectrum .",
    "a best match is achieved for a g5 - 8v template .",
    "hence , the variability is probably due to magnetic activity .",

    "@xcite have analyzed the outburst spectra and the lightcurve .",
    "they found the nova to be very fast with @xmath26 = 5 days and to show strong oscillations in the transition region .",
    "the spectra were dominated by strong emission lines with p cygni profiles yielding velocities of -1765 and -3010 km / s .",
    "the presence of feii emission lines puts the nova into the feii class of classical novae .",
    "our spectrum of v888cen taken nine years after outburst shows faint emission lines for h@xmath7 , h@xmath8 , h@xmath9 , as well as heii ( 469 nm ) and the bowen blend at 460 nm .",
    "the bluer balmer lines are rather found in absorption .",
    "this indicates a hot , optically thick accretion disc , typical for novalikes .",
    "since nine years is usually a sufficient time for a fast nova to cool down @xcite , we thus conclude that the binary v888cen is a high accretion rate system .",
    "we have discussed the spectroscopic classification for six candidate cvs . for two of them , lb9963 and fqmon , the cv classification could be confirmed , while the spectra of the others match those of normal main sequence or evolved stars .",
    "lb9963 shows the typical emission lines embedded in absorption troughs , and is thus believed to be a high mass transfer system . arguing against this interpretation is the lack of a blue continuum due to the disc .",
