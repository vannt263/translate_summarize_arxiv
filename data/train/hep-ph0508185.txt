    "unless specified otherwise , we shall assume that the mvbs have no appreciable couplings to sm fermions .",
    "secondly , if enough couplings and masses can be measured , these processes can provide a _",
    "test _ of the sum rules , probing the mechanism of partial unitarity restoration .",
    ".   indicates that the first mvb should appear below @xmath25 tev , and thus be accessible at the lhc . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the sum rules   imply an inequality ^(1 ) .",
    "this bound is quite stringent ( @xmath27 for @xmath28 gev ) .",
    "also , convergence of the sum rules   requires @xmath29 the combination of heavier masses and lower couplings means that the heavier mvbs may well be unobservable , so that only the @xmath30 states can be studied . the `` saturation limit '' , in which there is only a single set of mvbs whose couplings saturate the sum rules , is likely to provide a good approximation to the phenomenology of the realistic higgsless models . in this limit , the partial width of the @xmath26 is given by @xmath31 given the couplings of the mvbs to the sm @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we can now predict ( at the parton level ) the size of the new physics signals in the various channels of vector boson fusion . fig .",
    "[ fig : parton ] provides an illustration for the case of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we show the expected signal for either a sm higgs boson of mass @xmath34 gev , or the corresponding mvb @xmath30 of mass @xmath35 gev in the saturation limit",
    ". the sum rules ( [ sumz ] ) govern the signal in the @xmath32 channel shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : parton ] .",
    "however , the @xmath36 final state is difficult to observe over the sm backgrounds at the lhc : in the dilepton channel there is no resonance structure , while the jetty channels suffer from large qcd backgrounds .",
    "it is therefore rather challenging to test the sum rules ( [ sumz ] ) .",
    "notice that even if a @xmath36 resonance is observed , without a test of the sum rules ( [ sumz ] ) , its interpretation is unclear , since the sm higgs boson is _ also _ expected to appear as a @xmath36 resonance ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : parton ] ) .",
    "we shall therefore concentrate on the @xmath33 channel , in which the higgsless model predicts a series of resonances as in fig .",

    "conventional theories of ewsb by strong dynamics may also contain a resonance in this channel , but it is likely to be heavy ( @xmath38 tev for qcd - like theories ) and broad due to strong coupling . in contrast , the mvb resonance is very narrow , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : parton ] and eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) .",
    "in fact it is almost a factor of 20 narrower than a sm higgs boson of the same mass .",

    "[ fig : lhc ] . to estimate the prospects for the charged mvb search at the lhc",
    ", we require that both jets be observable ( we assume jet rapidity coverage of @xmath40 ) , and impose the following lower cuts on the jet rapidity , energy , and transverse momentum : @xmath41 gev , @xmath42 gev .",

    "the higgsless model can be easily identified by observing the mvb resonance : for the chosen parameters , the dataset contains @xmath50 @xmath51 events .",
    "the irreducible non - fusion sm background is effectively suppressed by the cuts : the entire dataset shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] contains only @xmath52 such events .",
    "we therefore estimate the discovery reach for @xmath26 resonance by requiring 10 signal events after cuts .",

    "we then find that with @xmath55 of data , corresponding to 1 year of running at low luminosity , the lhc will probe the higgsless models up to @xmath56 gev , while covering the whole preferred range up to @xmath57 tev requires @xmath58 .",
    "note , however , that one should expect a certain amount of reducible background with fake and/or non - isolated leptons .",
    "once the @xmath26 resonance is discovered , identifying it as part of a higgsless model requires testing the sum rules ( [ sumw ] ) by measuring its mass @xmath59 and coupling @xmath60 .",
    "the coupling can be determined from the total @xmath26 production cross section @xmath61 .",
    "however , we are observing the @xmath26 resonance in an exclusive channel , which only yields the product @xmath62 .",
    "a measurement of the total resonance width @xmath63 would remove the dependence on the unknown branching fraction @xmath64 .",
    "however , the accuracy of this measurement is severely limited by the poor missing energy resolution .",
    "even though a higgsless origin of the resonance can be ruled out if the value of @xmath60 , inferred with the assumption of @xmath65 , violates the bound ( [ bound ] ) , the lhc alone will not be able to settle the issue and precise measurements at the ilc appear to be necessary for the ultimate test of the theory .",
    "unlike traditional technicolor , higgsless models offer new discovery opportunities for a lepton collider with a center - of - mass energy in the sub - tev range .",
    "from we have seen that the masses of the new mvbs are expected to be below 1 tev , and they can be produced at the ilc through the analogous vector boson fusion process by bremsstrahlung of @xmath2 s and @xmath3 s off the initial state @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath30 production cross - sections for vector boson fusion @xmath68 and @xmath69 as well as associated production @xmath70 are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ilc ] .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond to the total cross - section of the continuum sm background .",
    "we see that for a large range of @xmath30 masses , ilc searches appear promising , already at the level of total number of events , before cuts and efficiencies . furthermore , because of the cleaner environment of the ilc , one can now use the dominant hadronic decay modes of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and easily reconstruct the invariant mass of the @xmath30 resonance , which provides an extra handle for background suppression ( see the right panel in fig .",

    "<S> we focus on tests of the mechanism of partial unitarity restoration in the longitudinal vector boson scattering , which do not depend on any higgsless model - building details . </S>",
    "<S> we study the lhc discovery reach for charged massive vector boson resonances and show that all of the preferred parameter space will be probed with @xmath0 of lhc data . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the prospects for experimental verification of the higgsless nature of the model at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in this talk we present new results relevant for the discovery potential of higgsless models at the international linear collider ( ilc ) . </S>"
