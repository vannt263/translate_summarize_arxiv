    "the solution of inverse problems provides a rich source of applications of the bayesian nonparametric methodology .",
    "it encompasses a broad range of applications from partial differential equations ( pdes )  @xcite , where there is a well - developed theory of classical , non - statistical , regularization  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the area of nonparametric bayesian statistical estimation and in particular the problem of posterior consistency has attracted a lot of interest in recent years ; see for instance  @xcite . despite this",
    ", the formulation of many of these pde inverse problems using the bayesian approach is in its infancy  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the development of a theory of bayesian posterior consistency , analogous to the theory for classical regularization , is under - developed with the primary contribution being the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "this recent paper provides a roadmap for what is to be expected regarding bayesian posterior consistency , but is limited in terms of applicability by the assumption of simultaneous diagonalizability of the three linear operators required to define bayesian inversion . our aim in this paper is to make a significant step in the theory of bayesian posterior consistency for linear inverse problems by developing a methodology which sidesteps the need for simultaneous diagonalizability .",
    "the central idea underlying the analysis is to work with precision operators rather than covariance operators , and thereby to enable use of powerful tools from pde theory to facilitate the analysis .",
    "let @xmath0 be a separable hilbert space , with norm @xmath1 and inner product @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be a known self - adjoint and positive - definite linear operator with bounded inverse .",
    "we consider the inverse problem to find @xmath4 from @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is a noisy observation of @xmath6 .",
    "we assume the model , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an additive noise .",
    "we will be particularly interested in the small noise limit where @xmath9 .",
    "a popular method in the deterministic approach to inverse problems is the generalized tikhonov - phillips regularization method in which @xmath4 is approximated by the minimizer of a regularized least squares functional : define the tikhonov - phillips functional @xmath10 where @xmath11 are bounded , possibly compact , self - adjoint positive - definite linear operators .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is called the regularization parameter , and in the classical non - probabilistic approach the general practice is to choose it as an appropriate function of the noise size @xmath13 , which shrinks to zero as @xmath9 , in order to recover the unknown parameter @xmath4  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a bayesian approach for the solution of problem ( [ eq : int1 ] ) , which will be linked to the minimization of @xmath14 via the posterior mean .",
    "we assume that the prior distribution is gaussian , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a self - adjoint , positive - definite , trace class , linear operator on @xmath0 .",
    "we also assume that the noise is gaussian , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a self - adjoint positive - definite , bounded , but not necessarily trace class , linear operator ; this allows us to include the case of white observational noise .",
    "we assume that the , generally unbounded , operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been maximally extended to self - adjoint positive - definite operators on appropriate domains .",
    "the unknown parameter and the noise are considered to be independent , thus the conditional distribution of the observation given the unknown parameter @xmath4 ( termed the likelihood ) is also gaussian with distribution @xmath22    define @xmath23 and let @xmath24 in finite dimensions the probability density of the posterior distribution , that is , the distribution of the unknown given the observation , with respect to the lebesgue measure is proportional to @xmath25 this suggests that , in the infinite - dimensional setting , the posterior is gaussian @xmath26 , where we can identify the posterior covariance and mean by the equations @xmath27 and @xmath28obtained by completing the square .",
    "we present a method of justifying these expressions in section [ sec : justification ] .",
    "we define @xmath29 and observe that the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath31 and @xmath32 is only through @xmath12 . since @xmath33 the posterior mean also depends only on @xmath12 : @xmath34 .",
    "this is not the case for the posterior covariance @xmath35 , since it depends on @xmath31 and @xmath32 separately : @xmath36 . in the following ,",
    "we suppress the dependence of the posterior covariance on @xmath12 and @xmath31 and we denote it by @xmath35 .",
    "observe that the posterior mean is the minimizer of the functional @xmath37 , hence also of @xmath38 that is , the posterior mean is the tikhonov - phillips regularized approximate solution of problem ( [ eq : int1 ] ) , for the functional @xmath14 with @xmath39 .    in  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "formulae for the posterior covariance and mean are identified in the infinite - dimensional setting , which avoid using any of the inverses of the prior , posterior or noise covariance operators .",
    "they obtain @xmath40and @xmath41 which are consistent with formulae ( [ eq : int4 ] ) and ( [ eq : int7 ] ) for the finite - dimensional case . in  @xcite this",
    "is done only for @xmath19 of trace class while in  @xcite the case of white observational noise was included .",
    "we will work in an infinite - dimensional setting where the formulae ( [ eq : int4 ] ) , ( [ eq : int7 ] ) for the posterior covariance and mean can be justified .",
    "working with the unbounded operator @xmath30 opens the possibility of using tools of analysis , and also numerical analysis , familiar from the theory of partial differential equations .    in our analysis",
    "we always assume that @xmath20 is regularizing , that is , we assume that @xmath20 dominates @xmath30 in the sense that it induces stronger norms than @xmath42 this is a reasonable assumption since otherwise we would have @xmath43 ( here @xmath44 is used loosely to indicate two operators which induce equivalent norms ; we will make this notion precise in due course ) .",
    "this would imply that the posterior mean is @xmath45 , meaning that we attempt to invert the data by applying the , generally discontinuous , operator @xmath46  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.7 ) .",
    "we study the consistency of the posterior @xmath47 in the frequentist setting . to this end",
    ", we consider data @xmath48 which is a realization of @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a fixed element of @xmath0 ; that is , we consider observations which are perturbations of the image of a fixed true solution @xmath50 by an additive noise @xmath51 , scaled by @xmath52 . since the posterior depends through its mean on the data and also through its covariance operator on the scaling of the noise and the prior , this choice of data model gives as posterior distribution the gaussian measure @xmath53 , where @xmath35 is given by ( [ eq : int4 ] ) and @xmath54 we study the behavior of the posterior @xmath55 as the noise disappears ( @xmath9 ) .",

    ", we aim to determine @xmath56 such that @xmath57 where the expectation is with respect to the random variable @xmath58 distributed according to the data likelihood @xmath59 .    as in the deterministic theory of inverse problems , in order to get convergence in the small noise limit , we let the regularization disappear in a carefully chosen way , that is , we will choose @xmath60 such that @xmath61 as @xmath9 . the assumption that @xmath20 dominates @xmath30",
    ", shows that @xmath30 is a singularly perturbed unbounded ( usually differential ) operator , with an inverse which blows - up in the limit @xmath61 .",
    "this together with equation ( [ eq : int7 ] ) , opens up the possibility of using the analysis of such singular limits to study posterior contraction : on the one hand , as @xmath61 , @xmath62 becomes unbounded ; on the other hand , as @xmath9 , we have more accurate data , suggesting that for the appropriate choice of @xmath60 we can get @xmath63 . in particular , we will choose @xmath32 as a function of the scaling of the noise , @xmath64 under the restriction that the induced choice of @xmath65 , is such that @xmath61 as @xmath9 .",
    "the last choice will be made in a way which optimizes the rate of posterior contraction @xmath56 , defined in ( [ eq : main1 ] ) . in general",
    "there are three possible asymptotic behaviors of the scaling of the prior @xmath66 as @xmath9 ,  @xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath67 ; we increase the prior spread , if we know that draws from the prior are more regular than @xmath50 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath66 fixed ; draws from the prior have the same regularity as @xmath50 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath68 at a rate slower than @xmath69 ; we shrink the prior spread , when we know that draws from the prior are less regular than @xmath70    the problem of posterior contraction in this context is also investigated in  @xcite and  @xcite . in  @xcite , sharp convergence rates",
    "are obtained in the case where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are simultaneously diagonalizable , with eigenvalues decaying algebraically , and in particular @xmath73 , that is , the data are polluted by white noise . in this paper",
    "we relax the assumptions on the relations between the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 , by assuming that appropriate powers of them induce comparable norms ( see section [ sec : assumptions ] ) . in  @xcite",
    ", the non - diagonal case is also examined ; the three operators involved are related through domain inclusion assumptions .",
    "the assumptions made in  @xcite can be quite restrictive in practice ; our assumptions include settings not covered in  @xcite , and in particular the case of white observational noise .      in the following section we present our main results which concern the identification of the posterior ( theorem [ justth ] ) and the posterior contraction ( theorems [ pdecor1 ] and [ pdecor2 ] ) . in section [ sec : assumptions ] we present our assumptions and their implications .",
    "the proofs of the main results are built in a series of intermediate results contained in sections [ sec : prmean]-[sec : main ] . in section [ sec : prmean ] , we reformulate equation ( [ eq : int7 ] ) as a weak equation in an infinite - dimensional space . in section [ sec :",

    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] is a short conclusion .",
    "the entire paper rests on a rich set of connections between the theory of stochastic processes and various aspects of the theory of linear partial differential equations .",
    "in particular , since the green s function of the precision operator of a gaussian measure corresponds to its covariance function , our formulation and analysis of the inverse problem via precision operators is very natural . furthermore , estimates on the inverse of singular limits of these precisions , which have direct implications for localization of the green s functions , play a key role in the analysis of posterior consistency .",
    "in this section we present our main results . we postpone the rigorous presentation of our assumptions to the next section and the proofs and technical lemmas",
    "are presented together with intermediate results of independent interest in sections [ sec : prmean ] - [ sec : main ] . recall that we assume a gaussian prior @xmath74 and a gaussian noise distribution @xmath75 .",
    "our first assumption concerns the decay of the eigenvalues of the prior covariance operator and enables us to quantify the regularity of draws from the prior .",
    "this is encoded in the parameter @xmath76 ; smaller @xmath77 implies more regular draws from the prior .",
    "we also assume that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , for some @xmath80 , where @xmath44 is s used in the manner outlined in section [ sec : intro ] , and defined in detail in section [ sec : assumptions ] .",
    "finally , we assume that the problem is sufficiently ill - posed with respect to the prior .",
    "this is quantified by the parameter @xmath81",
    "which we assume to be larger than @xmath82 ; for a fixed prior , the larger @xmath83 is , the more ill - posed the problem .",
    "our first main theorem identifies the posterior measure as gaussian and justifies formulae [ eq : int4 ] and [ eq : int7 ] .",
    "this reformulation of the posterior in terms of the precision operator is key to our method of analysis of posterior consistency and opens the route to using methods from the study of partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "these methods will also be useful for the development of numerical methods for the inverse problem .",

    "we now present our results concerning frequentist posterior consistency of the bayesian solution to the inverse problem .",

    "the rates we obtain are not as strong as in the simultaneously diagonalizable case when the true solution is too regular ; in particular our rates saturate earlier as a function of increasing regularity , and we require a certain degree of regularity of the true solution in order to secure convergence . it is not known if our results can be improved but it would be interesting to try . both of the two discrepancies are attributed to the fact that our method relies on interpolating between rates in a strong and a weak norm of the error @xmath114 ; on the one hand the rate of the error in the weak norm saturates earlier , and on the other hand the error in the strong norm requires additional regularity in order to converge ( cf . section [ sec : diag ] ) .",

    ". finally we briefly overview the way in which the hilbert scale defined in terms of the prior covariance operator @xmath17 , which is natural for our analysis , links to scales of spaces defined independently of any prior model .",
    "we start by defining the hilbert scale which we will use in our analysis .",
    "recall that @xmath0 is an infinite - dimensional separable hilbert space and @xmath117 is a self - adjoint , positive - definite , trace class , linear operator . since @xmath118 is injective and self - adjoint we have that @xmath119 .",
    "this means that @xmath120 is a densely defined , unbounded , symmetric , positive - definite , linear operator in @xmath0 .",
    "hence it can be extended to a self - adjoint operator with domain @xmath121 ; this is the friedrichs extension  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can define the hilbert scale @xmath122 , with @xmath123  @xcite , where@xmath124 the bounded linear operator @xmath125 is assumed to be self - adjoint , positive - definite ( but not necessarily trace class ) ; thus @xmath126 can be extended in the same way to a self - adjoint operator with domain @xmath127 finally , recall that we assume that @xmath128 is a self - adjoint and positive - definite , linear operator with bounded inverse , @xmath129 .",
    "we assume that we have a probability space @xmath130 .",
    "the expected value is denoted by @xmath131 and @xmath132 means that the law of the random variable @xmath51 is the measure @xmath133 .",
    "let @xmath134 and @xmath135 be the prior and noise distributions respectively .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath136 denote the measure constructed by taking @xmath4 and @xmath137 as independent gaussian random variables @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively : @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "we denote by @xmath142 the measure constructed by taking @xmath4 and @xmath5 as independent gaussian random variables @xmath138 and @xmath143 respectively : @xmath144    let @xmath145 be orthonormal eigenpairs of @xmath17 in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath146 are the singular values and @xmath147 an orthonormal eigenbasis . since @xmath17 is trace class we have that @xmath148 .",
    "in fact we require a slightly stronger assumption see assumption [ a2]([a1 ] ) below .",
    "we are now ready to present our assumptions .",
    "the first assumption enables us to quantify the regularity of draws from the prior whereas the rest of the assumptions regard interrelations between the three operators @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath72 ; these assumptions reflect the idea that @xmath149 for some @xmath150 , where @xmath44 is used in the same manner as in section [ sec : intro ] .",

    "in fact the assumption @xmath167 connects the ill - posedness of the problem to the regularity of the prior .",

    "the reason is that our analysis to obtain the error in the @xmath0-norm is based on interpolating between the error in the @xmath279-norm and the error in the @xmath242-norm . when @xmath542 interpolation is not possible since the @xmath0-norm is now weaker than the @xmath279-norm",

    "note , that the case @xmath543 does not necessarily correspond to the well posed case : by lemma [ l2 ] we can only guarantee that a draw from the noise distribution lives in @xmath544 , while the range of @xmath72 is formally @xmath545 .",
    "hence , in order to have a well posed problem we need @xmath546 , or equivalently @xmath547 . this can happen despite our assumption @xmath167 , when @xmath548 and for appropriate choice of @xmath248 and @xmath247 . in this case , regularization is unnecessary .",

    "the discrepancies can be explained by the fact that in proposition [ pdelem1 ] , the choice of @xmath451 which determines both the minimum requirement on the regularity of @xmath50 and the saturation point , is the same for both of the operator norm bounds .",
    "this means that on the one hand to get convergence of the term @xmath761 in equation ( [ eq : main6 ] ) in the proof of theorem [ pdeth2 ] , we require conditions which secure the convergence in the stronger @xmath242-norm and on the other hand the saturation rate for this term is the same as the saturation rate in the weaker @xmath279-norm .",

    "our methodology assumed a relation between the prior covariance , the noise covariance and the forward operator , expressed in the form of norm equivalence relations ( assumptions [ a2 ] ) .",
    "we considered gaussian noise which can be white . in order for our methods to work we required a certain degree of ill - posedness compared to the regularity of the prior ( assumption [ a2]([a2delta ] ) ) and for the convergence rates to be valid a certain degree of regularity of the true solution . in the case where the three involved operators are all diagonalizable in the same eigenbasis , when the problem is sufficiently ill - posed with respect to the prior , and for a range of values of @xmath92 , the parameter expressing the regularity of the true solution , our rates agree ( up to @xmath96 arbitrarily small ) with the sharp ( minimax ) convergence rates obtained in  @xcite ( section [ sec : diag ] ) .",
    "our optimized rates rely on rescaling the prior depending on the size of the noise , achieved by choosing the scaling parameter @xmath66 in the prior covariance as an appropriate function of the parameter @xmath13 multiplying the noise .",
