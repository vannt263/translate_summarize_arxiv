    "over the last few years we have witnessed a very rapid development of cooling and trapping techniques both for neutral atoms and for ions @xcite .",
    "these progresses have made it possible to perform sophisticated experiments wherein several examples of couplings between a few bosonic and fermionic dynamical variables have been realised @xcite . if , in fact , an ion confined in a miniaturised paul trap is exposed to suitably configured laser beams , the 3d harmonic motion of the ionic center of mass gets entangled with the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "some peculiar aspects of the vibronic response stemming from such a dissipation - free situation have been successfully exploited for realizing experimentally fock states , coherent states , squeeezed states and schrdinger cat - like states @xcite , presenting theoretical schemes for engineering several nonclassical state @xcite , implementing quantum logic gates @xcite , realising tomographic reconstructions of the density matrix of the system @xcite , and , more in general , discovering quantum effects characterising the ionic quantized oscillatory motion @xcite .",
    "many hamiltonian models have been reported so far in the literature to describe physical properties of trapped ions .",
    "some models explore physical situations wherein only the ionic motion along a specified direction of the trap is effectively influenced by the presence of the laser beams .",
    "when the induced vibronic coupling is instead extended over two ( three ) independent directions of the trap , then one refers to the correspondent physical scenario as to a 2d ( 3d ) trapped ion .    in this paper",
    "we study the motion of an ion isotropically confined in the radial plane of a paul microtrap when it is irradiated by a properly chosen configuration of external laser beams .",
    "we show that there exist experimentally interesting conditions under which the dynamics of this system may be exactly treated @xcite . exploiting this fact we find that the center of mass vibrational motion and the electronic degrees of freedom of the ion becomes entangled , in a way which is very sensitive to the parity of the initial number of vibrational quanta",
    ". then we study the robustness of this quantum effect with respect to various experimental imperfections .",
    "in fact , even if dissipation of the vibrational motion is completely negligible , non - dissipative sources of decoherence associated with fluctuations of external parameters may be important .",
    "we study these effects , and those of laser intensity fluctuations in particular , using the model - independent formalism of ref .",
    "we find that , using standard values for the strength of the laser intensity fluctuations , the parity - dependent entanglement effect is not washed out by non - dissipative decoherence . the effect of an imperfect initial state preparation of the vibrational degree of freedom is also studied .",
    "consider a two - level ion of mass @xmath0 confined in a bidimensional isotropic harmonic potential characterised by the trap frequency @xmath1 .",
    "let s denote by @xmath2 the energy separation between the ionic excited state @xmath3 and its ground state @xmath4 and assume @xmath5 .",

    "we assume that the ion is driven by two @xmath12-out of phase laser beams , applied along the two orthogonal directions @xmath13 and @xmath14 with an angle of @xmath15 relative to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 axis respectively .",

    "such a system is similar to the one currently used in the experiments performed at nist @xcite . the weak transition @xmath41 is simultaneously driven by two raman laser configurations with different detunings ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) from the electronic level @xmath44 and with frequency differences @xmath45 . for sufficiently large detunings , such that the intermediate state @xmath44 can be adiabatically eliminated ,",
    "only the electronic levels @xmath46 and @xmath4 are involved in the dynamics . in this case",
    "the two - photon raman transitions between the states of interest are formally equivalent to narrow single photon transitions @xcite .",
    "the raman laser fields are chosen to have wave vector differences @xmath47 and @xmath48 pointing in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions respectively . under these conditions , in the resolved sideband regime and in the lamb - dicke limit , the dynamics of the system is described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) provided that we make the following substitution @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the dependence of the lamb - dicke parameter on the modulus of the wave vector difference allows to vary @xmath52 by changing the raman beams configurations . in this way it is possible to obtain very small values of the lamb - dicke parameter as required in our scheme .",
    "for the scope of the paper it is important to underline that measurements of the electronic states are experimentally realizable with very high efficiency by means of the so called quantum jumps tecnhique @xcite .",
    "the method essentially consists in coupling the ground electronic level @xmath53 to a third auxiliary level @xmath54 by means of another laser beam . the transition @xmath55 is chosen to be a dipole allowed one . in this conditions ,",
    "the presence of fluorescence detects the ion in the electronic ground level and its absence in the excited level . with this method state detection efficiency",
    "approaches @xmath56 , even if a modest number of scattered photons are detected .",
    "let s denote with @xmath57 the product of the vibrational fock states along the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions and suppose that the initial state of the ion has the form @xmath58 the vibrational state @xmath59 belongs to the class of the so called su(2 ) coherent states defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the states @xmath62 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ su2 ] ) are eigenstates of the operator @xmath63 all pertaining to the eigenvalue @xmath64 representing the initial total number of vibrational quanta . in particular , as pointed out by gou and knight @xcite , the su(2 ) coherent state corresponding to the specific value @xmath65 , @xmath66 of a bidimensionally confined ion , coincides with the vibrational fock state with @xmath64 quanta along the direction @xmath13 forming an angle @xmath15 relative to the @xmath10 axis . since number states for the 1d motion of an ion in a rf - trap have been already experimentally realized ( see @xcite ) , it is evident that the initial state of eq .",

    "this implies that @xmath89 reaches its absolute minimum , indicating that the internal and external degrees of freedom manifest a marked tendency to disentangle each other . on the contrary , if @xmath90 is even , at the time instant @xmath91 , one has @xmath92 and therefore the vibrational entropy @xmath93 reaches its maximum value .",
    "this means that the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom are , at this time instant , maximally entangled .",

    "( [ entr2 ] ) . in both figures ,",
    "the cases of an initial total vibrational number @xmath78 ( a ) and @xmath79 ( b ) have been considered .",
    "these figures illustrate in particular the existence of a @xmath80-dependent time instant at which the system under scrutiny exhibits different quantum behaviours dependent on the parity of @xmath80 .",
    "the interesting physical aspect is given by the peculiar nonclassical sensitivity to the granularity of the initial total number of vibrational quanta @xmath80 .",
    "the physical origin of this intrinsically quantum behaviour stems from the specific two - boson coupling mechanism envisaged in this paper . in the rest of the paper we shall analyse the robustness of this quantum behaviour with respect to various experimental imperfections as the fluctuations of the intensity of the coupling lasers and a non - ideal initial state preparation     for @xmath78 ( a ) and @xmath79 ( b ) respectively.,width=302 ]     for @xmath78 ( a ) and @xmath79 ( b ) respectively.,width=302 ]",
    "in the previous section we have assumed perfect unitary evolution and initial state preparation for the system .",
    "this assumption is partially justified by the fact that a very good control of the quantum dynamics has been now achieved for trapped ions and also because they are well isolated from their environment .",
    "in fact , many experiments have shown that dissipative effects on the vibrational motion can be considered completely negligible for long intervals of time . moreover ,",
    "spontaneous emission is also practically irrelevant because the two internal states are two hyperfine levels of the ground state .",
    "however , decoherence effects have been nonetheless observed in the motion of a laser driven trapped ion @xcite .",
    "in fact , even when the entanglement with the environment is negligible , fluctuations of some classical parameter of the system may cause non - dissipative , phase - destroying effects . in the trapped ion case ,",
    "phase decoherence is mainly caused by the fluctuations of the rabi frequency , which are induced by the laser intensity fluctuations , making the coupling constant @xmath96 fluctuate .",
    "a quantitative explanation of the decoherence observed in the rabi oscillations of ref .",
    "@xcite , in terms of a fluctuating laser pulse area , has been recently provided by bonifacio _",
    "et al_. in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a model - independent formalism able to describe non - dissipative decoherence phenomena due to the fluctuations of classical parameters or internal variables of a system .    in the model - independent approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamical quantities in the presence of non - dissipative decoherence can be obtained simply through an average over an appropriate probability distribution of the fluctuating parameter . in the trapped ion case , the random parameter is the positive dimensionless random variable @xmath97 , which is proportional to the laser pulse area .",
    "in fact , the quantity @xmath98 is a stochastic coupling constant , whose fluctuations have to be traced back to the laser intensity fluctuations .",
    "the time evolution of a generic dynamical quantity @xmath99 becomes therefore the averaged quantity @xmath100",
    "the probability distribution @xmath101 is the gamma distribution function @xmath102 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by imposing the semigroup condition for the averaged density matrix of the system .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ agamma ] ) can be easily understood by considering the mean and the variance of the probability distribution ( [ agamma ] ) , @xmath104 implying that @xmath96 has now to be meant as a _",
    "mean _ coupling constant , and that @xmath105 quantifies the strength of @xmath106 fluctuations . in ref .",
    "@xcite the decay of the rabi oscillations observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is well fitted assuming @xmath107 sec ( see also @xcite ) . in this case , the relevant experimental timescale @xmath68 is much larger than @xmath103 and in this limit the gamma distribution function can be well approximated by the following gaussian distribution @xmath108     defined in the text , at the time instant @xmath109 , as a function of the laser pulse area fluctuation strength parameter @xmath103 ( expressed in seconds ) , in the case of a total initial vibrational quanta @xmath78 and for @xmath110 hz.,width=302 ]    the experimentally observed quantity is the probability of finding the ion in its ground electronic state @xmath111 . in the presence of the fluctuating coupling constant @xmath98 caused by the intensity fluctuations of the coupling lasers ,",
    "this probability has therefore to be averaged over the gaussian distribution ( [ gauap ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ ci ] ) we find @xmath112 , \\label{pdeco}\\ ] ] where the quantum coherent oscillations at frequencies @xmath113 are now exponentially decaying because of the non - dissipative decoherence .    to quantify the robustness of the parity - dependent entanglement with respect to the various experimental imperfections",
    ", we have considered the quantity @xmath114 , defined as the difference between the values assumed by @xmath115 in correspondence to @xmath80 ( odd ) and @xmath116 total initial vibrational excitations , at the `` intermediate '' time @xmath117 . with no imperfections and @xmath90 ,",
    "one has @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , @xmath120 , so that @xmath121 whatever @xmath80 is .",
    "we emphasize that such a result highlights the fact that the probability @xmath122 of finding the ion in its electronic ground level at @xmath123 depends on @xmath80 being even or odd .",
    "as long as the effect of phase decoherence increases , the difference between the odd @xmath80 case and the even @xmath80 case tends to zero , because in both cases the system state becomes the same statistical mixture and @xmath114 tends to zero .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the dependence of the probability difference @xmath114 as a function of the laser pulse area fluctuation strength @xmath103 , in the case when @xmath78 and @xmath124 .",
    "one can see the expected decay to zero of @xmath114 for increasing @xmath103 ( i.e. , increasing laser intensity fluctuations ) ; in particular one has a well visible transition from a quantum behaviour at small @xmath103 to a completely decoherent behaviour at larger @xmath103 , taking place at a threshold value @xmath125 sec . since current experimental situations correspond to @xmath126 sec",
    ", this means that the parity - dependent entanglement effect described in the preceding section can be experimentally detected even with the unavoidable presence of non - dissipative decoherence sources , as for example laser intensity fluctuations .",
    "another important condition for the observability of the parity effect reported in this paper is the possibility of preparing the initial vibrational fock state @xmath127 along the direction @xmath128 at @xmath129 radians with respect to @xmath130 .",
    "it is however not difficult to guess that at the end of any scheme aimed at preparing a vibrational ionic fock state containing exactly @xmath80 vibrational quanta , the state effectively reached is a vibrational density matrix @xmath131 containing also diagonal terms diffeent from @xmath132 in the total vibrational energy eigenbasis .",
    "of course , such a mixture of initial odd and even total vibrational quanta counters the possibility of observing the parity dependent entanglement .",
    "however , we shall show that the degree of preparation efficiency required in order to keep the parity effect in the dynamics of our system appears realistically in the grasp of the experimentalists .",
    "in other words we shall prove that the occurrence of parity effects , although attenuated , turns out to be compatible with the initial state preparation fidelity presently achievable for ionic vibrational states .",
    "we assume that at @xmath67 the initial vibrational state can be described as follows : @xmath133 @xmath134 being the normalization constant .",
    "equation  ( [ ro ] ) is a gaussian weighted mixture of pure fock states @xmath135 along the direction @xmath128 , centered on a prefixed number @xmath80 of vibrational quanta and controlled by a width parameter @xmath136 .",
    "it is immediate to see that when @xmath137 @xmath131 tends to @xmath138 .",
    "the form given to @xmath131 suggests the introduction of the parameter @xmath139 describing the efficiency of initial state preparation . @xmath140 and @xmath141 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) are the probabilities of having @xmath116 or @xmath80 quanta in the initial vibrational fock state . with the help of equations ( [ pdeco ] ) and ( [ ro ] ) ,",
    "it is not difficult to verify that , in the presence of both laser intensity fluctuations and imperfect initial state preparation , the probability to find the ion in the internal ground state @xmath142 , @xmath143 , assumes the form @xmath144 \\label{pdeco2}\\ ] ] as we have done in the preceding section , we quantify the robustness of the parity - dependent effect in terms of the probability difference @xmath114 defined above . in fig .",
    "5 @xmath114 is plotted as a function of the preparation efficiency @xmath145 for three different values of the fluctuation strength parameter , @xmath146 sec ( solid line ) , @xmath147 sec ( dotted line ) and @xmath148 sec ( dashed line ) , again in the case @xmath78 , @xmath110 hz . as expected , one has a steady increase of @xmath114 for increasing preparation efficiency .",
    "in particular , if we assume the realistic parameters @xmath149 and @xmath150 sec , one can see that the parity dependent entanglement effect is still visible , although attenuated by almost 40% .     at the time instant @xmath109 as a function of the efficiency of the initial state preparation @xmath145 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) ) for @xmath146 sec ( solid line ) , @xmath151 sec ( dotted line ) and @xmath148 sec ( dashed line ) .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed how some experimental imprecisions influence a nonclassical effect we have brought to light and discussed in a previous paper @xcite , namely the parity dependent entanglement effect . according to this effect by changing only one vibrational quantum in an initial condition characterized by a total number of oscillatory quanta @xmath90 , the state of the system , at approximately the same instant of time @xmath152 , drastically changes .",
    "indeed at this time instant the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom of the ion are maximally entangled ( i.e. maximum reduced entropy ) for even @xmath80 and disentangled for odd @xmath80 .",
    "the parity dependent quantum effect has a nonclassical origin since it stems from the granularity of the oscillatory energy of the center of mass of the ion .",
    "for this reason we believe it s worth being experimentally verified . we have thus studied the robustness of the effect with respect to various experimental imperfection . since single trapped ions are essentially dissipationless systems , we have considered the effect of non - dissipative decoherence sources as the intensity fluctuations of the coupling lasers , and also the effect of an imperfect initial state preparation .",
    "the main result of the paper is that the parity - dependent entanglement is quite robust against these experimental imperfections and that it can be experimentally seen using presently available technology .",
