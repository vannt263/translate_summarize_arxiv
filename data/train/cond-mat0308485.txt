    "down scaling mosfets to their limiting sizes is a key challenge of the semiconductor industry .",
    "detailed simulations that capture the transport and the quantum mechanical effects that occur in these devices can complement experimental work in addressing this challenge .",
    "furthermore , a conceptual view of the nanoscale transistor is needed to support the interpretation of the simulations and experimental data as well as to guide further experimental work .",
    "the objective of this work is to provide such a view by formulating a detailed quantum - mechanical transport model and performing extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we develop a model along these lines for the nanosize soi , or thin film mosfet , since the suppression of the short - channel effect seems to be most adequately addressed by this technology .",
    "therefore , understanding the soi mosfet including its quantum - mechanical transport properties is urgently needed . in this work ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the steady - state current - voltage characteristics .",
    "the soi mosfet @xcite is a transistor , built on a thin silicon layer , which is separated from the substrate by an insulating layer ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in the nanoscale transistor",
    ", we have to optimize device functionality and reliability . to achieve this goal",
    ", we need to suppress any short - channel effects as much as possible .",
    "these effects include threshold voltage variations versus channel length and the drain - induced barrier lowering effect , i.e. a drain voltage dependence of threshold voltage , which complicates transistor design at a circuit level . frank _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite recently showed , that increasing the channel doping concentration , @xmath1 , suppresses short - channel effects .",
    "the integration of the down - scaled devices requires that the gate insulating layer thickness should be reduced and/or higher dielectric constant of the insulator are implemented .",
    "si - based mosfets with typical sizes about 100  nm have found an application in highly integrated systems .",
    "mechanisms of the electron transport in these devices differ from those in the devices of 50  nm and below .",
    "the conventional devices are described by the boltzmann transport equation and approximation thereof .",
    "this theories focus on scattering - dominant transport , which typically occurs in long channel devices . on the contrary , in a structure with a characteristic size of the order of the mean free path , the electron transport is essentially quasi - ballistic .    to describe the electron transport through a nanoscale transistor ,",
    "a quantum - mechanical treatment is required .",
    "this includes the following approaches : the non - equilibrium green s function formalism of keldysh and kadanoff - baym @xcite , the pauli master equation method @xcite , the full density matrix method @xcite and wigner function method @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is the investigation of quantum transport in a nanosize mosfet .",
    "consequently , quantum effects such as quantum reflection and quantum tunnelling , occur in the electron transport .",
    "simultaneously , electron scattering should be taken into account . due to a low electron - scattering rate , the sub-50  nm devices are expected to offer higher speed performance than the conventional devices do . in a conventional mosfet ,",
    "the conductance is determined by the scattering rate of electrons in the channel , and the velocity of charge carriers is limited to a maximal value of about 10@xmath2  cm / s . in mosfets",
    "with the channel length less than the mean free path , a velocity overshoot effect occurs @xcite .",
    "the small length of the channel results into an increased on - state current and a reduced gate capacitance . for example , in ref.@xcite the fabrication of sub-0.1  @xmath3 m mosfets was reported .",
    "the resulting devices demonstrate a rather good performance in a wide range of temperatures .    in @xcite , a flexible two - dimensional model has been developed , that optimally combines analytical and numerical methods and describes the key features of cylindrical soi mosfet devices .",
    "the theoretical tools to describe the quantum transport features involve the wigner distribution function formalism  @xcite , in which a boltzmann collision term representing acoustics phonons , impurity and surface - roughness scattering was incorporated .",
    "therefore this model is capable to probe the competition between three effects : quantum reflection , quantum tunnelling and phase de - coherence due to elastic scattering .",
    "the wigner function formalism offers many advantages for quantum modelling @xcite .",
    "first , it is a phase - space distribution , similar to classical distributions . because of the phase - space nature of the distribution",
    ", it is conceptually possible to use the correspondence principle in order to determine , where quantum corrections enter the problem . at the boundaries ,",
    "the phase - space description allows for separation of incoming and outgoing components of the distribution , which therefore permits the modelling an ideal contact , and hence an open system @xcite . by coupling the equation for the wigner function to the poisson equation",
    ", we obtain a fully - self - consistent model of the soi mosfet .",
    "this paper is organized as follows  : in section  ii , a description of the system is presented in terms of a one - electron hamiltonian . in section  iii the quantum liouville equation satisfied by the electron density matrix is transformed into a set of one - dimensional equations for partial wigner functions .",
    "the boundary conditions for the wigner function are considered in section iv .",
    "the ballistic regime of the structure described in section v. a one - dimensional collision term is derived in section  vi , in which we extend earlier work @xcite by also including scattering due to interface roughness . in section vii , we describe a numerical model to solve the equations for the wigner function . in section  viii , the results of the numerical calculations are discussed .",
    "we consider a @xmath4-channel soi mosfet structure .",
    "when a positive gate voltage is applied , electrons in the channel are confined to a narrow inversion layer near si / sio@xmath0 interface .",
    "the current flows in the @xmath5-direction , the confinement is in the @xmath6-direction , and the width of the transistor is found along the @xmath7-direction .",
    "the source and drain regions with the lengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , are @xmath4-doped by phosphorus with concentration @xmath10 , whereas the @xmath11-doped channel with the length @xmath12 has concentration @xmath13 of boron acceptors .",
    "the lateral surface of the semiconductor brick in the channel region is covered by the sio@xmath0 oxide layer , while the aluminum gate overlays the oxide layer .    in the semiconductor ,",
    "the electron motion is determined by the following hamiltonian  : @xmath14 where @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the potential energy associated with the energy barrier and the electrostatic field ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the effective masses of the motion along the @xmath20 @xmath7 and @xmath5-axes , respectively , of an electron of the @xmath21-th valley .",
    "the schrdinger equation is solved within an effective mass approximation .",
    "it is assumed that si / sio@xmath0 interface is parallel to the ( 100 ) plane .",
    "the conduction band in bulk silicon can be represented by six equivalent ellipsoids . when an electric field is applied in the [ 100 ]  -direction ,",
    "these six equivalent minima split into two sets of subbands @xcite .",
    "the first set of subbands ( unprimed ) is two fold degenerate and represents those ellipsoids that respond with a heavy effective mass in the direction of the applied electric field .",
    "because of the heavier mass , the ` unprimed ' subbands have relatively lower bound - state energies , as compared to the ` primed ' subbands and are therefore primarily occupied by electrons @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic potential energy @xmath22 satisfies poisson s equation @xmath23   = \\frac{e^{2}}{\\varepsilon_{0}}\\biggl(-n({\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{r}}})+n_{\\mathrm{d}}({\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{r}}})-n_{\\mathrm{a}}({\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{r}}})\\biggr)\\;,\\quad i=1,2\\ ; , \\label{poisson}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the dielectric constants of the semiconductor and oxide layers , respectively ; @xmath26 , @xmath27and @xmath28 are the concentrations of electrons , donors and acceptors , respectively .",
    "the barrier potential is non - zero in both oxide layers , and its value is denoted by a constant  @xmath29 . in our calculations , we assume that the source electrode is grounded whereas the potentials at the drain and gate electrodes equal @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . the system is assumed to be uniform in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "consequently , the electron density is constant along the @xmath7-axis and the edge effects in that direction are supposed to be negligible .    the study of the charge distribution in the cylindrical mosfet with closed gate electrode in the state of the thermodynamical equilibrium ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) has shown that the concentration of holes is much lower than that of electrons , so that electron transport is found to provide the main contribution to the current flowing through the soi mosfet .",
    "for that reason , holes are neglected in the present transport calculations .",
    "in order to study the device architecture starting from the wigner function formalism , an equation is needed that describes the response of the wigner function to changing external conditions .",
    "the time evolution of the wigner function is derived from the quantum liouville equation by applying the wigner - weyl transformation . neglecting inter - valley transitions in the conduction band",

    "being part of an electrical circuit , it exchanges electrons with the circuit . for the present purposes , the term open system  is used here to characterize a system that is connected to contacts ( reservoirs of particles ) and the interaction between the system and a contact necessarily involves a particle current through an interface between the system and contacts .",
    "the quantum liouville equation ( in the wigner - weyl representation ) is of the first order with respect to the coordinate @xmath55  and does not contain derivatives with respect to the momentum .",
    "the characteristics of the derivative term are lines of constant momentum , and we need to supply one and _ only _ one boundary value at some point on each characteristic , because the equation is of first order with respect to the coordinate @xmath55 .",

    "but when the broadening of inverse layer levels due to inter  -subband scattering is sufficiently small in comparison with subband energy separations , we can neglect such off  -diagonal parts and use the transport equation ( [ liov6 ] ) , which becomes a set of decoupled equations for distribution functions associated with each subband @xmath79 , i.e. in this case the electrons in the different subbands can be considered independent current carriers .",
    "the transition rates depend upon the full set of quantum numbers of each three - dimensional state .",

    "7 illustrates the drain current @xmath164  versus the gate voltage @xmath31  of @xmath165 nm channel - length soi mosfet for drain voltage @xmath166 v. we can see that the threshold voltage  of the transistor is @xmath167 0.0 v. the influence of the scattering on the current diminishes as the the gate voltage lowers .",
    "this fact is due to a reduced electron concentration resulting into a lower amplitude of the scattering process .",
    "the decrease of the electron concentration , together with an increasing source - channel junction barrier , leads to the reduction of the current through the channel .",
    "7 also informs us that we are still far removed from the international technology roadmap for semiconductors ( itrs ) requirements @xcite .",
    "in particular , whereas the on - state current ( @xmath167 5 a / cm ) is in the range of the requirements ( @xmath167 7.5 a / cm ) , the off - state current ( 0.5 a / cm ) is far above target ( @xmath167 0.0015 a / cm ) . therefore , further optimization of the silicon - film thickness as well as channel - doping engineering is needed .    in fig .",
    "8 the contours of the absolute value of the ground - state wigner function ( @xmath168 ) are plotted with and without the presence of scattering for structures with channel lengths @xmath169 nm ( the first row)@xmath170 nm ( the second row)@xmath171  nm ( the third row ) . in these figures",
    "the first column corresponds to the ballistic regime , the second and the third correspond to the regime with scattering due to ionized impurities , acoustic phonons and surface roughness at the si / sio@xmath0 interface with the average displacement @xmath159  nm and @xmath160  nm respectively .",
    "darker areas in these plots indicate higher density of electrons . far away from the @xmath11@xmath4 junctions",
    "where the effective potential is varying almost linearly with @xmath5 , the partial wigner function is positive definite and can be interpreted as a probability distribution of electrons in phase space .",
    "when electrons are accelerated in the inversion layer without scattering , their velocity increases monotonously along the whole channel .",
    "therefore , in the phase - space representation , the distribution of ballistic electrons looks as a narrow jet stream pointing from the source to the drain along the channel , while scattering is seen to wash out the electron jet in the channel .",
    "consequently , the electron transport through the channel combines the elements of both diffusive and ballistic motion .",
    "the mean - free - path less than the device length does not mean that the device is near - ballistic .    in this paper",
    "we have studied in detail the effects of ultra - short channels in an soi mosfet . to benefit from the soi architecture , the thickness of the channel",
    "should be reduced to 10 nm or less .",
    "the simultaneous scaling of the channel length and thickness is currently under study .",

    "we consider the electron scattering due to impurities , acoustic phonons and surface roughness at the si - sio@xmath0 interface . in case of the electron scattering due to impurities @xcite",
    "@xmath90 is the electron - impurity potential minus its spatial average .",
    "the latter term has already been included in energy level calculations ( band bending calculations ) , when solving poisson and wigner equations self - consistently .",
    "this spatial average being , by definition , translation invariant in the layer plane , has a zero matrix element between initial and final plane wave states and can thus be dropped .",
    "the impurities are assumed to be randomly placed at the sites @xmath172 .",
    "the hamiltonian describing scattering due to the impurities in the inversion layer is given by @xmath173 where @xmath174 here @xmath175 is the thomas - fermi screening constant and @xmath176 and @xmath177 are form - factors , corresponding to the screening impurity potential  @xcite . because the screening effect in the channel is very large , as seen in the refs .",
    "@xcite , we can model the scattering potential of an ionized impurity as @xmath178 , where @xmath179 determines a cross - section for scattering by an impurity .",
    "consequently , the absolute value of the matrix element is @xmath180 averaging this over a uniform distribution of impurities results in the following scattering rate @xmath181 where@xmath182 @xmath13 is the acceptor concentration and @xmath183 .",
    "lattice vibrations are an inevitable source of scattering , and we need to take them into account when we calculate device characteristics at room temperature . in this work we restrict ourselves to intra - valley and intra - subband acoustic phonon scattering . in the approximation of an isotropic elastic continuum",
    "we have @xmath184   = \\sum_{{\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{q}}}}\\left (   \\gamma_{{\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{q}}}}b_{{\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{q}}}}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}{\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{q\\cdot r}}})+h.c.\\right )   \\;,\\ ] ] with @xcite@xmath185 @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 respectively denote the deformation potential , the mass density of the semiconductor and phonon frequency .",

    "the emission ( + ) and absorption ( - ) rates are @xmath192 at room temperature both expressions are approximately the same .",
    "indeed , for @xmath141  k the thermal energy @xmath124 largely exceeds the phonon energy @xmath193 , and therefore the acoustic deformation can be considered elastic . for low energies , we can approximate the phonon occupation number as @xmath194 and adopt the debye model @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the sound velocity . assuming equipartition of energy in the acoustic modes , we obtain the scattering rate  : @xmath197 with @xmath198    ideally",
    ", the si - sio@xmath0 interfaces would coincide with a planes @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the real interfaces however are known to fluctuate randomly around these planes and , under the assumption that the boundary between si and si - sio@xmath0 is still abrupt , the local deviations due to surface roughness may be characterized by a quasi - continuous function @xmath201 .",
    "here @xmath202 represents the two - dimensional position vector parallel with the ideal interfaces .",
    "we further assume that the surface potential varies linearly with @xmath203 , i.e. @xmath204 neglecting the effect of surface roughness on the subband energies and wave functions , we may calculate the scattering matrix element for surface roughness to the lowest order in @xmath203  as follows @xcite : @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 is the fourier transform of the @xmath208@xmath209 in the born approximation , only the magnitude squared of @xmath210 ( referred to as the power spectrum ) is needed , and thus the phase of @xmath210 can be neglected .",
    "we propose a gaussian distribution to describe the spatial correlation of the surface roughness @xmath211 where @xmath203 is the root - mean - square value of @xmath201 , and @xmath212 , is referred to as the correlation length governing the the decay of the auto - correlation function . in the above expression",
