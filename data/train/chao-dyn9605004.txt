    "in the last few decades the theoretical investigation of two - dimensional euclidian and riemannian geometries , so - called billiards , has led to a very fruitful new discipline in non - linear physics @xcite . due to the conserved energy of the ideal particle propagating inside the billiard s boundaries with specular reflections on the walls",
    ", the plain billiard belongs to the class of hamiltonian systems with the lowest degree of freedom in which chaos can occur and this does only depend on the given boundary shape .",
    "because of their simplicity two - dimensional billiards are in particular adequate to study the behaviour of the particle in the corresponding quantum regime @xcite where spectral properties are completely described by the stationary schrdinger - equation @xmath2 inside the domain @xmath3 with dirichlet boundary conditions on the walls @xmath4 in this context the investigation of `` quantum chaos '' has become one of the most fascinating goals of theoretical physics at the end of this century @xcite .",
    "about five years ago experimentalists have even found very effective techniques to simulate the quantum billiard problem with the help of macroscopic devices . due to the equivalence of the stationary schrdinger - equation and the classical helmholtz - equation in two dimensions",
    "one is able to model the billiard by a similarly shaped electromagnetic cavity @xcite . in former publications",
    "we have demonstrated the high accuracy of large ensembles of measured eigenvalues as well as of resonance shapes and the attached widths in _ superconducting _ cavities formed like desymmetrized bunimovich and truncated hyperbola billiards @xcite .",
    "especially the statistical analysis of measured ( or numerically simulated ) eigenvalue sequences confirms that a distinction between classical chaotic and regular systems from the quantum point of view is only possible in the semiclassical regime ( formally spoken for @xmath5 ) where the particle s de broglie wavelength is sensitive to details of the billiard s borderline .",
    "one of the most surprising and primarily empirical results of these investigations is the fact that quantum spectra of classical chaotic hamiltonian systems can be described in a universal manner which only depends on the global symmetry of the underlying dynamics : the quantum pendants of time - reversal invariant classically chaotic systems typically reveal spectral structures which are reproduced excellently by statistical properties of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrix theory @xcite . on the other hand classically regular systems",
    "usually lead to spectral fluctuations on the wave dynamical side according to uncorrelated poissonlike distributed random numbers @xcite .    in this article",
    "we present first investigations which were performed on a three - dimensional superconducting billiard . due to the polarization properties of the electromagnetic fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 inside the cavity the full vectorial helmholtz - equations @xcite @xmath8 have to be used with corresponding boundary conditions @xmath9 on the walls which are assumed to be ideally conducting .",
    "of course the analogy with the corresponding scalar schrdinger - equation in the same geometry is fully lost .",
    "instead of talking of the semiclassical limit we have to describe the classical electromagnetic billiard in this region in terms of ray - optical characteristics , where features of the periodic orbits inside the geometry dominate the corresponding wave optical side .",
    "three - dimensional systems have so far only scarcely been investigated experimentally . to our knowledge",
    "first experiments with electromagnetic waves in cavities simulating acoustic wave phenomena in rooms were performed by schrder @xcite . acoustic model statistics in metal blocks",
    "have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "very recently statistical properties of eigenfrequency distributions in asymmetrically shaped microwave cavities have been reported @xcite .",
    "theoretically quantum effects as well as their electromagnetic counterparts in three - dimensional systems were treated in refs . @xcite .",
    "we have investigated a small deformed 3d - cavity made from an open deep drawn niobium cup ( a gift , which we had received from the director of the continuous electron beam accelerator facility , cebaf , hermann grunder ) with a welded lid to cover it . before welding the two parts together , the cup was deformed at its open end to destroy its rotational symmetry .",
    "its measures are given in fig.1 .",
    "the total volume of the resonator was determined by filling it with water and measuring the additional weight , yielding a volume of @xmath10 .",
    "the shape of the cup can be approximated by cutting a three - axial ellipsoid twice perpendicular to its main axis ( see also fig.1 ) and then deforming it slightly .",
    "the microwaves were transmitted into and out of the cavity by two small antennas in the lid .",
    "the whole resonator was cooled down in helium - atmosphere at a temperature of 2k and a pressure of 38 mbar in one of the cryostats of the superconducting darmstadt electron linear accelerator s - dalinac @xcite together with the accelerating structures . with this setup",
    "we have measured microwave spectra in transmission ( antenna 1 for input and antenna 2 for output ) as well as in reflection ( same antenna for excitation and detection ) using a hewlett packard network analyzer ( model hp8510b ) in a frequency range between 0 and 20ghz , respectively .",
    "spectra were taken in 10khz steps and fig.2 shows an extraction of the transmission spectrum between 15 and 20ghz where typical q - values of up to @xmath11 and signal - to - noise ratios of up to 50db were obtained . by comparing the three measured spectra 286 resonances",
    "could be consistently identified which form the base of all following investigations .    for an analysis of this set however one has to take into account the following point : since the geometry of the cup is very close to one which possesses two symmetry planes ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 plane , see fig.1 ) the given set of resonances in the analysis is always compared to a superposition of four independent subspectra .",
    "in order to derive meaningful statistical measures for the given eigenvalue sequence it is first necessary to extract the smooth part of the resonator s density of eigenmodes which is given by the generalized electromagnetic weyl - formula @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the volume of the cavity and @xmath16 the upper frequency limit of the given spectrum .",
    "the constant term contains contributions of the surface s curvature as well as of the edges of the cavity .",
    "the total density of eigenmodes contains in addition a fluctuating part @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the eigenfrequencies of the resonances .",
    "it is very instructive to compare eq.([density ] ) with the corresponding expression for the three - dimensional schrdinger - problem in the same geometry , i.e. @xmath19 due to the already mentioned polarization features of the modes , the leading term in the electromagnetic formula , eq.([density ] ) , is twice the corresponding term in the scalar problem , eq.([qmdensity ] ) , because of two transverse directions of polarization relative to the axis of propagation .",
    "in addition these two polarizations which are known as tm- and te - modes in certain geometries provide linear terms in the smoothed eigenmode density of the same magnitude but with different sign .",
    "thus due to cancellation there is no linear contribution in eq.([density ] ) , whereas this term survives in the scalar case and is proportional to the cavity s surface @xmath20 .",
    "even if a clear separation in the attached tm- and te - modes is not possible in cases of arbitrary geometries , like in the case of our cup , this linear term vanishes for all piecewise smooth boundaries @xcite .",
    "the constant terms in both eqs .",
    "( [ density ] ) and (    [ qmdensity ] ) are of the same origin , i.e. the curvature of the surface and the edge angles of the cavity .    to determine the spectral fluctuations , the smooth part of the eigenmode density in the measured spectrum had to be eliminated .",
    "for this we constructed from eq.([densitytotal ] ) the staircase function @xmath21 and obtained its fluctuating part @xmath22 since in the case of our billiard there is no analytical form for the edge contribution of the constant term of eq.([density ] ) we have fitted a third order polynomial ( without the quadratic term ) to the experimental staircase function , i.e. @xmath23 in fig.3 the remaining fluctuating part of the staircase function can be seen to oscillate around zero as expected , the fitted constant @xmath24 corresponds to a volume of @xmath25 which is very close to the correct value of @xmath10 .",
    "this difference in the leading term corresponds to an uncertainty of 4 resonances in the measured total spectrum ( neglecting the linear and constant term in eq.([nsmooth ] ) ) .      in order to perform a statistical analysis of the given eigenvalue sequence independently from the special size of the resonator ,",
    "the spectrum was first unfolded , i.e. from the measured sequence of eigenfrequencies @xmath26 the spacing @xmath27 between adjacent eigenmodes was obtained by calculating the local average @xmath28 from eq.([nsmooth ] ) .",
    "the proper normalization of the measured spacings of eigenmodes then yielded the desired nearest neighbour distribution p(s ) , i.e. the probability for a certain spacing s.    by comparing p(s ) to theoretical expressions one has to take into account , however , that the mechanically only weakly deformed cup ( fig.1 ) can to a good approximation be constructed of four similar quartercups which separately possess the full geometrical information of the object , in which case the measured spectrum would be a superposition of four independent symmetry classes which are obtained by permuting the boundary conditions on the cutting planes of the quartercup from electric to magnetic , respectively .",
    "hence one has to be aware of this point in the following statistical analysis of eigenmode spacings .    furthermore , to obtain a quantitative criterion concerning the degree of chaoticity in the system the spectrum was analyzed in terms of statistical measures from a model of berry and robnik @xcite which interpolates between the two limiting cases of pure poissonian and pure goe behaviour for classical regular and chaotic systems , respectively .",
    "the final essence of this model is a mixing - parameter @xmath29 which is directly related to the relative chaotic part of the invariant liouville measure of the underlying classical phase space in which the motion takes place . according to the herein embedded one - to - one connection between classical phase space and eigenmode density for the two different regions of regular and chaotic motion ,",
    "a comparison becomes meaningful only for the highly excited domain of the spectrum which is not sufficiently covered by the frequency range up to 20ghz investigated here .    in the upper part of fig.4",
    "the result for the nearest neighbour spacing distribution @xmath30 which describes , as already mentioned , short range correlations between neighbouring unfolded levels is shown in form of a histogram .",
    "with respect to the superposition of four independent symmetry classes , as noted above , the model of berry and robnik makes the following ansatz for an interpolation between pure poissonian and pure gaussian characteristics @xmath31\\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\exp{(-{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}{(\\frac{q}{4})}^2{s^2 } ) }   erfc^3\\big({\\frac{\\sqrt\\pi}{2 } } { \\frac{q}{4}}s\\big)+\\nonumber\\\\ & & 12(\\frac{q}{4})^2 \\exp(-2{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}(\\frac{q}{4})^2 s^2 ) erfc^2\\big ( { \\frac{\\sqrt\\pi}{2}}{\\frac{q}{4}}s\\big ) \\bigg)\\nonumber~ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for inspection the limiting curves of a superposition of four independent pure poissonians ( @xmath32 ) , which again yields one single poissonian , as well as of four independent goes ( @xmath33 ) are also represented in the figure .",
    "note that the superposition results in a clear loss of linear level repulsion for small spacings in the case of pure goe statistics .",
    "furthermore there is not much distinction between poissonian and goe statistics , anyhow .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath30 does not allow to determine the mixing parameter @xmath29 with reasonable significance , since the fluctuations in the data are larger than the difference between the given smooth curves . to be free of effects due to the binning of @xmath30",
    "we have also calculated the cumulative nearest neighbour spacing distribution @xmath34 the result is presented in fig.4 , lower part , together with the curves for the pure distributions , poisson and 4xgoe . in this case",
    "the measured spacings are very close to poissonian behaviour over a large range of s. a fit of @xmath35 to the data yields @xmath36 , where the uncertainty was determined from analyzing different subsets of the measured data .",
    "because of this rather poor sensitivity other statistical measures like the number variance and spectral rigidity had to be applied to the data to determine @xmath29 .      in order to check for long range correlations between the measured levels",
    "we have calculated @xmath37 as well as @xmath38statistics , two measures originally introduced by dyson and mehta @xcite for studies in equivalent fluctuations of nuclear spectra . in this case one",
    "is interested in spectral correlations on a scale which contains l mean level spacings . here",
    "@xmath39 represents the averaged variance of a number @xmath40 of levels belonging to an interval of length @xmath41 on the unfolded axis with mean @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is a smoothed and rescaled version of @xmath44 and can be calculated from @xmath45 figure 5 shows the experimental results for these two measures as well as the fitted curve according to berry and robnik @xcite deduced from @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the distributions for the pure cases and one symmetry class . an equivalent formula is valid for @xmath43 . as in the case of the nearest neighbour spacing distribution",
    "the superposition of four pure poissonians yields one single poissonian which can be directly seen from the analytical expression @xmath49 inspecting fig.5 two results have to be noted : firstly , the experimental number variance @xmath50 lies clearly between the limiting curves of pure poissonian and gaussian characteristics . a fit of the expression ( [ sig44 ] ) to the data",
    "yields a mixing - parameter of @xmath44 , @xmath51 , which agrees within the given error range with to the @xmath29-value derived from the cumulative nearest neighbour spacing distribution . on the other hand the @xmath52curve only corresponds within the given error range of the data with this result , i.e. a deviation from pure poissonian behaviour is basically not visible .",
    "secondly , the number variance @xmath44 clearly displays saturation above a certain value @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , berry showed @xcite that a global and universal semiclassical ( or ray - optical ) behaviour can only be expected between @xmath54 and the value @xmath53 which is determined on one hand by the finite ensemble of resonances , but above all by the lengths of the shortest periodic orbits of the classical system . from fig.5",
    "we find @xmath55 for @xmath50 .",
    "note , that @xmath53 of @xmath56 is well approximated by four times @xmath53 of @xmath50 ( see eq.([delta3 ] ) and @xcite ) . using a modification of berry s expression @xcite for the electromagnetic case , @xmath53 of @xmath56 can be related to an average length @xmath57 of the shortest periodic orbits via the expression @xmath58 where @xmath59 is equal to the first term @xmath60 in eq.([nsmooth ] ) and @xmath61 denotes the upper frequency , i.e. @xmath62ghz . the result is @xmath63 m in fair agreement with a value deduced independently in sect.e below .",
    "in addition to @xmath44 and @xmath43 we have also calculated another long range statistics : the two - level form factor @xmath64 in the corresponding time domain @xcite which leads to a so - called  autocorrelation hole  in the case of a goe - like sequence .",
    "it turns out that the fluctuations in @xmath65 due to the small number of resonances are to large for a proper conclusion and even in the pure goe - case the hole is not very pronounced due to the superposition of symmetry classes .    to summarize the statistical investigation , only the cumulative nearest neighbour spacing distribution @xmath35 and the number variance @xmath50 lead to a significant deviation from pure poissonian behaviour for the given set of resonances .",
    "furthermore the extracted mixing parameter @xmath29 represents an upper limit for the chaoticity since the assumption of a superposition of four symmetry classes in the statistical analysis increases the weight of the pure goe - contribution with respect to the desymmetrized case .      in order to obtain an independent estimate for the degree of chaoticity in the system",
    "we have also performed a numerical simulation of classical motion inside the 3d - cup .",
    "following an idea of zaslavsky and strauss @xcite we have approximated the resonator s geometry by one half of a so - called barrel billiard which can be obtained by cutting a three - axial ellipsoid in two different heights perpendicular to the longest of its axis , see also fig.1 .",
    "consequently the surface of the barrel can be described by the curve @xmath66\\ ] ] and the resonator was modelled with axes @xmath67mm/2,@xmath68mm/2 and cuts at @xmath69 and @xmath70 mm . with respect to these parameters",
    "the relative geometrical difference in the volume between the cup resonator and the barrel billiard is about @xmath71 .    to characterize the classical motion of a particle inside this  half of a barrel geometry  a two - dimensional area preserving mapping also introduced in @xcite was used for creating the underlying poincar surface of section .",
    "the base of this mapping is simply a pair of a coordinate and its conjugated momentum @xmath72 of the particle during each reflection on the wall .",
    "note that the momentum @xmath73 is normalized to unity .",
    "figure 6 shows the resulting patterns in phase space after 16000 collisions with the boundary . because the full ellipsoid is totally regular @xcite there exists a class of trajectories ( also shown in fig.6 ) manifested by regular stripes on the surface of section which indicate remaining regularities inside the cup .",
    "this is due to the fact that these trajectories do not impact on the plane at @xmath74 which exactly is the reason for overfocussing features of the geometry and consequently the origin of chaos .",
    "the relative area of the chaotic part of phase space , the so - called  chaotic sea  , was estimated by an invariant chaotic liouville measure of @xmath75 using a drastically increased number of about @xmath76 wallcollisions to get a higher accuracy .",
    "this is bigger than the mixing - parameter deduced from @xmath35 and @xmath50 , but it has to be noted that the applicability of the berry - robnik - model was originally shown to depend strongly upon reaching the semiclassical ( or ray - optical ) limit which in the two - dimensional case is established only far beyond thousands of eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "the present case of only close to three hundred eigenvalues at least points to the correct tendency for the correspondence between the classical liouville measure and the wave dynamical mixing - parameter extracted from the data .      as a final study of semiclassical features of our wave dynamical system",
    ", we have analyzed the spectrum of classical orbit length @xmath77 in the 3d - cup which is directly related to the measured frequency spectrum by a fourier transform of the above mentioned fluctuating part of the eigenmode density ( eq.([densitytotal ] ) ) , @xmath78 here @xmath79 and @xmath61 denote the borders of the measured frequency range , i.e. 0 and 20ghz .",
    "figure 7 shows in the upper part the value @xmath80 in a range of orbit lengths @xmath77 up to @xmath81 m , and in the lower part some periodic orbits obtained from numerical simulations on the barrel billiard are presented . as can be seen from the arrows below the abscissa several of those orbits correspond well to the locations of peaks in the fourier spectrum of the data .",
    "the shortest periodic orbit which bounces between the bottom and the lid has a length of @xmath82 m , which is close to the independent estimate of sect.c above .",
    "it is the so - called shortest bouncing ball orbit in the cup .",
    "this bouncing ball orbit has been analyzed in a more quantitative manner .",
    "following @xcite we have calculated an additional term of the smooth part of the staircase function , eq.([nsmooth ] ) , attached to the three - dimensional bouncing ball orbit propagating periodically between the bottom and the lid of the cup .",
    "again the contributions for both polarization classes have to be considered separately .",
    "the result for the sum of both parts as pointed out in the appendix is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 mm , the half of the bouncing ball orbit s length , i.e. the heigth of the cup .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 denotes the area on which this orbit exists , i.e. the size of the cup s bottom .",
    "the upper part of fig.7 also shows the result for the remaining length spectrum after extracting this contribution .",
    "in fact , the peak belonging to the correct length of the bouncing ball orbit does not vanish completely because it is due to a superposition of two adjacent periodic orbits , the bouncing ball orbit at @xmath82 m and a stable periodic orbit at @xmath87 m , as seen from the lower part of fig.7 .    in order to verify the new electromagnetic bouncing ball formula , eq.([3dbb2 ] ) , independently from this result we also have tested it using a set of @xmath88 eigenmodes of a regular box .",
    "this system is classically integrable , thus it is possible to calculate the electromagnetic eigenfrequencies analytically .",
    "the box also allows to study the different polarizations , te- and tm - modes , in more detail and especially their systematic degeneration which directly follows from the analytical expression for the eigenfrequencies @xmath89 in order to avoid further accidental number theoretical degeneracies the lengths of the three edges a , b and c were chosen as @xmath90 m , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , the ratio of the golden mean . following eq.([density ] ) we have calculated the exact smooth part of the staircase function for the given set of eigenfrequencies . here",
    "the linear term as well as the constant term are given analytically without any free parameter .",
    "extracting this smooth part from the total staircase of the box , eq.([totaltreppe ] ) , we obtained the fluctuating part , which is shown in the upper part of fig.8 .",
    "the present choice of the edges a , b and c yields a very clear oscillation in this fluctuating part , which is dominated by one certain classical bouncing ball orbit ( also given in fig.8 ) .",
    "the length of this orbit , @xmath94 , corresponds to the period of the observed oscillation @xmath95mhz . using the area @xmath96 for this certain orbit",
    ", we have calculated the contribution which follows from eq.([3dbb2 ] ) .",
    "this curve is also represented in the upper part of fig.8 and reproduces the data very well as it can be seen in the lower part of the same figure where the bouncing ball contribution has been extracted from the staircase function , i.e. where the modulation of @xmath97 is not present anymore .",
    "note that the impressive amplitude of the given modulation is due to the ratio @xmath98 in eq.([3dbb2 ] ) which is the largest contribution in comparison to the other possible bouncing ball orbits and also much larger than the corresponding amplitude for the 3d - cup , @xmath99 .    to perform a more obvious test of eq.([3dbb2 ] ) we again have calculated the fourier spectrum , eq.([fourint ] ) , of the calculated set of eigenfrequencies .",
    "the result is shown in fig.9 .",
    "the bouncing ball orbit leads to an impressive peak at a length @xmath100 m . using eq.([3dbb2 ] ) in the same way ,",
    "i.e. calculating the fourier transformed of @xmath101 we are able to extract this peak without any remnant as well as contributions of its multiples , which indicates that the orbit has been described correctly by eq.([3dbb2 ] ) .",
    "because of this result , which was achieved successfully for several boxes of different proportions , we are certain that the remaining peak in the length spectrum of the 3d - cup in fig.7 is due to the existence of the stable periodic orbit of 0.1170 m length .    as an additional test of statistical measures ,",
    "we have calculated the nearest neighbour spacing distribution , the @xmath37 and the @xmath38statistics for both polarizations of the box separately .",
    "this yields pure poissonian characteristics accross the whole range of spacings as expected for the given regular system . as an example , the result for the nearest neighbour spacing distribution using the first 9978 te - modes is presented in fig.10 .",
    "return to the 3d - cup : for completion we have calculated the statistical measures of the short and long range correlations after extraction of the bouncing ball contribution , i.e. we have reunfolded the experimental spectrum in adding eq.([3dbb2 ] ) to the standard weylian , eq.([nsmooth ] ) , and repeated our statistical analysis .",
    "the effect is rather weak , as can be expected because of the small amplitude of eq.([3dbb2 ] ) in the case of the cup .",
    "the procedure leads to a very slight correction of the @xmath37 and the @xmath38curves towards the pure goe - limit but its influence on the mixing parameter is much smaller than the quoted uncertainties .",
    "in summary we have applied several original quantum methods like eigenvalue statistics and periodic orbits in the given case of a purely classical , vectorial wave phenomenon . although the spectrum was checked for completeness using the correct electromagnetic weyl - formula , eq.([nsmooth ] ) ,",
    "the fluctuations around this mean behaviour are not very sensitive for the details of the boundary in the present case of only 286 resonances . on the other hand",
    "the system was analyzed in terms of periodic orbit theory . as the length spectrum of the resonator leads to more detailed conclusions ( estimations for the saturation of @xmath50 and @xmath56 via the shortest periodic orbits , identification of classicals orbit lengths and extraction of the first bouncing ball orbit ) this analysis reveals as a helpful tool for investigations in the near semiclassical limit . comparing the classical degree of chaoticity ( @xmath102 ) with the corresponding mixing parameter deduced from spectral statistics according to the model of berry and robnik , only the cumulative nearest neighbour spacing distribution @xmath35 and",
    "the number variance @xmath50 significantly deviate from the pure poissonian behaviour and show the correct tendency ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the uncertainties of the analysis are not due to fundamental difficulties but rather a consequence of the poor desymmetrization and the small size of the cup , yielding only 286 resonances in the accessible frequency range .",
    "therefore , in order to study the  three - dimensional helmholtz - chaos  in a more quantitative and proper way we have already started measurements on a precisely manufactured , fully desymmetrized 3d - sinai - billiard realized by 1/48 of a cube with a centered sphere @xcite . besides testing the usual statistical measures we will especially investigate the ray - optical generalization of gutzwiller s quantum trace formula following the very advanced ideas of balian and duplantier @xcite .",
    "we like to thank f. neumeyer and s. strauch for helpful advice concerning the numerical calculations and our mechanical workshop for the excellent fabrication of the niobium resonator .",
    "one of us , a.r . , is grateful to h. grunder for the present of the cebaf cup .",
    "this work has been supported by the sonderforschungsbereich 185  nichtlineare dynamik  of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft , in part by the bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung under contract number 06da665i , and through a max - planck - forschungspreis .",
    "first , we construct the general contribution of a bouncing ball orbit in a @xmath104-dimensional cavity ( @xmath104 @xmath105 1 ) to the spectral staircase function of non - relativistic quantum mechanics , @xmath106 with @xmath107 , and secondly we apply these general results to the electromagnetic case in @xmath108 dimensions . as usual",
    "the spectral staircase function is given as the integral over the spectral density , @xmath109 , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the mass of the non - relativistic particle inside the cavity . the spectral density in turn",
    "is given by the imaginary part of the trace of the non - relativistic green s function inside the cavity : @xmath112 here @xmath77 is half of the total length of the bouncing ball orbit and @xmath113 is the size of the smallest of the two parallel @xmath114 dimensional `` surfaces '' between which the orbit bounces .",
    "the integer @xmath115 labels the modes along the bouncing ball orbit with @xmath116 or @xmath117 for dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions on the two surfaces , respectively .",
    "the momentum component along the orbit is @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath119 dimensional momentum integration perpendicular to the bouncing ball orbit is the free unrestricted one .",
    "the factors in front of the integral are the phase space normalization factors in @xmath114 dimensions . after the insertion of eq.([d_e ] ) into eq.([n_k ] ) , the spectral staircase function reads @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the angular integral in @xmath114 dimensions . in writing down eq.([n_k_2 ] ) we used the following relation : .",
    "now the integrations in eq.([n_k_2 ] ) become simple because of the delta function . the final result for",
    "the bouncing ball orbit of a non - relativisitic particle inside a cavity in @xmath122 dimensions is therefore @xmath123 this formula applied to two dimensions reads @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the length perpendicular to the bouncing ball orbit .",
    "it agrees of course with the result of ref.@xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional expression has the form @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes the plane perpendicular to the bouncing ball orbit .",
    "the bouncing ball contribution in three dimensions to the _ fluctuating _ part of the spectral staircase function is now given by formula ( [ n_k_3d ] ) minus its contribution to the weyl or smooth part of the spectral staircase function which has to be subtracted in order to avoid double counting .",
    "the smooth part follows from eq.([n_k_3d ] ) via the application of the euler - maclaurin formula @xmath128 , where and the dots correspond to the fluctuating contribution here .",
    "thus we have @xmath129 where the last term takes into account the factor @xmath130 in front of the first term , @xmath131 , in the euler - maclaurin formula and the extra mode in the neumann case .",
    "we do not get an extra contribution from the upper boundary , as @xmath132 vanishes in the average in our case . in summary ,",
    "in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the bouncing ball contribution to the fluctuating part of the spectral staircase function in a three - dimensional cavity reads @xmath133 where the upper signs / inequalities apply to dirichlet boundary conditions on the two surfaces between which the orbit bounces , whereas the lower signs / inequalities refer to the neumann case . in the electromagnetic case",
    "these two contributions correspond to the magnetic and electric bouncing ball modes , respectively , see eq.([rand ] ) , which decouple for modes along the bouncing ball orbit .",
    "therefore we can just sum both terms to get the final expression for the bouncing ball contribution to the fluctuating part of the staircase function for an electromagnetic cavity in three dimensions : @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",

    "<S> we present first measurements on a superconducting _ three - dimensional _ , partly chaotic microwave billiard shaped like a small deformed cup . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the statistical properties of the measured spectrum in terms of several methods originally derived for quantum systems like eigenvalue statistics and periodic orbits and obtain according to a model of berry and robnik a mixing parameter of about @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in numerical simulations of the classical motion in the cup the degree of chaoticity has been estimated . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an invariant chaotic liouville measure of about @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between this figure and the mixing parameter is due to the limited accuracy of the statistical analysis , caused by both , the fairly small number of 286 resonances and the rather poor desymmetrization of the microwave cavity . concerning the periodic orbits of the classical system we present a comparison with the length spectrum of the resonator and introduce a new bouncing ball formula for electromagnetic billiards .    2 </S>"
