    "ultracold atomic gases have proved to be remarkably interesting systems due to the extreme simplicity of their effective interactions , which can indeed be described in many cases by the mere knowledge of the scattering lengths between the involved atoms . in particular fermionic gases made of two kinds of atoms , usually two hyperfine states of a same atomic element ,",
    "have their interactions fully described by the scattering length @xmath5 between different atoms .",
    "a large number of studies have been devoted to the case of balanced systems where the numbers of the two different atoms are the same @xcite .",
    "more recently attention has also turned toward the case of imbalanced mixtures , where these atom numbers are unequal and which display very rich physics .",
    "they are analogous to systems found in other fields of physics , in particular superconductors in very high magnetic fields , but the ability to vary at will the ratio between the two atomic populations makes them especially convenient to explore experimentally .",
    "a particularly interesting situation is the limiting case where one atomic species is very dilute compared to the other one , so that its understanding reduces to the study of a single fermion in the fermi sea of the other population .",
    "we follow the fairly standard convention of calling this isolated atom a `` spin - down '' atom while the fermi sea is made of `` spin - up '' atoms and consider only the case where this interaction is attractive .",
    "this interaction between the spin - down and spin - up atoms `` polarizes '' the fermi sea and the resulting complex object , a quasiparticle , is quite often called a `` polaron '' .",
    "it is characterized by its binding energy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the chemical potential of the spin - down atom , and also by its effective mass @xmath8 which gives the kinetic energy @xmath9 when this quasiparticle has momentum @xmath10 .",
    "this polaron has been studied by various theoretical approaches @xcite , variational , diagrammatic and monte - carlo , which have been found in very good agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "the study of the polaron has been the basic step in the theoretical investigation by lobo _",
    "et al _ @xcite of the first order transition observed for trapped imbalanced fermi gases by the rice and the mit groups @xcite .",
    "their study has been performed at unitarity , but it has been extended later on to the whole bec - bcs crossover @xcite .",
    "they have evaluated the total energy of a normal gas of @xmath11 polarons in a fermi sea of @xmath12 atoms by taking into account not only the binding energy of these polarons , but also the kinetic energy of the polaron fermi sea , proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the spin - down concentration compared to the spin - up one .",
    "these two ingredients have proved essential to the analysis of experiments and the quite good agreement between experiments and theory .",
    "more generally the approach starting from the dilute limit for the spin - down population and leading for the total energy of the system to an expansion in powers for the spin - down density @xmath1 has proved to be extremely fruitful .",
    "our paper is in this line of reasoning .",
    "however monte - carlo calculations also performed by lobo _ et al _ @xcite showed a small and progressive departure for larger concentration @xmath1 from the energy just given by the sum of the polaron chemical potential and the kinetic energy of the polaron fermi sea .",
    "such a departure is naturally expected since , when the polaron concentration is increased , the dilute regime , where each polaron can be considered as isolated , breaks down and one has to consider the contribution coming from the interaction between polarons .",
    "once the properties of the isolated polaron is under control , this interaction between polarons is naturally the next problem of theoretical interest .",
    "but it is also of practical interest in order to have a better understanding of the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "this is the basic problem we will consider in the present paper .",
    "we note that nishida @xcite as well as patton and sheehy @xcite have investigated the quite interesting question of a possible instability coming from polaron interaction and leading to the p - wave superfluidity of the polaron gas",
    ". however we will restrict ourselves in this paper to the calculation of the total interaction and we will not proceed to an analysis of the partial wave components of the effective interaction .",
    "more precisely this analysis in terms of polarons is valid only in the dilute regime of small @xmath1 , strictly speaking in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "in this regime we can meaningfully expand the total energy of the system in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "the validity of this power expansion is only guaranteed for small @xmath1 , although one may hope , as it happens quite often , that it extends actually to fairly larger values of @xmath1 including for example the value @xmath14 where lobo _ et al _ have found a first order transition at unitarity .",
    "the binding energy of the polaron gives in the total energy a term proportional to @xmath1 and the kinetic energy of the polaron fermi sea is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "hence we are interested in terms with next higher power .",
    "these will turn out to be terms proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth noting that , although these exponents are indeed higher than the @xmath15 arising for the polaron fermi sea kinetic energy , the corresponding terms are in practice quite relevant for quantitative evaluations since , in order to neglect them , one would need to have typically @xmath16 which implies extremely small values of @xmath17 , that is much smaller than the typical values @xmath18 for which the first order transition has been found at unitarity .",
    "the most obvious physical origin of the interaction between two polarons is the overlap of the spin - up clouds surrounding the spin - down fermions , that is the overlap between the polarized regions forming the polarons .",
    "this makes each of these clouds less `` perfect '' than for an isolated polaron .",
    "this reduces the binding energy of each polaron , which implies a repulsive interaction between these polarons .",
    "however , in contrast with the naive expectation , the result for the total energy is not proportional to @xmath3 , but rather to @xmath4 .",
    "this is directly due to the fermi exclusion principle between polarons as we will see .",
    "indeed , qualitatively , this makes it impossible for two polarons to be in the same state , and depresses their probability to be spatially nearby , which decreases their overlap .",
    "apparently this argument leads to the surprising conclusion that there is no contribution proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "however this is clearly incorrect .",
    "indeed such a contribution arises because , when we calculate the chemical potential of a single polaron and want to have our result for the total energy correct up to order @xmath3 , we have to take into account that the fermi sea of the spin - up fermions is modified at first order in @xmath1 by the presence of the spin - down fermions , which gives rise to a correction of order @xmath1 to the chemical potential of the polarons in the dilute regime , and consequently a contribution of order @xmath3 for the overall energy .",
    "moreover , in order to obtain a proper expression of the polaron binding energy , we have also to take into account the modification of the spin - down properties , namely the existence of the polaron fermi sea , which is enough at the order we are working .",
    "one could expect that this last correction gives another contribution of order @xmath3 for the total energy , but it happens to be of order @xmath4 , that is of the same order as the term resulting from the overlap of the polarization clouds .    in the following",
    "we will calculate in turn these three above contributions .",
    "we will systematically stay at the simplest level of approximation , namely restricting the spin - up fermi sea excitations to single particle - hole excitations .",
    "this is first for simplicity since the involved calculations are already not so simple . on the other hand",
    "this is also justified by the fact that this approximation has proved to be excellent for the calculation of the polaron binding energy and for its effective mass @xcite , for reasons which are quite well understood @xcite .",
    "we may expect these same reasons to carry over into our problem , although we will not attempt to prove it .",
    "there is no difficulty in principle to go to the level of two particle - hole excitations or more within the framework we use , but in practice this would imply much more work . in the concluding",
    "part we will come back to the discussion of the power expansion and also compare our results to recent works by mora and chevy @xcite , and by yu , zllner and pethick @xcite who have adressed basically the same problem as the one we consider here .",
    "our purpose in this section is to calculate the first correction to the dilute limit , corresponding to the term with lowest power in @xmath1 related to the effect of the overlap between polarization clouds .",
    "we will proceed in the following way .",
    "we will first consider two polarons with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 and calculate their total energy .",
    "their interaction energy @xmath21 is the difference between this total energy and the sum of the energies of the isolated single polarons with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "then the contribution @xmath22 to the total interaction energy coming from the overlap is obtained by summing up over the free polaron fermi sea , with radius @xmath23 : @xmath24 with the factor @xmath25 to avoid double - counting .",
    "clearly this leaves out a number of effects which would lead to higher order corrections .",
    "for example the interaction energy of three polarons is not in general obtained by merely summing the three polaron - polaron interactions , there are specific three - body contributions .",
    "similarly we are allowed to consider the free polaron fermi sea only at lowest order , since in general the fermi sea itself will be modified by interactions .",
    "however taking into account such an effect would again lead to higher order terms in the expansion of the energy in powers of the density @xmath1 .    in order to perform the above program we will extend our preceding work @xcite , where we were dealing with a single spin - down interacting with a free spin - up fermi sea , to the case where we have two spin - down fermions . in principle",
    "we would like to write and solve the full corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "actually this full problem is much too difficult and we will restrict ourselves to a much simpler one by restricting as much as possible the hilbert space .",
    "in addition to the two spin - down fermions we allow only the presence of a single particle - hole excitation in the spin - up fermi sea .",
    "restricting in such a way the hilbert space is equivalent to perform a variational calculation .",
    "naturally the first justification for such a reduction of the hilbert space is simplicity .",
    "however we believe that we will nevertheless obtain a fairly good result for polaron interaction .",
    "indeed it has been shown that , for the single polaron problem , allowing a single particle - hole excitation provides an excellent result @xcite for the polaron chemical potential .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that the reasons behind the success of this approximation @xcite will also work for the case of two polarons .",
    "however we will not try to prove it because we would need to allow at least two particle - hole excitations which , although quite possible , is much more complicated than the calculation we will perform here .",
    "accordingly we consider for the two polarons an eigenstate of the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fermi sea of @xmath28-spins , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are annihilation and creation operators for @xmath28-spin atoms while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the corresponding operators for the @xmath33-spin atoms . in the following",
    "we assume implicitly @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "since the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 anticommute , the coefficient @xmath38 is naturally antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath39 implying the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "similarly in the second term , by anticommuting the two @xmath40 operators and making the appropriate change of variable , we conclude that : @xmath41 hence we have for example in the first term of eq.([wavef ] ) two identical terms describing a spin - down fermion with wavevector @xmath19 together with a spin - down fermion with wavevector @xmath20 . to correct for this redundancy",
    "we should put a factor @xmath25 in front of the eigenstate eq.([wavef ] ) .",
    "however since the normalisation of the wavefunction is unimportant in the following , it is simpler not to write this corrective coefficient .",
    "the hamiltonian of our problem is the standard one channel hamiltonian @xcite , widely used to investigate the single polaron problem , namely : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the kinetic energies ( we take @xmath45 throughout the paper ) . in the interaction energy term @xmath46 , the kronecker symbol insures momentum conservation .",
    "explicitly @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast with the single polaron case , where it is convenient to set the volume equal to unity , it is here necessary to write explicitly the volume @xmath48 in all the formulae .",
    "indeed when we let this volume go to infinity , we will have physically two independent polarons with a total energy equal to the sum of the energies of each polaron .",
    "if they have @xmath19 and @xmath20 as respective momenta , their energies are respectively @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the chemical potential and the effective mass of a single polaron @xcite , which depend naturally on the masses of the atoms , on the density @xmath53 of the spin - up atoms and on the scattering length @xmath5 . on the other hand if the volume @xmath48 is large but finite we expect , in addition to the preceding contributions to the total energy , an interaction energy which will scale as @xmath54 , since the typical volume of the polarization cloud of spin - up atoms surrounding a spin - down one is of order @xmath55 , which has to be compared to the sample volume @xmath48 .",
    "hence we have to consider a finite volume if we want , for the interaction energy we are interested in , to recover a nonzero result .",
    "this can be done in two equivalent procedures . a standard one is to introduce a factor @xmath56 in the right - hand side of the interaction term in eq.([hamilt ] ) .",
    "in this case the dimension of @xmath57 changes and , instead of being an energy , it becomes an energy multiplied by a volume .",
    "a completely equivalent , and for our purpose slightly more convenient , way is to keep eq.([hamilt ] ) unchanged so that @xmath57 has still the dimension of an energy . in this case",
    "the relation between the scattering length @xmath5 and the interaction @xmath57 has to be modified . for a unit volume",
    "this relation reads @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the reduced mass and @xmath60 is an upper cut - off in the interaction energy necessary to avoid ultraviolet divergences .",
    "as usual we will let this cut - off go to infinity while the coupling constant @xmath57 goes to zero , keeping the scattering length finite in the preceding relation .",
    "physically this corresponds to take the limit of a very short ranged interaction potential .",
    "however in the general case the dimensions of the preceding formula are incorrect and we have to write instead : @xmath61 where one sees that all the terms have the same dimension .",
    "this equation is clearly equivalent to the equation obtained by the first procedure ( which is merely obtained by dividing by @xmath48 and making the appropriate change of notation ) .",
    "it may also be checked in the situation where @xmath62 , in which case we have merely a scattering potential located at the center of a box of volume @xmath48 .",
    "this equation is convenient because nothing is changed compared to the case where the volume is unity , except that we have to make the single simple replacement @xmath63 .",
    "now , we write the schrdinger equation @xmath64 and project it on the subspace corresponding to eq.([wavef ] ) , i.e. onto the full fermi sea and the fermi sea with in addition a single particle - hole pair .",
    "this yields a set of two coupled equations .",
    "we will not write them for the general case , but rather take advantage of simplifications which were already arising in the case of a single polaron @xcite .",
    "first some terms , like the hartree term , disappear in the limit of vanishing interaction strength @xmath65 which we have to take , as we have explained above .",
    "naturally we will not write these terms .",
    "second the terms resulting from the scattering of an spin - up particle ( meaning with wavevector larger than @xmath66 ) display ultraviolet divergences analogous to the one present in the last term in the right - hand side of eq.([regular ] ) , linked to the fact that the wavevector can go to infinity .",
    "these will be precisely cured by making use of eq.([regular ] ) .",
    "on the other hand terms physically related to the scattering of holes ( which have wavevectors smaller than @xmath66 ) do naturally not present these ultraviolet divergences . hence in the above limit of @xmath67 they are negligible compared to the preceding ones . hence we will take only into account terms corresponding to the scattering of spin - up particles and will not write those corresponding to the scattering of holes , because in the end these last ones turn out indeed to be vanishing as can be checked by keeping them all the way long . with these simplifications we end up with : @xmath68= \\sum_{{\\bf k}{\\bf q}}\\left(\\alpha",
    "_ { { \\bf p}_1{\\bf",
    "p}_2{\\bf k}{\\bf q } } -\\alpha _ { { \\bf p}_2{\\bf",
    "p}_1{\\bf k}{\\bf q}}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath69 where we have set : @xmath70 ( we expect naturally @xmath71 ) .",
    "we note that the antisymmetry properties eq.([antialpp ] ) and eq.([antialppkq ] ) are automatically satisfied by these equations .",
    "this has been obtained by making use , when necessary , of the anticommutation property of the two @xmath40 operators .",
    "then we manipulate and simplify these equations in much the same way as we have done in the case of a single polaron @xcite .",
    "indeed the complication present here is the dependence of the wavefunction on the spin - down variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however the key part of the manipulation comes from the dependence on @xmath72 , in particular for large @xmath73 , and this aspect is essentially unchanged . indeed it is clear from eq.([eqapp ] ) that @xmath74 since the summation over the hole variable @xmath75 plays an unimportant role . dividing eq.([eqappkq ] ) by @xmath76 and summing over @xmath72 leads to : @xmath77 where we have introduced eq.([regular ] ) .",
    "the dominant contribution @xmath78 cancels out .",
    "then in the last parenthesis the first term @xmath79 is negligible compared to the last one @xmath80 in the limit @xmath81 .",
    "we are left with : @xmath82 where in the factor of @xmath38 , in the first term of the right - hand side , we have kept only the dominant term @xmath83 , the other ones being negligible in the limit @xmath81 . setting :",
    "@xmath84 which is finite in the limit @xmath81 , and with the notation : @xmath85^{-1 } \\equiv \\sum_{\\bf k}\\frac{1}{e^{(1)}_{{\\bf p}_1{\\bf p}_2{\\bf k}{\\bf q } } } + \\frac{{\\mathcal v}\\,m_r}{2\\pi a}- \\sum_{0}^{k_c } \\frac{2m_r}{k^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we end up with : @xmath86 if we look at the volume dependence of the various terms , we see from eq.([deft ] ) , after making the conversion from summation over @xmath72 to integration over @xmath72 by @xmath87 , that @xmath88^{-1}$ ] is proportional to volume @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to remark that this equation relates terms in the wave function corresponding to a fixed value of @xmath89 , which is natural since the total momentum is conserved in the scattering of the two spin - down particles . setting @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and similar notations for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we can rewrite eq.([eqf ] ) : @xmath96    for fixed @xmath97 and @xmath75 this is just a matrix relation between the vectors @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "making the change @xmath100 , we can write : @xmath101 where the matrix elements of @xmath102 are given by : @xmath103 and we have set : @xmath104 since : @xmath105 the @xmath102 matrix is symmetric : @xmath106 with our new notations eq.([eqapp ] ) reads : @xmath107{\\bar \\alpha } _",
    "{ \\bf p}({\\bf s } ) + \\sum_{{\\bf q}}\\left({\\bar f}_{\\bf q p}({\\bf s } ) -{\\bar f}_{\\bf q p}({\\bf -s})\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the two first terms @xmath108 represent the kinetic energy of the two spin - down particles written as the sum of the kinetic energy associated to the center of mass motion and the kinetic energy of the relative motion .",
    "inverting eq.([eqf2 ] ) and carrying it into eq.([eqapp1 ] ) we obtain : @xmath109{\\bar \\alpha } _ { \\bf p}({\\bf s } ) & = & \\frac{1}{{\\mathcal v}}\\,\\sum_{{\\bf q t}}\\left(a^{-1}_{{\\bf q}{\\bf p}}({\\bf s},{\\bf t})-a^{-1}_{{\\bf q}{\\bf p}}({\\bf -s},{\\bf t})\\right ) { \\bar \\alpha } _ { \\bf p}({\\bf t } ) \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\frac{1}{{\\mathcal v}}\\,\\sum_{{\\bf q t}}\\left(a^{-1}_{{\\bf q}{\\bf p}}({\\bf s},{\\bf t})+a^{-1}_{{\\bf",

    "we will now make use of the explicit expression eq.([ela ] ) for @xmath110 .",
    "we consider first the infinite volume limit where the second term in the right - hand side of eq.([ela ] ) is zero . in this case",
    "@xmath102 is diagonal and its inverse is : @xmath111 carrying this expression into eq.([eqapp2 ] ) and going to integration over @xmath75 we have : @xmath112{\\bar \\alpha } _ { \\bf p}({\\bf s } ) & = & \\frac{1}{{\\mathcal ( 2\\pi ) ^3}}\\ , \\int d{\\bf q}\\,\\left({\\bar t}_{\\bf q p}({\\bf s})+{\\bar t}_{\\bf q p}({\\bf -s})\\right ) { \\bar \\alpha } _ { \\bf p}({\\bf s})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or with our original notations ( with @xmath113 ) : @xmath114\\ , \\alpha _ { { \\bf p}_1{\\bf p}_2 }   & = & \\frac{1}{{\\mathcal ( 2\\pi ) ^3}}\\ , \\int d{\\bf q}\\,\\left(t_{\\bf q}({\\bf p}_1,{\\bf p}_2)+t_{\\bf q}({\\bf p}_2,{\\bf p}_1)\\right)\\,\\alpha _ { { \\bf p}_1{\\bf p}_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the volume has disappeared from the equation and at first this result looks like what is expected for the energy of two non - interacting polarons .",
    "indeed let us consider the first term in the right - hand side .",
    "it gives the chemical potential of the first polaron @xmath19 .",
    "indeed for this polaron the second polaron @xmath20 is irrelevant , and the relevant energy for this first polaron is @xmath115 , that is the total energy @xmath95 from which the kinetic energy @xmath116 of the second polaron has been removed .",
    "similarly one can check that this is also this difference @xmath115 which is entering @xmath117 through eq.([defe1 ] ) and eq.([deft ] ) . with the change in notations @xmath118 , one recovers for this polaron : @xmath119^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is exactly @xcite the implicit equation for @xmath95 which gives the single polaron chemical potential together with its effective mass .",
    "finally we can see in the same way the second term in the right - hand side of eq.([eqapp4 ] ) as giving the chemical potential of the isolated second polaron @xmath20 since , by exchanging the variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 and taking the antisymmetry eq.([antialpp ] ) of @xmath38 into account , it becomes the first term of the equation and we can repeat the above analysis .    actually the above argumentation",
    "is clearly not completely satisfactory since the analysis of the first polaron energy implies that @xmath120 while the second one corresponds rather to @xmath121 . since in general @xmath122 , these two values are inconsistent .",
    "we might perhaps argue that , since we are anyway interested in small values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 , we should neglect kinetic energies and only the zeroth order result @xmath125 is relevant .",
    "however even in this case we see that the sum of the two contributions in the right - hand side of eq.([eqapp4 ] ) gives @xmath126 instead of @xmath127 , so that this equation is actually not satisfied .",
    "the reasons for these problems are physically quite clear . since we have taken the very strong restriction eq.([wavef ] ) for the hilbert space",
    ", we do not even allow the situation where each one of the polarons has its own single particle - hole dressing .",
    "although it is not in general meaningful to attach the particle - hole pair to a specific spin - down particle , we may roughly say that when one spin - down particle is dressed by the particle - hole pair , giving it the energy @xmath127 ( for zero kinetic energy ) , the other spin - down particle is naked and its energy is just its kinetic energy . in this perspective",
    "the expressions written in the above paragraph for the total energy @xmath95 become quite meaningful .    a tempting way to solve the preceding inconsistencies is to enlarge our hilbert space by allowing the existence of two particle - hole pairs . in this case",
    "we would have the possibility to have each spin - down particle dressed by one particle - hole pair , allowing a much more satisfactory physical description of the two polarons . however",
    "this would not solve all the consistency problems since we would have the possibility that one down - particle is dressed by two particle - hole pairs while the other down - particle is naked .",
    "this would be a situation analogous to the one we are faced with , although it would clearly be much more complicated since we should treat the single polaron problem at the level of two particle - hole pairs .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to check that , if we allow each spin - down particle to have a single particle - hole pair dressing , the above inconsistencies disappear .",
    "indeed we can consider the case where the two spin - down particles belong to different systems , each spin - down particle polarizing a different fermi sea .",
    "hence one has two non - interacting systems .",
    "physically this is not so different from the case of two polarons in an infinite volume , since the overlap between the two polarons will also be zero in this last case .",
    "the state describing this situation is merely the tensorial product of the two polarons ( each one having its single particle - hole pair dressing ) .",
    "hence there is the possibility to have two particle - hole pairs .",
    "one can then write the corresponding schrdinger equation , which decouples naturally into two schrdinger equations , describing the two independent systems .",
    "hence one can follow how the existence of the additional term with two particle - hole pairs solves the above inconsistencies and allows the decoupling of the equations , leading to the obvious result that the total energy is the sum of the energies of each polaron , each one being obtained by solving eq.([eqapp5 ] ) . since writing all this",
    "explicitly does not make any problem , but is fairly lengthy and burdensome , the reading being uninspiring , with a result which is completely obvious physically , we will not display the corresponding equations and stay at the level of this physical discussion .",
    "our final conclusion is that , since at this stage everything reduces to the calculation of the energy of a single polaron , the energy @xmath95 which comes in the expression of @xmath117 , through eq.([defe1 ] ) and eq.([deft ] ) , is the single polaron energy , i.e. the polaron chemical potential @xmath127 when we work at zeroth order in kinetic energies .    as a final remark",
    "we note that all the problems discussed above are hidden in the case of the weak coupling limit , where @xmath128 and each term in the right - hand side of eq.([eqapp4 ] ) gives merely a ( mean - field ) contribution @xmath129 .",
    "let us now consider the case of a finite volume @xmath48 . in this case the second term in eq.([ela ] ) is no longer zero .",

    "accordingly the formula giving @xmath7 in terms of @xmath12 , i.e. in terms of @xmath292 , is unchanged in this weak coupling regime , and we should not find any correction .    indeed in this case",
    "we have @xcite @xmath331 and @xmath332 in agreement with eq.([mdmu ] ) , as it should be , since from eq.([eqz ] ) , we have @xmath333 , the correction being of second order in @xmath261 , i.e. in @xmath334 . in eq.([deltnup2 ] ) , the first term , which is of order @xmath334 , is negligible compared to the second one of order @xmath5 , leading to @xmath335 . hence the second term in the right - hand side of eq.([gdcan ] ) is @xmath336 . on the other hand the first and third terms in the right - hand side of eq.([deltmudgdcan ] ) are proportional to @xmath337 , i.e. to @xmath338 .",
    "hence in the weak coupling limit they are negligible compared to the second one which is proportional to @xmath339 .",
    "again we have only to take in this term the derivative of the heaviside function and we find in this limit @xmath340 . as a result , when we carry this value into eq.([gdcan ] ) , we find that @xmath341 , which is formally of order @xmath334 in our calculation , is actually exactly zero , as it should be .",
    "similar simplifications are also present in the general case , and we can write the final result explicitly as : @xmath342 ^ 2 } -\\sum_{\\bf q q'}\\frac{\\gamma^2_0({\\bf q},\\omega _ { \\bf q } ) \\gamma_0({\\bf q'},\\omega _ { \\bf q'})}{[e^{(1)}_{{\\bf q'}{\\bf q}}]^2 } -2 \\sum_{\\bf k q}\\frac{\\gamma^3_0({\\bf q},\\omega _ { \\bf q})}{[e^{(1)}_{{\\bf k}{\\bf q}}]^2 } \\\\ \\nonumber & -&\\sum_{\\bf k q q ' } \\frac{\\gamma^2_0({\\bf q},\\omega _ { \\bf q})\\gamma_0 ^ 2({\\bf q'},\\omega _ { \\bf q'})}{e^{(1)}_{{\\bf q'}{\\bf q}}[e^{(1)}_{{\\bf k}{\\bf q'}}]^2 } + \\gamma_0(k_f,0)\\sum_{\\bf k q}\\frac{\\gamma^2_0({\\bf q},\\omega _ { \\bf q})}{[e^{(1)}_{{\\bf k}{\\bf q}}]^2 }   + \\sum_{\\bf k q q'}\\frac{\\gamma^2_0({\\bf",
    "q},\\omega _ { \\bf q})\\gamma_0 ^ 2({\\bf q'},\\omega _ { \\bf q'})}{[e^{(1)}_{{\\bf k}{\\bf q}}]^2}\\langle\\frac{1}{e^{(1)}_{{\\bf k_f}{\\bf q'}}}\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used our implicit notations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath343 , while @xmath10 runs over all possible values of the wavevector .",
    "we have set @xmath344 , and @xmath345 . finally ,",
    "in the last term , the brackets denote the angular average on the direction of @xmath72 running on the fermi surface @xmath346 , which is easily performed analytically .",
    "note that the apparent singularities in the first two terms , which would occur for @xmath347 , are actually not present because the numerators of these first two terms cancel at the same place .",
    "once the right - hand side of eq.([eqzmn ] ) is evaluated , the corresponding contribution @xmath348 to the interaction energy is given by : @xmath349 the coefficient in front of @xmath350 in eq.([eint3 ] ) is plotted in fig.[fig3 ] for equal masses @xmath172 .",
    "it is worth noting that the result is positive , a result expected physically but by no means obvious from the explicit expression eq.([eqzmn ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the result is quantitatively fairly small .",
    "for example at unitarity the coefficient is 0.041 .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that the result goes very rapidly to zero in the weak coupling limit since we have seen that it behaves as @xmath338 in this limit .",
    "( color online ) @xmath351 as a function of @xmath171 in the case of equal masses @xmath172 . ]",
    "in the preceding sections we have calculated contributions to the expansion in powers of the density @xmath1 of the total system energy . they correspond to the @xmath3 term and the @xmath4 term in this expansion .",
    "we note that this expansion is not restricted to integral powers @xmath352 as one would expect classically , but rather to integral powers @xmath353 of @xmath354 , that is we have actually an expansion in integral powers of the polaron fermi sea radius @xmath23 .",
    "naturally a few terms are missing at the beginning of this expansion and the first terms are the @xmath1 term , coming from the polaron binding energy , and the @xmath2 term , coming from the polaron kinetic energy . we have found terms proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and it is quite likely that all the higher powers of @xmath354 have nonzero coefficients .",
    "for example the polaron effective mass depends also on the polaron density , and we expect the first correction to the @xmath355 result to be proportional to @xmath1 ( presumably corresponding to a decrease of the effective mass ) .",
    "this will lead to a @xmath356 term ( presumably with a positive coefficient ) .",
    "it should be noted that we have not proceeded to a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath1 within a single coherent framework .",
    "proceeding in such a way would require a diagrammatic analysis .",
    "this is certainly a desirable goal , but unfortunately this looks fairly complicated to perform effectively . our position has rather been to start from a physical point of view , and then to calculate each contribution in the more convenient way , either by the simple hamiltonian approach or diagrammatically . nevertheless it is clear that , in such a diagrammatic analysis , the term calculated in section [ polarfermup ] will appear as a polaron - polaron interaction term mediated by the spin - up fermi sea ( while the one calculated in section [ polarferm ] is just a direct manifestation of the polaron fermi sea ) .",
    "our lack of systematic expansion leaves open in principle the possibility that , up to the order we have considered , some terms are missing , although we believe that this is quite unlikely .",
    "we can now gather our results to get the total energy @xmath357 out of our results .",
    "we have to add to our interaction energy terms the energy of the free spin - up fermi sea , the contribution from the chemical potential of isolated polarons and the kinetic energy of the non interacting polaron fermi sea @xcite .",
    "focusing on the specific case of unitarity as in ref.@xcite , we have : @xmath358 where the polaron binding energy and effective mass are taken from @xcite .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and it is in clear disagreement with the monte - carlo results and the analytical curve of ref.@xcite as soon as @xmath359 .",
    "naturally in this range it is reasonable to believe the numbers given by monte - carlo calculations since they take full account of all the effects coming from the polaron finite density ( although they work with a small number of particles while in contrast our calculations are in the thermodynamical limit ) .",
    "( color online ) total reduced energy @xmath360 at unitarity as a function of the relative spin - down population @xmath361 ( note that in ref.@xcite this is @xmath362 which is plotted ) . the ( blue ) thick dashed line is the expansion in powers of @xmath1 limited to the @xmath2 term with the coefficients from ref.@xcite , i.e. the three first terms of eq.([toten ] ) .",
    "the ( red ) full line is this expansion going now up to the @xmath4 term , i.e. our full result eq.([toten ] ) .",
    "the ( black ) dotted - dashed line is the same expansion , but omitting the dominant contribution coming from @xmath22 , and retaining only @xmath235 and @xmath348 .",
    "the ( green ) thin dashed line is the phenomenological formula eq.([phen ] ) with @xmath363 .",
    "the blue dots are the monte - carlo results from ref.@xcite . ]    the most natural way to understand this discrepancy is to remark that there is no reason to believe that , in our powers expansion , terms of higher order than the ones we have considered ( i.e. going beyond @xmath4 ) do not contribute in a very important way .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the contribution from @xmath22 is quite important .",
    "this finding implies that the series is not rapidly converging and that accordingly terms beyond this one give also an important contribution . actually , at the start of the calculation ,",
    "the only hope of agreement between our expansion and monte - carlo results was to find the opposite situation , that is all the terms we would find would be small .",
    "this would imply a rapidly converging series expansion which could be stopped at the order we have reached .",
    "nevertheless this would have meant that polarons are weakly interacting objects , which is hard to understand physically since obviously the polarization cloud is easily perturbed .",
    "hence , although our result is disappointing for quantitative agreement , it is quite reasonable physically . in this respect",
    "we note that , in ref.@xcite , the reasonable agreement between monte - carlo results and the analytical result corresponding to the first three terms in eq.([toten ] ) was to a large extent due to the use of the value @xmath364 ( obtained from monte - carlo calculations ) for the polaron effective mass .",
    "surprisingly the result is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath8 , and making use of @xmath365 leads to an analytical result fairly different from the monte - carlo results .",
    "this sizeable difference can quite naturally be interpreted as the important overall effect of the interaction between polarons .",
    "we note incidentally that , if we omit the dominant interaction contribution @xmath22 , and retain only @xmath235 and @xmath348 , we obtain a result in very good agreement with monte - carlo calculations as it can be seen on fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "there is naturally another possible source for the discrepancy we have found .",
    "our calculation of the various coefficients is only approximate since we have stayed within the single particle - hole approximation .",
    "for the calculation of the polaron binding energy and effective mass , this approximation has proved to be remarkably accurate because taking more particle - hole excitations leads to a series which converges extremely rapidly toward the exact result @xcite .",
    "it is likely that a similar conclusion applies for the coefficients we have calculated .",
    "this was our reason , in addition to simplicity , to stay at this level of approximation .",
    "however there is no good reason to believe that , if convergence there is , it is as fast as for the binding energy .",
    "the effective mass displays already a somewhat slower convergence .",
    "hence it is quite possible that the convergence is not as fast for our coefficients .",
    "in particular we have noticed , when calculating @xmath22 , that keeping only a single particle - hole excitation was leading to quite inconvenient situations . even if we have found our way around these problems",
    ", it seems likely they indicate that the single particle - hole approximation is not so accurate . hence it is quite possible that the exact results for the power expansion coefficients are somewhat away from our findings .",
    "nevertheless we believe it is quite unlikely that the corresponding changes reduce the interaction effects to such an extent that the polaron - polaron interaction could be considered as small enough to be neglected .",
    "we consider now the work of mora and chevy @xcite in the light of our results .",
    "first of all they have neglected the direct interaction term we have calculated in section [ polar ] since it is a @xmath4 term , which is a coherent point of view .",
    "nevertheless , as we have stressed , this term becomes negligible only for very small @xmath1 , in a range which is below the one involved in experiments or in monte - carlo calculations .",
    "we are then left with the @xmath3 term . here",
    "we identify the term they have found with the term , imposed by thermodynamics , to go from the grand canonical to the canonical ensemble , i.e. the second term in the right - hand side of eq.([gdcan ] ) .",
    "indeed , just as in eq.([eint3 ] ) , this term gives to the total energy a contribution : @xmath366 since , as we have seen , thermodynamics implies @xmath367 , and @xmath368 , we obtain : @xmath369\\,\\frac{5}{9}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu { _ { \\downarrow}}}{\\partial \\mu { _ { \\uparrow}}}\\right)^2_{n   { _ { \\downarrow}}}\\,x^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is just their result for the interaction term .",
    "this is coherent with their assumption that in the grand canonical ensemble , one has a mixture of two ideal fermi gases of polarons and majority atoms , which means that there is no term describing their interaction .",
    "hence in the canonical ensemble only the term required by thermodynamics appears .",
    "by contrast we have found a contribution in the grand canonical ensemble , namely the first term in eq.([gdcan ] ) , and in the weak coupling limit @xmath370 we find an overall result which behaves like @xmath338 in contrast with their @xmath334 behaviour .",
    "finally they ascribe their result to the effect of pauli blocking by the polaron fermi sea which they find behaving as @xmath3 .",
    "it is tempting to identify this effect with the one we have calculated in section [ polarferm ] , but we have found a @xmath4 behaviour which is negligible in their framework .",
    "finally we have mentioned that our @xmath3 term can be seen as an indirect interaction between spin - down atoms mediated by the spin - up fermi sea .",
    "this is in agreement with the interpretation proposed by yu , zllner and pethick @xcite .",
    "however our microscopic result eq.([eqzmn ] ) is much more complex than the one they propose within fermi liquid theory .",
    "this might be due to the fact that , in this way , they restrict themselves to indirect interaction through low frequency perturbations , while we have not assumed such a restriction . it is also puzzling that they end up with the result obtained by mora and chevy , while we have seen that it has a purely thermodynamical interpretation .",
    "finally it is interesting to present a simple phenomenological model which displays explicitly the troubles one meets when trying to perform a power expansion . in this model",
    "we treat at first symmetrically the spin - up and spin - down atoms .",
    "first there is the standard kinetic energy associated with the respective fermi seas .",
    "concentrating on the unitary case ( and assuming also equal masses ) , we can in a simple phenomenology disregard the difference between the polaron effective mass and the bare mass . introducing the total density @xmath371 and the associated fermi energy @xmath372 ,",
    "the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fermi seas is @xmath373 where @xmath374 and @xmath375 ( and @xmath376 ) . with respect to the polaron binding energy we know its value for @xmath286 ( or @xmath377 ) .",
    "however the effective binding energy decreases when @xmath11 increases because the polarization of the spin - up fermi sea has to be shared between all the spin - down atoms ( this is another way to see the polaron - polaron interaction ) . on the other hand",
    "this binding energy will clearly be zero when @xmath378 since there is no spin - up fermi sea anymore .",
    "phenomenologically we may choose an interpolating function between these two limits , and write for example the interaction energy as @xmath379 with @xmath380 , allowing for one fitting parameter @xmath381 .",
    "writing the corresponding expression for the spin - up polarons , we end up with the following expression for the total energy @xmath357 @xmath382 the corresponding expression for @xmath383 in terms of @xmath0 is obtained by dividing the above expression by @xmath384 , and using @xmath385 and @xmath386 .",
    "this leads to : @xmath387 it turns out that @xmath363 gives a very good fit to the monte - carlo results as it can be seen from fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "on the other hand since the radius of convergence for the series expansion of @xmath388 in powers of @xmath1 is 1 , the expansion of @xmath357 in powers of @xmath1 diverges for @xmath389 .",
    "hence there is no way with a power expansion to have an agreement with monte - carlo results for @xmath389 .",
    "and accordingly this cast some doubts on the possibility to get good results for lower values of @xmath1 by making a series expansion and retaining a fairly large number of terms .",
