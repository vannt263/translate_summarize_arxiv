    "given that most galaxies harbor supermassive black holes at their centers ( richstone et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , and that galaxy mergers are common , binary black holes should likewise be common .",
    "an understanding of the evolution and formation of these systems is important for an understanding of the evolution and formation of galaxies in general ( silk @xmath6 rees 1998 , merritt 2006 ) .",
    "theoretical descriptions of supermassive binary black hole systems and their accretion disks have been investigated by hayasaki et al .",

    "our ability to resolve the supermassive black holes in any given binary system depends on the separation between them , on their distance from earth , and on the resolving power of the telescope used .",
    "it is believed that the longest timescale in the evolution of a supermassive binary black hole system leading up to coalescence is the stage in which the system is closely bound ( @xmath7 0.1 - 10 pc ) , meaning that in most of these systems the black hole pair can only be resolved by vlbi observations ( in the case where both black holes are radio loud ) which provides resolutions of milliarcseconds and finer .",
    "this could explain why very few such systems have been found ( see review by @xcite detailing observational evidence for supermassive black hole binaries ) .",
    "some source properties like x - shaped radio galaxies and double - double radio galaxies , helical radio - jets , double - horned emission line profiles , and semi - periodic variations in lightcurves have been taken as indirect evidence for compact binary black holes though other explanations are possible .",
    "some wider systems have , however , been found more directly .",
    "for example , the ultra luminous galaxy ngc 6240 , discovered by the chandra x - ray observatory , was found to have a pair of active supermassive black holes at its center @xcite , separated by a distance of 1.4 kpc .",
    "another system that has been known for some time is the double agn ( 7 kpc separation ) constituting the radio source 3c 75 , which was discovered by the vla to have two pairs of radio jets @xcite .    the radio galaxy 0402 + 379 was recently found to contain two central , compact , flat spectrum , variable components ( designated c1 and c2 ) , with a projected separation of 7.3 pc , a feature which had not been observed in any other compact source , making this system the most compact supermassive binary black hole pair yet imaged by more than two orders of magnitude , with an estimated system mass of a few @xmath8 @xmath4 ( maness et al .",

    "the contours are taken from the 2007 global vlbi observations at 1.3 ghz and the color scale from the 2005 vlba observations at 5 ghz .",
    "two absorption lines are evident , which appear to be at two different locations toward the southern jet . from this point on we will designate cw the western component , where we see the stronger line ; and ce the eastern component , where we see the weaker line .",
    "measurements of these lines are given in table [ gaussians ] , where we also show the peak opacity and the column density for both components , which we calculated according to , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spin temperature , @xmath15 is the velocity resolution , and the summation is over the channels where we detect absorption for cw and ce respectively .",
    "we determined the central velocity of the hi absorption lines to be 16,927 @xmath0 7 km s@xmath1 and 15,856 @xmath0 9 km s@xmath1 for cw and ce respectively .",
    "from the most recent reported redshift for 0402 + 379 , as measured from optical emission lines @xcite , we find that the observed line for cw is redshifted by 370 @xmath0 10 km s@xmath1 and for ce is blueshifted by 700 @xmath0 10 km s@xmath1 from the systemic velocity of the source ( 16,558 @xmath0 3 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "no absorption was found at either c1 or c2 ( see figure [ spectra ] ) .",
    "we calculate a limit on the hi opacity at the location of c1 and c2 , and obtain @xmath16 0.17 and @xmath16 0.03 repectively .",
    "figure [ central+width ] shows a map of both the central velocity and width of the hi absorption profiles over the source .",
    "figure [ opacity ] shows a velocity slice of the continuum - subtracted cube ( right panel ) , accompanied by the hi opacity distribution over the source ( left panel ) .",
    "this result shows that either the two locations where we find absorption are localized regions , rather than being part of a more extended and perhaps homogeneous structure , or our sensitivity prevented us from detecting hi absorption over a broader region . in order to explore this question we calculated the lower limit on the peak opacity across the source assuming an intensity for the line of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the rms noise in a single channel .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ opacitypeak ] .",
    "we see that outside the region where we detect absorption ( compare with figure [ opacity ] ) we would need a peak opacity of at least @xmath19 , comparable to the peak opacity found for components ce and cw , in order to have a @xmath17 detection .",
    "the fact that we did not detect this means that the peak opacity in this region is even smaller than the lower limit found , suggesting that what we are observing are two different , localized clumps , rather than a more extended and homogeneous structure .",
    "the fact that we do not see absorption against c2 supports this scenario .",
    "we can estimate the hi mass of the clumps from the calculated column densities ( table [ gaussians ] ) and assuming a spherical shape , according to the following relation ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the hydrogen atom mass and @xmath22 is the radius of the clump estimated from the opacity distribution map shown in figure [ opacity ] .",
    "for cw we used @xmath23 pc and for ce @xmath24 pc .",
    "we find a mass ranging from @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath4 for component cw , and @xmath28 @xmath26 @xmath29 for component ce , assuming spin temperatures ranging from 100 k to 6000 k. these masses are bigger than typical values of hi cloud masses of @xmath30 @xmath4 found in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the results found from our 2007 global vlbi observations at 1.3 ghz show two hi absorption lines , one blueshifted and the other redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity . the redshifted line ( component cw ) shows a fwhm of 300 @xmath0 20 km s@xmath1 , and the blueshifted line ( component ce ) a fwhm of 170 @xmath0 20 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this absorption must be from neutral hydrogen along the line - of - sight to the central continuum source , but this gas could be close to the nucleus or far away ; could be falling in , outflowing , or in rotation .    assuming a virialized cloud of @xmath31 @xmath4 and a radius of 5 pc we get , from the virial theorem , a velocity for the h atoms of @xmath32 km s@xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , if we use the high end temperature of @xmath33 k the thermal speed of an h atom is @xmath34 km s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , under these assumptions , at most @xmath35 km s@xmath1 of the line widths observed for both ce and cw could be accounted for , leaving a considerable balance which could be attributed to the proximity of these components to the central parsecs of the source , where the gravitational potential well is deepest .",
    "another possibility is that the broad line widths and large velocities for one or both components are due to a jet - cloud interaction .",
    "@xcite studied the seyfert 2 galaxy ic 5063 , where a strong interaction between the radio jet and a molecular cloud of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is ocurring at the position of the western radio lobe of the source .",
    "the most prominent absorption feature found is blueshifted over 600 km s@xmath1 with respect to the systemic velocity , a value that lies outside the range allowed by rotational kinematics of the large - scale hi disk .",
    "as an effect of the outflow produced by the interaction as well as the geometry of the source , there will be components moving both away and towards the observer . since only absorption in those components in front of the radio continuum",
    "can be observed , the blueshifted component was the only one detected .",
    "returning to our case , it is very unlikely that the motion found in both components , cw ( redshifted component ) and ce ( blueshifted component ) , which are only a few parsecs apart , is due to jet - cloud interactions , since this would require a dramatic change in the way the southern jet is moving , on scales of only a few parsecs .",
    "we consider that both cw and ce are part of the same rotating disk structure , of which we only see a couple of clumps , and for the remainder of the discussion , we assume that this is the case and propose a model that reproduces the observations . we also assume that the mass of component c1 is significantly smaller than that of component c2 , thus not affecting the stability of the disk .",
    "this type of binary , where the two black holes have different masses , are thought to occur more frequently , since minor galactic mergers are more common than major mergers in hierarchical models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "we realize that in a thin disk the binary would likely clear out all material within twice the radius of the binary @xcite , but perhaps this process is less efficient for a thick disk , or material is resupplied .",
    "if we assume that components cw and ce are rotating about c2 in circular keplerian orbits lying on the same plane , the only way of reproducing the measured velocities ( according to our proposed model , explained below ) is by requiring a very high central mass , of at least @xmath36 , in disagreement with previous estimates @xcite as well as typical supermassive black hole masses .",
    "thus , we propose a model consisting of a geometrically thick disk , rather than a geometrically thin disk , rotating in a keplerian circular orbit , which can be part of a larger scale torus , that can reproduce the velocities that we observe from the hi absorption , at the measured locations .",
    "we assume that cw and ce are rotating in parallel planes , both offset from the plane in which c2 lies .",
    "the distances between these planes are free parameters in our model .",
    "we call @xmath37 the separation between c2 and the center of the circular orbit 1 , that ce is following ; and @xmath38 the separation between c2 and the center of the circular orbit 2 , that cw is following .",
    "figure [ cartoon ] is a cartoon showing the configuration of the model we are proposing .",
    "we assume that the rotation axis crosses component c2 , which is at the systemic velocity of 16,558 @xmath0 3 km s@xmath1 @xcite , a natural assumption considering that the jets of this source seem to be emerging from c2 , not from c1 . also , we suggest that the two absorption lines that are observed could be explained by the presence of two mass clumps , both part of a clumpy geometrically thick disk structure ( an idea that is supported by the opacity distribution map obtained , figure [ opacity ] ) .",
    "we let @xmath37 and @xmath38 vary over a range of values and calculate , for each different combination ( @xmath37,@xmath38 ) what the orientation in space of the thick disk should be in order to best reproduce the observed velocities , via a minimization routine . after obtaining the inclination of the thick disk for each pair ( @xmath37,@xmath38 ) ,",
    "we again apply a minimization routine in order to find the combination ( @xmath37,@xmath38 ) that best reproduces the measured velocities .",
    "this same procedure was applied with different values of the central mass , which allowed us to set a lower limit on this quantity of @xmath39 @xmath4 ( by requiring that the difference between the velocities predicted by the model and the observed velocities was smaller than 1@xmath18 ) . see appendix [ diskappendix ] for more details on the model .",
    "there is no upper limit on the mass that we can find using this model , since for greater masses we can always find an inclination that reproduces very accurately the measured values ( the inclination angle , with respect to the line of sight , decreases as we increase the central mass ) .",
    "@xcite made an estimate of the central mass of 0402 + 379 , based on an optical spectrum of the core of this radio galaxy taken with the hobby - eberly telescope , which shows a red shoulder suggesting two components with a velocity separation of @xmath7300 km s@xmath1 . at the observed",
    "projected separation between the nuclei of 7.3 pc , an orbital velocity of 300 km s@xmath1 implies a system mass of @xmath40 @xmath4 . for this particular value of the central mass",
    ", our model gives an inclination of the rotation axis of @xmath41 with respect to the line of sight , thus requiring the source to be very close to the plane of the sky .",
    "a value for @xmath38 of @xmath5 pc is obtained , which sets a lower limit on the scale height of the thick disk .",
    "this value is consistent with observed parameters of supposed tori ( see for example peck et al . 1999 , where a 20 pc scale height torus is estimated for the radio source 1946 + 708 ) .    considering the size of our synthesized beam and the extension of the two regions where",
    "absorption is observed , we were not able to measure a significant velocity gradient within cw or ce .",
    "the small variations in velocity found are not reproduced by our model . however",
    ", other factors could influence these mass concentrations that we are not taken into account in our model , such as proper motions associated with each clump .      assuming that c2 is the origin of the radio emission on parsec scales",
    ", we can constrain the orientation of 0402 + 379 . in the simple beaming model for simultaneously ejected jet components moving in opposite directions , the arm length ratio @xmath42 depends on the intrinsic speed @xmath43 and the angle of the twin jets to the line of sight @xmath44 . the arm length ratio ,",
    "@xmath45 , is given by    @xmath46    where the apparent projected distances from c2 ( assumed to be the origin of radio emission ) are @xmath47 for the northern jet ( approaching side ) and @xmath48 for the southern jet ( receding side ) . from this",
    "we get @xmath49 @xcite , a result that implies that the intrinsic velocity must be at least 0.4c and @xmath50 must be less than @xmath51 .",
    "based on the observed morphology of the source , we can assume a minimum value for @xmath44 of @xmath52 . according to our proposed model",
    "( see  [ rotatingdisk ] ) these constraints on the inclination set a lower limit on the central mass of the system of @xmath53 @xmath4 , for @xmath2 .",
    "angles as small as @xmath52 are allowed , however , they require a very large mass ( @xmath54 @xmath4 ) .    figure [ cartoon7e8msun ] is a cartoon showing the results obtained by our model for a central mass of @xmath55 @xmath4 ( @xmath2 ) , overlaid with 5 ghz contours of 0402 + 379 from the 2005 vlba observations .",
    "we can see that the rotation axis aligns very well , within @xmath56 , with the jet axis , which was not a constraint imposed by the model .",
    "if we asume that the center of the orbit that c1 follows is located at the position of c2 , and also that component c2 is significantly more massive than c1 , we obtain an orbital velocity for c1 of @xmath57 km s@xmath1 ( for a mass of @xmath55 @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the current limit from vlbi monitoring of @xmath58 km s@xmath1 .",
    "global vlbi observations at 1.3 ghz were performed on the radio galaxy 0402 + 379 , the most compact supermassive binary black hole pair yet imaged .",
    "two absorption lines were found toward the southern jet of the source , one redshifted by 370 @xmath0 10 km s@xmath1 and the other blueshifted by 700 @xmath0 10 km s@xmath1 with respect to the systemic velocity of the source .",
    "a model consisting of a thick disk , of which we only see a couple of clumps , was devoloped in order to reproduce the velocities measured from the hi absorption profiles .",
    "these clumps , components cw and ce , rotate in circular keplerian orbits around an axis that crosses one of the supermassive black holes of the binary system in 0402 + 379 , component c2 .",
    "we found an upper limit for the inclination angle of the twin jets to the line of sight of @xmath2 , which , according to the proposed model , implies a lower limit on the central mass of @xmath3 @xmath4 and a lower limit for the scale height of the thick disk of @xmath5 pc .",
