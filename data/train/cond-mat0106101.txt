    "when @xmath122 is attractive at short distances , @xmath121 is negative .",
    "the possibility of instability then depends only on the precise behaviour of the dimensionless fourier transform @xmath116 . for very short ranged potentials ,",
    "@xmath123 is expected to be positive for all @xmath124 .",
    "the instability condition can then be rewritten in a more transparent form : @xmath125 if , in addition , @xmath116 is a monotonous decreasing function , instability occurs at large wavelengths provided the temperature is low enough .",
    "more precisely , provided that @xmath126 is finite ( short - range potential ) , one can define a critical temperature @xmath1 : @xmath127 for @xmath128 , there exists a finite interval @xmath129 $ ] in which the uniform state in unstable .",
    "@xmath130 is a function of the density @xmath104 and the temperature . assuming that @xmath126 is of order unity , ( [ tc ] )",
    "means that the critical temperature is such that the thermal energy is of the order of the effective interaction energy .",
    "the existence of an upper @xmath130 , below which the uniform solution is unstable is easily understood on physical grounds . for a small disturbance having a large wavelength compared to the range of the potential ,",
    "particles in excess tend to attract each other more firmly , increasing holes in the density . on the other hand ,",
    "when the wavelength is quite small , the inhomogenities are easily washed out since holes and particles all interact .    as an example , let us consider the @xmath114-dimensional gaussian attractive potential : @xmath131 in this case , one has : @xmath132 and @xmath130 is given by : @xmath133 which entails that : @xmath134 these last results are depicted in the left part of fig .",
    "[ qinstcren ] .",
    "the same conclusions still qualitatively hold if a repulsive core is added ( _ e . g.",
    "_ 6 - 12 lennard - jones or morse potential ) .",
    "this only affects the large-@xmath135 behaviour of @xmath136 and does not change the results .",
    "when the potential has a sharp cut - off , its fourier transform has an oscillatory behaviour at relatively small wave numbers and an interesting phenomenon occurs . to be specific ,",
    "let us take the following square potential : @xmath137",
    "we here find @xmath138 . now , let us note @xmath139 the _ absciss _ of the maxima of @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) . then , for @xmath144 , a single instability interval arises , @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath146 decreases , another interval @xmath147 $ ] is found when @xmath148 , and so on .",
    "the situation is depicted on fig .",
    "[ qinstcren ] .",
    "thus , for a short - range potential with a sharp cut - off , several disjoint instability intervals are successively obtained when the temperature is decreased .",
    "if @xmath126 is infinite , @xmath1 is formally also infinite ; this means that the uniform solution is unstable at small @xmath135 for _ any _ temperature ( see fig . [ qinstmoinv ] , left ) .",
    "for instance , for the one - dimensional coulomb potential ( [ coul1d ] ) , one has ( after regularization ) @xmath149 , so that : @xmath150 the same holds true for higher dimensions , since @xmath123 is for any @xmath114 proportional to @xmath151 .    in the preceding examples , the first instability interval ,",
    "when it exists , arises around @xmath152 .",
    "this is , as explained above , a physical consequence of the fact that the potential is purely attractive ( the fact that @xmath1 is finite or not is a consequence of the range only ) .",
    "another interesting situation is when @xmath122 is attractive at short distance and repulsive at long distance ; this means that two particles are bound by a potential barrier but can dissociate when one of them is given enough energy .",
    "as an example , let us consider the _ inverted _ 3@xmath114 morse potential : @xmath153       \\enspace,\\hspace{20pt }       v_{0}\\,<\\,0      \\enspace.\\label{morse}\\ ] ] in such a case , @xmath1 is again finite , and the instability interval for @xmath135 is of the form @xmath154 $ ] ; it grows around a finite value ( which gives @xmath155 its secondary minimum ) and is a consequence , at intermediate wavelengths , of the interplay between attraction at short distances and repulsion at large ones .",
    "this instability domain is schematized in figure [ qinstmoinv ] .",
    "quite naturally , the uniform state is stable against long wavelength deformations ( due to the long distance repulsive behaviour of the potential ) and unstable otherwise .",
    "from the arguments and results given in the two previous sections , we expect that for a gaussian attractive ( an example of short - range potential ) , two equilibrium solutions exist ; the uniform one , which is unstable against long wavelength deformations when @xmath128 , where @xmath1 is given by ( [ tcgaussd ] ) , and a non - uniform distribution , which we were unable to find analytically in a closed form .",
    "the aim of this section is to give numerical results for the one - dimensional gaussian potential .",
    "it is shown below that the predicted transition between these two states is indeed quite sharp when @xmath146 crosses @xmath1 and that , in addition , an hysteretic behaviour occurs .",
    "we choose @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) which yields @xmath158 .",
    "the unstability condition ( [ instable ] ) gives the critical temperature ( see ( [ tc ] ) ) : @xmath159    in order to analyze the equilibrium state(s ) @xmath39 arising in the mean - field treatment with the gaussian potential , we used two numerical procedures .",
    "the first one is a self - consistent iterative procedure for the equilibrium equation ( [ fpemfj0 ] ) , hereafter called static algorithm .",
    "the second one ( called dynamical algorithm ) numerically solves the one - dimensional version of the full equation ( [ fpemfdens ] ) , starting from a given initial condition @xmath160 , and gives the non - equilibrium evolution of the system .    with the static algorithm",
    ", we start from a trial density function @xmath161 and then iterate according to : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the normalisation constant .",
    "convergence is reached when the following quantity : @xmath164 becomes much less than unity .",
    "strict boundary conditions have been used , namely @xmath165 .",
    "these calculations allow first to check the existence of the sharp transition occurring at @xmath1 when the temperature is decreased starting with the uniform state ; second , they reveal a hysteretic behaviour : when the temperature is _ increased _ starting from the localized state ( one cluster ) , the transition from the localized state to the uniform one occurs at another temperature @xmath166 .    fig .",
    "[ equilgauss ] displays two typical density profiles ( uniform _ vs _ localized cluster ) , just above and just below @xmath1 obtained with this static algorithm .",
    "since the width of the localized state turns out to be a little bit smaller than the range @xmath60 of the potential , the central part of the cluster can be safely approximated by a gaussian ; indeed , when one expands the potential near @xmath167 , the harmonic potential is recovered ( if instead of a gaussian potential , one chooses @xmath168 , the central shape of the localized cluster is @xmath169 , as it must ( see ( [ pcoul1d ] ) ) since near the center this potential is essentially the coulomb one ) .",
    "obviously , such an approximation can not properly represent the tails of the equilibrium density .",
    "in order to characterize the transition , we introduce two quantities , @xmath170 and @xmath171 defined as follows : @xmath172 and : @xmath173 ^ 2       \\enspace .",

    "for the uniform state one has @xmath175 and @xmath176 ; on the contrary , for the localized state , @xmath177 and @xmath178 . for an infinite system ,",
    "the ratio @xmath179 vanishes , so that @xmath170 can play the role of an order parameter .",
    "the hysteresis is obtained as follows . for each given temperature , the starting point is the solution found in the previous run at a slightly different temperature . after a first sequence where",
    "@xmath180 is decreased step by step down to @xmath181 , the procedure is reversed , @xmath180 is increased , the iterative procedure starting again from the localized solution obtained for the previous value of @xmath180 .",
    "it is found that the inverse transition does not occur at @xmath182 , but at a _ higher _ temperature @xmath183 .    clearly ,",
    "for @xmath184 , several solutions can exist .",
    "since the width of the single peak solution is a bit smaller than the range @xmath60 of the potential , one can guess that there also exists a solution with two peaks separated by a distance much larger that @xmath60 .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical calculations : starting with a trial function having two separate peaks , the calculation converges towards a stable solution having the same features .",
    "one thus can claim that , on the low - temperature side , localized solutions exist displaying @xmath185 peaks .",
    "each of these solutions has its own temperature @xmath186 .",

    "the possibility of the @xmath34-peak solutions is confirmed by the dynamic algorithm ( it was checked that the latter eventually yields the same equilibrium solutions as the static one ) .",
    "this allows to conclude that a given @xmath187-peak solution is linearly stable for @xmath188 .",
    "note that the linear stability of the @xmath34-peak solutions above @xmath1 is not in contradiction with the results obtained in section [ stablan ] ; all this simply means that , in the region @xmath189 , both the uniform state and the localized state(s ) are stable against _ small _ perturbations .    defining the entropy as",
    "@xmath190 $ ] , it is seen that the one - peak solution is the one having the lowest free energy @xmath191 .",
    "it must be noted that each kind of states has its own relevant physical parameters .",
    "for the uniform state , the relevant parameters are @xmath192 and the critical temperature found by the linear stability analysis is a function of these parameters . for the localized state ,",
    "the relevant parameters are @xmath193 and @xmath0 , the number of particles .",
    "indeed , for this state , edge - effects become irrelevant when @xmath194 : in this sense @xmath65 becomes arbitrary so that @xmath104 and @xmath0 are in fact independent variables .",
    "the physical reason of the hysteresis can be understood as follows . in the uniform state ,",
    "a given particle interacts with a small ( microscopic ) number of particles ( @xmath195 ) ; on the contrary , in the localized state , a single particle interacts with a large number ( @xmath196 ) , macroscopic in the sense that all the particles effectively interact with anyone of them ( note that this also originates from the fact that the particles are of zero radius ) .",
    "the condition for the uniform - to - localized transition is expressed by @xmath197 ( see ( [ tc ] ) ) . for the inverse transition",
    ", one can expect that a somewhat similar condition also holds true , so that @xmath183 is an increasing function of @xmath0 ( and is independent of @xmath104 ) .",
    "it is likely that with pointlike particles @xmath183 goes to infinity with @xmath0 ; on the contrary , with finite - size particles , one can figure out that @xmath183 saturates at very large @xmath0 . as a whole",
    ", the hysteretic behaviour is a consequence of this parameter cross - over between the two kinds of steady states .",

    "the width @xmath174 of the cluster displays a cross - over between two regimes . on the low-@xmath146 side ,",

    "this behaviour is the same as for the harmonic case ( see [ harmonic ] ) , which suggests that a gaussian approximation is valid in the low-@xmath146 region .",
    "indeed , one can compare @xmath174 with the analytic expression ( [ pharm ] ) obtained for the harmonic case ( see figure [ regim ] ) .",
    "the agreement turns out to be quite good and this allows to claim that a gaussian approximation provides a very accurate description of the localized state arising in the low-@xmath146 region . for the second regime ( @xmath201 ) , the width of the cluster becomes of the same order or even greater than the potential range , so that the effective potential can not be well represented by a harmonic approximation .",
    "indeed , the increase of the cluster width with @xmath146 no more displays a gaussian behaviour , but still follows a power law .",
    "in the previous mean - field analysis , it was shown that brownian particles interacting through a gaussian potential can have several steady states when @xmath202 .",

    "these plots show that the dynamics is a succession of metastable states with a given number of peaks of high density , ( @xmath207-peak state , @xmath208-peak state , @xmath209-peak state , @xmath210-peak state ) .",
    "the lifetime of these states rapidly increases when the number of peaks gets lower ( note the horizontal logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "[ fall ] ) .",
    "because of computational time , we were unable to obtain the @xmath211-peak state . from static computations",
    ", it is believed that this state is expected to be the final one , although there is no evidence that the two algorithms have the same attraction basins .",
    "moreover , the @xmath211-peak state is not the only stable state : we have checked that also exist stationary @xmath212-peak , and @xmath210-peak states , a fact which seems nearly obvious on physical grounds since when the distance between two neighbouring peaks is much larger that the range @xmath60 no dynamics can occur .    from the time - dependent density profiles ( fig .",
    "[ evol ] ) , we see that `` nucleation '' always occurs at the boundaries of the box .",
    "this is easily understood , since a particle near this boundary is pulled from one side only , as opposed to a particle located in the bulk .",
    "this effect would disappear with periodic boundary conditions , indicating that the nucleation can only occur around an inhomogeneity .",
    "it is also interesting to follow the annihilation of the peaks .",
    "as an example , one goes from @xmath207 to @xmath208-peaks _ via _ the diffusion of the even peaks into the odd ones . generally speaking , it turns out that the transition towards a state having fewer peaks proceeds through the absorption of `` weak '' peaks into strong ones .",
    "the actual value of the density between the peaks , even when it is extremely small , turns out to be of first importance in this mechanism of coalescence .",
    "in this paper , we have studied properties of the @xmath0-body fokker - planck equation within a mean field aproximation . our aim was to analyse the properties of the steady state  which is a uniform density gas when interactions are set to zero  as a function of the features of the interaction potential .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the uniform state allowed to state the condition for a phase transition , as a result of the competing effects due to attractive interaction and to diffusive spreading .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the uniform phase is always unstable for non - summable attractive potentials , the critical temperature being infinite . in this latter case",
    ", analytical results have been given for specific potentials ( @xmath213-coulombian , harmonic , polynomials ) , all yielding an aggregated steady state .",
    "for an attractive short ranged interaction , the above stability condition was interpreted as a phase transition occurring at a finite @xmath1 .",
    "this transition was more thoroughly studied by numerical computations in a definite case ( gaussian potential ) and turns out to be of the first order and hysteretic , the low temperature state being an inhomogeneous state having one or several peaks of high density .",
    "the far - from - equilibrium dynamics was numerically computed for the gaussian potential , starting from the uniform state suddenly cooled below @xmath1 .",
    "the relaxation proceeds through a sequence of _ plateaux _ displaying a given decreasing number of peaks , each of the former having a longer and longer lifetime as time goes on .",
    "each of these steps can be viewed as a metastable state .",
    "obviously enough , the considered problem requires further investigations .",
    "one of them is the relevance of mean field approach .",
    "if one expects that mean field results should be basically valid for long ranged potentials and high space dimensionality , their correctness for short range potential has to be checked by using more refined approximations from @xmath0-body general methods .",
