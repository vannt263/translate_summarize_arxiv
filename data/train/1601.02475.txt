    "this result is consistent with those that average over the entire sky , but points out that significant variations in background distance measures will occur directly behind large gravitational lenses .    at the current time",
    ", one typically does not have particularly accurate measurements of the redshifts of the background sources used in gravitational lensing studies .",
    "therefore , in current studies , the effect of ignoring the perturbation of the lens in computing the approximate angular diameter distance to the average source galaxy may continue to be negligible .",
    "however , in the long run , this source of error will become more significant as it becomes easier to collect light from faint background galaxies in multiple filters allowing for reasonable measurements of photometric redshifts .",
