    "in recent years , rapid progress has been made in quantum simulation , whereby one engineers a quantum system to study important phenomena experimentally @xcite . periodically driven quantum systems ( floquet systems )",
    "are a particularly versatile platform for such simulations @xcite and have already been used to explore a variety of rich physics .",
    "this program has been particularly successful in cold atoms , where periodic driving has been integral to studying models of classical frustrated magnetism , and models of topological matter @xcite .",
    "these periodically driven systems have seen extensive theoretical modelling @xcite . some of these experiments have experienced unexpected heating @xcite . in an earlier paper",
    ", we began addressing the sources of this heating by studying collisions within a one - dimensional bec in a shaken optical lattice @xcite .",
    "we found that in the presence of strong transverse confinement , interactions can drive instabilities but that there were large parameter ranges where the system was stable . here",
    "we extend that work to the regime where there is no transverse confinement .",
    "the additional decay channels generally lead to more dissipation and diffusive dynamics .",
    "+ in this paper , we consider two paradigmatic examples of floquet systems in which a three dimensional bec is loaded into an a modulated one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the difference lies in the nature of the drive : we consider ( a ) amplitude modulation of lattice depth ( similar to the setup in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and ( b ) lattice shaking ( similar to the setup in ref .",
    "these two protocols are illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation for both systems and treat the inter - atomic interactions perturbatively .",
    "our analysis is along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite where we used fermi s golden rule to study the tight confinement limit .",
    "this kinetic approach can be contrasted with quantum coherent arguments such as those used by creffield in ref .",
    "creffield used the bogoliubov equations to look at a dynamical instability of a bec in a shaken one dimensional optical lattice .",
    "these decay channels are important when the interactions are strong .",
    "we consider a different limit : for most recent experiments , the interaction strengths are too low for the interaction - driven modification of the dispersion to be relevant , rather the physics is dominated by the energy and momentum conserving scattering processes which are accounted for through our kinetic equations . in a field - theoretic formulation",
    "this corresponds to only keeping the imaginary part of the self - energy .",
    "+ in section ii , we analyze the stability of a bec in an amplitude modulated tilted optical lattice .",
    "a similar analysis can be used for raman - driven lattices , such as those used to realize the harper hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it also applies to the study of density induced tunnelling @xcite and is related to earlier studies of bloch oscillations @xcite . in section iii , we study the stability of a bec loaded in a shaken optical lattice .",
    "this system can be mapped onto a classical spin model which exhibits a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition as well as a roton - maxon excitation spectrum @xcite . in both section ii and section iii ,",
    "we obtain analytical results for the lifetime of the bec .",
    "finally , in section iv , we discuss the general form of the dissipation rate in driven systems .",
    "in this section , we consider a bec in a deep tilted one dimensional optical lattice .",
    "adjacent sites are offset by an energy @xmath0 , suppressing tunneling ( @xmath1 being the nearest neighbor tunnelling matrix element ) .",
    "there is no transverse confinement , yielding a one - dimensional array of pancakes .",
    "the lattice depth is then modulated at a frequency @xmath2(@xmath3 ) so that tunnelling is restored between the pancakes .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this system is : @xmath4 the constant @xmath5 parameterizes the modulation of the hopping matrix element .",
    "the transverse spatial components are suppressed : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the coupling constant is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the wannier wavefunction in the @xmath11 direction , normalized so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the lattice spacing .",
    "this equation defines @xmath14 , the size of the wannier state and is valid if @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "+ depending on how one sets up the problem the @xmath10 used in eq.([wan ] ) will be either the wannier states of the static lattice , some time average of the instantaneous eigenstates or even some time - dependent function which yields an oscillating @xmath16",
    ". the distinction will be important if the drive frequency is resonant with a band changing collision or if the modulation amplitude is large .",
    "similarly , the relationship between @xmath17 and the lattice parameters may be renormalised by large amplitude driving and the time - dependence of the parameters may not be sinusoidal .",
    "for most present experiments , where the amplitude of oscillations is small , these effects can be ignored .",
    "+ as in @xcite , we now perform a gauge transformation to replace the tilt with a time dependent phase : @xmath18 the operators @xmath19 will evolve with a new hamiltonian @xmath20 , chosen so that @xmath21.\\ ] ] specializing to the resonant case @xmath22 , we fourier transform this equation yielding [ rf ] h^= _ k _ * k*(t ) b_*k*^b_*k * + _ * k_1,k_2,k_3*b_*k_1*^b_*k_2*^b_*k_3 * b_*k_4 * , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath13 is the lattice spacing .",

    "it takes the form of a tight - binding model along z with a nearest - neighbor hopping of strength @xmath5 .",

    "( [ sol ] ) in powers of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . neglecting off - resonant terms and making the standard approximation @xmath54 , finding    @xmath55    which is analogous to fermi s golden rule .",
    "the result can also be derived using the formulation in ref .",
    "the first term proportional to @xmath56 is naturally interpreted as coming from a pair of particles absorbing a lattice vibration .",
    "the second term involves one particle  hopping downhill \" with the potential energy converted to transverse motion .",
    "+ we now calculate the total rate of scattering out of the condensate .",
    "the relevant timescale is @xmath57 the sums over @xmath58 are straightforward .",
    "we first note that that because @xmath5 is small , the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath60 is weak , and can be neglected .",
    "thus the sum over @xmath58 just yields a constant @xmath61 putting in the factors of @xmath62 the total rate of scattering out of the condensate is @xmath63 some typical numbers are @xmath64hz@xmath65hz@xmath66hz@xmath67khz and @xmath68 nm . for @xmath69 , the scattering length is @xmath70 nm . thus the lifetime of the bec is about @xmath71ms .",
    "is the single - particle energy , @xmath58 is the quasi - momentum and @xmath13 is the lattice spacing .",
    "since floquet energies are only defined modulo the shaking quanta @xmath72 , the energy of the second band has been shifted down by @xmath72 .",
    "alternatively , this shift can be interpreted as working in a dressed basis , where the energy includes a contribution from the phonons .",
    "the mixing between the bands depends on the shaking amplitude .",
    "dashed curves correspond to weak shaking , where the first band has its minimum at @xmath73 .",
    "solid curves correspond to strong shaking , where there are two minima at @xmath74 . ]    in this section , we look at the stability of a three - dimensional bec loaded into a shaken one - dimensional optical lattice .",

    "[ fig2 ] , due to level repulsion between the bloch bands , the ground band exhibits a bifurcation from having one minimum at @xmath76 to two minima at @xmath77 .",
    "this is analogous to the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition in landau theory for classical spin models . in the paramagnetic regime",
    "the bosons always condense at @xmath78 , while in the ferromagnetic regime , the bosons condense at some finite momentum @xmath79 . here , we first perturbatively analyze the stability of a bec against collisions in the limit of weak forcing amplitude .",
    "this gives an intuitive picture about how the scattering rate varies with amplitude .",
    "we then numerically calculate collision rates for larger shaking amplitudes spanning the experimentally interesting critical region .",
    "we find that the linearised theory over - estimates the damping , but gives the correct order of magnitude . +      in the frame co - moving with the lattice",

    "<S> motivated by recent experiments , we analyze the stability of a three - dimensional bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) loaded in a periodically driven one - dimensional optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> such periodically driven systems do not have a thermodynamic ground state , but may have a long - lived steady state which is an eigenstate of a  floquet hamiltonian \" . </S>",
    "<S> we explore collisional instabilities of the floquet ground state which transfer energy into the transverse modes . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate decay rates , finding that the lifetime scales as the inverse square of the scattering length and inverse of the peak three - dimensional density . </S>",
    "<S> these rates can be controlled by adding additional transverse potentials . </S>"
