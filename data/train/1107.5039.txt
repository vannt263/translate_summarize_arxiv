    "in recent years , authors such as @xcite , hereafter b07 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and others , have made use of archival data ( observations of calibration fields , or in some cases , entire telescope archives ) to search for radio transients .",
    "other studies have targeted particular fields with observations dedicated to the search for transients ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "such studies are preparing the groundwork for a new generation of high - throughput radio telescopes : both dedicated new observatories  for example , the allen telescope array @xcite , lofar @xcite , and askap @xcite  and upgrades to older instruments  for example , apertif @xcite and evla @xcite .",
    "a major goal for these new facilities is to survey large areas of sky at high sensitivity , both to build up deep , wide - field images , and to search for transient and variable sources from a range of progenitors @xcite .",
    "currently , large areas of rate versus sensitivity parameter space remain to be explored @xcite , and the radio transient population is not well understood . in observations where radio transients are detected , sometimes counterparts are seen in existing surveys at other wavelengths .",
    "for example , transients may coincide with the nuclear regions of galaxies , in which case ( depending on the galaxy redshift and hence the inferred radio luminosity of the transients ) they are most likely due to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , or perhaps supernovae ( sne ) or gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) . or they may be offset from the peak of the optical emission , as is the case for two of the transients seen by b07 , leading to their interpretation as sne or grbs .    for some radio transients ,",
    "however , no counterparts are seen in archival images at other wavelengths , and no follow - up observations taken close in time to when the transients were seen are available .",
    "follow - up observations will become more common as radio observatories move increasingly into a regime of issuing transient alerts for rapid follow - up by other facilities , but the field is still in its infancy compared to optical transient facilities which are now issuing transient alerts as a matter of routine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the lack of galaxy counterparts in deep optical images can help exclude some models for these sources ( such as agns , sne and grbs , unless these sources are at very high redshift or extremely obscured ) , and the lack of stellar counterparts can also constrain models with galactic progenitors for these events .",
    "b07 consider radio sne , grbs , late - type stars , soft gamma - ray repeaters , x - ray binaries , pulsars , microlensing , and reflected solar flares as possible progenitors .",
    "they conclude that late - type stars are the most likely progenitors for transients with mjy radio fluxes and no optical counterparts .",
    "@xcite , hereafter o10 , suggest old isolated galactic neutron stars as a possible progenitor for the sources without optical identifications , and @xcite suggest that the sources with optical counterparts may be due to neutron star ",
    "neutron star or neutron star  black hole mergers .",
    "the latter are of particular interest because they are expected to also be producers of gravitational waves .",
    "x - ray observations can be a powerful discriminant among progenitor models , but information on the x - ray properties of the transients and transient hosts is limited . with this in mind , we obtained _ chandra _  observations of the b07 field .",
    "we assume an @xmath7  cosmology @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are given in the vega system unless stated otherwise .",
    "b07 analyzed archival data at 5 and 8.4ghz of a very large array ( vla ) calibration field centered at @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the data spanned @xmath10yr with 944 epochs , approximately one per week , each with an integration time of @xmath10min , all on the same field .",
    "the images had a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 86 and 51 at 5 and 8.4ghz respectively , and typical root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuations at the center of the images were @xmath11@xmath12jy  per epoch .",
    "b07 compared the images from epoch to epoch , and detected 7 single - epoch transient sources at 5ghz , and 1 at 8.4ghz .",
    "the transients are listed in table  [ tab : radio ] .",
    "b07 denoted these sources with identifiers beginning `` rt '' and the epoch in which they were observed ; for convenience and clarity here we denote the 5ghz and 8ghz transients with identifiers beginning `` 5 t '' and `` 8 t '' respectively , although their formal identifiers are those beginning `` rt '' with an epoch of observation as cross - referenced in table  [ tab : radio ] .",
    "for each of these transients , there was no simultaneous coverage at the other of the two observing frequencies , and no detection of the sources in longer - timescale average images .",

    "two transients are referred to by b07 as `` possible '' matches , one with a galaxy at @xmath67 , and the other with a galaxy with unknown redshift ( see table  [ tab : radio ] ) , but the images of o10 suggest that both of these associations are unlikely .",
    "we consider these two , like the remaining six b07 radio transients , to be unidentified in all the oir images from b07 and o10 .    as discussed above , b07",

    "o10 also suggest that the transients seen at the nasu pulsar observatory by @xcite and other papers from the same group may be members of the same class .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggested that the nasu transients are probably not astronomical events , and that their quoted rate is at odds with other measurements , although the parameters of the nasu survey are not clear from the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , the b07 transient rate is consistent with measurements from other surveys ( see , for example , @xcite , fig .",

    "o10 show that for most classes of object , in particular extragalactic events including supernovae and gamma ray bursts , one would expect a large fraction of the transients to have associated host galaxies .",

    "because of the uncertainty regarding these two associations , it is plausible that all of the b07 transients remain undetected in our x - ray images .    the measured x - ray flux for the transient with a marginal x - ray detection ( x124/8l1 ) , and the upper limits for the undetected transients , are consistent with the x - ray luminosity expected for brown dwarfs at distances @xmath744pc , one of the possible progenitors discussed by o10 .",
    "the small offset between the x124 and 8l1 positions could plausibly be due to the proper motion of such an object .    if instead the transients are due to flaring m stars , most of the radio transients ought to have been detected in quiescence in both the x - ray and oir images , unless the flares were extreme events ( not out of the question , since we know the radio flux densities increased by a factor @xmath765 ) from progenitors at distances @xmath6kpc .",
    "the x - ray fluxes are also consistent with the suggestion of o10 that the transients could be isolated neutron stars .",
    "the radio and oir fluxes are consistent with this picture as well . if x124 is truly a counterpart to 8l1 , hardness ratio constraints appear to rule out a simple one - component spectral model , but there are insufficient data to attempt a more sophisticated fit with additional thermal or non - thermal components .",
    "if the progenitors have x - ray fluxes slightly fainter than our sensitivity limit , deeper observations would be expected to detect more of the transients in x - rays , as well as improving the significance of the fainter detection ( or rejecting it as a real source ) .",
    "x - ray or radio monitoring campaigns lasting for several months would have a good chance of catching these sources in outburst since for the most likely classes of progenitor , flares are likely to repeat . near- or mid - infrared data would also be useful to confirm or refute the brown dwarf hypothesis .",
