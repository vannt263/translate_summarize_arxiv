    "the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) is a far - reaching concept in the heart of many gravity theories .",
    "if eep is valid , then gravitation must be a curved - spacetime phenomenon . as a direct consequence ,",
    "gravity theories which fully embody eep are the so - called `` metric theories of gravity''@xcite .",
    "the validity of eep involves three different aspects , namely the weak equivalence principle , the local lorentz invariance ( lli ) , and the local position invariance ( lpi)@xcite .    in the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn )",
    "framework@xcite , we present the orbital dynamics of binary systems from a generic semi - conservative lagrangian , based on which , new tests of strong - field lli - violating ppn parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are proposed@xcite .",
    "new limits are obtained from small - eccentricity relativistic neutron star ( ns ) white dwarf ( wd ) systems , psrs j1012 + 5307@xcite and j1738 + 0333@xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the analysis and results of ref .  .",
    "we also propose a new test of the strong - field lpi - violating ppn parameter , @xmath2 , and get a new limit @xmath4 .",
    "all limits in this proceeding contribution correspond to 95% confidence level , and the ppn parameters with `` hat '' represent the strong - field generalization of the weak - field ppn parameters ( without hat ) . the preferred frame is assumed to be defined by the isotropic cmb background .",
    "lli violation in the gravity sector is described by @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the ppn framework@xcite , and these two parameters are constrained by various observations of geophysics , solar system , and pulsar timing experiments@xcite . recently in ref .  , we find that the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the binary orbital dynamics decouple and manifest characteristic signatures when the orbital eccentricity is small ( see fig .  1 in ref .   for illustrations ) , hence they can be constrained individually .",
    "damour and esposito - farse are the first to work out the effects of @xmath0 on orbital dynamics of pulsar binaries@xcite . after dropping @xmath1 related terms",
    ", they found that in the limit of a small eccentricity , @xmath0 induces a polarization of the orbit .",
    "the effect linearly depends on @xmath0 and the binary velocity with respect to the preferred frame , @xmath7 . due to unknown angles",
    ", previous methods can only get probabilistic limits on @xmath0 .",
    "demonstrates that , given a sufficiently long observing time span , the large periastron advance would be able to overcome probabilistic assumptions . by utilizing the limits of eccentricity variations , we get a robust and conservative constraint , @xmath8 from psr j1738 + 0333 .",
    "it surpasses the current best limit from llr@xcite by a factor of five .    in the limit of a small eccentricity",
    ", @xmath1 induces a precession of the orbital angular momentum around @xmath7 .",
    "it changes the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the earth . after subtracting other potential astrophysical and gravitational contributions ,",
    "we get a combined limit from psrs j1012 + 5307 and j1738 + 0333@xcite , @xmath9 this limit is still three orders of magnitude less constraining than the limit given in ref .",
    ", however , it is obtained for a strongly self - gravitating body .",
    "lpi violation is described by the whitehead s term , characterized by @xmath10@xcite . even for fully conservative theories of gravity one may have a @xmath11 . from its lagrangian",
    ", we can immediately identify its analogy with the @xmath6 term by replacing @xmath7 into @xmath12 and @xmath6 into @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the galactic potential at the position of the binary , and @xmath15 is the direction of the galactic acceleration .",
    "hence , for small - eccentricity binaries , @xmath10 induces a precession of orbital angular momentum around @xmath15 , which causes a change in the binary orientation . the same analysis done for @xmath1 in ref",
    ".   applies to the @xmath2 test .",
    "the probability distributions of @xmath2 from psrs j1012 + 5307 , j1738 + 0333 , and their combination are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] ( cf . fig .  4 in ref .  ) . from their combination",
    ", we get @xmath16 which surpasses the limit from the non - detection of anomalous earth tide in gravimeter data@xcite by one order of magnitude .",
