    "there has been a resurgence of interest in studies of the crossover between the usual bcs form of fermionic superfluidity and that associated with bose einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "this is due , in part , to the widespread pseudogap phenomena which have been observed in high temperature superconductors in conjunction with the small pair size .",
    "the latter , in particular , was argued by leggett to be a rationale @xcite for treating the cuprates as mid - way between bcs and bec .",
    "others have argued @xcite that the cuprate pseudogap can be understood as arising from pre - formed pairs which form due to the stronger - than - bcs attraction .",
    "additional reasons for the interest in bcs - bec crossover stem from the precise realization of this scenario in ultracold trapped fermi gases,@xcite where the attractive interaction can be continuously tuned from weak to strong via a feshbach resonance in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "a final rationale for interest in this problem stems from the fact that bcs theory is the prototype for successful theories in condensed matter physics ; and we now have come to realize that this is a very special case of a much more general class of superfluidity .",
    "bcs - bec crossover theory is based on the observation @xcite that the usual bcs ground state wave function @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation and annihilation operators for fermions of momentum @xmath7 and spin @xmath8 ) is far more general than was initially appreciated . if one tunes the attractive interaction from weak to strong , along with a self consistent determination of the variational parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 the chemical potential passes from positive to negative and the system crosses continuously from bcs to bec .",
    "the vast majority ( with the possible exception of the high @xmath1 cuprates ) of metallic superconductors are associated with weak attraction and large pair size .",
    "thus , this more generalized form of bcs theory was never fully characterized or exploited until recently .",
    "there are a number of different renditions of bcs - bec crossover theory .",
    "each rendition can be represented by a selected class of many - body feynman diagrams , often further simplified by various essential or non - essential approximations .",
    "there is no controlled small parameter and thus the selection process is based on highly variable criteria . for the most part",
    "the success or failure of a particular rendition is evaluated by comparing one or a set of numbers with experiment .",
    "it is the goal of the present paper to discuss a criteria set for evaluating bcs - bec crossover theories which captures the crucial physics , rather than the detailed numerics .",
    "we apply these criteria successfully to one particular version of bcs - bec crossover theory which builds on the above ground state . in this context",
    "we address a wide range of physical phenomena .",
    "these include density profiles , thermodynamical properties and superfluid density with application to polarized as well as unpolarized gases .",
    "_ it is our philosophy that appropriate tests of the theory should relate to how qualitatively sound it is before assessing it in quantitative detail_. detailed quantitative tests are essential but if the qualitative physics is not satisfactory , quantitative comparisons can not be meaningful .",
    "four important and inter - related physical properties are emphasized here .",
    "( i ) there must be a consistent treatment of `` pseudogap ''",
    "effects.@xcite as a consequence of the fact that the pairing onset temperature @xmath0 is different @xcite from the condensation temperature @xmath1 , the fermionic spectrum , @xmath2 must necessarily reflect the formation of these pairs . to accommodate the pseudogap ,",
    "@xmath2 must be modified from the strict bcs form which has a vanishing excitation gap at and above @xmath1 . everywhere in the literature an unphysical form for @xmath2",
    "is assumed except in our own work and briefly in ref .  .",
    "( ii ) the theory must yield a consistent description of the superfluid density @xmath3 from zero to @xmath1 .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 should be single valued , monotonic , @xcite and disappear at the same @xmath1 one computes from the normal state instability .",
    "importantly , @xmath3 is at the heart of a proper description of the superfluid phase .",
    "( iii ) the behavior of the density profiles , which are the basis for computing thermodynamical properties of trapped gases , must be compatible with experimental measurements . near and at unitarity , and in the absence of population imbalance , they are relatively smooth and featureless , unlike a true bec where there is clear bimodality .",
    "this can present a challenge for theories which do not accommodate pseudogap effects and which then deduce sharp features at the condensate edge .",
    "( iv ) the thermodynamical potential @xmath11 should be variationally consistent with the gap and number equations .",
    "it should satisfy appropriate maxwell relations and at unitarity be compatible with the constraint @xcite relating the pressure @xmath12 to the energy , @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "there has been widespread discussion about the role of collective modes in the thermodynamics of fermionic superfluids . and",
    "this has become , in some instances , a basis for additional evaluation criteria of a given bcs - bec crossover theory .",
    "because the fermi gases represent neutral superfluids with low lying collective modes , one might have expected these modes to be more important than in charged superconductors .",
    "nevertheless , the bcs wave function and its associated finite temperature behavior is well known to work equally well for charged superconductors and neutral superfluids such as helium-3 . in strict bcs theory thermodynamical properties",
    "are governed only by fermionic excitations .",
    "this applies as well to the superfluid density ( in the transverse gauge ) .",
    "collective modes are important in strict bcs theory primarily to establish that @xmath3 is properly gauge invariant .",
    "one can argue @xcite that collective modes should enter thermodynamics as the pairing attraction becomes progressively stronger .",
    "the role of these modes at unitarity is currently unresolved . in the bogoliubov description of a true bose superfluid",
    "there is a coupling between the pair excitations and the collective modes , which results from inter - boson interactions .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect that the collective modes are important for thermodynamical properties in the bec regime . at the level of the simple mean bcs - leggett wave function we find that ,",
    "just as in strict bcs theory , the collective modes do not couple to the pair excitations ; this leads to a @xmath15 form of the pair dispersion .",
    "the low - lying collective mode dispersion is,@xcite of course , linear in @xmath16 .",
    "all inter - boson effects are treated in a mean field sense and enter to renormalize the effective pair mass @xmath17 .",
    "to arrive at a theory more closely analogous to bogoliubov theory , one needs to add additional terms to the ground state wave function consisting of four and six creation operators @xcite in the deep bec .",
    "the complexity becomes even greater in the unitary regime , and there is , in our opinion , no clear indication one way or the other on how the pair excitations and collective modes couple .",
    "our rationale for considering the simplest ground state wave function ( which minimizes this coupling ) is as follows .",
    "it is the basis for zero temperature bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) approaches which have been widely applied to the crossover problem .",
    "it is the basis for a @xmath18 gross - pitaevskii description in the far bec regime.@xcite it is the basis for the bulk of the work on population imbalanced gases . at unitarity",
    "the universality relation @xcite between pressure and energy holds ",
    "separately for the fermionic contribution ( which is of the usual bcs form with an excitation gap distinct from the order parameter ) and for the bosonic term , due to the @xmath19 form of the pair dispersion . finally , this wave function is simple and accessible .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to begin by addressing the finite @xmath20 physics which is associated with this ground state , in a systematic way .",
    "the remainder of this paper presents first the theoretical framework for the principal self consistent equations describing the total excitation gap , the order parameter , and the number equation or fermionic chemical potential .",
    "the consequences for thermodynamics , density profiles and the superfluid density are then presented in separate sections , along with numerically obtained results for each property .",
    "we discuss these properties at the qualitative as well as semi - quantitative level , in the context of comparison with experiment . in the conclusions section ,",
    "we present a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the present scheme .",
    "while the subject began with the seminal @xmath18 work by eagles @xcite and leggett,@xcite a discussion of superfluidity beyond the ground state was first introduced into the literature by nozieres and schmitt - rink .",
    "@xcite randeria and co - workers reformulated this approach @xcite and moreover , raised the interesting possibility that crossover physics might be relevant to high temperature superconductors @xcite . subsequently other workers have applied this picture to the high @xmath1 cuprates @xcite and ultracold fermi gases @xcite as well as formulated alternative schemes @xcite for addressing @xmath21 .",
    "the recognition that one should distinguish the pair formation temperature @xmath0 from the condensation temperature @xmath1 was crucial .",
    "@xcite credit goes to those who noted that pseudogap effects would appear in the bcs - bec crossover scenario of high temperature superconductors , notably first in the spin channel .",
    "@xcite shortly thereafter , it was recognized that these important pseudogap phenomena also pertain to the charge channel .",
    "@xcite and finally , we make note of those papers where the concept of pseudogap effects was introduced into studies of the ultra - cold gases .",
    "@xcite      in this section we discuss the present scheme for bcs - bec crossover , as well as compare it with alternative approaches including that of nozieres and schmitt - rink .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian for bcs - bec crossover can be described by a one - channel model . in this paper , we address primarily a short range @xmath22-wave pairing interaction , which is often simplified as a contact potential @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "this hamiltonian has been known to provide a good description for the crossover in atomic fermi gases which have very wide feshbach resonances , such as @xmath25k and @xmath26li .",
    "the details are presented elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    we begin with a discussion of t - matrix based theories . within a t - matrix scheme one",
    "considers the coupled equations between the particles ( with propagator @xmath27 ) and the pairs [ which can be represented by the @xmath20-matrix @xmath28 and drops all higher order terms . without taking higher order green s functions into account , the pairs interact indirectly via the fermions , in an averaged or mean field sense .",
    "the propagator for the non - condensed pairs is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the attractive coupling constant in the hamiltonian and @xmath31 is the pair susceptibility .",
    "the function @xmath32 is the most fundamental quantity in t - matrix approaches .",
    "it is given by the product of dressed and bare green s functions in various combinations .",
    "one could , in principle , have considered two bare green s functions or two fully dressed green s functions . here , we follow the work of ref .   .",
    "these authors systematically studied the equations of motion for the green s functions associated with the usual many body hamiltonian for superfluidity and deduced that the only satisfactory truncation procedure for these equations involves a t - matrix with one dressed and one bare green s function .",
    "the presence of the bare green s function in the @xmath20-matrix and self - energy is a general , inevitable consequence of an equations of motion procedure .",
    "@xcite    in this approach , the pair susceptibility is then @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath27 and @xmath35 are the full and bare green s functions respectively .",
    "here @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the kinetic energy of fermions , and @xmath39 is the fermionic chemical potential . throughout this paper , we take @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and use the four - vector notation @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , etc , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the standard odd and even matsubara frequencies @xcite ( where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are integers ) .",
    "the one - particle green s function is @xmath49 where @xmath50 more generally , either @xmath51 or the fully dressed @xmath27 is introduced into @xmath52 , according to the chosen @xmath20-matrix scheme .",
    "finally , in terms of green s functions , we readily arrive at the number equation : @xmath53 .",
    "because of interest from high temperature superconductivity , alternate schemes , which involve only dressed green s functions have been rather widely studied . in one alternative ,",
    "one constructs a thermodynamical potential based on a chosen self - energy .",
    "here there is some similarity to that @xmath20-matrix scheme which involves @xmath27 only .",
    "one variant of this `` conserving approximation '' is known as the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) which has been primarily applied to the normal state .",
    "in addition to the particle - particle ladder diagrams which are crucial to superfluidity it also includes less critical diagrams in the particle - hole channel ; the latter can be viewed as introducing spin correlation effects .",
    "since it involves only dressed green s functions , one evident advantage of this approach is that it is @xmath54-derivable @xcite or conserving .",
    "this implies that because it is based on an analytical expression for the thermodynamical potential , thermodynamical quantities obtained by derivatives of the free energy are identical to those computed directly from the single particle green s function .    for a variety of reasons",
    "this flex scheme , as applied to superfluids and superconductors , has been found to be problematic . the earliest critique of the @xmath55 , t - matrix scheme is in ref .  .",
    "the authors noted that using two dressed green s functions `` could be rejected by means of a variational principle '' .",
    "they also observed that there would be an unphysical consequence : a low @xmath20 specific heat which contained a contribution proportional to @xmath56 . in a related fashion",
    "it appears that the flex or @xmath55 , t - matrix scheme is _ not _ demonstrably consistent with the hamiltonian - based equations of motion .",
    "there also is concern that considering only dressed fermion propagators , @xmath27 , may lead to double counting of feynman diagrams .",
    "vilk et al @xcite noted that the flex scheme will not produce a proper pseudogap , due to the `` inconsistent treatment of vertex corrections in the expression for the self energy . ''    by dropping the non - dominant particle - hole diagrams , others have found a more analytically tractable scheme @xcite .",
    "however , this scheme fails to yield back bcs - like spectral properties which would be anticipated above @xmath1 in a bcs - bec crossover scenario . among the unusual features found is a four excitation branch structure , @xcite not compatible with the expected pseudogap description , which should reflect precursor superconductivity effects in the normal state . in this pseudogap picture ,",
    "@xcite there would be two peaks in the spectral function , rather than four .",
    "more recently , the authors of ref .   applied a related conserving approximation below @xmath1 .",
    "they did not consider particle - hole diagrams , but included in the particle - particle channel a `` twisted '' ladder diagram .",
    "these authors found that there was a discontinuity in the transition temperature calculated relative to that computed @xcite above @xmath1 .",
    "they , then , inferred that at unitarity there is a first order phase transition , which has not been experimentally observed .    in the nsr scheme , which is ,",
    "perhaps , the most widely applied of all pair fluctuation theories , one uses two bare green s functions in @xmath32 for the normal state . within this nsr approach",
    ", the results are generally extended below @xmath1 by introducing @xcite into @xmath32 the diagonal and off - diagonal forms of the nambu - gorkov greens functions .",
    "at the outset , the fermionic excitation spectrum @xmath57 involves only the superfluid order parameter , @xmath58 , so that the fermions are treated as gapless at and above @xmath1 , despite the fact that there is an expected `` pseudogap '' associated with pairing onset temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the original authors @xcite suggested that pair fluctuations should enter into the number equation , but approximated their form based on only the leading contribution in the dyson series .",
    "this approximate form was introduced via contribution to the thermodynamical potential @xmath11 . a more systematic approach , which is based on a full dyson resummation leads to a form equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq:3a ] ) , with a bare @xmath59 , as was first pointed out in ref .  .",
    "this more complete scheme was implemented in ref .  .",
    "another important aspect of the nsr scheme should be noted .",
    "because the pairing fluctuation contributions do not enter into the gap equation , the gap equation can not be determined from a variational condition on the thermodynamic potential . in this regard , a rather different alternative to the approximated number equation of ref .",
    "was recently introduced in ref .  .",
    "these authors argued one should compensate for the fact that @xmath60 by adding a new term ( deriving from this discrepancy ) to the number equation .",
    "we view this latter alternative as even more problematic since it builds on inconsistencies within the nsr approach in _ both _ the gap and the number equation . by far",
    "the most complete study of the nsr based theory for crossover was summarized in ref .  .",
    "by systematically introducing a series of improved approximations , the authors ultimately noted that one must incorporate pairing fluctuation corrections into the gap as well as the number equation .    it should be stressed that ( with or without the approximate form for the number equation ) _ the nsr scheme at @xmath61 was not designed to be consistent with the simple bcs - leggett ground state , which they also discussed at length_. this observation was implicitly made elsewhere @xcite in the literature and can be verified by comparing the ground state density profiles based on the nsr scheme with those obtained in the leggett mean field theory .",
    "@xcite it should also be stressed that t - matrix theories do not incorporate a direct pair - pair interaction ; rather the pairs interact in an average or mean field sense .",
    "if one tries to extract the effective pairing interaction from _ any _ @xmath20-matrix theory , the absence of coupling to higher order green s functions will lead to a simple factor of two relating the inter - boson and inter - fermion scattering lengths .",
    "more exact calculations of this ratio lead to a factor of 0.6 .",
    "@xcite      we now show that one obtains consistent answers between @xmath20-matrix based approaches and the bcs - leggett ground state equations , provided the pair susceptibility contains one bare and one dressed green s function .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we refer to the present approach as `` @xmath62 theory '' . throughout this paper",
    "we will emphasize the strengths of the present t - matrix scheme which rest primarily on a consistent treatment of pseudogap effects in the gap and number equations .",
    "this , in turn , leads to physical behavior for the thermodynamics , the superfluid density and the density profiles at all temperatures .",
    "finally , we note that the present t - matrix scheme is readily related to a previously studied @xcite approach to fluctuations in low dimensional , but conventional superconductors .",
    "a weak coupling limit of this @xmath62 approach is equivalent to hartree approximated ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "we begin with the situation in which there is an equal spin mixture , and then generalize to the population imbalanced case . in the present formalism , for all @xmath63",
    ", the gap equation is associated with a bec condition which requires that the pair chemical potential @xmath64 vanish .",
    "we will show below that because of this vanishing of @xmath64 at and below @xmath1 , to a good approximation one can move @xmath51 outside the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3a ] ) . as a result",
    "the self - energy is of the bcs - like form @xmath65 thus @xmath66    now we are in a position to calculate the pair susceptibility at general @xmath67 , based on eq .",

    "it follows that @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 the vanishing of @xmath64 ( or generalized thouless criterion ) then implies that @xmath74 substituting @xmath72 into the above bec condition , we obtain the familiar gap equation @xmath75 here @xmath76 , which contains the total excitation gap @xmath77 instead of the order parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath30 can be replaced in favor of the dimensionless parameter , @xmath78 , via the relationship @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the two - body @xmath22-wave scattering length , and @xmath81 is the noninteracting fermi wave vector for the same total number density .",
