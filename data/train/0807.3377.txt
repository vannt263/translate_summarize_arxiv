    "this article aims at studying some classical analysis problems in semimetric spaces , in which the distance is not required to satisfy the triangle inequity . during the author s recent study of optimal transport path between probability measures",
    ", he observes that there exists a family of very interesting semimetrics on the space of atomic probability measures .",
    "these semimetrics satisfy a relaxed triangle inequality @xmath3 for some constant @xmath4 , rather than the usual triangle inequality .",
    "such semimetric spaces are called quasimetric spaces in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "these family of quasimetrics indeed induce a family of intrinsic metrics on the space of atomic probability measures .",
    "furthermore , optimal transport paths studied early in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite etc turn out to be exactly geodesics in these induced metric spaces .",
    "this observation motivates us to study the geodesic problem in quasimetric spaces in this article .",
    "other closely related works on ramified optimal transportation may be found in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite etc .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first introduce the concept as well as some basic properties of quasimetric spaces , then we extend some well - known results ( e.g. ascoli - arzel theorem ) about continuous functions in metric spaces to continuous functions in quasimetric spaces .",
    "after that , in section 3 , we consider the geodesic problem in quasimetric spaces .",
    "we show that every continuous quasimetric will induce an intrinsic pseudometric on the space . in case",
    "that the quasimetric is nice enough ( e.g. either `` ideal '' or `` perfect '' in the sense of definition def_ideal or definition [ perfect ] ) , then the quasimetric will indeed induce an intrinsic metric . in the end",
    ", we spend the last section in discussing our motivation example : optimal transport paths between atomic probability measures .",
    "we first introduce a family of quasimetrics on the space of atomic probability measures .",
    "each of these quasimetric is both ideal and perfect , and thus it induces an intrinsic metric on the space of atomic probability measures .",
    "we showed that the @xmath5-metrics introduced in@xcite is simply the intrinsic metrics induced by these quasimetrics .",
    "furthermore , each geodesic in these length spaces corresponds to an optimal transport path studied in @xcite .",
