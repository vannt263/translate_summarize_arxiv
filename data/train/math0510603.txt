    "the morse - sard theorem @xcite states that if @xmath14 is a @xmath15 smooth function , with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the set of critical points of @xmath18 , then the set of critical values @xmath19 is of lebesgue measure zero in @xmath20 .",
    "this result has proven to be very valuable in a large number of areas , especially in differential topology and analysis ( see for instance @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "additional geometric and analytical properties of the set of critical values in different versions of the morse - sard theorem , together with a study on the sharpness of the hypothesis of the morse - sard theorem , have been obtained in @xcite .    for many important applications of the morse - sard theorem ,",
    "it is enough to know that any given continuous function can be uniformly approximated by a smooth map whose set of critical values has empty interior @xcite .",
    "we refer to this as an _ approximate morse - sard theorem_. the same type of approximation could prove key to the study of related problems in the infinite - dimensional domain .    in this paper , we will prove the strongest version of an approximate morse - sard theorem that one can expect to be true for a general infinite - dimensional separable banach space , namely that every continuous function @xmath21 , where @xmath0 is an infinite - dimensional banach space @xmath0 with separable dual @xmath9 , can be uniformly approximated by a @xmath3 smooth function @xmath22 which does not have any critical point . in some cases where more information about the structure of the banach space @xmath0 is known",
    ", we will extend our result to higher order of differentiability , @xmath10 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "our result will also allow us to demonstrate two important corollaries .",
    "the first one is the existence of _ a non - linear hahn - banach theorem _ which shows that two disjoint closed subsets in @xmath0 can be separated by a 1-codimensional @xmath10 smooth manifold of @xmath0 ( which is the set of zeros of a @xmath10 smooth function with no critical points on @xmath0 ) .",
    "the second one states that every closed subset of @xmath0 can be approximated by @xmath10 smooth open subsets of @xmath0 .    to put our work in context ,",
    "let us briefly review some of the work established for the infinite - dimensional version of the morse - sard theorem .",
    "smale @xcite proved that if @xmath0 and @xmath24 are separable connected smooth manifolds modelled on banach spaces and @xmath25 is a @xmath15 fredholm map then @xmath19 is of first baire category and , in particular , @xmath19 has no interior points provided that @xmath26 for all @xmath7 . here",
    ", index(@xmath27 ) stands for the index of the fredholm operator @xmath27 , that is , the difference between the dimension of the kernel of @xmath27 and the codimension of the image of @xmath27 , which are both finite .",
    "these assumptions are very strong as they impose that when @xmath0 is infinite - dimensional then @xmath24 is necessarily infinite - dimensional too ( in other words , there is no fredholm map @xmath28 ) .",
    "in fact , as kupka proved in @xcite , there are @xmath29 smooth functions @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the separable hilbert space ) such that their sets of critical values @xmath19 contain intervals and hence have non - empty interiors and positive lebesgue measure .",
    "bates and moreira @xcite showed that this function @xmath18 can even be taken to be a polynomial of degree three .",
    "azagra and cepedello - boiso @xcite have shown that every continuous mapping from the separable hilbert space into @xmath20 can be uniformly approximated by @xmath29 smooth mappings with no critical points . unfortunately , since the core of their proof requires the use of the special properties of the hilbertian norm , this can not be extended to non - hilbertian banach spaces .",
    "p. hjek and m. johanis @xcite established the same kind of result in the case when @xmath0 is a separable banach space which contains @xmath32 and admits a @xmath10-smooth bump function . in this case , the approximating functions are of class @xmath10 , @xmath33 .",
    "this method is based on the result that the range of the derivative of a @xmath34 smooth function from @xmath32 to @xmath35 is a countable union of compact sets @xcite .",
    "however , as the authors noted , their method is not applicable when the space @xmath0 has the radon - nikodm property ( e.g. , when @xmath0 is reflexive ) , which leaves out all the classical banach spaces @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "as stated above , we prove that for any infinite - dimensional banach space @xmath0 with a separable dual @xmath9 , the set of @xmath3 smooth , real - valued functions with no critical points is uniformly dense in the space of all continuous , real - valued functions on @xmath0 .",
    "this solves completely the problem of the approximation on separable banach spaces by smooth , real - valued functions with no critical points when the order of smoothness of the approximating functions is one .",
    "hence , we obtain the following characterization . for a separable banach space @xmath0 , the following are equivalent : ( i )",
    "@xmath9 is separable , and ( ii ) the set of @xmath3 smooth , real - valued functions on @xmath0 with no critical points is uniformly dense in the space of all continuous , real - valued functions on @xmath0 .",
    "this result can be included in our main theorem which also applies to higher order of differentiability . before stating our main theorem , recall that a norm @xmath39 in a banach space @xmath0 is lur ( locally uniformly rotund @xcite ) if @xmath40 whenever the sequence @xmath41 and the point @xmath42 are included in the unit sphere of the norm @xmath39 and @xmath43 .",

    "i ) _ a special construction of carefully perturbed partitions of unity in an open subset of the unit sphere of the banach space @xmath48 by means of a sequence of linear functionals in @xmath49 , _ ii ) _ the study and use of the properties of the range of the derivative of the norm in @xmath24 , @xmath49 and their finite dimensional subspaces ( lemmas [ case n ] and [ vectoradicional ] below ) , and _",
    "iii ) _ the use of @xmath10 deleting diffeomorphisms from @xmath0 onto @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a bounded , closed , convex subset of @xmath0 .",
    "the following example gives the optimal order of smoothness of the approximation functions with no critical points for @xmath52 and @xmath37 .",
    "[ example ] it follows immediately from theorem [ approximation theorem ] that one can approximate every continuous , real - valued function on @xmath53 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 )  with @xmath54 smooth , real - valued functions with no critical points , where  @xmath55 $ ]  if @xmath56 is not an integer ,  @xmath57  if @xmath56 is an odd integer , and  @xmath58   if @xmath56 is an even integer .",

    "since every banach space with separable dual admits an equivalent lur and @xmath3 smooth norm @xcite , we immediately deduce from theorem [ approximation theorem ] the announced characterization of the property of approximation by @xmath3 smooth functions with no critical points .",

    "next , we establish a similar statement for higher order smoothness on separable banach spaces with a @xmath10 smooth bump function ( @xmath59 ) and unconditional basis .",
    "we combine theorem [ approximation theorem ] and the results on fine approximation given in @xcite , to obtain the optimal order of smoothness of the approximating functions with no critical points on a large class within the banach spaces with separable dual .",
