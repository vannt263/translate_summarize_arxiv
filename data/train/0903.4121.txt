    "the study of effective permittivity of heterogeneous systems holds an important position in various fields of physics and technics , for its results find wide - spread applications in composite material engineering , biochemical technology , medical diagnostics , etc . in theoretical research",
    ", the simplest and much discussed model considers a heterogeneous system as a mixture of fine particles of the disperse phase embedded into a continuous host medium .",
    "the development of it began with the case of dilute mixtures of small spherical inclusions more than century ago @xcite and has resulted , in particular , in the classical maxwell - garnett ( mg ) mixing rule and its various modifications ( see ref .",
    "for an analysis of relevant physical concepts and ideas from a historical perspective , and refs .   for a review of major results ) .",
    "it has been shown so far that : ( 1 ) the mg formula can incorporate multiple scattering effects ( see , for instance , analytical results @xcite obtained in the quasistatic limit within a mean - field approximation ) .",
    "( 2 ) for certain configurations of the disperse particles , it remains accurate for high - concentrated mixtures , @xcite in which strong electromagnetic interaction is significant and for which another  the bruggeman mixing rule @xcite  is often believed to be superior to the former .",
    "the case of mixtures of anisotropic particles remains little - investigated ( see reviews , @xcite after whose appearance the state of the art has not changed much ) .",
    "as far as we know , the existing attempts at taking the particles anisotropy into account usually reduce to or heavily rely on different kinds of one - particle approximations , including their combinations ( see , for instance , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "a typical example of such approximations is the use of the one - particle polarizability , describing the response of a solitary particle to a uniform electric field , instead of the effective polarizability of the particle in the mixture .",
    "it is evident that such an approach is tolerable only for diluted gases of anisotropic particles . in sufficiently concentrated mixtures , both multiple polarization effects and",
    "many - particle correlations in positions and orientations of the particles come into play . as a result ,",
    "finding the effective polarizability becomes a many - particle problem , which is equivalent to the original problem of finding the effective permittivity of the mixture .",
    "correspondingly , neither the effective polarizability as a function of the dielectric and geometric parameters of disperse particle , nor the interrelation of the two factors of anisotropy of the particles  nonsphericity of the shape and anisotropy of the substance  can be determined consistently within a one - particle approximation .",
    "yet we are unaware of any practically important attempts at approaching these problems using the methods of multiple - scattering theory ( in contrast to the case of spherical inclusions , for which see review , @xcite key works , @xcite and refs .  ) .",
    "this fact is readily explained by the lack of knowledge of an infinite set of the correlation functions for concentrated systems of anisotropic particle . even if such information were available , practical calculations would be extremely difficult and would probably be limited to estimations of several corrections to the born approximation .",
    "recently , @xcite we proposed a new approach to analysis of the long - wavelength value of the effective permittivity of finely dispersed mixtures .",
    "the idea was to avoid excessive theoretical refining on polarization and correlation processes that occur within the system on particle - size and interparticle - distance scales by averaging their contributions out over macroscopic regions reproducing the properties of the entire system .",
    "the appropriate procedure is based upon the notion of macroscopic compact groups of particles and the averaging @xcite of fields over volumes much greater than the typical scales of these groups . by applying it , we carried out @xcite a rigorous analysis of the effective permittivity of a concentrated mixture of spherically symmetric dielectric balls with piecewise - continuous radial permittivity profile . later ,",
    "@xcite the method was applied to systems comprising nonspherical inclusions with scalar permittivity .",
    "it was also shown that both the mg and bruggeman mixing rules can be reconstructed with it .    in the present report ,",
    "approach @xcite is developed for macroscopically homogeneous and isotopic mixtures of anisotropic dielectric particles whose dielectric properties are described by permittivity tensors and which are embedded in a host medium with constant scalar permittivity ; the particles are assumed to be hard , measurable , and , in general , inhomogeneous .",
    "it is shown that the averaged contributions from all - order reemission and short - range correlation effects within such a system can be effectively summed up . as a result",
    ", the effective static permittivity of the system is obtained as an explicit function of the parameters of the model .",
    "it can be given the form of the lorentz - lorenz type , the polarization properties of the particles being characterized by their effective polarizabilities in the mixture .",
    "the latter are found via the geometric and dielectric parameters of the particles and the host medium ; as an example , a mixture of particles of the ellipsoidal shape is considered in detail .",
    "finally , bruggeman - type formulas are shown to follow from the general formulas under special choices of the effective medium , and the ranges of validity of the results obtained are discussed .",
    "to begin with , we consider the problem on propagation of electromagnetic waves in a finely dispersed mixture with local permittivity @xmath0 . here , @xmath1 is the permittivity of the host medium and @xmath2 is the contribution caused by compact groups of the disperse anisotropic particles . by a compact group",
    "we understand any macroscopic region within which all interparticle distances @xmath3 are small as compared to the wavelength of the probing wave in the mixture : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the wave vector of the wave in vacuum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "homogenization of a mixture in terms of compact groups , viewed as macroscopic many - particle regions with linear sizes @xmath6 much less than the wavelength @xmath7 of probing radiation.,width=226 ]    according to ref .",
    ", we expect that it is multiple reemission and short - range correlation effects within such groups that form the effective permittivity of the mixture in the static limit @xmath8 , where even quite large groups of disperse particles become compact .",
    "with respect to an external static field , such groups can actually be treated as point - like ; fluctuations of macroscopically large numbers of particles contained in them , as well as correlations between the groups , can be ignored .",
    "correspondingly , the deviation @xmath2 of the local permittivity in the mixture from the permittivity of the host due to the presence at the point @xmath9 of a compact group of @xmath10 identical disperse particles , occupying measurable regions @xmath11 with individual volumes @xmath12 , can be modelled as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the deviation of the local permittivity in the mixture from the permittivity of the host due to the presence of the @xmath7th particle at @xmath9 , @xmath15 stands for the permittivity tensor of the substance of this particle , @xmath16 is the characteristic function of the region @xmath11 [ @xmath17 if @xmath18 and @xmath19 otherwise ] , and @xmath20 is the kronecker delta . in",
    "what follows , the tensors @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 will also be designated as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the equation for the @xmath27 component of the electric field of a wave in the mixture can be written as @xcite @xmath28 henceforth , the dummy suffix convention applies .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) is equivalent to the integral equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath27 component of the incident wave field in the mixture , @xmath31 is the @xmath27 component of the field amplitude @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the components of the electromagnetic field propagator [ green s tensor for eq .",

    "now , under the suggestions made , we can prove quantitatively the following two statements : ( 1 ) in the limiting case @xmath44 , the values @xmath45 and @xmath46 are determined only by the multiple reemission and short - range correlation effects inside compact groups .",

    "this replacement simply reflects the fact that within a macroscopic approach , the specified contributions are formed by those ranges of the integration variables where the electromagnetic field propagators reveal a singular behavior .",
    "our proof uses the representation @xcite @xmath52 for the propagator @xmath53 , which is valid ( see ref .   for mathematical details ) on a set of scalar , compactly supported , and bounded functions @xmath54 in the sense that there holds the relation @xmath55 in eq .",

    "the one - point correlators are equal to linear combinations of expressions constructed of kronecker deltas and satisfying certain symmetry constraints on permutations of their indices .",
    "in particular , the average @xmath75 is symmetric with respect to permutations @xmath76 , the average @xmath77 is symmetric with respect to permutations @xmath78 , @xmath79 of individual indices and permutations @xmath80 of their pairs , etc .",

    "\\(2 ) that fact that mixing rules of both types are obtainable ( under appropriate approximations ) within a single formalism is taken by us as strong evidence of the validity of basic relations ( [ eq : eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) .",
    "if this is really the case , much emphasis in further effective permittivity studies should be put on modelling , in terms of the permittivity distribution , of the structure and dielectric properties of the constituents of a real mixture .",
    "deviations of these properties from those of isolated constituents should manifest themselves as deviations from the classical mixing rules and their modifications obtained in the present work .",
    "\\(3 ) the averages in eqs .  ( [ eq : eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) are in fact statistical , according to the analysis in section  [ sec : basic ] . consequently ,",
    "( [ eq : eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) can be used to develop a statistical theory of effective permittivity . in particular , proceeding in this way and using the general properties of particle distribution functions for macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic systems of balls , one can infer that it is the hardness of the balls that lies at the heart of the classical mg mixing rule .",
