    "as realized by many authors , the fireball of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may contain significant neutron component in essentially all progenitor scenarios ( e.g. , derishev , kocharovsky @xmath7 kocharovsky 1999a , b ; beloborodov 2003a ) .",
    "the dynamics as well as the observable signatures ( the neutrino emission from the proton - neutron decoupling and the changes in grb lightcurves due to neutrons preceding the ion shell or catching up it ) of a relativistic neutron - rich fireball have been investigated by derishev , kocharovsky @xmath7 kocharovsky ( 1999a , b ) firstly . since then , many authors have had their attention on the neutron - fed grbs . if the neutron abundance is comparable to that of proton , the inelastic collision between differentially streaming protons and neutrons in the fireball will provide us observable 5 - 10 gev neutrinos ( bachall & mszros 2000 , hereafter bm00 ; mszros & rees 2000 ) .",
    "the baryon - loading problem in grb models can be ameliorated if significant fraction of baryons confined in the fireball are converted to neutrons ( fuller , pruet @xmath7 abazajian 2000 ) .",
    "further investigations on the observation implications have been presented in pruet @xmath7 dalal ( 2002 , hereafter pd02 ) and beloborodov ( 2003b , hereafter b03 ) . in pd02 , the short grbs are assumed to be powered by external shocks and the neutron component lags behind the ion one . as the ion ejecta has been decelerated significantly by the external medium , the decayed neutron ejecta catches up the decelerated ion ejecta and powers kev emission . in b03 ,",
    "the neutron - ejecta keeps ahead the ion - ejecta .",
    "the @xmath1decay ( @xmath8 ) products share their momentum with the external medium immediately . as a result",
    ", the external medium have been accelerated to a ultra - relativistic velocity .",
    "the interaction between the ion ejecta and the accelerated medium is much different from the usual case ( i.e. , a fireball ejecta interacting with the static medium ) .",
    "so the presence of neutron ejecta qualitatively changes the early dynamical evolution of grbs remnant .    in pd02 and b03 ,",
    "only the `` fast '' neutron component has been taken into account .",
    "in fact , the long , complex grbs are more likely to be powered by the interaction of shells with variant lfs , i.e. , the internal shocks model ( paczyski & xu 1994 ; rees & mszros 1994 ) .",
    "the best fit to the multi - wavelength afterglows implies that a significant fraction of the initial kinetic energy has been converted into internal energy ( panaitescu @xmath7 kumar 2002 ) , which requires that the difference in velocities between the shells is significant ( i.e. , the corresponding lfs satisfy @xmath9 ) and their masses are comparable ( @xmath10 ) ( piran 1999 , hereafter p99 ) [ throughout this work , the subscript @xmath11 represent the fast / slow shells respectively ; @xmath12 represent the neutron / proton component respectively ] .",
    "typically , @xmath13 is in order of tens , and @xmath14 is in order of hundreds .",
    "thus , for the slow shell , the n , p component coast with @xmath15 since @xmath16^{-1/4}$ ] ( bm00 ) , where @xmath17 being the total luminosity of the ejecta , @xmath18 being the radius of the central engine , @xmath19 being the ratio of the neutrons to the protons contained in the shells . in this letter , we adopt the convention @xmath20 for expressing the physical parameters , using cgs units . for the fast shell , the n , p components move with different lfs : @xmath21 since generally @xmath22 ( bm00 ) . in the internal shocks phase",
    ", the fast ion shell catches the slower but earlier one at a radius @xmath23 and forms a new one moving with a lf @xmath24 ( hereafter the formed `` new '' shell is named as the `` i - shell '' ) . at @xmath25 , the @xmath1decay of the neutron component",
    "is far from important unless the typical variability timescale is longer than 0.1 s ( see rossi , beloborodov & rees 2004 for more information ) .    as the duration of grb is long enough ,",
    "the much later ejected i - shell catches up the earlier slow neutron shell ( hereafter , the `` n - shell '' ) at @xmath26 , where @xmath27 being the ejection time - lag of the earlier slow n - shell and the later i - shell ; on the other hand , the @xmath1decay radius of slow neutrons reads @xmath28 , at which slow neutrons have decayed significantly . as long as @xmath29 is comparable with @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31",
    ", the decayed products of earlier but slower ejected neutron shells will be swept orderly by the later ejected ion shells in a range @xmath32 .",
    "the possible emission signature powered by that interaction is of our interest in this letter .",
    "otherwise , for grbs much shorter than @xmath33 , the last i - shell crosses the first slow n - shell at a radius @xmath34 , where the @xmath1decay is unimportant and there is no observable signature .",
    "even for a neutron - free internal shocks model , the practical lf distribution of shells involved is far from clear so far , let alone say the neutron - rich one . here",
    "we use an approximate model proposed by guetta , spada @xmath7 waxman ( 2001 ) , in which the lfs of i - shells are drawn from a bimodal distribution , @xmath35 or @xmath36 , with equal probability . that simple model is favored by its relative high energy conversion efficiency and peak energy . in this letter , mainly for simplicity , we make the following assumptions : ( i ) @xmath37 , and the ratios between the mass of the fast neutrons , slow neutrons and i - shells are 1:1:2 .",
    "( ii ) each fast ( slow ) neutron / ion shell moves with a same lf @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) respectively . after the merger of a pair of fast / slow ion shells , the resulting i - shell moves with @xmath42 . (",
    "iii ) the energetic ejecta are expanding into the low density interstellar medium ( ism ) , which is the case for most grbs ( panaitescu @xmath7 kumar 2002 ) .",
    "( iv ) the duration of the grb is longer than @xmath43 since the constraint @xmath44  should be satisfied .",
    "the @xmath1decay radius of fast neutrons @xmath45 is much larger than @xmath30 .",
    "we ignore them since for @xmath46 , there is only a small fraction of fast neutrons decayed .",
    "the ism has been swept by the early and fast ions as well as the decayed products of fast neutrons , so the decay products of slow neutrons move freely .    assuming that at radius @xmath47 , the @xmath48th i - shell crosses the @xmath49th slow n - shell ( @xmath50 ) . at radius @xmath51 , the @xmath52th i - shell will catch up the @xmath49th slow n - shell , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 being the typical variability timescale of grbs . for the @xmath49th n - shell ,",
    "the products of slow neutrons decayed at radius @xmath56 have been carried away by i - shells ejected early than the @xmath52th one .",
    "hence the mass swept by @xmath52th i - shell is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the the initial rest mass of the n - shell .",
    "so the averaged comoving number density of proton ( due to @xmath1decay ) swept by @xmath52th i - shell can be estimated by @xmath60    notice that in front of the much later ejected i - shells , there are hundreds of decaying n - shells . with assumptions made before , the whole process of each i - shell interacting with these decaying n - shells is rather similar . for convenience , in our following treatment ,",
    "the discrete interaction of each i - shell with these decaying n - shells has been simplified as an i - shell sweeping a moving proton trail ( the lf of which is @xmath61 ) with a number density @xmath62 continually .",
    "the dynamics of that interaction can be described by the shock model as follows : now the trail is moving with a lf @xmath63 , the generated thermal energy ( comoving frame ) in the shock front satisfies @xmath64 ( e.g. , b03 ) rather than @xmath65 ; where @xmath66 being the lf of the decelerating i - shell ( the lf of which is @xmath67 ) relative to the trail ; @xmath68 and @xmath69 being the corresponding velocity of @xmath67 and @xmath61 ; the mass swept by the i - shell reads @xmath70 after some simple algebra , the energy conservation of the system ( the decelerating i - shell and the swept slow neutron trail ) yields @xmath71 where @xmath72 being the rest mass of the i - shell ; @xmath73 being the radiation efficiency of the shock . for @xmath74 , equation ( [ dynamics ] )",
    "reduces to the familiar form @xmath75 ( p99 ) .    in the downstream ,",
    "the electrons have been heated by the shock . as usual",
    "( e.g. , p99 ) , we assume that the shocked electrons distribute as @xmath76 for @xmath77 , where @xmath78 being the typical power law index , @xmath79 ; @xmath80 and @xmath81 being the fractions of the shock energy given to electrons and the random magnetic field at shock , respectively . the comoving downstream magnetic field @xmath82 . as shown in p99 , there is a critical lf , above which synchrotron radiation is significant : @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is determined by @xmath85 ( @xmath86 being the observer time , @xmath87 being the red - shift of grbs ) , @xmath88 being the thomson cross section , @xmath89 being the compton parameter ( e.g. , wei & lu 1998 , 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ) : @xmath90 , where @xmath91 being the radiation coefficient of electrons , so @xmath92 . for @xmath93 ( fast cooling ) , @xmath94 ; for @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( slow cooling ) .    given a proper boundary condition , equation ( [ dynamics ] ) can be easily solved . with resulting @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ", we can calculate the typical synchrotron radiation frequency @xmath100 ( @xmath101 being the charge of electron ) , the cooling frequency @xmath102 and the self - absorption frequency @xmath103 ( the detailed calculation on @xmath103 can be found in the appendix of wu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) , with which we can analytically calculate the synchrotron radiation flux at the fixed band .",
    "the numerical results for these typical frequencies have been plotted in figure [ frequency ] , where the parameters are taken as : @xmath104 , which is corresponding to a luminosity @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 ; @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ frequency ] , at the early time , the electrons are usually in fast cooling case and @xmath103 is above the optical band . lately , the electrons are in slow cooling case and @xmath103 drops to @xmath113 ( currently , the observed emission are coming from hundreds of i - shells interacting with the slow neutrons trail . for the same reason , in our estimating the self - absorption frequency , the total number of electrons contributed has been assumed to be @xmath114 times that of one trail .",
    "in fact , if just an i - shell interacting with the slow neutron trail has been taken into account , @xmath103 should be one order or more less than the value presented here ) .",
    "the synchrotron flux as a function of observer frequency can be approximated as follows : in the case of fast cooling ( just for @xmath115 . for @xmath116",
    ", please refer to eqs .",
    "( 4 - 5 ) of zhang & mszros ( 2004 ) ) , @xmath117    in the case of slow cooling @xmath118    approximately , @xmath119 , @xmath120 being a function of @xmath121 ( for @xmath78 , @xmath122 ) ; @xmath123 being the number of electrons involved in the emission , @xmath124 being the luminosity distance ( wijers & galama 1999 ) .",
    "the upcoming satellite swift carries three telescopes : the burst alert telescope ( bat ) , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , the ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot ) .",
    "the energy range of xrt is 0.2 - 10 kev .",
    "uvot covers 170nm-650 nm with six colors .",
    "so in figure [ lightcurve ] we calculate the emission at the observer frequency @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the synchrotron radiation of an i - shell interacting with the trail as a function of the observer time has been shown in figure [ lightcurve ] .",
    "what we observed is the emission comes from a series ( several thousand ) of i - shells interacting with the trail of slow neutrons rather than just from one . in the simplest model proposed here , @xmath127 sample light curves overlap , each with a @xmath128 delay .",
    "the resulting net observable fluxes at @xmath129 and 5kev are about @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively .",
    "the signature of 5kev emission is only marginal since the typical x - ray component during many grbs is strong , too .",
    "so we do not discuss it any longer .",
    "the sensitivity of uvot is about 19th magnitude in a 10-s exposure .",
    "the spacecraft s time - to - target is about 20@xmath13270 seconds , in principle , part of , if not all the emission predicted here can be detected in the near future .",
    "however , we need to investigate whether some other emissions during prompt @xmath6ray emission phase can dominate over the emissions predicted here or not .",
    "recently , it is suggested that the relativistic @xmath133 pair generated in the internal shocks phase can power a uv flash @xmath134 magnitude , too ( fan & wei 2004 ) .",
    "but the actual value of that emission is proportional to @xmath135^{5/2}$ ] , and in that work the fiducial value for these parameters are taken as @xmath114 and @xmath136 respectively . if @xmath137 or smaller , as taken in this work , the uv flash predicted in fan & wei ( 2004 ) will be much weaker ( @xmath138 magnitude ) unless @xmath139 is much larger than 300 .",
    "thus the uv emission predicted in this work can be detected independently .",
    "in the standard baryonic internal shocks model for gamma - ray bursts ( paczyski & xu 1994 ; rees & mszros 1994 ) , the prompt @xmath6ray emission are powered by the interaction between ion shells with variable lfs . if these shells are neutron rich , the neutron component coupled with the ",
    "fast ions  is accelerated to a larger bulk lf ( @xmath140 ) , i.e. , the fast neutron component , which is the focus of many publications ( e.g. , pd02 , b03 ) .",
    "however , the neutron component coupled with the `` slow ions '' can only be accelerated to a moderate bulk lf @xmath0 , for which the typical @xmath1decay radius @xmath141 is significantly smaller than that of the fast neutrons .",
    "as long as the duration of grb is long enough , the earlier n - shells will be swept by the much later i - shells successively till the radius @xmath142 , where the slow neutrons have decayed significantly .",
    "consequently the interaction may power observable emission .    in this letter , with an extremely simplified model to describe the later but faster i - shells interacting with the much early but slow ,",
    "decaying n - shells , we have shown that there comes a @xmath14312th magnitude uv flash at the later time of long grbs . that emission is bright enough to be detected by the upcoming satellite swift in the near future .",
    "the emission predicted here is independent on the poorly known medium distribution around the progenitor of grbs , as long as it is not very dense ; it is also independent of some other physical processes , such as the @xmath133 pair emission ( fan & wei 2004 ) , the possible reverse shock emission ( as usual , if we assume the number density of interstellar medium ( ism ) is about @xmath144 , @xmath145 is much smaller than the deceleration radius @xmath146 , at which about half of the kinetic energy of the ejecta has been converted into the thermal energy of the shocked ism , for a neutron - free ejecta ) and so on .",
    "the resulting net light - curve in this work increases rapidly firstly .",
    "then there comes a flat lasting @xmath147 , the duration of corresponding grb .",
    "finally , the light - curve drops sharply , where the observed emission are mainly contributed by the `` equal - arriving surface '' effect ( e.g. , kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; fan , wei & wang 2004 ) , if other emission such as the reverse shock emission has not been taken into account .",
    "it should be noted that the model taken here is a great simplification of the real situation , in which both the ion / neutron shells are moving with variable lfs , it is natural to expect that the corresponding emission is variable with time , too .",
    "however , to simulate such complicate processes is far beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "nonetheless , the actual flux may not be far dimmer than our prediction since averagely speaking , the lfs of the slow n - shells and the i - shells are significantly different , but their masses are comparable .",
    "so the interaction of them can power a bright uv flash in the range @xmath148 .",
