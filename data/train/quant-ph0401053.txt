    "the recent algorithm of ambainis @xcite which exploits properties of quantum walks on versions of johnson graphs opens up a new avenue for walk based algorithm designs .",
    "it claims as its direct predecessor the algorithm of grover @xcite for database search .",
    "ambainis s algorithm , like @xcite , is a search algorithm , but for many problems to which it applies , such as element distinctness , it runs quicker than any application of @xcite . in the present article",
    "we give a thorough analysis of the type of walks that power the construction in @xcite , and use them in a very general algorithmic scheme . in our efforts to simplify the proofs we modify the paradigm that grover has set up .",
    "ambainis s idea that a quantum walk can accelerate black box search for pairs of colliding elements demonstrates that diffusion - based quantum walks are more versatile than it had been thought previously .",
    "the consequences are numerous . based on it magniez , santha and szegedy @xcite give a quicker algorithm for the oracle version of the triangle finding problem .",
    "childs and eisenberg @xcite streamline the analysis of @xcite , and give further examples to its use .",
    "these papers , even the latter one do not change the proof structure of @xcite significantly .",
    "in contrast , our discussion departs from that of @xcite at several points : 1 .",
    "we treat not only the johnson graphs but all markov chains ; 2 .",
    "we show how to eliminate the restriction ambainis imposes on the state of the machine : we no longer need to request that it stays in a constant dimensional subspace of the entire state space .",
    "we circumvent relevant parts of the proof by introducing `` memory '' for walks . as a consequence of 1 . , 2 . , and 3 .",
    "we obtain :    let @xmath0 be a symmetric markov chain with transition probabilities @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2)$ ] .",
    "some elements of the state space are marked .",
    "we are promised that the set of marked elements has size either zero or at least @xmath3 .",
    "the goal is to find out with great certainty which of the above two cases holds .",
    "our model is a black box that can answer certain yes / no questions and can generate random elements picked from certain distributions .",
    "more specifically , by request the black box can give us a uniformly distributed random element for the cost of @xmath4 .",
    "also , when `` inserting '' an element @xmath5 into the black box we can obtain a random element @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is distributed according to @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "the cost of the latter operation is @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we can use the black box to test if an element @xmath5 is marked , and this costs us @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 is the eigenvalue gap of @xmath0 , there is a simple classical algorithm with cost @xmath10 that solves the above promise problem .",
    "( the algorithm is efficient if @xmath4 is much larger than @xmath11 . ) in contrast , we show that for the `` quantized '' version of the algorithm it costs only @xmath12 to solve the problem .",
    "we refer to this as the @xmath13 rule . among the technical contributions we give a formula for the spectrum of the product of two general reflections .",
    "we settle at a walk model , directly derived from @xcite , that we call `` bipartite . ''",
    "we focus only on walks that do diffusion for coin flip .",
    "our formulas for the spectra and the eigenvalues of these walks should be useful in other contexts as well .    in the quantum walk literature one can find two separate directions .",
    "_ discrete _ time walks were introduced by y. aharonov , l. davidovich , and n. zagury @xcite and re - introduced by d. a. meyer @xcite .",
    "the properties of these walks were studied in one dimension by ambainis , e. bach , a. nayak , a. vishwanath , and j. watrous : @xcite , and in general by d. aharonov , a. ambainis , j. kempe , u. vazirani @xcite .",
    "_ continuous _ time walks were introduced by e. farhi , s. gutmann @xcite , and they were studied by j. roland , n. cerf @xcite , by wim van dam , michele mosca , umesh v. vazirani @xcite , by childs and goldstone @xcite and many others .",
    "andrew m. childs , richard cleve , enrico deotto , edward farhi , sam gutmann , daniel a. spielman @xcite show an example where a continuous quantum walk exponentially quicker traverses a graph than its deterministic counterpart .",
    "continuous walks are intimately related to the paradigm of adiabatic computation .",
    "in this article we are concerned about special discrete time walks .",
    "the results are self - contained .",
    "we develop notations for bipartite objects , both classical and quantum .",
    "the symbol @xmath14 denotes a _ left_-set of size @xmath15 and symbol @xmath16 $ ] denotes a _ right_-set of size @xmath17 .",
    "a classical bipartite walk takes place on the node set @xmath18 $ ] :       let @xmath19 be the quantized version of this bipartite chain . by theorem [ mainth ] the busy subspace of @xmath19 has eigenvectors : @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the latter coincides with @xmath22 . representing these as rectangular vectors :",
    "@xmath23 one can compute that @xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent with theorem [ normth ] , since the squared norm of @xmath25 is 2 , and theorem [ normth ] implies that the squared norms of @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be obtained from the norm of @xmath25 by scaling it with the factor @xmath28 . theorem [ mainth ]",
    "gives that the eigenvalues associated with @xmath26 , @xmath29 and @xmath27 are @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "what makes grover s algorithm work is that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "our version of grover s algorithm ( section [ memorysec ] ) uses the initial state @xmath35 this is the state we can easily produce ( in the query model without cost , in the circuit model with small cost ) .",
    "notice that @xmath36 has a large component in the space spanned by @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "define @xmath37 then @xmath38 this again , should not surprise us because of equation ( [ componenteq ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath39 and our analysis of algorithm findmarked(@xmath40 ) can go on like in the previous section .",
    "the goal of the present article is exactly to show how to shortcut much of the calculations we have made in this section ."
