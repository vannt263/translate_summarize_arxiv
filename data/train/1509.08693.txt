    "the vacuum breakdown in external electric fields by the emission of the lightest charged particle - antiparticle pairs ( schwinger effect ) is an unobserved prediction of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite . until recently",
    ", this pair production mechanism seemed to be a mere academic problem owing to the required electric field strength of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "recent efforts have raised the hopes that a direct observation might become feasible at ultra - high intensity laser facilities @xcite .",
    "alternatively , there have been suggestions to study the schwinger effect in graphene @xcite or to quantum simulate it in analogue cold atom systems @xcite .    the pair production problem in qed",
    "can not be solved in full glory but requires an approximate treatment .",
    "assuming ultra - high intensity lasers , it is well - justified to neglect quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and to treat it as a classical , external one .",
    "in addition , since the spatio - temporal laser scales are orders of magnitude different from the qed scale , which is set by the electron mass @xmath1 , the focal region is typically modeled by a spatially homogeneous , time - dependent electric field . in this case , quantum kinetic equations are especially well - suited to study the pair production problem numerically since they can be formulated as a coupled system of ordinary first - order differential equations @xcite , which can be solved very efficiently . for more complicated field configurations including spatial inhomogeneities or non - vanishing magnetic fields , more sophisticated approaches such as worldline methods @xcite , the dirac - heisenberg - wigner formalism @xcite or methods from real - time lattice gauge theory @xcite have been employed .",
    "it has been proposed to lower the threshold for pair production by superimposing electric fields with different frequencies ( dynamically - assisted schwinger effect ) @xcite and the resulting momentum spectra have been investigated .",
    "several studies revealed a very rich structure of the momentum distribution , owing to the fact that the pair - production problem depends non - linearly on the applied field profile .",
    "in fact , certain characteristic features of the momentum distribution were interpreted in terms of symmetries of the electric field and resonance conditions @xcite .",
    "however , it is almost impossible to predict the variations in the momentum spectrum upon changing the field parameters _ a priori _ ,",
    "i.e.  without actually solving the dynamic equations . a rare exception are solitonic fields , for which particle production can be excluded at one predetermined momentum mode @xcite .    from an experimental point of view",
    ", we have to face the challenge that the number of produced electron - positron pairs is exponentially small and therefore hard to discriminate from background noise .",
    "moreover , spectrometers are only sensitive in a certain momentum window and characterized by a finite momentum resolution .",
    "accordingly , it would be most beneficial to generate electric field configurations such that the momentum distribution is peaked in a characteristic momentum window in order to enhance the detection probability .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the inverse scattering problem in quantum mechanics where asymptotic scattering data is used to reconstruct the scattering potential @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we present a method to solve the inverse problem for schwinger pair production , i.e.  we determine the field parameters resulting in a predetermined momentum distribution , by combining quantum kinetic theory with optimal control theory .",
    "we employ optimization techniques which have been utilized previously in performing pulse - shape optimization for pair production @xcite , and which have also proven successful in the closely related field of atomic , molecular and optical physics @xcite .",
    "motivated by advances in high harmonic and attosecond pulse generation @xcite , we superimpose a small number of harmonic components and optimize their amplitudes such that a predetermined momentum distribution is well - approximated . in the long run , our results could be used for tailoring superpositions of high harmonics in order to maximize the detection probability in a given momentum window . on the other hand ,",
    "a measured momentum distribution could also serve as a tomograph of the laser field , which is hard to control in an absolute manner at ultra - high intensities .",
    "vacuum electron - positron production in a unidirectional time - dependent electric field @xmath2 can be described in terms of a quasi - particle distribution function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the momentum variable with components along and perpendicular to the field direction , and @xmath5 denotes time . given a finite time interval @xmath6 $ ] with @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath8 can be regarded as the momentum distribution of asymptotic particles @xcite . defining auxiliary functions",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 , its dynamics is governed by the coupled system of ordinary first - order differential equations @xcite    [ eq : eom ] @xmath11 - 2\\omega h \\ , \\\\   & \\dot{h}&\\ = \\ & 2\\omega g \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with initial values @xmath12 . for @xmath13 and @xmath14",

    "we take a superposition of @xmath17 harmonic components on the time interval @xmath6 $ ]    [ eq : fields ] @xmath18 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    such that @xmath7 and @xmath19 .",
    "we then mean to select the field amplitudes @xmath20 such that a predetermined distribution function @xmath21 is obtained at the final time @xmath22 .",
    "while this search could be achieved by brute force for a very small number of harmonics , this approach becomes practically unfeasible for larger values of @xmath17 .",
    "hence we set up an optimization problem to solve this inverse problem for schwinger pair production by defining the cost functional as the least square deviation of @xmath8 from the objective distribution @xmath21 : @xmath23=\\frac{\\int{[dq ] \\left[f(q , t)-f_0(q)\\right]^2}}{\\int{[dq ] f_0 ^ 2(q ) } } \\ .\\ ] ] the global minimum of the cost functional in the space @xmath24 spanned by the field amplitudes is then defined as @xmath25 } \\ .\\ ] ] for reasons which will become clear later , the cost functional will also be denoted as quality factor in the following .",
    "we emphasize that the distribution function @xmath8 implicitly depends on the field amplitudes @xmath26 via the dynamical system .",
    "the constrained optimization problem can be recast in an unconstrained optimization problem by introducing lagrange multiplier functions @xmath27 @xcite , which need to obey the adjoint equations    [ eq : adj ] @xmath28    with final values @xmath29 and @xmath30/\\int{[dq]f_0 ^ 2(q)}$ ] .",

    "we emphasize that it is only guaranteed for infinite sample sizes that the global minimum @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 denotes the global minimizer configuration , is among the detected stationary points @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also not guaranteed that an exact solution of the inverse problem , which is characterized by a vanishing cost functional @xmath45 , actually exists . in general , we will rather find @xmath46 for certain momenta , where @xmath47 denotes the momentum distribution corresponding to the global minimum @xmath48 .",
    "this is in fact a sign that the inverse problem for schwinger pair production is in general ill - posed @xcite .",
    "a configuration that approaches the exact solution to the inverse problem is characterized by @xmath49 , and we will study its dependence on the number of harmonic components @xmath17 in the following .     3d - plot of the quality factor landscape for a superposition of @xmath50 harmonics . for display reasons we show @xmath51 $ ] , so that local maxima in the plot actually correspond to local minima of @xmath52 $ ] . in green",

    "[ fig2:quality ] , where we display the quality factor @xmath48 as a function of @xmath17 .",

    "[ fig3:optimization_dist ] . based on our result",
    ", we note that the average number of required iteration steps grows like @xmath78 , indicating that the simulations become more expensive for increasing @xmath17 .",

    ", the optimal distribution @xmath88 approximates the objective distribution @xmath21 better and better . here , we emphasize that the global minimum configuration @xmath88 does not necessarily arise from the global minimum configurations @xmath89 , meaning that @xmath90 does not necessarily lie in the basin of attraction of @xmath91 .",

    "the number of harmonics @xmath17 needs to be further increased in order to approach the exact solution of the inverse problem for schwinger pair production .",
    "quantitatively , we find that the quality factor drops from @xmath102 to @xmath103 . based on our results ,",
    "the functional dependence of the quality factor is reasonably well - described by an exponential function @xmath72 .",
    "one may therefore speculate that there is an exact solution of the inverse problem for the chosen objective distribution @xmath21 .",
    "it is , however , not clear whether this solution then exists for finite @xmath17 or only in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "we already mentioned that the employed multi - start method is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum only for infinite sample sizes .",
    "accordingly , fig .",
    "[ fig2:quality ] is to be considered as an upper limit whereas there are , in principle , even better configurations conceivable . in the current study , we have used @xmath74 random initial configurations @xmath37 for all considered values of @xmath17 .",
