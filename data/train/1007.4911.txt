    "dust agglomeration , also known as dust aggregation or dust coagulation , is a process of sticking dust particles together after their collision @xcite .",
    "this process occurs in very different environments and plays an important role in colloid chemistry @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , atmospheric physics @xcite , fusion physics @xcite as well as plasma physics @xcite .",
    "nano / microparticles trapped in a low - temperature plasma are normally charged negatively due to high electron mobility @xcite , which results in the mutual repulsion between them .",
    "agglomeration of nanoparticles in plasmas  the major mechanism operating during the so - called `` rapid growth '' ( rg ) phase @xcite  has been observed in numerous experiments @xcite . at the rg stage ,",
    "most of nanoparticles are neutral , some carry several electron charges , even fewer are charged positively @xcite , and therefore the charge discreteness plays very important role .",
    "the agglomeration criteria for such particles were derived theoretically , based on either the polarization - induced ion flux asymmetry model @xcite or the shadow attraction due to neutral / plasma particle bombardment @xcite .",
    "the agglomeration of nanoparticles in a plasma has been reported for sizes up to several hundreds of nm @xcite . as the size of particles immersed in a plasma increases ,",
    "their charges become more and more negative ( the charge is linearly proportional to the particle size , for a one micron particle it ranges from several hundreds to several thousands of @xmath0 , depending on discharge conditions @xcite ) . therefore , agglomeration of microparticles in a plasma has been believed so far to be practically impossible due to strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "this process was primarily studied ( both experimentally and theoretically ) in a neutral environment @xcite , showing that positive and negative charges carried by individual particles ( in overall neutral ensemble ) can enormously accelerate the agglomeration .    in this article",
    "we report on a series of experiments where dust - acoustic ( density ) waves trigger agglomeration of microparticles .",
    "we show that the agglomeration can occurs under typical discharge conditions , for particles of different sizes and materials , and the aggregates formed in a plasma can be observed _ in situ _ , using a long - distance microscope .",
    "the experiments were performed on the ground in the pk-3 plus chamber @xcite , which was originally designed for microgravity experiments onboard the international space station ( iss ) .",
    "the chamber ( which consists of two parallel electrodes driven in push - pull mode at a frequency of @xmath1 mhz ) was placed horizontally and single microparticles ( no agglomerates ) were injected into the discharge from a special dispenser . a vertical laser sheet ( perpendicular to the electrodes ) with a thickness of about @xmath2 m was used to illuminate the particles in the plasma , the scattered light was recorded at @xmath3 by a high - speed ccd camera .",
    "a detailed description of the pk-3 plus setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "microparticles were first injected into argon plasma ( typically maintained at a rf peak - to - peak voltage of @xmath4  v and gas pressure of @xmath5  pa ) , to form a stable cloud above the bottom electrode .",
    "then , in order to accelerate particles , dust - acoustic ( density ) waves were triggered in the cloud by decreasing gas pressure well below the instability threshold @xcite ( down to 1020  pa ) .",
    "this unstable regime was maintained for several minutes , and then the gas pressure was restored to the initial ( stable ) level .",
    "such experiments were performed with particles of different sizes and materials .",
    "we compared profiles of the dust clouds before and after the wave excitation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . after the excitation , we observed aggregates levitated at the bottom of the cloud ( they can be identified as brighter spots having larger distances to their neighbors ) . for sio@xmath6 particles of @xmath7",
    "m diameter ( first row ) , multiple layers of aggregates ( apparently of different sizes ) were seen after the unstable regime .",
    "the aggregates were separated from single particles by a narrow but well - seen gap , while before the wave excitation there were only a few bigger particles near the lower edge .",
    "the similar situation was also observed for melamine - formaldehyde ( mf ) particles of @xmath8 m and @xmath9 m diameter ( second and third row , respectively ) as well as for polymethyl - methacrylate ( pmma ) particles of @xmath10 m diameter ( fourth row ) .    in order to take a close look at the structure of the aggregates we used a long - distance microscope ( with a diffusive light source from the opposite side of the chamber ) , which allowed us to perform _ in situ _ observations .",
    "due to limited resolution of the microscope , we were only able to analyze the experiments with sufficiently large particles .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] : in the experiments with mf , pmma , and `` magnetic polystyrene '' @xcite ( mps ) particles of about @xmath10 m diameter ( first , second , and third row , respectively ) the aggregates were usually composed of several particles and had rather irregular ( often elongated ) structure . for larger mf particles of @xmath9 m diameter ( fourth row ) the aggregates were typically formed of two - three particles .",
    "it is noteworthy that for silver - coated polystyrene ( ps ) particles of @xmath11 m diameter ( fifth row ) the agglomeration was also possible and in fact very effective , resulting in the formation of relatively large elongated aggregates .",
    "this strongly suggests that the agglomeration of microparticles in a plasma is a quite generic phenomenon occurring both for dielectric and conductive particles .",
    "m diameter , the second row  pmma particles of @xmath10 m diameter , the third row  mps particles of @xmath10 m diameter , the fourth row  mf particles of @xmath9 m diameter , and the fifth row  silver - coated ps particles of @xmath11 m diameter .",
    "[ figure2],scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "the agglomeration in a plasma can only be achieved if heavily charged particles acquire the kinetic energy which is sufficiently high to overcome the interparticle repulsion . in our experiment ,",
    "the particles were accelerated by the dust - acoustic waves ( which were presumably triggered by the ion streaming instability @xcite ) . in order to track the individual particles inside the wave , we performed a series of experiments with mf particles of @xmath12 m diameter and recorded their motion during two seconds .",
    "we used a high - speed camera at 2000 frames per second ( fps ) with full exposure , recording the field of view of 3  mm@xmath133  mm ( at a spatial resolution of 210 pixel per mm ) .",
    "the waves propagated mostly vertically , with an average wave period of about @xmath14  ms ( at a gas pressure of @xmath15  pa ) .",
    "the waves were highly nonlinear , with a minor fraction of particles moving in one direction at rather high velocities , while most of them were moving slowly in the opposite direction . to visualize the particle trajectories ,",
    "five consecutive video frames were color - coded and overlapped , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3]a .",
    ", the scattering is shown as a sequence of five consecutive frames .",
    "the results are for mf particles of @xmath12 m diameter .",
    "[ figure3],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to analyze the agglomeration process in detail , we first have to evaluate the parameters that determine the interparticle interaction .",
    "obviously , the most critical parameter for such analysis is the charge of microparticles  if it is too high the coagulation is inhibited . a simple estimate of the charge from the orbit - motion - limited ( oml ) theory is just not possible for our conditions , since the plasma parameters in dense particle clouds are poorly known . as an alternative , we were able to derive the charge from rarely occurring _ scattering _ collisions of two particles .",
    "we supposed that the observed collision events are representative , in the sense that charges of the colliding particles are close to the mean particle charge in the whole cloud .",
    "an example of the collision event is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3]b - f . for the analysis we assumed the debye - hckel interaction potential which depends on two unknown parameters : the charge @xmath16 and the screening length @xmath17 .",
    "these parameters were derived by simulating the pair collisions and fitting the resulting trajectories to the observed ones .",
    "we took into account neutral gas friction @xcite and used the particle velocities and coordinates measured before the collision as the initial conditions .",
    "since the velocities and coordinates were naturally measured with some errors , the fittings of @xmath16 and @xmath17 was performed by varying the initial conditions within the estimated error bars .",
    "the best fit was then defined by maximizing the correlation between the simulated and measured trajectories , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "we found that the fit is practically insensible to the value of @xmath17 , apparently because the relative velocities of colliding particles were so high that the scattering mostly occurred at distances smaller than the screening length .",
    "this observation significantly simplified the subsequent analysis and allowed us to directly employ the rutherford s scattering theory @xcite .",
    "given the fact that the typical collision event is much shorter than the gas damping timescale , the charge can be obtained from the formula @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ( initial ) kinetic energy of the relative particle motion ( where @xmath20 is the mass of a single particle and @xmath21 is the relative velocity ) , @xmath22 is the scattering angle , and @xmath23 is the impact parameter for colliding particles .",
    "this yields the charge @xmath24 , where the uncertainty is given by the standard deviation averaged over ten collision events .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the actual uncertainty is somewhat larger , because the collision plane ( in the center - of - mass reference frame ) is never perfectly parallel to the illuminating laser sheet ( which has a finite thickness ) , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .    ) .",
    "one of the trajectories ( diamonds ) becomes noticeably dimmer at one end , suggesting that the scattering plane ( in the center - of - mass reference frame ) is not parallel to the illuminating laser sheet .",
    "[ figure4],scaledwidth=30.0% ]    two colliding particles can touch each other only if their relative velocity exceeds a critical ( threshold ) value determined by the coulomb repulsion . using the same assumptions as above , we readily obtain the critical velocity , @xmath25 which has the following scaling on the particle size : @xmath26 ( here we also assume @xmath27 ) . for the experiment shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] we get @xmath28 mm / s . in order to evaluate the probability for particles in the cloud to reach the critical velocity , we tracked the individual particles manually and estimated their velocities from the lengths of the trajectories at each video frame . from this analysis we deduced the _ relative velocity _ distribution ( normalized to unity ) , @xmath29 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] for different phases @xmath30 of the wave .",
    "this plot clearly demonstrates that for certain @xmath30 there is a small fraction of particles with the relative velocities exceeding @xmath31 .    using these results , we estimated the agglomeration rate for pair collisions ( per unit volume , assuming that the sticking probability upon the collision is unity ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the ( time - dependent ) particle number density in the cloud , @xmath34 is the wave period , and the collision cross section , @xmath35 is determined by the critical velocity given by eq .",
    "( [ v_cr ] ) .",
    "the calculations yield @xmath36  mm@xmath37s@xmath38 for the experiment illustrated in figs  [ figure3]-[figure5 ] . in order to compare these estimates with the experiment",
    ", we selected a part of the visible cloud ( assuming the horizontal homogeneity ) which represent a slice of the thickness @xmath39  mm ( about the thickness of the illuminating laser sheet ) , width of @xmath40 mm , and height of @xmath41 mm ( full height of the cloud ) .",
    "the number of ( double ) aggregates predicted by eq .",
    "( [ agglomeration rate ] ) to appear in this volume after five minutes of the unstable regime is @xmath42 , which is 56 times larger than the number of aggregates ( 82 ) we actually observed . taking into account that the sticking probability of the colliding particles can be substantially smaller than unity and also that the aggregates in the considered experiment consisted ( on average ) of more than two particles , we conclude that the theory provides reasonable agreement with the experiment .",
    "let us discuss the mechanisms that can effectively bind particles in a plasma .",
    "if we assume a homogeneous charge distribution over the spherical particle surfaces , the repulsive coulomb force @xmath43 between them is equivalent to that between two point charges @xmath16 located at the centers of the spheres .",
    "therefore , the force at the contact , @xmath44 does not depend on @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "the charge at one particle induces a dipole moment at another particle .",
    "this results in the attractive force which depends on the permittivity of the particle material and also scales as @xmath46 , thus tending to balance @xmath43 .    however , there are ( at least ) two other very efficient attraction mechanisms that can overcome the repulsive force ( [ f_c ] )",
    ". one of them is due to the van der waals interactions between individual molecules of microparticles . for two identical spherical particles ,",
    "hamaker @xcite gives the following expression of the attractive force : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the material - dependent hamaker constant and @xmath49 is the effective distance between surfaces of two particle at the contact @xcite .",
    "( if the polarization of spheres is neglected then @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number density of molecules and @xmath52 is the corresponding london - van der waals constant . ) by comparing eqs ( [ f_c ] ) and ( [ f_vdw ] ) we see that the van der waals attraction is stronger than the coulomb repulsion when @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider an aggregate composed of two sio@xmath6 particles ( @xmath54  j ) of the diameter @xmath7 m ( the smallest particles used in the experiments , see the first row of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . assuming that the particles carry the charge @xmath55 each and are separation by @xmath56   at the contact",
    ", we obtain that @xmath57 is two orders of magnitude stronger than @xmath43 .",
    "note that for metal particles ( such as au , ag , cu ) @xmath48 is typically in the range @xmath58  j @xcite , and therefore the binding force for them should be even stronger .",
    "one should also point out that the particle coating ( see , e.g. , the fifth row of fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) may affect van der waals attraction , provided the coating thickness is comparable to or exceeds @xmath59 and the @xmath52 constant of the coating material is different from that of the particle material .",
    "the second mechanism of attraction can be associated with the discreteness of the charge distribution over the particle surface ( here , we do not discuss the physics of the electron states at dielectric surfaces ) .",
    "the `` mean distance '' between the electrons at the surface , which can be estimated as @xmath61 , is typically of a few dozens of nm .",
    "therefore , when particles get in contact their interaction should strongly depend on whether there are individual electrons in a close proximity of the contact spot .",
    "for instance , if there is one electron _ at each _ particle surface near the contact spot , this will exert an additional repulsive force which can be as large as @xmath62 . however , if an electron is only attached to _",
    "one _ of the particles , this results in the additional _ attraction _ between them due to the local polarization of the particle material .",
    "simple calculations ( representing each particle as an infinite half - space filled with a material of high complex permittivity ) yield the following attractive force due to the `` charge discreteness '' : @xmath63 by comparing eq .",
    "( [ f_disc ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ f_c ] ) we obtain that the charge discreteness force should overcome the coulomb repulsion when @xmath64 , and this condition does not depend on @xmath45 . for sio@xmath6 particles considered above ( to illustrate the van der waals attraction )",
    ", @xmath65 is an order of magnitude stronger than @xmath43 and hence can also contribute to the binding .",
    "note that @xmath65 is really of short - range and can only be important when particles get very close to each other ( @xmath66 )  otherwise the interaction is described by usual `` mean - field '' formulas .",
    "also , @xmath65 must be strongly dependent on the particle ( surface ) conductivity and presumably be much larger for dielectric particles than for conductive ( or coated ) ones .",
    "one should make a common remark concerning both binding mechanisms discussed above . in our calculations we used rather crude assumption that the charges of individual particles in a plasma and charges of particles bound in a cluster are the same .",
    "this assumption is quite justified as the `` first approach '' , since the estimated binding forces turn out to be much stronger than the coulomb repulsion . however , for a more careful analysis of the problem one should take into account the mutual influence of the neighboring particles on their charges ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the binding force should strongly depend not only on the magnitude of the particle charge , but also on the charge distribution over the particle surface .",
    "this very complex issue undoubtedly requires further careful analysis .    to summarize , by triggering dust - acoustic waves in a cloud of microparticles suspended in the pre - sheath region of a low pressure rf discharge ( which is referred to as the unstable regime ) , we were able to accelerate the particles to velocities which were sufficiently high to overcome their mutual coulomb repulsion .",
    "this resulted in the agglomeration  the formation of clusters consisting of two , three , or more particles  yet this effect was observed for particles of different sizes and materials . by tracking individual particles and resolving their scattering collisions with a high - speed camera , we calculated the mean particle charge and reconstructed the relative velocity distribution function .",
    "this allowed us to estimate the coagulation rate during the unstable regime and compare it with the experimental observations .",
    "additionally , by using a long - distance microscope we were able to observe the aggregates _ in situ _",
    ", levitated in a plasma after the wave excitation .",
    "the results presented in this paper unambiguously demonstrate that microparticles , even exposed in a plasma environment , can form stable clusters due to strong short - range binding forces .",
    "we believe that these results can be of great importance to various fields ranging from plasma processing ( where this effect can be utilized , e.g. , to remove dust contamination ) to astrophysics ( where the effect can have a strong impact on the coagulation of cosmic dust ) .",
