    "this leads to the exponential decay of the spin - spin correlation function with a short correlation length .",
    "since the samples always contain finite chain segments , the effect of the inhomogeneity of the field distribution and the decay of the induced surface magnetization are of eminent interest for experimentalists . from a theoretical point of view a related problem , namely that of the effect of a locally applied boundary field was studied @xcite , but for the spin-1/2 case only .",
    "more generally the question arises , how an external local perturbation will affect the behavior of finite or infinite spin chains .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study the spatial dependence of the site magnetization and the spin - spin correlations in an antiferromagnetic spin - s heisenberg chain when a small magnetic field is applied locally . for this purpose we will determine ,",

    "the hamiltonian of the system is written in the form @xmath44 where the first term is the usual first neighbor heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic interaction and the second term denotes the coupling of the field to a spin . in what follows",
    "we will take @xmath45 and measure the field relative to this coupling .",

    "we will apply it on the central site of the chain .    in a finite field",
    "the ground state does not necessarily belong to the singlet , @xmath46 , spin sector and the spin quantum number of the ground state may change as a function of the chain length .",
    "this may lead to complications in the finite - size scaling procedure .",
    "these difficulties can be eliminated by applying the magnetic field on two neighboring sites with opposite strength , in which case the ground state remains always in the singlet sector .",
    "we have therefore used the following expression for the local zeeman term : @xmath47    since we are interested in the response to weak fields , we tried to remain in the regime where the local magnetization is proportional to the applied field .",
    "it turned out that for integer spins , linearity holds at least up to @xmath48 . for",
    "half - odd - integer spins this regime was found to be much smaller , thus @xmath49 fields were used for the @xmath50 chains .",
    "our calculations were performed using the infinite - lattice method of dmrg .",
    "first a chain with @xmath51 sites is built up without field . in the case of open boundary condition",
    "we have used both the spin - reversal and the left - right reflection symmetries in order to reduce the size of the hilbert - space of the superblock configuration .",
    "the field was introduced in the last step of the infinite - lattice method on the two sites between the left and right blocks .",
    "the number of block states kept in the calculation varied between 100 and 200 .",

    "in this section we present the results of our numerical calculations .",
    "chains up to @xmath55 sites were considered .",
    "this allows us to separate the boundary effects and the local magnetization induced by the field .",
    "[ fig : s1obc ] shows the absolute value of the site magnetization calculated with open boundary condition in the ground state which is a total spin singlet ( @xmath46 ) state , for two values of the field applied on the central sites .",
    "the striking result of this calculation is the appearance of the end spins even in the @xmath53 sector for arbitrarily small finite field .",
    "it is also clearly seen in the figure that in the region around the perturbed sites , where the magnetization decays , the amplitude is proportional to the strength of the local field , while close to the free boundary the magnetization is independent of the field . as a comparison fig .",
    "[ fig : s1obc ] also shows the site magnetization calculated for the lowest lying state in the @xmath13 spin sector in the absence of field .",

    "logarithmic plot used in the figure it is clear that near the edge the slopes of the curves obtained for different field values are the same .",
    "when @xmath58 states are kept in the dmrg we have found @xmath59 , reasonably close to the known best result for the decay length .",

    ". the same value is obtained as above .",
    "these short decay lengths ensure that the effects of the edge spins and of the locally applied field could clearly be separated .    to further clarify the origin of the nonvanishing magnetization at the boundary , real @xmath4 spins were attached to the ends of the chain with adjustable @xmath61 couplings .",
    "[ fig : s1b12 ] shows the site dependence of the magnetization on a semi logarithmic plot calculated for @xmath62 .",
    "it is compared to the situation when no extra spins are attached .",
    "i.e. , @xmath63 .    from these results it is found that the effect of the edge spin can be eliminated by the extra spin , while the magnetization is not modified far from the edge .",
    "the fit of the curves obtained with @xmath64 states kept leads to @xmath65 , a result closer to the expected value , than that obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "the accuracy can be improved by fitting the quantities @xmath66 calculated for various values of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath68 . in the @xmath69",
    "limit the value @xmath70 is found .    to complete the analysis ,",
    "let us consider the effect of the field on the spin - spin correlation function . in the absence of magnetic field",
    "the two - point correlation function is usually calculated in the dmrg method by taking the two sites symmetrically with respect to the center of the chain . on the other hand , in the presence of the magnetic field acting on the site @xmath71 , the correlation function @xmath72 was calculated for @xmath71 . employing again eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetal ] ) but with @xmath73 , and fitting the correlation functions obtained for various values of @xmath67 and at different field values in the @xmath74 interval , the value @xmath75 is obtained for the correlation length .    within the numerical accuracy the numbers obtained for the decay length , agree with those obtained by white and huse @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the decay length and the correlation length of the two - point correlation functions are identical and field independent . for weak fields , where linear response is valid ,",
    "there is only one length scale in the system determined by the gap .    in order to have a further check ,",
    "similar calculations were done also with periodic boundary condition .",
    "our results for @xmath76 block states are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1pbc ] . for small @xmath67 values",
    "the magnetization curves are not symmetric and a minimum is observed in the curves .",
    "this is in fact due to the truncation procedure in the dmrg wave function . as the number of the block states",
    "is increased the minimum disappears and the decay of the magnetization becomes more symmetric . carrying out again the @xmath77 extrapolation as a function of @xmath68 , the value of the correlation length scales to @xmath78 in the @xmath69 limit .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the asymmetry mentioned above is related to a similar asymmetry in the local energy @xmath79 inside the blocks used in the dmrg method , if a relatively small number of block states is kept .",
    "this asymmetry provides therefore a better information about the real error than the truncation error @xcite defined in the standard way .",
    "the analysis of the critical half - odd - integer spin system is more complicated due to the logarithmic corrections .",
    "our calculation performed on chains with some @xmath80 sites in the interval @xmath81 , where the magnetization is a linear function of the field .",
    "first we show our results for the decay of the magnetization .",
    "the absolute value of the site magnetization calculated in the @xmath53 spin sector with @xmath64 block states and open boundary condition for @xmath82 and @xmath83 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s12obc ] .",
    "both curves were obtained for the case when the field was applied on two central sites in the configuration @xmath84 . in order to avoid complications coming from the @xmath85 term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logcor ] ) , only the results on even sites are shown .    using a fit to the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ordaff ] ) by measuring the distance @xmath14 from the center of the chain we have found @xmath86 and @xmath87 . since in this case the magnetization shows a downward curvature near the free end , we assumed there the form ( [ eq : xs ] ) .",
    "we have got a good fit with @xmath88 .",
    "basically the same results were obtained when a single site was perturbed and also for other , larger values of the field .",
    "thus we find that like in the ising model , the relationship @xmath89 holds for the heisenberg model .    the effect of the field on the spin - spin correlation function has also been investigated .",
    "following the proposal of ref .  [ 10 ] we have considered the average value @xmath90 \\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ] to remove the @xmath91 correction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : logcor ] ) , where @xmath92 .",

    "[ fig : s12cor ] . eq .",
    "( [ eq : logcor ] ) gives a good fit both without and with field , confirming that apart from logarithmic corrections the leading term in the correlation function goes as @xmath95 even in the non - linear regime .",
    "this result also provides us with a test of the accuracy of our result when compared to those in ref .",
    "[ 10 ] .    as a further check",
    "we have considered the same problem with periodic boundary condition .",
    "the deviation of the local energy from the value obtained at the @xmath71 site was of the order of @xmath96 in the interior of the block from which the system is built up in dmrg , implying that for better accuracy more block states should be used . in spite of this error we have found @xmath97 for the decay of the magnetization and @xmath98 in the spin - spin correlation function in agreement with the result obtained recently by affleck @xcite .",
    "it follows from our previous discussion that open boundary condition usually gives better results , in this case , however , we have to face again the problem of edge spins .",
    "the result of the dmrg calculation performed with open boundary condition and @xmath83 for various values of the block states is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : s32obc ] .",
    "two things are apparent : the contribution of the end spins causes a nonvanishing value of the site magnetization close to the chain ends and an even - odd oscillation is present even if the absolute value of the site magnetization is shown . since the system is critical , the magnetization falls off algebraically .",
    "therefore the effect of the field and of the end spins can not be separated for chains for which the calculation could be done . in order to remove the contribution of the end",
    "spins we have attached real @xmath4 spins to the chain ends .",
    "the site magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s32b12 ] .",
    "the fit to these data gives for the decay exponent @xmath99 , the same value as obtained for the @xmath4 case . since according to the result of ref .",
    "[ 16 ] the exponent of the decay of the spin - spin correlation function is @xmath2 , the relation @xmath23 holds for @xmath41 , too .",
    "the calculation of the profile for free end spins would need at least a few thousand block states as in ref .  [ 16 ] .",
    "in the present paper we have considered spin - s antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chains in a locally applied oppositely oriented magnetic field on two sites in the center of the chain , leaving the boundary spins free .    for the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain it has been found that the linear response of the system holds only for extremely small perturbations .",
    "the exponent describing the decay of the site magnetization was found to be @xmath100 around the locally applied field , while @xmath25 is found for the spin - spin correlation function independently of the field thus confirming numerically , at least in the isotropic point , the analytical result obtained recently by affleck@xcite . near the boundary the decay of the site magnetization changes character and disappears at the edge . assuming the profile predicted by conformal invariance , @xmath101 with @xmath102 , very much like in the ising model .    for the integer spin case it was shown that linear response theory is satisfied for stronger perturbations , too .",
    "the field applied in the center of the chain , however weak it is , will orient the end spins and the site magnetization calculated in the @xmath53 ground state shows a dramatic increase near the ends .",
    "we have confirmed that there exists a single length scale in the system , related to the finite gap . the various bulk and surface quantities fall off exponentially with the same correlation length .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the correlation length in the two - point correlation function is identical to the decay length of the magnetization and that they are field independent .",
    "using periodic boundary condition we have pointed out that a better measure of the accuracy of the dmrg procedure than the truncation error could be obtained from looking at the deviation of the local energy from its mean value .    finally the relationship @xmath103 has been shown to hold for the spin-3/2 heisenberg chain , as well .",
    "although this model has the same bulk critical exponents as the @xmath4 heisenberg model , the magnetization profile is very different , resembling much more that of the @xmath1 model , indicating that indeed effective @xmath4 spins appear at the edges .",
    "unfortunately , our limited computational resources did not allow us to determine the precise form of the profile .",
    "this research was partially supported by the hungarian research fund ( otka ) grant no .",
    "we acknowledge i. peschel , d. j. scalapino and t. ziman for useful discussions , the u.s .- hungarian joint fund and the french ministry of research and technology for supporting our stays in santa barbara and at the institut laue langevin ( grenoble ) , respectively ."
