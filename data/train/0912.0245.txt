    "scaling laws and critical phenomena are intertwined concepts through renormalization - group ( rg ) arguments as scaling ideas describe how physical quantities change under rg transformations .",
    "scaling of physical quantities is particularly interesting because they reveal _ universal _ behaviour within certain global constraints .",
    "the power of universal scaling functions is that they associate seemingly different physical phenomena which shown similar behaviour when properly scaled with the aid of some parameters .",
    "specifically , zero - bias conductance through a single channel quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to a reservoir of conduction electrons as a function of temperature can be accurately fitted with an empirical formula extracted from the numerical renormalization - group calculations , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that at low temperatures and in the kondo regime there is only one relevant energy scale , the kondo temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "experimental realizations of qd devices have reported a successful match between the obtained zero - bias conductance , appropriately scaled by @xmath3 , and the empirical formula @xmath2 @xcite .    when a finite bias voltage @xmath1 is applied between the leads",
    "coupled to the qd , the system is no longer in equilibrium and a new energy scale emerges , @xmath4 ( electron charge times voltage ) .",
    "it is , then , important to restore the corresponding universal scaling behavior . from theoretical considerations on the single qd",
    ", it is expected that conductance as a function of temperature and bias voltage , @xmath5 , may be described by a scaling relation .",
    "this scaling function has a quadratic temperature and voltage dependence , @xcite , in the low range of @xmath0 and @xmath4 compared to @xmath3 .    in a series of experiments in a spin-@xmath6 kondo dot , gaas , grobis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the low temperature and low bias transport properties obtaining a quadratic power law in agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "in addition to this , they suggested a universal function to describe the non - equilibrium conductance with the aid of only two scaling parameters even in the range of large temperatures as compared to the kondo one .",

    "@xcite studied the proposed universal law within the kondo and the mixed valence regimes .",
    "the authors found appropriate scaling relation in both regimes when using the suggested scaling law .",
    "in addition , in the case of the mixed valence regime the parameters involved in the scaling formula match with the experimentally obtained for gaas .",

    "otherwise , in the case of a proportional coupling , @xmath32 , the current through the dot may be obtained solely in terms of the qd spectral function @xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34 represents the asymmetry factor of the couplings between both leads and the dot .",
