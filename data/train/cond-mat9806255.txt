    "the interplay between disorder and many - body interactions in electronic systems has been studied intensively over the last two decades @xcite and still continues to receive much attention .",
    "unlike the case of non - interacting electrons , where the `` scaling hypothesis of localisation '' @xcite can reliably predict the results of many experimental and numerical studies , there is no equally successful approach to localisation when many - particle interactions become important @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental studies of persistent currents in mesoscopic rings and the discovery of a metal - insulator transition in certain two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gases at zero magnetic field @xcite have shown that the presence of interactions can indeed give rise to both quantitatively and qualitatively unexpected phenomena .",
    "a simple and tractable approach to the problem of interacting electrons in disordered materials is the case of only two interacting particles ( tip ) in a random potential in one dimension . for a hubbard on - site",
    "interaction this problem has recently attracted a lot of attention after shepelyansky @xcite argued that attractive as well as repulsive interactions between the two particles ( bosons or fermions ) lead to the formation of particle pairs whose localisation length @xmath9 is much larger than the single - particle ( sp ) localisation length @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "based on a mapping of the tip hamiltonian onto an effective random matrix model ( rmm ) he predicted @xmath11 at two - particle energy @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the nearest - neighbor hopping matrix element and @xmath1 the hubbard interaction strength . shortly afterwards , imry @xcite used a thouless - type block - scaling picture ( bsp ) in support of this .",
    "the major prediction of this work is that in the limit of weak disorder a particle pair will travel much further than a sp .",
    "this should be contrasted with renormalization group studies of the 1d hubbard model at finite particle density which indicate that a repulsive onsite interaction leads to a strongly localised ground state @xcite .",
    "the preferred numerical method for accurately computing localisation lengths in disordered quantum systems is the transfer matrix method ( tmm ) @xcite .",
    "thus it was natural that the first numerical studies devoted to the tip problem also used the tmm to investigate the proposed enhancement of the pair localisation length @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "other direct numerical approaches to the tip problem have been based on the time evolution of wave packets @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , or green function approaches @xcite . in these investigations usually",
    "an enhancement of @xmath9 compared to @xmath10 has been found but the quantitative results tend to differ both from the analytical prediction in eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) , and from each other .",
    "furthermore , a check of the functional dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath10 is numerically very expensive since it requires very large system sizes .    following the approach of ref .",
    ", two of us studied the tip problem by a different tmm @xcite at large system size @xmath14 and found that ( i ) the enhancement @xmath15 decreases with increasing @xmath14 , ( ii ) the behavior of @xmath9 for @xmath4 is equal to @xmath10 in the limit @xmath16 only , and ( iii ) for @xmath17 the enhancement @xmath15 also vanishes completely in this limit .",
    "therefore we concluded @xcite that the tmm applied to the tip problem in 1d measures an enhancement of the localisation length which is due to the finiteness of the systems considered .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that the enhanced localisation length @xmath9 is expected to appear along the diagonal sites of the tip hamiltonian , whereas the tmms of refs .",
    "@xcite proceed along a sp coordinate .",
    "various new tmm approaches have been developed to take this into account @xcite , but still all tmms share a common problem : in general the @xmath4 result for @xmath9 does not equal the value of @xmath18 which is expected for non - interacting particles as explained below .",
    "rather , they show localisation lengths @xmath19 which are much larger than @xmath18 and very close to @xmath20",
    ".    the obvious failure of the tmm approach to the tip problem in a random potential has lead us to search for and apply another well - tested method of computing localisation lengths for disordered system : the decimation method ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , instead of simply considering localization lengths @xmath21 obtained for finite systems @xcite , or by simple extrapolations to large @xmath14 @xcite , we will construct finite - size scaling ( fss ) curves and compute from these curves scaling parameters which are the infinite - sample - size estimates of the localization lengths @xmath22 .",
    "we find that onsite interaction indeed leads to a tip localisation length which is _ larger _ than the sp localisation length at @xmath12 and for not too large @xmath1 .",
    "however , the actual functional dependence is not simply given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) .",
    "in fact our data allow us to see @xmath23 with an exponent @xmath24 which increases with increasing @xmath25 at @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec - dm ] we introduce the numerical dm used to compute the localisation lengths . in section [ sec - test ] , we investigate the numerical reliability of the dm by studying the anderson model in 2d .",
    "we then apply the method to the case of tip in section [ sec - tipdm ] and use fss in order to construct infinite - sample - size estimates in section [ sec - tipdm - fss ] .",
    "we fit our data with various functional forms for @xmath26 put forward in the literature . in section [ sec - iehdm ]",
    "we also study the problem of two interacting particles in different random potentials . in section [ sec - ab2ddm ] , we study the related problem of a sp in a 2d random potential with additional barriers .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec - concl ] .",
    "we shall be considering properties of hamiltonians of the form @xmath27 where the choice of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the definition of @xmath30 depends on the specific problem considered .",
    "for the case of tip in 1d the indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to the positions of each particle on a 1d chain of length @xmath14 and @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "we shall also present results for the case of @xmath34 which corresponds to two interacting particles in different 1d random potentials , e.g. , two electrons on neighboring chains , or an electron and a hole on the same chain . in these cases @xmath35 is the interaction between the two particles . instead of considering tip we can also choose @xmath36 uncorrelated random numbers @xmath37 $ ] and replace @xmath38 in ( [ eq - ham ] ) by @xmath39 .",
    "then the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham ] ) corresponds to the standard anderson model for a single particle in 2d with an additional potential @xmath30 along the diagonal of the 2d square . in all cases we use hard - wall boundary conditions and @xmath40 sets the energy scale .",
    "we now proceed to construct an effective hamiltonian along the diagonal of the @xmath41 lattice by using the dm @xcite . if we write @xmath42 , the defining equation @xmath43 for the green function @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the total number of sites in the system and the indices @xmath47 represent multi - indices for the @xmath36 states @xmath48 . from this",
    "we can see by choosing @xmath49 that @xmath50 substituting into ( [ eq - dec ] ) gives for all @xmath51 @xmath52g_{jk}(e )   = \\delta_{ik}.\\ ] ] in this way we have obtained an effective hamiltonian @xmath53 with matrix elements @xmath54 whose green function is identical to that of the full hamiltonian on all non - decimated sites .",
    "this process is repeated until we are left with an effective hamiltonian for the doubly - occupied sites only .",
    "we remark that due to cpu - time considerations it turned out to be useful to split the hamiltonian into two halves along the diagonal and to start the decimation process from the outer corner of the triangular half and then decimate in slices towards the diagonal .",
    "the procedure is shown pictorially in fig .",
    "[ fig - dm ] .",
    "furthermore , for the case of tip we only need to decimate one half and can use the symmetry of the spatial part of the wave function for the other half .",
    "we shall now focus our attention upon the tip localisation length @xmath9 obtained from the decay of the transmission probability of tip from one end of the system to the other . in accordance with the sp case @xcite ,",
    "@xmath9 is defined by the tip green function , @xmath55 .",
    "more precisely @xcite @xmath56 the green function matrix elements @xmath57 are computed by inverting the matrix @xmath58 obtained from the effective hamiltonian @xmath59 for the doubly occupied sites .",
    "we remark that in order to reduce possible boundary effects , we compute @xmath9 by considering the decay between sites slightly inside the sample instead of the boundary sites @xmath60 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of the surprises of the tip problem is the apparent inapplicability of the tmm approach , which leads to large enhancement of the localisation lengths even in the absence of interaction ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus it appears necessary that before using the dm for the case of tip , we should also check that by restricting ourselves to the decay of the green function along the diagonal , we do not encounter similar artificial enhancements of @xmath19 . as a first test",
    ", we have therefore studied the decay of the green function along the diagonal for the usual 2d anderson model at various disorders @xmath61 and system sizes @xmath62 . for comparison ,",
    "estimates of @xmath10 were computed by the standard tmm @xcite in 2d .",
    "we then use fss as in @xcite and compute the localisation lengths @xmath63 valid at infinite system size for both sets of data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - a2ddm - xi ] we show the resulting localisation lengths @xmath64 obtained by tmm with @xmath65 accuracy and dm averaged over 100 samples for each @xmath66 and @xmath14 .",
    "when we are considering a 2d system , to obtain the correct value of the localisation length we have to multiply the localisation length obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) by @xmath67 to take account of the fact that we are studying the decay along the diagonal . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - a2ddm - xi ] , the agreement is good down to @xmath68 where the fss becomes unreliable .",
    "we clearly see that using the dm to calculate the green function along the diagonal reproduces the well - known results of ref .",
    "up to a geometrical factor which is easily understood .",
    "furthermore , the deviations from the tmm results for @xmath64 show that our method underestimates the infinite system size results . therefore the above mentioned problem of the tmm giving rise to too large a value for the tip - localisation lengths @xmath9 due to small system size should not appear .",
    "we emphasize that the fss procedure is more than an extrapolation to the infinite system size @xcite and it allows us to identify the disorders at which fss breaks down as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - a2ddm - xi ] .    before proceeding to the case of tip",
    ", we need to discuss an important difference between the data obtained from tmm and dm .",
    "the tmm proceeds by multiplying transfer matrices for 2d strips ( 3d bars ) of finite size @xmath14 ( @xmath41 ) many times until convergence is achieved .",
    "the localisation lengths are then computed as eigenvalues of the resulting product matrix @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case of dm ( or any other green function method applied to tip ) , the localisation lengths are estimated by assuming an exponential decay as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) .",
    "such a simple functional form , however , will no longer be reliably observable when @xmath69 and we will start to measure the oscillations in the green function underlying the exponential envelope ( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) . looking at fig .",
    "[ fig - a2ddm - xi ] , we indeed see that the deviations from the tmm result start at @xmath70 , that is , just at the largest system sizes used . increasing",
    "the number of samples will reduce this effect , but this quickly becomes prohibitive due to the immense computational effort . with this in mind , we now continue to the case of tip .",
    "we now compute the green function at @xmath12 for 26 disorder values @xmath66 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_w ] , for 24 system sizes @xmath14 between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and 11 interactions strengths @xmath75 . for each such triplet of parameters",
    "@xmath76 we average the inverse localisation lengths @xmath77 computed from the green function according to eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) over 1000 samples .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_w ] , we show the results for @xmath78 .",
    "let us first turn our attention to the case @xmath4 .",
    "as pointed out previously @xcite , the tip green function @xmath79 at @xmath12 is given by a convolution of two sp green functions @xmath80 at energies @xmath81 and @xmath82 as @xmath83 assuming that @xmath84 $ ] , where @xmath85 is the sp localisation length of states in the 1d anderson model @xcite , one expects that the largest localisation lengths dominate the integral .",
    "since @xmath86 , this implies that @xmath87 $ ] . applying eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) , we get @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "therefore we have also included data for @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_w ] . since @xmath10 deviates from the simple power - law prediction @xcite @xmath89 at @xmath12 for @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , we have computed @xmath10 by tmm @xcite in 1d with @xmath92 accuracy .",
    "comparing these results with the tip localisation lengths obtained from the dm , we find that for @xmath93 , the agreement between @xmath19 and @xmath18 is rather good and , contrary to the tmm results , there is no large artificial enhancement at @xmath4 . for smaller disorders",
    "@xmath94 , we have @xmath95 so that it is not surprising that the green function becomes altered due to the finiteness of the chains @xcite .",
    "this results in reduced values of @xmath9 . for large disorders",
    "@xmath96 , we see a slight upward shift of the computed @xmath9 values compared to @xmath18 .",
    "this effect is due to a numerical problem , since straightforward application of eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) is numerically unreliable for values of @xmath10 as small as 1 .",
    "it is noticeable from these results , however , that the values of @xmath19 are still slightly larger than @xmath18 . in order to explain this behavior ,",
    "we have computed @xmath97 by exact diagonalization of the sp hamiltonian for at least 100 samples at many different energies inside the band and then integrated as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - g1g1 ] ) . plotting the resulting localisation lengths in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_w ] we see that indeed the agreement with @xmath19 is better than with @xmath18 .",
    "thus the corresponding conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite is shown to be true .",
    "for @xmath1 between @xmath98 and @xmath99 we have found that the localisation lengths are increased by the onsite interaction ( cp .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_w ] ) .",
    "we have also seen that for @xmath100 the localisation lengths @xmath21 increase with increasing @xmath1 . for smaller @xmath66 we have @xmath101 and , as discussed above ,",
    "the data become unreliable for fixed system size .    up to now",
    "we have been mostly concerned with the behavior of @xmath9 as function of disorder for @xmath102 $ ] . however , for large @xmath1 , it is well - known that the interaction splits the single tip band into upper and lower hubbard bands",
    ". thus we expect that for large @xmath1 the enhancement of the tip localisation length vanishes . in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_u ] we present data for @xmath103 obtained for three different disorders for system sizes @xmath104 at @xmath12 . in agreement with the previous arguments and calculations @xcite",
    ", we find that the enhancement is symmetric in @xmath1 and decreases for large @xmath25 . for small @xmath25",
    ", we see that the localisation length increases nearly linearly in @xmath25 with a slope that is larger for smaller @xmath66 .",
    "we do not find any @xmath105 behavior as in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite is has been argued that at least for @xmath106 , there exists a critical @xmath107 , which is independent of @xmath66 , at which the enhancement is maximal .",
    "we find that in the present case with @xmath108 the maximum enhancement @xmath109 $ ] depends on the specific value of disorder used .",
    "another observation of ref .",
    "@xcite is the duality in @xmath1 and @xmath110 for very large @xmath25 ( small @xmath111 ) .",
    "the data in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_u ] are only compatible with this duality for the large disorder @xmath112 . for the smaller disorders and for the range of interactions shown , we do not observe the duality .",
    "we emphasize that this may be due to restricting ourselves to values @xmath113 .    for @xmath114 ,",
    "the independence of the enhancement on the sign of the interaction @xmath1 is no longer valid . in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_u_ew ] we show @xmath103 for the same disorders as before , but now at energies @xmath115 .",
    "we find that the enhancement for @xmath116 is larger at @xmath117 than at @xmath118 , whereas exactly the opposite is true for @xmath119 .",
    "thus we see that for positive ( negative ) @xmath1 the energies of tip states are shifted towards higher ( lower ) values , eventually leading to the formation of the aforementioned hubbard bands . in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_u_e ] we show the localisation lengths at several values of @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "as expected from the discussion above the localisation lengths are always smaller than at the band center .",
    "the enhancements , however , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_u_ew ] , can be equally large for @xmath12 and @xmath122 .",
    "in order to overcome the problems with the finite chain lengths , we now proceed to use the fss technique and construct fss curves for each @xmath123 . in fig .  [ fig - tipdm - l2_m ] we show the data for the reduced localisation lengths @xmath124 which is to be rescaled just as in the standard tmm @xcite to obtain the localisation length @xmath26 for the infinite system .",
    "note that data for small @xmath66 is rather noisy and will thus most likely not give very accurate scaling .",

    "we show @xmath9 for @xmath125 and @xmath126 and all interaction strengths @xmath127 .",
    "we see that whereas for @xmath125 the values of @xmath9 for @xmath4 show only small variations for large @xmath14 , the @xmath126 data shows a rapid increase of @xmath9 as @xmath14 increases .",
    "this is due to the numerical problem of estimating a small localisation length of the order of 1 in a large system by eq .",
    "( [ eq - lambda2 ] ) .",
    "it is most pronounced for small @xmath1 where the localisation lengths are the smallest .",
    "going back to fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_m ] , we see that this does not influence the reduced localisation lengths @xmath124 very much and thus is not expected to deteriorate the fss procedure .",
    "however , in order to set an absolute scale in the fss procedure , one usually fits the smallest localisation lengths of the largest systems to @xmath128 with @xmath129 small @xcite . in the present case",
    "this would mean taking the unreliable data for @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , for each @xmath1 we fit to the localisation length at @xmath125 and adjust the absolute scale of @xmath26 accordingly . in fig .",

    "the previously discussed unreliable data for large @xmath66 are visible only in very small upward deviations from the expected @xmath133 behavior . in fig .",

    "[ fig - tipdm - xi2_w ] , e.g. , @xmath137 for @xmath4 and @xmath138 for @xmath116 . thus , although in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipdm - l2_w ] the @xmath9 data at @xmath139 nicely follows @xmath18 for @xmath4 , we nevertheless find that after fss with data from all system sizes , @xmath140 still gives a slight enhancement . because of this in the following we will compare @xmath141 with @xmath140 when trying to identify an enhancement of the localisation lengths due to interaction .",
    "we emphasize that the slight dip in the @xmath142 curve around @xmath143 has also been observed in ref .",

    "[ fig - iehdm - ps ] are also much as before .",
    "thus we can conclude that the case of ieh is very close to the tip problem .",
    "@xcite , two of us argued that straightforward application of the random matrix models ( rmm ) @xcite and the block - scaling picture ( bsp ) @xcite gives rise to an erroneous enhancement of the sp localisation length @xmath64 in a 2d anderson model with additional random perturbing potential @xmath189 $ ] along the diagonal .",
    "in fact , the same is true if the potential along the diagonal is taken to be constant , i.e. @xmath190 . although it appears obvious that no such sp enhancement should exist , we have checked it here with the dm . in fig .",
    "[ fig - a2ddm - xi_u ] we show examples of the resulting sp localisation lengths @xmath64 obtained as before from fss of sp localisation lengths @xmath10 calculated for various system sizes @xmath191 , disorders @xmath66 and potentials @xmath123 .",
    "as expected , we find that for large disorders @xmath192 , the data is well described by the 2d tmm results already presented in section [ sec - test ] .",
    "there are only small changes due to the additional random potential , all of which tend to decrease the localisation lengths as they should .",
    "this is in contrast to the straightforward application of the rmm and the bsp @xcite which therefore fail for the 2d sp anderson model with additional random potential along the diagonal .",
    "of course this does not mean that these methods also have to fail for tip , where , as we have shown in the previous sections , a tendency towards delocalisation due to interaction definitely exists .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented detailed results for the localization lengths of pair states of two interacting particles in 1d random potentials . by using the dm to calculate the green function along the diagonal it is possible to consider the 2d anderson model and the problem of two interacting particles in 1d within the same numerical formalism .",
    "we have checked that for the 2d anderson model without interaction the infinite system size results obtained via fss from the dm data are in good agreement with results obtained from the standard tmm especially for localisation lengths up to the largest system sizes we have considered .",
    "it is also apparent that the dm data deviate from the tmm only towards smaller localisation lengths and hence no artificial enhancement of localisation lengths due to the dm approach is expected .    for tip in 1d",
    "we observe an enhancement of the two - particle localisation length up to @xmath193 due to onsite interaction .",
    "this enhancement persists , unlike for tmm , in the limit of large system size and after constructing infinite - sample - size estimates from the fss curves .",
    "we have tried to fit our results to various suggested models .",
    "the best fit was obtained with eq .",
    "( [ eq - ps ] ) in which the enhancement @xmath194 depends on an exponent @xmath24 which is a function of the interaction strength @xmath1 .",
    "such a @xmath1-dependent exponent had been previously predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite for interaction strengths up to @xmath116 with @xmath24 up to 2 . however , we find that @xmath24 reaches at most @xmath165 for @xmath116 .",
    "thus we do not see a behavior as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) with exponent @xmath146 when using the fit function of ref .  @xcite . on the other hand , after scaling the data onto a single scaling curve and using the fit function ( [ eq - oppen ] ) as proposed with @xmath161 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find indeed @xmath161 for not too small disorder strength , e.g. , @xmath195 for @xmath116 , but observe a crossover to a behavior with @xmath162 for smaller @xmath66 . for values of @xmath196",
    "we observe that the enhancement decreases again ; the position of the maximum depends upon @xmath66 .",
    "very similar results are produced by placing the two particles in different potentials which is of relevance for a proposed experimental test of the tip effect @xcite .    as a final check on our results we consider the effect of an additional on - site potential ( both random and uniform ) on the results for the sp 2d anderson model .",
    "as one may expect for the case of an additional random potential one observes only a small decrease in the localisation length while for an additional uniform potential there is a small change in @xmath64 towards decreasing localization lengths for positive @xmath1 .",
