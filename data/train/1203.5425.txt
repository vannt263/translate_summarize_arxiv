    "this article reports work carried out under the auspices of the committee on data for science and technology ( codata ) task group on fundamental constants .",
    "it describes in detail the codata 2010 least - squares adjustment of the values of the constants , for which the closing date for new data was 31 december 2010 .",
    "equally important , it gives the 2010 self - consistent set of over 300 codata recommended values of the fundamental physical constants based on the 2010 adjustment .",
    "the 2010 set , which replaces its immediate predecessor resulting from the codata 2006 adjustment @xcite , first became available on 2 june 2011 at physics.nist.gov/constants , a web site of the nist fundamental constants data center ( fcdc ) .",
    "the world wide web has engendered a sea change in expectations regarding the availability of timely information .",
    "further , in recent years new data that influence our knowledge of the values of the constants seem to appear almost continuously . as a consequence ,",
    "the task group decided at the time of the 1998 codata adjustment to take advantage of the extensive computerization that had been incorporated in that effort to issue a new set of recommended values every 4 years ; in the era of the web , the 12 - 13 years between the first codata set of 1973 @xcite and the second codata set of 1986 @xcite , and between this second set and the third set of 1998 @xcite , could no longer be tolerated .",
    "thus , if the 1998 set is counted as the first of the new 4-year cycle , the 2010 set is the 4th of that cycle .    throughout this article",
    "we refer to the detailed reports describing the 1998 , 2002 , and 2006 adjustments as codata-98 , codata-02 , and codata-06 , respectively @xcite . to keep the paper to a reasonable length",
    ", our data review focuses on the new results that became available between the 31 december 2006 and 31 december 2010 closing dates of the 2006 and 2010 adjustments ; the reader should consult these past reports for detailed discussions of the older data .",
    "these past reports should also be consulted for discussions of motivation , philosophy , the treatment of numerical calculations and uncertainties , etc . a rather complete list of acronyms and symbols may be found in the nomenclature section near the end of the paper .    to further achieve a reduction in the length of this report compared to the lengths of its three most recent predecessors",
    ", it has been decided to omit extensive descriptions of new experiments and calculations and to comment only on their most pertinent features ; the original references should be consulted for details . for the same reason , sometimes the older data used in the 2010 adjustment are not given in the portion of the paper that discusses the data by category , but are given in the portion of the paper devoted to data analysis .",
    "for example , the actual values of the 16 older items of input data recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : elmeas ] are given only in sec .",
    "[ sec : ad ] , rather than in both sections as done in previous adjustment reports .",
    "as in all previous codata adjustments , as a working principle , the validity of the physical theory underlying the 2010 adjustment is assumed .",
    "this includes special relativity , quantum mechanics , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the standard model of particle physics , including @xmath0 invariance , and the exactness ( for all practical purposes  see sec .",
    "[ sec : elmeas ] ) of the relationships between the josephson and von klitzing constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the elementary charge @xmath3 and planck constant @xmath4 , namely , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "although the possible time variation of the constants continues to be an active field of both experimental and theoretical research , there is no observed variation relevant to the data on which the 2010 recommended values are based ; see , for example , the recent reviews by @xcite and @xcite . other references may be found in the fcdc bibliographic database at physics.nist.gov/constantsbib using , for example , the keywords `` time variation '' or `` constants . ''    with regard to the 31 december closing date for new data , a datum was considered to have met this date if the task group received a preprint describing the work by that date and the preprint had already been , or shortly would be , submitted for publication .",
    "although results are identified by the year in which they were published in an archival journal , it can be safely assumed that any input datum labeled with an `` 11 '' or `` 12 '' identifier was in fact available by the closing date .",
    "however , the 31 december 2010 closing date does not apply to clarifying information requested from authors ; indeed , such information was received up to shortly before 2 june 2011 , the date the new values were posted on the fcdc web site .",
    "this is the reason that some `` private communications '' have 2011 dates .",
    "the 2010 set of recommended values is the result of applying the same procedures as in previous adjustments and is based on a least - squares adjustment with , in this case , @xmath7 items of input data , @xmath8 variables called _ adjusted constants _ , and @xmath9 degrees of freedom .",
    "the statistic `` chi - squared '' is @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 and birge ratio @xmath12 .",
    "a significant number of new results became available for consideration , both experimental and theoretical , from 1 january 2007 , after the closing date of the 2006 adjustment , to 31 december 2010 , the closing date of the current adjustment .",
    "data that affect the determination of the fine - structure constant @xmath13 , planck constant @xmath4 , molar gas constant @xmath14 , newtonian constant of gravitation @xmath15 , rydberg constant @xmath16 , and rms proton charge radius @xmath17 are the focus of this brief overview , because of their inherent importance and , in the case of @xmath13 , @xmath4 , and @xmath14 , their impact on the determination of the values of many other constants .",
    "( constants that are not among the directly adjusted constants are calculated from appropriate combinations of those that are directly adjusted . )",
    "an improved measurement of the electron magnetic moment anomaly @xmath18 , the discovery and correction of an error in its theoretical expression , and an improved measurement of the quotient @xmath19 have led to a 2010 value of @xmath13 with a relative standard uncertainty of @xmath20 compared to @xmath21 for the 2006 value . of more significance , because of the correction of the error in the theory , the 2010 value of @xmath13 shifted significantly and now is larger than the 2006 value by @xmath22 times the uncertainty of that value .",
    "this change has rather profound consequences , because many constants depend on @xmath13 , for example , the molar planck constant @xmath23 .",
    "a new value of the avogadro constant @xmath24 with a relative uncertainty of @xmath25 obtained from highly enriched silicon with amount of substance fraction @xmath26 replaces the 2006 value based on natural silicon and provides an inferred value of @xmath4 with essentially the same uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty is somewhat smaller than @xmath27 , the uncertainty of the most accurate directly measured watt - balance value of @xmath4 . because the two values disagree ,",
    "the uncertainties used for them in the adjustment were increased by a factor of two to reduce the inconsistency to an acceptable level ; hence the relative uncertainties of the recommended values of @xmath4 and @xmath28 are @xmath29 , only slightly smaller than the uncertainties of the corresponding 2006 values .",
    "the 2010 value of @xmath4 is larger than the 2006 value by the fractional amount @xmath30 while the 2010 value of @xmath24 is smaller than the 2006 value by the fractional amount @xmath31 .",
    "a number of other constants depend on @xmath4 , for example , the first radiation constant @xmath32 , and consequently the 2010 recommended values of these constants reflect the change in @xmath4 .",
    "four consistent new values of the molar gas constant together with the two previous consistent values , with which the new values also agree , have led to a new 2010 recommended value of @xmath14 with an uncertainty of @xmath33 compared to @xmath34 for the 2006 value .",
    "the 2010 value is smaller than the 2006 value by the fractional amount @xmath35 and the relative uncertainty of the 2010 value is a little over half that of the 2006 value .",
    "this shift and uncertainty reduction is reflected in a number of constants that depend on @xmath14 , for example , the boltzmann constant @xmath36 and the stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath37 .",
    "two new values of @xmath15 resulting from two new experiments each with comparatively small uncertainties but in disagreement with each other and with earlier measurements with comparable uncertainties led to an even larger expansion of the a priori assigned uncertainties of the data for @xmath15 than was necessary in 2006 . in both cases",
    "the expansion was necessary to reduce the inconsistencies to an acceptable level .",
    "this increase has resulted in a 20% increase in uncertainty of the 2010 recommended value compared to that of the 2006 value : @xmath38 parts in @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 parts in @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , the 2010 recommended value of @xmath15 is smaller than the 2006 value by the fractional amount @xmath41 .",
    "new experimental and theoretical results that have become available in the past 4 years have led to the reduction in the relative uncertainty of the recommended value of the rydberg constant from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , and the reduction in uncertainty from @xmath44 fm to @xmath45 fm of the proton rms charge radius based on spectroscopic and scattering data but not muonic hydrogen data .",
    "data from muonic hydrogen , with the assumption that the muon and electron interact with the proton at short distances in exactly the same way , are so inconsistent with the other data that they have not been included in the determination of @xmath17 and thus do not have an influence on @xmath16 .",
    "the 2010 value of @xmath16 exceeds the 2006 value by the fractional amount @xmath46 and the 2010 value of @xmath17 exceeds the 2006 value by @xmath47 fm .",
    "section  [ sec : squ ] briefly recalls some constants that have exact values in the international system of units ( si ) @xcite , the unit system used in all codata adjustments .",
    "sections  [ sec : ram]-[sec : xeq ] discuss the input data with a strong focus on those results that became available between the 31 december 2006 and 31 december 2010 closing dates of the 2006 and 2010 adjustments .",
    "it should be recalled ( see especially appendix e of codata-98 ) that in a least - squares analysis of the constants , both the experimental and theoretical numerical data , also called observational data or input data , are expressed as functions of a set of independent variables called directly adjusted constants ( or sometimes simply adjusted constants ) .",
    "the functions themselves are called observational equations , and the least - squares procedure provides best estimates , in the least - squares sense , of the adjusted constants . in essence , the procedure determines the best estimate of a particular adjusted constant by automatically taking into account all possible ways of determining its value from the input data . as",
    "already noted , the recommended values of those constants not directly adjusted are calculated from the adjusted constants .",
    "section  [ sec : ad ] describes the analysis of the data .",
    "the analysis includes comparison of measured values of the same quantity , measured values of different quantities through inferred values of another quantity such as @xmath13 or @xmath4 , and by the method of least - squares .",
    "the final input data used to determine the adjusted constants , and hence the entire 2010 codata set of recommended values , are based on these investigations .",
    "section  [ sec:2010crv ] provides , in several tables , the set of over 300 recommended values of the basic constants and conversion factors of physics and chemistry , including the covariance matrix of a selected group of constants .",
    "section  [ sec : c ] concludes the report with a comparison of a small representative subset of 2010 recommended values with their 2006 counterparts , comments on some of the more important implications of the 2010 adjustment for metrology and physics , and suggestions for future experimental and theoretical work that will improve our knowledge of the values of the constants",
    ". also touched upon is the potential importance of this work and that of the next codata constants adjustment ( expected 31 december 2014 closing date ) for the redefinition of the kilogram , ampere , kelvin , and mole currently under discussion internationally @xcite .",
    "as a consequence of the si definitions of the meter , the ampere , and the mole , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and @xmath51c ) and @xmath52 , have exact values ; see table  [ tab : exact ] . since the relative atomic mass @xmath53 of an entity @xmath54",
    "is defined by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mass of @xmath54 , and the ( unified ) atomic mass constant @xmath57 is defined according to @xmath58 = @xmath59 , @xmath60 exactly , as shown in the table .",
    "since the number of specified entities in one mole is equal to the numerical value of the avogadro constant @xmath61/mol , it follows that the molar mass of an entity @xmath54 , @xmath62 , is given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the ( unified ) atomic mass unit u ( also called the dalton , da ) , is defined as 1 u @xmath65 kg . the last two entries in table  [ tab : exact ] , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are the conventional values of the josephson and von klitzing constants introduced on 1 january 1990 by the international committee for weights and measures ( cipm ) to foster worldwide uniformity in the measurement of electrical quantities . in this paper , those electrical quantities measured in terms of the josephson and quantum hall effects with the assumption that @xmath1 and @xmath2 have these conventional values",
    "are labeled with a subscript 90 .",
    "measurements of the quantity @xmath68 using a moving coil watt balance ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : elmeas ] ) require the determination of the local acceleration of free fall @xmath69 at the site of the balance with a relative uncertainty of a few parts in @xmath70 .",
    "that currently available absolute gravimeters can achieve such an uncertainty if properly used has been demonstrated by comparing different instruments at essentially the same location .",
    "an important example is the periodic international comparison of absolute gravimeters ( icag ) carried out at the international bureau of weights and measures ( bipm ) , svres , france @xcite .",
    "the good agreement obtained between a commercial optical interferometer - based gravimeter that is in wide use and a cold atom , atomic interferometer - based instrument also provides evidence that the claimed uncertainties of determinations of @xmath69 are realistic @xcite .",
    "however , not all gravimeter comparisons have obtained such satisfactory results @xcite .",
    "additional work in this area may be needed when the relative uncertainties of watt - balance experiments reach the level of 1 part in @xmath71 .",

    "thus , a watt balance is operated in two different modes : the weighing mode and the velocity mode .",

    "the npl final result is based on the initial data obtained from october 2006 to march 2007 , data obtained during the first half of 2008 , and data obtained during the first half of 2009 , the final period .",
    "many variables were investigated to determine their possible influence on the measured values of @xmath1293 .",
    "for example , several mass standards with different masses and fabricated from different materials were used during the course of the data taking .",
    "a comparison of the uncertainty budgets for the 2007 data and the 2009 data shows significant reductions in all categories , with the exception of the calibration of the mass standards , resulting in the reduction of the overall uncertainty from 66 parts in @xmath70 to 36 parts in @xmath70 .",
    "nevertheless , during the week before the balance was to be dismantled , a previously unrecognized possible systematic error in the weighing mode of the experiment came to light .",
    "although there was insufficient time to derive a correction for the effect , robinson obtained an uncertainty estimate for it .",
    "this additional uncertainty component , 197 parts in @xmath70 , when combined with the initially estimated overall uncertainty , leads to the 200 parts in @xmath70 final uncertainty in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hwbnpl12 ] ) and ( [ eq : kj2rknpl12 ] ) .",
    "since the same component applies to the initial mark ii result , its uncertainty is increased from 66 parts in @xmath70 to @xmath1324 parts in @xmath70 .",

    "for example , the metas apparatus was designed to use a 100  g mass standard and a commercial mass comparator rather than a 1 kg standard and a specially designed and constructed balance in order to reduce the size and complexity of the apparatus .",
    "also , the velocity mode was designed to be completely independent of the weighing mode .",
    "the use of two separated measuring systems for the two modes in the same apparatus make it possible to optimize each , but does require the transfer of the coil between the two systems during the course of the measurements .",
    "improvements in the apparatus over the last several years of its operation focused on alignment , control of the coil position , and reducing magnet hysteresis .",
    "the metas result is based on six sets of data acquired in 2010 , each containing at least 500 individual measurements which together represent over 3400 hours of operation of the apparatus .",
    "the @xmath1327 relative standard uncertainty of the mean of the means of the six data sets is considered by @xcite to be a measure of the reproducibility of the apparatus .",
    "the uncertainty budget from which the @xmath1328 relative uncertainty of the metas value of @xmath1308 is obtained contains nine components , but the dominant contributions , totaling 20 parts in @xmath71 , are associated with the alignment of the apparatus .",
    "@xcite point out that because of the mechanical design of the current metas watt balance , it is not possible to reduce this source of uncertainty in a significant way .",

    "@xmath1329 and @xmath1330 has been discussed in the three previous codata reports and references cited therein .",
    "the vast majority of the experimental evidence for both effects over the years comes from tests of the universality of these relations ; that is , their invariance with experimental variables such as the material of which the josephson effect and quantum hall effect devices are fabricated .",

    "these authors examined a vast number of josephson junction voltage comparisons conducted over the past 30 years involving many different laboratories , junction materials , types of junctions , operating frequencies , step numbers , number of junctions in series , voltage level , and operating temperature with some comparisons achieving a precision of a few parts in @xmath706 .",
    "they find no evidence that the relation @xmath1333 is not universal .",
    "there are three noteworthy developments for the quantum hall effect .",
    "first is the recent publication of a _ c. r. physique _ special issue on the quantum hall effect and metrology with a number of theoretical as well as experimental papers that support the exactness of the relation @xmath1330 ; see the foreword to this issue by @xcite and the papers contained therein , as well as the recent review article by @xcite .",
    "the second is the agreement found between the value of @xmath2 in a normal gaas / algaas heterostructure quantum hall effect device and a graphene ( two dimensional graphite ) device to within the 8.6 parts in @xmath706 uncertainty of the experiment @xcite .",
    "this is an extremely important result in support of the universality of the above relation , because of the significant difference in the charge carriers in graphene and the usual two dimensional semiconductor systems ; see @xcite .",
    "the third is the theoretical paper by @xcite .",

    "@xmath183 is the magnetic flux density applied to the quantum hall effect device and @xmath1338  t. however , since @xmath183 is generally no larger than 20  t , the correction , approximately @xmath1339 , is vanishingly small and can be completely ignored .",
    "further , @xcite argues that because of the topological nature of the quantum hall effect , there can be no other type of correction including finite size effects .",
    "experimental results obtained using nearly perfect single crystals of natural silicon are discussed here , along with a new result for @xmath28 with a relative standard uncertainty of @xmath1340 obtained using highly - enriched silicon . for this material , @xmath1341 , compared to @xmath1342 , for natural silicon , where @xmath1343 is the amount - of - substance fraction of the indicated isotope .",
    "the new @xmath24 result ( see sec .  [ ssec : naiac ] below ) , as well as much of the natural silicon data used in the current and previous codata adjustments , were obtained as part of an extensive international effort under way since the early 1990s to determine @xmath24 with the smallest possible uncertainty .",
    "this worldwide enterprise , which has many participating laboratories and is called the international avogadro coordination ( iac ) , carries out its work under the auspices of the consultative committee for mass and related quantities ( ccm ) of the cipm .",

    "for simplicity the shortened forms w4.2a , w04 , w17 , nr3 , and nr4 are used in quantity symbols for the first five crystals .",
    "note also that crystal labels actually denote the single crystal ingot from which the crystal samples are taken , since no distinction is made between different samples taken from the same ingot .",

    ", it can be assumed that @xmath222 , and thus @xmath1347 , of an impurity free , crystallographically perfect or `` ideal '' silicon crystal at specified conditions of temperature @xmath1348 , pressure @xmath1349 , and isotopic composition is an invariant of nature .",
    "the currently adopted reference conditions for natural silicon are @xmath135022.5  @xmath1121 and @xmath1351 ( vacuum ) , where @xmath1352 is celsius temperature on the international temperature scale of 1990 ( its-90 ) .",
    "reference values for @xmath1343 have not been adopted , because any variation of @xmath1344 with the typical isotopic composition variation observed for the natural silicon crystals used is deemed negligible . to convert the lattice spacing @xmath1344 of a real crystal to the lattice spacing @xmath1347 of an ideal crystal requires the application of corrections for impurities , mainly carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen .",
    "typical variation in the lattice spacing of different samples from the same ingot is taken into account by including an additional relative standard uncertainty component of @xmath1353 for each crystal in the uncertainty budget of any measurement result involving one or more silicon lattice spacings .",
    "however , the component is @xmath1354 in the case of crystal mo * because it is known to contain a comparatively large amount of carbon . for simplicity",
    ", we do not explicitly mention the inclusion of such components in the following discussion .",

    "capacitive transducers sense crystal displacement , parasitic rotations , and transverse motions , and feedback loops provide positioning with picometer resolution , alignment with nanometer resolution , and movement of the analyzer with nanometer straightness .",
    "a number of fractional corrections for different effects , such as laser wavelength , laser beam diffraction , laser beam alignment , and temperature of the crystal , are applied in each determination ; the total correction for each of the three results , in parts in @xmath70 , is 6.5 , @xmath1364 , and 3.7 , respectively .",
    "the relative standard uncertainties of the three lattice spacing measurements without the additional uncertainty component for possible variation in the lattice spacing of different samples from the same ingot , again in parts in @xmath70 , are 6.1 , 5.2 , and 5.2 .",

    "the isotopic composition of the argon and its impurity content was determined at irmm @xcite .",
    "the five uncertainty components of the final 1.24 parts in @xmath679 uncertainty of the result , with each component itself being composed of a number of subcomponents , are , in parts in @xmath679 , the following : 0.30 from temperature measurements ( the nominal temperature of the quasisphere was @xmath1450 ; 0.57 from the em measurement of the quasisphere s volume ; 0.84 from the determination of @xmath1451 ; 0.60 associated with the argon molar mass and its impurities ; and 0.25 for experimental repeatability based on the results from two series of measurements carried out in may and july of 2009 .    because the lne 2009 and 2011 results are from experiments in which some of the equipment and measuring techniques are the same or similar , they are correlated . indeed ,",

    "the inrim determination of @xmath14 by @xcite employed a stainless steel spherical resonator of about 182  mm inner diameter and non - flowing helium gas . although the measurements were performed with the resonator very near @xmath1448 as in the other agt molar - gas - constant determinations , two important aspects of the inrim experiment are quite different .",
    "first , the speed of sound was measured at only one pressure , namely , 410  kpa , and the extrapolation to @xmath1391 was implemented using the comparatively well - known theoretical values of the required @xmath690 equation - of - state and acoustic virial coefficients .",
    "second , the radius of the resonator was determined using the theoretical value of the @xmath690 index of refraction together with eight measured em resonance frequencies and the corresponding predicted eigenvalues .",

    "[ sssec : calcncg ] .",
    "the inconsistencies between different measurements of @xmath15 as discussed in the reports of previous codata adjustments demonstrate the historic difficulty of determining this most important constant .",
    "unfortunately , this difficulty has been demonstrated anew with the publication of two new competitive results for @xmath15 during the past 4 years .",
    "the first is an improved value from the group at the huazhong university of science and technology ( hust ) , prc , identified as hust-09 @xcite ; the second is a completely new value from researchers at jila , boulder , colorado , usa , identified as jila-10 @xcite .",
    "( jila , formerly known as the joint institute for laboratory astrophysics , is a joint institute of nist and the university of colorado and is located on the university of colorado campus , boulder , colorado . )",
    "the publication of the jila value has led the task group to re - examine and modify two earlier results .",
    "the first is that obtained at nist ( then known as the national bureau of standards ) by @xcite in a nist - university of virginia ( uva ) collaboration , labeled nist-82 .",
    "this value was the basis for the codata 1986 recommended value @xcite and was taken into account in determining the codata 1998 value @xcite , but played no role in either the 2002 or 2006 adjustments .",
    "the second is the los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) , los alamos , usa , result of @xcite , labeled lanl-97 ; it was first included in the 1998 codata adjustment and in all subsequent adjustments .",
    "details of the modifications to nist-82 and lanl-97 ( quite minor for the latter ) , the reasons for including nist-82 in the 2010 adjustment , and discussions of the new values hust-09 and jila-10 are given below .",
    "the 11 available values of @xmath15 , which are data items @xmath1548-@xmath1549 in table  [ tab : bigg ] , sec .",
    "[ sec : ad ] , are the same as in 2006 with the exception of nist-82 , slightly modified lanl-97 , and the two new values .",
    "thus , in keeping with our approach in this report , there is no discussion of the other seven values since they have been covered in one or more of the previous reports .    for simplicity , in the following text , we write @xmath15 as a numerical factor multiplying @xmath1550 , where @xmath1551        as discussed in codata-98 , the experiment of @xcite used a fiber - based torsion balance operated in the dynamic mode and the time - of - swing method , thereby requiring measurement of a small change in the long oscillation period of the balance .",
    "ideally , the torsional spring constant of the fiber should be independent of frequency at very low frequencies , for example , at 3 mhz .    long after the publication of the nist - uva result , @xcite [ see also @xcite and @xcite ] pointed out that the anelasticity of such fibers is sufficiently large to cause the value of @xmath15 determined in this way to be biased . if @xmath1552 is the quality factor of the main torsional mode of the fiber and it is assumed that the damping of the torsion balance is solely due to the losses in the fiber , then the unbiased value of @xmath15 is related to the experimentally observed value @xmath1553 by @xcite @xmath1554    although the exact value of the @xmath1552 of the fiber used in the nist - uva experiment is unknown , one of the researchers @xcite has provided an estimate , based on data obtained during the course of the experiment , of no less than 10000 and no greater than 30000 . assuming a rectangular probability density function for @xmath1552 with these lower and upper limits then leads to @xmath1555 with a relative standard uncertainty of @xmath1556 .",
    "using these values , the result @xmath1557 @xmath1558 $ ] @xcite , @xcite , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : gqgobs ] ) we obtain    @xmath1559 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : bgnbs82}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this case the correction @xmath1560 reduced @xmath1561 by the fractional amount @xmath1562 , but increased its @xmath1563 relative standard uncertainty by a negligible amount .",
    "the task group decided to include the value given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bgnbs82 ] ) as an input datum in the 2010 adjustment even though it was not included in the 2002 and 2006 adjustments , because information provided by @xcite allows the original result to be corrected for the kuroda effect .",
    "further , although there were plans to continue the nist - uva experiment @xcite , recent conversations with @xcite made clear that the measurements on which the result is based were thorough and complete .",
    "the experiment of @xcite , also described in detail in codata-98 , is similar to the nist - uva experiment of @xcite , and in fact used some of the same components including the tungsten source masses .",
    "its purpose was not only to determine @xmath15 , but also to test the kuroda hypothesis by using two different fibers , one with @xmath1564 and the other with @xmath1565 .",
    "because the value of @xmath15 resulting from this experiment is correlated with the nist - uva value and both values are now being included in the adjustment , we evaluated the correlation coefficient of the two results .",
    "this was done with information from @xcite , @xcite , and the ph.d .",
    "thesis of @xcite .",
    "we take into account the uncertainties of the two @xmath1552 values ( 2% ) and the correlation coefficient of the two values of @xmath15 obtained from the two fibers ( 0.147 ) when computing their weighted mean .",
    "the final result is @xmath1566\\ , , \\label{eq : bglanl97}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which in fact is essentially the same as the value used in the 2002 and 2006 adjustments .",
    "the correlation coefficient of the nist - uva and lanl values of @xmath15 is 0.351 .",
    "the improved hust-09 result for @xmath15 was first reported by @xcite and subsequently described in detail by @xcite ; it represents a reduction in uncertainty , compared to the previous huazhong university result hust-05 , of about a factor of five . as pointed out by @xcite , a number of changes in the earlier experiment contributed to this uncertainty reduction , including ( i ) replacement of the two stainless steel cylindrical source masses by spherical source masses with a more homogeneous density ; ( ii ) use of a rectangular quartz block as the principal portion of the torsion balance s pendulum , thereby improving the stability of the period of the balance and reducing the uncertainty of the pendulum s moment of inertia ; ( iii ) a single vacuum chamber for the source masses and pendulum leading to a reduction of the uncertainty of their relative positions ; ( iv ) a remotely operated stepper motor to change the positions of the source masses , thereby reducing environmental changes ; and ( v ) measurement of the anelasticity of the torsion fiber with the aid of a high-@xmath1552 quartz fiber .",
    "the final result is the average of two values of @xmath15 that differ by 9 parts in @xmath679 obtained from two partially correlated determinations using the same apparatus .",
    "the dominant components of uncertainty , in parts in @xmath679 , are 19 from the measurement of the fiber s anelasticity , 14 ( statistical ) from the measurement of the change in the square of the angular frequency of the pendulum when the source masses are in their near and far positions , and 10 from the measured distance between the geometric centers of the source masses .",
    "although the uncertainty of hust-05 is five times larger than that of hust-09 , @xcite and co - workers do not believe that hust-09 supersedes hust-05 .",
    "thus , both are considered for inclusion in the 2010 adjustment .",
    "based on information provided to the task group by the researchers @xcite , their correlation coefficient is estimated to be 0.234 and is used in the calculations of sec .  [",
    "sec : ad ] .",
    "the extra digits for the value and uncertainty of hust-05 were also provided by @xcite .      as can be seen from table  [ tab : bg ] , the @xmath1567 relative standard uncertainty of the value of @xmath15 identified as jila-10 and obtained at jila by @xcite has the third smallest estimated uncertainty of the values listed and is the second smallest of those values .",
    "it differs from the value with the smallest uncertainty , identified as uwash-00 , by @xmath1568 parts in @xmath679 , which is @xmath1569 times the standard uncertainty of their difference @xmath1570 , or `` @xmath1571 . ''",
    "this disagreement is an example of the `` historic difficulty '' referred to at the very beginning of this section .",
    "the data on which the jila researchers based their result was taken in 2004 , but being well aware of this inconsistency they hesitated to publish it until they checked and rechecked their work @xcite . with",
    "this done , they decided it was time to report their value for @xmath15 .",
    "the apparatus used in the jila experiment of @xcite consisted of two @xmath1572 copper test masses ( or `` pendulum bobs '' ) separated by @xmath1573 , each of which was suspended from a supporting bar by four wires and together they formed a fabry - perot cavity .",
    "when the four @xmath1574 cylindrical tungsten source masses , two pairs with each member of the pair on either side of the laser beam traversing the cavity , were periodically moved parallel to the laser beam from their inner and outer positions ( they remained stationary for @xmath1575 in each position ) , the separation between the bobs changed by about @xmath1576 .",
    "this change was observed as a @xmath1577 beat frequency between the laser locked to the pendulum cavity and the laser locked to a reference cavity that was part of the supporting bar .",
    "the geometry of the experiment reduces the most difficult aspect of determining the gravitational field of the source masses to six one dimensional measurements : the distance between opposite source mass pairs in the inner and outer positions and the distances between adjacent source masses in the inner position .",
    "the most important relative standard uncertainty components contributing to the uncertainty of @xmath15 are , in parts in @xmath679 @xcite , the six critical dimension measurements , 14 ; all other dimension measurements and source mass density inhomogeneities , 8 each ; pendulum spring constants , 7 ; and total mass measurement and interferometer misalignment , 6 each .",
    "as already noted , we leave the calculation of the 2010 recommended value of @xmath15 to sec .",
    "[ sssec : calcncg ] .",
    "as in previous adjustments , there are a few cases in the 2010 adjustment where an inexact constant that is used in the analysis of input data is not treated as an adjusted quantity , because the adjustment has a negligible effect on its value .",
    "three such constants , used in the calculation of the theoretical expression for the electron magnetic moment anomaly @xmath771 , are the mass of the tau lepton @xmath1578 , the fermi coupling constant @xmath850 , and sine squared of the weak mixing angle sin@xmath1579 ; they are obtained from the most recent report of the particle data group @xcite : @xmath1580\\ , , \\label{eq : mtaumev }   \\\\[10 pt ] { g_{\\rm f}\\over(\\hbar c)^{3 } } & = &   1.166\\,364(5)\\times 10^{-5 } \\ { \\rm gev}^{-2 } \\quad [ 4.3\\times 10^{-6}]\\ , ,   \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : gf }   \\\\ { \\rm sin}^{2}{\\theta}_{\\rm w } & = &   0.2223(21 ) \\qquad [ 9.5\\times 10^{-3 } ] \\ , .",

    "examination of table  [ tab : epsilons ] shows that although the values of @xmath2660 from adjustments ( iv ) and ( v ) are of opposite sign , their difference of @xmath2665 is less than the @xmath2666 uncertainty of the difference .",
    "however , the difference between the values of @xmath2667 from adjustments ( iv ) and ( vi ) is @xmath2668 , and is @xmath2669 even for the value of @xmath2660 from adjustment ( vii ) , in which the uncertainties of the most accurate data have been increased by the factor 2 .",
    "( the multiplicative factor 2 is that used in adjustment 2 and the final adjustment ; see tables  [ tab : adjres ] , [ tab : adjustsall ] , and their associated text . ) on the other hand , we see that the value of @xmath2660 from adjustment ( vi ) is consistent with 0 only to within 3.9 times its uncertainty , but that this is reduced to 2.0 for the value of @xmath2667 from adjustment ( vii ) which uses expanded uncertainties .",
    "the results of the adjustments discussed above reflect the disagreement of the nist-07 watt - balance value for @xmath1293 , and to a lesser extent that of the similar nist-98 value , items @xmath2206 and @xmath1307 , with the iac-11 enriched silicon value of @xmath24 , item @xmath1419 ; and the disagreement of the nist-89 result for @xmath2670(lo ) , and to a lesser extent the kr / vn-98 result for @xmath1297 , items @xmath1289 and @xmath1296 , with the highly accurate values of @xmath13 . if adjustment 1 is repeated with these five data deleted , we find @xmath2671 and @xmath2672 .",
    "these values can be interpreted as confirming that @xmath2650 is consistent with 0 to within 1.6 times its uncertainty of @xmath2673 and that @xmath2649 is consistent with 0 well within its uncertainty of @xmath2674 .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly discussing recent efforts to close what is called the `` metrology triangle . '' although there are variants , the basic idea is to use a single electron tunneling ( set ) device that generates a quantized current @xmath2675 when an alternating voltage of frequency @xmath1260 is applied to it , where as usual @xmath3 is the elementary charge .",
    "the current @xmath1277 is then compared to a current derived from josephson and quantum hall effect devices . in view of quantization of charge in units of @xmath3 and conservation of charge",
    ", the equality of the currents shows that @xmath2676 , as expected , within the uncertainty of the measurements @xcite . although there is no indication from the results reported to date that this relation is not valid , the uncertainties of the results are at best at the 1 to 2 parts in @xmath679 level @xcite .",

    "further , the initial uncertainties of five input data , items @xmath1306 to @xmath1291 and @xmath2495 , are multiplied by the factor 2 , with the result that the absolute values of the normalized residuals @xmath2620 of the five data are less than 1.4 and their disagreement is reduced to an acceptable level .",

    "for example , if the 11 values of @xmath15 with expanded uncertainties are added to the 148 input data of adjustment 3 , @xmath15 is taken as an additional adjusted constant so that these 11 values can be included in a new adjustment using the observational equation @xmath3063 , and the so - modified adjustment 3 is repeated , then we find for this `` grand final adjustment '' that @xmath3064 , @xmath3065 , @xmath3066 , @xmath3067 , @xmath3068 , and @xmath12 .",
