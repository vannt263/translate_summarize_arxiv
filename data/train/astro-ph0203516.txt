    "various searches for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) have found signals having all of the expected characteristics of hypothesized et transmitters , except one .",
    "the candidate signals are narrowband , often are in or near a `` magic frequency '' in a `` special '' reference frame ( e.g. , the galactic barycenter ) , do not match the characteristics of known , interfering signals of terrestrial or solar system origin , and yet , do not repeat when follow - up observations of the relevant sky positions are performed . among the relevant programs are the megachannel extraterrestrial assay ( meta , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter @xcite ) , which found several dozen such signals at  1420 and  2840  mhz , and the old ohio state seti program @xcite , which found the `` wow ! ''",
    "signal at  1420  mhz .",
    "( the serendip programs [ @xcite ] define candidate signals as those that have been detected multiple times at the same sky position , but only modest efforts have been made to analyze these candidates further and it is not clear yet if these candidates can be eliminated as intrinsically steady sources in the way that the meta candidates are below . )",
    "by contrast with such an idealized type of signal , it is easy to imagine that received signals might depart significantly from this idealization , particularly with regard to duration and amplitude stability .",
    "( @xcite , hereinafter @xcite ) listed ( possibly incompletely ) reasons for a received signal to appear intermittent :    1 .",
    "noise in the receiver electronics , e.g. , thermal noise , cosmic ray induced events , and hardware failures ; 2 .   radio frequency interference ( rfi )",
    "whose origin is terrestrial , from earth orbit , or from interplanetary spacecraft ; 3 .",
    "natural , extrinsic modulation of a ( unknown ) class of narrowband astrophysical sources such as that caused by interstellar ( radio ) scintillation ( iss ) or gravitational lensing ; 4 .",
    "natural , extrinsic modulation of eti sources ; and 5 .",
    "intrinsic intermittency at the source of an eti signal due to natural causes , such as planetary rotation or the nature of the transmission ( e.g. , planetary radar ) or , for deliberate reasons , to frustrate detection and decryption by non - target civilizations .",
    "they then proceeded to analyze the impact of cause  4 upon seti surveys , with particular emphasis on iss , motivated by the following considerations .",
    "first , it seems to be the simplest mechanism for producing transient signals from otherwise intrinsically steady signals that is amenable to testing .",
    "second , observations of pulsars and active galactic nuclei have demonstrated that iss is important at centimeter wavelengths @xcite that are commonly used in searches for @xcite .",
    "@xcite were able to show that iss _ by itself _",
    "is sufficient to explain the lack of confirmation of any eti candidate signals in surveys conducted to date .",
    "they also predicted the sensitivities required to rule out the scintillation modulation hypothesis .    this paper reports new observations of nine of the eleven meta candidates , observations with the requisite sensitivity to allow iss to be ruled out . in ",

    "meta conducted five surveys of the northern sky , three at the frequency 1420  mhz and two at  2840  mhz , between  1986 and  1991 . at each sky position observed , two polarizations were searched in each of three reference frames  the local standard of rest , the galactic barycenter , and the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the vast majority of the signals analyzed were consistent with an exponential distribution as expected for noise from a fourier transform spectrometer .    of the roughly @xmath0 observations analyzed during the five - year meta ,",
    "only eleven could not be explained as due to either noise or processor failure , e.g. , due to cosmic - ray hits on the electronics .",
    "it was these eleven extrastatistical detections , four at  1420  mhz and seven at  2840  mhz , that @xcite identified as being candidates for detections of eti transmitters .",
    "all eleven candidates were narrowband , with the broadest being only four spectrometer channels wide ; each channel was 0.05  hz . some candidates were unresolved . during the survey ,",
    "the processing software could halt the survey observations and acquire reobservations on `` interesting '' signals within  40  s of detection .",
    "( the eleven candidates were identified only after the conclusion of meta so far more than just the eleven candidates were reobserved in this manner . ) in no case was a candidate reobserved during the immediate reobservations .",
    "furthermore , various followup observations were attempted over a five - year period , and no candidate was detected again .",
    "( intense scrutiny of the wow sky position has also failed to redetect a signal , @xcite )    with the exception of the lack of reobservation , the candidates had all of the characteristics expected of eti transmitters : narrowband signals in a celestial reference frame .",
    "the eleven extrastatistical candidates also all had low galactic latitudes , consistent with that expected for a galactic population .",
    "@xcite also considered the possibility that these candidates represent signals from a previously unrecognized class of natural sources . throughout the rest of this paper",

    "sufficiently distant radio sources ( @xmath28  kpc ) are in the saturated scintillation regime .",

    "the probability density function of the iss gain  @xmath31 is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the heaviside step function .",
    "a point discussed at length in @xcite and @xcite is the ancipital nature of this probability density function : scintillations can act to render an otherwise undetectable signal detectable , but because the most probable gain is @xmath34 , iss will more likely render undetectable an otherwise detectable signal .",
    "a key result of @xcite was the role of noise in .",

    "scintillations impact our observations in two ways .",
    "first , the original motivation in conducting the observations was to use detection thresholds low enough to rule out the scintillation hypothesis for the meta candidates .",
    "second , however , our use of the two telescopes means that a scintillating signal could be undetected in the reobservations with the telescope at woodbury .",

    "for all reasonable values of  @xmath63 , the redetection proabability for the project phoenix coincidence detection procedure is @xmath64 .",
    "if the scintillations are uncorrelated completely , @xmath65 , then @xmath66 can be evaluated analytically .",
    "@xmath67 for a source of strength comparable to that preferred by @xcite , @xmath68 .",
    "a strict _ lower _ limit to the detection probability is obtained by setting @xmath69 ( implying that no source is present ! ) for which @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the coincidence detection scheme is at least 99.6% robust in detecting actual scintillating sources of the source strength estimated by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we can place no reasonable limits on @xmath39 . in order for @xmath71 , the spatial scale length of the scintillations would have to be comparable to or smaller than the baseline between nrao and woodbury , @xmath72  km . at  1.4  ghz ( @xmath73  cm ) , such a scintillation scale length is equivalent to a scattering angle @xmath74 . while large , a scattering angle of this magnitude is not unprecedented .",
    "various low galactic latitude sources have scattering diameters comparable to or larger than this value ( e.g. , , @xcite ; , @xcite ) . as",
    "the meta candidates have low galactic latitudes as well , we can place no constraints on  @xmath39 .    in the roughly 10  yr between the meta observations and the observations we report (  [ sec : observe ] )",
    ", scintillations would have decorrelated completely . in this case",
    "the expression for @xmath66 is given in equation  ( [ eqn : pdproduct ] ) .",
    "for the meta reobservations , the reobservation threshold is that of the nrao telescope , @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 for a source strength comparable to that estimated by @xcite , and the lower limit is @xmath77 .    in order to find the overall probability of detection , we multiply the detection probability from the coincidence scheme with the redetection probability to the original meta observations , @xmath78 .",
    "the strict lower limit to the overall redetection probability ( @xmath69 ) is 97.8% , while it is in excess of  99.5% for a source strength comparable to that estimated by @xcite .",
    "these confidence levels are calculated using the nominal meta sensitivity .",
    "the actual sensitivity varied from @xmath79  w  m@xmath14 to @xmath80  w  m@xmath14 .",
    "@xcite do not report the appropriate value for each candidate .",
    "using the highest sensitivity reduces the overall redetection probability to @xmath81% while using the lowest sensitivity increases the overall redetection probability to @xmath82% .",
    "@xcite also show the number of ( uncorrelated ) reobservations required to exclude completely the possibility that the meta candidates were actual eti transmitters . in the case that @xmath83 , the number of reobservations required is 10 . because the maximum number of reobservations for any one candidate is only 3 ( at our sensitivity level )",
    ", we can not apply this second reality criterion .",
    "as a second extrinsic cause of signal modulation , we consider gravitational microlensing . in this scenario ,",
    "the continuous transmissions of an eti transmitter are amplified briefly by a foreground object passing close to the line of sight of the transmitter .",
    "this scenario was not covered by @xcite .",
    "gravitational microlensing has an apparent advantage over iss in that the amplification gain for microlensing  @xmath84 is @xmath85 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite consider the more general problem of detecting terrestrial planets via gravitational lensing .",
    "gravitational microlensing has been detected in optical monitoring programs of stars toward the galactic bulge , the magellanic clouds , and ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because gravitational effects are achromatic , we can make use of the formalism developed to describe these monitoring programs .",
    "we shall assume that neither source size nor source blending are important as both can contribute to apparent chromatic effects @xcite .",
    "given the observed signal strengths of the meta candidates and the reobservation thresholds in our new observations , the microlensing amplifications required are @xmath86 , somewhat smaller than the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "although we have not conducted extensive tests , a la @xcite , an important conclusion of @xcite continues to hold : the noise in the meta spectrometer would have played a key role in the initial detections , if these are otherwise constant signals .",
    "the decorrelation time scale of the noise , approximately 20  s , was a crucial feature of the signal model developed by @xcite .",
    "this short decorrelation time explained how the immediate reobservations conducted during meta were unable to detect the signal .",
    "like iss , the decorrelation time of gravitational microlensing , @xmath88  hr @xcite , is much longer than the time it took for the immediate reobservations to occur .",
    "thus , gravitational microlensing need not account for the full dynamic range @xmath87 .",
    "amplifications this large have been termed extreme gravitational lensing events ( egles ) or extreme magnification events ( emes ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the probability for the gravitational microlensing amplification to exceed a fiducial value  @xmath89 , @xmath90 . for @xmath91",
    "this function can be approximated as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the optical depth to microlensing .",
    "the exact values for @xmath93 depend upon the details of the population of lensing objects .",
    "existing estimates for the microlensing optical depth toward the inner galaxy are sufficient though to place severe constraints on the meta candidates .",
    "the optical depth toward the inner galaxy is @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "this estimate depends upon such factors as the mass function and galactic distribution of the lenses @xcite .",
    "in particular , the value can be lower by factors of several , depending upon the galactic coordinates of the line of sight .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , we ignore these differences . including these effects",
    "would make our conclusions more robust .    in order to explain the meta candidates , we require @xmath95 so that @xmath96 toward the inner galaxy . on average",
    ", we expect that in order to obtain an amplification as large as @xmath89 , the number of _ background _ objects , i.e. , eti transmitters , must be @xmath97 .",
    "the relevant quantity here is the number of background objects as the number of lenses has already been incorporated through the factor of @xmath93 in @xmath98 .",
    "we therefore require @xmath99 in order to explain the meta candidates as being real signals modulated by gravitational microlensing .",
    "@xcite estimate that if all of the meta candidates represent real signals , the galactic population of such transmitters is only roughly @xmath100 .",
    "the observed number of candidates is insufficient , by orders of magnitude , to allow them to be explained as gravitational microlensed transmitters .",
    "we can extend this analysis to future surveys as well .",
    "suppose that we consider lower amplification values .",
    "the number of transmitters required within the inner galaxy must still be @xmath101 for gravitational microlensing to be an important factor .",
    "this estimate for the gravitational lensing optical depth is for background sources located in the galactic bulge .",
    "we assume that these sources are located within a galactocentric radius @xmath102  kpc",
    ". then the surface density of such transmitters must be @xmath103 , assuming a disk - like distribution of transmitters .",
    "we have assumed a disk - like distribution of transmitters based on the apparent concentration of meta candidates to the galactic plane . extending this distribution into the galactic disk , the average distance between the eti transmitters would be roughly @xmath104 . given that programs such as the seti institute s project phoenix have not detected any transmissions from nearby stars ,",
    "this surface density is far higher than the actual surface density .",
    "we conclude that gravitational microlensing is unlikely to play an important role in modulating the signals from eti transmitters within the galaxy , unless there are populations of disk and inner galaxy eti transmitters whose densities differ significantly .",
    "we have reported additional , more sensitive observations of nine of the eleven extrastatistical candidates from the megachannel extraterrestrial assay ( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",
    "we have used these observations to evaluate the most simple hypothesis amenable to testing ( @xcite ) : that the extrastatistical candidates were intrinsically steady sources , either extraterrestrial transmitters or an as - yet unknown population of narrowband natural sources , whose intensities were amplified by propagation effects , either interstellar scintillations (  [ sec : iss ] ) or gravitational microlensing (  [ sec : micro ] ) .    using the formalism developed in @xcite ( with a correction for the second detection probability , equation  [ eqn : p2d ] ) ,",
    "we have shown that these more sensitive limits exclude the scintillation hypothesis : the meta candidates do not in general represent a population of scintillating sources .",
    "this hypothesis can be excluded at a confidence level of at least 97.8% ( for the case of an intrinsically weak source ) to a level in excess of  99% ( if the source strengths are comparable to that favored by @xcite ) .",
    "because two of the meta candidates were not reobserved with this sensitivity , we can not rule out the possibility that one or both of them represent eti transmitters .",
    "we have also shown that the number of transmitters in the inner galaxy would have to approach @xmath105 if gravitational microlensing is to be invoked to account for the meta candidates .",
    "current constraints on the number of transmitters in the galaxy are orders of magnitude smaller than this number .",
    "furthermore , existing surveys already suggest that the galactic population of eti transmitters is sufficiently small so that gravitational microlensing is unlikely to play a role in future surveys .",
    "@xcite derived various limits on various populations of transmitters .",
    "these limits can be revisited in light of our results ( see figure  10 of @xcite ) : there is no more than 1 kardashev type  ii civilization that has constructed an isotropic beacon near the line or its second harmonic within the galaxy or nearest @xmath106 galaxies .",
    "there are no more than @xmath107 kardashev type  i civilizations broadcasting isotropically within the galaxy and no more than 1 such civilization with a directed beacon transmitter having 30  db or more gain anywhere within the galaxy .",
    "more stringent limits on weaker transmissions will have to await future surveys ."
