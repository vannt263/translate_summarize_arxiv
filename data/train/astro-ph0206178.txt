    "these multiple planet systems contain planets reported to range from a saturn mass to nearly 10 jupiter mass , all orbiting within 4 au .",
    "interactions between the planets in some of these systems , notably gliese 876 , are measurable on a time scale of a few years ( lissauer & rivera 2001 ; laughlin & chambers 2001 ; rivera & lissauer 2001 ) .",
    "doppler measurements can reveal the ongoing gravitational perturbations and constrain both the planet masses and orbital inclinations .",

    "a most extraordinary double planet system was reported for hd 83443 ( mayor et al .",
    "their doppler measurements made with the coralie spectrometer indicate the existence of two saturn  mass planets that both reside within 0.2 au .",
    "the inner planet has an orbital period of 2.985 d , an eccentricity of 0.079 ( @xmath00.033 ) , a minimum ( @xmath1 ) mass of 0.34 m@xmath2 , and an orbital distance of 0.038 au .",

    "this outer planet induces a velocity semiamplitude in the star of @xmath3 = 13.8 @xmath0 1 , rendering it a 14-@xmath4 detection . this planet has the smallest @xmath1yet reported , and is only the third reported planet with a semiamplitude smaller than 15 ( cf .",
    "marcy et al . 2000 ; fischer et al . 2002 ) .    both of the planets were indicated by doppler measurements obtained with the 1.2-m leonhard euler telescope at the eso la silla observatory , which feeds the coralie spectrometer ( queloz et al .",
    "wavelength calibration is achieved by coupling the telescope and thorium lamp to the spectrometer with a double scrambled fiber .",
    "the quoted instrumental precision is now 2 ( udry et al . 2002 ) .",
    "as the two planets orbiting hd 83443 are crowded within 0.2 au , the system is dynamically active .",
    "calculations by j.laskar and w.benz ( reported in mayor et al .",
    "2000 ) and by wu & goldreich ( 2002 ) and lee & peale ( 2002b ) suggest the occurrence of significant gravitational interactions between the two planets .",
    "the tidal circularization time scale for the inner planet to hd 83443 is estimated to be @xmath5 yr ( wu & goldreich 2002 ) , while the star is estimated to have an age of 6.5 gyr . in this context , the non ",
    "zero eccentricity of the inner planet and the apside alignment of the two orbits are understood to be due to secular interactions between the two planets and tidal interactions with the star ( mayor et al .",
    "2000 ; wu & goldreich 2002 ) .",
    "these in turn constrain the orbital inclination of this system , and the radius of the inner planet ( wu & goldreich 2002 ) . the dynamical evolution that led to the system may involve migration and resonances ( lee & peale 2002b ) .",
    "section 2 of this paper will describe new doppler measurements of hd 83443 made from the keck and aat telescopes .",

    "our failure to detect the outer planet is discussed in section 4 .",
    "hd 83443 ( hip47202 ) is among the fainter g & k dwarfs surveyed by precision doppler programs with v = 8.23 and b@xmath6v=0.811 ( perryman et al .",

    "australian precision doppler survey in feb 1999 .",
    "this is among the very faintest stars in the aat survey .",
    "ten minute exposures on the 3.9m anglo  australian telescope yield typical s / n @xmath970 , giving a median measurement uncertainty of 8.0 ( butler et al . 2001 ) . a total of 16 aat observations of hd 83443 have been made between feb 1999 and mar 2002 .",
    "hd 83443 was added to the keck precision doppler survey ( vogt et al .",
    "2000 ) in dec 2000 as a result of the coralie announcement of a double planet system .",
    "a total of 20 keck observations have been obtained through mar 2002 .",
    "the aat and keck velocity measurements are listed in table 1 .",
    "we fit the velocities with a simple keplerian model for which the usual free parameters are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath3 , as well as a system velocity zero point , @xmath14 .",

    "figure 3 shows the combined set of velocities phased .",
    "figure 1 shows that a single keplerian model , without invoking a second planet , yields a fit to the keck velocities with an rms of 4 . while this strongly confirms the inner planet , the low rms is surprising because the reported second planet causes a semiamplitude of 13.8 ( mayor et al . 2000 ) , but is not included in this single ",
    "keplerian fit .",
    "similarly the aat velocities are well fit , within measurement uncertainty , with a single keplerian model , as shown in figure 2",
    ".    the combined velocities from keck and aat ( figure 3 ) can also be fit with a single keplerian model , and yield a semiamplitude k = 57 , an orbital eccentricity @xmath12 = 0.05 , and yield a minimum ( @xmath1 ) mass of 0.34 m@xmath2 .",
    "here we have adopted a stellar mass of 0.79 m@xmath16  ( mayor et al .",
    "the actual stellar mass is probably closer to 1.0 m@xmath16  after accounting properly for the high metalicity of the star .",
    "the rms to this keplerian fit for the combined keck and aat observations is 8.1 , and the corresponding reduced @xmath15 is 1.39 .",
    "figure 4 shows the residuals to the single keplerian fit to the combined keck and aat data .",
    "the rms of the residuals are 3.8 and 10.6 respectively for the keck and aat observations .",
    "the keplerian orbital parameters derived from the separate and combined keck and aat observations are listed in table 2 , along with the orbital parameters from the geneva web page for both of the planets 83443 announced from the coralie data ] .",
    "the orbital parameters for the inner planet , hd 83443b , derived from the keck and aat data sets are in good agreement with the coralie result , differing primarily in that the keck ",
    "aat orbit is nearly circular , within measurement uncertainty , as are the other extrasolar planets within 0.05 au .",
    "the median internal uncertainty of the keck observations is 2.8 .",
    "based on the ca ii h & k lines , we measure the chromospheric diagnostic @xmath17 of hd 83443 to be ,",
    "log(r@xmath18 ) = -4.85 .",
    "the doppler velocity `` jitter '' associated with this level of activity for a k0 v star is 3.0 ( saar et al .",
    "1998 ; saar & fischer 2000 , santos et al .",
    "2000b ) . adding the doppler `` jitter '' in quadrature with the measurement uncertainty of 3 produces an expected keplerian rms to the keck data of 4.1 ,",
    "which is consistent with the observed rms of 3.8 .",
    "the aat and keck data sets have independent and arbitrary velocity zero  points .",
    "the velocity offset between these two data sets was thus left as an additional free parameter in the combined keplerian fit . as this velocity zero  point is dependent on the model used to fit the data , it is not possible to use the combined data set to search for multiple periodicities .",
    "as the keck data has both better phase coverage and significantly higher precision than the aat data , we have intensely searched the keck velocity set for evidence of a second planet with a period of 29.83 d. however we also searched the aat velocities for the second planet , yielding similar results as from the keck data .",
    "periodogram analysis ( scargle 1982 ; gilliland & baliunas 1987 ) reveals a strong periodicity near 3 days for both the keck and aat data sets .",
    "figure 5a ( top panel ) shows the periodogram for the keck data .",
    "the highest peak is the 2.986 period .",
    "the dotted line is the 1% false alarm level .",
    "there remain no other significant peaks , notably near 29.83 d. as a strong primary peak can hide secondary peaks ( butler et al .",
    "1999 ) , we have removed the primary peak by subtracting off the best ",
    "fit keplerian from figure 3 .",
    "figure 5b ( lower panel ) shows the periodogram of the keck velocity residuals from figure 4 .",
    "no significant peaks remain .",
    "we considered the possibility that a 29.8 d periodicity in our velocities , caused by an outer planet , might have been missed in the keck data due to the temporal sampling of velocity measurements .",
    "the observational window function may cause blind spots at certain periods . to test this possibility , we constructed 1000 artificial velocity sets .",
    "the fake velocities were calculated from the keplerian orbital parameters of both planets by simply adding the motion of the star caused by each planet .",
    "we adopted the orbital parameters for both planets from mayor et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , listed here in table 2 as planets `` b '' and `` c '' . in the simulation , we sampled the reflex velocity of the star at the times of the 20 keck observations listed in table 1 .",
    "in addition , random noise with an rms of 4.0 was added to each of these artificial data set to simulate the combined effects of doppler `` jitter '' and the keck measurement errors .",
    "each of these fake data sets was then fit with a single least  squares keplerian , and the rms to this single keplerian fit was recorded .",
    "a histogram of rms to the resulting single keplerian fits is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the rms of these fits range from 6.7 to 14.0 .",
    "the median rms to the single keplerian fit is 10.3 . in contrast , the rms of the single keplerian fit to the actual keck data is 3.8 , as indicated by the arrow in figure 6 .",
    "since none of our 1000 artificial velocity sets could be adequately fit with a single keplerian model , the supposed outer planet , if it exists , would similarly not permit an adequate fit with a single keplerian model . thus there is less than 0.1% probability that the outer planet can hide in our actual velocities .",
    "we conclude that the window function of the keck observations would not prevent the detection of the outer planet to hd 83443 .",
    "such an outer planet , if it existed , should have caused an excess rms in the velocity residuals of @xmath910 when fit by single keplerian .",
    "such velocity residuals are not seen .",
    "it remains possible that the period of the outer planet of hd 83443 might be slightly different from that given on the coralie web page .",
    "if this were so and the window function of the keck observations were unfortunately aligned , it might still be possible that the outer planet could be lurking in the keck data set . to test this",
    ", we have fit the keck data set with a double keplerian , using as the input guess the double keplerian parameters from the coralie web page ( listed in table 2 ) .",
    "the period , eccentricity , and velocity semiamplitude of the inner and outer inner planets have been frozen at the reported values of the supposed outer planet , but the remaining keplerian parameters including time of periastron and @xmath13 have been allowed to float .",
    "outer planet periods ranging from 28 to 32 d were systematically attempted in steps of 0.001 d. figure 7 shows the resulting best  fit reduced @xmath15 for each of the trial periods .",
    "the arrow indicates the location of the 29.83 d period , which yields best  fit reduced @xmath15 of 2.31 , much worse than the single keplerian fit to the keck data set with reduced @xmath15 of 1.33 .    to estimate the largest semiamplitude allowed by the keck velocities for a planet in a @xmath930 d orbit",
    ", we again fit the keck data with a double keplerian as in figure 7 , but this time allowed the velocity semiamplitude of the outer planet to float .",
    "figure 8 shows this best ",
    "fit semiamplitude for a potential outer planet having orbital periods ranging from 28 to 32 d. at 29.83 d , the best ",
    "fit amplitude is 2.8 .",
    "the keck data rule out any periodicities between 29 and 31 days with an amplitude greater than 3 .",
    "given the temporal sampling of the keck data , it remains possible to hide a 13.8 semiamplitude with a period near 27.7 d from the current keck data set .",
    "this is @xmath910 @xmath4 removed from the coralie period of 29.83 d.",
    "precision doppler observations made with the 10m keck and the 3.9m aat strongly confirm the existence of the inner planet orbiting hd 83443 , and indicate the orbital parameters are in very good agreement with those reported by mayor et al .",
    "the present orbital parameters differ only marginally in that the orbit of the inner planet is circular within measurement uncertainty for the keck and aat data , similar to the other known close  in planets .",
    "but our doppler measurements did not detect the 29.8 d outer planet , despite the clear ability to do so .",
    "the present measurements impose a limit on any such velocity periodicity at a level of no more than 3 , well below the reported velocity amplitude of 13.8 .",
    "orbital periods within 2 days of 29.8 d would have been detected .",
    "the supposed velocity amplitude of 13.8 is four times larger than the uncertainties in our velocity measurements rendering the outer planet immediately detectable .",
    "various tests suggest quantitatively that the velocities should have revealed the outer planet .",
    "the velocities from the keck and aat telescopes could have independently detected the outer planet , but neither data set revealed it .",
    "we considered various possible reasons that we failed to detect the outer planet .",
    "one possibility is that some interactive resonance between the two planets causes the reflex velocity of the star to mimic insidiously a single keplerian orbit .",
    "that is , perhaps the 10:1 ratio of orbital periods , along with gravitational interactions , yields a final reflex velocity that traces a single keplerian velocity curve .",
    "if so , we might be fooled into fitting the velocities with such a simple model .",
    "we find this possibility unlikely . as shown by w. benz ( mayor et al .",
    "2000 ) and by wu & goldreich ( 2002 ) , the gravitational interactions yield temporal evolution of the orbits on a time scale of @xmath91000 yr rather than a few years .",
    "thus we expect the outer planet , if it exists , to remain in a coherent orbit during the few year duration of the present observations .",
    "moreover , the 10:1 ratio of the two periods do not constitute a powerful fourier harmonic from which a single keplerian may be constructed ( as is the case with a 2:1 ratio of periods ) .      of the 75 extrasolar planet candidates ( @xmath1@xmath19 13 m@xmath2 ) announced from precision doppler surveys ] ,",
    "a total of 57 have been published in refereed journals .",
    "these planets are listed in table 3 , which also notes the telescope from which the data originates , and whether the actual doppler velocities are publicly available . refereed precision velocity confirmations are also included .",
    "substellar candidates found by other techniques such as astrometry and low precision doppler velocities are not included .",
    "an additional 4 planet candidates have been announced in conference proceedings ( queloz et al .",
    "2000b ; sivan et al .",
    "doppler velocity measurements are not available for candidates that have only been published in conference proceedings .",
    "an additional 12 claimed doppler planets , all of which were announced more than 1 year ago , have not been submitted to either a conference proceeding or a refereed journal .",
    "while the discovery of extrasolar planets has become seemingly commonplace over the past 6 years , we still consider the detection of planets orbiting other stars as extraordinary , and as such worthy of the dictum , `` extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . ''",
    "publishing discovery data in a refereed journal remains a crucial part of the process , though this is not in itself sufficient to establish the credibility of a planet claim .",
    "it remains extremely likely that at least a handful of the reported planets do not in fact exist .",
    "multiple confirmation both by independent precision doppler teams and by completely independent techniques remain the only means by which to ensure the veracity of extrasolar planet claims .",

    "<S> the geneva group has reported two saturn  mass planets orbiting hd 83443 ( k0v ) with periods of 2.98 and 29.8 d. the two planets have raised interest in their dynamics because of the possible 10:1 orbital resonance and the strong gravitational interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we report precise doppler measurements of hd 83443 obtained with the keck / hires and the aat / ucles spectrometers . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements strongly confirm the inner planet with period of 2.985 d , with orbital parameters in very good agreement with those of the geneva group . </S>",
    "<S> however these doppler measurements show no evidence of the outer planet , at thresholds of 1/4 ( 3 ) of the reported velocity amplitude of 13.8 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the existence of the outer planet is in question . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the current doppler measurements reveal no evidence of any second planet with periods less than a year . </S>"
