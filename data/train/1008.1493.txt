    "since the discovery of room temperature ( rt ) large tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs),@xcite intensive research has been carried out on this subject .",
    "this is due in large part to the various potential technological applications utilizing the high tmr performance,@xcite which is quickly approaching the theoretically predicted value of over 1000% in fe / mgo / fe mtj structure.@xcite recently , a tmr value of 605% was reported in a pseudo spin valve annealed at high temperature @xcite and a record high tmr value of 1056% in a double barrier mtj structure.@xcite however , the performance of mtjs is well known to be very sensitive to fabrication conditions , and significant challenges remain for fabrication of reliable high quality mtjs . among those challenges ,",
    "one critical step is the formation of oxide tunnel barrier in between the two fm metallic electrodes .",
    "the oxidation step needs precise control due to the small thickness of the barrier , which is usually less than 2 nm , and the unwanted surface oxidation of the bottom fm electrode .",
    "if the barrier is under - oxidized , the leftover metal could significantly diminish the tunneling by providing hopping conductance for electrons within the barrier . on the other hand ,",
    "if the barrier is over - oxidized , oxidation of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) electrode could occur and it is severely detrimental to the spin polarization at the electrode / barrier interface.@xcite in the current stage of development , most ferromagnetic electrodes used in the mtj structures are co rich alloys such as cofe and cofeb . in the case of barrier over - oxidation , the bottom electrode surface will be oxidized to form antiferromagnetic coo at the bottom electrode / barrier interface .",
    "when such a system is field - cooled from rt through the nel temperature of coo ( 293 k ) , a typical coo / fm exchange - bias ( eb ) system is established.@xcite in this study , the eb system is utilized as an indicator of barrier over - oxidation . specifically , we identify four parameters associated with the observation of eb as the detection parameters of barrier over - oxidation , including the eb field ( @xmath0 ) , training effect , uncompensated spin density , and coercivity ( @xmath1 ) of the bottom electrode .",
    "a comparison of the detection sensitivities for these four parameters shows that @xmath1 is most sensitive to the over - oxidation due to its very pronounced increase at low temperature .",
    "our study also shows that annealing at high temperature would help an oxygen remigration from the electrode oxidized surface to the mgo barrier , in agreement with previously reported results obtained by advanced spectroscopic methods.@xcite we propose that the magnetic measurements and analyses developed in this study can serve as a simple and effective method for detecting the tunnel barrier oxidation quality during the mtj fabrication process .",
    "in particular , it will be a useful tool for identifying the process windows when exploring new oxide barrier materials other than the well established al@xmath2o@xmath3 and mgo .",

    "the inset of ( b ) shows the general structure of the partial mtj stacks used in this study.,width=240 ]    the partial mtj stacks used in this study were deposited using a biased target ion beam deposition ( btibd ) system @xcite with the base pressure of @xmath52@xmath610@xmath7 torr and the processing pressure of @xmath57@xmath610@xmath8 torr ( equivalent to 80 sccm ar flow during deposition ) .",
    "an initial magnetic easy axis of the fm layers was set by a magnetic field of 50 oe applied parallel to the plane of the film in situ during the film growth .",
    "the studied partial mtj structure , as shown in the inset of fig . 1 ( b ) , is : substrate / ta(6)/fm(5)/mgo(2.4 , post - oxidation)/ta(6 ) ; here , the thickness units are in nm , the substrate is thermally oxidized silicon , and the bottom fm electrode material is either co@xmath9fe@xmath10 or co@xmath11fe@xmath12b@xmath12 .",

    "the reference samples , substrate / ta(6)/fm(5)/mg(2.4)/ta(6 ) , were fabricated with similar structures as the oxidized ones except without a plasma oxidation step ( i.e. , @xmath14 s ) . to investigate the influence of annealing on the magnetic properties , the samples were annealed at two different temperatures ( 200 @xmath15c and 350 @xmath15c ) in an external field of 3 koe applied parallel to the film plane .",
    "the samples were entirely protected from further oxidation during annealing by a continuously flowing forming gas ( 95% n@xmath2 + 5% h@xmath2 ) .",
    "magnetic properties were measured using a quantum design ppms-6000 system at both room temperature ( rt ) and 11 k. for the low temperature measurements , all of the samples were field - cooled from rt with an applied magnetic field of 3 koe along their easy axes .",

    "it is noticeable that the first cycling irregular shaped loop with extremely large @xmath0 and @xmath1 is known as due to the training effect of typical eb systems.@xcite the system becomes stable only after the second field cycle illustrated by a near coincidence of the second and third cycling loops . to quantify the training effect",
    ", we define a `` training ratio '' ( @xmath16 ) that describes the magnitude of the effect : @xmath23\\times100\\%$ ] , where @xmath24 is the training field that is determined as the coercivity measured on the first demagnetization branch of the first cycling @xmath21(@xmath4 ) loop as indicated in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "after the second field cycle , the training effect almost ends and the @xmath21(@xmath4 ) loops go back to the regular shape where the eb field is conventionally determined as @xmath25 , and the coercivity as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the positive and negative fields , respectively , at which @xmath29 .",

    "it has been generally believed that highly anisotropic uncompensated spins at the fm / afm interface are responsible for unidirectionally pinning the fm layer.@xcite the net magnetization of uncompensated spins , in principle , causes a vertical shift along the @xmath21-axis to the hysteresis loop .",

    "interestingly , @xmath17 is quite obvious in our samples with long oxidation times .",

    "all measurements were performed at 11 k.,width=211 ]    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show a clear trend for all the parameters : almost no change for very short oxidation times , but substantial increases in all of the parameters with sufficiently prolonged @xmath13 .",
    "these variations of the parameters are therefore clear evidences for the formation of the cofe / coo or cofeb / coo interface caused by the barrier over - oxidation at long @xmath13 . for each considered parameter ,",
    "the oxidation time threshold where it starts to increase can be considered as the boundary between under- and over - oxidation of the mg barrier .",
    "our observations clearly show that all the four eb related parameters presented in our study can be employed effectively for detecting the bottom fm electrode surface oxidation .",
    "the oxidation time threshold slightly varies among these parameters , indicating that they may have different sensitivities with the bottom electrode oxidation .    to detect the barrier layer over - oxidation that causes the bottom electrode",
    "to be partially oxidized , one apparent approach would be to compare the saturation magnetization of the oxidized sample to the reference one .",
    "if the surface of the fm bottom electrode gets oxidized to form non - fm oxides , its total fm moment must be reduced . indeed , a reduced magnetic moment of the sample with over - oxidation of mgo layer [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] was observed when compared to the reference sample loop measured at rt ( not shown ) .",
    "however , this parameter of reduced moment is not pursued in this study due to the significant inaccuracy in normalizing the film s surface area and the fact that this parameter is not directly related to the eb phenomenon .",
    "the eb parameters appear to have different sensitivities with the oxidation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for the sample set with cofe electrodes ,",
    "when decreasing oxidation time from 90 seconds , the @xmath0 of corresponding samples starts to drop quickly and becomes almost zero on the sample with @xmath33 s. the training effect almost disappears in the sample with @xmath34 s while @xmath17 is still measurable even with only 10 s oxidation .",
    "coercivity seems to be the most sensitive parameter ; an enhanced coercivity ( comparing to the @xmath14 s reference sample ) due to the eb could still be clearly observed even with only 5 seconds of oxidation .",
    "this enhanced coercivity indicates that the mgo barrier was still slightly over - oxidized ( even with only 5 s oxidation ) , leading to the surface oxidation of the bottom cofe electrode at the mgo / cofe interface and the formation of the coo / cofe eb system .",
    "qualitatively , the data from the cofeb - electrode oxidized samples present a similar trend in terms of detection sensitivities among those four parameters .",
    "the results from both sets of samples show that the coercivity is the most sensitive parameter to detect the presence of eb formation , followed by the uncompensated spin density @xmath17 , the training ratio @xmath16 , and finally the eb field @xmath0 . by measuring these parameters",
    ", one can quickly examine the oxidation state of the cofeb or any other co rich fm electrode underneath the oxide barrier , providing the optimization of the tunnel barrier oxidation with simplicity without the characterization of the completed mtj structure with microfabrication process or other sophisticated techniques .",
    "( 11k)/@xmath1(rt ) for as - deposited and annealed samples as functions of plasma oxidation time exhibiting a gradual decrease with increasing the annealing temperature.,width=211 ]    for mtjs with mgo barrier , it is necessary to anneal the samples in order to obtain crystallized mgo(001 ) for high spin filtering efficiency.@xcite previous study of cofeb / mgo bilayer using x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) not only confirmed the process - dependent formation of coo at the cofeb / mgo interface , which is similar to our findings using this over - oxidation detection method , but also unveiled the reduction of such oxidation during the vacuum annealing process.@xcite to verify the existence of similar oxidation reduction in our samples using the eb detection parameters after the heat treatment , the sample set with cofeb bottom electrode , including both the reference sample and the oxidized samples , was annealed for one hour at two different temperatures 200 @xmath15c and 350 @xmath15c .",
    "magnetometry measurements were then performed on the annealed samples as well as on those as - deposited ones and the obtained results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . after the annealing treatments , both at 200 @xmath15c and 350 @xmath15c , except the @xmath1 ,",
    "all other parameters become almost the same as those of the reference sample .",
    "this observed reduction of @xmath0 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 values serves as a clear indication of the deoxidation state of the bottom cofeb electrode after the annealing , which suggests that during the annealing process , oxygen atoms at the cofeb oxidized surface may have diffused back to the mgo barrier , decreasing the amount of coo and therefore weakening the coo / cofeb exchange coupling .",
    "this result is in good agreement with previous studies using xps and similar magnetometry measurements.@xcite    one thing worth noting here is the larger @xmath1 of the samples annealed at 350 @xmath15c compared to those at 200 @xmath15c .",
    "this coercivity enhancement is probably due to the crystallization of the cofeb film ; it obscures the annealing effect on the underlying eb coupling and the oxidation state at the interface . to further clarify the influence of annealing on the coercivity , it s normalized value , @xmath1(11k)/@xmath1(rt ) ,",
    "is plotted against @xmath13 in fig .",
    "the result clearly shows that the cofeb surface oxidation is not completely reversed after the one hour annealing at 200 @xmath15c , and the eb coupling still exists in all of the oxidation samples .",
    "however , after the annealing at 350 @xmath15c , all the oxidation samples show almost identical @xmath1 as the reference one , indicating a disappearance of the cofeb surface oxidation and therefore the exchange bias when most of the oxygen atoms have been absorbed by the mgo barrier .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the annealing study of mtjs with mgo barriers where it was found that , within a certain temperature range , higher temperature annealing usually yields better tmr performances.@xcite in addition , the annealing effect study also confirms that among the four detection parameters , coercivity @xmath1 is the most sensitive probe for detecting the bottom electrode oxidation in the mtj fabrication process .",
    "in summary , we have developed a simple method of detecting the surface oxidation of the bottom fm electrode due to an over - oxidation of the mgo barrier layer that can be used as a generic detection method to explore the oxidation process window of various barrier materials regardless of their types .",
    "four different oxidation detection parameters were identified , including the newly defined training ratio , @xmath16 , which can all be used to monitor the exchange bias formation .",
    "while the exchange bias field @xmath0 itself is not detectable at short oxidation times , the enhanced coercivity due to the exchange bias formation appears to be most sensitive .",
    "our study of the annealing effect on these four parameters confirmed the oxygen restoration to the barrier material , which is consistent with the results from previous studies using different experimental techniques .    this work has been performed with financial support from ucr / dmea under grant no .",
