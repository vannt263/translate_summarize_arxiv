    "effective interactions have been extensively used in transport codes to gain knowledge about nuclear matter properties in conditions far from equilibrium .",
    "they predict very different behaviours for some physical properties , such as the momentum dependence of the mean field in the iso - scalar and iso - vector channel ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "in general , the momentum dependence of the potential is strictly related to the concept of in - medium reduction of the nucleon mass . in particular , the non - local part of the symmetry potential has become an interesting subject of investigation , because it leads to a splitting of the masses of different nucleonic species in asymmetric matter , and the sign of this splitting already is an open and controversial problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "considering separately the local and non - local contributions to the potential part of the symmetry energy , a sharp change is observed , for instance , going from the earlier skyrme forces to the lyon parametrizations , with almost an inversion of the signs of the two contributions @xcite .",
    "the important repulsive non - local part of the lyon forces leads to a completely different behavior of the neutron matter @xmath2 , of great relevance for the neutron star properties .",
    "actually this substantially modified parametrization was mainly motivated by a very unpleasant feature in the spin channel of the earlier skyrme forces , the collapse of polarized neutron matter @xcite . in correspondence",
    "the predictions on isospin effects on the momentum dependence of the symmetry term are quite different .",
    "a very important consequence for the reaction dynamics is the expected inversion of the sign of the @xmath3 effective mass splitting , i.e. in the lyon forces neutron effective masses are below the proton ones for n - rich matter .",
    "we note that the same is predicted from microscopic relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( @xmath4 ) calculations @xcite and in general from the introduction of scalar isovector virtual mesons in relativistic mean field ( @xmath5 ) approaches @xcite . at variance ,",
    "non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( @xmath6 ) calculations are leading to opposite conclusions @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison between relativistic effective ( @xmath7 ) masses and non - relativistic effective masses requires some attention , see the ch.6 of @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "in fact , though the neutron @xmath7-mass is below the proton one , in correspondence the non - relativistic @xmath8-mass splitting can have any sign .",
    "indeed this is just the case of the very recent @xmath4 analysis of the tbingen group @xcite .",
    "such puzzling effect is related to the intrinsic momentum dependence of the nucleon self - energies , it is then beyond the @xmath5 approach and it represents a very sensitive test of the treatment of dirac - brueckner correlations .",
    "all that clearly shows that sensitive experimental observables are largely needed",
    ".    the sign of the splitting will directly affect the energy dependence of the so - called lane potential , i.e. the difference between @xmath9 optical potentials on charge asymmetric targets , normalized by the target asymmetry @xcite .",
    "a decreasing behaviour is observed in the case @xmath10 , while a positive slope is obtained in the opposite case .",
    "an important physical consequence of the negative slopes is that the isospin effects on the optical potentials tend to disappear at energies just above @xmath11 ( or even change the sign for `` old '' skyrme - like forces ) .",
    "also , we expect a crossing of the two prescriptions at low energies , i.e. low momentum nucleons will see exactly the same lane potentials , as shown in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "unfortunately results derived from neutron / proton optical potentials at low energies are not conclusive @xcite , since the effects due to the mass splitting appear of the same order of the uncertainty on the determination of the local contribution to the symmetry energy .",
    "moreover at low energies , due to the crossing discussed before , it is difficult to appreciate differences between positive or negative slopes .",
    "a positive slope is obtained , for instance , within the phenomenological dirac optical potential ( @xmath12 ) , with different implicit momemtum dependences in the self - energies @xcite .",
    "this potential has been constructed fitting simultaneously proton and neutron ( mostly total cross sections ) data for collisions with a wide range of nuclei at energies up to @xmath11 .",
    "recently such dirac optical potential has been proven to reproduce very well the new neutron scattering data on @xmath13 at @xmath14 @xcite measured at the svendberg laboratory in uppsala .",
    "more data are needed at higher energies ( around / above @xmath11 ) , to improve the systematics , in order to clearly disentangle between the two trends of the lane potential and of the effective mass splitting .",
    "we note however that these properties of the interaction will also affect the dynamical evolution of heavy ion collisions .",
    "so we can get indipendent information about it just by looking at some suitable reaction observables .",
    "we can expect important effects on transport properties ( fast particle emission , collective flows ) of the dense and asymmetric @xmath15 that will be reached in radioactive beam collisions at intermediate energies .    here",
    "we will focus on the study of pre - equilibrium emission in neutron - rich central collisions , at 50 and 100 mev / a .",
    "we will see that the energy dependence of the n / z content of fast emitted particles is particularly sensitive to the sign of the effective mass splitting .",
    "hence it would be possible to answer many fundamental questions in isospin physics by looking at appropriate observables in intermediate energy @xmath16 .",
    "in order to directly test the influence of the @xmath8-effective mass splitting we will present results from reaction dynamics at intermediate energies analysed in a non - relativistic transport approach , of @xmath17 type , see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 effective interaction is derived via an asymmetric extension of the @xmath19 force @xcite .",
    "the energy density can be parametrized as follows ( see also @xcite,@xcite ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the usual kinetic energy density and @xmath22 the variable @xmath23 defines the isospin content of the system , given the number of neutrons @xmath24 , protons @xmath25 , and the total mass @xmath26 ; the quantity @xmath27 is the normal density of nuclear matter .",
    "the momentum dependence is contained in the @xmath28 terms , which indicate integrals of the form :    @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "this choice of the function @xmath31 corresponds to a skyrme - like behaviour and it is suitable for @xmath17 simulations .",
    "we use a soft equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter ( compressibility modulus @xmath32 ) . in this frame",
    "we can easily adjust the parameters in order to have the same density dependence of the symmetry energy _ but with two opposite n / p effective mass splittings _ , as predicted by the early skyrme forces @xcite and the later skyrme - lyon parametrizations @xcite .",
    "so we can separately study the corresponding dynamical effects , @xcite .    a good way to visualize the physical meaning of the mass splitting",
    "is to look at the kinetic energy dependence of the lane potential @xmath33 , @xcite .",
    "its slope depends on the value and sign of the mass splitting ( see @xcite for details ) . in fig .",
    "[ lanepseudo ] we plot the lane potential with the parameters corresponding to the two choices of the sign of the n / p mass splitting ( shown in the insert for the @xmath34 asymmetry ) . in the two cases ,",
    "the absolute value of the splitting is exactly the same ( the difference between neutron and proton masses is @xmath35 at normal density ) , only the sign is opposite .",
    "the upper curve well reproduces the skyrme - lyon ( in particular @xmath36 ) results , the lower ( dashed ) the @xmath37 ones .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( 110.5,25 )     asymmetry ) . _",
    "_ ]    from the figure we can immediately derive the expectation of very different symmetry effects for nucleons around @xmath38 kinetic energy : enhancement ( with larger neutron repulsion ) in the @xmath39 case vs. a disappearing ( and even larger proton repulsion ) in the @xmath40 choice . besides , we can see a crossing of the two prescriptions at low energy : this means that low momentum nucleons feel almost the same lane potential .",
    "thus it is important to choose the appropriate dynamical observables in order to clearly see the effect of mass splitting , e.g. to look at observables where neutron / proton mean fields at high momentum are playing an important role .",
    "we have performed realistic `` ab initio '' simulations of collisions at intermediate energies of n - rich systems , in particular @xmath41 at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , at impact parameter @xmath44 .",
    "we have employed either an @xmath45 or an @xmath46 density dependence of the symmetry energy , corresponding to different slopes around normal density , with an increasing symmetry repulsion in the @xmath45 case , @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of our work is also to select reaction observables more sensitive to the momentum ( non - local part ) than to the density ( local part ) dependence of the symmetry term .    performing a local low density selection of the test particles ( @xmath47 )",
    "we can follow the time evolution of nucleon emissions ( gas phase ) and the corresponding asymmetry .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ asyevol ] ( where @xmath48 ) for the @xmath49 reaction .",
    "the solid line gives the initial asymmetry of the total system .     at @xmath50 for two opposite choices of mass splitting .",
    "left panel : asy - soft eos ; right panel : asy - stiff eos . _",
    "_ ]    a general feature of nucleon emission is the isospin distillation ( see @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) , which leads to a gas phase with an asymmetry greater than the initial one .",
    "we find an interesting behaviour for the isospin content of the nucleonic gas : at early times ( up to about 60 fm / c ) , during the ( high density ) compression phase , the asy - stiff choice leads to higher isospin asymmetry than the asy - soft one ; later , we can see an inversion of this trend , due to large contributions to the gas phase coming from low density regions @xcite ; finally , the gas phase is more asymmetric in the asy - soft case @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is mainly due to the local part of the symmetry energy , but for both choices of the density stiffness of the symmetry term we clearly see also the effects of the mass splitting , resulting in a reduced fast neutron emission when @xmath40 .",
    "it is more pronounced during the early stages of the reaction ( up to @xmath51 ) , when the most energetic particles are emitted @xcite and the momentum dependent part of the mean field is more effective .",
    "the two effects we have just discussed , the former related to the density dependence , the latter to the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential , can be singled out in the transverse momentum distribution of the n / z content of the gas phase .    in order to better isolate the mass splitting effect and to select the corresponding observables , in figs .",
    "[ sn132_50 ] ,  [ sn132_50_split ] we report the @xmath1 of the `` gas '' at two different times , @xmath52 ( end of the pre - equilibrium emission ) , and @xmath53 ( roughly freeze - out time ) .",
    "we have followed the transverse momentum dependence , for a fixed central rapidity @xmath54 ( normalized to projectile rapidity ) .",
    "[ sn132_50 ] we show the results _ without the mass splitting effect _ , i.e. only taking into account the different repulsion of the symmetry term ( the initial average asymmetry is @xmath55 ) .     for a central reaction @xmath41 at @xmath50 .",

    "[ sn132_50 ] ) , when the emission from high density regions is dominant , we see a difference due to the larger neutron repulsion of the asy - stiff choice . the effect is reduced at higher @xmath56 s due to the overall repulsion of the isoscalar momentum dependence . finally at freeze out",
    "( right panel ) the difference is less pronounced , since @xmath57 is coming into play during the expansion phase ; it is more efficient in the asy - soft choice , @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "when we introduce the mass splitting , the difference in the isotopic content of the gas , for the larger transverse momenta , is very evident at all times , in particular at the freeze - out of experimental interest , see fig .",
    "[ sn132_50_split ] .",
    "as expected the @xmath40 sharply reduces the neutron emission at high @xmath56 s .",

    "we note a decreasing behaviour of the n / z content of pre - equilibrium emission versus the transverse momentum , due to a larger neutron attraction , in the @xmath59 case , while in the opposite case we get a flat , or even increasing , trend .    , but for an incident energy of @xmath43 ( note the reduced `` pre - equilibrium '' , left panel , and `` freeze - out '' , right panel , times ) . _ _ ]    the n / z of emitted particles has been studied also as a function of rapidity ( see fig.[new ] ) .",
    "it is possible to see that , at @xmath60 ( end of the pre - equilibrium emission at this beam energy ) , differences between the two prescriptions are present at all rapidities , though more pronounced for faster particles , as expected .",
