    "during the recent years , numerous works have been devoted to the study of interfacial effects in ferroelectric nanostructures.@xcite both theoretical and experimental works have focused on different types of ferroelectric multilayers and superlattices including ( i ) ferroelectric ultrathin films between metalic electrodes ( fe / me interface),@xcite ( ii ) superlattices combining two ferroelectric materials ( fe / fe interface),@xcite and ( iii ) superlattices in which a ferroelectric alternates with an incipient ferroelectric ( fe / ife interface).@xcite these studies highlighted the fact that three main factors govern the physics of multilayers : epitaxial strain , electrical boundary conditions and interfacial effects .    the case of ferroelectric / insulator superlattices ( fe / i interface ) in which a ferroelectric alternates with a regular insulator was only marginally addressed in the literature .",
    "this might be due to the fact that no enhancement of the ferroelectric properties is expected in such systems due to the detrimental effect of the regular insulator on the ferroelectric properties .",
    "for some time , only the interface between ao and abo@xmath6 oxides , where a is an alkaline - earth atom such as sr or ba , attracted some interest since ao oxides are playing a key role as buffer layer in the epitaxial growth of perovskites directly on a silicon substrate.@xcite a first - principles study was previously reported by some of us for ( batio@xmath6)@xmath1/(bao)@xmath2 and ( srtio@xmath6)@xmath1/(sro)@xmath2 superlattices grown on si,@xcite but only the paraelectric periodicity @xmath7=6 and @xmath5=5 was considered and the ferroelectric properties were not explicitly discussed .",
    "nevertheless the focus on these particular fe / i interfaces has lately increased .",
    "the ruddlesden - poper series can be considered as an example of this type.@xcite this renewed interest is fueled by the possibility of modifying in a controlled way the delicate balance between all the instabilities present at the bulk abo@xmath8 perovskites , that might be ferroelectric ( fe ) , antiferroelectric ( afe ) , and/or antiferrodistortive ( afd ) phase transitions by changing the composition and/or periodicity of the series .",
    "the perspectives of stabilizing new exotic phases not present at the bulk parent compounds is a strong driving force for these studies.@xcite    in this paper , we study the case of ( batio@xmath6)@xmath1/(bao)@xmath2 superlattices epitaxially grown on a srtio@xmath6 substrate as a prototypical example of fe / i superlattices .",
    "we first consider the predictions of a simple electrostatic model as reported in ref .  .",
    "then , we present first - principles calculations of the phonon band structure of the paraelectric ( batio@xmath6)@xmath1/(bao)@xmath2 superlattices for various layer thicknesses @xmath5 and @xmath7 , and discuss the effects of the periodicity on the vibrational properties . we show that the predicted ground state differs from that of the simple electrostatic model , and explain the reason for the discrepancy .",
    "first - principles simulations were performed in the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the abinit package.@xcite all the results were calculated through the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "an energy cut - off of 45 ha was used for the planewave expansion .",
    "the teter parametrization  @xcite for pseudopotentials was employed where the following orbitals were treated as valence states : 5@xmath9 , 5@xmath10 and 6@xmath9 for the ba atom , 3@xmath9 , 3@xmath10 , 3@xmath11 and 4@xmath9 for the ti atom and 2@xmath9 and 2@xmath10 for the o atom . from the smallest to the biggest superlattices , tetragonal monkhorst - pack meshes from respectively @xmath12 to @xmath13 were considered for the brillouin zone sampling in order to produce accurate results .",
    "the vibrational properties and born effective charges were calculated using the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt).@xcite    batio@xmath6 can be epitaxially grown on bao.@xcite the epitaxy is such that abo@xmath6(001)@xmath14ao(001 ) and abo@xmath15110@xmath16ao@xmath17100@xmath18 , which means that the batio@xmath6 unit cell is rotated @xmath19 around the ( 001 ) bao direction .",
    "the superlattices were simulated by means of a supercell approximation with periodic boundary conditions , so short - circuit electrostatic boundary conditions across the whole supercell are naturally impossed .",
    "to define the cell that is periodically repeated in space , a generic formula ( bao - tio@xmath20)@xmath1/(bao)@xmath2 was used and labeled by @xmath3 , where @xmath7 is the number of bao oxide atomic layer and @xmath5 the number of batio@xmath6 formula units.@xcite    the epitaxial strain was treated by fixing the cubic in - plane lattice constant of the superlattices .",
    "only the case of an epitaxial strain corresponding to an hypothetical srtio@xmath6 substrate was considered ( theoretical lda relaxed cubic cell parameter of srtio@xmath6 : @xmath21 = 3.84  ) . for each thickness , we performed structural optimization of the atomic positions and the out - of - plane cell parameter of the superlattice in its highly symmetric phase corresponding to the tetragonal space group _ p4/mmm _ ( no 123 ) .    to establish the notation",
    ", we will call the plane parallel to the interface the ( @xmath22 ) plane , whereas the perpendicular direction will be referred to as the @xmath23 axis .",
    "as explained in ref .  , the energy of a ferroelectric superlattice between materials 1 and 2 under short - circuit boundary conditions can be estimated within a simple model which assumes homogeneous polarization in each layer and neglect interface corrections , as the sum of the internal energy for the two compounds forming the superlattice and an electrostatic correction ,    @xmath24    in first approximation , the internal energies @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be determined at the bulk level in the absence of a macroscopic electric field , while the term @xmath27 takes into account the electrostatic energy cost related to the polarization mismatch between the two types of layers . from now on",
    ", we will assume that material 1 is batio@xmath8 ( bto ) and material 2 is bao ( bo ) .      in their relaxed cubic structures",
    ", we obtained the lattice constants @xmath28=5.46   and @xmath29=3.94    for bao and batio@xmath6 respectively , which are in good agreement with previous lda results.@xcite in the nacl structure , a cell parameter of 5.46   in the bao bulk corresponds to a ba - ba distance of 3.86  .",
    "therefore , when grown on a srtio@xmath6 substrate , assuming a theoretical cubic in - plane lattice constant of 3.84  , batio@xmath6 is under compressive strain and becomes tetragonal , as well as bao ( the epitaxial strain being applied on the ba - ba distance ) in a smaller extent.@xcite after relaxation with this epitaxial constraint , the out - of - plane cell parameters of the paraelectric references are @xmath30=5.48   and @xmath31=4.01    for bao and batio@xmath6 respectively ( where the superscript `` 0 '' refers to the fact that it is the @xmath32-parameter at zero polarization ) .",
    "the associated born effective charge and electronic dielectric tensors are reported in table  [ zepsbulk ] .",
    "these values are comparable to those in the cubic structure , with a small anisotropy due to the tetragonal symmetry : most components of the born effective charges and electronic dielectric tensors are smaller in the @xmath23 than in the @xmath33 directions . the frequency of the lowest transverse optic ( to ) mode are also reported in table  [ zepsbulk ] together with their mode effective charges . in this constrained paraelectric configuration ,",
    "bao is stable but the mode polarized along the @xmath23 direction has a slightly lower frequency than those along the @xmath33 directions.@xcite batio@xmath6 shows a ferroelectric instability along the @xmath23 direction with an imaginary frequency of 180i @xmath34 and an associated mode effective charge of 8.47 e while in the @xmath33 directions , the frequency of the soft mode is shifted to real frequency ( 195 @xmath34 ) and its mode effective charge is slightly reduced ( 8.00 e ) .    .",

    "[ soverv](a ) the dependence with respect the number of batio@xmath8 unit cells of the ratio between the oscillator strength and the volume of the unit cell ( s/@xmath45 ) for _ _ n__=2 and _ _ n__=4 .",
    "the oscillator strength of one mode is defined as  @xcite    @xmath46    where @xmath47 are the individual atomic born effective charge tensors and @xmath48 is the phonon eigendisplacement vector .",
    "this s/@xmath45 ratio increases strongly with @xmath5 , evolving rapidly from values smaller than in bulk bao at @xmath5=2 to larger values . at the considered thicknesses ,",
    "s/@xmath45 is much smaller than for bulk batio@xmath6 but we can expect that it will reach the batio@xmath6 bulk value at large enough @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear here that the modification of the s/@xmath45 ratio comes either from a modification of the born effective charge and/or from a modification of the eigenvector @xmath48 .",
    "as shown in table  [ becsuperlat ] , the born effective charges only tends to increase smoothly with @xmath5 and can not be responsible to the strong modification of s/@xmath45 shown in fig .",
    "[ soverv](a ) .    in fig .",
    "[ soverv](b ) we report the evolution of the square of the norm of the phonon eigendisplacement vector @xmath49 with respect to @xmath5 . here ,",
    "@xmath49 increases strongly with @xmath5 , which can be related to a strong enhancement of the ferroelectric eigenvector @xmath48 with the batio@xmath8 thickness .",
    "therefore , according to eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) , the evolution of the s/@xmath45 ratio can be mainly attributed to the modification of the ferroelectric eigenvector when @xmath5 is modified .",

    "m_. the horizontal dashed lines correspond to the batio@xmath6 and bao bulk limit s/@xmath45 values which are respectively equal to 43 10@xmath51 and 5 10@xmath51 a.u.,width=283,height=321 ]    in summary , this analysis points out that the simple electrostatic model based on the bulk quantities can fail to reproduce the first - principles results because of a strong modification of the ferroelectric eigenvector in the superlattice for the smallest periodicities .",
    "this ferroelectric mode is strongly sensitive to the thickness of the batio@xmath6 layer in the superlattice and , surprisingly does not reach the batio@xmath6 bulk ferroelectric soft mode , even for the largest @xmath3 considered .",
    "compared to other previously studied superlattices like srtio@xmath6/batio@xmath6,the modification of the soft - mode pattern could be amplified here due to the fact that the batio@xmath6 and the bao layer are not sharing the same perovskite structure .",
    "this teaches us that the quantitative agreement of the model for @xmath52 could be at least partly fortuitous and that model prediction have to be considered with caution .",
    "the phonon dispersion curves between @xmath53 ( 0,0,0 ) , x ( @xmath54,0,0 ) and m ( @xmath54,@xmath54,0 ) points were also calculated , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ disp ] for periodicities 2/2 , 4/2 and 6/2 . at the smallest thickness ( 2/2 )",
    ", no instability is present , neither at @xmath53 , x nor m point .",
    "this confirms that the ground state of the 2/2 multilayer is the non - polar _ p4/mmm _ phase .",
    "however , for the 4/2 periodicity an instability appears at the x zone - boundary point with a frequency of 42i @xmath34 , and its magnitude is amplified for larger @xmath5 , with a calculated frequency of 92i @xmath34 for 6/2 .",
    "moreover , in fig .",
    "[ disp](b ) a low frequency mode is also observed at the m zone boundary point for the 4/2 thickness .",
    "this mode becomes unstable for the 6/2 periodicity , but with an amplitude smaller than the instability at the x point .",
    "the branch responsible for the m point instability is the same than the one responsible for x point instability and its dispersion is flat between the x and m points while it shifts rapidly to a positive frequency when going from x or m point to the @xmath53 point .",
    "similar behaviors are also observed for the @xmath5/4 periodicities .",
    "an x point instability is also observed for @xmath554 and its amplitude is also amplified with _ m _ , with esentially the same imaginary frequencies as in the @xmath7 = 2 case ( 42i @xmath34 for 4/4 and 91i @xmath34 for 6/4 ) . in conclusion , for both thicknesses of the bao layer , zone boundary instabilities appear before the zone center ferroelectric becomes soft .    _ _ = 2/2 ( a ) , 4/2 ( b ) , and 6/2 ( c ) .",
    "the color of the different branches are assigned according to the contribution of each chemical species to the dynamical matrix eigenvector ( red for the ba atom , green for the ti atom , and blue for the o atom).,width=283 ]    to clarify the atomic motions related to the x point instability , we display a schematic picture of the eigendisplacement pattern in fig .",
    "[ afeigen ] for the 6/4 periodicity .",
    "since the instability is located at the x point , atoms in consecutive cells along the [ 100 ] direction move out - of - phase . as we can see on fig .",
    "[ afeigen ] , these eigendisplacements can be decomposed into two components : ( i ) polar distortions along the _ z _ direction , only for the atoms along the ti  o chains , and ( ii ) in - plane motions , only for ba and o atoms which are along the ba  o chains parallel to the ti  o chains .",
    "the amplitudes of these in - plane displacements are however much smaller than the out - of - plane displacements , meaning that the ti  o distortions along the @xmath23 direction dominate the total motions ( blue - green color of the unstable branch at the x point in fig .  [ disp ] ) . moreover , on the two bao atomic planes corresponding to the two mirror planes of symmetry in the @xmath23 direction , the in -",
    "plane motions completely disappear .",
    "additionally , we can notice that the polar distortions along the @xmath23 direction remain in the bao layer but only for the atoms aligned with the ti  o chain , in order to preserve the flow of large polarization currents along those chains .",
    "since in consecutive unit cells along the [ 100 ] direction the polar displacements are in opposite directions , these x point instabilities are related to an _ antiferroelectric _ distortion . to highlight these issues ,",
    "we report also in fig .",
    "[ afeigen](b ) schematic vectors showing the direction of main local dipolar moments . from this picture",
    ", it is clear that along the @xmath23 directions we have antiferroelectric distortions , with alternating chains of up and down polarization . for the in - plane ba and o motions ,",
    "the atoms move only in the [ 100 ] direction , giving rise to dipolar moments oriented along the @xmath42 direction . between the two mirror symmetry planes , these in - plane dipolar moments keep the same orientation , but it is inverted after crossing these symmetry planes . interestingly , this inversion does not take place at the interface of the supercell but in the middle of each layer .     direction are shown .",
    "atoms are represented by balls ( o in red , ti in green and ba in blue ) .",

    "the thickness evolution of the phonon dispersion curves of the batio@xmath6/bao superlattice , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phonondisp ] , can be understood in relationship with those of bulk batio@xmath6 . at the bulk level",
    ", batio@xmath6 was shown to exhibit a _ chain - like _ ferroelectric instability in real space , with weak inter - chain interactions , yielding ferroelectric modes similarly unstable at @xmath53 , x and m points.@xcite the ferroelectric mode at @xmath53 is highly polar . in the superlattice , due to the difficulty to polarize bao",
    ", it will be associated to a huge depolarizing field which will strongly harden it . at the opposite ,",
    "the zone - boundary ferroelectric modes at x and m , are globally non - polar .",
    "they will therefore not induce any macroscopic depolarizing field and will so keep a much stronger tendency to be unstable than the @xmath53 mode .",
    "consequently , the zone - boundary modes will always be more unstable than the @xmath53 mode in the superlattice , yielding an anti - ferroelectric ground - state .",
    "it is only in the limit of thick batio@xmath6 layers , for which the depolarizing field tends to vanish , that we will recover the usual ferroelectric ground - state .",
    "it is also worth to notice that , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the instability at x similarly appears at @xmath4 , which corresponds to what was previously reported as the approximative length of the correlation volume ( @xmath58 ) required to induce a ferroelectric instability .",
    "@xcite    the evolution of the ground state of the superlattice with the ticknesses of the layers can therefore be summarized as follows : ( i ) for the smallest batio@xmath6 thicknesses _ @xmath59 _ , the system does not exhibit any ferroelectric instability and the supercell remains paraelectric .",
    "( ii ) for larger batio@xmath6 thicknesses ( _ @xmath60 _ ) but small ratio _",
    "@xmath3 _ , the ferroelectric instability at @xmath53 is suppressed by the effect of the depolarizing field ; there is only an instability at x and the system is antiferroelectric .",
    "( iii ) as the ratio _",
    "increases , the ferroelectricity will progressively expand from x to @xmath53 and we can expect the formation of ferroelectric domains of increasing sizes .",
    "( iv ) only when @xmath61 , the superlattice will tend to the purely ferroelectric ground - state .",
    "we notice that the present batio@xmath6/bao superlattices present similarities with ruddlesden - popper @xmath62 materials which can be viewed as the stacking of alternating perovskite and rocksalt layers.@xcite in the latter , however , there is no continuity of the ti  o chains from one perovskite block to the next one .",
    "this will prevent the possibility of huge polarization currents along the stacking direction as those associated to the feroelectric mode in batio@xmath6/bao system and could explain why ruddlesden - popper materials do not develop any tendency to become ferroelectric with polarization aligned along the stacking direction.@xcite",
    "in this paper we have studied , from first - principles , superlattices combining @xmath5 unit cells of batio@xmath6 with @xmath7 unit cells of bao . although batio@xmath6 is ferroelectric at the bulk level , we have shown that the superlattice can present an antiferroelectric ground - state and explained that by the hardening of the ferroelectric mode with respect to the antiferroelectric mode due to depolarizing field issues .",
    "this behavior is quite general .",
    "while epitaxial strain was already previously reported to be able to modify the competition between ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities , we propose that playing with the depolarizing field in ferroelectric / insulator superlattices is another practical way to tune the competition between polar and non - polar instabilites .",
    "we have demonstrated here the possibility to engineer an antiferroelectric ground - state in a system combining ferroelectric and antiferroelectric instabilities .",
    "we anticipate that in systems with competing ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities , it could similarly favor an antiferrodistortive ground - state .",
    "we hope that these results will motivate further studies of feroelectric / insulator superlattices ..",
