    "we use the observations of monitor of all sky x - ray image ( maxi ) @xcite .",
    "maxi was launched in 2009 july and attached to the international space station ( iss ) .",
    "the iss with maxi orbits the earth in 92 minutes , and maxi scans the objects in the all sky once in an orbit .",
    "maxi has already reported more than one hundred transients .",
    "the observed results are immediately released through the internet , promoting rapid follow - up observations with telescopes around the world .",
    "maxi has two kinds of x - ray cameras : the gas slit camera ( gsc : @xcite ) covering the energy band of 220 kev . and the solid - state slit camera ( ssc : @xcite ) covering 0.77 kev .",
    "we can downloaded one - day bin and 90 min bin archival data for making light curves from the maxi home page .",
    "the energy spectra , images and also light curves of both the gsc and the ssc can be processed by the maxi on - demand data web page @xcite .",
    "maxi is monitoring 21 bl lacs and 3 quasars .",
    "we show the light curves for 5 years by maxi / gsc of mrk 421 , mrk 501 and 3c 273 in figure [ mrk421 ] .",
    "we reported their x - ray flares and brightenings to the astronomer s telegram ( atel , showed as grey lines in figure [ mrk421 ] ) .",
    "at 05:31:55 ut on march 2 , 2014 , maxi nova alert system detected a new faint x ",
    "ray source which was @xmath010 mcrab in figure [ 1930 ] .",
    "we named it maxi j1930 + 093 and reported to the atel@xmath15943 @xcite .",
    "after that , swift / xrt observed the error region of maxi .",
    "swift found an x - ray source which was the same intensity as maxi observation , and identified it to the bl lac object 2fgl j1931.1 + 0938 .      at 19:24:10 ut on march 24 , 2014 , maxi nova alert system detected transient object which was 6.6 mcrab in figure [ bzb ] .",
    "it had been identified as 2maxi j0243582 in the maxi / gsc 37-month catalog @xcite .",
    "we proposed a swift too observation with 4-point tiling to cover the maxi error circle with the swift xrt . in the swift xrt image",
    ", we find a bright point source at ( ra , dec)= ( 2h 44 m 40.10s , @xmath258d 19 m 54.8s ) with an estimated error of 2.3 arcseconds radius ( 90@xmath3 c.l . ) .",
    "this position lies 1.54 arc - seconds from the ned position of the bl lac object bzb j02445819 .",
    "we therefore suggest that the trigger source is an x - ray flare of bzb j02445819 ( = maxi j0243582 ) ( atel@xmath16012 @xcite ) .",
    "cygnus x-1 ( cyg x1 ) is one of the most famous high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , and is composed of a black hole ( bh ) and a massive giant companion star .",
    "x  ray from cyg x1 is highly variable , the binary period is 5.6 d , and the distance is 1.86@xmath4 kpc @xcite .",
    "the galactic bh binaries have two spectral states , a low / hard state that is dominated by a power - law spectrum , corresponding to the radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) , and a high / soft state that is dominated by a thermal emission from the standard optically thick accretion disk @xcite .",
    "maxi obtained a long - term light curve for more than 5 years of cyg x1 @xcite .",
    "cyg x1 had been in the low / hard state until june 2010 , and after that it stayed in the high / soft state for about ten months @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : cyglc ] shows light curves with one - day bin of cyg x1 obtained with gsc from 15 august 2009 ( 55058 mjd ) to 9 november 2014 ( 56970 mjd ) , in three energy bands ( 24 kev , 410 kev and 1020 kev ) .",
    "the two kinds of hardness ratios , @xmath5(410 kev)/@xmath5(24 kev ) and @xmath5(1020 kev)/@xmath5(410 kev ) , are also plotted .",
    "the state of cyg x1 can be recognized by the values of the hardness ratios .",
    "the low / hard state continued for about ten months since the start of the maxi observation .",
    "a transition to the high / soft state occurred around 55378 mjd and then continued for another ten - month .",
    "after several state transitions , it has stayed in the high / soft state since 56107 mjd .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : cyghdi ] shows a hardness - intensity diagram .",
    "the vertical axis shows count rates in the 210 kev band , and the horizontal axis indicates the hardness ratios of the count rates in the 410 kev band to those in the 24 kev band .",
    "the lower panel in figure [ fig : cyghdi ] shows a histogram of the number of data points in certain bins of the hardness ratio .",
    "we can see clear two peaks , which correspond to the high / soft state and the low / hard state . to separate the period into those two states",
    ", we fit the histogram with two gaussian functions , and determined the mean values and standard deviations of the gaussian functions .",
    "then we defined the state of each data point , by checking whether the hardness ratio of the data point is in @xmath6 3@xmath7 of the distributions .",
    "blue and red data points in figure [ fig : cyghdi ] are thus defined the low / hard state and the high / soft state , respectively .",
    "black points are between then and considered as the transition .",
    "the determined terms of the states are summarized in table [ tb : trans ] .",
