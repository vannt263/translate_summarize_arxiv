    "( sub-)millimeter interferometry offers great opportunities to study massive star - forming regions in detail .",
    "high - mass star formation proceeds in a clustered mode , and at the typical distances of a few kpc high angular resolution is necessary to resolve the different phenomena taking place .",
    "furthermore , massive star - forming cores emit strongly in the ( sub-)mm regime and exhibit a forest of molecular line transitions tracing various physical aspects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here , we present early results obtained in the field of massive star formation with the submillimeter array ( sma ) on mauna kea / hawaii . before the advent of the sma ,",
    "the only sub - mm interferometry ever conducted was single - baseline work with the jcmt and cso , which aimed largely at low - mass sources because the expected structures would be simple ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the target source iras18089 - 1732 is part of a sample of 69 high - mass protostellar objects selected mainly via infrared color - color criteria and the absence of strong cm continuum emission @xcite .",
    "it is approximately at a distance of 3.6kpc and its bolometric luminosity is about @xmath1l@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "previous millimeter continuum observations reveal a massive core @xmath3m@xmath2 with h@xmath4o and ch@xmath5oh maser emission , and a weak 1mjy cm source is detected @xcite . as part of a single - dish co outflow study , wing emission indicative of molecular outflows was detected @xcite , and @xcite report the detection of the hot - core molecules ch@xmath5cn and ch@xmath5oh .",
    "comprising all features of a young luminous massive star - forming region at an early evolutionary stage just beginning to form a hot core , iras18089 - 1732 is an ideal target for early science with the sma .",
    "while this letter focuses on the multi - line observations of iras18089 - 1732 , an accompanying letter discusses the ( sub-)mm continuum and sio / hcooch@xmath5 line data revealing the disk - jet system ( beuther et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "iras18089 - 1732 was observed with the sma between may and july 2003 in two different configurations with 3 to 5 antennas in the array .",
    "the phase reference center of the observations was r.a.[j2000 ] 18:11:51.4 and dec.[j2000 ] @xmath6:31:28.5 .",
    "the projected baselines ranged from 10.8/18.6 to 120 m for the 1.3mm/850@xmath0 m observations , respectively .",
    "for bandpass calibration we used the planet mars .",
    "the flux density scale was derived by observations of the planet uranus and is estimated to be accurate within 25@xmath7 .",
    "phase and amplitude calibration was done via frequent observations of the quasar nrao530 , approximately @xmath8 from the target source ( @xmath9jy and @xmath10jy ) .",
    "the zenith opacity for the 350ghz observations   measured at 225ghz with the nrao tipping radiometer operated by the cso ( @xmath11 )   was excellent for one track ( @xmath12(354ghz)@xmath13 ) but somewhat worse for the second track ( @xmath12(354ghz)@xmath14 ) .",
    "the data of the second track could only be used for the 850@xmath0 m continuum because the signal - to - noise ratio in the line data was too low . for the 217ghz observations the opacity was slightly higher with @xmath12(225ghz)@xmath15 in one night and @xmath12(225ghz)@xmath16 in the other night . the doppler - tracking center frequency on the source",
    "was @xmath17kms@xmath18 .",
    "the receivers operate in a double - sideband mode ( dsb ) with an if band of 46ghz .",
    "the correlator bandwidth at the time of observation was 1ghz , and the frequency resolution was 0.825mhz .",
    "in the 850@xmath0 m band we tuned the receivers to the hcn(43 ) line at 354.5055ghz in the upper sideband . at 1 mm the tuning",
    "was centered on the sio(54 ) line at 217.1049ghz in the lower sideband . because of double - sideband reception we obtained simultaneously data at 344ghz and 227ghz .",
    "the beam sizes of the combined datasets at 1.3 mm was @xmath19 and at 850@xmath0 m @xmath20 ( uniform weighting ) , the beam size of the 850@xmath0 m line data using only one track was @xmath21 .",
    "system temperatures ( dsb ) in the 850@xmath0 m band were between 300 - 900k and in the 1 mm band around 200k .",
    "the primary beam at 217ghz was @xmath22 and at 354ghz @xmath23 .",
    "the continuum rms was @xmath24mjy at 217ghz and @xmath25mjy at 345ghz .",
    "the calibration was done with the idl superset mir developed originally for ovro and adapted for the sma .",
    "the imaging was performed in miriad .",
    "figure [ spectra ] presents two spectra taken at 217ghz and 344ghz ( both on baselines of @xmath26 m ) , showing an impressive line forest of various molecular lines . in the whole dataset with a total bandwidth of 4ghz ( 1ghz in a dsb mode per frequency setup )",
    "we detect 34 molecular lines from 16 molecules / isotopomers , with 5 lines remaining unidentified ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "we detected lines from molecular species tracing various physical and chemical processes within massive star - forming regions .",
    "while silicon and sulphur bearing molecules are known to be strong in shocked regions and thus often trace molecular outflows , we also detected typical hot core molecules like ch@xmath5och@xmath5 , ch@xmath5oh , and numerous hcooch@xmath5 lines .",
    "the data are rich in nitrogen bearing species as hcn , hc@xmath5n , and hc@xmath27n , which are subject to a different chemistry than , e.g. , oxygen bearing species ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we observed the deuterated species dcn which again is subject to different chemical networks ( e.g. , @xcite ) . it should be noted that the setup was chosen originally for sio(54 ) and hcn(43 ) , the other line detections were achieved because of the broad bandwidth",
    ". transitions of other typical molecules like ch@xmath5cn or cn were absent in this specific setup .",
    "the data suggest that because of the richness of lines in the ( sub-)millimeter window , the sma will almost always be able to sample many transitions simultaneously .",
    "figure 1 also shows the different continuum levels at 1 mm and 850@xmath0 m of which a detailed analysis is presented in the accompanying letter ( beuther et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "we estimate the line contamination to the broadband continuum flux in the 1.3 mm band and the 850@xmath0 m band both to be about 10% .    comparing the line forest with orion - kl , the proto - typical high - mass star - forming region toward which many line surveys have been conducted ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we detect in the same frequency ranges all lines previously observed toward orion - kl , but with on average significantly narrower line width toward iras18089 - 1732 : e.g. , toward orion - kl in the 344ghz band the hc@xmath27n and ch@xmath5och@xmath5 blend into the broad line wings of the so line @xcite whereas they are clearly resolved from each other in the iras18089 - 1732 data ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "the two main reasons likely contributing to this difference are the larger luminosity of orion ( 10@xmath28l@xmath2 compared to 10@xmath29l@xmath2 ) and the earlier evolutionary stage of iras18089 - 1732 which is just at the verge of forming a hypercompact hii region @xcite .",
    "the large number of observed hcooch@xmath5 lines allows us to estimate a temperature for the central region @xcite . as the data quality is not good enough to image all lines properly , especially in the 850@xmath0 m band ( see  [ imaging ] ) , we fitted the intensities in the visibility domain . from a boltzmann plot",
    "we derive a rotation temperature of @xmath30k .",
    "as hcooch@xmath5 traces the dense gas at the core center , this rather high temperature indicates the existence of a hot molecular core in the near vicinity of the central hypercompact hii region @xcite .",
    "such high temperatures at the core center are further supported by recent vla detections of the nh@xmath5(6,6 ) line with an energy level of 412k .",
    "many of the presented molecular lines are strong enough to image , which is an enormous step forward compared to single - dish line surveys .",
    "single - dish observations rarely have sufficient angular resolution to resolve the sources , although massive star - forming regions are usually so complex that the chemistry , density and temperatures exhibit detailed spatial structures .",
    "simultaneous interferometric imaging of various molecular lines is thus the best tool to investigate these characteristics in more detail ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because we have only one track at 850@xmath0 m with good enough signal - to - noise ratio to use for the line imaging , we are restricted in this band to the two strongest lines : hcn and so ( figure [ images ] ) . in the 1 mm band",
    "we could image many more lines .",
    "figure [ images ] presents a characteristic subset of the integrated emission maps , consisting of the outflow tracer sio , the hot - core tracer hcooch@xmath5 , the molecule ch@xmath5oh , the sulphur bearing molecule h@xmath4s , the deuterated molecule dcn and the nitrogen bearing molecule hc@xmath5n .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] presents the peak and integrated fluxes @xmath31 & @xmath32 .",
    "individual characteristics of the different species are discussed below . in the accompanying paper ( beuther et al .",
    ", this volume ) , we discuss the sio(54 ) and hcooch@xmath5(2019 ) line observations of this dataset in detail . here",
    "we present only the integrated sio and hcooch@xmath5 emission to outline their outflow / core properties and to associate the emission of the other molecules with the different physical components within the region .",
    "as shown in fig . [ images ] and outlined in beuther et al .",
    "( this volume ) , the sio(54 ) data depict an outflow emanating from the central dust core in the northern direction .",
    "this outflow is approximately in the plane of the sky and the sio emission traces only the northern lobe .",
    "the hot core molecule hcooch@xmath5(2019 ) traces the central dust condensation with a velocity gradient across the core at a position angle of @xmath33 with respect to the outflow direction . that the hcooch@xmath5 velocity gradient is not exactly perpendicular to the outflow can be interpreted as a rotating gas and dust disk which is influenced by the outflow as well as possible infall .    to give a flavor of the velocity structures varying with molecular line , figure [ channel ]",
    "shows two examples of channel maps , with ch@xmath5oh tracing the core and h@xmath4s tracing the outflow .",
    "the line - width of the two molecules is not very different because the outflow is approximately in the plane of the sky .",
    "however , the spatial distribution varies significantly .",
    "the core - tracing ch@xmath5oh shows a similar east - west velocity shift as hcooch@xmath5 whereas the h@xmath4s emission extends to the north comparable to sio . as the line - widths of the various molecules are of the same order we base the following outflow / core associations mainly on morphological similarities .",
    "comparing the molecular line data shown in figure [ images ] with the results from the sio / hcooch@xmath5 observations , we find that many lines are influenced by the outflow .",
    "most prominently , this influence is observed in the sulphur bearing species h@xmath4s and so .",
    "however , we find extensions to the north also in dcn and hcn , and , although to a lesser degree , in hc@xmath5n .",
    "ch@xmath5oh appears to be least affected by the outflow .",
    "quantitatively speaking , we compare the source sizes within the @xmath34 levels of the peak emission and the ratio of integrated to peak flux presented in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "taking into account the higher angular resolution and the larger interferometric spatial filtering in the 850@xmath0 m band , hcooch@xmath5 , ch@xmath5oh and hc@xmath5n are rather compact whereas the other molecules are more extended .",
    "this is reflected in the lower integrated to peak flux ratios of the core - tracing molecules .",
    "these findings are less of a surprise for h@xmath4s and so , which are known to be released from dust grains in shock interactions with molecular jets and outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in contrast",
    ", species like hcn and hc@xmath5n were believed to be mainly hot core tracing molecules @xcite .",
    "especially , hcn was considered as a possible disk tracer in massive star formation , which is not the case in iras18089 - 1732 because the outflow significantly shapes the overall hcn emission .",
    "similarly , recent observations toward iras18566 + 0408 and iras20126 + 4104 reveal strong hcn emission toward its outflow ( zhang , priv .",
    "the 354ghz hcn(43 ) data need to be improved for a more detailed investigation of hcn outflow and core emission in iras18089 - 1732 . on first sight",
    ", one gets the impression that the dcn emission might be more extended than hcn , but this is mainly due to the different frequency bands and thus varying interferometric spatial filtering .",
    "we re - imaged the dcn data using a short baseline cutoff as given by the hcn observations ( @xmath35k@xmath36 ) , and we find that the spatial distribution of hcn and its deuterated species dcn is quite similar .",
    "the compact ch@xmath5oh emission exhibits an east - west velocity gradient similar to hcooch@xmath5(2019 ) .",
    "however , ch@xmath5oh has been observed to be associated with outflows in other sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , its emission is not always unambiguously confined to core emission and has to be treated with similar caution as hcn .",
    "the data shown in this letter outline the unique capacities of the sma in performing imaging spectral line surveys .",
    "the presented data were taken in summer time in a testing mode with the partially completed sma . therefore , using the full capabilities of the sma in the very near future ( e.g. , doubled bandwidth of 2ghz , 8 antennas within the array , 2 receivers simultaneously , see also ho et al .",
    ", this volume ) we will get a far better sensitivity and imaging quality for forthcoming physical and chemical studies of various astrophysical objects .",
