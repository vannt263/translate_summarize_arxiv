    "in a previous communication @xcite ( to be denoted as paper 1 ) we studied theoretically the process of electronic energy transfer ( eet ) on molecular aggregates . the aim was to demonstrate that the coherent transfer arising from an entangled aggregate wavefunction ( an exciton ) in the quantum case , in the approximation that there is no exchange of electrons between monomers , is reproduced by a classical model of the aggregate as an assembly of electrical dipoles .",
    "the quantum / classical equivalence is valid in what we called the `` realistic coupling approximation '' ( rca ) .",
    "this is a weak - coupling approximation in that the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction that effects the transfer is considered small compared to typical electronic excitation energies , so that the monomers largely retain their character upon excitation of the aggregate .",
    "practically this implies that the exciton bandwidth and the average spread of monomeric transition energies are both small compared to the mean electronic transition energy .",
    "happily these criteria do pertain in many dye aggregates and also in the photosynthetic unit , so that the rca is valid and one expects the classical model to give results in agreement with the quantum theory .",
    "as specific example , we considered first the transfer of energy along a chain of identical monomers where , in the approximation that only nearest - neighbors interact , an analytical solution for the transfer probability is possible .",
    "this solution predicts oscillatory monomer excitation probability in time and a constant velocity eet along the chain from an initially - excited monomer .",
    "the constant velocity and the oscillating nature of the transfer probability are signatures of fully - coherent propagation .",
    "significantly it was shown , by numerical solution of the full classical equations for the same coupling , that classical interacting dipoles lead to exactly the same coherent transfer as in the quantum case .",
    "as a second model we considered eet on the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) photosynthetic complex , where the local transition energies of bacteriochlorophyll molecules on different sites are unequal . here again , using realistic transition energies and coupling strengths , we were able to show the equivalence of classical and quantum dynamics in deciding the coherence of eet .",
    "the equivalence in this example is of particular significance since here the coherence of eet has been attributed @xcite as arising solely from the entanglement properties of the aggregate electronic wavefunction . hence , were this to be true , one would not expect such coherence to be present in the results of a purely classical treatment .    in the above examples only electronic degrees of freedom were considered , since the emphasis was on coherent eet and the electronic excitation is the seat of such coherence .",
    "nevertheless , particularly with reference to the fmo complex , in any real molecular aggregate the internal electronic degrees of freedom experience interaction with internal and external vibrational modes and electromagnetic interaction with the surrounding solvent . in absorption and emission of photons",
    "such interactions manifest themselves obviously in broadening and shifting of spectral bands . in eet",
    "there are more subtle manifestations in the de - phasing , de - cohering and sometimes dissipating effects on propagation of absorbed light energy . hence , to obtain a more realistic overall picture and",
    "to further test the classical model of eet we feel it essential to include the interactions with the surroundings .",
    "this enlargement of the theoretical model , to consider the molecular aggregate as an open quantum or classical system , is the subject of this paper .",
    "the development of the paper proceeds as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : qm ] we consider the quantum case of a molecular aggregate in which the coupling to the environment is represented by interaction of electronic degrees of freedom with external stochastic fluctuations .",
    "these lead to de - phasing and time - varying electronic transition energies . here",
    "we adopt the usual density matrix formulation leading to a lindblad - type master equation which is equivalent to that derived by haken , reineker and strobl @xcite arising from markovian environment fluctuations .",
    "this will be denoted as the hrs equation .",
    "this model ( and its variants ) has been used extensively to describe exciton transport in molecular crystals , molecular aggregates and photosynthetic complexes ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite )    in section [ sec : class_mech ] we apply the same physical assumptions to derive a _",
    "classical _ density matrix equation of a similar , but not exactly equivalent , form to the quantum equation . in an appendix ,",
    "the equivalence of the classical formulation in the rca to the quantum version is proved .",
    "the proof is most transparent using the stochastic schrdinger quantum equation ( which is equivalent to the hrs equation ) .    in section [ sec : rca_test ] the two cases already considered in paper 1 as bare electronic systems",
    "are re - calculated including the effects of environment coupling .",
    "the main effect of this coupling is to damp out oscillations in occupation probabilities and to slow the rate of eet . perhaps more importantly , by plotting density matrix elements we show that coherences between different sites are suppressed also . in the case of the fmo complex , our model can now be considered a realistic representation of the main features of eet and yet , significantly , the exact purely classical model including environmental effects again gives results hardly distinguishable from the fully quantum results , including the coherences between different sites .",
    "the excitonic part of the aggregate is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the sum of the hamiltonians of non - interacting monomers and @xmath2 is the total potential energy of the pairwise interactions between monomers . since we consider the propagation of a single electronic excitation along the aggregate , we expand the hamiltonian with respect to states @xmath3 in which monomer @xmath4 is electronically excited and all other monomers are in their ground state . in this basis one has @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the single - monomer transition energy and the full aggregate ground - state energy",
    "is set to zero .",
    "the matrix - element @xmath7 describes excitation transfer between site @xmath4 and @xmath8 .    in the following we are interested in the dynamics of the ( reduced ) density matrix @xmath9 of the electronic system when the electronic excitation interacts with an environment .",
    "we adopt a particular simple model where the dynamics of the density matrix @xmath9 is determined by a lindblad master equation of the form @xmath10_{nm}+\\mathcal{l}[\\rho]_{nm } .\\ ] ] where @xmath11_{nm}&=&- \\frac{i}{\\hbar } [ { \\boldsymbol{h}}_{\\rm ex},\\rho(t)]_{nm}\\\\ & = & -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}(\\epsilon_n-\\epsilon_m)\\rho_{nm } - \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\sum_{\\ell}(v_{n\\ell}\\rho_{\\ell m}- v_{\\ell m}\\rho_{n \\ell } )   \\label{eq : dot_rho_nm_detail}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the last line follows from .",

    "the extension to the general hrs master equation is straightforward .",
    "also generalizations of the hrs model , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be treated similarly . in the conclusion",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail .    in the following we will derive a classical equation which in rca is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dot_rho_nm ] ) . to this end",
    "we first note that the master equation ( [ eq : dot_rho_nm ] ) is equivalent ( following the treatment of hrs @xcite ) to a stochastic schrdinger equation @xmath15 with local markovian fluctuations of the site energies .",
    "these fluctuations can be merged together with the transition energy of the monomers to obtain a stochastic hamiltonian @xmath16 where the fluctuations in the transition energies @xmath17 have the properties of real gaussian markov processes fulfilling @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the averaging over many realizations of the stochastic processes .",
    "the master equation is then obtained by taking the time derivative of @xmath20 .",
    "we note that we have restricted ourselves to gaussian markov processes , since then one can derive a simple master equation .",
    "the arguments presented below on the validity of the rca approximation are applicable to more general stochastic processes which do not have to be gaussian ( as long as the second moment exists ) and can also be correlated in time ( non - markovian ) .",
    "the stochastic unravelling will be used in the next section to make the connection to the classical case .",
    "in particular we will take the frequency of the classical oscillators to obey the same statistical properties as the quantum transition energies .",
    "the resulting classical stochastic equation will then be used to construct a classical master equation.",
    "as in our previous publications @xcite in the classical case we consider that the coupled quantum transition dipoles are modelled by classical oscillators in the same geometry as the transition dipoles of the quantum mechanical model .",
    "the frequencies of the classical oscillators are associated with the quantum energies via @xmath21 .",
    "to arrive at a density matrix description corresponding to we make use of the stochastic representation introduced in the previous section .",
    "thus we assume that the frequency of the classical oscillators is a stochastic quantity with @xmath22 and the same statistical properties as given by and .",

    "note that here @xmath31 appears as coupling in the equation for the amplitudes .",

    "some care has to be taken due to the stochastic nature of @xmath23 .",

    "note that the first term of the oscillator frequency @xmath41 is the average frequency and does not depend on time .",
    "the effect of the stochastic fluctuations are contained in the factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we now derive the equation of motion for @xmath44 . to this end",
    "we consider the differential of @xmath45 here we have taken terms up to the first order in @xmath46 into account . since @xmath47 scales like @xmath48 in the first line we have included the @xmath49 .",

    "<S> e 83 , 051911 ] we have shown that the results of a quantum - mechanical calculation of electronic energy transfer ( eet ) over aggregates of coupled monomers can be described also by a model of interacting classical electric dipoles in a weak - coupling approximation , which we referred to as the realistic coupling approximation ( rca ) . </S>",
    "<S> the method was illustrated by eet on a simple linear chain of molecules and also by energy transfer on the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex relevant for photosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> the study was limited to electronic degrees of freedom since this is the origin of coherent eet in the quantum case . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , more realistic models of eet require the inclusion of the de - cohering effects of coupling to an environment , when the molecular aggregate becomes an open quantum system . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider the quantum description of eet on a linear chain and on the fmo complex , incorporating environment coupling and construct the classical version of the same systems in the density matrix formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the close agreement of the exact quantum and exact classical results in the rca is demonstrated and justified analytically . </S>",
    "<S> this lends further support to the conclusion that the coherence properties of eet in the fmo complex is evident at the classical level and should not be ascribed as solely due to quantum effects . </S>"
