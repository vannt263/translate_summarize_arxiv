    "superconducting charge - transfer salts of the molecule bedt - ttf have attracted considerable experimental and theoretical interest because of their complex pressure - temperature ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) phase diagrams , some of which are superficially similar to those of the `` high-@xmath15 '' cuprate superconductors  @xcite .",
    "for example , the superconducting phase in the @xmath16-(bedt - ttf)@xmath17 salts is in close proximity to an antiferromagnetic insulator  @xcite and/or mott insulator  @xcite ; it is also surrounded by other unusual states  @xcite , including what has been termed a `` bad metal ''  @xcite .",
    "recent magnetisation  @xcite , thermal expansion  @xcite and resistivity  @xcite experiments suggest that this `` bad metal '' may in fact represent the _ coexistence _ of fermi - liquid - like and insulating phases .",
    "the presence of both metallic and insulating states at low temperatures is probably related to progressive freezing - in of disorder associated with the terminal ethylene - groups of bedt - ttf ( which can adopt either a `` staggered '' or `` eclipsed '' configuration ) and/or with the anions , @xmath18  @xcite . as",
    "yet there is no strong theoretical concurrence on the mechanism for superconductivity in the bedt - ttf salts  @xcite , with electron - electron interactions , spin fluctuations  @xcite , charge fluctuations  @xcite and electron - phonon interactions  @xcite under consideration .",
    "it is therefore unclear as to whether the mixed insulating / metallic phase referred to above is a prerequisite for or a hindrance to superconductivity .",
    "however , a recent paper has pointed out the sensitivity of the superconductivity in bedt - ttf salts to non - magnetic impurities and disorder , suggesting that this is evidence for d - wave superconductivity  @xcite .    in order to address some of these issues",
    "we have studied a new family of charge - transfer salts of the form ,  where @xmath3 is a magnetic [ cr@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , fe@xmath19 ( @xmath21 ) ] or non - magnetic [ ga@xmath19 ( @xmath22 ) ] ion and @xmath6 is a solvent molecule such as c@xmath9h@xmath9n ( pyridine ) , c@xmath23h@xmath9cn ( benzonitrile ) or c@xmath23h@xmath9no@xmath4 ( nitrobenzene ) .",
    "@xmath6 essentially acts as a template molecule , helping to stabilize the structure ; its size and electronegativity affect the unit cell volume , and the amount of disorder in the system  @xcite .",
    "the unit - cell volume is also affected by changing the @xmath3 ion inside the tris(oxalate ) structure  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a subsidiary motive for varying @xmath3 is to search for potential role for magnetism in the mechanism for superconductivity  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the magnetic charge - transfer salt @xmath24-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath1  @xcite has been found to exhibit a field - induced superconducting state in fields @xmath25  t. whilst these data appear to be explicable by the jaccarino - peter compensation effect  @xcite , others have suggested that the fe ions play some role in the superconducting state  @xcite .     for  samples containing different @xmath6 molecules and transition metal ions @xmath3 .",
    "data are shifted vertically for clarity .",
    "salts with ( a ) @xmath6=c@xmath23h@xmath9no@xmath4 or ( b ) @xmath8 c@xmath23h@xmath9cn typically exhibit superconductivity , negative magnetoresistance and a simple set of shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
    "by contrast , the ( c ) @xmath8 c@xmath9n@xmath9n ( pyridine ) salt shows no superconductivity , positive magnetoresistance and a complex series of shubnikov - de haas oscillations ; this is entirely typical of the salts containing pyridine .",
    ", width=283 ]    although there are many detailed differences between individual samples , the  salts show two distinct classes of low - temperature behavior , as summarised in fig .",

    "@xmath8 c@xmath9h@xmath9n are not superconducting ; they exhibit positive magnetoresistance , and display a complex mixture of higher - frequency shubnikov - de haas oscillations . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the @xmath8 c@xmath9n@xmath9n salts , deriving their fermi - surface parameters and quasiparticle scattering rates ; the superconductors with @xmath8 c@xmath23h@xmath9cn or c@xmath23h@xmath9no@xmath4 are described in detail in another paper  @xcite .",
    "however , in deriving a general phase diagram ( section  [ discussion ] ) we shall discuss the latter superconducting materials in general terms alongside the @xmath8 c@xmath9h@xmath9n salts .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "experimental details are given in section  [ experiment ] ; relevant structural details and the behavior of the  samples on cooling from room to cryogenic temperatures are given in section  [ structure ] , which also outlines the mechanisms which introduce disorder .",
    "magnetoresistance data are analysed in section  [ magnetoresistance ] ; the shubnikov - de haas oscillations suggest that there are four fermi - surface pockets , the areas of which obey the additive relationship expected for a compensated semimetal .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ discussion ] ; this section contains a notional phase diagram for the  salts which shows the influence of unit cell size and disorder , and which is compared with an equivalent phase diagram for the @xmath12(bedt - ttf)@xmath4x salts .",
    "a summary is given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the  samples were grown using electrocrystallisation techniques as described elsewhere  @xcite ; they are generally @xmath28  mm@xmath29 hexagonal platelets or needles .",
    "it is possible to deduce the upper and lower faces that are parallel to the highly - conducting quasi - two - dimensional planes by visual inspection .",
    "electrical contacts were made to these surfaces by using graphite paint to attach @xmath30 m platinum wires .",
    "the interlayer ( magneto)resistance @xmath31 @xmath32 ( ref .  ) was measured using standard four - terminal ac techniques .",
    "this involves driving the current and measuring the voltage between pairs of contacts on the upper and lower surfaces  @xcite .",
    "magnetoresistance experiments were carried out in quasistatic fields provided by a superconductive magnet in oxford and a 33  t bitter coil at nhmfl tallahassee .",
    "the crystals were mounted in a @xmath29he cryostat which allowed rotation to all possible orientations in magnetic field ; sample orientation is defined by the angle @xmath33 between the direction of the magnetic field and the normal to the quasi - two dimensional planes and the azimuthal angle @xmath34 .",
    "sample currents between 1 and 25  @xmath35a were used at typical frequencies 18 - 300  hz . although around 20 crystals have been studied , in this paper we shall focus on two or three typical samples of each salt ; samples are distinguished by the consistent use of a label ( _ e.g. _ @xmath7  cr , sample  a ) .",
    ".lattice parameters of  salts ( @xmath36 symmetry group ) measured around 120  k. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a further insight into the properties of our samples is given by the dingle temperature , @xmath37 , which can be used to parameterise the scattering rate  @xcite , the spatial potential fluctuations or a combination of the two  @xcite .",

    "[ pyrm](b ) .",
    "note that @xmath37 is consistently larger for the compounds with @xmath7fe ( @xmath39  k , corresponding to a scattering time of @xmath40  ps ) and is smaller for the salts with @xmath7cr ( @xmath41  k , corresponding to @xmath42  ps ) .",

    "the field windows overlapped by less than @xmath51%.,width=226 ]    this difference is visible even in the raw data , with fewer oscillations being visible for the @xmath7fe salt . as both compounds contain magnetic ions , some form of magnetic scattering ( such as spin - disorder scattering  @xcite ) may be excluded as the reason for these differences ; it is more likely to be related to the degree of nonmagnetic disorder present , determined by the anions and the solvent .    interestingly",
    ", there is no apparent correlation between the values of @xmath52  k ) ( see figure  [ pyrrvst ] ) and the dingle temperatures for each sample ( table  [ fspar ] ) . for example , the sample with the largest @xmath52  k)(@xmath53 ) ( @xmath7 cr , sample a ) has a @xmath37 which is a factor 2.2 smaller than that of the sample with the smallest @xmath52  k)(@xmath54 ) ( @xmath7 fe , sample a ) .",
    "the dingle temperatures extracted from shubnikov - de haas oscillations suggest that @xmath7 cr sample a is of higher quality , whereas @xmath7 fe sample a has the lower resistivity ratio .",
    "this strongly suggests that the samples are not of a uniform single phase at the lowest temperatures but their overall properties probably represent a mixture of metallic and insulating domains . within this mixture",
    ", the metallic domains may well be of quite high quality , as evidenced by the observation of shubnikov - de haas oscillations with a reasonably small dingle temperature .",
    "further support for such an idea is given by comparing the values of @xmath55k@xmath56  k)@xmath57 seen in fig .",
    "[ pyrrvst ] with @xmath55k@xmath56  k)@xmath58 obtained for the unambiguously metallic salt @xmath59(bedt - ttf)@xmath4i@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this great disparity is an indication that a large fraction of the quasiparticles in the  salts that are mobile at room temperature do not contribute to the bulk conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "this loss of charge - carriers is presumably be related to the suggested density - wave transition at @xmath60 ( which perhaps gaps part of the fermi surface ) and to the subsequent `` freezing out '' of further quasiparticles ( suggested by the negative @xmath61 values seen for several of the samples as shown in figure  [ pyrrvst ] ) caused by disorder at lower temperatures .",
    "the previous sections have described the transport properties of  salts exhibiting a metal - insulator transition at @xmath60 ( probably associated with a density - wave state ) and shubnikov - de haas oscillations at lower temperatures , indicative of a reasonably good metal . however , depending on the sample batch , the overall resistivity can be much greater than that at room temperature ; the most likely explanation is that the sample consists of a mixture of metallic and insulating domains .",
    "the tendency for a particular region of the sample to remain metallic or become insulating may be linked to particular configurations of the anion and/or ethylene groups possible in the  salts ( see the discussion of intrinsic disorder in section  [ structure ] ) .",
    "these findings are summarised in figure  [ phd](a ) , which shows a notional phase diagram for all of the  salts as a function of `` chemical pressure '' ( @xmath62 ) , _ i.e. _ the fractional difference in unit - cell volume of a particular salt from that of the @xmath7 fe , @xmath8 c@xmath23h@xmath9no@xmath4 compound , which has the largest unit cell . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ phd](7 ) shows an analogous diagram for the @xmath12(bedt - ttf)@xmath4x salts ( after ref .",
    "based on refs .  ) .",
    "there are a number of quite striking similarities between the two phase diagrams .    1 .",
    "the superconductivity is suppressed by the reduction in volume of the unit cell .",
    "the suppression of superconductivity is accompanied by the increasingly `` metallic '' character of both families of materials ; in the salts , this is evidenced by the increase in the number and size of fermi - surface pockets observed ( two for @xmath8 c@xmath23h@xmath9no@xmath4 , c@xmath23h@xmath9cn , four , generally larger ones for @xmath8 c@xmath9h@xmath9n ) ; in the @xmath16-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4x salts this shows up as an increase in the shubnikov - de haas oscillation frequencies and the low - frequency optical conductivity  @xcite .",
    "this trend is confirmed by hydrostatic pressure measurements of the superconducting @xmath63-bedt - ttf@xmath1[(h@xmath2o)ga(c@xmath4o@xmath1)@xmath2]@xmath64 salts , which showed that the superconductivity is destroyed and the number of fermi - surface pockets increased by increasing pressure  @xcite .",
    "2 .   as the chemical pressure increases , the suggested density - wave transitions ( which occurs at @xmath60 in the  salts and at @xmath65 in the @xmath12(bedt - ttf)@xmath4x compounds ) increases in temperature , at least initially . + .",
    "solid circles correspond to the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath15 , open circles represent the metal - insulator transition , @xmath60 .",
    "the other temperatures , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are described in the text .",
    "different phases are : sc = superconducting , dw - density wave , m - metallic , pm - paramagnetic metallic and i - insulating phase .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are guides to the eye .",

    "[ 9 ] based on refs .",
    "[ 4,8,10]).,width=283 ] + in this context , recall that the characteristic activation energy @xmath69 ( section  [ structure ] ) also increases with chemical pressure .",
    "3 .   in both families",
    ", the superconducting state is surrounded by regions in which metallic and insulating behavior coexist `` pm + dw '' phase ( in the @xmath16-phase salts after ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the  salts seem to emphasise two emerging themes in the physics of organic ( super)conductors .",
    "firstly , there have been a number of recent instances in which very high sample resistivity and phenomena indicative of quasiparticle localisation ( _ e.g. _ anderson localisation  @xcite ) and/or disorder  @xcite coexist with effects normally associated with `` good metals '' , such as shubnikov - de haas oscillations  @xcite or even superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "secondly , there is experimental evidence that the precursor to superconductivity may involve the coexistence of metallic and density - wave - like states ( for example  @xcite or it has been suggested in the case of the @xmath12phase salts  @xcite that these phases exist in distinct `` domains '' or regions of the sample , the behavior of a particular domain being determined by local structural arrangements .",
    "finally , recent theoretical work has emphasised the role of disorder in the suppression of superconductivity in ( bedt - ttf ) salts .",
    "often a measure of this disorder is derived from shubnikov - de haas - oscillation or cyclotron - resonance data  @xcite .",
    "the resistivity data indicate that disorder makes some regions of the samples prone to localisation and these regions contribute little to the low - temperature conductivity .",
    "other regions remain metallic and exhibit shubnikov - de haas oscillations , indicative of reasonably long scattering times and mean - free paths @xmath70   and hence low disorder .",
    "thus it is important to emphasise that shubnikov - de haas and cyclotron resonance data are only informative about the disorder in the metallic regions of a sample ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the fermi - surface topology of ,   ( with @xmath7 ga , cr , fe and @xmath8c@xmath9h@xmath71n ) .",
    "all of the studied salts exhibit similar shubnikov - de haas - oscillation spectra , which we attribute to four quasi - two - dimensional fermi - surface pockets .",
    "the cross - sectional areas of the pockets are in agreement with the expectations for a compensated semimetal , and the corresponding effective masses are @xmath11 , rather small compared to those of other bedt - ttf salts .",
    "apart from the case of the smallest fermi - surface pocket , varying the @xmath3 ion seems to have little effect on the overall fermi - surface topology or on the effective masses .",
    "despite the fact that all samples show quantum oscillations at low temperatures , indicative of fermi liquid behavior , the sample- and temperature - dependence of the interlayer resistivity lead us to suggest that these systems are intrinsically inhomogeneous .",
    "it is thought that intrinsic tendency to disorder in the anions and/or the ethylene groups of the bedt - ttf molecules leads to phase separation of the samples into insulating and metallic states .",
    "based on the data in this paper , and those from ref .",
    ", we have constructed a notional phase diagram for the  salts which exhibits several similarities with that of the @xmath12(bedt - ttf)@xmath4x superconductors , and which could have larger implications for other charge - transfer salts .",

    "<S> the cross - sectional areas of the pockets are in agreement with the expectations for a compensated semimetal , and the corresponding effective masses are @xmath11 , rather small compared to those of other bedt - ttf salts . apart from the case of the smallest fermi - surface pocket </S>",
    "<S> , varying the @xmath3 ion seems to have little effect on the overall fermi - surface topology or on the effective masses . </S>",
    "<S> despite the fact that all samples show quantum oscillations at low temperatures , indicative of fermi liquid behavior , the sample- and temperature - dependence of the interlayer resistivity suggest that these systems are intrinsically inhomogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> it is thought that intrinsic tendency to disorder in the anions and/or the ethylene groups of the bedt - ttf molecules leads to the coexistence of insulating and metallic states at low temperatures ; comparison with other charge - transfer salts suggests that this might be a rather general phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> a notional phase diagram is given for the general family of  salts , which exhibits several marked similarities with that of the @xmath12(bedt - ttf)@xmath4x superconductors . </S>"
