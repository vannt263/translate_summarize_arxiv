    "higher dark matter densities are possible for dark matter particles captured inside of stars or planets .",
    "any star close enough to an adiabatically grown such a smbh can capture a large number of wimps during a short period of time .",
    "annihilation of captured wimps may lead to considerable energy release in stellar cores thus affecting the evolution and appearance of such stars .",
    "such an idea has been first proposed in @xcite and further developed in @xcite who applied it to main - sequence stars .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of the wimp capture rates for stars of various masses and evolution stages @xcite lead us to the conclusion that wds , fully burned stars without their own energy supply , are the most promising candidates to look for .",
    "wimp capture by wds or degenerate cores with envelopes located in a high density dark matter region has been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "a high wimp concentration in the stellar interior may affect the evolution and appearance of a star .",
    "the effects of wimps can be numerous , here we list only a few .",
    "the additional source of energy from wimp pair - annihilation may cause convective energy transport from the stellar interior when radiative transport is not effective enough . in turn",
    ", this may inflate the stellar radius .",
    "on the other hand , wimps themselves may provide energy transport and suppress convection in the stellar core ; this would reduce the replenishment of the thermonuclear burning region with fresh fuel .",
    "the appearance of massive stars and the bare wds should not change , however .",
    "the former are too luminous , @xmath0 , while the energy transport in the latter is dominated by the degenerate electrons . here",
    "we discuss observational features of dm burners , and glast s role in checking this hypothesis .      *",
    "the bare wds burning dm should be hot , with luminosity maximum falling into the uv or x - ray band .",
    "the number of very hot wds in the sdss catalog @xcite is small , just a handful out of 9316 .",
    "this means that observation of a concentration of very hot wds at the gc would be extremely unlikely unless they are `` dm burners . ''",
    "* identification of dm burners may be possible by combining the data obtained by several experiments : * * glast @xmath1-ray measurements from the gc can be used to identify a putative dm spike at the smbh , and also measure the annihilation flux from the spike .",
    "identification of the dm spike requires a detection of a point source at the gc ( i.e. not extended ) centered on the smbh ( i.e. with no offset ) , and a source spectrum matching a wimp of a particular mass , which agrees with the `` universal '' wimp mass as determined by any other putative wimp signals ( i.e. from colliders , direct detection , other indirect detection ) . * * direct measurement of the wimp - nucleon scattering cross - section fixes the wimp capture rate and thus the wimp burner luminosity for a given degenerate core . *",
    "* determination of stellar orbits would allow a calculation of the wimp burning rate by a particular star and , therefore , the proportion of its luminosity which is coming from the wimp burning .",

    "<S> here we compare our results with the observed stars closest to the galactic center and find that they could be consistent with wimp burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> we also cross - check the wimp burner hypothesis with the egret observed flux of gamma - rays from the galactic center , which imposes a constraint on the dark matter spike density profile and annihilation cross - section . </S>",
