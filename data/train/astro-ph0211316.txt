    "disk accretion onto a magnetic star occurs in a variety of astrophysical contexts , including accreting neutron stars , white dwarfs and pre - main - sequence stars ( e.g. , frank et al .  1992 ) . the basic picture of disk ",
    "magnetosphere interaction is well - known : at large radii the disk is unaffected by the stellar magnetic field ; a somewhat sudden transition occurs when the stellar field disrupts the disk at the magnetospheric boundary , and channels the plasma onto the polar caps of the star .",
    "the magnetosphere boundary is located where the magnetic and plasma stresses balance , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the mass and magnetic moment of the central star , @xmath3 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath4 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "because of its intrinsic importance for a wide range of astrophysical systems , a large number of theoretical papers have been written on the subject of the interaction between accretion disks and magnetized stars ( see references in lai 1999 and in shirakawa & lai 2002a , b ) , and numerical study of this problem is still in its infancy .",
    "outstanding issues remain , including the efficiency of field dissipation in / outside the disk , whether the disk excludes the stellar field by diamagnetic currents or the field can penetrate a large fraction of the disk , whether the threaded field remains closed ( connecting the star and the disk ) or becomes open by differential shearing , and whether / how magnetically driven wind is launched from the disk or the magnetosphere / corotation boundary .",
    "many previous theoretical papers have , for simplicity , adopted the idealied geometry in which the magnetic axis , the spin axis and the disk angular momentum are aligned .",
    "however , in lai ( 1999 ) , it was shown that under quite general conditions , the stellar magnetic field can induce warping in the inner disk and make the disk precess around the spin axis ( see  2 ) .",
    "such magnetically driven warping and precession open up new possibilities for the dynamical behaviors of disk accretion onto magnetic stars , and may explain some of the observed variabilities in different stars ( including compact objects ) .",
    "lai ( 1999 ) shows that the inner region of the accretion disk onto a rotating magnetized central star is subjected to magnetic torques which induce warping and precession of the disk .",
    "the origin of these torques lies in these magnetic torques result from the interactions between the accretion disk and the stellar magnetic field .",
    "depending on how the disk responds to the stellar field , two different kinds of torque arise : ( i ) if the vertical stellar magnetic field @xmath5 penetrates the disk , it gets twisted by the disk rotation to produce an azimuthal field @xmath6 that has different signs above and below the disk ( @xmath7 is the azimuthal pitch of the field line and depends on the dissipation in the disk ) , and a radial surface current @xmath8 results .",
    "the interaction between @xmath8 and the stellar @xmath9 gives rise to a vertical force . while the mean force ( averaging over the azimuthal direction ) is zero",
    ", the uneven distribution of the force induces a net _ warping torque _ which tends to misalign the angular momentum of the disk with the stellar spin axis .",
    "( ii ) if the disk does not allow the vertical stellar field ( e.g. , the rapidly varying component of @xmath5 due to stellar rotation ) to penetrate , an azimuthal screening current @xmath10 will be induced on the disk .",
    "this @xmath10 interacts with the radial magnetic field @xmath11 and produces a vertical force .",
    "the resulting _ precessional torque _ tends to drive the disk into retrograde precession around the stellar spin axis .    in general , both the magnetic warping torque and the precessional torque are present . for small disk tilt angle @xmath12 ( the angle between the disk normal and the spin axis ) , the precession angular frequency and warping rate at radius @xmath13",
    "are given by & & _ p ( r)=f ( ) , [ eqn : omega_p ] + & & _ w ( r)=^2 , [ eqn : gamma_w ] where @xmath2 is the stellar magnetic dipole moment , @xmath14 is the angle between the magnetic dipole axis and the spin axis , @xmath15 is the orbital angular frequency , and @xmath16 is the surface density of the disk . [",
    "note that the stellar spin frequency @xmath17 does not appear in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) & ( 3 ) since the variation of the field geometry due to the spin has been averaged out ; this is justified because @xmath18 . ]",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath19 is given by d(r)=max  ( , ) [ eqn : d(r ) ] , where @xmath20 is the half - thickness and @xmath21 is the inner radius of the disk .",
    "the function @xmath22 depends on the dielectric property of the disk .",
    "we can write f()=2f^2-^2 , so that @xmath23 if only the spin - variable vertical field is screened out by the disk ( @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 if all vertical field is screened out ( @xmath26 ) . in reality",
    ", @xmath27 lies between 0 and 1 . for concreteness",
    ", we shall set @xmath23 in the following .",
    "we also note the effect of _ magnetically driven resonances_. for a general magnetic field ",
    "disk geometry , the vertical magnetic force on a disk element varies with the stellar rotation period .",
    "this gives rise to a number of _ vertical resonances _ in the disk .",
    "similarly . there exist _ epicyclic resonances _ due to the time - dependent radial magnetic force .",
    "although the force expressions are model - dependent , the existence of the resonances appears to be inevitable .",
    "these magnetically driven resonances are somewhat similar to the corotation resonance and lindblad resonances in gravitational systems .",
    "the resonances may act as an extra source ( in addition to the non - resonant precessional and warping torques discussed above ) for generating bending waves and spiral waves in the disk . near the resonances ,",
    "fluid elements undergo large out - of - plane and radial excursions , which may lead to thickening of the disk .",
    "this may be analogous to the lorentz resonances ( which occur when charged particles move around a rotating magnetic field ) in the jovian ring ( e.g. , schaffer & burns 1992 ) .",
    "however , because of the fluid nature of the disk , the resonances may not lead to sharp edges in the disk .",
    "since the magnetic torque drives the disk tilt , while the viscosity reduces the tilt , one can derive the criterion for the warping instability . roughly speaking",
    ", the disk warp can grow if the timescale associated with the warping torque is shorter than the viscous time @xmath28 [ where @xmath29 is the viscosity ( measuring the @xmath13-@xmath30 stress ) associated with reducing disk tilt ] . since the warping torque is a steep function of @xmath13 , the warping instability occurs only inside a critical radius @xmath31 . our analysis ( lai 1999 ) shows that local warping torque can overcome viscous damping when _ w > 2 ^ 2_2r^2 .",
    "[ criterion]assuming that @xmath32 is independent of @xmath13 , the above equation reduces to r < r_w=(3 ^ 28 ^ 2_1_2 ) ^2/7(^4gmm^2)^1/7 , where we have used @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a dimensionless function of @xmath13 which approaches unity in the region far from the inner edge of the disk . thus @xmath31 is typically a few times the canonical alfven radius ( the magnetosphere boundary ) .",
    "therefore , as the disk approaches the magnetosphere , its normal vector @xmath35 will tend to be tilted with respect to the stellar spin even if at large radii it is aligned with the spin axis .",
    "another aspect of the viscous effect is what we call `` _ magnetic bardeen - petterson effect _ '' .",
    "because of the magnetic precessional torque , the tilted disk will be driven into differential precession ( with the precession rate dependent on @xmath13 ) . by analogy with the well - known bardeen - petterson effect (",
    "i.e. , the inner region of an accretion disk undergoing lense - thirring precession around a rotating black hole tends to align itself with the equatorial plane of the black hole ; see bardeen & petterson 1975 ) , we expect that the magnetically driven precession also tends to damp the tilt of the inner disk through the action of viscosity .",
    "setting @xmath36 equal to @xmath37 , we obtain the magnetic bardeen - petterson radius : r_mbp=(3 ^ 2d_1_2)^2/7 ( ^4gmm^2)^1/7 . inside @xmath38 ,",
    "the combined effect of viscosity and precession tends to align the disk normal with the spin axis .",
    "we see that typically @xmath38 is of the same order as @xmath31 ( the warping radius ) and @xmath39 ( the magnetosphere radius ) .",
    "thus the precessional torque has an opposite effect on the disk tilt as the warping torque .",
    "however , because of the broad warp - alignment transition expected for the magnetic bardeen - petterson effect and the long timescale involved , we expect that the precession - induced alignment will be overwhelmed by the warping instability .",
    "since the precession rate @xmath40 depends strongly on @xmath13 , coupling between different rings is needed to produce a global coherent precession .",
    "the coupling can be achieved either by viscous stress or through bending waves ( e.g. , papaloizou & pringle  1983 ; papaloizou & terquem  1995 ) . in the viscosity dominated regime ( i.e. , the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath41 greater than @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the dynamics of the warps can be studied using the formalism of papaloizou & pringle ( 1983 ) ( see also ogilvie  1999 ; ogilvie & dubus  2001 ) .",
    "we model the disk as a collection of rings which interact with each other via viscous stresses .",
    "each ring at radius @xmath13 has the unit normal vector @xmath43 . in the cartesian",
    "coordinates , with the @xmath30-axis along the neutron star spin , we write @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the tilt angle and @xmath46 the twist angle . for @xmath47 , the dynamical warp equation for @xmath48 ( lai 1999 ; see papaloizou & pringle 1983 ; pringle 1992 ) reduces to an equation for @xmath49 : & & - + & & = _ 2 + i_pw+_ww,[eqn : evolution ] where @xmath50 ( we assume that the ratio of @xmath29 to @xmath51 is constant ) . in deriving the above equation , we have used the relations for the radial velocity and surface density : @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the values and functional forms of @xmath51 , @xmath29 , @xmath36 , @xmath54 and",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath55 depend on disk models ( see shirakawa & lai 2002a , b for details ) .",
    "shirakawa & lai ( 2002 ) carried out a global analysis of warping / precession modes in a viscous accretion disk , and show that under a wide range of conditions , the magnetic warping torque can overcome viscous damping and make the mode grow .",
    "the warping / precession modes are concentrated near the inner edge of the disk ( at the magnetosphere - disk boundary ) , and can give rise to variabilities or quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray / uv / optical fluxes from x - ray pulsars ( see  4 ) .",
    "pfeiffer & lai ( 2003 ) studied the nonlinear evolution of the warping - precession modes , and found that the mode tends to saturate at a large amplitude ( its value depends on the parameters of the system ) .",
    "the implications of such nonlinear behavior remain to be understood .",
    "the magnetically driven warping instability and precession help explaining a number of observational puzzles related to stellar variabilities ( for more details , see lai 1999 ; shirakawa & lai 2002ab ; pfeiffer & lai 2003 ) .    : quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo s ) with frequencies @xmath56  mhz have been detected in at least 11 accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "these mhz qpos are often interpreted in terms of the beat frequency model ( bfm ) , in which the observed qpo frequency represents the beat between the keplerian frequency @xmath57 at the inner disk radius and the ns spin frequency @xmath58 , or in terms of the keplerian frequency model ( kfm ) , in which the qpos arise from the modulation of the x - rays by some inhomogeneities in the inner disk at the keplerian frequency .",
    "however for several sources , more than one qpos have been detected and the difference in the qpo frequencies is not equal to the spin frequency .",
    "thus kfm and/or the bfm can not be the whole story . also note that in both the kfm and the bfm , it is always postulated that the inner disk contain some blobs or inhomogeneities , whose physical origin is unclear .",
    "in shirakawa & lai ( 2002 ) we suggest a `` magnetic disk precession model '' for the mhz variabilities and qpos of accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "the magnetically driven precession of the warped inner disk ( outside but close to the magnetosphere boundary ) can modulate x - ray / uv / optical flux in several ways .",
    "we identify @xmath59 with the global precession frequency driven by the magnetic torques .",
    "our calculations show that under a wide range of conditions , the warping / precession mode is concentrated near the disk inner edge , and the global mode frequency is equal to @xmath60 ( depending on details of the disk structure ) times the magnetically driven precession frequency at @xmath61 .",
    "an examination of the observed properties of mhz qpos in several systems ( such as 4u 1626 - 67 ) suggests that some hitherto unexplained qpos are likely to be results of magnetically driven disk warping / precession ( see chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 ) .    :",
    "recent long - term , continuous monitoring of x - ray pulsars with the batse instrument on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) has revealed a number of puzzling behaviors of the spins of these objects ( see bildsten et al .  1997 and references therein ) .",
    "several well - measured disk - fed systems ( e.g. , cen x-3 , gx 1 + 4 and 4u 1626 - 67 ) display sudden transitions between episodes of steady spin - up and spin - down , with the absolute values of spin torques approximately equal ( to within a factor of a few ) .",
    "the transition timescale ranges from days to years .",
    "it is likely that the magnetically driven disk warping may be a crucial ingredient in determining the spin behaviors of accreting x - ray pulsars . with the magnetic warping torque ,",
    "the perpendicular state is an `` attractor '' .",
    "the observed sign switching of @xmath62 ( spin derivative ) in several x - ray pulsars may be associated with the `` wandering '' of the inner disk around this `` attractor '' .",
    "rough estimate based on the magnetic torque indicates that the switching timescale ( which depends on the stellar field strength , the disk parameters and geometry ) ranges from days to years , in agreement with observations .    :",
    "rapid variability in low - mass x - ray binaries , containing weakly magnetized ( @xmath63  g ) neutron stars , has been studied since the discovery of the so - called horizontal - branch oscillations ( hbos ) ( see van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "the hbos are quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) ( with @xmath64-value @xmath65 of order a few ) which manifest as broad lorentzian peaks in the x - ray power spectra with centroid frequencies in the range of 1560  hz which are positively correlated with the inferred mass accretion rate .",
    "stella and vietri ( 1998 ) suggested that hbos ( and other low - frequency qpos ) are associated with lense - thirring precession of the inner accretion disk around the rotating ns . for this interpretation to be viable",
    ", the inner disk must be tilted with respect to the stellar spin axis . since the bardeen - petterson effect tends to keep the inner region of the disk ( typically within 1001000 schwarzschild radii ) co - planar with the star and radiation - driven warping",
    "is only effective at large disk radii ( pringle 1996 ) , another mechanism to drive warping in the inner disk is needed .",
    "the magnetic warping torque provides a natural source for inducing disk tilt .",
    "moreover , the magnetically driven ( retrograde ) precession rate is not negligible compared to the lense - thirring precession rate , and will contribute to the total precession ( shirakawa & lai 2002a ) .",
    "* ( iv ) long - term ( super - orbital ) variabilities in x - ray binaries ( including precession of jets ) : * the well - known examples include her x-1 ( 35 days ) , lmc x-4 ( 30.4 days ) and ss433 ( 164 days ) .",
    "it has always been thought that these super - orbital periods are caused by precession of accretion disks , perhaps driven by the binary companion .",
    "however , the tidal torque from the companion is relevant only if the disk is warped . without any extra driver for the disk warp",
    ", the disk would be flat .",
    "magnetic field may play a role here .    *",
    "( v ) photometric period variations of t tauri stars : * t tauri stars have magnetic fields of order 1  kg . being magnetic ,",
    "they are variable .",
    "most of the variabilities can be explained by rotating cold spots or hot spots on the stellar surface .",
    "however , some of the variabilities in classical t tauri stars are not easy to understand in this picture .",
    "for example , aa tauri shows photometric variability ( by 1 mag ) in different bands on timescales of 8.5  days , but there is no clear color variation ( see bouvier et al .",
    "this and some other features can be naturally explained by a warped inner disk which causes occultation of the photosphere ( see carpenter et al .",
    "2001 for possibly other examples ) ."
