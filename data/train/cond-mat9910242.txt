    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite is a much studied model both from a mathematical and physical viewpoint .",
    "the model comprises particles hopping in a preferred direction on a lattice with hard core exclusion imposed . in the mathematical literature",
    "the interest lies in its being a simple realisation of interacting markov processes @xcite and much progress has been made in proving existence theorems , invariant measures and hydrodynamic limits @xcite .",
    "early applications concerned biophysical problems such as single - filing constraint in transport across membranes @xcite and the kinetics of biopolymerisation @xcite .",
    "more recently the asep has achieved the status of a fundamental non - equilibrium model due to its intimate relation to growth phenomena and the kpz equation @xcite , the problem of directed polymers in a random media @xcite and its use as a microscopic model for driven diffusive systems @xcite and shock formation @xcite .",
    "last but not least many traffic flow models are based on variants of the asep @xcite . adding to its appeal is the fact that many exact results have been obtained , particularly in one dimension , allowing an analytical understanding of the non - equilibrium phenomena exhibited @xcite .    in recent years",
    "the open boundary problem , where particles attempt to enter at the left of a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath6 sites with rate @xmath7 , hop to the right under a hard core exclusion constraint and exit at the right with rate @xmath8 , has been of considerable interest .",
    "it was first pointed out by krug that boundary - induced phase transitions can occur @xcite and it has further been shown that spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place when two oppositely moving particle species are introduced @xcite .",
    "the door was opened to the analytical study of the open boundary model and its non - equilibrium steady state in @xcite . there , exact recursion relations on the steady state weights were obtained and density profiles and currents were worked out exactly for the case @xmath9 .",
    "also a mean field phase diagram in the @xmath7@xmath8 plane was derived .",
    "then the recursion relations were used to calculate correlation functions for the case @xmath10 @xcite . in @xcite a different method , to be referred to as the matrix approach ,",
    "was proposed : it was shown that the steady state weights can written as a product of matrices which are in general of infinite dimension and non - commuting .",
    "the matrices obey algebraic rules which replace the recursion relations found in @xcite .",
    "this approach gives the full solution of the model including the phase diagram and density profiles and allows , in principle , calculation of all equal time correlation functions .",
    "further it admits generalisation to other models .",
    "it should be noted that the phase diagram and density profiles were also obtained independently working from the recursion relations @xcite . subsequently the matrix approach has been used to solve new models with several species @xcite and various updating schemes @xcite , to calculate shock profiles on an infinite system @xcite and to recover some previously known results @xcite .    the phase diagram obtained for the one species open boundary case @xcite comprises three phases : a low density phase , a high density phase and a maximal current phase where generic long range correlations occur .",
    "this phase diagram appears quite robust for driven diffusive systems with open boundaries @xcite .",
    "also it has been shown that different types of updates the same generic phase diagram pertains , except in simple cases of deterministic bulk dynamics where the maximal current phase is absent @xcite .",
    "the partially asymmetric exclusion process is a generalisation of the model where particles are able to hop to the left as well as to the right .",
    "the case of partial asymmetry is of interest since it allows one to interpolate between symmetric exclusion which can have equilibrium steady states and the far from equilibrium asymmetric system . in the context of growth phenomena",
    "the two different systems are described by edwards - wilkinson and kpz universality classes @xcite and the crossover phenomena has been of interest @xcite .",
    "a parameter @xmath0 gives the ratio of hopping rates to the left and to the right ; thus @xmath11 recovers the totally asymmetric process and @xmath12 gives the fully symmetric case .",
    "furthermore in the range @xmath13 there exists what we shall refer to as the _ forward bias _ regime where particles hop preferentially to the right and the boundary conditions are such that a steady state current of particles to the right is supported . in contrast , when @xmath2 particles can only enter at the left and leave at the right but hop preferentially to the left in the bulk . a steady state current of particles to the right",
    "can then be supported by the boundary conditions _ against _ the bulk bias .",
    "this gives rise to a new phase which we analyse for the first time here .",
    "we show that the current decreases exponentially with the length of the system .",
    "this phase is of interest in the context of ` backbend dynamics ' @xcite where , for example , a fluid in a permeable medium has to traverse a pore oriented against the direction of gravity .",
    "it also appears that such a reverse bias phase is relevant to recently reported one - dimensional phase separation @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the generalisation of the matrix approach to the partially asymmetric exclusion process was pointed out .",
    "this was used in @xcite to obtain approximate expressions for the current in the forward bias case for large system size .",
    "it was also pointed out that the matrices for the partially asymmetric case are closely related to creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator . in @xcite",
    "the quadratic algebra was studied and curves in the parameter space were deduced for which finite matrices could be used . along these curves exact expressions for physical quantities , such as the current and correlation length , can be computed easily .",
    "also , in the symmetric case @xmath12 the steady state is straightforward to solve @xcite",
    ". however exact expressions for all system sizes and parameters have remained elusive .    in this work",
    "we build on the relationship of the quadratic algebra with the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator algebra to calculate exact expressions for the current for all system sizes and parameter values .",
    "the basic approach is to use known properties , such as orthogonality and generating functions , of the @xmath0-deformed hermite polynomials associated with the quadratic algebra .",
    "this method was employed independently by @xcite to study the case of forward bias ( @xmath1 ) and a phase diagram for this regime was obtained by examining the asymptotics of the normalisation ( partition sum ) .",
    "we have been able to consider for the first time the case @xmath2 for which a less well - known set of @xmath0-hermite polynomials is required @xcite .",
    "furthermore we obtain as a main new result of our work an exact , explicit expression for the normalisation valid for _ all _ @xmath0 which encompasses all regimes : @xmath11 ( total asymmetry ) , @xmath1 ( forward bias ) , @xmath12 ( symmetric ) and @xmath2 ( reverse bias ) .",
    "this exact expression allows all physical quantities of the model to be evaluated for any system size and we use it here to obtain the asymptotic form of the current in the reverse bias regime .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  2 we define the model we consider and in section  3 we review the matrix approach and the related quadratic algebra . in section  4",
    "we discuss the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator and its relation to the quadratic algebra of the present problem .",
    "in particular , we present relevant facts such as the generating functions and orthogonality relations for the @xmath0-hermite polynomials . in section 5",
    "we derive our main results , which are exact expressions for the normalisation ( partition sum ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : intrep : q<1 ] we derive an integral expression valid for @xmath1 ( [ eqn : zint : q<1:short ] ) and in section  [ sec : intrep : q>1 ] we derive an integral expression valid for @xmath2 ( [ eqn : zint : q>1:short ] ) .",
    "we then obtain in section  [ sec : sumformula ] a finite sum expression valid for all @xmath0 ( [ eqn : zsumrep ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : phasediag ] we use the exact expressions to calculate the asymptotic behaviour of the current and the phase diagram .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclude ] with a discussion .",
    "the microscopic dynamics of the model are specified by four rates at which certain events can occur . for a rate @xmath14 associated with a particular event ,",
    "the probability that the event happens in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , moves that would lead to two particles simultaneously occupying a single lattice site are prohibited due to the hard - core repulsion between them .    the events defined in the model and the rates at which they take place are as follows .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     we can now draw a phase diagram for the system when @xmath1 : see figure [ fig : phasediag : q<1 ] .",
    "we note that it has the same structure as that found for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the region @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a maximal current phase ; the remaining two phases correspond to the high and low density phases found by @xcite .",
    "each of these two latter phases may be subdivided into three regions according to the behaviour of the density correlation length in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the model when @xmath1 .",
    "the thick solid line is a first order transition and the thin solid lines are second order transitions in the sense of @xcite . ]",
    "we turn now to the case @xmath2",
    ". we will show shortly by examining the exact formula ( [ eqn : zsumrep ] ) that the normalisation behaves like @xmath19 for large @xmath6 .",
    "this sheds further light on why the saddle - point method is not applicable here : by its nature , it gives expressions where the exponent is linear in @xmath6 rather than the desired quadratic .    to proceed",
    "we must find approximate forms of two elementary quantities : the @xmath0-shifted factorial and the @xmath0-binomial coefficient .",
    "we rewrite the definition ( [ eqn : qfacdef ] ) as @xmath20 where @xmath21 we see that when @xmath22 is large , @xmath23 can be approximated by @xmath24 which is independent of @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to an approximation of the @xmath0-binomial coefficient @xmath25}{0pt}{}{\\,n\\,}{\\,k\\,}_{\\!q } } } \\simeq q^{k(n - k ) } e^{-m(q)}\\ ] ] which is valid when both @xmath22 and @xmath26 are large .",
    "the rest of the analysis is not particularly illuminating , so is presented in appendix c. we ultimately find that when @xmath2 @xmath27 where @xmath28 we should note that the smallest system size @xmath6 for which ( [ eqn : z : q>1 ] ) holds will be a function of @xmath0 due to difference between the exact quantity @xmath23 and the approximate form we used @xmath29 .",
    "the expression for the current follows quickly from ( [ eqn : jdef ] ) .",
    "this reads @xmath30 which , in contrast with the currents in the forward bias regime , is a function of the number of lattice sites @xmath6 .",
    "in this work we have employed properties of @xmath0-hermite polynomials to calculate exact steady state properties of the partially asymmetric exclusion process .",
    "the connection between this model and @xmath0-hermite polynomials lies in the fact that the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the matrix product solution can be written in terms of @xmath0-raising and @xmath0-lowering operators as in ( [ eqn : dofa ] ) .",
    "then the calculation of the normalisation ( [ eqn : zdef ] ) amounts to decomposing the vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 onto the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath35 which are the eigenvectors of the `` co - ordinate '' operator of the q - deformed oscillator .",
    "this allowed us to obtain integral representations of the normalisation for both the forward bias case @xmath1 ( [ eqn : zint : q<1:short ] ) and the reverse bias case @xmath2 ( [ eqn : zint : q>1:short ] ) .",
    "further we could use orthogonality properties of the @xmath0-hermite polynomials to express these two integral expressions as a finite sum valid for all @xmath0 ( [ eqn : zsumrep ] ) .    in a very recent paper @xcite",
    ", orthogonal polynomials were also used to study the asep . in view of the fact that our work and @xcite were carried out independently ,",
    "a comparison is in order . in @xcite , the large system size limits of the normalisation and the current in the forward bias regime @xmath1 via the integral representation ( [ eqn : zint : q<1:short ] ) were obtained .",
    "furthermore it was shown that one could also analyse the density correlations from this integral . in the present work we have found that a corresponding integral",
    "can also be found for the case of reverse bias @xmath2 .",
    "further for all values of @xmath0 ( and @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) we have succeeded in obtaining an exact sum formula valid for all system sizes .",
    "one application of this general expression was to calculate the current in the reverse bias phase .",
    "for the forward bias case the phase diagram proposed by sandow @xcite is recovered . in",
    "that work the more general parameter space including rates @xmath36 ( exit of particles at the left boundary ) and @xmath37 ( entry at the right ) was considered . for this case",
    "the algebra is modified @xcite to @xmath38 in principle we can generalise our method to that case .",
    "the only difference being that @xmath33 and @xmath34 specified by ( [ eqn : eonw ] ) and ( [ eqn : donv ] ) will have more complicated expressions than ( [ eqn : vofn ] ) and ( [ eqn : wofn ] ) . in the forward bias case",
    "the generalisation would not produce any new phases .",
    "however for @xmath2 allowing particles to exit at the left and enter at the right ( both @xmath39 ) would allow a left flowing current of particles to be sustained , thus destroying the reverse bias phase .",
    "the reverse bias phase where the boundary conditions impose a current opposite to the bulk bias realises a new phase in the asep where the current decreases exponentially with system size .",
    "a typical arrangement of particles in this phase is a lattice full at the left end and empty at the right end .",
    "the form for the current @xmath40 ( [ eqn : j : q>1 ] ) suggests that the lattice is typically half - full _",
    "i.e. _ the furthest particle to the right has typically to traverse a distance of @xmath41 sites against the bias to exit the lattice . to understand why the lattice is half full",
    "one invokes the particle hole symmetry that the current of particles exiting to the right must equal the current of holes exiting to the left .",
    "the symmetry implies that the lattice must be half - full @xcite .",
    "further , for large @xmath6 the current tends to zero and one can compare with the much simpler case where the current is exactly zero , for example when the boundaries are reflecting @xcite .",
    "then the microscopic dynamics obey detailed balance and the unnormalised probability of a configuration of @xmath42 particles at positions @xmath43 will be proportional to @xmath44 . here",
    "also the normalisation grows exponentially in @xmath45 @xcite .    in a recent preprint @xcite",
    "the density profiles for the three forward bias @xmath1 phases were calculated in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in particular in the maximal current phase it was shown that the density profile decays with distance @xmath46 from the left boundary as @xmath47 for large @xmath46 .",
    "there remain , however , a number of issues to be resolved .",
    "as @xmath0 tends to @xmath48 the maximal current phase occupies more and more of the phase diagram ",
    "see figure  [ fig : phasediag : q<1 ] .",
    "however , at @xmath12 we know that the profile is exactly linear .",
    "this implies a non - trivial limit @xmath49 and therefore non - trivial crossover phenomena from the asymmetric to the symmetric case .",
    "this corresponds to the transition between kpz and ew universality classes in the related growth models .",
    "further in the reverse bias case ( @xmath2 ) , as we expect the lattice to be roughly half - full , the density profile should be sigmoid - like .",
    "for @xmath50 the profile will be a sharp step function whereas as @xmath49 the sigmoid profile will straighten out into a linear profile .",
    "it is known that the quadratic algebra ( [ eqn : decommute][eqn : donv ] ) for the open boundary problem can be used to solve a partially asymmetric periodic system with the addition of defect particles @xcite .",
    "a defect particle hops forward with rate @xmath7 but is overtaken ( and moved back a site ) by normal particles with rate @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath1 , the different phases in the present problem manifest themselves in this model @xcite . however the case @xmath2 is yet to be tackled ; we believe this to be of special interest as the reverse bias phase corresponds to phase separation into pure domains and spontaneous breaking of translational invariance @xcite .",
    "our warm thanks go to magnus richardson who contributed to the early development of this work .",
    "also we thank mike gunn who helped us with equation ( [ eqn : qfac : approx ] ) .",

    "fc thanks the epsrc for financial support and fhle is an epsrc advanced fellow .",
    "in this appendix we explain how to obtain the generating functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 from the recursion relations for the @xmath0-hermite polynomials ( [ eqn : hprecrel ] ) .",
    "we also present explicit expressions for the polynomials as they may be obtained easily from the generating functions .",
    "we consider first a general form of @xmath53 , suitable for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath54 we now obtain a functional relation for @xmath55 by multiplying both sides of equation ( [ eqn : hprecrel ] ) by @xmath56 and performing the required summations : @xmath57 by using this relation repeatedly , we can find an expression for @xmath55 in terms of @xmath58 .",
    "this latter quantity is fixed by normalisation , and so we set it to @xmath48",
    ".    it can be seen from ( [ eqn : gfuncrel ] ) that our approach from @xmath55 to @xmath58 depends on whether @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "consider first the case @xmath1 .",
    "it is useful to make the change of variable @xmath59 so that ( [ eqn : gfuncrel ] ) becomes @xmath60 iterating this we find @xmath61 where we have used @xmath62 .",
    "the infinite product @xmath63 has a well - known series representation @xcite valid for @xmath64 , @xmath1 @xmath65 from which we may extract the form of @xmath66 . expanding both sides of ( [ eqn : gnice ] ) in @xmath14 and comparing co - efficients we find @xmath67}{0pt}{}{\\,n\\,}{\\,k\\,}_{\\!q } } } e^{i(n-2k)\\theta}\\ ] ] where @xmath68}{0pt}{}{\\,n\\,}{\\,k\\,}_{\\!q}}}$ ] is the @xmath0-deformed binomial described in section [ sec : sumformula ] .",
    "the case @xmath2 proceeds in the same way .",
    "we must however make a different change of variable @xmath69 because otherwise ( [ eqn : xonx ] ) would imply that we had found imaginary eigenvalues of a hermitian matrix .",
    "also we should divide @xmath14 by @xmath0 in as we approach @xmath70 from @xmath52 .",
    "we thus re - write ( [ eqn : gfuncrel ] ) as @xmath71 and iterate before to obtain @xmath72 again the infinite product on the right - hand side of this equation has a useful series expansion appropriate for @xmath2 and all @xmath46 : @xmath73 expansion of [ eqn : gnicer ] in powers of @xmath14 and comparison with the generating function ( [ eqn : genfunc : q>1 ] ) yields @xmath74 : @xmath75}{0pt}{}{\\,n\\,}{\\,k\\,}_{\\!q } } } e^{(n-2k)u } \\;.\\ ] ]    it is important to realise that the two forms ( [ eqn : hp : q<1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : hp : q>1 ] ) we have found are not very different .",
    "in particular one can obtain the form ( [ eqn : hp : q>1 ] ) by making the substitution @xmath76 which is another way of describing the replacement @xmath77 .",
    "also we should note that all the functions we have found are real on their domains despite the presence of @xmath78 when @xmath2 .",
    "here we show how to re - write @xmath79^n$ ] as a sum of @xmath0-hermite polynomials @xmath66 .",
    "first of all we simplify the task by using an identity easily verified by induction : @xmath80^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{n } \\binom{2n}{n - n } c_n(\\theta)\\ ] ] with @xmath81    we now need only to consider the expansion of @xmath82 .",
    "it is fairly easy to convince oneself by inspecting @xmath83 that only those @xmath0-hermite polynomials of the same parity as the cosine function @xmath84 will appear in the expansion .",
    "also we do not expect any contributions from @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "this leads to the following prescription : @xmath87    a formula for @xmath88 may be found by applying the orthogonality property of the @xmath0-hermite polynomials ( [ eqn : orthog : q<1 ] ) .",
    "we obtain a familiar integral transform @xmath89 to evaluate this integral we need the series expansion of the weight function @xmath90 @xmath91 inserting this and the explicit formula for the @xmath0-hermite polynomial ( [ eqn : hp : q<1 ] ) into the above we find , after some manipulation , @xmath92}{0pt}{}{\\,n-2k\\,}{\\,r\\,}_{\\!q } } } \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\int_{0}^{2\\pi } { \\ensuremath{\\!\\!\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\ , } } \\cos((k+r - s)\\theta ) \\;.\\ ] ]    the integral that appears in this equation is just a representation of the kronecker delta symbol @xmath93 .",

    "the problem of expanding of a general function in @xmath0-hermite polynomials was first solved by rogers in 1894 .",

    "we indicate here how to estimate @xmath101 as given by ( [ eqn : zsumrep ] ) in a systematic manner when @xmath6 is large and @xmath2 . we begin with the function @xmath102 which is defined by the sum in equation ( [ eqn : bdef ] ) .",

    "the approximation @xmath113 which follows from ( [ eqn : qfac : approx ] ) and ( [ eqn : m : approx ] ) is valid in that region and when combined with the asymptotic expression for @xmath102 yields @xmath114 we are now left with a single summation which may be estimated from the identity ( [ eqn : exp : q>1 ] ) .",
