    "studies of detached eclipsing binary ( deb ) systems allow for a very precise determination of the mass and radius of the individual stellar components with uncertainties commonly below 2% . over the past two decades",
    ", these precision studies have accumulated strong evidence that the radii predicted by low - mass stellar evolution models are deflated compared to the observations , at a given mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "is that deb radii appear to be systematically 10% larger than model predictions and deb effective temperatures are 5% cooler than the models imply .",
    "further evidence has been garnered by studies of single low - mass stars @xcite , which confirm the aforementioned trends .",
    "although , @xcite present results that may be interpreted as counter to these claims .",
    "recent work has shown that the disagreements may not be as severe as previously believed , when the age and metallicity of the debs are considered @xcite .",
    "still , many deb systems display moderately inflated radii ( less than 5% ) with a small subset displaying radically inflated radii ( upward of 10% ) compared to stellar models @xcite . this modest radius offset between observations and models and the presence of strongly inflated stars",
    ", suggests that stellar evolution models must invoke new physics to account for the appearance of inflated radii .",
    "implicated as the culprit for the observed inflated radii and cooler effective temperatures is magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "the systems at the heart of the problem are often close binaries with short orbital periods . tidal synchronization of the components acts to spin - up the rotation rate of each star , enhancing the dynamo mechanism and thus supporting a stronger magnetic field within each .",
    "while there are a number of direct magnetic field measurements for single stars , there are few among fast rotating binaries . instead",
    ", the hypothesis is reinforced by the presence of strong chromospheric h@xmath0 emission @xcite , chromospheric ca  ii  h and k emission @xcite , as well as coronal x - ray emission @xcite among inflated stars .",
    "the presence of such emission features is considered to be the result of the dissipation of magnetic energy in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "there are , however , stars from debs that display inflated radii , despite existing in long - period systems .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have orbital periods of about 41 days , suggesting that the components are tidally unaffected by the presence of their companion .",
    "it is possible that these stars have not had sufficient time to shed angular momentum @xcite , preserving strong magnetic fields that they likely possessed near the zero - age main sequence .",
    "whether the low - mass stars in these systems are still magnetically active enough to affect the stellar radius remains unclear .",
    "the work by @xcite appears to suggest that kepler-16 is still relatively young ( 2  4 gyr ) as the primary is more active than the sun , based on ca ii line emission .",
    "this supports the notion that magnetic fields may be influencing the structure of each component . on the other hand , the age of lspm j1112 + 7626 , estimated from gyrochronology ,",
    "reveals that it is approximately 9  gyr old @xcite , supporting the notion that magnetic activity is likely not playing a prominent role in either star s evolution .    further complicating our picture of low - mass debs",
    ", @xcite curiously matches standard stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "the mass of koi-126 b and c and their orbital period are very similar to , one of the quintessential low - mass deb systems displaying inflated radii @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , then , that stellar evolution models would even come close to accurately predicting the observed stellar properties of koi-126 .",
    "given what is known about cm  draconis , one would expect koi-126 to display inflated radii as a consequence of moderate magnetic activity .",
    "although , @xcite speculate that koi-126 should , in fact , not be terribly active and find it unsurprising that standard models should fit the system so well .    despite the identification of a potential culprit responsible for inflating the radii of deb components , only ad hoc procedures for treating the effects of magnetic fields",
    "have been introduced @xcite .",
    "the method examined by @xcite included artificially decreasing the convective mixing - length parameter , so as to mimic the effect of a global magnetic field within the star , as well as artificially reducing the star s bolometric flux in an effort to reproduce the effects of photospheric spots .",
    "a second method , proposed by @xcite , altered the schwarzschild criterion by perturbing the adiabatic gradient in a manner consistent with the work of @xcite .",
    "investigations by both groups appear to be at odds with one another .",
    "@xcite and @xcite claim that starspots appear to be the dominate mechanism inflating stellar radii , and that modifications to convection require unrealistic magnetic field strengths ( i.e. , reductions in the mixing length in their formulation ) . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite",
    "conclude the opposite that reduction in convective efficiency is ultimately the dominant mechanism .",
    "regardless of which is really the dominant mechanism , both approaches are inherently ad hoc , yet both are capable of reproducing the observed inflated stellar radii .    in this paper , we introduce a self - consistent treatment of a globally pervasive magnetic field embedded in the framework of the dartmouth stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "our approach follows the outline provided by @xcite , though we deviate from their method in a number of ways that are described below .",
    "all of the stellar structure equations , including those in the equation of state , are self - consistently modified , as opposed to arbitrarily altering a single quantity . in this way ,",
    "modifications to the efficiency of thermal convection are accounted for in a more complete fashion , owing to the full thermodynamic treatment of the magnetic field .",
    "overall , the approach used to model magnetic effects can be considered analogous to the parameterized mixing - length treatment of convection . the viability of the models is tested against results from a recent study that characterized the deb ef  aquarii @xcite .",
    "ef  aquarii (; henceforth ef  aqr ) is a solar - type deb found to contain two components displaying drastically inflated radii @xcite .",
    "fundamental parameters of the system are quoted in table  [ tab : efaqr ] . what is most striking , is the similarity of the secondary to the sun and the entire system to a and b , in terms of the stellar masses and composition .",
    "although the secondary appears similar to both @xmath0 cen b and the sun , its radius appears to be about 10% larger than one would expect based on stellar evolutionary calculations .",
    "the effective temperature of the primary further reveals that both components suffer from substantial radius inflation .",
    "l c c @xmath1 & 1.244@xmath20.008 & 0.946@xmath20.006 + @xmath3 & 1.338@xmath20.012 & 0.956@xmath20.012 + @xmath4 ( k ) & 6150@xmath265 & 5185@xmath2110 + @xmath5 $ ] & [ tab : efaqr ]    in an effort to reconcile the observations with predictions from theoretical models , @xcite reduced the value of the convective mixing - length .",
    "they found @xmath6 of 1.30 and 1.05 were required for the primary and secondary , respectively , compared to their solar - calibrated value of 1.68 .",
    "they concluded that fine - tuning the models allows for an accurate description of the observed properties .",
    "reduction of the required convective mixing length may be physically motivated in two ways : ( 1 ) naturally inefficient convection and ( 2 ) magnetically suppressed convection . while we must be careful to not read too much into the reality of mixing - length theory , in stellar evolution models the mixing length is an intrinsic `` property '' of convection .",
    "thus , reducing the mixing length is akin to saying convection is not very efficient at transporting excess energy .",
    "@xcite calibrated the convective mixing length for solar - like stars using asteroseismic results provided by the _",
    "kepler space telescope_. they found that the value of @xmath7 in stellar models is tied to stellar properties ( i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and [ @xmath10/h ] ) . applying the @xcite empirical calibration to the stars in ef  aqr , we find that the primary and secondary component require @xmath7  =  1.68 and 1.44 , respectively .",
    "again , compared with their solar calibrated value of @xmath7  =  1.68 .",
    "the asteroseismically adjusted mixing - lengths are significantly larger than the fine - tuned values determined by @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears that naturally inefficient convection is insufficient to explain the inflated radii of ef  aqr .",
    "we are left with the option that magnetic fields may possibly be to blame .    in what is to follow ,",
    "we describe a self - consistent approach to modeling the effects of a globally pervasive magnetic field with application to the ef  aqr system .",
    "details of the standard dartmouth models are presented in section  [ sec : std_model ] followed by a description of the magnetic perturbations introduced to the code in sections  [ sec : mag ] and [ sec : num_test ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] demonstrates the ability of the invoked perturbations to reconcile the models with the observations .",
    "we conclude with a further discussion of the results and their implications in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the framework throughout which magnetic effects are invoked is provided by the dartmouth stellar evolution program ( dsep ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a descendant of the yale rotating evolution code @xcite .",
    "standard stellar evolution henceforth refers to the basic physics without any magnetic perturbation .",
    "the standard physics incorporated in dsep has been described previously @xcite , although we will briefly review the elements that are pertinent for the current study .    above @xmath11",
    ", dsep invokes an ideal gas equation of state ( eos ) supplemented by a debye - hckel correction in order to account for ion - charge shielding @xcite .",
    "this eos is computed analytically , in a self - consistent manner , within the code and does not rely on the interpolation within eos tables .",
    "opacities are drawn from two sources , the opal opacities for the high temperature regime @xcite complimented by the ferguson low - temperature opacities @xcite .",
    "surface boundary conditions are defined using the phoenix ames - cond model atmospheres @xcite , attached to the model interior where @xmath12",
    ".    atomic diffusion and the gravitational settling of helium and heavy elements are implemented using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "additional diffusion effects associated with turbulent mixing @xcite are also included .",
    "details of the latter are presented in @xcite .",
    "finally , convective core overshoot is treated following the methods outlined by @xcite .",
    "required before any analysis pertaining to stellar evolution models is calibrating the model properties to the sun .",
    "determination of the initial solar helium and heavy element mass fractions along with a compatible mixing - length parameter ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath7 , respectively ) was performed by calibrating a 1 @xmath15 model to the sun .",
    "our solar model was required to reproduce the solar radius , solar luminosity , radius at the base of the convection zone , and the solar photospheric ( @xmath16 ) at the solar age ( 4.57 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "the final set of parameters necessary to satisfy the above criteria for the @xcite solar composition was @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "investigating the effects of a global magnetic field on the interior structure of a star over long time baselines , requires formulating a purely three - dimensional ( 3d ) phenomenon in terms suitable for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) numerical model .",
    "unfortunately , full 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models are not yet capable of modeling stellar magnetic fields over the long time baselines required for stellar evolutionary calculations .",
    "this is in part due to the rapid diffusion of the magnetic field and the immense computational time required .",
    "therefore , in order to probe the effects of a magnetic field , we seek to avoid directly solving the induction equation @xmath20    while not actively seeking a solution to the full suite of 3d mhd equations , it is possible to use the theoretical framework of mhd to provide a reasonably accurate 1d description of a magnetic field and its associated properties . ultimately , we are able to describe a magnetic field in terms of the mhd equations and then project out the radial component , the component necessary for stellar evolutionary model computations",
    ".    the spatial and temporal evolution of a given magnetic field are governed , quite naturally , by maxwell s equations , @xmath21 where within the stellar plasma , we assume any regions of excess charge inducing an electric potential will rapidly neutralize owing to the mobility of other charges ( debye shielding ) .",
    "thus , we can safely assume that the plasma is electrically neutral , @xmath22 .",
    "for simplicity , we here made another assumption , that temporal variations of the large - scale field are small , suggesting that the conduction current dominates the displacement current .",
    "now , let us consider the interactions between the electric and magnetic fields within a dense , ionized fluid moving with arbitrary velocity , * u*. for slow temporal evolution , non - relativistic dynamics may be described by a single conducting fluid that obeys the classical equations of hydrodynamics coupled with the equations of electromagnetism ; the mhd equations @xcite . considering a perfectly conducting , non - viscous , non - rotating , compressible fluid in the presence of a gravitational field , the mhd equations governing the system are ohm s law for a moving fluid , @xmath23 the equation of mass continuity , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass density , and the fluid equation of motion , @xmath26 with * g * being the gravitational field vector and @xmath27 representing the gas pressure tensor .",
    "the electromagnetic term in the fluid equation of motion is associated with the assumption that a magnetic field permeates the plasma .",
    "however , we have neglected forces associated with any electric fields , for reasons detailed above .    since , a priori , we have no knowledge of the current density within a given fluid , we replace the current density within equation  ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) using equation  ( [ eq : amp ] ) .",
    "the equation of motion may now be written as @xmath28 with the aid of a vector operation identity and knowing that the magnetic field is divergenceless , this may again be rewritten as @xmath29 immediately , we recognize that the electromagnetic contributions on the right - hand side are the familiar magnetic tension and pressure terms , respectively .",
    "however , the final form of the equation of motion requires one further step .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand side may be expressed as the divergence of a magnetic stress tensor @xcite , let us call it @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 with @xmath32 representing the identity tensor .",
    "this definition then implies , @xmath33 the magnetic stress tensor introduced above can be thought of an anisotropic pressure tensor , where the pressures it describes are intrinsic properties of the magnetic field .",
    "stars , however , are considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this implies the absence of bulk fluid motion , forcing the left - hand side of the equation of motion to vanish .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 which is a statement of magnetohydrostatic equilibrium .      at the most fundamental level",
    ", one - dimensional stellar evolution codes simultaneously solve a set of four coupled , first - order differential equations .",
    "they are the equation of mass conservation , hydrostatic equilibrium , energy transport , and energy conservation .",
    "qualitatively , we can easily predict how these equations will be altered by the presence of a magnetic field which may then be translated into a quantitative description .",
    "the equation of mass conservation should be unaltered by any magnetic perturbation . of course , this is assuming that mass removed by stellar winds is negligible and that transient events that may remove mass ( i.e. , flares , coronal mass ejections ) are neglected .",
    "the stated conditions hold for our approach .",
    "thus , @xmath35 where we have dropped the subscript @xmath36 on the density and assume all references to density are specifically to the mass density , unless otherwise noted .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium , as we saw earlier in equation  ( [ eq : hse ] ) , is modified through the inclusion of the magnetic pressure and tension .",
    "projecting out the radial component of the magnetic pressures , we are able to adapt the three - dimensional concept for one - dimensional models . therefore , we have @xmath37\\cdot { \\bf \\hat{r}}.\\ ] ] the precise handling of the vector magnetic field within the code will be discussed later .",
    "the final form of the energy transport equation is the same as if there were no perturbation .",
    "namely , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the local temperature gradient .",
    "magnetic perturbations to the stellar structure equations will self - consistently alter the temperature gradient through various thermodynamic considerations .",
    "of greatest importance will be the affects on the treatment of convection .",
    "the full treatment will be discussed in the next subsection .    finally , there are changes to the parameters present in the canonical equation of energy conservation in stellar evolution",
    ". modifications to these parameters arise from the treatment of the specific thermodynamic equations ( discussed in the next subsection ) and additional terms that are electromagnetic in origin .",
    "the final form of the energy conservation equation is @xmath40    aside from the first three standard terms on the right - hand side , there are two additional electromagnetic terms .",
    "first , there is a poynting flux associated with the field , @xmath41 although as discussed above , we assume the @xmath42-field is zero everywhere .",
    "next , energy is also associated with the ohmic dissipation of electric currents brought about by the resistive nature of the plasma . @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the electric current and @xmath45 is the resistance of the medium . here , electrical currents are converted to heat that then is transmitted to the surrounding plasma .",
    "since we have assumed an infinitely conducting plasma , this energy term goes immediately to zero .",
    "the effects of a global magnetic field are introduced into the thermodynamic framework supplied by dsep following the approach outlined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ls95 ) .",
    "providing a detailed , step - by - step guide of the magnetic perturbation to the various thermodynamic quantities would prove tedious .",
    "therefore , we refer the reader to ls95 for a full derivation of each equation presented below .",
    "our aim in this subsection is to adequately summarize the pertinent aspects of ls95 and highlight where we diverge from their original approach .    at the core of the ls95 method is the specification of a new thermodynamic state variable , @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 the state variable @xmath46 is the magnetic energy per unit mass and @xmath48 is the magnetic field strength at radius @xmath49 . unlike ls95 , our definition of @xmath46 depends on the radial distribution of the magnetic field strength and also on the density of the stellar plasma .",
    "originally , ls95 favored a mass - depth - dependent function , @xmath50 . however , we moved away from this prescription when we realized several thermodynamic derivatives became divergent .",
    "once the magnetic field strength is specified throughout the star , it is straightforward to calculate @xmath46 at each point within the model .",
    "the energy associated with the magnetic field arises due to forces exerted by the magnetic field on the plasma .",
    "these forces are represented by the anisotropic pressure tensor present in equation  ( [ eq : eom ] ) . as a first approximation",
    ", we convert the pressure tensor to a scalar pressure by taking the trace of the pressure tensor to yield the mean magnetic pressure , @xmath51 since we are not solving the full set of mhd equations , we look , instead , to set approximate upper and lower limits on the scalar pressure . assuming a cartesian coordinate system , if we imagine the magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath52-axis , or for a star , the rotational axis , then we may expand the pressure tensor to read @xmath53.\\ ] ] note that there is an isotropic magnetic pressure associated with each diagonal element along with the additional magnetic tension term in the final element .",
    "since tension is directed along the field line , the tension exists in the @xmath52-direction only , in this instance . taking the trace ,",
    "we find @xmath54    the above equation is satisfied for a magnetic field where a strong tension component is present .",
    "however , if we assume that there is no tension at all , then , following the same procedure , @xmath55 we can now limit the strength of the scalar magnetic pressure within the one - dimensional framework . specifically , @xmath56 defining a `` geometry parameter , '' akin to ls95 , allows us to emulate the effects of having a strongly curved field or a field with no curvature , and varying degrees between the two extremes . this geometry parameter is defined such that we recover the average magnetic pressure for each case above , @xmath57 where @xmath58 in both cases , the appropriate expression for the scalar magnetic pressure is returned . with the magnetic energy density and pressure formulated as scalars",
    ", we have successfully converted the inherently three - dimensional magnetic field into a one - dimensional magnetic perturbation . in the process",
    ", we have also reproduced the scalar parameters originally presented by ls95 .",
    "the derivations that follow hereafter in sections  [ sec : eos ] and [ sec : mlt ] are provided as a review of the ls95 method to enable transparency and enhance the clarity of discussions concerning the application of our models .",
    "original , complete derivations are to be found in ls95 .",
    "we do , however , deviate from their paper in equation  ( [ eq : longest ] ) , where it is stated explicitly below .",
    "we have just seen that magnetic fields exert forces on the plasma and , thus , carry an associated pressure , tension , and energy .",
    "the introduction of these terms into the equations of stellar structure then necessitates the inclusion of these parameters in the eos of the system .",
    "again , we will mention only the most important modifications , deferring to ls95 for a rigorous treatment . beginning with the first law of thermodynamics ,",
    "@xmath59 we recognize that each term contains , now , both the standard gas and radiation terms as well as a new magnetic contribution , @xmath60 in the above equation , the magnetic perturbation rightly does not contribute any work .",
    "however , in order to write the equation as a function of the total pressure , we may subtract off the magnetic contribution , @xmath61 where we take the volume to be the specific volume , @xmath62 .",
    "hereafter , it is also assumed that any unsubscripted quantity refers to the total quantity while gas and radiation are lumped under the subscript 0 ( zero ) convention and magnetic variables carry a subscript @xmath46 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : firstlaw ] ) is the new `` non - standard '' first law of thermodynamics and suggests that @xmath63 and @xmath64 following the derivation by ls95 , explicitly writing out the other state variables illustrates the effects of adding the magnetic perturbation .",
    "ignoring constants for clarity and ease , @xmath65/\\left[t + ( \\gamma - 1)\\chi\\right ] \\\\ u & = & \\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{t^4}{\\rho } + \\chi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are all subject to the eos , @xmath66 the coefficients in the eos above are defined as follows , @xmath67 and will be referred to , as such , throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "note , that @xmath0 carries no subscript and should not be confused with the convective mixing - length parameter , @xmath6 .",
    "an immediate consequence of altering the thermodynamic variables is the effect on the specific heats , @xmath68{\\left(\\frac{d v}{d t}\\right)_{p,\\chi } } \\\\ c_v & = & { \\left(\\frac{d q}{d t}\\right)_{v,\\chi } } = { \\left(\\frac{d u}{d t}\\right)_{v,\\chi}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are related to one another via the relation , @xmath69 the difference in specific heats is written just as it would be without any magnetic perturbation , however , each term is self - consistently modified by the presence of a magnetic perturbation .    the change in heat as a result of the magnetic perturbation follows and is found to be @xmath70 although , the addition of the purely magnetic term , @xmath71 , as a result of the perturbation should not be included .",
    "the reasoning for this is simple .",
    "if we assume that magnetic phenomena are generated through the dynamo action , then we inference that rotational energy is the source for the energy converted to the pure magnetic term .",
    "since our models do not account for rotation , we discard the final term in the above equation .",
    "thus , the change in heat to be considered in the stellar luminosity equation is @xmath72 ls95 were quick to point out , that at the instant of any magnetic perturbation , the change in heat due to magnetic effects should be exactly zero .",
    "finally , from the observed change in heat comes the definition of the adiabatic gradient .",
    "adiabaticity requires constant entropy , and therefore no heat exchange , meaning @xmath73 as it is in the non - magnetic case .",
    "again , only in appearance ; the actual variables are altered by the introduction of a magnetic perturbation .",
    "convection is determined to occur in regions where a given fluid parcel is unstable to a small displacement in the radial direction .",
    "the primary method of determining convective stability is to analyze the density of a generalized fluid parcel .",
    "parcels that are less dense than their surroundings will travel radially outward until they reach a height within the star at which the surrounding fluid has the same density as the parcel .    upon reaching this point ,",
    "the fluid parcel is assumed to fully mix with its surroundings becoming indistinguishable from the rest of the fluid .",
    "conversely , if a fluid element is more dense than surrounding fluid , it will sink down to a greater depth in the star , following the same trend as a rising convective element . in either case ,",
    "gravity is the restoring force .",
    "one assumption is that the fluid parcel is considered to always be in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings .",
    "the distance over which a fluid parcel travels before mixing is the well - known `` mixing - length . ''",
    "mixing - length theory ( mlt ) has been well established as a local means of prescribing convection for a one - dimensional stellar evolution code @xcite . at locations where various differences in prescriptions of mlt occur",
    ", we will specify our assumptions .",
    "stability of a fluid parcel is determined by comparing the density of the element to that of the surroundings @xmath74\\delta r\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote quantities of the fluid element under consideration and the surroundings , respectively . to ensure stability",
    ", we require @xmath77 , meaning , the element is stable to small radial displacements , @xmath78 as the fluid parcel is displaced radially , ls95 reminds us that we must consider how @xmath46 of the parcel reacts . if the initial @xmath46 of the parcel does not change as the element is displaced , @xmath79 conversely , if @xmath46 of the element is always equal to that of the surrounding material , there must be a flux of @xmath46 as the element is displaced , @xmath80 it is therefore advantageous to relate the spatial gradient of magnetic energy density of the parcel to that of the surroundings by introducing a free parameter , @xmath81 , such that @xmath82 where @xmath81 varies between 0 and 1 .",
    "later , we will attempt to eliminate this free variable and set it to a physically realistic value .    expanding the density differentials introduced in equation  ( [ eq : ddiff ] ) and multiplying through by the pressure scale height , as opposed to the temperature scale height since we assume pressure equilibrium between the fluid parcel and its surroundings . ]",
    "casts the stability criterion according to known differentials , @xmath83 where we made use of a series gradient definitions , @xmath84 here , we have defined the temperature gradient of the surrounding plasma , temperature gradient fluid element in question , and the magnetic energy density gradient , respectively .",
    "the magnetic energy density gradient turns out to affect the final form of the temperature gradient of the fluid parcel .",
    "in particular , the relation between the gradient of the parcel and that of the surrounding fluid , given by equation  ( [ eq : magflux ] ) .",
    "if @xmath85 , then we find that complete adiabaticity holds , meaning @xmath86 .",
    "however , for the case that @xmath87 , any heat transferred away from the parcel will be in the form of magnetic energy ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus , from equation  ( [ eq : heat ] ) , @xmath89 which may be rearranged to read @xmath90    substituting this expression for the parcel s temperature gradient back into equation  ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) , we derive the condition that must be met if a fluid parcel is to be stable against convection , @xmath91 with a modified stability criterion in hand , ls95 the proceed to derive a set of five equations that allow for a solution to the temperature gradient , @xmath92 . the equations are developed through a detailed consideration of the various energy fluxes through the system in their sections 5.1  5.3 .",

    "our models predict temperatures that are 250  k ( 4% ) and 430  k ( 8% ) hotter than the observations for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "the noticeable temperature disagreements in both stars may be the result of two possible effects .",
    "on the one hand , we might assume that the age predicted from the @xmath10@xmath45 plane is correct and that there only exists a discrepancy with the effective temperatures .",
    "this implies that either the effective temperature from the models or the observations is incorrect .",
    "however , since the stars are quite similar to the sun , it is more likely the case that our standard models underpredict the radius of the primary as well , driving up the model - derived effective temperature .",
    "this particular scenario is supported by @xcite who found both components display obvious ca ii emission that is likely the result of each star having a magnetically heated chromosphere .    the age inferred from the @xmath10@xmath45 diagram",
    "would then be older than the true age of the system .",
    "unfortunately , this scenario further complicates the situation regarding ef  aqr  b. if the age of the system is younger than inferred from standard models of the primary , then the radius discrepancy for the secondary becomes larger than originally quoted .      following the results discussed above ,",
    "magnetic models were computed for both ef  aqr components using a scaled - solar heavy element composition .",
    "several models with a mass of 1.24  @xmath15 were generated with various surface magnetic field strengths .",
    "we then found the model with the weakest field strength required to produce the observed radius and @xmath4 of ef  aqr  a. with @xmath158 , we had to prescribe a photospheric magnetic field strength of 1.6  kg , while with @xmath159 , a more intense 2.6  kg field was necessary .",
    "the magnetic model tracks are displayed in figures  [ fig : mag](a ) and ( b ) as blue dashed lines .",
    "the magnetic models of the primary suggest a younger age of @xmath160  gyr for the ef  aqr system , as opposed to the 2.0  gyr age determined from standard models .",
    "this younger age is consistent with the @xmath161  gyr age derived for the primary by @xcite after fine - tuning the mixing length .",
    "we next had to select a magnetic field strength that would allow a 0.95  @xmath15 model to have a radius and @xmath4 compatible with ef aqr b at 1.3  gyr , if finding that unique combination was possible . surface magnetic field strengths of 3.2  kg and 5.5  kg were able to produce the required stellar parameters , with @xmath153  =  2 and 4/3 , respectively , at an age of 1.35  gyr . in both cases ,",
    "the models were able to reproduce the stellar radius and @xmath4 within the quoted @xmath162 uncertainties .",

    "structurally , the addition of a magnetic perturbation within the models reduces the radial extent of the surface convection zone . for both stars in ef aqr",
    ", we find the magnetic models that are sufficient to correct the observed discrepancies have surface convection zones that are 4% smaller than those in the standard models , at the same age .",
    "the reduction of the surface convection zone can be attributed to the modified stability criterion as well as modified convective velocities . while only speculation , we attribute the equality of the percent reduction of convection zone sizes to coincidence .",
    "the implementation of a magnetic perturbation within stellar evolution models is quite capable of reconciling predicted model fundamental stellar properties with those determined observationally , at least for ef  aqr .",
    "while it seems plausible that magnetic fields may suppress thermal convection inside solar - type stars , how are we to be sure that magnetic fields may be reasonably invoked for this particular system ? even if invoking magnetic fields is rational , are the field strengths required by the models realistic ?    addressing the first question , we showed in section  [ sec : intro ] that naturally inefficient convection , as described by the @xcite calibration , was unable to account for the small values of @xmath7 required to mitigate the observed model - observation disagreements .",
    "but , the inability of naturally inefficient convection to provide a solution does not positively identify magnetic fields as the root cause . however , there is additional evidence that invoking magnetic fields is reasonable .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of the ca ii h and k lines for both stars in ef aqr reveals incredibly strong emission cores superposed on the absorption troughs @xcite .",
    "a search of the _ rosat _ bright source catalogue @xcite also shows that ef  aqr is a strong x - ray emitter .",
    "coupling these observations with high projected rotational velocities extracted from line broadening measurements , suggests that there is the potential for a strong dynamo mechanism to be operating .",
    "this evidence is only circumstantial , but does provide tantalizing clues .    for the sake of argument , let us assume that the stars are significantly magnetically active .",
    "it would then be worthwhile to compare the strength of the magnetic field for each ef  aqr component to those values required by the models .",
    "unfortunately , no direct magnetic field strength estimates of ef  aqr are available , forcing us to base our analysis on indirect magnetic field strength estimates .    a natural first step would be to compare the ef  aqr components to other known solar - type stars , such as the sun and @xmath0 cen a and b ( see table  [ tab : mag ] ) .",
    "the sun s mean photospheric magnetic field strength is between 0.1 g and 1 g @xcite with local patches of very intense fields ( i.e. , sunspots ) with strengths on the order of 23 kg @xcite .",
    "similarly , the average longitudinal field strength of @xmath0 cen a was determined to be less than 0.2  g , after a null detection of a stokes @xmath163 polarization signature @xcite .",
    "the field strengths required by the models of the ef  aqr components therefore suggest that the stars are pervaded by magnetic fields that typically characterize the intense regions of sunspots .",
    "this at first appears detrimental to the validity of the models .",
    "however , studies of the active and quiet sun , particularly sunspot regions , has led to multiple scaling relations allowing for an indirect determination of stellar photospheric magnetic field strengths .",
    "one of these scaling relations was observed to exist between the x - ray luminosity of an active region and its total unsigned magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "the two observables were found to exhibit a power - law relation , @xmath164 where the power - law index , @xmath165 , was determined to be 1.19@xmath20.04 by @xcite .",
    "the index was later revised by @xcite using a more diverse data set , including both solar and extrasolar sources .",
    "their revised analysis decreased the index to @xmath166 .",
    "the magnetic flux is defined in the usual manner ( equation  ( [ eq : bflux ] ) ) , @xmath167 with @xmath168 represents the vertical magnetic field strength .",
    "therefore , if we are able to determine the x - ray luminosity of the ef  aqr components , it is possible to place a lower limit on the magnetic field strength at the surface of the two components .",
    "the system has a confirmed x - ray counter - part in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey bright source catalogue @xcite .",
    "the x - ray count rate was converted to an x - ray flux according to the formula derived by @xcite , @xmath169 where hr is the x - ray hardness ratio , @xmath170 is the x - ray count rate , and @xmath171 is the x - ray flux . finally , the x - ray flux was converted to a luminosity using the 172  pc distance quoted by @xcite .",
    "the count rate measured by _ rosat _ was 0.0655@xmath20.0154 counts s@xmath172 with a hardness ratio of 0.32@xmath20.22 .",

    "given the similarity of the two stars in ef aqr , the precise weighting does not affect the results .",
    "if both stars contribute equally to the total x - ray flux , then at a distance of 172  pc , the x - ray luminosity of each component is @xmath176  =  @xmath177 erg  s@xmath172 .",

    "the x - ray luminosity of a typical solar active region is on the order of @xmath182 erg  s@xmath172 @xcite .",

    "similarly , @xcite monitored the x - ray luminosity of @xmath0 cen and found the primary had an x - ray luminosity around half that of the sun ( approximately @xmath182 erg s@xmath172 ) and the secondary had about twice the x - ray luminosity of the sun ( about @xmath183 erg s@xmath172 ) .",
    "further estimates for the x - ray luminosity of @xmath0 cen a and b comes from _ rosat _ , which yields luminosities between @xmath182 erg s@xmath172 and @xmath183 erg s@xmath172 for each component , consistent with ayers analysis .",
    "table  [ tab : mag ] provides a comparison of how these quantities translate to magnetic field strengths .",
    "comparisons with the sun and @xmath0 cen show that each component in ef aqr has an x - ray luminosity 23 orders of magnitude greater than `` typical '' g and early - k stars .",
    "again , while not indicative of causation , the correlation between high levels of x - ray emission and magnetic activity strongly suggests that ef aqr is incredibly active . given this information , our initial assumption that the stars are active seems valid .",
    "therefore , the implementation of a magnetic perturbation in stellar models of this system appears warranted .    the amount of vertical magnetic flux near the surface of each star",
    "may then be found using the @xcite scaling relation .",

    "a magnetic field strength involves dividing the unsigned magnetic flux by the total area through which the field is penetrating . for our purposes ,",

    "therefore , we find the vertical magnetic field strength for the primary and secondary of ef  aqr to be 1.3  kg and 2.5  kg , regardless of the adopted flux weighting , respectively .",
    "note , this is the vertical magnetic field strength and sets a lower limit to the total magnetic field strength .",

    "further estimates of the magnetic field strengths may be found by applying a scaling relation using the ca ii k line core emission @xcite .",
    "the scaling relation was developed by correlating ca ii k line core emission and the magnetic flux density of solar active regions and their surroundings .",
    "the relation between the two was found to be @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the intensity of the emission line core , @xmath187 is the intensity of the line wing . while the relation was derived for small , local active regions , @xcite suggest that there is no reason to believe that the relation would not hold for hemispherical averages of solar - type stars .",
    "using the spectra provided by @xcite for the ca  ii k core emission lines from each ef  aqr component , we were able to estimate the magnetic field strength of each component .",
    "spectra for the primary indicate that the average magnetic field strength , @xmath188 , is equal to 830  g. similarly , for ef  aqr  b , @xmath188  =  3.3  kg .",
    "the values quoted above are derived from rough approximations of the core and wing intensities .",
    "however , we do not foresee the values of @xmath188 changing radically with more precise line intensity measurements .",
    "we do caution that the results for ef aqr b require an extrapolation of the ca ii relation and the data for ef aqr a place it near the edge of the derived relation where only a few data points exist .",
    "based on the scaling relations for x - ray emission and ca  ii  k line core emission , the magnetic field strength for the primary and secondary is seen to be approximately 1  kg and 3  kg , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field strengths required by the models are therefore within a factor of two of the predicted field strengths , regardless of the adopted @xmath153 value .",

    "while the indirect estimates provided by x - ray emission and ca ii k emission are encouraging , confirmation of these results using high resolution zeeman spectroscopy , spectropolarimetry , or zeeman  doppler imaging ( zdi ) is preferred .",
    "unfortunately , these observations are difficult for fast rotators , such as those that comprise most deb systems .",
    "they are also difficult for distant systems , where the short integration time required by zdi inhibits the ability of acquiring measurements with sufficient signal - to - noise ( see the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once a magnetic field is detected , there exists the question of whether the observed strength is indicative of the total magnetic field strength .",
    "field strengths derived for stars with spectral - type k and m using stokes @xmath163 observations appear to yield only around 10% of the total magnetic field strength compared to observations in stokes @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that regions of opposite polarity tend to cancel out in stokes @xmath163 , making it most sensitive to the large - scale component , not the small - scale fields thought to pervade low - mass stars . how to accurately account for this when testing the models",
    "is not fully clear and will require investigation . as more stars across all spectral types",
    "are observed in both stokes @xmath163 and @xmath44 , a more coherent picture is sure to develop .",
    "magnetic models may also be useful for transiting exoplanet surveys , particularly those focused on m - dwarfs ( e.g. , mearth transit survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the largest uncertainties in deriving the properties of a transiting planet is the radius of the host star .",
    "the lack of reliability involved in predicting low - mass stellar radii from evolution models has deterred the use of models as predictors of exoplanet host - star radii @xcite .",
    "shoring up these deficiencies may lead to more accurate predictions of host star radii from stellar models , circumventing , for a time , the need for lengthy and costly observations .",
    "this would be most useful in identifying interesting follow - up targets by providing a better estimate of the habitable zone @xcite .",
    "there are certainly caveats with models , as other large uncertainties exist in predicting the properties of a single star from stellar evolution mass tracks @xcite",
    ". however , work is being performed to alleviate some of these uncertainties by calibrating models to asteroseismic data @xcite .",
    "low - mass stars are also less sensitive to the input parameters of stellar models than their solar - type counterparts , reducing the associated uncertainties .",
    "stellar evolution models may therefore provide a fast and reliable estimate of the host star properties , depending on the required level of precision .",
    "since most m - dwarfs being surveyed are nearby , there is a good chance that they may have an x - ray counterpart in either the bright source or faint source catalogue from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey @xcite . as was demonstrated in section  [ sec : field_strength ] , magnetic field strengths required by the models are within about a factor of two ( or better , if @xmath191 is adopted ) of those predicted by the x - ray scaling relation of @xcite .",
    "this will allow an intelligent choice of the magnetic field strength used as an input for the models , thus producing more reliable results from stellar models .",
    "all told , the introduction of a self - consistent set of magnetic stellar evolution models provides the potential for models to be used with greater reliability in a wide range of applications .",
    "there still exist several challenges that require attention @xcite , but this is a first step in addressing key issues that have been raised in the past two decades .",
    "the authors express gratitude to l.  hebb and o.  kochukhov for helpful discussions .",
    "thanks the william h. neukom 1964 institute for computational science for their generous support and the department of physics and astronomy at uppsala university for their gracious hospitality . g.a.f . and b.c .",
