    "photometry from space is currently the most sensitive method to detect small - size planets with orbital periods less than a year .",

    "although it was possible for the three examples cited above , measuring the mass of such small planets is in general difficult , requiring spectrographs of extreme radial - velocity precision .",
    "when the parent star is faint , as often for transiting systems , this mass characterization goes beyond the detection threshold . in such cases , one has to rely on alternative solutions to establish the transiting body as a planet .",
    "one is the detection of transit timing variations when several planets orbit the same star , as used for the kepler-9 @xcite and kepler-11 @xcite multiple systems . but this requires specific configurations that will not occur evenly in all systems .",
    "the next alternative is to examine and reject all other possible scenarios , with the aid eventually of additional observational constraints and intensive simulations .",
    "the @xmath8 candidates @xcite are in majority neptune - like or super - earths , orbit stars generally fainter than v=14 with periods up to several months .",
    "there is only a small part of these for which high - precision radial - velocity measurements will allow the mass characterization .",
    "undiluted binaries are easily rejected , but all configurations involving three bodies are more difficult to exclude .",
    "the @xmath8 team is making use of the blender analysis tool ( e.g. , @xcite ) for some of individual candidates , by including a comparison of data with models .",
    "the outputs are the relative probability that a given system corresponds to a transiting planet or to a variety of other eclipsing system configurations . in the case of systems where hypothesis priors dominate , a statistical analysis not involving the data is also used with success @xcite . a mixture of both approaches ( simplified data / model comparison and extended hypothesis priors from a model of the galaxy ) has also been provided for all @xmath8 candidates by @xcite , giving an homogeneous look at the candidate validation process .",
    "the observational constraints that are to be used in such cases are : the light curve and transit shape , the centroid time series ( for @xmath8 only ) , the high - resolution ground - based images of the star s vicinity , the radial - velocity ( rv ) times series , and the bisector - rv dependency .    in this paper , we present one such system discovered by corot @xcite .",

    "final odds ratios range between 1400 and 10@xmath147 in favor of the planet scenario .",
    "the most likely scenario after the planetary system is a beb , at least 1400 times less probable .",
    "we conclude that , based on current data and prior knowledge ,  b is validated as a planet with a very high degree of confidence .",
    "in this paper , we report the discovery of a transiting planetary system , .",
    "the mass of the planet could not be measured through doppler measurements . with the decreasing size of transiting candidates , and the faintness of their parent stars ,",
    "as provided by the photometric space missions  and @xmath8 , such situations have been increasingly common .",
    "most transiting candidates will have to be identified with additional means than the detection of the keplerian motion , as already stated by , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the full bayesian analysis of the available data and models has been applied to  b using pastis @xcite .",
    "this analysis has allowed quantifying the odds ratio between the planet scenarios and other false positive configurations , including hypothesis priors ; it is larger than 1000 , in strong support of the planet scenario .",
    "while some scenarios are rejected by the data , others are unfavored by hypothesis priors , and the consistent combination of these factors finally excludes false positive scenarios with a high level of confidence .",
    "more precisely , the role of 1 ) sed analyses ( exclude pib and triple ) , 2 ) adaptive optics imaging ( combined with hypothesis priors , excludes beb and btp ) , and 3 ) radial velocity measurements ( exclude undiluted binary , and constrain all other scenarios ) has been major .",
    "the colored information of  offered little additional constraints for the resolution of the system and does not exclude one in particular .",
    "interestingly ,  b lies in the  radius valley  of the distribution of planetary radii ( as known in may 2014 ) .",
    "this valley corresponds to a gap in the 4 - 8 r@xmath5 range in the @xmath8 sample @xcite , although the detection is 98% complete in the radius - period bin corresponding to  b @xcite .",
    "most of the objects that @xmath8 has detected are smaller than 3 earth radii .",
    "the period of  b , however , coincides with the peak period for transiting planets of less than 0.5 jupiter radius ; it is not an exotic object regarding its orbital distance , with respect with the population of planets known today .    in the family of planets confirmed or validated from the  mission ,",
    "b is the second smallest in size , after corot-7 b. there are @xmath20 20 additional candidates in this size range or smaller , that await further observations and analyses ( deleuil et al , in prep ) . for some of them , however , the magnitude of the star will prevent a scenario validation , because follow - up observations were not possible with current instrumentation , too time consuming , or not conclusive .",
    "in particular , adaptive optics imaging , that turned out to be critical in validating  b , is available , or gives strong enough constraints , for a subset of these candidates @xcite .",
    "also , even if radial - velocity observations were conducted on all promising candidates , and rejected grazing binaries in most cases ( except fast rotators and hot stars ) , they usually give weak upper limits on the companion mass .",
    "observed constraints differ from case to case , and only in a few cases are they significant enough to discard all false positives with strong confidence .",
    "pastis analyses will thus provide validation for only a handful of them ( daz et al , in prep ) .",
    "table  [ starplanet_param_table ] finally summarizes the parameters of the system .",
    "the radius of the candidate planet is 4.88@xmath4 r@xmath5 , while its mass is less than 49 m@xmath5 at 3-@xmath17 .",
    "this gives a density that is either compatible with the one of the solar system gas giant planets , or , at maximum , between the density of neptune and mars .",
    "this parameter , and thus , the nature of the planet , is thus only loosely constrained .",
    "the planetary equilibrium temperature is @xmath20900k .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows how  b compares with other known transiting planets . in this radius range ,",
    "other characterized planets tend to have a mass in the higher range of possible values for  b. these other planets in the radius range of  b either show ttvs ( kepler-11 and 18 systems ) or have parent stars 4 magnitude brighter ( hat - p-11 ) , which eases the rv observations . in order to derive the mass of  b in the future , intensive rv campaigns with keck - hires and/or harps",
    "should be devoted , with a couple of measurements per night for one or two months .",
    "the future instrument vlt - espresso should also more easily detect the keplerian motion of a few   due to such planets , thanks to a larger collecting area and exquisite rv precision .",
    "modeling the internal structure of a giant planet without real mass constraint can not be properly done .",
    "in addition , the radius of  b is close to the radius of kepler-87 c and corot-8 b , which have masses differing by a factor 10 .",
    "maybe the slightly enhanced metallicity of  ( [ fe / h]=0.17 ) will direct the solution towards a large core mass , but only further rv observations will be able to settle to mean planet density , in a domain where very few planets are yet fully characterized . in the future , tess and plato missions will help discovering more planets in this radius / period range , and the ground - based complementary observations of the candidates will allow to get their mass with great accuracy , since the target stars will be much brighter than  typical targets . the underlying physics of this diversity in bulk densities will then be better understood .",
