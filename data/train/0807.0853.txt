    "stimulated by the recent progress in radiation of terahertz ( thz ) electromagnetic waves using a mesa of @xmath3 ( bscco ) single crystal @xcite , we investigated the dynamics of superconductivity phase of the intrinsic josephson junctions with strong inductive couplings .",
    "a new dynamics state was found in the absence of an external magnetic field , in which the gauge invariant phase difference in each junction is characterized by static @xmath4 phase kinks stacked periodically along the @xmath1 axis , in addition to a phase term evolving linearly with time according to the ac josephson relation and the plasma term @xcite .",
    "the phase kink permits pumping large dc energy into the plasma oscillation via the ac josephson effect , and enhances strong radiations of thz electromagnetic waves .",
    "this state is the only one known so far which counts for the following important features of the coherent radiations observed in refs .",

    "this solution corresponds to the ( 1,0 ) cavity mode . in the present work ,",
    "we show that the kink state can be extended to 3d , where the phase kink runs in the @xmath5 planes , and the solution is labeled by the ( 1,1 ) cavity mode",
    ". the kink state can also exist in samples of the cylinder geometry .",
    "we first derive a set of equations for the shape of the phase kink , the amplitude and phase shift of plasma oscillation .",
    "an approximate solution can be obtained easily in the strong inductive - coupling limit where the phase kink renders a step function .",
    "this formalism releases one from a full computer simulation , and can be extended from 2d to 3d straightforwardly .",

    "there are three factors in determining the poynting vector : the maximal plasma amplitude , the factor for the electromagnetic field at the edge , and the cavity frequency . in cylinders",
    "the electromagnetic fields are isotropic azimuthally , and can make a full use of the phase kink in pumping dc energy into plasma oscillations , which results in a large plasma amplitude .",
    "the ( 1,1 ) mode in the rectangular mesa is also better than the ( 1,0 ) mode since the former can use a 2d phase kink .",
    "while the electric field is maximal at the edges of the rectangular mesa , the edge electric field for the cylinder geometry is only @xmath121 percent of its maximum taken at the center of the cylinder .",
    "this suppresses the radiation power as in eq .",
    "( [ poyntingcylinder ] ) .",
    "the cavity frequency in the cylindrical geometry is superior to the rectangular geometry by a factor @xmath2 for the same linear system size .",
    "while the cylinder geometry exhibits a large density of power emission at the sample surface , the energy is radiated uniformly in the azimuthal direction . in applications one needs to focus to a small angle .",
    "in contrast , the directivity of the radiation from a rectangular mesa is helpful for gathering energy efficiently .    as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) and the counterparts for the other modes , the plasma amplitude at the cavity resonance does not depend on the system size .",
    "therefore , we can increase the radiation energy by adopting smaller samples with larger cavity frequency according to eqs .",
    "( [ poynting])-([poyntingcylinder ] ) .",
    "in the present paper , only the fundamental frequency is kept for the plasma contribution to the total phase difference .",
    "this treatment is justified when the system is off resonance , where the amplitude of plasma oscillation is small and higher harmonics can be neglected safely .",
    "we have checked the validity of this treatment at the cavity resonance for the cavity mode ( 1,0 ) of the rectangular mesa by comparing the estimates thus obtained with those by accurate simulations which include automatically all orders of higher harmonics @xcite .",
    "we expect that this approximation also provides reasonable estimates for the ( 1,1 ) cavity modes of the rectangular mesa and for the cylinder geometry .    in the resonating regime , the plasma part",
    "is much enhanced , and higher harmonics appear @xcite .",
    "the number of equations governing the kink state is 2@xmath122 + 2 when up to the @xmath122-th harmonics are covered .",
    "here we provide equations merely including the fundamental frequency with @xmath123 .",
    "while the formulas can be extended easily to higher harmonics , the resultant equations are much more complex , and take heavy numerics to solve .",
    "discussions on this point will be reported elsewhere @xcite .    in the kink solution ,",
    "the spatial part of the plasma term is the eigen function of the laplace operator in the respective geometry with zero ( or in presence of radiation very small ) normal derivative at the edge , proportional to the magnetic field . in the cylinder geometry",
    ", it gives a cavity frequency @xmath124 with @xmath79 the radius of cylinder and @xmath125 the first zero of @xmath82 .",
    "for a state presuming zero ( or very small ) electric field at the boundary , the typical frequency should be @xmath126 , where @xmath89 is the first zero of @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , detecting the size dependence of the cavity frequency in the cylinder geometry can tell directly what state is realized inside the system . since a rectangular mesa will give cavity frequency of @xmath127 for both of the two cases , the cylinder geometry is unique in determining the state realized in the junctions and thus the mechanism of the strong radiation observed recently in experiments .",
    "the present analysis reveals the way how the stack of josephson junctions convert the dc energy to ac electromagnetic radiation , by formulating out explicitly the oscillation amplitude and the frequency .",
    "the far - field radiation pattern is determined merely by the spatial part of the plasma term , and is the same as a thin capacitor subject to an ac driving voltage .",
    "analyses on far - field radiation patterns for various modes are available in literature @xcite , and the results can be compared with those observed for the thz radiations from mesas of bscco single crystal . a detailed discussion will also be given in ref",
    ".  @xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "we have worked out explicitly the kink state in josephson junctions of strong inductive coupling in 3d for both rectangular and cylindrical geometries .",
    "a set of equations are provided which permits one to understand the new state without heavy numerics .",
    "iv characteristics are revealed to be very nonlinear due to the cavity resonance where the plasma oscillation is much enhanced .",
    "the solution for a cylindrical mesa provides a higher resonating frequency than that of a square mesa with the same linear size by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "investigation on the size dependence of the resonating frequency in the cylinder geometry can give a direct evidence for the state realized in the stack of josephson junctions , and thus can reveal the mechanism of the strong radiation discovered recently .",
