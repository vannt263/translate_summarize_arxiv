    "the structure and evolution of neutron stars depends on the properties of matter at nuclear and supranuclear densities .",
    "such conditions are not achievable in terrestrial laboratories and the theoretical description of such superdense matter remains uncertain .",
    "it has therefore been hoped that neutron stars , and in particular those that are isolated and not complicated by strong accretion or magnetospheric signatures , might provide some empirical insights : observations of their masses , radii and cooling characteristics could , in principle , provide useful constraints for the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter ( e.g.  lattimer & prakash 2001 and references therein )",
    ".    in a relatively brief period of @xmath8-@xmath9  yr , a hot , isolated neutron star ( ins ) born in a supernova explosion can cool , cease pulsar activity and become essentially inactive ( see , e.g. , the review of treves et al .",

    "isolated neutron stars thought to inhabit the galaxy , only a tiny fraction are therefore expected to be sufficiently young to remain hot and visible in x - rays .",
    "one possible mechanism capable of sustaining thermal x - ray emission in an older ins is accretion of material from the ism . to date",
    ", only a handful of these older ins candidates have been found .",
    "the soft x - ray source rx  j@xmath03754  discovered by walter , wolk & neuhuser ( 1996 ) is the brightest , and probably the closest ( kaplan , van kerkwijk & anderson 2002 ) of the ins candidates .",
    "it was identified with a very faint ( @xmath12 ) optical counterpart by walter & matthews ( 1997 ) , was found to have an optical flux about a factor of 2 - 3 higher than that predicted by the rayleigh - jeans tail of the @xmath13  ev blackbody spectrum that represents the low resolution rosat pspc spectrum ( e.g.walter et al .",
    "1996 ; campana et al .",
    "1997 , pons et al .",
    "2001 ) , and lies in the line - of - sight toward the dark molecular cloud r cra .",
    "however , the exact nature of rx  j@xmath03754  remains unknown  whether it is a fairly young , cooling ins , perhaps undetected as a pulsar because of unfortunate beam alignment , or an older object reheated by ism accretion .",
    "very large telescope ( vlt ) observations have recently revealed an h@xmath14 nebula round rx  j@xmath03754  and a blackbody spectrum through the uv - optical range ( van kerkwijk & kulkarni 2001a , b ) .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) astrometry was used by walter ( 2001 ) and kaplan et al .",

    "walter ( 2001 ) argued that the proper motion points to the sco - cen ob association and an age of @xmath17  yr .",
    "however , pons et al.(2001 ) failed to detect the expected pulsation signature in rosat and asca data . modelling x - ray , euv , uv and optical spectra using the walter ( 2001 ) parallax and assuming a metal - dominated atmosphere resulted in stellar radii too small for current eos and smaller than the schwarzschild radius for a canonical @xmath18 star , leading them to conclude that the surface temperature distribution could be inhomogeneous .",
    "in contrast , the same atmospheric analysis using the larger distance of kaplan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) would yield a radius consistent with current theory .",
    "if the atmosphere is indeed metal - dominated , then line and edge features should be visible in high resolution x - ray spectra .",
    "rx  j@xmath03754  was observed in 2000 march for 55ks by the chandra x - ray observatory low energy transmission grating ( letg ) and the high resolution camera spectroscopic microchannel plate detector array ( hrc - s ) to look for spectral features and pulsar activity . within relatively large statistical uncertainties ,",
    "burwitz et al .  (",
    "2001 ) failed to detect either significant departures from a blackbody spectrum or pulsations in these data .",
    "the prospect of important scientific gains from a longer observation prompted , at the request of different researchers , the undertaking of a very recent set of chandra observations of rx  j@xmath03754  under director s discretionary time using letg+hrc - s .",
    "a period search using these data by ransom , gaensler & slane ( 2002 ) has already placed an upper limit on a pulse fraction of 4.5% .",
    "presents spectroscopic and independent timing analyses of these data .",
    "the observations analysed in this paper pipeline - processed ( cxc software version 6.3.1 ) photon event lists were reduced and analysed using the ciao software package version 2.2 , and independently using custom idl software .",
    "processing included extra pulse - height filtering to reduce background ( wargelin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and barycentric correction of event times .",
    "dispersed photon events were extracted using the now standard `` bow tie '' window , and a small circular region ( 31-pixel radius% , which combines with an average deadtime of 0.59%  to yield a correction factor for a @xmath19 steradian aperture of 1.09 . ] ) was used to extract the 0th order events .",
    "we note that an extraneous bright feature ( likely a ghost image of a bright off - axis source ) appeared on the + 1 order outer hrc - s plate which introduces spurious features into the extracted spectrum and background near 110  .",
    "we applied corrections to extracted event times to ameliorate an hrc electronics problem that assigns time tags for each event to the event that immediately follows .",
    "if every event were telemetered to the ground , correct times could be easily reassigned , but because of the high hrc background rate and a telemetry limit of 184 events / sec , only _",
    "valid _ events , which make up approximately 45% of the _ total _ events in these observations , are recorded in data received on the ground .",
    "we have reassigned the time of every valid event to the preceding valid event during ground processing ; the event times will then be correct about @xmath20 of the time .",
    "one can place an upper limit of @xmath21 on the time errors associated with this process , however , simply by excluding events with a time - shift of more than @xmath21 ; the average timing error of such events will , of course , be less than @xmath21 .",
    "however , if @xmath21 is too small , too many events get excluded to perform sensitive timing studies .",
    "we have adopted a @xmath21 of 2  ms , retaining 20% of the original counts in the corrected data set .",
    "count rates were derived for each observation segment from event lists filtered to exclude times of high background and telemetry saturation , when the telemetered valid event rate exceeded 184 count  s@xmath22 , and to exclude high pulse - height events that arise entirely from background . these rates corresponding to 0th order only are listed in table  [ t : obs ] .",
    "the count rates for the different observation segments are statistically consistent , though the 2000 march observation ( 113 ) rate of @xmath23  count  s@xmath22 lies 1.9%  and @xmath24 above the rate for the combined 2001 october series rate of @xmath25 .",
    "such deviations will be obtained by chance about 3%  of the time when the count rates do not vary ; it is thus more likely attributable to quantum efficiency ( qe ) variations in the detector on small scales .",
    "indeed , pons et al .  ( 2001 ) note two rosat hri observations obtained 3  yr apart that are consistent to 1% .",
    "the fluxes corresponding to hri and pspc count rates are higher than that obtained from our chandra data by 20%  and 30% , respectively . as remarked by burwitz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , these differences are likely attributable to absolute calibration uncertainties . we have also examined the asca sis observation described pons et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and find fluxes 30 - 40  %  lower than obtained by chandra for the 20 - 30    range , but in agreement with chandra shortward of 20  ",
    ". the euve ds count rate of pons et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is also consistent with the chandra observation within allowed uncertainties .",
    "our search for pulsations used three different techniques , none of which found any evidence for significant variability .",
    "in contrast to ransom et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we did not include a deceleration term ; this will be discussed below .",
    "we applied the bayesian method of gregory & loredo ( 1992 ) to both the time - corrected and uncorrected 0th order event lists .",
    "the method tests for variability by comparing the fits of periodic stepwise models to the data with the fit of a constant model .",
    "the odds favoring variability ( based on eqn .  5.28 of gregory & loredo 1992 , with a maximum number of steps @xmath26 = 12 and limiting angular frequencies @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 equal to 10@xmath29 and 10@xmath30 , respectively ) were found to be @xmath31 for the whole data set and @xmath32 for the data filtered on @xmath33  ms , both to be compared with an odds value of @xmath34 needed for a confident pulsation or variability detection .",
    "our second method employed an fft analysis applied to the combined 0th and 1st order events , followed by a likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) to determine limits on the pulse fraction .",
    "the fft power distribution was consistent with shot noise .",
    "for the lrt of a given period , @xmath35 , the data were binned into @xmath36 phase bins , giving @xmath37 counts in each .",
    "the source model was @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the phase of bin @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the phase of the pulse and @xmath42 is the pulse fraction .",
    "the likelihood equations were then solved for @xmath43 and the process applied to @xmath44 frequencies where the fft power exceeded a critical level in the frequency range 0.001 - 50  hz . by including also the dispersed events we improved the signal - to - noise of the result by a factor of 1.47 compared to using 0th order alone and",
    "could obtain a pulse fraction limit lower than the value of 4.5%  obtained by ransom et al.(2002 ) in their unaccelerated search . a pulse fraction upper limit ( 99%  confidence ) of 2.7%",
    "was derived applying our likelihood ratio method using all data , including the dispersed events with @xmath45  .",
    "taking only the events limited by @xmath46 ms , the pulse fraction limit is 10% .",
    "thirdly , we computed the lomb - scargle periodogram for both the time - corrected and uncorrected photon arrival time differences in the frequency range 0.01 - 1  hz for the events in obsid s 3380 3381 , 3382 and 3399 .",
    "again , no significant peaks were present .",
    "the assumption of a negligible deceleration term in our period search restricts the range of periods and dipole magnetic field strengths for which our search is valid .",
    "the coherence limit for phase slippage by 10  %  over the duration of the 2001 october observations implies that our result is valid for a magnetic field upper limit @xmath47  g for period @xmath35  s ( e.g.  shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . as noted by ransom et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , this range would exclude very young and energetic neutron stars , such as the crab and vela pulsars , though most of these younger objects are also conspicuously strong radio pulsars .",
    "all anomalous x - ray pulsars would lie within our sensitivity limit range .",
    "rx  j@xmath03754  is also most unlikely to be an extremely young object based on its modest temperature and luminosity , which are consistent with an object of age @xmath48  yr on canonical cooling curves ( e.g.  tsuruta 1997 ) .",
    "spectral analysis in the form of model parameter estimation was undertaken using the ciao / sherpa fitting engine and independently using specially - written idl software .",
    "cursory inspection of the spectrum leads immediately to the conclusion that there are no obvious features indicative of absorption lines or edges .",
    "we found that blackbody models represent the high resolution spectra well , in agreement with earlier studies .",
    "we modelled + 1 and @xmath49 orders both separately and simultaneously , and added together ; results from these different approaches were statistically indistinguishable .",
    "representative results of model fits and residuals are illustrated in figure  [ f : spectra ] .",
    "two sets of best - fit parameters were obtained from independent analyses that invoked ( 1 ) the existing first and higher order cxc calibration and ( 2 ) the same first order effective area with higher orders modified slightly to improve model fits to sources with power law spectra ( marshall et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "both sets are consistent with the results of burwitz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on the 2000 march observation alone .",
    "parameters and @xmath50 statistical uncertainties for best - fit models were : ( 1 ) @xmath51  ev ; @xmath52  @xmath5 ; x - ray luminosity @xmath53  erg  s@xmath22 , where @xmath54 is the distance in units of 100  pc ; ( 2 ) @xmath55  ev ; @xmath56  @xmath5 ; x - ray luminosity @xmath57  erg  s@xmath22 .",
    "parameters producing minima in the @xmath58 test statistic were not sensitive to the exact binning adopted , though of course the reduced @xmath58 values were : values ranged from 0.94 for data binned to a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath59 , to 1.7 for @xmath60 . the latter value is dominated by residual effective area calibration uncertainties . to investigate the effects of these uncertainties , which are estimated to be about 15%  absolutely , a first order",

    "( 2001 ; @xmath62  ev ) and pons et al .",
    "( 2002 ; @xmath63 ) .",
    "we note that a temperature of 61  ev results in an optical flux only 10%  higher than that from a 55  ev blackbody , so that the discrepency between the observed optical flux and that predicted by the hot blackbody noted by walter & matthews ( 1997 ) and pons et al .",
    "( 2002 ) remains essentially unchanged .",
    "blackbody models were found by both pons et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and burwitz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to represent observed spectra better than sophisticated model atmospheres , though a uniform temperature blackbody model was formally excluded in x - ray - euv - uv - optical modelling in the former work .",
    "however , additional cooler components were found to contribute at most only a few percent to the observed rosat pspc x - ray flux .",
    "we have ruled out the significant presence of additional thermal and non - thermal emission components by trial of models combining two blackbodies , and a blackbody component with arbitrary power laws : in both cases the additional components were completely unconstrained and resulted in no improvement in the goodness of fit .",

    "our blackbody models from methods ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) correspond formally to a radius over distance ratio ( angular size ) of @xmath66  km/100pc , where @xmath67 is the `` radiation radius '' corresponding to the true radius @xmath68 for a star of mass @xmath69 , and the quoted uncertainty represents the combined temperature determination uncertainty ( @xmath70  ev ) and the ( dominant ) absolute effective area uncertainty of the letg+hrc - s combination ( @xmath71% ) .    in all model comparisons for binning at @xmath72",
    "the residual differences between the observed counts and the best - fit model show systematic departures from normal statistical deviations ( figure  [ f : spectra ] ) .",
    "broad deviations are characterised by a general overprediction of observed counts for @xmath73    and in the region 75 - 100    which is dominated by higher order flux , underprediction by an average of @xmath74  %  for the range 25 - 38   , and deviations around the instrumental c  k edge region 40 - 44   .",
    "the latter results from a residual calibration error in the hrc - s uv / ion shield .",
    "other deviations could arise either as a result of impropriety of a blackbody model for rx  j@xmath03754 , or through calibration errors which are currently estimated to be @xmath75%  over broad spectral ranges and less over narrower ranges ( drake et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "an apparent edge at 60    and flux excess in the range 60 - 70    arises because of one of the hrc - s plate gap boundaries coincides with small residual qe differences between positive and relative negative order outer plates .    in the case of narrow line or edge features , in different combinations of spectral order , data reduction method and binning size , we identify possible structure in residuals at 26.5 , 27.6 , 34.4 , 32.4 , and 35.9 (emission like features ) , and at 28.2 , 39.1 , and 86.5   ( absorption like features ) , that might be tempting to attribute to the source .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that any are chance fluctuations at the 1% level .",
    "the issue is complicated by possible calibration uncertainties on smaller scales , believed to be at a level of about 5%  or less , that should be largely smoothed out by dither .",
    "we have also used a 60ks observation ( obsid 331 ) of pks  @xmath76304 , currently thought to be a featureless continuum in the spectral range we are concerned with here ( marshall et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , as a flat field source to aid in feature identification .",
    "this spectrum comprises about eight times the number of first order counts of the combined rx  j@xmath03754  data .",
    "moreover , we have imposed a constraint that features must appear in both positive and negative orders in the rx  j@xmath03754  spectrum .",
    "we examined deviations from the model on scales up to 3    and find only the expected normal distribution of residuals after allowing for smooth departures resulting from calibration .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test applied to deviations on different scales also revealed no evidence for significant features these scales . in summary , all significant deviations in the residuals that have been found can reasonably be explained by instrumental effects .",
    "equivalent width upper limits were derived by applying counting statistics to a convolution of the spectrum with a triangular kernel ( figure  [ f : ew ] ) .",
    "the distance of 62  pc derived by walter ( 2001 ) seems at odds with the neutral h column density , @xmath77 , of @xmath78  @xmath5 derived from the chandra spectra : measured @xmath77 values for objects at this distance based on different techniques are typically in the range @xmath79-@xmath80  @xmath5 ( e.g.fruscione et al .",
    "walter ( 2001 ) indeed remarked on this , citing reddening values @xmath81 of up to 0.1 derived by knude & hg ( 1998 ) in support of the distance .",
    "however , these reddening values show considerable scatter at low reddening and are based only on a relatively coarse attribution of spectral type to the stars considered .    we have estimated @xmath77 and the mean local neutral hydrogen number density , @xmath82 , in the line - of - sight toward rx  j@xmath03754  as a function of distance by spatial interpolation in the measurements compiled by fruscione et al .",

    "we illustrate this in figure  [ f : ism ] , together with the allowed distance ranges from walter ( 2001 ) and kaplan et al .",
    "the value of @xmath77 estimated in this way at a distance of 60pc is an order of magnitude lower than the x - ray measurement , but is in good agreement with the distance of 140pc derived by the latter authors .",
    "this distance would place rx  j@xmath03754on the outskirts of the r  cra cloud using the cloud distance of knude & hg ( 1998 ) of @xmath83pc and within the cloud using the canonical cloud distance of @xmath84  pc . in either case ,",
    "rx  j@xmath03754  would likely lie in a region of relatively high ism density ( @xmath85 - 10 @xmath86 ) .",

    "<S> no unequivocal evidence of spectral line or edge features has been found , arguing against metal - dominated models . </S>",

    "<S> we argue that the derived interstellar medium neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath4 @xmath5 favours the larger distance from two recent hst parallax analyses , placing rx  j@xmath03754  at @xmath6  pc instead of @xmath1  pc , and in the outskirts of the r  cra dark molecular cloud . that such a comparatively rare region of high ism density is precisely where an isolated neutron star re - heated by accretion of interstellar matter would be expected is either entirely coincidental , or current theoretical arguments excluding this scenario for rx  j@xmath03754  are premature . </S>",
    "<S> taken at face value , the combined observational evidence  a lack of spectral and temporal features , and an implied radius @xmath7 - 8.2  km that is too small for current neutron star models  points to a more compact object , such as allowed for quark matter equations of state . </S>"
