    "the problem of diffusion through traps @xcite is generally discussed in the literature by refering to the single trap system . in @xcite",
    "an infinite mutitrap system arranged over all space was discussed and the application of traps to long chain polymers was considered in @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the aspect of the density of one - dimensional traps in a finite spatial section was discussed and it was shown that the larger this density is the higher is the transmission of particles through this dense system of traps . in this work",
    "we refer , especially , to the small number of traps system and find the conditions under which the transmission through them is maximal .",
    "that is , assuming an ensemble of classical particles we look for the conditions that enable all or most of them to pass through the trap system .",
    "we apply in this work the transfer matrix method @xcite used in @xcite with respect to the multitrap system .    in section ii",
    "we introduce the one - dimensional @xmath2 trap system , the relevant nomination and terminology and , especially , the appropriate transfer matrix formalism as in @xcite . in section",
    "iii we pay special attention to a small section of the @xmath2 trap system that includes @xmath3 traps where @xmath3 is a small number .",
    "we will find how the passage of classical particles through this subsystem is influenced by the relevant parameters of it .",
    "these parameters are the number @xmath3 of traps , the total extent @xmath4 of the subsystem , the ratio @xmath5 of the total interval among its traps to the total width of them @xcite , the time at which the subsystem is observed and the degree @xmath6 of its imperfection .",
    "note that the ideal trap is characterized @xcite by @xmath7 in which case all the approaching particles are absorbed by it .",
    "in section iv we discuss the behaviour of the transmission amplitude for some specific values of its parameters .",
    "this transmission amplitude is defined @xcite as the ratio of the value of the imperfect trap coefficient of the transmitted particles at the last trap to its value at the first one .",
    "we discuss now this transmission amplitude by considering the ratio of the ideal trap coefficient of the density of the passing particles at the last trap to its value at the first one .",
    "we show that this amplitude increases to unity for increasing @xmath5 and for large values of the remarked variables @xmath4 , and @xmath6 .",
    "this amplitude , on the other hand , decreases with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "note that although one may expect the transmission to decrease for increasing @xmath6 since this signifies , as remarked , a strengthening of the ideal character of the trap system which entails a large absorption of the passing particles , nevertheless the obtained results are exactly the opposite .",
    "we show that the deviation from the expected results is due to the initial and boundary - value conditions we employ for the imperfect trap system discussed here ( see the set ( 3 ) in @xcite and set [ e4 ] ) here ) which are different from those of the ideal ones ( see the set ( 2 ) in @xcite and set ( [ e3 ] ) here ) .",
    "that is , the influence of the time factor that emerges from these conditions is much more large than that of @xmath6 in such a way that it veils the expected influence of the latter especially during the initial time .",
    "we accompany our calculations with figures that exemplify the results obtained for representative values of @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "the problem we discuss here is the diffusion limited reaction in the presence of @xmath2 traps where , compared to the case discussed in @xcite , @xmath2 assumes small values .",
    "these traps are arrayed in an ordered one - dimensional structure along a spatial axis .",
    "we denote the total width of the traps by @xmath9 and the total interval among them by @xmath10 .",
    "thus , for a total number of traps @xmath2 the width of each is @xmath11 and the interval between any two neighbouring traps is @xmath12 since there are @xmath13 intervals among @xmath2 traps .",
    "an important parameter related to this system is the ratio @xmath5 of the total interval @xmath10 to the total width @xmath9 , that is , @xmath14 .",
    "thus , denoting the total length of the system @xmath15 by @xmath4 one may express the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 as @xcite @xmath16 the relevant one - dimensional initial and boundary value diffusion problem in the presence of @xmath2 traps is @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the density of the particles diffusing through the traps .",
    "@xmath19 is the first order partial derivative with respect to the time variable @xmath8 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the first and second order partial derivatives with respect to the spatial variable @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the diffusion constant which may be of two kinds ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 which are the diffusion constants inside and outside the traps respectively .",
    "the second and third equations in the set ( [ ee2 ] ) are the initial and boundary value conditions respectively .",
    "the range of @xmath26 in the third equation of the set ( [ ee2 ] ) is due to the fact that each trap has front and back faces .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the diffusion problem from the set ( [ ee2 ] ) may be separated into the following two problems @xmath27 @xmath28 the set ( [ ee3 ] ) is the one - dimensional initial and boundary value diffusion problem in the presence of @xmath2 ideal traps and the set ( [ ee4 ] ) is that in the presence of @xmath2 imperfect traps .",
    "the general solution of the set ( [ ee2 ] ) is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the density of the ideal trap set @xmath31 and @xmath32 is that of the imperfect trap one @xmath33 .",
    "the appropriate @xmath34 that satisfies the first and third equations of the set ( [ ee3 ] ) is @xmath35 .",
    "thus , using the separation of variables method @xcite one may write for @xmath30 and @xmath32 that satisfy the appropriate initial and boundary value conditions @xmath36 @xmath37\\ ] ] the @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the error and complementary error functions respectively defined as @xcite @xmath40 we use in the following , as in @xcite ) , the transfer matrix method @xcite an important element of which is the assumption that the density @xmath18 and its partial derivative with respest to @xmath22 changes continously along the section @xmath41 .",
    "thus , one may equate at each of the @xmath42 faces of the @xmath2 traps the @xmath18 and @xmath20 at one side of it to the corresponding quantities just at the other side as done in @xcite .",
    "in such a way one may obtain @xmath42 two dimensional transfer matrices each of them relates the values of the coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 from eq ( [ ee5 ] ) at one side of a face of a trap to the corresponding values of these coefficients at the other side of this face .",
    "we multiply together any two transfer matrices related to the two faces of the same trap so as to have one two - dimensional transfer matrix for each trap . thus , denoting these matrices by @xmath45 we may write the general transfer matrix equation for the one - dimensional @xmath2 trap system that relates the coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 at the left face of the first trap to those at the right face of the last trap assuming that the diffusing particles enter the traps through their left faces @xcite ) . @xmath46",
    "each @xmath45 is , as remarked , a two - dimensional transfer matrix that relates the coeffiecients @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the ideal and imperfect trap density functions of the passing particles at one side of the relevant trap to those at the other side .",
    "the number of traps is @xmath2 and by @xmath47 we denote the general trap in this system .",
    "note that each matrix @xmath45 depends also @xcite upon the time @xmath8 , the constant @xmath6 @xcite , and upon the two diffusion constants @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "but , as seen in @xcite ( see also eq ( [ e1 ] ) ) , the matrices @xmath45 differ from each other by only the values of @xmath22 and share the same values of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath25 and @xmath24 .    as seen in @xcite the element @xmath48 in each @xmath45",
    "is always zero and the other elements @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given , for the value of @xmath52 , by @xcite @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in the former equations are given as ( we write them for @xmath25 ) @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61",
    "it was shown in @xcite for the multitrap system that the transmission coefficient which was calculated as the ratio of the imperfect trap coefficient of the particles after passing through the system to that before this passage tends to unity for the cases of : 1 ) when the total length of the system @xmath62 grows .",
    "2 ) when the total length @xmath4 is constant and the ratio @xmath63 of the total interval to the total width of the system increases . for these two cases the elements @xmath50 and @xmath51 tend to zero ( as remarked , the value of the element @xmath48 is always zero ) and @xmath49 tends to unity which are the required conditions to obtain a unity value for the transmission coefficient .",
    "moreover , it has been shown @xcite that these specific values of the elements @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath49 are , especially , obtained in the limit of @xmath64 .",
    "we , now , discuss , as noted , the ideal trap component of the transmission coefficient and find that this kind of behaviour may be discerned in small sections of the @xmath2 system that contain small number of traps .",
    "we show in the following that the transmission coefficient may indeed assume , under certain conditions , a unity value for this case also .",
    "thus , refering to a two trap section in the @xmath2 system we may write , using eq ( [ e1 ] ) , the relevant matrix expression for it @xmath65 \\cdot \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\cdot \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } t_{11}(\\frac{(n-1)(a+b)}{n } ) & 0 \\\\   t_{21}(\\frac{(n-1)(a+b)}{n } ) & t_{22}(\\frac{(n-1)(a+b)}{n } ) \\end{array }   \\right ] \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } a _ { 2(n-2)+1}\\\\ b _ { 2(n-2)+1 } \\end{array } \\right ) =   \\label{e8 } \\\\ & & = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } t_{11}(\\frac{n(a+b)}{n})t_{11}(\\frac{(n-1)(a+b)}{n})&0 \\\\   t_{21}(\\frac{n(a+b)}{n})t_{11}(\\frac{(n-1)(a+b)}{n})+ t_{22}(\\frac{n(a+b)}{n}t_{21}(\\frac{(n-1)(a+b)}{n } ) & t_{22}(\\frac{n(a+b)}{n}t_{22}(\\frac{(n-1)(a+b)}{n } ) \\end{array }   \\right ] \\cdot \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\cdot \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } a_{2(n-2)+1 } \\\\ b _ { 2(n-2)+1 } \\end{array } \\right ) \\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath66 is the ideal trap coefficient that refers to the trap just before the discussed two trap section and @xmath67 is the one that refers to the second trap in this specific section . @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the corresponding imperfect traps coefficients .",
    "the matrix equation ( [ e8 ] ) may be decomposed to yield the following expressions for the relevant coefficients . @xmath70 @xmath71 using eqs ( [ e8])-([e9 ] ) we may write eq ( [ e10 ] ) as @xmath72 in order to be able to solve the last equation for @xmath73 we use , for the ratio of the imperfect trap coefficient of the last trap to the ideal one of the first , an assumption analogous to that in @xcite .",
    "that is , when discussing the @xmath74 marix method after eq ( 29 ) in @xcite we assume that the larger is the number of imperfect traps the smaller is the ideal transmission coefficient at the last trap compared to the imperfect one at the first trap .",
    "we made here a similar assumption for the ratio of the imperfect trap coefficient at the last trap to the ideal one at the first .",
    "that is , the imperfect component of the density that remains after passing all the traps must be small compared to the ideal component of the density before approaching them .",
    "we discuss here the case of a small number @xmath3 so we may assume that this ratio depends on @xmath3 and @xmath75 as @xmath76 the last expression ensures that the ratio at the left hand side vanishes in the limit of a very large @xmath3 where @xmath75 tend to unity @xcite . denoting the expression that multiply @xmath77 in the first term on the right hand side of eq ( [ e11 ] ) as @xmath78 and the second term as @xmath79 we write eq ( [ e11 ] ) , using eq ( [ e12 ] ) in which @xmath80 , as @xmath81 we may generalize the last equation that was written for the two trap section for any finite number @xmath3 of traps so that the corresponding analog of eq ( [ e13 ] ) is @xmath82 where it may be shown that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are given by the following recursive equations @xmath85 @xmath86 note that the parameter @xmath3 refers to the finite @xmath3 trap system which is a susbsystem of the @xmath2 multitrap one whereas the parameter @xmath47 denotes the general term of the last system ( it actually refers to the position of the last trap of the subsystem in the larger @xmath2 trap system ) . now , it may be shown from the definitions of the variables @xmath83 and @xmath84 that the range of @xmath84 that involves the quantities @xmath51 is in the interval @xmath87 and that of @xmath83 that involves @xmath49 and @xmath50 is in @xmath88 .",
    "also , it may be seen that @xmath83 grows in absolute value with @xmath3 and @xmath84 decreases to zero with increasing @xmath3 so that in the limit of very large @xmath3 the transmission amplitude tends to unity as shown in @xcite .",
    "the same result is obtained also for increasing @xmath5 where @xmath83 decreases to zero and @xmath84 increases to its maximum value of unity so that in the limit of very large @xmath5 the transmission amplitude tends to unity as may be seen from eq ( [ e14 ] ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "unlike the discussion in @xcite which , especially , takes account of a large number of traps we discuss here , as remarked , the influence of a small number of them .",
    "first of all one finds , as expected , that the smaller is the number of traps @xmath3 the easier is for the classical particles to pass through them .",
    "the criterion for this transmission is , as remarked the ratio of the value of the ideal trap coefficient at the last trap ( of the @xmath3 member subsystem ) to its value at the first one .",
    "this is the ratio @xmath75 from eq ( [ e14 ] ) which may be regarded as a transmission amplitude .",
    "note that this amplitude may have values outside the range of @xmath89 .",
    "an easy passage through the trap system is obtained not only for small values of @xmath3 but also for large values of the total length @xmath4 of the system as we have found in @xcite for the multitrap case .",
    "the same result is obtained also for large @xmath6 .",
    "note that the nature of the change of the transmission amplitude with time is opposite to that regarding @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "that is , this amplitude decreases with increasing time .",
    "moreover , this decrease occurs in a very fast manner , especially at the initial time , compared to the remarked increase with @xmath6 and @xmath4 as may be seen in figures 6 - 8 .",
    "each of the following eight figures contains six curves of the transmission amplitude from eq ( [ e14 ] ) as functions of the parameter @xmath5 for the six values of @xmath90 .",
    "as remarked and shown in @xcite with respect to the multitrap system this transmission amplitude tends to unity for large values of @xmath5 .",
    "we find here the dependence of the transmission upon @xmath5 for small @xmath3 and the small range of @xmath91 .",
    "all the curves in the eight figures are drawn for the specific values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these values yield results that are qualitatively similar for a wide class of different applications that use the trap system as a model ( for example , @xmath94 is the order of magnitude one may find in the literature for the diffusion constant @xmath23 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure ( p. 337 in @xcite ) ) .",
    "we find that the larger is @xmath3 the slower is the approach of its corresponding curve to unity compared to that of the smaller @xmath3 curves .",
    "thus , not all the six curves for @xmath90 are actually shown in each figure as in figures 1 and 4 in which the larger @xmath3 curves are merged with the abcissa axis .",
    "the correct order of the curves in each figure is downward so that smaller values of @xmath3 fit the upper curves ( the graph for @xmath95 is the upper one , that for @xmath96 is the second from above and so on ) .",
    "the group of figures 1 - 8 demonstrate this behaviour of the transmission amplitude from eq ( [ e14 ] ) as function of @xmath5 .",
    "the first three figures , each composed of six curves for @xmath90 , show how the transmission amplitude changes with @xmath5 for the same values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 but three different values of @xmath99 .",
    "figure 1 is drawn for @xmath100 and shows only the curves for @xmath101 whereas those for @xmath102 are merged with the abcissa axis .",
    "figure 2 , which is for @xmath103 , shows all the six curves approaching unity as @xmath5 grows but , as remarked , this approach is slower the larger is @xmath3 .",
    "figure 3 , which is drawn for @xmath104 , shows once again all the six curves approaching unity but now even the larger @xmath3-values curves tend to unity already at small values of @xmath5 compared to figures 1 - 2 .",
    "thus , as remarked and as shown for the multitrap system in @xcite , the approach of the transmission amplitude to unity is more apparent and faster , even for small @xmath5 , the larger is @xmath4 .",
    "figures 4 - 5 show how the transmission amplitude as a function of @xmath5 changes with @xmath6 .",
    "each curve from the total six curves of each figure in the group of figures 4 - 5 is drawn for @xmath100 and @xmath98 .",
    "figure 4 is for @xmath105 and one may see only the curves for the 4 smaller values of @xmath3 that tend to unity for increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the other two curves for @xmath102 are merged with the abcissa axis .",
    "figure 5 , which is drawn for @xmath106 , shows now all the six curves approaching unity for increasing values of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , as remarked , the higher @xmath6 values guarantees an easy transmission of the passing particles through the system .",
    "note that , as remarked , this high transmission for increasing @xmath6 is contrary to what one may expect that large @xmath6 entails a large absorption @xcite of the passing particles .",
    "the deviation of the obtained results from the expected ones is because the trap problem we try to solve here , as in @xcite , is the imperfect trap one and not the ideal one .",
    "thus , the initial and boundary - value conditions employed are not the ideal ones ( the set ( 3 ) ) but the imperfect ( the set ( 4 ) ) and these may cause a large transmission even at the ideal trap limit of @xmath107 as actually shown in @xcite ( see figure 2 there ) .",
    "the presence of the time factor in the initial and boundary - value conditions introduces interesting results that do not appear in the absence of it .",
    "for example , the analogous quantum one - dimensional multibarrier system along a finite section @xcite does not involve any time variation and as a consequence the kind of change with time found here is not encountered there @xcite .",
    "this kind of change is especially realized in the much more apparent and conspicuous manner , compared to that encountered for @xmath4 and @xmath6 , by which the transmission amplitude as function of @xmath5 changes for different values of the time @xmath8 .",
    "first of all , unlike the cases for @xmath6 and @xmath4 , this amplitude decreases with increasing @xmath8 especially at the initial values of it .",
    "this is seen in figures 6 - 8 where all the six curves in each figure is drawn for @xmath103 and @xmath108 .",
    "the curves of figure 6 are graphed for @xmath109 and one may see that all the six curves tend uniformly as a single graph to unity already at small values of @xmath5 .",
    "figure 7 is drawn for @xmath110 and one may see how at the small time span of 1.59 the curves become widely separated from each other so as those that correspond to the higher @xmath3 values tend slowly to unity compared to those of the lower @xmath3 .",
    "this form of the figure generally remains stabilized with time and change only slightly by further increasing the time .",
    "in other words , a very large change in the behaviour of the transmission amplitude , as a function of @xmath5 , occurs during the initial time and then it remains almost stabilized . to further demonstrate the large influence of time we show in figure 8 the transmission amplitude , as function of @xmath5 , for @xmath103 , @xmath108 and @xmath98 and for @xmath111",
    "a very similar figure is shown in figure 2 which is drawn for the same values of @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath3 but for @xmath97 .",
    "that is , increasing @xmath6 from @xmath97 by 6 units , keeping the same values of @xmath103 and @xmath98 , have a negligible influence upon the transmission amplitude . but increasing the time by only 0.6 , keeping the former values of @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 , results in a discernable effect upon the transmission amplitude as shown in figure 7 which is drawn for the same values of @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 as in figure 8 but at @xmath110 ( compare the two figures 7 - 8 ) .",
    "we have discussed in this work the effects of a one dimensional trap system upon the density of the passing classical particles .",
    "we have limit our discussion to the case of small number of traps ( the large number case was discussed in @xcite ) . as our analytical means we use the transfer matrix method discussed in @xcite with respect to the one - dimensional multitrap system .",
    "we have shown that the transmission amplitude tends to unity , for growing @xmath5 , not only in the limit of a very large number of traps as in @xcite but also , under certain conditions , for the small number of them .",
    "these conditions involve either a large value of the parameter @xmath6 or of the total length @xmath4 of the system .",
    "these results have been exemplified for specific values of @xmath6 and @xmath4 and demonstrated by the attached figures .    unlike the remarked change of this amplitude with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath4 it has an opposite behaviour regarding the time @xmath8 .",
    "that is , it decreases for all values of @xmath3 as @xmath8 increases where this decrease is larger for large @xmath3 .",
    "also , compared to @xmath6 and @xmath4 , this change with time is very fast especially at the initial time and then the transmission amplitude stabilizes and changes only slightly with time . we have also shown for small @xmath3 , as for the multitrap system in @xcite , that the imperfect character of the system which is expressed in its initial and boundary - value conditions causes it to behave contrary to what is expected for large @xmath6 .",
    "that is , although large value of @xmath6 indicates , as remarked , a large absorption of the passing particles , nevertheless , we find a high transmission for large @xmath6 due to the appearance of time in the initial and boundary - value conditions .",
    "the large influence of the time upon the transmission amplitude have been shown and demonstrated in figures 6 - 8 .",
