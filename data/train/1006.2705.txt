    "in particular , when relativistic effects are considered the channel capacity is modified .",
    "most interestingly , in a communication between users who age at different rates there appears an asymmetry in channel capacity @xcite .",
    "we show some basic scenarios in which this asymmetry can be used to create a private channel between slowly aging users . under the presence of a fixed local noise",
    "the `` young '' users can extract meaningful data from the channel while faster aging eavesdroppers lose the signal against the background noise .",
    "we give an example of secure channels based on the gravitational redshift and propose an alternative version of the twin paradox in which two travelling twins can communicate freely in the presence of different inertial observers .",

    "we consider the family of signals of duration @xmath1 , bandwidth @xmath2 and power @xmath3 .",
    "while , strictly , no signal can be limited in both time and frequency , these signals can approximate any real signal with any desired accuracy @xcite .",
    "we take a simplified communication system with one transmitter , one ideal lossless channel and a receiver which introduces a noise of power @xmath4 . for this channel ,",
    "shannon s formula gives a capacity of @xmath5 bits per second , where @xmath6 is the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "if we try to send more bits per second ( use a data rate @xmath7 ) , the receiver has almost zero probability of translating the signal into data . for any lower rate @xmath8",
    "there is always an encoding which allows for essentially error - free transmission .",
    "we will assume both for the non - relativistic and relativistic cases that there is an additive white gaussian noise source at the receiver with constant power spectral density @xmath9 .",
    "in this case @xmath10 .    if the receiver , including the noise source , is moving with respect to the transmitter , relativity predicts different signal parameters at the transmitter and the receiver .",

    "the results can be extended to arbitrary signals in the presence of gravitational doppler factors .",
    "consider two observers at rest at different points of a stationary gravitational field .",
    "in that case , @xmath23 is a constant of motion @xcite .",
    "the energy ratio for different observers is equal to the doppler factor and is the inverse of the ratio between time intervals as measured in each frame @xmath24 .",
    "these are the same ratios we had in the photon example .",
    "as this conservation of energy is valid for light and matter , the relativistic channel capacity formula can be extended to signals of any nature .",
    "it will hold the same for radio or sound waves or even for cannonballs .",
    "strictly speaking , the asymptotic results of the noisy channel theorem are only valid for signals where @xmath25 and @xmath12 is constant . for more complicated situations where the gravitational field is not stationary or the receiver is moving with a non - uniform velocity , we can calculate the average channel capacity assuming intervals of constant @xmath12 for which we can use the relativistic shannon formula . this average capacity can help us to derive bounds on the maximum number of bits a user can decode during a time @xmath1 .",
