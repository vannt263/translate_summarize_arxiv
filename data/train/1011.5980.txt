    "single stiff biopolymers exhibit a rich mechanical response @xcite . in - vitro reconstituted solutions of such biopolymers hint at how cells can acquire a considerable macroscopic strength from a purely topological microscopic constraint and thermal fluctuations , utilizing a minimum amount of material . though the individual polymers only have to respect a simple constraint , namely the mutual impenetrability of the polymer backbones , complex soft - solid mechanical behavior arises at densities that would correspond to a very dilute gas without polymerization and a certain flexibility allowing for thermal backbone undulations . to deform an entangled polymer ,",
    "surrounding polymers need to be pushed out of the way , as familiar from knotted strings .",
    "this mechanism leads to confinement of the individual polymers in effective tube - like cages , from which they only escape very slowly by a snake - like motion called reptation @xcite .",
    "the suppression of chain motion perpendicular to the tube backbone is responsible for the remarkable integrity of the transient network .",
    "a microscopic derivation of this confinement poses formidable theoretical challenges , and there has so far been little progress beyond the introduction of basic topological invariants characterizing polymer entanglement @xcite and a phenomenological primitive path analysis @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , self - consistent approximations for the dynamics of rigid @xcite and the equilibrium statistical mechanics of semiflexible @xcite topologically entangled chains have been worked out , and these treatments can predict salient properties of the reptation dynamics and the postulated tube . for stiff but not rigid polymers , with a large but finite persistence length @xmath1 , the tube confinement of the transverse fluctuations of a representative test chain is implemented by a harmonic potential of stiffness @xmath2 .",
    "the confinement geometry is characterized by an entanglement ( or collision ) length @xmath3 and the tube width @xmath4 @xcite , both of which are functions of @xmath2 .",
    "the former is a measure of the average spacing between adjacent collisions with background polymers , each of which contribute an amount @xmath5 to the average confinement energy of the test chain .",

    "its mean value @xmath7 as a function of monomer concentration has been predicted theoretically based on a binary collision approximation ( bca ) and an effective medium approximation ( ema ) @xcite .",
    "the bca focuses on the pairwise entanglement topology of a test chain , while the ema aims to account for the collective network fluctuations .",
    "more recently , these mean - field type theories have been challenged by the observation of pronounced heterogeneities of the local tube width @xmath8 along the tube contour , which have been systematically studied in experiments @xcite and in simulations @xcite .",
    "the tube heterogeneities have been statistically quantified by a broad and skewed tube width distribution @xmath9 , which has been analyzed by an empirical model @xcite and by a generalization of the bca @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we develop a systematic , bca - based theory to describe the fluctuations of the tube radius in an entangled polymer solution on the scale of individual tube collisions .",
    "thereby , the local tube radius heterogeneities @xmath8 and their distribution @xmath9 can be determined , and @xmath9 is found to be a universal non - gaussian scaling function with a stretched tail . by comparison with the segment fluid approach of ref .",

    "we consider a stiff test polymer in the presence of surrounding uncrossable polymers , which are imposing topological constraints on its conformation . we restrict our discussion to tightly entangled polymers that are characterized by small transverse excursions around an average path , the preferred contour .",
    "the tube concept concerns quantities in an intermediate equilibrium , i.e.  on time scales @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time for the confined degrees of freedom to equilibrate inside the tube and @xmath14 is the disengagement time of the polymer from its initial tube . in",
    "what follows , a strong scale separation @xmath15 is assumed .",
    "then , in the idealized limit @xmath16 , the topological relationships of the solution will be asymptotically conserved , and the average positions of the background polymers and their mutual topological relationships can be considered as effectively frozen ( or `` quenched '' ) , thus collectively giving rise to a ( quasi - static ) confinement potential representing the tube .",
    "we denote the thermal average with respect to a given `` quenched '' configuration by angular brackets @xmath17 and the average over different configurations and topologies of the tube by an over - bar @xmath18 .",
    "these ensemble averages correspond to temporal averages over several time intervals of length @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "we refer to this event as a tube collision . to calculate the contribution of the pair collision to the confinement free energy",
    ", the bca distinguishes between two states : a hypothetical state , in which the test chain is transparent with respect to collisions with the background chain and a state in which the chains are mutually uncrossable . due to the key assumption that the collisions along the test chain are uncorrelated , the environment of the collision point is completely random in the transparent state , i.e.  the distribution of transverse distances is unchanged from the gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath7 .",
    "the average free energy of confinement follows from a topological argument . in the uncrossable state for this pair of chains , the configuration space of transverse fluctuations",
    "is divided into two disconnected subspaces corresponding to the ` above ' ( @xmath36 ) and the ` below ' ( @xmath35 ) configuration , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : top ] . the average free energy in the uncrossable state is therefore obtained by averaging the confinement potential in each of these subspaces over the probability for a specific topology and collision geometry .",
