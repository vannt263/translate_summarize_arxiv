    "the interaction of humans on social media platforms mimic their interactions in the real world  @xcite . hence , as in the real world",
    ", `` utility maximization '' underpins human interaction on social media platforms .",
    "utility maximization is the fundamental problem humans face , wherein humans maximize utility given their limited resources of money or attention .",
    "detection of utility maximization behaviour is therefore useful in online social media .",
    "however , a key difference for agents in online social media is the absence of economic incentives .",
    "for example , the majority of content in facebook , youtube and twitter are user - generated with limited or no economic incentives .",
    "hence , as explained in  @xcite , incentives such as `` fun '' and `` fame '' are some of the major attributes of the utility function of online social behaviour .",
    "it is therefore difficult to analytically characterize the utility function and hence any detection of utility maximization behaviour in online social media needs to be necessarily nonparametric in nature .",
    "another key difference is that the utility function in online social media is `` content - aware '' , i.e.  the quality of content affects the utility function . due to the content - aware nature of the utility function and the availability of large amount of user generated content , data from online social media",
    "is high - dimensional .",
    "for example , utility maximization in youtube depends on all the user generated video content available at any point of time .",
    "the problem of nonparametric detection of utility maximizing behaviour is the central theme in the area of revealed preferences in microeconomics .",
    "this is fundamentally different to the theme used widely in the signal processing literature , where one postulates an objective function ( typically convex ) and then develops optimization algorithms .",
    "in contrast , the revealed preference framework , considered in this paper , is _ data centric _ : given a dataset , @xmath0 , consisting of probe , @xmath1 , and response , @xmath2 , of an agent for @xmath3 time instants : @xmath4 revealed preference aims to answer the following question : is the dataset @xmath0 in   consistent with utility - maximization behaviour of an agent ?",
    "a utility - maximization behaviour ( or utility maximizer ) is defined as follows :    an agent is a utility maximizer if , at each time @xmath5 , for input probe @xmath6 , the output response , @xmath7 , satisfies @xmath8 here , @xmath9 denotes a locally non - satiated , there exists another point , @xmath10 , within an @xmath11 distance ( i.e. @xmath12 ) , such that the point @xmath10 provides a higher utility than @xmath13 ( i.e. @xmath14 ) .",
    "local non - satiation models the human preference : _ more is preferred to less _ ] utility function .",
    "also , @xmath15 , is the budget of the agent . the linear constraint",
    ", @xmath16 imposes a _",
    "budget constraint _ on the agent , where @xmath17 denotes the inner product between @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "major contributions to the area of revealed preferences are due to samuelson  @xcite , afriat  @xcite , varian  @xcite , and diewert  @xcite in the microeconomics literature .",
    "afriat  @xcite devised a nonparametric test ( called afriat s theorem ) , which provides necessary and sufficient conditions to detect utility maximizing behaviour for a dataset . for an agent satisfying utility maximization , afriat s theorem  @xcite ( stated below in theorem  [ thm : afriattheorem ] )",
    "provides a method to reconstruct a utility function consistent with the data .",
    "the utility function , so obtained , can be used to predict future response of the agent .",
    "varian  @xcite provides a comprehensive survey of revealed preference literature .    despite being originally developed in economics ,",
    "there has been some recent work on application of revealed preference to social networks and signal processing . in the signal processing literature , revealed preference framework was used for detection of malicious nodes in a social network in  @xcite and in demand estimation in smart grids in  @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzes social behaviour and friendship formation using revealed preference among high school friends .",
    "in online social networks , @xcite uses revealed preference to obtain information about products from bidding behaviour in ebay or similar bidding networks .      in this paper",
    ", we consider an extension of the classical revealed preference framework of  @xcite to agents with `` dynamic utility function '' .",
    "the utility function jump changes at an unknown time instant by a linear perturbation . given the dataset of probe and responses of an agent ,",
    "the objective is to develop a nonparametric test to detect the change point and the utility functions before and after the change , which is henceforth referred to as the change point detection problem .",
    "such change point detection problems arise in online search in social media .",
    "the online search is currently the most popular method for information retrieval  @xcite .",
    "the online search process can be seen as an example of an agent maximizing the information utility , i.e.  the amount of information consumed by an online agent given the limited resource on time and attention .",
    "there has been a gamut of research which links internet search behaviour to ground truths such as symptoms of illness , political election , or major sporting events  @xcite .",
    "detection of utility change in online search , therefore , is helpful to identify changes in ground truth and useful , for example , for early containment of diseases  @xcite or predicting changes in political opinion  @xcite .",
    "also , the intrinsic nature of the online search utility function motivates such a study under a revealed preference setting .",
    "the problem of studying agents with dynamic utility functions , with a linear perturbation change in the utility function is motivated by several reasons .",
    "first , it provides sufficient selectivity such that the non - parametric test is not trivially satisfied by all datasets but still provides enough degrees of freedom .",
    "second , the linear perturbation can be interpreted as the change in the marginal rate of utility relative to a `` base '' utility function .",
    "in online social media , the linear perturbation coefficients measure the impact of marketing or the measure of severity of the change in ground truth on the utility of the agent .",
    "this is similar to the linear perturbation models used to model taste changes  @xcite in microeconomics .",
    "finally , in social networks , linear change in the utility is usually used to model the change in utility of an agent based on the interaction with the agent s neighbours  @xcite .",
    "compared to the taste change model , our model is unique in that we allow the linear perturbation to be introduced at an unknown time . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time in the literature that change point detection problem has been studied in the revealed preference setting .",
    "a related important practical issue that we also consider in this paper is the high dimensionality of data arising in online social media . as an example of high dimensional data arising in online social media",
    ", we investigate the detection of the utility maximization process inherent in one of the most common social media interactions : video sharing via youtube . detecting utility maximization behaviour with such high dimensional ( big ) data is computationally demanding .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ucpd ] , we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for change point detection , for dynamic utility maximizing agents under the revealed preference framework . in sec .",

    "in this section , we consider agents with a dynamic utility function . for completeness , we start with afriat s theorem , in the classical static setting .",
    "afriat s theoremis one of the _ big _ results in revealed preferences in micro - economics theory .    given the dataset @xmath18 in  , the following statements are equivalent :    the agent is a utility maximizer and there exists a monotonically increasing and concave.]utility function that satisfies ( [ eqn : utilitymaximization ] ) .    for @xmath19 and @xmath20 the following set of inequalities has a feasible solution : @xmath21    a monotonic and concave utility function that satisfies ( [ eqn : utilitymaximization ] ) is given by : @xmath22",

    "the players in the game have access to the `` buzz '' , which is the online search index , measured by the number of people searching on the yahoo ! search engine for the technology .",
    "the objective of the game is to use the buzz and trade stocks accordingly .",

    "an empirical study of the dataset  @xcite reveal that most of the traders in the buzz game follow utility maximization behaviour .",

    "this correspond to a change in the ground truth which affected the utility of the agents .",

    "the youstatanalyzer database is built using the youstatanalyzer tool  @xcite , which collects statistics of youtube videos using web scrapping technology .",

    "also , a recent study shows that @xmath144 of the youtube views are due to @xmath145 of the videos uploaded  @xcite .",
    "hence , if we restrict attention to popular videos , the view focus tend to remain constant during a time period which correspond to the linear constraint in the revealed preference setting .",
    "the number of videos satisfying the above requirements is @xmath146 , and therefore , the dimension of the probe and response , @xmath147 .",
    "the number of inner product computations required for checking the garp conditions is given by @xmath148 .",

    "note from lemma  [ lem : jl ] and theorem  [ thm : jlimp ] that the dimension of the embedding is independent of the dimension of the probe and the response and hence higher computational savings can be obtained when the dimension of the probe and the response are higher .",
    "the utility function obtained in the lower dimension is useful for visualization , and gives a sparse representation of the original utility function .",
    "below , we use the utility function obtained in the lower dimension to predict total traffic to youtube when the number of subscribers to a particular video changes or when popular youtube users ( people with large number of subscribers ) upload new videos .",
    "the above approach of predicting total number of views complements the findings in  @xcite , where the authors claim that individual views to youtube video or channel can not be predicted .",
    "this predicted total traffic serves as an useful benchmark for allocating server resources without compromising the user experience .",
    "based on the utility function recovered in the lower dimension , one can predict the total traffic in youtube . as before , let @xmath154 and @xmath155 be the number of subscribers and the number of views at time @xmath5 , respectively .",

    "the corresponding value of @xmath162 that rationalizes the data can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem : @xmath163 the values of @xmath164 are such that the garp condition   is satisfied for the dataset @xmath165 .",

    "this paper derived a revealed preference based approach for change point detection in the utility function . the main result ( theorem  [ thm : ac : linear ] ) provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the change point at which the utility function jump changes by a linear perturbation .",
    "in addition , in the presence of noise , we provided a procedure for detecting the unknown change point and a hypothesis test for testing the dataset for dynamic utility maximization .",
    "the results were applied on the yahoo !",
    "tech buzz dataset and the estimated change point corresponds to the change in ground truth .    the application of results developed in this paper provided novel insights into the utility maximizing behaviour of agents in online social media .",
