    "in the past few years , topological phases of matter have attracted considerable interest in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "a central consequence of topologically nontrivial bulk structures , which can be classified by topological invariants in momentum space , is the emergence of zero - energy modes localized at the edge of the system .",
    "several different materials have been experimentally identified as topological insulators ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , whereas unambiguous evidence of their superconducting analogues , topological superconductors , is still lacking despite intense research activities@xcite . in case of topological superconductors ,",
    "the edge modes are majorana bound states ( mbs ) that are highly sought - after both because of their exotic non - abelian statistics and potential application in topological quantum computation@xcite .",
    "concerning the realization of these phases , one has to distinguish between `` intrinsic '' and `` extrinsic '' topological superconductors . in `` extrinsic '' systems ,",
    "superconductivity is induced in a spin - orbit coupled normal conducting material via injection of cooper pairs from a trivial superconductor and , potentially , additional external fields are applied ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in `` intrinsic '' topological superconductors , both superconductivity as well as the nontrivial topology arise spontaneously due to the internal interactions of the system . in particular in the search for the right material for the latter type of topological superconductors , guiding principles are required that go beyond model studies and depend only on very few and easily accessible details of the system , such as symmetries or fermi surface topologies .",
    "a related , but more fundamental , question is whether there is a direct relation between the mechanism that leads to the superconducting instability and the topology of the resulting phase .",
    "e.g. , in ref .  , it has been shown for a specific model of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron fluid in oxide heterostructures that there is a one - to - one correspondence : for conventional , i.e. , electron - phonon induced , superconductivity , the condensate is trivial , whereas in case of an unconventional mechanism , i.e. , superconductivity resulting from electronic particle - hole fluctuations , topologically nontrivial behavior is found .",
    "this can be used to identify the microscopic origin of the pairing state by determining its topological properties .    one promising class of materials for observing intrinsic topological behavior ,",
    "are superconductors where inversion symmetry is already broken in the normal state@xcite",
    ". this can be the case in the bulk of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) material if the crystal structure lacks a center of inversion as , e.g. , for the heavy - fermion superconductor@xcite cept@xmath0si , or for 2d superconductivity at interfaces and surfaces .",
    "examples of the latter are given by oxide heterostructures@xcite and single - layer@xcite fese on srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the main difference as compared to centrosymmetric systems is that the broken inversion symmetry together with atomic spin - orbit coupling remove the spin degeneracy of the fermi surfaces .",
    "the energetic splitting of the fermi surfaces defines an additional energy scale @xmath1 , which essentially changes the theoretical description of superconductivity and has direct consequences for the possible pairing states@xcite .    in this paper , we address both issues of intrinsic topological superconductors outlined above : we derive simple guiding principles for the search for interaction - induced topological superconductivity and relate the mechanism driving the superconducting instability to the topology of the corresponding condensate .",
    "our analysis indicates that magnetic fluctuations , either from the proximity to a magnetic instability or due to magnetic impurities , are essential for the formation of a time - reversal symmetric topological superconductor .",
    "to arrive at these conclusions , we focus on strongly noncentrosymmetric systems in the sense that the spin - orbit splitting @xmath1 exceeds the transition temperature @xmath2 of superconductivity , @xmath3 .",
    "our results are based on exact relations following from symmetries of the system , most notable the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) of the high - temperature phase , and , thus , do not depend on further microscopic details . to describe unconventional pairing",
    ", we apply an effective low - energy approach@xcite where processes at high energies are assumed to lead to fluctuations in the particle - hole channel that eventually drive the superconducting instability .",
    "more specifically , it is shown that , irrespective of whether superconductivity arises from phonons or fluctuations of a time - reversal symmetric order parameter in the particle - hole channel , the resulting condensate will be fully gapped , preserve all point symmetries of the high - temperature phase as well as trs .",
    "the invariance under the reversal of the time direction both crucially affects the electromagnetic response of the system and determines the topological classification of the superconductor as well as the structure of the mbs emerging at edges of the system in case of a topologically nontrivial phase@xcite . to deduce the associated topological invariant ( class diii@xcite )",
    ", we apply the topological hamiltonian approach@xcite using the full green s function obtained from eliashberg theory@xcite .",
    "this captures interaction effects beyond@xcite the mean - field level as the full frequency dependence of the self - energy is taken into account .",
    "we find for phonons or fluctuations of a particle - hole order parameter which is even under time - reversal , that the invariant is generically trivial .",
    "naturally , significant residual coulomb repulsion can lead to a topological phase .",
    "we show that also magnetic impurities can drive the system into a topologically nontrivial superconducting state that still preserves trs . although the disorder required to stabilize the topological structure of the bulk system locally breaks trs , the mbs at the edge of the topological domain",
    "are shown to be protected if there is a residual reflection symmetry at the boundary .    in case of fluctuations of an order parameter that is odd under time - reversal ,",
    "the situation is completely different : the interaction is fully repulsive within and between all fermi surfaces such that the resulting superconducting order parameter will have sign changes , can break any point symmetry as well as the trs of the high - temperature phase .",
    "we consider the limit where the inversion - symmetry breaking terms induce a momentum - space splitting of the fermi surfaces that is smaller than the scale on which the spin - orbit texture varies .",
    "this roughly corresponds to @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the bandwidth of the system .",
    "we derive an asymptotic symmetry and show that all possible superconducting order parameters can be grouped into two classes : the relative sign of the order parameter can only be either positive or negative at _ all _ `` rashba pairs '' of fermi surfaces . here",
    "`` rashba pair '' denotes a pair of fermi surfaces that merge into one doubly degenerate fermi surface upon hypothetically switching off the inversion - symmetry breaking terms in the hamiltonian . to discuss the implications on the topological properties , we focus on fully gapped ( sign changes only between the different fermi surfaces ) and time - reversal symmetric superconductors .",
    "the latter assumption is not very restrictive as many noncentrosymmetric point groups do not allow for spontaneous breaking of trs by a single superconducting phase transition@xcite .",
    "most importantly , we find that , for one - dimensional ( 1d ) and 2d systems , the total number of time - reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) enclosed by rashba pairs of fermi surfaces must be necessarily odd for the superconductor to be topologically nontrivial .",
    "furthermore , in case of a single rashba pair ( two singly - degenerate fermi surfaces ) enclosing an odd number of trim , the resulting superconductor , if fully gapped , will be automatically topological irrespective of the dimensionality of the system ( i.e. , for 1d , 2d and 3d ) .",
    "this confirms and generalizes the correspondence between mechanism and topology found in ref .  .",
    "our results imply that one should look for superconducting systems that are close to a particle - hole instability with an order parameter that is odd under time - reversal ( e.g. , a spin - density wave instability ) for realizing a noncentrosymmetric topological superconductor .",
    "this leads to strong magnetic fluctuations that can drive a superconducting instability .",
    "even if the superconducting state is due to electron - phonon coupling , the proximity to a magnetic phase might lead to the spontaneous formation@xcite of local magnetic moments due to initially nonmagnetic impurities which can induce a transition to a topological phase .",
    "alternatively , intentional magnetic doping can be used to render an electron - phonon superconductor topological . as the fermi surface structure is directly accessible experimentally ,",
    "e.g. , via photoemission experiments , the necessary condition that the total number of trim enclosed by rashba pairs of fermi surfaces must be odd for having a 2d topological superconductor can be readily applied for ruling out certain candidate systems .",
    "we believe that this work will serve as a guiding tool in the search for topologically nontrivial superconducting states and , in addition , help determining the pairing mechanism of noncentrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "although conducting behavior has been observed@xcite for all three different orientations of the interface , superconductivity has so far only been reported for the [ 001]@xcite and [ 110]@xcite heterostructures .",
    "the combination of the small transition temperature@xcite of superconductivity and strong spin - orbit splitting@xcite of the fermi surfaces safely allows for applying the weak - pairing approximation in these systems .",
    "let us first focus on the [ 001]-oriented interface , where superconductivity is associated@xcite with the chemical potential entering the bands derived from the ti @xmath468 and @xmath469 orbitals .",
    "if it is close to the bottom of these bands , there are only two singly - degenerate fermi surfaces . in ref .",

    "all of this is consistent with the analysis presented above which , on top of that , generalizes the absence of topological nontrivial structures in case of phonons beyond the weak - coupling limit considered in ref .   and",
    "shows that the time - reversal properties of the competing spin - density wave ( @xmath470 are key to induce a nontrivial superconductor .",
    "furthermore , when the energetically higher rashba pair of bands@xcite is populated , which can be induced via gate tuning@xcite , the system becomes topologically trivial : naively , two pairs of counter - propagating majorana modes are expected at the boundary which , however , can be gapped out@xcite by surface perturbations that break neither particle - hole nor trs .",
    "finally , we have seen that , even if superconductivity is driven by electron - phonon coupling , magnetic disorder can nonetheless drive the system towards a topological phase .",
    "note that magnetic scattering is expected to be particularly important for laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 heterostructures where oxygen vacancies , which are initially nonmagnetic impurities , are believed@xcite to lead to local magnetic moments on the ti sites .    without taking into account further microscopic details",

    "if the chemical potential is gate tuned@xcite to the lowest rashba pair of bands ( again arising from the @xmath468/@xmath469 orbitals@xcite ) , we obtain the same correspondence between the mechanism and the topology of superconductivity as in the [ 001 ] interface : phonons alone lead to a trivial superconductor , whereas tra fluctuations induce a topological state which will become trivial when populating the second lowest rashba pair of bands .",
    "the second system we will discuss is single - layer fese on [ 001 ] srtio@xmath0 which shows a superconducting transition@xcite at temperatures significantly above @xmath471 .",
    "although the presence of the substrate manifestly breaks inversion symmetry , it is less obvious in this system whether the weak - pairing approximation can be applied due to the larger transition temperature .",
    "if it is appropriate for deducing the superconducting order parameter , we can conclude that , irrespective of the unknown pairing mechanism , the condensate will be topologically trivial .",
    "this follows from the experimental observation@xcite that there are two rashba pairs of fermi surfaces around the @xmath102-point leading to @xmath472 in eq .",

    "note that this does not contradict the recent proposal@xcite of topological superconductivity in this system since the analysis of ref",
    ".   has been performed in the opposite limit where inversion - symmetry breaking can be fully neglected for describing superconductivity .",
    "to summarize , we have considered the relation between the mechanism driving the superconducting instability and the topological and time - reversal properties thereof in noncentrosymmetric systems .",
    "our results are general in the sense that they only depend on very few properties of the system such as the time - reversal behavior of the bosonic fluctuations inducing superconductivity , the symmetries of the crystal and the topology of the fermi surfaces with respect to the trim . throughout the paper , we have been using the weak - pairing approximation , formally defined in eq .  ( [ parameterizationofg ] ) , which is justified as long as @xmath3 .",
    "the superconducting properties are derived using eliashberg theory@xcite .",
    "firstly , we have seen that spontaneous trs breaking is not possible for superconductivity resulting from electron - phonon coupling or from tre particle - hole fluctuations , whereas it can not be excluded when tro particle - hole ( e.g. , spin - density wave ) fluctuations are relevant . in the latter case , only the general necessary condition@xcite , the presence of a threefold rotation symmetry in the normal phase , for spontaneous trs - breaking in 2d noncentrosymmetric systems can be used to gain information about the trs properties of the condensate without detailed microscopic information .",
    "we have shown that the criterion of ref",
    ".   also holds in the presence of both nonmagnetic as well as magnetic ( weak ) disorder that conserves the symmetries of the high - temperature phase only on average .",
    "secondly , it has been proven that superconductivity arising from pure electron - phonon coupling will be fully gapped , neither break any point symmetry of the system nor be topologically nontrivial .",
    "this can be used to gain information about the pairing mechanism of a superconductor : the observation of topologically nontrivial properties , e.g. , mbs at the edge of the sample , indicates that the mechanism can not be purely conventional , i.e. , other interaction channels or significant disorder scattering has to be taken into account for understanding superconductivity .",
    "we have shown that exactly the same conclusions hold if superconductivity is driven by tre particle - hole fluctuations .    in case of tro fluctuations , the superconducting order parameter naturally has sign changes making topologically nontrivial states possible . from the asymptotic symmetry ( [ approximatesymmetryeigenstates ] )",
    "valid for @xmath4 , it follows that all resulting order parameters can be grouped into rashba even ( @xmath283 ) and rashba odd ( @xmath284 ) as defined in eq .",
    "( [ rashbaparity ] ) . focusing on trs - preserving states",
    ", we have shown that only the latter can be topologically nontrivial which leads to constraints on the corresponding topological invariants .",
    "e.g. , it implies that 1d and 2d noncentrosymmetric superconductors can only be topological if the number of trim enclosed by rashba pairs of fermi surfaces is odd .",
    "this necessary condition for topological superconductivity is readily accessible experimentally as the structure of the fermi surfaces can be directly measured in photoemission experiments .",
    "note that one does not have to resolve the spin - orbit splitting as the criterion only refers to rashba _ pairs _ of fermi surfaces .",
    "e.g. , for single - layer fese , photoemission data@xcite indicates that there are two rashba pairs enclosing the @xmath102-point .",
    "if the weak - pairing approximation can be applied in this system , the condensate must be topologically trivial .",

    "focusing on 2d systems , it has been demonstrated that the resulting kramers pair of mbs is protected against magnetic out - of - plane impurities if the associated edge is oriented perpendicular to one of the mirror planes of the bulk point group .",

    "<S> we show that topologically nontrivial behavior can be induced by magnetic doping without gapping out the resulting kramers pair of majorana edge modes . in case of superconductivity arising from the particle - hole fluctuations associated with a competing instability , the properties of the condensate crucially depend on the time - reversal behavior of the order parameter of the competing instability . </S>",
    "<S> when the order parameter preserves time - reversal symmetry , we obtain exactly the same properties as in case of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> if it is odd under time - reversal , the cooper channel of the interaction will be fully repulsive leading to sign changes of the gap and making spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking possible . to discuss topological properties , we focus on fully gapped time - reversal symmetric superconductors and derive constraints on possible pairing states that yield necessary conditions for the emergence of topologically nontrivial superconductivity </S>",
    "<S> . these conditions might serve as a tool in the search for topological superconductors . </S>",
