    "sagittarius a * , the compact radio source at the galactic center , is powered by accretion onto an @xmath6 supermassive black hole ( schdel et al . 2002 ; ghez et al .",
    "2004 ; melia 2006 ) .",
    "there is compelling evidence that the near - ir ( nir ) flares in sagittarius a * are produced by relativistic electrons via synchrotron emission within a few schwarzschild radii of the black hole ( genzel et al .",
    "2003 ; the schwarzschild radius @xmath7 ) cm ) .",
    "inverse compton scattering of the nir photons by the same electrons produces x- and @xmath8-ray emission , which may account for the observed x - ray flares ( baganoff et al . 2001 , 2003 ;",
    "goldwurm et al .",
    "2003 ; porquet et al . 2003 ; blanger et al .",
    "simultaneous multi - wavelength observations during a handful of flares have generally supported this hypothesis ( eckart et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ; blanger et al . 2005 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , our knowledge of the flare energization and electron acceleration mechanisms is still very rudimentary , though some details are starting to emerge ( liu et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; tagger & melia 2006 ; bromley , melia , & liu 2001 ; broderick & loeb 2005 ) .",
    "the first nir spectroscopic observations at a frequency @xmath9 hz revealed very soft power spectra , @xmath10 , with index @xmath11 ( eisenhauer et al . 2005 ) , indicating a sharp cutoff in the electron distribution .",
    "such a cutoff is a natural consequence of stochastic acceleration ( sa ) by plasma waves , in which low - energy electrons are accelerated up to a relativistic energy , where radiative cooling becomes important ( schlickeiser 1984 ; park & petrosian 1995 ) . in sagittarius a * , the x - ray flare luminosity is always lower than that of the nir events , so synchrotron cooling dominates .",
    "more recent nir observations also indicate that @xmath12 may be correlated with @xmath13 ( ghez et al .",
    "2005 ; gillessen et al . 2006 ; hornstein et al . 2006 ) .",
    "flares in sagittarius a * are likely driven by an accretion instability ( e.g. , tagger & melia 2006 ) , which triggers the transfer of gravitational energy of the plasma into turbulence . in earlier work , we demonstrated that if thermal synchrotron and synchrotron self - comptonization are the dominant emission mechanisms during sagittarius a * s flares , simultaneous x - ray and nir spectroscopic observations ( sso ) can measure the size of the flare region @xmath3 , the electron density @xmath1 and `` temperature '' @xmath14 , and the magnetic field @xmath0 ( liu , melia , & petrosian 2006 ) .",
    "interestingly , most of the flares are found to be local events with the source size @xmath15 , which can also explain the quasi - period modulations observed in some flares ( see also liu , petrosian , & melia 2004 ) .",
    "this justifies the neglect of the source structure as a zero order approximation and suggests that the flares involve highly dynamical activity and the electron acceleration process has to be addressed to uncover the underlying physical processes .    in this paper",
    ", we consider steady state electron populations produced via sa by turbulent plasma waves which , in combination with the synchrotron cooling , results in a relativistic maxwellian distribution .",
    "the electron temperature is set by the energy diffusion and synchrotron cooling rates .",
    "the latter depends only on @xmath0 , while the former is given by a combination of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 , which together imply that the product @xmath16 should not vary significantly as the flare evolves , nor from one flare to the next .",
    "moreover , since electrons gain energy from the plasma waves , overall energy conservation requires that the luminosity be equal to the energy transfer rate from turbulence , which also depends only on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 .",
    "this requires @xmath17 to be constant .",
    "these two system constraints effectively reduce the model parameters to just two , so that sso can readily test the model .    previous work on the flares is summarized in   [ bgd ] , where we discuss difference between these models and assess the merit of previous proposed scenarios on the definiteness of their predictions and/or whether the model parameters can be well constrained by observations .",
    "the electron acceleration is described in   [ acc ] . and in   [ apl ] the model",
    "is applied to an nir flare with a very hard spectrum .",
    "the model predictions and its limitations are discussed in ",
    "several models have been proposed since the _ chandra _ discovery of a bright x - ray flare from sagittarius a * ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 ; markoff et al .",
    "2001 ; liu & melia 2002 ; yuan et al . 2004",
    "; nayakshin , cuadra , & sunyaev 2004 ) . the facts that the flare variation time scale is comparable to the orbital period at the last stable orbit and there is a good correlation between the x - ray and the strongly polarized nir emission suggests that the flares are produced very close to the black hole .",
    "the nature of the correlation between an x - ray flare and a delayed radio outburst , on the other hand , indicates that the radio emission may be produced at large radii ( zhao et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the jet model studied by markoff et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , it was assumed that the electrons and protons are maxwellian and have the same temperature , the plasma near the base of the jet , which is within a few schwarzschild radii of the black hole , are heated suddenly to a higher temperature during flares via shocks or magnetic field reconnection . by changing the physical conditions at the base of the jet , they were able to reproduce the observed x - ray flux .",
    "the distinct spectral and polarization characteristics of sub - millimeter emission , on the other hand , suggests that this radiation is produced by a small hot magnetized accretion torus near the black hole ( melia et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "the flat spectrum of the x - ray flares then motivated us to consider the production of x - rays via bremsstrahlung during an accretion instability ( liu & melia 2002 ) . to reduce the model parameters ,",
    "the electrons and protons were assumed in thermal equilibrium in this calculation .",
    "yuan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) later considered a more complicated accretion model , where the electrons and protons have different temperatures and there is a non - thermal component in the electron distribution prescribed by the choice of particle acceleration processes . with the temperature for the thermal component , the spectral index , high energy cutoff , and normalization factor characterizing the non - thermal component as free parameters",
    ", it can accommodate a variety of flare spectra .",
    "all these models are still consistent with the limited nir and x - ray observations , due in part to the large number of model parameters and the relative paucity of data .",
    "it is clear that one must address the electron acceleration mechanism in order to ( possibly ) distinguish between these various models . given the physical conditions in the emission region  those of a hot , magnetized plasma ",
    "it is natural to suppose that the electrons are being accelerated by plasma waves ( e.g. , dermer , miller , & li 1996 ) , whose turbulent energy is fed from an accretion - induced instability .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in the generation of turbulence , and in the cascade and damping processes , several parameters were introduced to describe the turbulence spectrum ( liu et al .",
    "not surprisingly , as was the case for the previous models , the available observations could not provide rigorous constraints on the parameters .",
    "nevertheless , this first attempt at building a physical model suggested that some of the flares are actually produced within a region smaller than the size of the black hole , indicating that they are likely events localized in certain portions of the disk .",
    "the discovery of nir flares with very soft spectra implies a sharp cutoff in the relativistic electron distribution producing the polarized nir emission via synchrotron . for typical conditions near the black hole inferred from the modeling of sagittarius",
    "a * s quiescent emission ( melia et al . 2001 ; yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) , the synchrotron cooling time of electrons producing nir emission is also comparable to the flare variation time scale and may therefore be the cause of the cutoff .",
    "subsequent work with this model showed that the electron acceleration may be insensitive to the details of the turbulence spectrum and that such a cutoff is a natural consequence of sa of electrons by turbulence ( liu et al .",
    "2006 ) . moreover , if the injection of particles into the acceleration region is slow , the electron spectrum in steady state may be approximated as a relativistic maxwellian distribution . in this case , there are only four model parameters , namely the source size @xmath3 , the electron temperature @xmath18 and density @xmath1 , and the magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "this model has therefore now matured to the point where its parameters may be readily determined by sso .",
    "of course , this does not yet mean that sa is solely responsible for accelerating the electrons .",
    "other mechanisms may also produce similar distributions .",
    "tagger and melia ( 2006 ) first showed that the rossby wave instability in a small accretion torus can reproduce the characteristics of the flare light curves .",
    "in such a picture the gravitational energy of protons and ions is released by this macroscopic instability , which generates the turbulence on a scale comparable to @xmath3 .",
    "the turbulence then cascades toward small scales and accelerates electrons in the process .",
    "it is clear that the whole plasma in the turbulent region can be energized by the gravitational energy release .",
    "we therefore do not need a continuous injection of electrons at low energies .",
    "moreover , since the plasma is gravitationally trapped by the black hole , the accelerated electrons will not escape from the acceleration region as long as its energy is lower than the gravitational banding energy of the protons , which is comparable to the protons rest mass energy .",
    "the evolution of an electron distribution @xmath19 under the influence of a turbulent magnetic field is given therefore by ( blandford & eichler 1987 ) @xmath20\\ , , \\label{kinetic}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the lorentz factor is equal to the energy diffusion rate @xmath22 as is usually true in sa by plasma waves , where a prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath8 . in a more general case , where the direct acceleration rate @xmath23 the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ kinetic ] ) should be @xmath24^\\prime$ ] .",
    "] and the synchrotron cooling and acceleration times are given , respectively , by , @xmath25 where @xmath26 cm s@xmath27 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath28 gauss , @xmath29 @xmath30 , @xmath31 cm , and @xmath32 is a dimensionless quantity that depends on the microscopic details of the wave - particle interaction , and is of order 1 if the scattering mean - free - path is comparable to @xmath3 , which may be smaller than the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath33 cm ) of the black hole .",
    "the other constants have their usual meaning .",
    "note that in equation ( [ acct ] ) the velocity of the scatterers in the original sa proposed by fermi ( 1949 ) has been replaced by the alfvn velocity @xmath34 .",
    "this may not be always true especially when the sound velocity @xmath35 .",
    "the exact dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath37 and @xmath34 is still under investigation . because @xmath37 also depends on the proton temperature , which is an input in the model , here we focus on the simplest scenario , where the effects of sound waves are ignored . and as we shall see below , particle - particle collisions can be ignored , and the electrons are mainly scattered by the turbulence . since the inferred particle pressure is much higher than the magnetic field pressure , @xmath3 is the only length scale in the system and should be comparable to the particle mean - free - path . if the flares are triggered by instabilities that are similar from event to event , @xmath32 should be nearly constant .",
    "in steady state this yields . ] @xmath38 the normalization of @xmath39 is accurate to order @xmath40 .",
    "therefore @xmath41 only depends on the instabilities and should not change significantly with time .",
    "the thermal synchrotron flux density and emission coefficient ( i.e. emissivity divided by the solid angle ) are given , respectively , by ( petrosian 1981 ; mahadevan , narayan , & yi 1996 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 hz , and the distance to the galactic center @xmath45 kpc .",
    "the spectral index in a given narrow frequency range is therefore @xmath46 and the flux density may be written @xmath47 the thick lines in figure [ fig1.ps ] ( left ) exhibit this spectral index ( dotted ) , and the normalized spectrum @xmath48 ( solid ) , as functions of the normalized frequency @xmath49 .",
    "we can estimate the energy transfer rate in a fully developed turbulence from dimensional analysis : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is another dimensionless quantity that only depends on the turbulence generation mechanism and therefore remains nearly a constant could be a complicated function of @xmath37 and @xmath34 .",
    "we , however , focus on the simplest case . ] .",
    "if there are no other significant energy loss processes , this energy transfer rate should be equal to the source luminosity ( @xmath52 ) in the steady state , where @xmath53 we therefore infer that @xmath54 a condition that should not change significantly with time either .",
    "we note that the electron advection occurs on the accretion time , which can be more than 10 times longer than the dynamical time .",
    "this term is negligible during flares ( see   [ dis ] ) . and even though there are other energy loss processes , such as the diffusive escape of accelerated particles and/or the propagation of waves away from the flare region ( petrosian & liu 2004 ) , we expect that an approximately fixed fraction of the released energy goes into radiation .",
    "this constraint is still valid .    for given values of @xmath32 and @xmath51 , spectroscopic observations in the nir band",
    "then can be used to determine the properties of the flaring plasma .",
    "first from equation ( [ alpha ] ) and the observed spectral index @xmath13 , one can obtain @xmath49 , which in combine with equations ( [ xm ] ) and ( [ i m ] ) and the observed frequency gives @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then one can use the measured flux density and equations ( [ xm ] ) , ( [ flux ] ) , and ( [ c2 ] ) to obtain @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 , and @xmath57 can be inferred with equation ( [ gamc ] ) . for the bright nir flare observed by ghez et al .",

    "the electron - electron collision time , @xmath63 hrs ( @xmath64 in this case ) , is much longer than any other time scale .",
    "particle - particle collisions , therefore , may be ignored . the electron pressure ( @xmath65 )",

    "the self - comptonization flux density is then given by ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 the low limit of the integral over @xmath75 has been extended from @xmath76 to 0 , which simplifies the formula and introduces a less than @xmath77 error , and @xmath78 .",
    "similarly one can define the spectral index @xmath79 the normalized power spectrum @xmath80 and @xmath81 are depicted by thin lines in figure [ fig1.ps ] ( left ) .    for the above",

    "we therefore do not expect a detectable x - ray flux accompanying this flare . from equations ( [ alphax ] ) and ( [ fx ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the correlation between the nir and x - ray spectroscopic observations . for a given x - ray spectral index , which is a function of @xmath85 , equation ( [ alphax ] ) gives the dependence of the nir flux density on @xmath86 , which determines @xmath13 . for a given x - ray flux density @xmath87 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath86 as a function of @xmath85 by eliminating the @xmath12 terms in the two equations .",
    "this gives @xmath12 as a function of @xmath13 with @xmath86 as a parametric variable .",

    "first , we notice that for weak nir flares with very hard spectra ( to the bottom - right of the figure ) , there is little x - ray emission and that x - ray flares are expected to accompany nir flares with soft spectra ( to the left ) .",
    "these predictions may be readily tested via a statistical study of all the observed flare events ( hornstein et al .",
    "2002 ) and explain why the occurrence rate of nir flares is more than two times greater than that of the x - ray events . for nir flares with very hard spectra ,",
    "@xmath81 is also large ( corresponding to a hard spectrum ) , we expect hard x - ray/@xmath8-ray emission , especially during bright nir flares ( to the top - right ) .",
    "second , brighter x - ray flares ( to the top - left ) tend to have higher nir fluxes and softer nir spectra .",
    "@xmath81 is also small to the left .",
    "we expect little @xmath8-ray emission accompanying weak nir flares with very soft spectra ( to the bottom - left ) .",
    "third , for a given @xmath13 , @xmath87 is roughly proportional to @xmath12 . the spectral index @xmath81 correlates with @xmath91 for low values of @xmath13 , but this correlation almost vanishes for positive @xmath13 s . for low values of @xmath13",
    ", we also expect a correlation between @xmath87 and @xmath81 .    finally , the results are very sensitive to the values of @xmath32 and @xmath51 .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure indicates x - ray flares with @xmath92 .",
    "these are quite different from the lines with @xmath93 . for the referenced nir flare",
    ", the x - ray flux will be detectable with _",
    "chandra _ for @xmath92 .",
    "thus @xmath32 and @xmath51 may be determined accurately with sso .",
    "some of these predictions are shown explicitly in the left panel of figure [ fig2.ps ] , where the solid line is the model spectra of the synchrotron and self - comptonization components for the nir flare studied above .",
    "although there is little x - ray emission , we expect @xmath8-ray emission up to a few mev during the flare .",
    "the model is also applied to the brightest flare observed simultaneously in the nir and x - ray bands by eckart et al . during their multi - wavelength campaign in 2004 . the nir and x - ray fluxes correlated well during the flare and the peak flux densities @xmath60mjy and @xmath94jy .",
    "the spectral indexes of the flare have not been published yet . because the x - ray flux is high , we expect soft nir spectra .",
    "the dotted ( with @xmath95 ) and dashed ( with @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) lines are for this flare .",
    "the right panel shows how the nir and x - ray spectral indexes depend on @xmath32 and @xmath51 .",
    "the cross and square correspond to the dotted and dashed lines in the left panel , respectively .",
    "these show that for given flux densities the spectral indexes are very sensitive to the values of @xmath32 and @xmath51 . because both @xmath32 and @xmath51 are dimensionless quantities , we expect them to be on the order of 1 .",
    "the model therefore predicts that the nir emission has a soft spectrum with @xmath98 .    for the referenced nir flare",
    "the electron acceleration time @xmath99 is shorter than the dynamical time of @xmath100 mins , which is consistent with the observed flare variation time , justifying our usage of the steady - state solution , which , however , may not be valid when @xmath101 , as indicated by the shaded area in figure [ fig1.ps ] ( right ) .",
    "note that for the nir flares with softer spectra we studied before ( liu et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath102 , the steady - state solution therefore may not be applicable . in the most general cases ,",
    "both @xmath36 and @xmath103 are functions of @xmath104 , which are determined by the large scale mhd processes .",
    "time dependent solutions of equation ( [ kinetic ] ) @xmath105 are needed .",
    "however , we do nt expect the electron distribution to be radically different from maxwellian . by introducing a time - dependent @xmath106 , the results here may be readily generalized to incorporate the time evolution of the system and applied to the accretion flow in the quiescent state when advection can be important .",
    "one may also have to take into account the doppler and gravitational effects as the emitting plasma is likely moving on a keplerian orbit near the black hole ( bromley et al .",
    "2001 ; broderick & loeb 2005 ) .",
    "these are beyond the scope of the current investigation .",
    "since the discovery of nir and x - ray flares in sagittarius a * , several models have been proposed ( markoff et al .",
    "2001 ; liu & melia 2002 ) . given the uncertainties in the electron acceleration mechanism , earlier models prescribe either the electron distribution ( yuan et al . 2004 ) or the turbulence spectrum ( liu et al . 2004 ) with several free parameters resulting in all kinds of emission spectra .",
    "in a previous work ( liu et al .",
    "2006 ) , we showed that sagittarius a * s flare activity might be explained with thermal synchrotron and self - comptonization emission and all the model parameters , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath57 , could be readily determined by sso . in this paper",
    "we have shown that the electrons are likely heated by turbulence , which produces a maxwellian distribution and predicts two time - insensitive constraints on the plasma properties making the model testable with sso .",
    "this is the first model that can be tested with current instrument capability .",
    "we have provided general expressions for the emission spectra and demonstrated how properties of the flaring plasma may be inferred from the spectroscopic observations or simultaneous flux measurements in both bands .",
    "the model may therefore provide powerful tools for studying physical processes near the event horizon of black holes .",
    "a time - dependent treatment of this problem will make it possible to compare mhd simulations of the black hole accretion with the observed flare activity in sagittarius a * , which will eventually lead to a measurement of the black hole s spin after the instability is identified and light propagation effects are incorporated properly .",
    "( note that for the referenced nir flare the electron lorentz factor @xmath107 already suggests that the gravitational energy release beyond the last stable orbit of a schwarzschild black hole is not sufficient to power the flare . )",
    "the formulae for the thermal synchrotron and self - comptonization emission are valid so long as optically thin synchrotron emission dominates the radiative output and may therefore be applicable to other astrophysical sources , particularly low - luminosity - agns .",

    "<S> , the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 should remain nearly constant in time . therefore , simultaneous spectroscopic observations in the nir and x - ray bands can readily test the model , which , if proven to be valid , may be used to determine the evolution of the plasma properties during an eruptive event with spectroscopic observations in either band or simultaneous flux density measurements in both bands . </S>",
    "<S> the formulae can be applied to other isolated or confined systems , where electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies by plasma wave turbulence and produce most of the emission via synchrotron processes . </S>"
