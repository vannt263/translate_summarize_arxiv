    "neuropsychological studies on processes occuring in the brain during the motor imagery ( mi ) show that similar parts of the brain are involved in the movement imagination as well as its real performance  @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the movement execution and its imaginary is that in the latter case , the movement performance is blocked at some level of the corticospinal information transfer  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is observed in the sport psychology , where many examinations show that mental exercises have a positive effect on the later movement execution  @xcite .",
    "similarity between the movement imagination and the real movement has been also confirmed by the research , in which healthy patients and patients with motor disabilities have been subjected to the neuropsychological observation  @xcite .",
    "this fact causes that the movement imagination plays an important role as a control signal in the brain - computer interface ( bci )  @xcite , which are dedicated to patients who partly or entirely lost the voluntary muscle contraction such as in the locked - in state  @xcite . the natural way of description both , the execution and the imagination of movement is the event - related desynchronization ( erd ) and the event - related synchronization ( ers )  @xcite .",
    "the spatiotemporal maps of erd / ers inform about the power decrease / increase in the brain activity in mu ( 8@xmath013  hz ) and beta frequency range ( 15@xmath030  hz ) , averaged over trials with respect to the power in a reference time interval  @xcite . in case of experiment with hand movement , erd appears in both mu and beta bands before movement ( imagination ) while ers appears usually in the beta band as the post - movement beta synchronization ( @xmath1rebound ) .",
    "since human somatotopic organization indicates that human limbs are controlled by contralateral brain hemispheres  @xcite , we expect that the most important changes in the brain activity during right hand movement imagination occur mainly at electrode c3 which lies over the left hemisphere of the motor cortex whereas during left hand movement imagination at electrode laying over the right brain hemisphere i.e.  c4 .",
    "flicker noise spectroscopy ( fns ) is a time series analysis method that introduces parameters characterizing the components of stochastic signals in different frequency ranges .",
    "so far the method has been applied to the parameterization of images produced by the atomic force microscopy ( afm )  @xcite , analysis of geological signals measured in seismic areas ( determination of earthquake precursors )  @xcite , determination of electric breakdowns precursors in thin porous silicon films  @xcite , analysis of electric potential fluctuations in electromembrane systems  @xcite .",
    "fns method has been also successfully applied to some problems in medical data processing .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the fns method has been used to analyse the effect of different types of medical treatment on the dynamics of index finger tremor in parkinsonian patients  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite timashev et al . have used fns for the identification of the photosensitive epilepsy .",
    "their results suggest that fns is a promising method of early diagnosis , not only for the photosensitive epilepsy but also for other neurodegenerative diseases such as parkinson s , alzheimer s , huntington s , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and schizophrenia .",
    "these suggestions have been confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been found that the fns parameterization of eeg signal may be used for the diagnosis of schizophrenia at the early stages of its development .    motivated by the successful applications of the flicker - noise spectroscopy in the wide range of medical diagnoses , in the present paper we use this method to find episodes related to the imagination of the right and left hand movement .",
    "we have found that the changes in the fns parameters allows to determine the moment at which the movement imagination occurs .",

    "the analysed signal is separated into following components : low - frequency corresponding to the system specific `` resonances '' and two `` chaotic '' components having the source in irregularities of the signal , appropriately spike and jumps .",
    "the signal under consideration @xmath2 ( in our case @xmath2 corresponds to the eeg signal ) can be written in the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the low - frequency signal formed by resonant component , @xmath5 is the chaotic component formed by spikes ( mostly , the highest - frequency band based on the concept of the dirac @xmath6function ) and @xmath7 is the chaotic component formed by jumps ( mostly , the intermediate - frequency band , `` jumps - like '' based on the concept of the heaviside @xmath8functions ) . according to fns ,",
