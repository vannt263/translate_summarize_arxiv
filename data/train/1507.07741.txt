    "the dynamics of a droplet is one of the most interesting topics in physics  @xcite . in the 19th century , rayleigh investigated the frequency of the fundamental mode of oscillation in droplet shape  @xcite .",
    "since then , there have been several studies on the dynamics of droplets , for example , on the dynamics of the collision of a droplet  @xcite and the wetting of a droplet on a substrate  @xcite .",
    "there have also been many studies on the oscillation of droplet shape under various conditions  @xcite .    through such studies ,",
    "the techniques for levitating a droplet have been improved .",
    "a droplet of the millimeter - to - centimeter scale can be levitated in a static electric field by adding an electric charge to it ; this phenomenon is called electrostatic levitation . by using such a levitated droplet ,",
    "new materials can be synthesized without disturbance by a container wall .",
    "levitated droplets have also been utilized for the measurement of physical properties of liquids such as surface tension and viscosity , without using a container  @xcite .",
    "the surface tension of a liquid can be determined by measuring the characteristic frequency of an infinitesimally small oscillation in the shape of a levitating droplet of the liquid , induced by a small external driving force  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic frequency of oscillation in the @xmath0-mode deformation was also calculated as a natural extension of the ellipsoidal deformation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , busse analyzed the characteristic frequency of a rotating droplet and showed that the frequency is a decreasing function of the rotational speed as long as the amplitude of the deformation is small  @xcite .",
    "this tendency was confirmed experimentally by annamalai _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the amplitude of the oscillation in droplet deformation is not small , it was experimentally observed that the characteristic frequency increased as the amplitude increased in the case without rotation  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude was analytically estimated , and the analytical predictions were found to be consistent with the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "recently , some of the authors of this paper reported their experimental observations on the dependence of the characteristic frequency of oscillatory deformation for a rotating droplet with large amplitude  @xcite .",
    "their results were reproduced numerically through hydrodynamic analyses  @xcite . however , there has been no analytical studies on the characteristic frequency of a rotating droplet with large deformation .    in the present work",
    ", the dependence of the characteristic frequency of oscillatory deformation is investigated for a levitated rotating droplet with large amplitude , based on a simple mechanical model .",
    "the study focuses on a single fundamental mode of deformation , _",
    "i.e. _ , ellipsoidal deformation , and analyzes the properties of the oscillation of the levitated rotating droplet",

    "the droplet is levitated against gravity .",
    "a sinusoidal modulation of the voltage between the two electrodes then induces an oscillation in the ellipsoidal deformation of the droplet .",
    "finally , a torque is exerted on the droplet by applying an acoustic field using two speakers located orthogonally to each other , and the droplet rotates . by measuring the dependence of the frequency on the amplitude and rotational speed",

    "the mechanical model is constructed under the following three assumptions : ( i ) a levitated droplet has an ellipsoidal shape with a constant volume .",
    "( ii ) the fluid inside the droplet moves elastically ; in other words , the fluid particles do not change their configuration .",
    "( iii ) there is no energy dissipation .    here ,",
    "the cylindrical coordinates are adopted such that the symmetric axis corresponds to the @xmath2-axis in fig .",
    "the shape of the ellipsoid is then described as @xmath3 which can also be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath1 are positive , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the volume @xmath6 and surface area @xmath7 of the ellipsoid are given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 . because the volume is conserved , @xmath1 is a function of @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the equivalent - volume radius satisfying @xmath13 . as a result ,",
    "the shape of the ellipsoidal droplet is represented by only one parameter , @xmath5 . in order to consider the deformation from a spherical shape ,",
    "a new nondimensionalized variable @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents a perfectly spherical shape .",
    "in addition , positive and negative @xmath14 correspond to a prolate and an oblate , respectively .",
    "the surface area of the droplet can be expanded with respect to @xmath14 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the terms of the same order as or higher order than @xmath19 .    in order to derive the equation of motion , the lagrangian ,",
    "@xmath20 is considered as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the characteristic direction of the droplet , introduced to describe the droplet rotation .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath20 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the kinetic energy and potential energy , respectively . under the above - mentioned assumption ,",
    "the velocity of a fluid particle located at @xmath25 is written as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the time derivatives of @xmath5 , @xmath1 , and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "it can be confirmed that the flow profile satisfies the navier - stokes equation ( see appendix  [ ap - ns ] ) .",
    "thus , the kinetic energy is calculated as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density of the fluid inside the droplet . to evaluate @xmath24 ,",
    "only the surface energy of the droplet originating from the surface tension is considered : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surface tension of the fluid .",

    "is analyzed for understanding the dynamics of deformation of a rotating droplet .",

    "i.e. _ , for @xmath44 , is calculated as @xmath45 which corresponds to the result obtained by rayleigh  @xcite . when the droplet rotates",
    ", @xmath16 is no longer at equilibrium , but the equilibrium state shifts to @xmath46 , which is explicitly written as @xmath47 where @xmath36 is regarded as a small parameter .",
    "then , the characteristic frequency of the droplet oscillation , @xmath48 , is formulated as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the angular velocity of the droplet oscillation without rotation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath51 .",
    "these results are comparable with those reported in the studies by busse  @xcite and annamalai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .    to consider the nonlinear effect of large deformation on the frequency of oscillatory deformation of the droplet ,",
    "a weakly nonlinear analysis is conducted  @xcite . as eq .",

    "thus , the frequency , @xmath48 , with respect to the angular velocity of the rotation , @xmath36 , and the amplitude of @xmath14 for the oscillation , @xmath56 , can be calculated as @xmath57 the averaged aspect ratio , @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the center positions of the oscillation in the long and short axes , @xmath5 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the time series of @xmath5 and @xmath1 are assumed to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the amplitudes and @xmath66 is the phase shift .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath64 corresponds to @xmath67 .",
    "the center positions can be written explicitly as @xmath68 and @xmath69 therefore , @xmath58 is obtained as @xmath70    tsamopoulos and brown reported the frequency shift due to the large amplitude in the ellipsoidal deformation as @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "this result is different from the one obtained in the above discussion ( eq .  ( [ freq ] ) ) because tsamopoulos and brown investigated the large two - mode deformation from a perfect sphere , whereas we consider an ellipsoidal droplet is considered in this study .",
    "these two approaches provide the same results for infinitesimally small deformations , but they exhibit deviations when large deformations are considered .    next , the results obtained above are compared with a simple spring - bead model . the simplest model that can describe the deformation and rotation is a system with two equivalent small beads connected by a spring on a two - dimensional plane . the mass of each bead is set as @xmath72 , and the potential for the extension of the spring is set as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the distance between the two beads .",

    "the frequency , @xmath78 , is obtained as @xmath79 and the center position of the oscillation , @xmath80 , is obtained as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the angular frequency without rotation , @xmath83 corresponds to the parameter for the frequency of the rotation , and @xmath84 denotes the amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "the center - position shift is calculated as zero when the terms with the same order as @xmath85 and @xmath86 are taken into consideration . from the results ,",
    "the increase in frequency when a droplet is rotating can be considered to be due to the surface tension , which works like a spring .",
    "however , a spring - bead model with a linear spring can not reproduce the center - position shift and the frequency dependence on the amplitude .    by taking into account the nonlinearity of the spring , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath73 is set as @xmath87 , the frequency , @xmath78 , and center - position shift , @xmath80 , are calculated as @xmath88 @xmath89 here , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . by setting @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the spring - bead model can qualitatively reproduce the frequency shift and center - position shift with respect to the amplitude and rotational angular velocity .",
