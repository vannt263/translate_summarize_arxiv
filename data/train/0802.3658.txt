    "the nuclear structure community is currently striving to determine a nuclear energy functional as universal and as accurate as possibile .",
    "extraction of this functional from a more fundamental theory like qcd is of course desirable , and there has been progress along this line . at present , however , it is still unavoidable to work with functionals which depend on free parameters which have to be determined by some fitting procedure .",
    "existing functionals include those based on a covariant formulation  @xcite as well as those based on nonrelativistic formulations . restricting ourselves to the latter case",
    ", we note that a nuclear energy functional can be defined in a general way , without being derived from an underlying hamiltonian in conjunction with a reference state .",
    "however , most of the existing functionals to date are derived from an effective hamiltonian @xmath5 which includes the kinetic energy plus a two - body interaction . in this case , the total energy is the expectation value of @xmath5 over the most general slater determinant @xmath6 .",
    "both zero - range interactions like the one proposed by skyrme at the end of the fifties , and systematically parametrized for hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations since the seventies  @xcite , or finite - range interactions like the gogny force  @xcite , lead to satisfactory descriptions of many nuclear properties .",
    "our tool of choice in the present work is the zero - range skyrme force , from which one can derive a functional @xmath7 $ ] which is a function of _ local _ densities only . for a system that is not symmetric in neutrons and protons",
    ", the total energy depends both on neutron and proton density : @xmath8 = \\int d_3r\\ { \\cal e}(\\rho_n(\\vec r),\\rho_p(\\vec r)).\\ ] ] for the sake of simplicity , we have not indicated that in general the energy depends not only on the spatial densities , but also on gradients @xmath9 , on the kinetic energy densities @xmath10 and on the spin - orbit densities @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 labels @xmath13 )  @xcite .    in infinite matter",
    ", one has a simple expression in terms of the spatial densities only . instead of @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    ", one can use the total density @xmath1 and the _ local _ neutron - proton asymmetry , @xmath16 this quantity should not be confused with the _ global _ asymmetry @xmath17 . in asymmetric matter",
    ", we can make a further simplification on @xmath18 by making a taylor expansion in @xmath19 and retaining only the quadratic term , @xmath20 the first term on the r.h.s . is the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath21 , while the second term defines the main object of the present study , namely the _ symmetry energy _ @xmath0 .",
    "the symmetry energy at saturation @xmath22 is denoted by different symbols in the literature : @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "we stress that eq .",
    "( [ def_sym ] ) is not really a simplification : the coefficient of the term in @xmath26 which should follow , for the skyrme parameter sets employed in this work , is negligible at densities of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "we remind that the pressure of the system can be written in a uniform system as @xmath28 this quantity is evidently related to the density dependence of the energy functional and of the associated symmetry part defined above .",
    "the magnitude and the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath0 are not yet well understood  @xcite . in brief , there exist at present three main research lines aimed at constraining the behavior of the symmetry energy , by using either nuclear structure data , or observables related to heavy - ion collisions , or evidences from the study of neutron stars .    within the realm of nuclear structure , the symmetry energy affects of course all properties of nuclei having neutron excess , including basic ones like masses and radii .",
    "in particular , much attention has been focused on radii since typel and brown  @xcite have noted that the neutron skin thickness @xmath29 is correlated with @xmath30 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the issue is also investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the correlations between the neutron skin thickness and other quantities are discussed .",
    "the experimental accuracy is not sufficient ( so far ) to limit the acceptable range of the neutron skin thickness so that this can constrain a given equation of state ; the parity radius experiment ( prex ) at jlab promises to achieve this task  @xcite .",
    "another interesting way to fix the value of the neutron skin thickness , and extract information on the symmetry energy , is to go through the study of the isovector spin - dipole resonance ( sdr ) sum rule ; also in this case , the experimental difficulties hinder a too definite conclusion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall instead concentrate on the correlation between the symmetry energy and the energy of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "the idea is not new , but in the present work we develop it based on a fully microscopic approach , namely within a self - consistent random phase approximation ( rpa ) scheme to calculate the gdr properties . in the past",
    "@xcite , as well as in recent works  @xcite , the connection with the symmetry energy has been discussed starting from a macroscopic , hydrodynamical description of the gdr ( in particular , using the steinwedel - jensen ansatz which is known to be not fully reliable ) . consequently , we believe that our results are more relevant from a quantitative point of view .",
    "if one tries to constrain the symmetry energy by means of the study of heavy - ion collisions , or by neutron star observables , it is likely that somewhat different physics is involved . in general , the behavior of the symmetry energy on a _ broader _ range of densities is involved . in heavy - ion collisions",
    "maximum densities up to @xmath314 - 5 @xmath27 can be attained  @xcite . on the other hand , data at lower incident energies are believed to be able to constrain the nuclear eos below @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the study of neutron stars , as well , brings in the physics of both low - density and high - density neutron matter ( for a comprehensive review , cf . ref .",
    "a recent study  @xcite which is close in spirit to ours , has examined a large set of skyrme forces , trying to determine those which have a satisfactory behavior in reproducing the neutron - star observables .",
    "one should remark , however , that there are many caveats in the literature against the use of functionals in a density regime far from that in which the functionals are fitted and usually employed .",
    "in particular , we mention here that monte carlo calculations of neutron matter at low density  @xcite show that in this regime @xmath32 is about one half of the fermi energy of the non - interacting neutron gas , and this behavior is not reproduced by any effective mean field functional .",
    "consequently , we do not discuss in detail in the present work the possibility of an overall constraint on the symmetry energy extracted by different kinds of studies .",
    "we briefly discuss in the conclusions to what extent our results can be compared with a few others in the literature .",
    "our starting point will be the hydrodynamical model of giant resonances , proposed by lipparini and stringari  @xcite .",
    "they assume an energy functional which is simplified yet sufficiently realistic , solve the macroscopic equations for the densities and currents , and extract expressions for the moments @xmath33 and @xmath34 associated with an external operator @xmath35 ( @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the strength function associated with @xmath35 ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the well - known `` enhancement factor '' which in the case of skyrme forces is associated with their velocity dependence .",
    "the expression for @xmath34 , in the case of an isovector external operator , includes integrals involving @xmath40 and @xmath35 .",
    "they can be evaluated in a simple way if one assumes the validity of the leptodermous expansion .",
    "we write the volume and surface coefficients of the expansion of @xmath40 as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . by specializing @xmath35 to the isovector dipole case ,",
    "the following expression is obtained ( for details , cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath43}(1+\\kappa)}.\\ ] ] this equation yields values of the centroid energy which are in rather good agreement with those of microscopic rpa calculations .",
    "it turned out to be useful in a previous study  @xcite , in order to constrain directly the parameters of the isovector part of the skyrme interaction . here",
    "we shall use it as a guideline , and try instead to find a quantitative connection between the energy of the gdr and the symmetry energy .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 can be evaluated through the calculation of a semi - infinite nuclear slab .",
    "this has been done , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "their sec .",
    "we do not discuss here the approximations made in the derivation , but we use the fact that the mentioned ratio can be written in terms of the symmetry energy and its derivatives .",
    "if we insert this result into eq .",
    "( [ els ] ) we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46a^{-\\frac{1}{3}}}.\\ ] ] for a given heavy nucleus we can safely consider the first of the three factors under the square root as a constant , since different skyrme forces do not vary widely in their predictions for @xmath47 .",
    "we have evaluated the term @xmath48 at @xmath49 for @xmath50=40 , 124 , 208 , and for a number of skyrme forces .",
    "we have found that it is strongly correlated with the value of @xmath0 in the range @xmath51 @xmath2 .",
    "the specific case @xmath50=208 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_added ] in the case @xmath52 @xmath2 , for which the correlation coefficient is maximum .",
    "although we have not been able to deduce this correlation in an analytic way from the expression of the skyrme functional , this result , together with eq .",
    "( [ els2 ] ) , motivates us to look for a direct correlation between the centroid of the gdr and the symmetry energy , through the quantity @xmath53 for @xmath54 0.1 @xmath2 . in the next section",
    ", we discuss this correlation for @xmath1 = 0.1 @xmath2 in the case of @xmath3pb .",
    "we also discuss in some detail the choice of the skyrme forces that we have employed .",
    "we have obtained results for the gdr in @xmath3pb by using a series of microscopic hartree - fock ( hf ) plus random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations .",
    "skyrme - rpa theory is well known since many years , especially in its matrix formulation .",
    "recently , we have developed a scheme which is fully self - consistent and is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there is no approximation in the residual interaction , in that all its terms are taken into account ( including the two - body spin - orbit and coulomb interactions ) .",
    "the occupied states are determined by solving the hf equations in a radial mesh extending up to 24 fm .",
    "the continuum is discretized since the positive energy states are obtained using box boundary conditions .",
    "particle - hole ( p - h ) configurations which constitute the basis for the rpa matrix equations are included up to typically 60 mev so that the value of @xmath33 is at least 98% of the well - known value obtained from the double commutator . in a few cases , due to the instability of rpa",
    ", we had to resort to tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) calculations but this does not affect significantly our results .",
    "the calculations have been performed for a set of 20 skyrme interactions .",
    "it is well known that more than 100 skyrme parametrizations have been proposed in the literature , including some which have been employed only in limited and specific cases .",
    "it is hard to define in a clear - cut way a `` standard '' subset to be analyzed ; however , we have decided , in the present context , not to consider parametrizations which ( a ) have an associated @xmath55 outside of the range 210 - 270 mev , in keeping with the conclusions reached in ref",
    ".  @xcite by studying the giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) in @xmath3pb , ( b ) reproduce the experimental value of the gdr in @xmath3pb ( 13.46 mev  @xcite ) within @xmath56 2 mev .",
    "we have determined our set including forces proposed by different groups , and at different times . in this sense",
    "the set can be considered representative enough . in the cases in which several forces have been proposed in the same reference",
    ", we have not included more than two forces , in order to avoid a too strong bias .",
    "the forces are listed in table  [ table1 ] ; we also provide the reference from which the parameter sets have been taken , the value for @xmath57 obtained from our rpa calculation , and the values of the quantities @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "( [ frho ] ) ) .",

    "the value of the correlation coefficient is @xmath62 0.909 . before discussing the extraction of the value of the symmetry energy",
    ", we should stress that we have not been able to correlate the gdr simply with @xmath22 ; this may be possible ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) at the price of restricting oneself to a small set of skyrme forces .    we can now make avail of the experimental values of the gdr centroid @xmath63 and of the enhancement factor @xmath39 to deduce the best value of the symmetry energy . while the value of @xmath63 in @xmath3pb has been rather well determined from photoabsorbtion measurements , @xmath64 13.46 mev  @xcite , the value of @xmath39 is less precise . since @xmath65 @xmath39 would be determined if the integrated photoabsorbtion cross section @xmath66 had been mesured up to large energies ( essentially , up to the pion production threshold ) . for obvious experimental difficulties ,",
    "the photoabsorbtion cross section has been measured up to much lower energies ( 26.4 mev in the case at hand , namely @xmath3pb  @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath39 has been already estimated in  @xcite , where it has been stated that @xmath39 should lie , approximately , between 0.2 and 0.3 .",
    "we have checked this in some detail in the following way . from the experimental cross section measured up to the maximum energy of 26.4 mev , that is , from eq .",
    "( [ csk ] ) replacing the upper limit in the integral with 26.4 mev , we have deduced an `` effective '' @xmath39 that we can call @xmath67 .",
    "the skyrme forces which have an associated @xmath67 within the experimental limit are those which have @xmath39 between @xmath68=0.18 and @xmath69=0.26 . in the following",
    ", we have used these values .",
    "our best value for @xmath39 is of course an average between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    at this point",

    "using a representative set of skyrme effective functionals we have found a clear correlation between the energy of the gdr in @xmath3pb and a simple function of the symmetry energy at density @xmath80 @xmath2 and of the enhancement factor @xmath39 associated with the velocity dependence ( and with the effective mass ) of the various functionals . using the well established experimental value of the gdr",

    "more generally , it will be essential to study the interplay between constraints coming from the different kinds of works mentioned in the introduction , which deal with different energy and density regimes .",
    "in fact , a better knowledge of the symmetry part of the nuclear effective functionals , and in particular of its density dependence , would be highly instrumental for the study of systems ranging from exotic nuclei to pure neutron matter ."
