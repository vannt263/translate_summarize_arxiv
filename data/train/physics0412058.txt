    "any communication system can be considered as a particular case of general dynamical system formed by many interacting units .",
    "if the system components are permitted to freely interact without _ strict _ external control , then such unreduced interaction process leads inevitably to complex - dynamical , essentially nonlinear and chaotic structure emergence , or generalised ( dynamically multivalued ) self - organisation @xcite , extending the conventional , basically regular self - organisation concept .",
    "the usual technology and communication practice and paradigm rely , however , on very strong human control and totally regular , predictable dynamics of controlled systems and environment , where unpredictable events can only take the form of undesirable failures or noise .",
    "growing volumes and complication of communication system links and functions lead inevitably to increasing probability of undesirable deviations from the pre - programmed regular behaviour , largely compromising its supposed advantages . on the other hand , such increasingly useful properties as intrinsic system creativity and autonomous adaptability to changing environment and individual user demands should certainly involve another , much less regular and more diverse kind of behaviour . in this paper we analyse these issues in a rigorous way by presenting the unreduced , nonperturbative analysis of an arbitrary system of interacting entities and",
    "show that such _ unreduced interaction process _ possesses the natural , dynamically derived properties of chaoticity , creativity ( autonomous structure formation ability ) , adaptability , and exponentially high efficiency , which can be consistently unified into the totally universal concept of _ dynamic complexity _ @xcite .",
    "this concept and particular notions it unifies represent essential extension with respect to respective results of the usual theory always using one or another version of perturbation theory that strongly reduces real interaction processes and leads inevitably to regular kind of dynamics ( even in its versions of chaoticity ) .",
    "we shall specify these differences in our analysis and demonstrate the key role of unreduced , interaction - driven complexity , chaoticity and self - organisation in the superior operation properties , as it has already been demonstrated for a large scope of applications @xcite .",
    "we start , in sect .",
    "2 , with a mathematical demonstration of the fact that the unreduced interaction process within _ any _ real system leads to intrinsic , genuine , and omnipresent _ randomness _ in the system behaviour , which can be realised in a few characteristic regimes and leads to the _ universally _ defined _ dynamic complexity_. we outline the change in strategy and practice of communication system construction and use , which follows from such unreduced analysis of system interactions .",
    "the _ universality _ of our analysis is of special importance here , since the results can be applied at various _ naturally entangled _ levels of communication system operation . in particular , we demonstrate the complex - dynamic origin of the huge , _ exponentially high efficiency growth _ of the unreduced , causally random system dynamics , with respect to the standard , basically regular system operation ( sect .",
    "3 ) . finally , the dynamically derived , _ universal symmetry , or conservation , of complexity _ is introduced as the new guiding principle and tool of complex system dynamics that should replace usual , regular programming",
    ". the _ paradigm of intelligent communication systems _ is thus specified , since we show also @xcite that the property of _ intelligence _ can be consistently described as high enough levels of the unreduced dynamic complexity .",
    "this  intelligent communication \" is the most complete , inevitable realisation , and in fact a synonym , of the truly _ autonomous _ communication dynamics and its expected properties .",
    "we begin with a general expression of multi - component system dynamics ( or many - body problem ) , called here _ existence equation _ , fixing the fact of interaction between the system components , and generalising various model equations : @xmath0 } } \\right\\}\\psi \\left ( q \\right ) = e\\psi \\left ( q \\right)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the  generalised hamiltonian \" of the @xmath2-th system component in the absence of interaction , @xmath3 is the degree(s ) of freedom of the @xmath2-th component ( expressing its  physical nature \" ) , @xmath4 is the ( generally arbitrary ) interaction potential between the @xmath2-th and @xmath5-th components , @xmath6 is the system state - function , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the eigenvalue of the generalised hamiltonian , and summations are performed over all ( @xmath9 ) system components .",
    "the generalised hamiltonian , eigenvalues , and interaction potential represent a suitable measure of dynamic complexity defined below and encompassing practically all  observable \" quantities ( action , energy , momentum , current , etc . ) at any level of dynamics .",
    "therefore ( [ eq:1 ] ) can express the unreduced interaction configuration at any level of communication network of arbitrary initial structure .",
    "it can also be presented in a particular form of time - dependent equation by replacing the generalised hamiltonian eigenvalue @xmath8 with the partial time derivative operator ( for the case of explicit interaction potential dependence on time ) .",
    "one can separate one of the degrees of freedom , e.g. @xmath10 , corresponding to a naturally selected , usually  system - wide \" entity , such as  embedding \" configuration ( system of coordinates ) or common  transmitting agent \" : @xmath11 + } \\sum\\limits_{l > k}^n { v_{kl } \\left ( { q_k , q_l } \\right ) } } \\right\\}\\psi \\left ( { \\xi , q } \\right ) = e\\psi \\left ( { \\xi , q } \\right),\\ ] ] where now @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "we try now to approach the solution of the  nonintegrable \" system of equations ( [ eq:5 ] ) with the help of the generalised effective , or optical , potential method @xcite , where one expresses @xmath34 through @xmath35 from the equations for @xmath34 using the standard green function technique and then inserts the result into the equation for @xmath36 , obtaining thus the _ effective existence equation _ that contains _ explicitly _ only  integrable \" degrees of freedom ( @xmath37 ) @xcite : @xmath38 where the operator of _ effective potential ( ep ) _ , @xmath39 , is given by @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 are complete sets of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a _ truncated _ system of equations : @xmath44\\psi _ n \\left ( \\xi   \\right ) + \\sum\\limits_{n ' \\ne n } { v_{nn ' } \\left ( \\xi   \\right ) } \\psi _ { n ' } \\left ( \\xi   \\right ) = \\eta _",

    "the measured quantity , generalised as structure density @xmath52 , is obtained as the state - function squared modulus , @xmath53 ( for  wave - like \" complexity levels ) , or as the state - function itself , @xmath54 ( for  particle - like \" structures ) @xcite .",
    "since the ep expression in the effective problem formulation ( [ eq:9])-([eq:11 ] ) depends essentially on the eigen - solutions to be found , the problem remains  nonintegrable \" and formally equivalent to the initial formulation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "however , it is the effective version of a problem that leads to its unreduced solution and reveals the nontrivial properties of the latter @xcite .",
    "the most important property of the unreduced interaction result ( [ eq:9])-([eq:15 ] ) is its _ dynamic multivaluedness _ meaning that one has a _ redundant _ number of different but individually complete , and therefore _ mutually incompatible _ , problem solutions , each of them describing an _ equally real _ system configuration .",
    "we call each such locally complete solution ( and real system configuration ) _ realisation _ of the system and problem",
    ". plurality of system realisations follows from the unreduced ep expressions due to the nonlinear and self - consistent dependence on the solutions to be found , reflecting the physically real and evident plurality of possible combinations of interacting eigen - modes @xcite .",
    "it is important that dynamic multivaluedness emerges only in the unreduced problem formulation , whereas the standard theory , including ep method applications ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the scholar  science of complexity \" ( theory of chaos , self - organisation , etc . ) , resorts invariably to one or another version of perturbation theory ,",
    "whose approximation , used to obtain an  exact \" , closed - form solution , totally  kills \" redundant solutions by eliminating just those nonlinear dynamical links and retains _ only one _ ,  averaged \" solution , usually expressing only _ small _ deviations from initial , pre - interaction configuration .",
    "this _ dynamically single - valued _ , or _",
    "unitary _ , problem reduction forms the basis of the whole canonical science paradigm .",
    "since we have many _ incompatible _ system realisations that tend to appear from the same , driving interaction , we obtain the key property of _ causal , or dynamic , randomness _ in the form of permanently _ changing _ realisations that replace each other in the _ truly random _ order .",
    "therefore dynamic multivaluedness , rigorously derived simply by unreduced , correct solution of a real many - body ( interaction ) problem , provides the _ universal dynamic origin _ and _ meaning _ of the _ omnipresent , unceasing _ randomness in the system behaviour , also called _",
    "( dynamical ) chaos _ ( it is essentially different from any its unitary version , reduced to an  involved regularity \" or _ postulated _ external  noise \" ) .",
    "this means that the genuine , truly complete _ general solution _ of an arbitrary problem ( describing a _ real _ system behaviour ) has the form of _ dynamically probabilistic _ sum of measured quantities for particular system realisations : @xmath55 where summation is performed over all system realisations , @xmath56 is their number ( its maximum value is equal to the number of system components , @xmath57 ) , and the sign @xmath58 designates the special , dynamically probabilistic meaning of the sum described above .",
    "it implies that any measured quantity ( [ eq:16 ] ) is _ intrinsically unstable _ and its current value _ will _ unpredictably change to another one , corresponding to another , _",
    "randomly _ chosen realisation .",
    "such kind of behaviour is readily observed in nature and actually explains the living organism behaviour @xcite , but is thoroughly avoided in the unitary theory and technological systems ( including communication networks ) , where it is correctly associated with linear  noncomputability \" and technical failure ( we shall consider below this _ limiting _ regime of real system dynamics ) .",
    "therefore the universal dynamic multivaluedness thus revealed by the rigorous problem solution forms the fundamental basis for the transition to  bio - inspired \" and  intelligent \" kind of operation in artificial , technological and communication systems , where causal randomness can be transformed from an obstacle to a qualitative advantage ( sect .",
    "the rigorously derived randomness of the generalised ep formalism ( [ eq:9])-([eq:16 ] ) is accompanied by the _",
    "dynamic definition of probability_. because the elementary realisations are equivalent in their  right to appear \" , the dynamically obtained , _ a priori probability _ , @xmath59 , of an elementary realisation emergence is given by @xmath60 however , a real observation may fix uneven groups of elementary realisations because of their multivalued self - organisation ( see below ) .",
    "therefore the dynamic probability of observation of such general , compound realisation is determined by the number , @xmath61 , of elementary realisations it contains : @xmath62 an expression for _ expectation value _ , @xmath63 , can easily be constructed from ( [ eq:16])-([eq:18 ] ) for statistically long observation periods : @xmath64 it is important , however , that our dynamically derived randomness and probability need not rely on such  statistical \" , empirically based result , so that the basic expressions ( [ eq:16])-([eq:18 ] ) remain valid even for a _ single _ event of realisation emergence and _ before _ any event happens at all .    the realisation probability distribution can be obtained in another way , involving _ generalised wavefunction _ and _ born s probability rule _ @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction describes the system state during its transition between  regular \" ,  concentrated \" realisations and constitutes a particular ,  intermediate \" realisation with spatially extended and  loose \" ( chaotically changing ) structure , where the system components transiently disentangle before forming the next  regular \" realisation .",
    "the intermediate , or  main \" , realisation is explicitly obtained in the unreduced ep formalism @xcite and provides , in particular , the causal , totally realistic version of the quantum - mechanical wavefunction at the lowest ,  quantum \" levels of complexity . the  born probability rule \" , now also causally derived and extended to any level of world dynamics , states that the realisation probability distribution is determined by the wavefunction values ( their squared modulus for the  wave - like \" complexity levels ) for the respective system configurations .",
    "the generalised wavefunction ( or distribution function ) satisfies the universal schrdinger equation ( sect .",
    "3 ) , rigorously derived from the dynamic quantization of complex dynamics @xcite , while born s probability rule follows from the _ dynamic _  boundary conditions \" mentioned in connection to the state - function expression ( [ eq:15 ] ) and actually satisfied just during each system transition between a  regular \" realisation and the extended wavefunction state . note also that it is this  averaged \" , weak - interaction state of the wavefunction , or ",
    "main \" realisation , that actually remains in the dynamically single - valued , one - realisation  model \" and  exact - solution \" paradigm of the unitary theory , which explains both its partial success and fundamental limitations .    closely related to the dynamic multivaluedness is the property of _ dynamic entanglement _ between the interacting components , described in ( [ eq:15 ] ) by the dynamically weighted products of state - function components depending on various degrees of freedom ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "it provides a rigorous expression of the tangible _ quality _ of the emerging system structure and is absent in unitary models .",
    "the obtained _ dynamically multivalued entanglement _ describes a  living \" structure , permanently changing and probabilistically _ adapting _ its configuration , which provides a well - specified basis for  bio - inspired \" technological solutions . the properties of dynamically multivalued entanglement and adaptability are further amplified due to the extended _ probabilistic fractality _ of the unreduced general solution @xcite , obtained by application of the same ep method to solution of the truncated system of equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) used in the first - level ep expression ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "we can now consistently and universally define the unreduced _ dynamic complexity _",
    ", @xmath66 , of any real system ( or interaction process ) as arbitrary growing function of the total number of _ explicitly obtained _ system realisations , @xmath67 , or the rate of their change , equal to zero for the unrealistic case of only one system realisation , @xmath68 .",
    "suitable examples are provided by @xmath69 , generalised energy / mass ( proportional to the temporal rate of realisation change ) , and momentum ( proportional to the spatial rate of realisation emergence ) @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear now that the whole _",
    "dynamically single - valued _ paradigm and results of the canonical theory ( including its versions of  complexity \" and _ imitations _ of  multi - stability \" in _ abstract _ , mathematical  spaces \" ) correspond to exactly _ zero _ value of the unreduced dynamic complexity , which is equivalent to the effectively zero - dimensional , point - like projection of reality in the  exact - solution \" perspective .",
    "correspondingly , _ any _ dynamically single - valued  model \" is strictly regular and _ can not _ possess any true , intrinsic randomness ( chaoticity ) , which should instead be introduced artificially ( and inconsistently ) , e.g. as a _",
    "regular _  amplification \" of a  random \" ( by convention ) _ external _  noise \" or  measurement error \" . by contrast",
    ", our unreduced dynamic complexity is practically synonymous to the equally universally defined and genuine _ chaoticity _ ( see above ) , since multiple system realisations , appearing and disappearing only in the _ real _ space ( and _ forming _ thus its tangible , changing structure @xcite ) , are redundant ( mutually incompatible ) , which is the origin of _ both _ complexity and chaoticity .",
    "the genuine dynamical chaos thus obtained has its complicated internal structure ( contrary to the ill - defined unitary  stochasticity \" ) and always contains _ partial regularity _ , which is dynamically , inseparably entangled with truly random elements .",
    "the universal dynamic complexity , chaoticity , and related properties involve the _ essential , or dynamic , nonlinearity _ of the unreduced problem solution and corresponding system behaviour .",
    "it is provided by the naturally formed dynamical links of the developing interaction process , as they are expressed in the ( eventually fractal ) ep dependence on the problem solutions to be found ( see ( [ eq:9])-([eq:11 ] ) ) .",
    "it is the _ dynamically emerging _ nonlinearity , since it appears even for a formally  linear \" initial problem expression ( [ eq:1])-([eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:5 ] ) , whereas the usual , mechanistic  nonlinearity \" is but a perturbative approximation to the essential nonlinearity of the unreduced ep expressions .",
    "the essential nonlinearity leads to the irreducible _ dynamic instability _ of any system state ( realisation ) , since both are determined by the same dynamic feedback mechanism .",
    "universality of our description leads , in particular , to the unified understanding of the whole diversity of existing dynamical regimes and types of system behaviour @xcite .",
    "one standard , limiting case of complex ( multivalued ) dynamics , called _ uniform , or global , chaos _",
    ", is characterised by sufficiently different realisations with a homogeneous distribution of probabilities ( i.e. @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 for all @xmath72 in ( [ eq:18 ] ) ) and is obtained when the major parameters of interacting entities ( suitably represented by frequencies ) are similar to each other ( which leads to a  strong conflict of interests \" and resulting  deep disorder \" ) .",
    "the complementary limiting regime of _ multivalued self - organisation , or self - organised criticality ( soc ) _ emerges for sufficiently different parameters of interacting components , so that a small number of relatively rigid , low - frequency components  enslave \" a hierarchy of high - frequency and rapidly changing , but configurationally similar , realisations ( i.e. @xmath73 and realisation probability distribution is highly inhomogeneous ) .",
    "the difference of this extended , multivalued self - organisation ( and soc ) from the usual , unitary version is essential : despite the rigid _ external _ shape of the system configuration in this regime , it contains the intense  internal life \" and _ chaos _ of permanently changing  enslaved \" realisations ( which are _ not _ superposable unitary  modes \" ) .",
    "another important advance with respect to the unitary  science of complexity \" is that the unreduced , multivalued self - organisation unifies the extended versions of a whole series of separated unitary  models \" , including soc , various versions of  synchronisation \" ,  control of chaos \" ,  attractors \" , and  mode locking \" .",
    "all the intermediate dynamic regimes between those two limiting cases of uniform chaos and multivalued soc ( as well as their multi - level , fractal combinations ) are obtained for intermediate values of interaction parameters .",
    "the point of transition to the strong chaos is expressed by the _",
    "universal criterion of global chaos onset _ : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the introduced _",
    "parameter , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 are energy - level separations and frequencies for the inter - component and intra - component motions , respectively . at @xmath80 one",
    "has the externally regular multivalued soc regime , which degenerates into global chaos as @xmath75 grows from 0 to 1 , and the maximum irregularity at @xmath81 is again transformed into a multivalued soc kind of structure at @xmath82 ( but with a  reversed \" system configuration ) .",
    "one can compare this transparent and universal picture with the existing diversity of separated and incomplete unitary criteria of chaos and regularity . only the former provide a real possibility of understanding and control of communication tools of arbitrary complexity , where more regular regimes can serve for desirable direction of communication dynamics , while less regular ones will play the role of efficient search and adaptation means .",
    "this combination forms the basis of any  biological \" and  intelligent \" kind of behaviour @xcite and therefore can constitute the essence of the _ intelligent communication paradigm _ supposed to extend the now realised ( quasi- ) regular kind of communication , which corresponds to the uttermost limit of soc ( @xmath83 ) . while the latter _ inevitably _ becomes inefficient with growing network sophistication ( where the chaos - bringing resonances of ( [ eq:20 ] )",
    "_ can not _ be avoided any more ) , it definitely lacks the  intelligent power \" of unreduced complex dynamics to generate meaning and adaptable structure development .",
    "the _ dynamically probabilistic fractality _ of the system structure emerges naturally by the unreduced interaction development itself @xcite .",
    "it is obtained mathematically by application of the same ep method ( [ eq:9])-([eq:14 ] ) to solution of the truncated system of equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) , then to solution of the next truncated system , etc . , which gives the irregular and _ probabilistically moving _ hierarchy of realisations , containing the intermittent mixture of global chaos and multivalued soc , which constitute together a sort of _ confined chaos_. the total realisation number @xmath56 , and thus the power , of this autonomously branching interaction process with a _ dynamically parallel _ structure grows _ exponentially _ within any time period .",
    "it can be estimated in the following way @xcite .",
    "if our system of inter - connected elements contains @xmath84  processing units \" , or  junctions \" , and if each of them has @xmath85 real or  virtual \" ( possible ) links , then the total number of interaction links is @xmath86 . in most important cases",
    "@xmath9 is a huge number : for both human brain and genome interactions @xmath9 is greater than @xmath87 , and being much more variable for communication systems , it will typically scale in similar  astronomical \" ranges",
    ". the key property of _ unreduced , complex _",
    "interaction dynamics , distinguishing it from any unitary version , is that the maximum number @xmath56 of realisations actually taken by the system ( also per time unit ) and determining its real  power \" @xmath88 ( of search , memory , cognition , etc . )",
    "is given by the number of _ all possible combinations of links _",
    ", i.e. @xmath89 any unitary , sequential model of the same system ( including its _ mechanistically _  parallel \" and  complex \" modes ) would give @xmath90 , with @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 thus , for @xmath93 we have @xmath94 , which is indeed a  practical infinity \" , also with respect to the unitary power of @xmath95 .",
    "these estimates demonstrate the true power of complex ( multivalued ) communication dynamics that remains suppressed within the unitary , quasi - regular operation mode dominating now in man - made technologies .",
    "the huge power values for complex - dynamical interaction correlate with the new _ quality _ emergence , such as _ intelligence _ and _ consciousness _",
    "( at higher levels of complexity ) @xcite , which has a direct relation to our _ intelligent _ communication paradigm , meaning that such properties as _ sensible _ , context - related information processing , personalised _ understanding _ and autonomous _ creativity _ ( useful self - development ) , desired for the new generation networks , are inevitable _ qualitative _ manifestations of the above  infinite \" power .",
    "everything comes at a price , however , and a price to pay for the above qualitative advantages is rigorously specified now as irreducible _ dynamic randomness _ , and thus unpredictability of operation details in complex information - processing systems .",
    "we only rigorously confirm here an evident conclusion that _ autonomous _ adaptability and genuine _ creativity _ exclude any detailed , regular , predictable pre - programming in principle .",
    "but what then can serve as a guiding principle and practical strategy of construction of those qualitatively new types of communications networks and their  intelligent \" elements ?",
    "we show in our further analysis of complex - dynamic interaction process that those guiding rules and strategy are determined by a general law of complex ( multivalued ) dynamics , in the form of _ universal symmetry , or conservation , of complexity _",
    "this universal  order of nature \" and evolution law unifies the extended versions of all ( correct ) conservation laws , symmetries , and postulated principles ( which are causally derived and realistically interpreted now ) .",
    "contrary to any unitary symmetry , the universal symmetry of complexity is _ irregular _ in its structure , but always _ exact _ ( never  broken \" ) .",
    "its  horizontal \" manifestation ( at a given level of complexity ) implies the actual , dynamic symmetry between realisations , which are really taken by the system , constituting the system dynamics ( and evolution ) and replacing the abstract  symmetry operators \" .",
    "therefore the conservation , or symmetry , of system complexity totally determines its dynamics and explains the deep  equivalence \" between the emerging , often quite dissimilar and chaotically changing system configurations @xcite .",
    "another ,  vertical \" manifestation of the universal symmetry of complexity is somewhat more involved and determines emergence and development of different levels of complexity within a real interaction process .",
    "system  potentialities \" , or ( real ) power to create new structure at the very beginning of interaction process ( before any actual structure emergence ) can be universally characterised by a form of complexity called _ dynamic information _ and generalising the usual  potential energy \" @xcite . during the interaction process development , or structure creation , this potential , latent form of complexity",
    "is progressively transformed into its explicit ,  unfolded \" form called _ dynamic entropy _ ( it generalises kinetic , or heat , energy ) .",
    "the universal _ conservation of complexity _ means that this important transformation , determining every system dynamics and evolution , happens so that the sum of dynamic information and dynamic entropy , or _ total complexity _",
    ", remains unchanged ( for a given system or process ) .",
    "this is the absolutely universal formulation of the symmetry of complexity , that includes the above  horizontal \" manifestation and , for example , extended and unified versions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics ( i.e. conservation of energy and its permanent degradation ) .",
    "it also helps to eliminate the persisting ( and inevitable ) series of confusions around the notions of information , entropy , complexity , and their relation to real system dynamics in the unitary theory ( thus , really expressed and processed  information \" corresponds rather to a particular case of our generalised dynamic entropy , see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "it is not difficult to show @xcite that the natural , universal measure of dynamic information is provided by the ( generalised ) action @xmath96 known from classical mechanics , but now acquiring a much wider , essentially nonlinear and causally complete meaning applicable at any level of complexity .",
    "one obtains then the universal differential expression of complexity conservation law in the form of generalised hamilton - jacobi equation for action @xmath97 : @xmath98 where the _ hamiltonian _ , @xmath99 , considered as a function of emerging space coordinate @xmath100 , momentum @xmath101 , and time @xmath102 , expresses the unfolded , entropy - like form of differential complexity , @xmath103 ( note that the discrete , rather than usual continuous , versions of derivatives and variable increments here reflect the naturally quantized character of unreduced complex dynamics @xcite ) . taking into account the dual character of multivalued dynamics , where every structural element contains permanent transformation from the localised ,  regular \" realisation to the extended configuration of the intermediate realisation of generalised wavefunction and back ( sect .",

    "<S> dynamics of arbitrary communication system is analysed as unreduced interaction process . </S>",
    "<S> the applied generalised , universally nonperturbative method of effective potential reveals the phenomenon of dynamic multivaluedness of competing system configurations forced to permanently replace each other in a causally random order , which leads to universally defined dynamical chaos , complexity , fractality , self - organisation , and adaptability . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the origin of huge , exponentially high efficiency of the unreduced , complex network dynamics and specify the universal symmetry of complexity as the fundamental guiding principle for creation and control of such qualitatively new kind of networks and devices . </S>"
