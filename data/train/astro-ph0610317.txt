    "for those outside of an observatory , the question naturally arises as to why we would put all of this time and effort into documenting the numbers of papers written by users of a particular facility .",
    "after all , our job as librarians is to gather , organize , and make available the scientific literature , not to simply _ count _ it .",
    "however , in these days of competing demands for funding , those who supply that funding want to assure that they are putting their money into the more productive projects .",
    "the institutions for their part want to know that those using their facilities are not merely collecting data , but are also putting it to good use by publishing their results in the refereed literature and making their data available for other scientists to use . finally ,",
    "scientists compete for time on heavily over - subscribed instruments . who actually gets to observe is usually decided by a tac  time allocation committee and those providing the funding as well as the institutions want to know that the tac is selecting the best of the proposals and `` best ''",
    "is usually characterized as the most publishable , that which produces meaningful scientific output .",
    "traditionally , bibliography compilers ( usually librarians ) reviewed all incoming journals for papers using a particular facility .",
    "this was a tedious , but relatively consistent task with little difference in methodology among different journals .",
    "there was a steady pace of work that could be easily integrated into the library s traditional workflow .",
    "in addition , once one became familiar with the standard abbreviations and paper styles ( i.e. , most journal papers have an `` observations '' or `` data used '' section ) , the task went fairly quickly . on the other hand , it was also easy to miss papers , especially because authors are inconsistent in supplying the `` required '' acknowledgements",
    ".    given the advances in technology over the past decade or so , one may now screen electronic tables of contents or individual journal websites to find the relevant papers .",
    "additionally , there are a variety of aggregators of journal metadata , such as the astrophysics data system ( ads ) , web of science , or inspec , so one may search many journals simultaneously .",
    "the advantages to electronic searches are that , assuming the search is crafted sufficiently well , fewer papers are missed and the selection of which papers need to be reviewed more carefully is accelerated .",
    "the libraries at eso , nrao , and st sci each conducted separate experiments",
    ". nrao tracked the source of additions to their bibliography for five months . during that time , 92% of the papers added came from electronic tables of contents ( tocs ) , 6.5% from author notifications or checking the print journals on arrival , and 1.5% from ads alerts . at st sci ,",
    "emailed tocs were searched for relevant articles and then rechecked when the paper versions arrived .",
    "we then reversed the procedure and searched the paper first , followed after a suitable delay searching the electronic version .",
    "this was done for a five - month period at the end of which we performed a `` canned '' search in the ads and compared the results against the bibliography .",
    "the comparison showed 66.8% of a total of 522 papers were found in both the ads and the bibliography ; 2.6% were in the ads but not in the bibliography , and 30.6% in the bibliography but not the ads .",
    "there were also ten false drops from the ads plus seven unrefereed papers returned as refereed .",
    "eso checked their traditional acquisition method against the ads for all of 2005 and found 62.4% ( of 585 papers ) in common , 36.9% not in the ads search , and less than 1% in the ads that the traditional method had missed .",
    "eso also noted 108 false drops in the ads search , including 32 unrefereed conference papers cited as refereed by the ads .",
    "of the remaining false drops , 47 could be traced to ambiguous acronyms and/or search terms , a problem endemic to automated searches unfortunately .",
    "eso then did a further study on a sample of 40 papers that did not turn up in the ads search and learned that the mention of eso facilities had been in the full text of the articles for 42.5% and that the eso footnote did not make it into the ads indexing for 45% of the papers .",
    "to put it succinctly , we are not there yet .",
    "each journal has its own unique methodology for searching content , some more useful for this kind of task than others .",
    "for instance , we rated the _ astrophysical journal _ and _ monthly notices of the royal astronomical society _ as the most `` user - friendly '' since both allow for complex searches in the full - text of individual issues . _",
    "mn _ also highlights the search terms within the paper , speeding the process of deciding whether a specific paper should be included or not . at the opposite end of the spectrum",
    "is _ astronomy & astrophysics _ whose full - text searches are currently limited to 100 or fewer hits , and the _ publications of the astronomical society of japan _ ,",
    "whose html articles are broken into sections so one can not search the whole article at one time .",
    "( we should point out that when this study was first done , _",
    "a&a _ presented their results with oldest first , so that for an observatory with many papers , one would never get to the current ones .",
    "they have now reversed the presentation so the latest are retrieved first . ) in addition to these very user - unfriendly sites , there are those that are merely frustrating and time - consuming because they allow for complex searching , but not at the issue level or those whose complex searches are limited to the metadata ; i.e. , searching only the title , abstract , and keywords . at the end of this article",
    "is a table that summarizes the searching advantages and limitations of the major journals in the field .",
    "anyone familiar with astronomical bibliography is aware of the huge impact the ads has had on the way astronomers ( and astronomy librarians ) do research and will naturally be wondering why that system is nt used exclusively for tasks such as this . unfortunately , as the numbers in section 3 demonstrate , searching just the ads has severe limitations .",
    "these include the fact that the ads has no full - text searching of current journals .",
    "one also can not limit one s search to a specific issue but even more problematic for this kind of work , we learned that the more complex the search expression , the more likely the ads would deliver irrelevant hits , each of which has to be examined separately .",
    "there is little doubt that as electronic publishing matures ( one must remember that the first e - journal in astronomy appeared as recently as 1996 ) and as searching techniques advance that the ads will become increasingly useful for compiling telescope bibliographies , especially if one can be content with a completeness rate of 85 - 90% rather than the ideal 100% .",
    "in summary , we can say that e - screening for papers from a particular observatory works best when few hits are expected , the journal has full - text searching capabilities , the title in question has a large number of papers , but relatively few hits , and/or the number of search terms ( that is telescope / instrument names ) are few .",
    "manual screening , on the other hand , still needs to be used in cases where the journal does nt allow for complex searching , the journal is likely to have many relevant papers , and/or electronic searching is only possible within the title , abstract , and keywords .",
