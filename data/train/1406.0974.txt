    "for a proper description of the propagation of low - energy ( @xmath2 ) cosmic ray protons in the vicinity of a cosmic ray accelerator with general momentum loss , the transport equation @xmath5 has to be solved , where @xmath6 is the differential number density of cosmic ray protons , @xmath7 is the scalar diffusion coefficient , @xmath8 denotes the laplace operator , @xmath9 is the momentum loss rate , and @xmath10 is a source function which is adapted to the astrophysical object under consideration .",
    "the low energy of the cosmic ray protons allows for a scalar diffusion coefficient because then there is no preferred whereas in a scenario with highly relativistic motion , an anisotropic diffusion coefficient is required . in @xcite , this transport equation is solved analytically for an arbitrary source function . the green s function @xmath11 of eq .",
    "( [ transp_eq_large ] ) , i.e. , the fundamental solution for a source term consisting of dirac distributions @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this solution is convoluted with the source function @xmath15 of an astrosphere or a wind bubble , yielding the differential number density of cosmic ray protons at any position @xmath16 at time @xmath17 with momenta lower than the injection momentum @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 the momentum - dependent component of the source function @xmath15 can be obtained from observational gamma ray data for a hadronic formation scenario of the gamma rays @xcite , while the spatial dependence is constructed reflecting the geometry of the source region , e.g. , a spherical ( shell ) volume with a constant emission over a specific period of time .",
    "the ionisation rate of molecular hydrogen induced by low - energy cosmic ray protons can be calculated following @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the differential flux of cosmic ray protons , @xmath22 is the direct ionisation cross - section of molecular hydrogen , and @xmath23 denotes the number of secondary ionisation events per primary ionisation @xcite .",
    "the differential flux can be derived from the differential cosmic ray proton number density ( eq .  [ convol_g_q ] ) by differentiating with respect to the cosmic ray particle kinetic energy @xmath24 and subsequent multiplication with the effective cosmic ray particle speed , which is given by a superposition of diffusion and the relativistic , kinematic motion .",
    "this total speed is also used to link the space and time components , leading to a description which assumes all particle speeds to be equal to the statistic expectation value .",
    "then , the time since the injection , which is usually unknown , is not required .    in this model ,",
    "the effects of magnetic fields , particularly magnetic focussing and magnetic mirroring , are not accounted for . taking them into consideration , @xcite found that in dense molecular clouds magnetic fields lead to a net decrease of the ionisation rate induced by cosmic rays by a factor of , on average , 34 .",
    "in less dense regions , like swept up stellar ejecta at the shocks of astrospheres or stellar wind bubbles , the decrease of the cosmic ray - induced ionisation rate is lower .",
    "in @xcite , a method taking not just ionisation induced by cosmic ray protons , but also by heavier nuclei into account was introduced using the bethe ",
    "bloch approximation for the direct ionisation cross - section @xcite and a correction factor for the differential cosmic ray flux in eq .",
    "( [ ion - pado ] ) , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the atomic number of the cosmic ray particles heavier than hydrogen with the corresponding charge number @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the relative abundance of cosmic ray particles of atomic number @xmath26 with respect to cosmic ray protons . for relative abundances detected in the solar system @xcite ,",
    "the correction was calculated in @xcite and @xcite as @xmath29 . at the acceleration regions ,",
    "the composition may well differ . in order to obtain data with as little influence from the sun as possible ,",
    "observational data of the cosmic ray composition taken during solar minima , when the impact of the sun on the cosmic ray flux is minimal , should be used .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the correction is done for observational data from the solar minima in 1977 @xcite or in 1988 @xcite .",
    "the resulting corrections are @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( in agreement with the results in @xcite ) , respectively , indicating that , on the one hand , the impact of the sun on the composition of the cosmic ray spectrum at low energies can not be neglected and , on the other hand , that the composition of the cosmic ray spectrum at the acceleration regions shows significantly larger abundances of nuclei with @xmath32 than the corresponding abundances in the solar system . adapting the momentum loss @xmath9 , which for cosmic ray protons is dominated by coulomb losses and adiabatic deceleration in the relevant kinetic energy range of @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to cosmic ray particles with @xmath34 , the solution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_sol ] ) can also be used to describe the propagation of those heavier cosmic ray particles , resulting in an even more accurate calculation of the cosmic ray - induced ionisation rate .",
    "besides cosmic ray - induced ionisation , photoionisation is the other process capable of efficient ionisation of ambient matter with soft x - rays and uv radiation being particularly efficient .",
    "consequently , photoionisation needs to be exceeded by ionisation induced by hadronic low - energy cosmic rays in order to attribute enhanced ionisation rates to those cosmic rays via the suggested correlation study for astrospheres or stellar wind bubbles with nearby clouds acting as a target for both photons and cosmic rays .",
    "therefore , spatially resolved spectral measurements of photon fluxes are important for estimates of the photoionisation rate .",
    "the attenuation of photon fluxes due to traversed matter can be described by means of the beer  lambert law @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the differential photon flux , @xmath37 is the differential photon flux at the surface of a cloud located near the source , and @xmath38 is the optical depth inside the cloud .",
    "for the special case of matter distributed homogeneously with density @xmath39 , the optical depth can be expressed in terms of the distance from the source region as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total photoabsorption cross - section .",
    "this formula leads to an overestimate of the photon flux at large distances from the source region , because it does not account for scattering , which would in effect increase the distance the photons travel .",
    "hence , the energy attenuation of the photon flux within the cloud is underestimated .",
    "the photoionisation rate of molecular hydrogen can be calculated following @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fraction of the photon energy absorbed by ambient matter leading to ionisation @xcite , and @xmath44 is the ionisation potential of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the integral describes the total energy deposition by the absorbed photons per hydrogen nucleus . a parametrised description of the total photoabsorption cross - section @xmath45 is provided as an empirical , broken power - law fit to experimental data .",
    "the main issue computing the photoionisation rate is obtaining a solid estimate of the photon flux at low energies , i.e. , @xmath46 . since the total photoabsorption cross - section increases toward lower photon energies , the corresponding photons can contribute significantly to the photoionisation rate , depending on spectral shape of the photon flux in this energy range .",
    "hence , observing the low - energy photon fluxes is an important task in estimating the photoinduced ionisation .",
    "particularly the uv component of the photon flux is very efficient in ionising ambient hydrogen close to the surface of a cloud and , thus , has a great impact on the photoionisation rate .",
    "in contrast to the examination of , e.g. , supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds , a solid estimate of the low - energy photon fluxes in astrospheres can be provided much more reliably via the classification of the star and usage of the typical corresponding black - body radiation spectrum . since in most situations",
    "there is only very little information about the uv domain of the photon flux , which is a major issue for the estimate of photoionisation rates , astrospheres are promising targets for the suggested correlation study in this regard .",
    "the total ionisation rate , i.e. , the sum of the photoinduced and the cosmic ray - induced ionisation rates , can be used as input for astrochemistry models in order to compute signatures indicating an enhanced ionisation rate , e.g. , in the form of rotation - vibration lines of molecular ions formed by ion - driven chemistry , detectable with instruments like alma . while the ionisation rate is not directly detectable , its impact on ambient matter , e.g. , diffuse molecular clouds in star - forming regions containing wind bubbles of massive stars , or interstellar matter swept up by stellar winds , results in the formation of molecular ions that are otherwise not formed in observable abundances . among the molecular ions formed in these environments , is especially suitable as a tracer of ionisation , because its formation scheme is rather simple and directly linked to the ionisation rate of hydrogen ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an example for a tool to calculate rotation - vibration lines of molecular ions is the radiative transfer code radex @xcite .",
    "it allows rapid computation of , e.g. , rotation - vibration emission line intensities of molecules , including , as was shown in @xcite for molecular clouds near supernova remnants , based on input parameters such as the abundances of several atomic and molecular species , the electron number density , and a few others .",
    "furthermore , it provides different geometries and the option to include a background radiation field .    some of the molecules and molecular ions are best seen in absorption , so their rotation - vibration lines need to be detected as absorption features in the spectra of background sources .",
    "while for supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds it is difficult to find an adequate ( sufficiently bright ) background source with known photon spectrum , this does not pose a problem for astrospheres , since the classification of the star provides a reasonable estimate of the local radiation field at the corresponding wavelengths in the ir- and submm - domain .",
    "another method to determine the ionisation rate via observations is to look for the ratio of the abundances of certain molecular species , e.g. , the @xmath47 ratio , but any other ratio of molecular abundances sensitive to the ionisation rate can be chosen as well . a detection of either these ratios or predicted rotation - vibration lines , whether in emission or absorption , would be a strong hint at an enhanced ionisation rate .    in the supernova remnant complexes",
    "ic  443 , w28 , and w51c , enhanced ionisation rates were observed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively , via abundances , ammonia ( ) emission lines , and the @xmath47 ratio , respectively , indicating that the detection of enhanced ionisation rates can be performed with current - generation telescopes . with alma ,",
    "even more detailed studies of the substructure of interesting objects are possible .",
    "a correlation study of both gamma rays formed via proton - proton interactions of cosmic ray protons of kinetic energies @xmath48 with ambient matter and ionisation signatures induced by cosmic ray protons of lower energies can be used to examine cosmic ray acceleration in many different astrophysical sources , such as supernova remnants , astrospheres , and wind bubbles of massive stars . to this end",
    ", the position - dependent ionisation profiles induced by photons and cosmic ray protons can be calculated in order to determine the total ionisation rate , which in turn leads to the formation of molecular ions .",
    "these ions can be observed via their rotation - vibration line spectra with current - generation telescopes , among which alma is particularly well - suited due to its high spatial resolution , while the detection of the gamma rays can be done with instruments such as fermilat , h.e.s.s . , and cta .",
    "observational evidence of enhanced ionisation rates which can only be explained by cosmic rays can help establish astrospheres and wind bubbles of massive stars as sources of ( sub)tev cosmic rays , leading to a better understanding of these objects .",
