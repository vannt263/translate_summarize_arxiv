    "@xcite shown the importance of the the double intrinsic charm as the leading production mechanism .",
    "however this kind of physics is very limitedly accessible at the current collider experiments .",

    "the existence of a non - perturbative intrinsic heavy quark component in the nucleon is a rigorous prediction of qcd .",
    "intrinsic charm and bottom quarks are in the wavefunction of a light hadron  from diagrams where the heavy quarks are multiply attached by gluons to the valence quarks  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the frame - independent light - front wavefunction of the light hadron has maximum probability when the fock state is minimally off - shell .",
    "this occurs when all of the constituents are at rest in the hadron rest frame and thus have the same rapidity @xmath4 when the hadron is boosted .",
    "equal rapidity occurs when the light - front momentum fractions @xmath5 of the fock state constituents are proportional to their transverse mass : @xmath6 ; i.e. when the heavy constituents have the largest momentum fractions .",
    "this feature underlies the brodsky , hoyer , peterson , and sakai ( bhps ) model for the distribution of intrinsic heavy quarks  @xcite .    in the bhps model the wavefunction of a hadron in qcd",
    "can be represented as a superposition of fock state fluctuations , e.g. @xmath7 ... , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as above , is light quark content .",
    "when the projectile interacts with the target , the coherence of the fock components is broken and the fluctuation can hadronize .",
    "the intrinsic heavy flavor fock components are generated by virtual interactions such as @xmath10 where gluon couple to two or more projectile valence quarks .",
    "the probability to produce such @xmath11 fluctuations scales as @xmath12 relative to leading - twist production .",
    "following @xcite the general formula for the probability distribution of an n - particle intrinsic heavy flavor fock state as a function of @xmath13 and transfer momentum @xmath14 can be written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is mass of the initial hadron .",
    "the probability distribution for the production of two heavy quark pairs is @xmath17 if we are interested in calculation of the @xmath2 distribution then we can simplify the formula with replacement @xmath18 with the effective mass @xmath19 and neglect the mass of the light quarks @xmath20 this model assumes that the vertex function in the intrinsic charm wavefunction is relatively slowly varying ; the particle distributions are then controlled by the light - cone energy denominator and phase space .",
    "the fock states can be materialized by a soft collision in the target which brings the state on shell .",
    "the distribution of produced open and hidden charm states will reflect the underlying shape of the fock state wavefunction .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate the doubly intrinsic heavy approach for the production of the doubly heavy states in the feynman-@xmath2 region at the fixed - target experiment at lhc at @xmath3 gev .",
    "in the frame of the quark - hadron duality the production cross section of the doubly heavy state can be estimated as the production of a heavy quark pair with small invariant mass between the heavy quark production threshold and the threshold of production open heavy flavor hadrons . in case of the doubly charmed baryons @xmath22 where @xmath23 is c - quark mass",
