    "it is now generally accepted that the universe is currently undergoing a period of accelerated expansion . the most popular approach to modeling",
    "the current epoch is to postulate a new energy component of the universe , dark energy , which has negative pressure and hence drives the acceleration .",
    "possible dark energy candidates include the cosmological constant @xcite , which has well known fine tuning issues , quintessence fields ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) and elastic dark energy @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to modify the theory of gravity , and there have been a number of attempts to construct late time accelerating solutions to the gravitational field equations by modifying gravity at large distances / late times .",
    "one such class of models are found by considering a gravitational action that contains an arbitrary function @xmath0 of the ricci scalar . the first modified gravity model to be considered introduced quadratic terms into the gravitational action @xcite .",
    "such models can give rise to early - time inflationary solutions to the gravitational field equations , where the hubble parameter is initially @xmath1 , and slowly rolls towards a stable minkowski vacuum state .",
    "modified gravity models which yield late - time acceleration have been considered recently .",
    "an important example is the cddtt model @xcite , for which @xmath2 .",
    "this function has a de - sitter vacuum solution to the field equations , which might be associated with the current epoch of the universe with a suitable tuning of the mass scale @xmath3 .",
    "however , it has been shown that this model can not satisfy local gravity constraints @xcite , and also has an instability @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cddtt model , a number of modified gravity functions have been proposed which give rise to late time acceleration @xcite , and some progress has been made in understanding general properties of these models , for example the behaviour of metric perturbations @xcite and the cosmological evolution of generic @xmath0 functions @xcite have been considered .",
    "any @xmath0 model must satisfy certain conditions in order to exclude the possibility of ghost degrees of freedom and other instabilities .",
    "these conditions are @xmath4 , which ensures that there are no ghost degrees of freedom in the model , and @xmath5 , which prevents instabilities from arising in the early universe @xcite .",
    "it seems also sensible to impose @xmath6 , which ensures that there is no cosmological constant , and @xmath7 for large @xmath8 , since we want any modification to gravity to only become significant at late times .",
    "in addition to these conditions , it has been shown that if a standard matter era ( for which @xmath9 ) is to be a fixed point then further conditions must be satisfied @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of models have been studied in the literature which satisfy the above constraints , at least for @xmath10 .",
    "specifically the following functions have been considered @xcite ,    @xmath11 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the current vacuum curvature of the universe , @xmath13 are dimensionless constants , and @xmath14 . in ref.@xcite , the @xmath15",

    "the model @xmath18 represents a modification to general relativity that is a power law in @xmath8 , whilst @xmath19 contains exponential corrections .",
    "these models both have late - time accelerating epochs , and can satisfy local tests of gravity .",
    "they can also satisfy the conditions discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "although the models ( @xmath16,@xmath20 ) possess many desirable features , an additional issue has arisen recently with regards to their suitability as viable gravitational models @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been suggested that if we look for solutions to the gravitational field equations that are perturbations around known general relativistic solutions , then the ricci scalar oscillates over very short timescales , and the amplitude of these oscillations will increase without bound to the past @xcite . if true , this presents us with a number of issues , amongst which are that the small perturbation will become much larger than the general relativistic solution at some time in the past , violating the perturbative assumption , and @xmath8 will become negative at some finite time .",
    "such phenomena would most likely lead to significant problems in reproducing the standard cosmology .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the two models ( @xmath16,@xmath20 ) in detail .",
    "we find that since @xmath8 oscillates over such small timescales , the linearized analysis presented in refs.@xcite will not necessarily yield a solution that is indicative of the full solution for all times .",
    "we then solve the gravitational field equations numerically and semi - analytically and show that the ricci scalar undergoes asymmetric oscillations , and will drift away from the general relativistic limit .",
    "we note that non - linear oscillations have been considered in @xmath0 models previously , see ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section we consider the modified gravity action    @xmath21    which yields the following field equations    @xmath22 f'(r ) = { t_{\\mu\\nu } \\over m_{\\rm pl}^{2 } } , \\ ] ]    @xmath23    where primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath8 , @xmath24 is the energy momentum tensor and @xmath25 is the reduced planck mass .    the hss and ab models can be expanded as    @xmath26    for @xmath27 , where @xmath12 acts as a small ` cosmological constant ' ( although there is no true constant in these models since globally @xmath6 ) .",

    "finally , we note that we will frequently make use of the notation @xmath48 , which is the general relativistic solution to the field equations @xmath49 .",
    "in particular during the matter era we have @xmath50 , and during the radiation era @xmath51 .",
    "in this section , we review the perturbative analysis that has been used in refs.@xcite to derive approximate solutions to the gravitational field equations for the ab and hss models .",
    "the full field equations are a set of non - linear , fourth order differential equations for the scale factor , and solving these equations directly is difficult ( although see for example ref.@xcite for an attempt to do so for the cddtt model ) . the approach taken in this section is to look for solutions to the field equations that are perturbations around known general relativistic solutions , that is we look for a solution to ( @xmath52 ) of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is some small perturbation .",

    "the field equation ( @xmath58 ) is an inhomogeneous , second order differential equation for @xmath55 .",

    "however , in fig.[fig:1 ] we have not exhibited the actual oscillations of @xmath8 explicitly , since they are of too high frequency to be resolved , and so have only presented @xmath48 and the upper and lower envelopes of the oscillations .    from fig.[fig:1",
    "] , we see that the lower envelope appears to have a turning point , indicating that in this approach after this time the oscillatory component @xmath55 will come to dominate over @xmath48 , and hence the ricci scalar will become negative at some point in the past .      in refs .",
    "@xcite , a similar analysis has been considered for the model @xmath80 .",

    "we find similar behaviour for @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , @xmath55 undergoes rapid oscillations , and both the amplitude and frequency of these oscillations increases to the past .",
    "since the amplitude of @xmath55 grows without bound as @xmath92 , it follows that @xmath55 will violate the condition @xmath93 at some point in the past , at which point the perturbative analysis will break down . beyond this",
    ", we can not assume that @xmath88 is a solution to the gravitational field equations .",
    "this oscillatory behaviour presents us with a number of problems .",
    "the first is that since @xmath55 grows to the past , it will eventually satisfy @xmath94 . beyond this point",
    ", @xmath8 will periodically be negative , and when @xmath8 is negative we can no longer use the expansion @xmath95 .",
    "this is a problem particularly relevant for the hss model , since for @xmath96 there will be a point at which @xmath97 , which is a singular point in the field equations . the second problem associated with the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath55",
    "is that the frequency grows to the past without bound .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite that this issue can be ameliorated by introducing an additional term @xmath98 into the action , where @xmath99 is a mass scale .",
    "this will provide a cut off in the frequency growth at @xmath100 .",
    "+     +     +",
    "in this section , we first show that the above linearized analysis is only valid over a very limited range of @xmath8 , and that the gravitational field equations are generically non - linear . to see this , we first write ( @xmath52 ) as    @xmath101    where we have expanded the function @xmath95 , and neglected the term @xmath102 .",
    "both of these assumptions are acceptable if we consider a regime where @xmath36 . in section [ sec : am1 ] , we linearized this equation in @xmath55 , and in doing so we neglected the term @xmath103 , which was assumed to be second order .",
    "however , since @xmath55 oscillates with high frequency @xmath104 , it follows that the term @xmath105 will not remain small , since it will grow like @xmath106 to the past .",
    "hence the accuracy of the above linearized analysis will begin to reduce when @xmath103 is of the same order as @xmath107 . beyond this point , we can no longer use the linearized equation for @xmath55 , and we must include these non - linear terms .    for the ab model , we can explicitly show the range of @xmath55 over which the linearized analysis is valid . to see this , we consider the expansions ( @xmath108-@xmath109 ) . as an example , we take @xmath110 , which was expanded as @xmath111 . for the ab model",
    "this reads @xmath112 .",
    "we compare this to our actual function @xmath113 , given by @xmath114 , and we see that the expansion of @xmath115 is only valid in the very limited range @xmath116 . once this condition is violated , we can no longer use the linearized equation ( @xmath58 ) for @xmath55 . since in general we will have @xmath117 , then it follows that the linearized analysis will break down for the ab model long before @xmath118 .",
    "the above reasoning suggests that although the linearized analysis successfully predicts the oscillatory behaviour of these models , we can only trust the solution for a limited range of @xmath8 , and beyond this the field equation for @xmath8 is inherently non - linear .",

    ", we do not consider solutions to the field equations that are perturbations around the general relativistic ricci scalar , but rather look for full numerical solutions to ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , it is not just a second order differential equation for @xmath8 , but rather a fourth order non - linear equation for the scale factor @xmath65",
    ". therefore we will treat ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath120 and @xmath121 as a set of coupled non - linear differential equations for @xmath8 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we stress that we are not making the assumption that @xmath124 , and the only assumption that we will make is that during the matter era @xmath125 .",
    "we do so because we wish to compare the full numerical results obtained here with the results of the linearized analysis of the section [ sec : am1 ] , where the vacuum curvature was neglected .",
    "we have checked that introducing the vacuum curvature does not significantly effect our results , since we can absorb it into the energy momentum tensor .",
    "we look for solutions to these equations for two sets of initial conditions .",
    "first we perturb @xmath8 initially from its general relativistic limit , and compare the full numerical solution to the linearized analysis of the previous section .",

    "the only assumptions made are that @xmath134 and that ignoring the @xmath12 term will not significantly effect our results , which is valid throughout our numerical calculation .",
    "it is clear that @xmath135 is not a solution of these equations , and hence the hss model will not exactly mimic general relativity .",
    "as we will see , even if we set the initial conditions such that @xmath8 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are initially equal to their general relativistic values , if we evolve this model backwards in time then they will deviate from @xmath49 .",

    "we have found that we can only evolve the ricci scalar over a small range of @xmath137 . as we will see in the next section , this is because the ricci scalar will generically evolve to a singularity at some finite point in the past .",
    "for now , we will ignore this singular behaviour and solve ( @xmath131 ) for @xmath8 over a small dynamical range .",
    "the ricci scalar , obtained using a stiff differential equation solver , is shown in fig.[fig:3 ] .",

    "these initial conditions are the same as those chosen in the previous section , so that we can compare the full solution found here to the solution found using the linearized approximation @xmath88 . in fig.[fig:3 ] , we have exhibited the envelope of the oscillations of the ricci scalar , and the general relativistic solution @xmath48 . from the envelope functions , we see asymmetric oscillations of @xmath8 about @xmath48 .",
    "we note that the solution obtained in this section is significantly different to the one obtained in the linearized analysis , shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
