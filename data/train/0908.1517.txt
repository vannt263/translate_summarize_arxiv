    "in the current renaissance  @xcite of research related to zinc oxide ( zno ) , most attention is focused on the material s near - band - edge optical properties for the development of new / improved ultraviolet ( uv ) emitters and detectors .",
    "in addition to its direct , wide band gap of @xmath0 , an exciton binding energy of @xmath1 is frequently cited as a primary motivation to investigate zno .",
    "however , zno has also proven viable as a green / monochrome phosphor in electron - excited  @xcite and photon - excited  @xcite applications .",
    "this highly efficient `` green band '' luminescence typically peaks around @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and essentially spans the entire visible spectrum in a manner well matched to the human eye response .",
    "the exponentially growing market for inexpensive , environmentally friendly solid - state lighting has made zno - based phosphors particularly compelling .",
    "although the general consensus is that a lattice defect ( possibly an oxygen or zinc vacancy ) rather than an impurity is responsible for green band luminescence ,  @xcite zno lattice imperfections in general and the microscopic origin of zno green emission in particular remain a matter of debate .",
    "resolving the influence of these defects on the optical properties of zno will allow intentional engineering of zno for either uv or green / white optoelectronic applications .    toward that end",
    ", we have previously reported on the remarkable enhancement of green band emission from doped zno powders and nanostructures following uv excitation .",
    "@xcite in those investigations , it was found that the emission strength dramatically increased after sulfur doping and annealing but decreased with increasing excitation intensity @xmath4 .",
    "it was also found that the external quantum efficiency dropped from @xmath5 for micron - sized powders to @xmath6 for nanometer - sized wires , a confirmation that nanostructuring increases the probability of competing nonradiative relaxation .",
    "@xcite although qualitatively compelling , the model@xcite proposed by shalish underestimated the amount of green defect emission from these sulfur - doped , annealed zno nanostructures by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "much work remains to understand the relationship between defects and optical performance .",
    "here we introduce a new experimental tool  namely comparative ultrafast one- and two - photon excitation spectroscopy  that , when combined with traditional photoluminescence ( pl ) , photoluminescence excitation ( ple ) spectroscopy , and quantum efficiency ( qe ) measurements , provides a more complete and quantitative understanding of the relationship between excitonic and defect emission with competing nonradiative recombination processes .",
    "because one - photon excitation creates excitons near the particle s surface while two - photon excitation creates excitons throughout the particle s volume , this technique provides unprecedented insights into exciton diffusion , the effects of reabsorption , and the spatial distributions of radiative and nonradiative traps .",
    "we use this technique to compare the pl spectra and recombination lifetimes in unannealed , nanometer - sized zno powders and annealed , micrometer - sized zno : zn powders . unlike sulfur - doped zno ,",
    "the uv and green defect band emission features are well - resolved in these materials , allowing each emission process to be investigated separately . one- and two - photon excitation",
    "is used to measure the external quantum efficiency , systematically quantifying how the uv and green emission strengths depend on the spatial distribution and lifetimes of radiative and nonradiative traps .",
    "these experimental investigations indicate a competition among three excitonic relaxation pathways : radiative recombination , nonradiative recombination , and transfer to a green defect emission site .",
    "this competition is reflected in a simple rate equation model that uses the measured relaxation rates to predict the quantum efficiencies and suggest how defect engineering could improve them .",
    "the zno samples were derived from commercially available zno powder ( 99.999% , alfa aesar ) .",
    "a reference sample , hereafter referred to as `` unannealed zno , '' underwent no additional treatment .",
    "a second sample ( `` annealed zno '' ) was prepared by sealing a portion of the unannealed zno in a quartz tube under vacuum and firing it for one hour at 1000 in a horizontal tube furnace .",
    "this procedure is similar to the commercial production of `` zinc - doped zno , '' or zno : zn ( to denote an excess of zinc atoms or a deficiency of oxygen atoms ) , where zno powder is annealed between @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    sem images ( fig .  [ figpowdersem ] )",
    "indicate that the unannealed powder particles have a median diameter of 340 , whereas the annealed powder exhibits a much larger median size of @xmath8 . as discussed in ref .  , the annealed zno sample exhibits optical properties virtually identical to those of typical zno : zn phosphor powders ; i.e. , the photoluminescence spectrum is dominated by highly efficient , defect - related emission centered at @xmath9 with a full width at half - maximum of @xmath10 . in the unannealed zno sample ,",
    "this `` green band '' defect emission is almost three orders of magnitude weaker than the ultraviolet , near - band - edge emission .",
    "sem images of ( a ) unannealed zno powder and ( b ) annealed zno powder .",
    "both scale bars correspond to @xmath11.,width=302 ]    the samples were prepared for optical characterization by mixing them with methanol , dropping the mixtures onto microscope slides , and allowing the methanol to evaporate .",
    "@xcite optical excitation was provided by @xmath12 pulses from a tunable 1optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) . above - gap",
    "excitation at 3.84(323 ) was generated using the fourth harmonic of the opa s signal . due to the large absorption coefficient of zno at this excitation energy ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "creation of electron - hole pairs occurs primarily near the surface of the particles ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "@xcite the samples were also excited below the band gap at 1.92(646 ) using the second harmonic of the opa s signal . in this case ,",
    "electron - hole pairs are generated via two - photon absorption , but the carriers have the same initial energy distribution as for one - photon excitation since the two - photon excitation energy is half that of the one - photon excitation . assuming a two - photon absorption coefficient of @xmath15 for zno ,  @xcite the effective penetration depth of two - photon excitation is @xmath16 ; thus , the carriers are generated uniformly throughout the volume of the nanometer- and micrometer - scale particles . the incident laser fluences were approximately @xmath17 and @xmath18 for one - photon ( `` surface '' ) and two - photon ( `` volume '' ) excitation , respectively .",
    "after taking into consideration the actual number of photons absorbed by the samples ( 96% and 8% for one - photon and two - photon excitation , respectively  @xcite ) and the fact that two photons of volume excitation lead to a single photoexcited electron - hole pair , the effective fluence for both one - photon and two - photon excitation is @xmath19 .",
    "this fluence corresponds to a photogenerated carrier density of approximately @xmath20 .",
    "time - integrated photoluminescence ( tipl ) spectra were measured using a pair of off - axis parabolic mirrors to collect and focus the pl into a fused silica optical fiber that was coupled to a 30spectrometer with ccd detector ( acton / princeton instruments ) .",
    "time - resolved pl ( trpl ) was measured using the same collection optics in conjunction with an analog streak camera ( hamamatsu c4334 ) .",
    "the streak camera s time window and resolution were 10and 140ps .",
    "for acquisition of near - band - edge emission .",
    "external quantum efficiency measurements were made under the same excitation conditions using a 10diameter integrating sphere , as described previously .",
    "@xcite all pl spectra were corrected for the spectral sensitivities of the various optical paths and detectors , and unless otherwise specified , all measurements were performed at room temperature .",
    "after photoexcitation of an exciton population in zno , luminescence is emitted at energies @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the exciton energy .",
    "free exciton luminescence occurs at @xmath23 , and lower - energy emission occurs through longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon - assisted exciton annihilation ( hereafter denoted x-@xmath24lo for involvement of @xmath25 lo phonons ) .",
    "@xcite depending on their energy , these luminescence photons are subject to reabsorption through various mechanisms ( band - to - band absorption , exciton resonance , below - gap `` urbach '' tail absorption , etc . ) .",
    "the probability of reabsorption is described by the strength of the absorption spectrum @xmath26 . on average",
    "the photon will reach the sample surface without undergoing reabsorption if it originates within the optical escape depth @xmath27 of the surface . whenever a reabsorption event does occur ,",
    "a free electron - hole pair is re - created .",
    "this electron - hole pair is then subject anew to the possibilities of exciton formation and/or energy transfer to `` traps '' ( either radiative or nonradiative ) .",
    "quantifying @xmath26 for the powder samples in this work is difficult because the samples are optically thick and highly scattering .",
    "we have adopted a technique based on pl excitation ( ple ) spectroscopy to estimate the absorption spectrum .",
    "the underlying assumption of this technique is that the ple spectrum of near - band - edge luminescence  specifically the x-2lo transition  effectively maps out the exciton and band - to - band absorption resonances because many combinations of phonon wave vectors satisfy the momentum conservation rule associated with 2-lo - assisted exciton annihilation .",
    "therefore , the properties of this luminescence feature are representative of the entire photoexcited exciton population .",

    "@xcite the excitation profiles for exciton luminescence and green luminescence are almost identical .",

[ figpleopticalescape](a ) ) .",
    "@xcite the enhancement in absorption at @xmath35 , which is below the exciton resonance @xmath36 ,  @xcite was observed previously in the ple of zno nanorods and was attributed to enhanced exciton - phonon coupling at room temperature .",

    "the insight provided by comparing pl and trpl upon one- and two - photon excitation arises from the differing absorption depths and corresponding photoexcited exciton distributions . because of the large absorption coefficient of zno for @xmath38 , one - photon excitation primarily generates carriers ( and therefore excitons ) within @xmath39 of the particle surface .",
    "two - photon excitation with @xmath40 generates the same number of carriers , but over the entire thickness of the sample . in this case",
    ", many excitons will form within the sample at distances exceeding the optical escape depth .",
    "now , exciton polaritons with @xmath41 propagate through the sample and undergo one reabsorption event every @xmath42 on average .",
    "the only exciton polaritons that have a high probability of escaping as luminescence photons are those generated within @xmath43 of the particle surface .",
    "the rest will mostly be reabsorbed and lost through nonradiative recombination in the bulk of the sample .",
    "excitons which undergo phonon - assisted recombination in the bulk of the material will yield photons experiencing reabsorption every @xmath44 .",
    "the probability of escape is higher for the x-2lo transition ( @xmath45 ) compared to the x-1lo and x-0lo transitions ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively ) because the escape depth is larger .",
    "@xcite but again , the most likely fate for electron - hole pairs formed by reabsorption is nonradiative recombination .",
    "differences in the one- and two - photon pl and trpl signals arise from the different recombination processes active in each spatial distribution of excitons . for one - photon / surface excitation , the effective carrier concentration is reduced at the surface due to nonradiative surface recombination .",
    "@xcite therefore , for one - photon excitation we expect the near - band - edge luminescence to originate near the particle surface , to undergo minimal reabsorption , and to experience competition primarily from nonradiative _ surface _ recombination . for two - photon / volume excitation",
    ", the measured uv luminescence signal will consist primarily of luminescence from the small fraction of excitons photogenerated near the surface of the sample if the density of _ bulk _ nonradiative traps is significant . because the absorption coefficient is negligible at visible wavelengths",

    "the annealing process has also created a high density of green - emitting defects whose presence correlates with increased reabsorption of near - band - edge luminescence . for volume excitation of the annealed zno",
    ", the smaller value of @xmath82 suggests a reduction in nonradiative surface recombination : of the excitons created in the bulk of the material which then propagate toward the surface , a large fraction of them is absorbed by green defects before reaching the surface , where nonradiative surface recombination would have occurred ( and in which case the value of @xmath82 would have been larger ) .",
    "the time - resolved near - band - edge pl spectra for annealed zno are shown in fig .",

    "as was the case for unannealed zno , the differences in one - photon and two - photon pl spectra are maintained on every time scale .",
    "the lack of time - evolving spectral distributions again suggests that the pl differences are due to reabsorption and distinct surface / bulk nonradiative trap distributions acting upon the initial spatial distributions of carriers , rather than exciton trapping or surface  bulk diffusion determining the dynamics .",
    "finally , we turn our attention to the broadband , defect - related green pl band shown in fig .",
    "[ figgrpltrt ] . the spectrally integrated efficiency @xmath93 is higher for surface excitation , which confirms our previous assertion that the majority of green - emitting defects are spatially concentrated in the near - surface region of the particle and are excited by one - photon excitation .",

    "thus , the small reduction in green qe for volume compared to surface excitation confirms that 1 ) the green - emitting traps are located primarily in the surface region of the particle and 2 ) the annealing process reduces the density of bulk nonradiative traps . because the green - emitting defects are concentrated near the sample surface , the main recombination channel competing with green pl is nonradiative surface recombination .",

    "none of these distributions can be inferred with high spatial resolution from the optical data presented here .",
    "even if these distributions were known , the convolution of these trapping effects with the geometry of the particles and the penetration depth of the exciting laser requires a complex model considering spatial , temporal , and spectral evolutions of the luminescence signals .",
    "however , for a qualitative understanding of how the various radiative and nonradiative recombination processes contribute to the observed quantum efficiencies , it is instructive to consider a simple , single - particle rate equation model for the exciton population . it is assumed that excitons are created and thermalized on a time scale much shorter than the luminescence decays so that processes leading to the thermalized exciton population may be neglected .",
    "this assumption is valid for the excitation fluence used to generate the data in secs .",

    "the annealing process has drastically reduced the density of bulk nonradiative traps so that nonradiative recombination within this region will be ignored . in the case of two - photon excitation",
    ", carriers are photogenerated uniformly throughout the volume element .",
    "after initial generation of an exciton population from these photoexcited carriers , the only processes under consideration are depletion of excitons via radiative recombination and creation of excitons via reabsorption .",
    "the exciton population @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 the initial exciton population created by the laser is given by the initial condition @xmath98 ( proportional to the laser fluence ) , and @xmath99 is the intrinsic radiative exciton lifetime .",
    "exciton creation via reabsorption is described by the @xmath100 term .",
    "we assume that the rate of exciton creation due to reabsorption is proportional to the existing exciton population according to an unknown factor @xmath101 : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the effective exciton lifetime that takes into account reabsorption .",

    ".  @xcite we require @xmath106 so that the exciton population asymptotically decays with time rather than increases .",
    "therefore , reabsorption slows down the radiative decay process , but it does not change the single - exponential nature of the decay . the effective lifetime @xmath107 can be approximated as the slow component of the uv trpl data because this component corresponds to exciton luminescence originating in the bulk of the material . for the case of two - photon excitation under consideration here , @xmath108 ( table  [ tabuvparams ] ) .",
