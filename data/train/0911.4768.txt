    "the standard cosmological model has successfully explained the observed statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and the large scale structure ( lss ) traced by galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the model usually assumes that the primordial density / temperature / curvature fluctuations follow gaussian statistics .",
    "recently , however , possible deviations from standard gaussian statistics has attracted great attention with rapid progress in observational techniques .",
    "it offers an opportunity to access cosmological information beyond traditional power spectrum analysis .",
    "many recent works have discussed the constraints and future detectability of possible deviations from gaussianity through the observations of cmb and lss ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    according to the inflationary scenarios ,",
    "primordial curvature perturbations are generated during the accelerated phase of cosmic expansion .",
    "the simplest inflation models , in which the inflation takes place with the slow - roll single scalar field that has a canonical kinetic structure , generally predicts a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations , and a small departure from gaussianity . on the other hand ,",
    "a variety of inflation models that produce a large non - gaussianity has been recently proposed ( see @xcite for a review ) . among these",
    ", the models with large non - gaussianity generated by non - linear dynamics on super - horizon scales can have a generic prediction for non - gaussian properties . denoting a gaussian field by @xmath3 ,",
    "the bardeen s curvature perturbation during the matter era is characterized as @xcite : @xmath4 this type of non - gaussianity , described as a local function of the gaussian field , is often called _ local type _ non - gaussianity , and the leading - order coefficient @xmath2 , which controls the strength of non - gaussianity , has information on the generation mechanisms for non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "although the current constraint on the parameter @xmath2 from cmb data is @xmath5 ( @xmath6c.l . ) @xcite and it is still consistent with gaussian ( @xmath7 ) , the constraint will be tightened by the on - going cmb experiment , planck @xcite .",
    "as standard inflation models generally predict @xmath8 , detection of large non - gaussianity immediately implies the non - standard mechanism for generation of primordial curvature perturbations .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on how this type of non - gaussianity alters the statistical properties of lss .",
    "let us first define the power spectrum of mass density fluctuations assuming isotropy and homogeneity : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the fourier transform of the density contrast , while @xmath11 represents the dirac delta function .",
    "if the density field follows gaussian statistics , its power spectrum determines all the statistical properties .",
    "next we define the bispectrum of a mass density field : @xmath12 since this is the lowest - order non - vanishing quantity in the presence of non - gaussianity , the bispectrum is naively expected as the best measure for non - gaussianity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , however , the _ galaxy _ or _ halo _ power spectrum has been reconsidered in the presence of local and/or equilateral type primordial non - gaussianity both analytically and numerically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the matter power spectrum or bispectrum is not a direct observable , and the real measurement of lss gives _ galaxy _ power spectrum or bispectrum , as defined similarly to equations ( [ eq : pow_def ] ) and ( [ eq : bis_def ] ) .",
    "since galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter distribution , the information of @xmath2 is imprinted in a different manner : a new contribution coming from the primordial non - gaussianity may dominate over the gaussian term in the galaxy power spectrum , @xmath13 , at very large scales ( @xmath14mpc@xmath15 ) .",
    "this new contribution , which is sometimes referred to as the `` scale - dependent bias '' of the galaxy power spectrum , may be a powerful indicator to constrain @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , it has been recently applied to the clustering statistics of sdss lrg and quasar samples , and the tight constraints on @xmath2 are comparable to those obtained from cmb measurements have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the bispectrum of biased tracers in detail .",
    "while the matter bispectrum in the presence of primordial non - gaussianity has been studied in the literature using both perturbation theory and numerical simulations , the galaxy bispectrum may significantly differ from the matter bispectrum in the presence of primordial non - gaussianity , just like the difference in the power spectra . since the local type non - gaussianity can be straightforwardly implemented within @xmath0-body simulations , numerical study on the bispectrum for the dark matter haloes",
    "is the first important step toward a practical understanding of the galaxy bispectrum .",
    "incidentally , jeong and komatsu ( 2009 ) recently proposed a new parametrized model for the halo / galaxy bispectrum ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) based on the peak bias model @xcite and the local bias model @xcite .",
    "they found that the formula for the galaxy bispectrum used in @xcite was missing important contributions from the scale dependent bias effects and they discovered new terms that are important at `` squeezed '' configurations where @xmath16 .",
    "it was argued that these new contributions enable us to put stronger constraints on @xmath17 than those obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is of great importance to confirm the scale - dependent bias effects in the bispectrum by @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : we first review the analytical models of the power spectrum and the bispectrum of biased tracers in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "we then describe the setup and initial conditions for @xmath0-body simulations in section [ sec : simulation ] . as a first check of our simulations , in section [ sec : pow_results ]",
    ", we compute the matter and halo power spectra , and the results are compared with previous works .",
    "section [ sec : bis_results ] gives the main results of this paper , in which the simulation results for the matter and halo bispectra are presented and compared with predictions from analytic models , particularly focusing on their scale dependence .",
    "the dependence of the halo bispectrum on the halo mass threshold and redshift is also investigated in detail .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] discusses the future prospects for detecting the primordial non - gaussianity using the scale - dependent properties of the halo / galaxy bispectrum .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section , we summarize the theoretical predictions of the power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "we use perturbation theory to examine the matter power spectrum and bispectrum , and then present those of biased tracers based on the local bias model . for the scales of our interest",
    "( @xmath18 mpc@xmath15 ) , the non - linearity of gravitational evolution is moderate and the perturbation theory is valid and trustful .",
    "we especially focus on the behavior of the bispectrum in the squeezed limit on large scales , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "let us first consider the matter density fluctuation .",
    "we perturbatively expand this as @xmath22 the linear - order solution is related to the bardeen s curvature perturbation in equation ( [ eq : fnllocal ] ) in fourier space by @xmath23 where the conversion factor @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 in the above , @xmath26 is the current matter density normalized by the critical density , @xmath27 is current hubble constant , @xmath28 denotes the matter transfer function normalized to unity at @xmath20 and @xmath29 is the linear growth rate normalized to the scale factor in the limit of matter dominant era .",
    "the higher - order solutions , @xmath30 , are formally written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the kernel functions ( see @xcite for a review ) . then keeping terms up to fourth order in @xmath34 , the power spectrum and bispectrum of the matter density fluctuations",
    "are given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\      & & + 2f_2({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_1,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_2)p_0(k_1;z)p_0(k_2;z)+{({\\rm cyc . } ) } , \\label{eq : bis_pt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the cyclic permutations over the indices and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the power- , bi- , and tri - spectra of @xmath34 .",
    "in equation ( [ eq : pow_pt ] ) , the second term is the first non - trivial correction in the presence of primordial non - gaussianity , and the function @xmath38 implies the primordial bispectrum , which corresponds to the leading - order contribution in equation ( [ eq : bis_pt ] ) .",
    "note that the contribution coming from the primordial trispectrum @xmath39 is small for local type non - gaussianity with reasonable values of @xmath2 , and we drop this term in computing @xmath40 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the power spectrum of biased tracers has been recently discussed in the literature @xcite , based on several different formalisms including peak bias , halo bias according to the peak - background split , and local bias .",
    "the resultant expressions of the galaxy / halo power spectrum are basically the same , and are summarized in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the bias parameters relating the galaxy overdensity to the matter overdensity . in [ app : pow_bis ] , we present a derivation of ( [ eq : pow_bias ] ) based on the local bias formalism .",
    "the explicit expressions for the bias parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be obtained both from the peak bias and halo bias formalisms , and their results are basically the same in the high - peak / threshold limit . in [ app : bias ] , we show that in the high - peak limit , there is a clear relationship between the peak bias and the local bias prescriptions , and the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 are related to each other in terms of the critical density of the spherical collapse model , @xmath44 , as @xmath45 .    in equation ( [ eq : pow_bias ] )",
    ", the factor in the braces manifestly depends on the scale , which is the main source for `` scale - dependent bias '' . on large scales ( @xmath20 ) , the function @xmath24 is roughly proportional to @xmath46 , and it strongly affects the galaxy power spectrum . in this respect ,",
    "the scale - dependent property will be a clear indicator of primordial non - gaussianity of the local type , and it has been extensively tested against @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "several recent studies have suggested that some modifications to this formula are required in order to model the scale - dependent bias more accurately @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed a slight modification to the relation of bias parameters , which reproduces results from @xmath0-body simulations very well : @xmath47 with @xmath48 , which comes from the ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "now , we turn our focus to the bispectrum of biased tracers in the presence of primordial non - gaussianity . according to the analytical study by @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the effect of local - type primordial non - gaussianity is mainly imprinted on the bispectrum of squeezed triangular configurations .",
    "the galaxy bispectrum is then expressed as @xmath49 where each term of the right - hand side of this equation has the following asymptotic form : @xmath50\\,p_{k\\to0}^2(z ) \\,{\\cal m}_{k\\to0}^{-1}(z)\\,k^{2n_s-2}\\,\\alpha^1 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : b1 } \\\\",

    "see [ app : pow_bis ] for a more rigorous expression .",
    "the function @xmath53 weakly depends on @xmath54 and the smoothing scale , @xmath55 , and it can be approximated as @xmath56 on large scales . in the above , we take the limit of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 are defined through @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "see [ app : pow_bis ] and also @xcite for more details .",
    "similar to the scale dependence of the galaxy / halo power spectrum in equation ( [ eq : pow_bias ] ) , the amplitude of bispectrum is also affected by the primordial non - gaussianity in a scale - dependent way .",
    "in particular , the term @xmath61 , which is of quadratic order in @xmath2 , becomes dominant on large scales and exhibits a behavior strongly dependent on @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , we might conclude that this is the most important indicator of @xmath2 , capable of detecting the primordial non - gaussianity with upcoming galaxy surveys of large volumes .    in what follows",
