    "a theoretical framework for the study of heavy - quark fragmentation functions ( hqff ) has been available for a long time  @xcite , and several phenomenological analysis based upon this formalism have appeared in the literature  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , next - to - leading fits to the charm - momentum spectrum at argus were performed and used to predict the bottom spectrum from @xmath5 decays . from this analysis ,",
    "the non - perturbative part of the fragmentation function predicted for the bottom quark turned out to be quite hard : in fact , much harder than predicted in monte carlo models using the standard peterson  @xcite parametrization .",
    "more precise data  @xcite have become available since then , giving an indication of a hard bottom fragmentation function . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a study of the charm fragmentation function was performed , using a parametrization of the non - perturbative effects based upon the peterson fragmentation function , instead of the form adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite . a quantitative result on the value of the @xmath6 parameter",
    "was obtained there , definitely showing that @xmath6 is much smaller in next - to - leading - log ( nll ) fits rather than in the leading - log ( ll ) ones .",
    "the interest in further refining our understanding of the fragmentation functions for heavy quark stems mainly from the possibility of using them to improve our understanding of heavy - flavour hadroproduction and photoproduction . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a formalism for the computation of heavy - flavour production , that merges the high - transverse - momentum approach ( i.e.  the fragmentation - function approach ) and the fixed - order one , was developed .",
    "it was found there that mass - suppressed effects are quite large even at moderately large transverse momenta .",
    "this work is a first step towards a sound application of the fragmentation - function formalism in the moderate - transverse - momentum range .",
    "it should , however , be complemented by similar calculations in the context of @xmath2 annihilation , since this is the place where the impact of non - perturbative effects is studied .",
    "this is in fact the purpose of the present work : to use all the available knowledge on heavy - flavour production in @xmath2 annihilation in order to reach an assessment of the size of non - perturbative effects .",
    "there are theoretical approaches to the fragmentation - function calculation that rely upon heavy - quark effective theory in order to study more systematically non - perturbative effects  @xcite . in the present work , however , we want to establish a connection with the most commonly used parametrization , and thus we will use the peterson form throughout .",
    "fixed - order ( fo ) calculations of the @xmath7 differential cross section for heavy - quark production in @xmath4 annihilation  @xcite do exist today , and some applications in the context of hqff  @xcite have already appeared . in practice , the fixed - order calculation should be more reliable than the hqff approach for small annihilation energies .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to consider an approach in which the fixed - order and the hqff calculations are merged , in the spirit of the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , without overcounting . in the following",
    ", we will thus review the hqff and the fixed - order - calculation results on fragmentation functions .",
    "we will then define a merged approach , in which the fixed - order result is supplemented with leading and next - to - leading logarithmically - enhanced contributions at all orders in @xmath8 .",
    "we will consider both charm- and bottom - production data , which we fit using a peterson parametrization of the non - perturbative contribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theoretical ] we fix our notation , and describe the aim of our improved approach . in section  [ sec : nonperturbative ] we describe the procedure we use in order to incorporate a parametrization of the non - perturbative effects in our formalism .",
    "this procedure is to some extent arbitrary .",
    "it is however important that the same procedure is used throughout our calculation . in section  [ sec : fo ]",
    "we describe the fixed - order calculation of the fragmentation function .",
    "some subtleties , related to its normalization , are discussed in detail .",
    "section  [ sec : nll ] is dedicated to the computation of the resummed cross section truncated to order @xmath9 , at the nll level ( tnll ) .",
    "this calculation is almost equivalent to neglecting all mass - suppressed terms ( i.e.  terms that vanish like powers of @xmath10 ) in the fo calculation , except that terms of order @xmath9 , without any power of @xmath11 , are not included here . in this section",
    "we spell out the definition of the improved approach , and clarify its practical implementation . in section  [ sec : comp ]",

    "we take @xmath104 , while for @xmath1 mesons we use @xmath105 .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales have been settled equal to the total energy @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , we have fixed @xmath106  mev , so that @xmath107 .    in the fixed - order calculation , we have taken three light flavours , for the energy of @xmath108  gev , and four light flavours for @xmath103  gev . according to the renormalization scheme  @xcite we used in our fo calculation  @xcite , this implies that the strong coupling constant runs with @xmath109 flavours , where @xmath84 is the total number of flavours , including the massive one .",
    "for this reason , in order to compare the fo results with the resummed and the truncated ones ( where the the heavy flavour is treated as a light one ) , we have to change the strong coupling constant , according to ^(n_f-1)(e ) = ^(n_f)(e ) - t_f ^2 + o@xmath75 , where we have used the renormalization group equation  ( [ eq : rge ] ) and the matching condition ^(n_f)(m ) = ^(n_f-1)(m ) .",
    "this implies that the fo differential cross section , computed with @xmath110 , .",
    "= a^(0 ) + a^(1 ) ^(n_f-1)(e)+ a^(2 ) ^2(e ) , acquires a contribution , proportional to the @xmath111 term , once written in terms of @xmath112 .",

    "[ fig : argus_as ] ,  [ fig : opal_as ] and  [ fig : aleph_as ] , we plot the following quantities :    * the dot - dashed line is the differential cross section at order @xmath8 .",
    "it corresponds to the sum of the terms up to the order @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig_fix_norm ] ) ; * the dotted line represents the cross section at order @xmath8 without power - suppressed mass effects .",
    "we see that such terms give a noticeable contribution only at , while they are completely negligible at  and ; * the dashed line represents the ll resummed cross section of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ll ] ) . *",
    "the solid line is the improved differential cross section , obtained by merging the ll resummed and the @xmath8-order massive one . at  and",
    "the ll and the improved ll curves are almost identical . from this",
    "we infer that @xmath93 mass terms are small at  energies , and completely negligible both for @xmath113 and for @xmath114 at lep energies .",
    "notice that for very large and very small @xmath26 , the distributions we computed may become negative .",
    "this is an indication of the failure of the perturbative expansion , due to the presence of large terms proportional to powers of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these terms have not been resummed in our approach .",
    "we will discuss in more detail this problem in the next section .",
    "figures  [ fig : argus_as2 ] ,  [ fig : opal_as2 ] and  [ fig : aleph_as2 ] are similar to figs .",
    "[ fig : argus_as ] , [ fig : opal_as ] and  [ fig : aleph_as ] , but they include next - to - leading effects .    thus :    * the dot - dashed line is the differential cross section of eq .",

    "all mass effects and the exact @xmath9 term are present ; * the dotted line represents the tnll cross section of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnll ] ) .",
    "it differs from the previous curve for the absence of mass power - suppressed effects and of nnll @xmath9 contributions ( the terms not accompanied by large logarithms ) .",
    "we can see that , for the  and  curves , where @xmath10 terms are much smaller than the  ones , the effect of the nnll @xmath9 term is quite small , except for the small-@xmath26 region in the  cross section , where the splitting mechanism of a gluon , coming from a primary light - quark pair , gives a sizable contribution ; * the dashed line is the nll resummed cross section of eq .",

    "( [ eq : sig_norm ] ) ; * the solid line is the improved cross section of eq .",
    "( [ eq : improvedh ] ) , that takes account of the nll resummed effects and of the mass and nnll @xmath9 terms .",
    "we notice that , for the next - to - leading curves , the resummed cross section tends to be softer than the fixed - order one , so that it will need a harder non - perturbative fragmentation function ( corresponding to smaller values of @xmath6 ) in order to fit the data .",
    "furthermore , this effect is much more pronounced at lep energies , as one can expect .",
    "mass effects seem to be very small in this context . in general",
    ", we see that they harden the fragmentation function .",
    "we thus expect that they will lead to larger values of @xmath6 when fitting the data .",
    "we present now some fits to the experimental data in order to extract the non - perturbative part of the fragmentation functions .",
    "we consider the following data sets    * @xmath117 meson at  @xcite , at @xmath102  gev , * @xmath118 meson at  @xcite , at @xmath103  gev , * @xmath1 meson at  @xcite , at @xmath103  gev .    besides the ll and nll fits ( similar to that ones made in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we present new fits with our improved cross section . furthermore , we present fits where the initial conditions  ( [ eq : ini ] ) for the fragmentation functions are taken in an exponentiated form ( called `` nll expon '' ) . in @xmath51-space , the exponentiated initial conditions read [ eq : ini_exp_n ] _",
    "q(n,_0,m ) & = & ( _ 0 ) d^(1)_q(n,_0,m ) + _ g(n,_0,m ) & = & ( _ 0 ) d^(1)_g(n,_0,m)-1 .",
    "these initial conditions are equivalent , from the point of view of nll resummation , to the ones in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ini ] ) .",
    "they are introduced here only to enhance higher order effects in the large-@xmath26 region .",
    "in fact , these terms partially account for sudakov behaviors in the endpoint region  @xcite .",
    "we will see that their effect is quite dramatic , and , in particular , that they remedy to the problem of negative cross sections at large @xmath26 .",
    "they are shown here just for the purpose of illustrating how higher order perturbative terms may get rid of this problem .",
    "the negative values in the small-@xmath26 region are related to the multiplicity problem  @xcite .",
    "we will not try to remedy to them in this context , since they are not very important in the experimental configurations we consider .",
    "we have fitted the data by @xmath119 minimization . with this procedure",
    "we have fitted both the value of @xmath6 and the normalization , which was allowed to float .",
    "we have kept @xmath120 fixed to @xmath121  mev .",

    "the range of the fit is indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig : argus_nllimprov][fig : opal_nllexp ] with small crosses .",
    "@xmath122 we have excluded the first three experimental points for the @xmath8 fixed - order fit to the  data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the corresponding curves , together with the data , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : argus_nllimprov][fig : aleph_nllimprov ] .    the full improved resummed result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : improvedh ] ) has been used here . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the nll curves computed at the same value of @xmath6 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : argus_nllexp ] and  [ fig : opal_nllexp ] , we illustrate the nll differential cross section , obtained with the exponentiated condition  ( [ eq : ini_exp_n ] ) .",
    "we see a better behavior at @xmath123 , while the values of the @xmath6 parameter for the best fit are quite small . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the nll curves at the same @xmath6 value and the nll best fit with the value of @xmath6 taken from tab .",
    "[ tab : ep_valuesii ] .",
    "the small differences we find in the ll and nll sectors , with respect to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , are due to different range , normalization and adjustment of physical parameters .    from the value of the @xmath6 parameter for ,  and",
    ", we can easily see that it scales nearly quadratically in the heavy - quark mass , as expected .",
    "in this work we have considered the heavy - flavour fragmentation functions in @xmath2 annihilation .",
    "we have devised and implemented a method by which all perturbative effects that have been calculated so far can be included in the computation of the fragmentation function .",
    "these include leading and next - to - leading logarithmic resummation , fixed - order effects up to @xmath7 , and mass effects to the same order .",
    "our finding can be easily summarized as follows .",
    "we generally find little difference between our results and the nll resummed calculation .",
    "this indicates that mass effects are of limited importance in fragmentation - function physics in @xmath2 annihilation . on the other hand ,",
    "our calculation confirms the fact that , when nll effects are included , the importance of a non - perturbative initial condition is reduced .",
    "for example , at  energies , we see a strong reduction of the @xmath6 parameter , from @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "this reduction is also observed in the fixed - order calculation , where @xmath6 goes from @xmath126 to @xmath127 when the @xmath3 effects are included .",
