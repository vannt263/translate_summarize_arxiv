    "one of the mysteries of elementary particle physics is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in the standard model ( sm )",

    "the cern lep2 collider is expected to ultimately reach a center - of - mass energy @xmath8 gev and integrated luminosity of @xmath9 per experiment , allowing an exploration of @xmath10 up to approximately @xmath11 gev .",
    "experiments at the cern lhc ought to be able to observe @xmath4 for @xmath12  gev , although if @xmath10 is in the intermediate mass regime ( @xmath13 gev ) , several years of running may be required to extract the @xmath14 signal from qcd two photon backgrounds .",
    "it has been pointed out that a high luminosity fermilab tevatron @xmath0 collider has significant reach for a higgs boson@xcite .",
    "the most promising channel at the tevatron is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the lightest higgs scalar @xmath26 has a mass that is typically @xmath27 gev@xcite .",
    "furthermore , frequently the lightest susy higgs boson @xmath26 behaves much like the sm higgs boson .",
    "thus , the higgs boson mass reach of the tevatron collider is particularly fascinating in that it may nearly saturate the parameter space of many interesting supersymmetric models .",
    "the implication is that , if susy exists , then high luminosity upgrades of the fermilab tevatron @xmath28 collider will either discover the lightest susy higgs boson @xmath26 , or will exclude much of the parameter space of many susy models !",
    "our goal in this paper is to translate the already calculated tevatron sm higgs boson mass reach into a reach in parameter space of three specific models involving weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "these models are used for most phenomenological analyses of supersymmetry .",
    "the first model assumes the generic structure of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite with no assumptions about physics at scales beyond @xmath29 tev . in this case , we set all dimensional susy parameters ( such as soft susy breaking sfermion and gaugino masses , and @xmath30 ) to @xmath31  tev , except @xmath32-parameters which are set to zero , so that the relevant parameter space consists of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson and @xmath35 is the ratio of higgs field vacuum expectation values .",
    "several papers have presented susy higgs search projections for lep2 and lhc in this parameter space@xcite .",

    ", it is assumed that susy breaking takes place in a hidden sector , and susy breaking effects are communicated to the observable sector via gravitational interactions . in the minimal rendition of this model ,",
    "all scalars have a common mass @xmath36 at the gut scale , while all gauginos have a common gut scale mass @xmath37 , and all trilinear scalar couplings unify to @xmath38 , where the universality of the various parameters occurs at some ultra - high scale @xmath39 . weak scale sparticle and higgs masses are obtained via renormalization group running of soft susy breaking masses and couplings from @xmath40 down to @xmath41 , where radiative electroweak symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "ultimately , all sparticle masses and mixings are calculated in terms of the parameter set @xmath42 where @xmath30 is the superpotential higgs mass parameter , whose magnitude is fixed by the condition of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the last model we consider is the simplest gauge mediated susy breaking model  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "susy breaking again takes place in a hidden sector , but susy breaking is communicated to the visible sector via messenger fields which also interact via usual gauge interactions .",
    "sparticle masses are proportional to their gauge couplings , and their overall scale is set by the parameter @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the susy breaking scale and @xmath45 the mass scale for the messenger particles .",
    "the model is parameterized in terms of  @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of complete @xmath48 messenger multiplets ( @xmath49 if @xmath50 is @xmath51  tev ) , and @xmath52 is the ratio of hidden sector to messenger sector vacuum expectation values of auxiliary fields .",
    "these susy models are incorporated in the event generator isajet 7.37@xcite .",
    "therein the susy higgs boson masses are calculated by minimizing the renormalization - group - improved one - loop effective potential . the minimization is performed at an optimized scale choice @xmath53 , which effectively includes the dominant two - loop contributions@xcite to @xmath54 .",

    "this window is similar to but smaller than the one noted in refs . @xcite",
    "that also occurs at the cern lhc .",
    "most or all of the window may be filled in at the cern lhc by high luminosity running , and by searches for @xmath126 , @xmath132 or @xmath133 modes from higgs production . if the tevatron integrated luminosity is increased to 30 fb@xmath3 , the @xmath107 region increases towards lower @xmath35 , but most of the unobservable domain persists even at this higher integrated luminosity , and is not filled in even by our projection of the ultimate reach of lep2 .",

    "the d0 and cdf experiments at the tevatron  @xcite , from a non - observation of di - photon events with large @xmath160 have inferred a lower bound of about 150  gev on the chargino mass : this excludes essentially the same region as the aleph neutralino bound .",
    "the current bound from lep2 due to higgs boson searches is shown as the region below the contour labelled `` lep2 current '' in the very low @xmath35 region of each plot .",
    "the lep2 ultimate reach is for the area below the contour labelled `` @xmath119 ultimate '' , and can only probe parameter space with @xmath161 .",
    "experiments at the fermilab tevatron will explore the region below the `` @xmath106 at 10 fb@xmath3 '' contour with @xmath162 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity . by increasing the integrated luminosity to @xmath163 fb@xmath3 ,",

    "we have also again examined the effect of setting @xmath142 gev for the gmsb model .",

    "finally , we have also explored the higgs boson reach for the case @xmath171 , the largest value of @xmath47 for which couplings remain perturbative up to a large scale when @xmath50 is 1000  tev .",
    "the ex region may be somewhat underestimated  @xcite since we obtain it using the same bound @xmath172  gev used in the @xmath152 case , in conjunction with the bound on @xmath173 . in this case",
    ", @xmath54 is typically larger for a given @xmath174 and @xmath35 value than for the @xmath175 case .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "the overall structure of the plot is similar to the results from fig.[fig5 ] , except that the @xmath106 reach for 25 fb@xmath3 is considerably smaller .",
    "however , the whole parameter plane shown can once again be covered by 30 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the lightest neutral scalar higgs boson is lighter than @xmath176  gev in a wide variety of interesting models commonly used for phenomenological studies of weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "this observation , together with the fact that the most careful study to date yields a sm higgs boson reach of about 120  gev at proposed luminosity upgrades of the tevatron , motivated us to translate this reach to the corresponding reach in three classes of susy models : the mssm with @xmath31  tev , the msugra model , and finally , the gmsb model . while there are viable models where the @xmath177  gev limit on the lightest of the neutral higgs scalars can be significantly surpassed , these models generally contain additional fields ( most commonly higgs singlets ) which serve no specific purpose , and hence are less attractive theoretically .",
    "assuming that the conclusion about the reach for the sm higgs boson holds up to closer scrutiny  @xcite , we find that it should be possible to discover at least one of the higgs bosons over the entire parameter space of the msugra and gmsb models , and over most of the parameter space of the mssm , provided tevatron experiments can accumulate an integrated luminosity of 25 - 30  fb@xmath3 . the large integrated luminosity is crucial for an exploration of the parameter space : if the integrated luminosity is `` just '' 10  fb@xmath3 the signal is detectable over a much smaller range of parameters .",
    "specifically , for the case of the mssm , experiments at tev33 should be able to probe the entire model parameter space given 25 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity , except for a window of unobservability around @xmath178 gev .",
    "for the case of the msugra model , both lep2 and tev33 should be able to probe the entire parameter space for low @xmath35 ; for higher @xmath35 , the reach of lep2 will be limited , and tevatron experiments will need 30 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity to probe the entire model parameter space . for gmsb models , the ultimate reach of lep2 is limited to low values of @xmath35 , while the fermilab tevatron will need @xmath179 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity to probe the entire parameter space .",
    "this conclusion is insensitive to the specific value of @xmath47 as long as the messenger scale @xmath50 is not too large .",
    "in summary , if future luminosity upgrades of the tevatron are able to accumulate an integrated luminosity of 25 - 30  fb@xmath3 , experiments at these facilities should be able to probe most of the parameter space of these models via a search for @xmath180 events . while a discovery of a signal would be very exciting ,",
    "it would not , by itself , allow us to conclude that we had discovered susy .",
    "if instead tevatron experiments do accumulate the required data sample and conclusively find no signal for the higgs boson , it would exclude most of the parameter space of currently popular susy models , and cause us to rethink our ideas of how weak scale supersymmetry might be realized in nature .",

    "<S> this limit nearly saturates the parameter space for many models of weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) with a minimal particle content . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore interesting to examine the susy higgs reach of future tevatron experiments . </S>",
    "<S> contours are presented of higgs boson reach for cern lep2 and tevatron luminosity upgrades for three models of weak scale susy : the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) and a simple gauge mediated susy breaking model ( gmsb ) . in each case </S>",
    "<S> we find a substantial gain in reach at the tevatron with integrated luminosity increasing from 10  fb@xmath3 to 25 - 30  fb@xmath3 . with the larger integrated luminosity , a higgs search at the tevatron should be able to probe essentially the entire parameter space of these models . </S>",
