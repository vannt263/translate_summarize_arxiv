    "this paper aims to generalize and extend some results in [ kw ] and [ w ] about deconstruction of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) into multipole vectors and explain these results to a mathematically inclined audience .",
    "our exposition , to a degree , is self - sufficient .",
    "cosmologists who study the cmbr routinely decompose it into a sum of spherical harmonics ",
    "the eigenfunctions of the laplace operator on the @xmath15-sphere .",
    "the summand that corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath16 of the laplace operator is called a @xmath1-th _ spherical harmonic_. this decomposition helps to analyze the correlations between the magnitude and geometry of various harmonics .",
    "the ultimate goal of these investigations is to understand the geometry of the visible universe and the physics of the big bang .",
    "the data obtained by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) reveal puzzling correlations between the low-@xmath1 portion of the harmonic decomposition of the cosmic microwave background radiation [ b ] , [ chs ] , [ toh ] , [ ehgl ] . in the case of quadrupole - octopole ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) alignment , simulations based on our fast algorithm [ kw ] , [ w ]",
    "show the alignment to be unusual at the 98.7 percent level .",
    "no explanation is yet known for these strange results .",
    "_ multipole vectors _ provide a convenient means to study the isotropic properties of cmbr .",
    "in particular , they help to quantify the planarity of a given multipole , as well as to compare the alignment of two different multipoles [ chs ] .",
    "jeff weeks and i , coming from a background in pure mathematics , were unable to decipher the formalism and terminology of [ chs ] and chose instead to re - create the multipole vector concept from scratch ( see [ kw ] ) .",
    "later on , as we read the papers [ l ] and [ d ] , we realized that we managed to reinvent the wheel twice : our key algebraic lemma turns out to be a classical theorem of sylvester [ s ] , [ s1 ] , while the application of that lemma to harmonic polynomials on sphere implicitly was known to maxwell [ m ] .",
    "the real - valued spherical harmonics of order @xmath1 are precisely the homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree @xmath1 in the variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath6 is the polynomial @xmath21 , up to normalization . ] .",
    "thus , we sought to understand the multipole vectors of copi , huterer and starkman [ chs ] from a polynomial point of view .",
    "as in [ ch ] , this calls for using some elementary tools from the field of algebraic geometry .",
    "translated to the language of polynomials , [ chs ] s motivating goal was to factor every homogeneous harmonic polynomial @xmath8 of degree @xmath1 on the sphere into a product of linear factors @xmath22 such a factorization is impossible in general , as [ chs ] implicitly acknowledge by their introduction of suitable error terms .",
    "the correct statement is given by the sylvester theorem [ s ] , [ s1 ] : by the authors . ]",
    "every real homogeneous polynomial @xmath8 of degree @xmath1 in @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath6 may be written as @xmath23 where the remainder term @xmath24 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath25 .",
    "the decomposition is unique up to reordering and rescaling of the linear factors in the product .    for a _ harmonic _ homogeneous @xmath8",
    ", a somewhat similar representation was discovered by james clerk maxwell in his 1873 _ treatise on electricity and magnetism _ [ m ] .",
    "its relation to algebraic geometry in general , and to the sylvester theorem , in particular , is well - explained by courant and hilbert in [ ch ] vii , sec .",
    "we will describe the maxwell representation later in the paper .",
    "sylvester s theorem 1 ( which is just an application of bzout s theorem ) has a pleasing corollary :     @xmath26 $ ] when restricted to a unit sphere @xmath2 , every real polynomial @xmath8 in @xmath5 , and @xmath6 of degree @xmath1 can be written in the form @xmath27 the decomposition is unique up to reordering and rescaling of the linear factors in each of the products .",
    "in particular , one can pick each @xmath28 to be a unit vector and , for @xmath29 , each @xmath30 .",
    "it is well - known that spherical harmonics form a basis in the space @xmath31 of @xmath32-integrable functions on a unit sphere ( see [ ch ] ) . as a result",
    ", an infinite maxwell - type decomposition is available for any function @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "[ l ] , formula @xmath34 ) .",
    "any real function @xmath35 has a representation in the form @xmath36 where the series converges in the @xmath32-norm , and the mutually orthogonal polynomials in the figure brackets are among the @xmath1-th spherical harmonics .",
    "this representation is unique , up to reordering and rescaling of the linear factors in each of the products .    in the space of real continuous functions @xmath37 on @xmath2 there is a dense ( in the @xmath38-norm ) and @xmath39-invariant subset @xmath40 comprised of functions that admit a representation in the form of a series @xmath41 that uniformly converges on the sphere .",
    "each functions from @xmath40 admits a canonical extension into the interior of the unit ball @xmath42 where it produces a real analytic function .",
    "this theorem , claiming a form of stability of decomposition @xmath43 under the polynomial approximations , is a useful tool for analyzing patterns in the spherical sky [ w ] .    at the first glance",
    ", the sphere seems to occupy a special place in these results .",
    "however , what is really important , is the _",
    "quadratic nature _ of the surface .",
    "this paper is concerned with similar decompositions of functions on other quadratic algebraic skies ( real and complex ) .",
    "for instance , it is natural to wonder : can one deconstruct in a similar fashion polynomial or real analytic functions on a hyperboloid ?",
    "the short answer is  yes , one can \" , but the uniqueness of the representation is lost .",
    "the focal point of this paper is to describe rich and interesting algebro - geometrical structures and topology of modular spaces of multipoles . in the process , we bring under the same roof a variety of mathematical techniques and constructions that belong to the fields of algebraic geometry , singularity theory , algebraic topology , harmonic analysis , and the polynomial approximation theory .",
    "none of our techniques is very advanced , but their natural appearance within the context of studying quadratic surfaces is pleasing and somewhat surprising ...",
    "the reader can follow two distinct treads in the core of the paper .",
    "the first unifies results that are linear in nature and are based on the classical theory of harmonic analysis on quadratic surfaces .",
    "these results are valid for quadratic hypersurfaces _ in any dimension_. the second tread winds through the results that require methods of algebraic geometry .",
    "these results are uniquely _ three - dimensional _ , that is , applicable only to quadratic _",
    "we denote by @xmath44 $ ] the ring of complex polynomials in the variables @xmath45 and @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath12 be an irreducible quadratic form over the complex numbers @xmath46 . from a strictly algebraic perspective , one can interpret this section as describing the ways in which the quotient ring @xmath44 /   \\langle q - \\lambda \\rangle$ ] , @xmath47 , fails to be a unique factorization domain .",
    "however , the flavor of our approach to this problem is more geometrical and combinatorial",
