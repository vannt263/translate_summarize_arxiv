    "early ideas on properties of gluonic mesons or glueballs as bound states of gauge bosons within qcd remained inconclusive at first because of an apparent lack of phenomenological evidence for such resonances beyond the prominent mesons @xmath2 , baryons @xmath3 and antibaryons @xmath4 .",

    "we consider hadron hadron and nucleus nucleus collisions at energies high enough to be dominated by pomeron exchange . in this energy domain , multiplicities of produced particles , including heavy flavors such as strangeness and charm , could exhibit limiting behaviour in their ratios . in this regime",
    "we expect the glueball production to be dominant without imposing rapidity gaps .",
    "we propose to study consequences of the hypothesis that correspondingly dominant particle production proceeds from a gluon rich environment .",
    "this then translates into a major component of @xmath10 production . in this process the lower mass region @xmath30",
    "is assumed to be dominant , similar to the shape of the red dragon observed in central production in the reaction @xmath14 shown in figure [ figcent ] .",
    "it is a general property of a wide resonance that its line shape is not universal but rather chameleon like .",
    "this is supported by the contrast between the line shapes in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the line shape in figure 2 shows an exponential dependence on the invariant mass , suggestive of a thermal distribution .",
    "we therefore deduce that the production of low masses of the @xmath20 glueball state is preferred in a high energy and high density hadronic environment .",
    "thus the two pion decay mode of @xmath31 becomes dominant , giving rise to characteristic two pion s - wave correlations relative to directly produced pions , which in an approximately thermal and noninteracting model remain uncorrelated .",

    "proceeds as follows    @xmath37    the decay channel in equation ( [ eq:3a ] ) is not characteristic for a glueball .",
    "the gluonic zweig rule suppresses the mixing of glueball and @xmath2 states , but it does not apply to a low mass @xmath20 state because of the strong effective coupling .",
    "this is reflected by the large width ( @xmath38 1 gev ) of the @xmath20 glueball @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the branching fraction for the decay in eq .",

    "the latter is extracted from central @xmath41 production of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath20 glueball state in the high track density environment in the final state of heavy ion collisions could be pursued by searching for the typical inteference pattern displayed in figures ( [ gbfig3 ] ) and ( [ figcent ] ) in the invariant mass distributions of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the decay channel to kaons is less affected by background , however it can reconstruct only the tail of the @xmath20 invariant mass distribution .",
    "especially the @xmath42 mode singles out natural spin parity ( e.g. @xmath20 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , ... ) .",
    "this fact compensates for the loss of statistics as compared to the @xmath43 channel .",
    "in particular the @xmath48 channel is absent .",
    "+ the characteristic interference pattern could be enhanced applying cuts on kinematic variables like the transverse momentum ( @xmath49 ) and the opening angle of the decay products .",
    "further we put forward the question , whether background subtraction differential in relative momentum of the decay products ( e.g. @xmath42 ) , renders possible an angular momentum analysis overcoming the serious combinatorial background .",
    "this analysis has been succesfully performed in pp collisions @xcite albeit imposing severe rapidity gaps .",
    "+ the measurement of the @xmath46 glueball state through e.g. the decay channel @xmath50 may be possible .",
    "the associated production of the gb @xmath46 is suppressed compared to the @xmath20 state due to its mass .",
    "nevertheless it could be identified especially in the @xmath51 channels because of two things : first it would dominate the production of @xmath46 @xmath2 states of comparable mass and second it would decay through a normal decay width given in table 1 into @xmath26 and @xmath51 . due to the well defined shape of the @xmath52 glueball and its small width it is possible to suppress the background in a more efficient way than for the @xmath20 glueball .",
    "this is achieved through cuts applied to the decay kinematics of the meson pairs ( e.g. @xmath53 ) .",
    "+ the production of the @xmath20 state could have important consequences for the invariant mass distribution of @xmath54 pairs , through the decay channel @xmath55 .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of @xmath41 pairs produced in s+au and pb+au reactions at 200 and 158 gev per nucleon respectively shows a significant excess over expectations based on known sources of @xmath41 pair production @xcite as shown in figure [ na45 ] .",
    "+ we emphasize that the contribution denoted known sources in figure [ na45 ] represents the best knowledge as processed in monte carlo studies of @xmath56 and @xmath57 collisions at comparatively lower energy density than in central pb pb collisions at 158 gev / c per nucleon .",
    "figure [ gb_rho_nocuts ] shows the invariant mass distribution of @xmath41 pairs resulting from the decay @xmath58 and from the assumed copious production and decay of the @xmath20 glueball state : @xmath59 .",
    "+ in this calculation it was assumed that the product of production cross section times branching fraction into @xmath60 of the @xmath61 meson and the @xmath20 glueball state are in the ratio of 1 : 20 .    the branching ratio of the @xmath62 is @xmath63 and comparable with the one of @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore it was assumed that the @xmath20 glueball state is distributed in mass as shown in figure [ figcent ] .",
    "the rapidity distribution is taken as gaussian with a width of 0.6 units .",
    "for the transverse mass distribution we choose an exponential shape with inverse slope of 150 mev .",
    "the @xmath65 meson was assumed to have the same rapidity distribution as the @xmath20 and its inverse slope in @xmath66 is taken as 200 mev .",
    "additionally in order to simulate the experimental response we introduced an error of @xmath67 = 5@xmath68 for the momenta of the decay products @xmath41 .    in figure [ gb_rho_ptcut ] the influence of the rejection of all dilepton transverse momenta below 0.2 gev is shown .",
    "this cut follows the actual procedure applied to the experimental data of figure [ na45 ] .",
    "the @xmath41 pairs from the decay of the @xmath20 glueball state significantly populate the region of invariant mass where the excess is seen by the na45 experiment .",
    "the decay channel @xmath69 occurs with a branching ratio typically 100 times larger than for the decay in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3a ] ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath70 s would have predominantly very low transverse momenta displayed in figure [ gb_to_gamma ] .",
    "an abnormal production of @xmath70 s from the above decay is negligible compared to bremsstrahlung and @xmath71 decay .",
    "we discussed consequences of dominant @xmath72 glueball production in high energy collisions of hadrons and nuclei .",
    "it is conceivable that the glueball production becomes a dominant part in central nuclear collisions .",
    "the existence of the qgp phase under thermodynamic conditions above a transition temperature of 150 - 200 mev associates directly a gluon rich environment favoring the glueball production mechanism in the nuclear reaction case over hadronic collisions at the same energy .    the characteristic interference pattern of the @xmath20 glueball with the @xmath22 and @xmath13 could serve as the signature of this state decaying into a pair of mesons @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 without imposing large rapidity gaps .",
    "however the two meson channels suffer from combinatorial problems , which may be reduced for the @xmath51 channels .",
    "a promising decay channel appears : @xmath73 .",
    "this is not a characteristic glueball decay channel but enhanced through @xmath2 mixing by the large width of glueball @xmath20 .",
    "because the branching fraction of this channel is of the order @xmath39 the opposite sign dilepton signal becomes significant compared to the @xmath74 contribution .",
    "the expected signal is dominant in the dilepton mass region between 200 and 800 mev .",
    "we conjecture that this enhancement is observed in s+au and pb+au collisions at 200 and 158 gev per nucleon respectively at low impact parameter and high energy density .",
    "a dominant @xmath20 glueball component brings into focus an enhanced production of glueball @xmath46(1700 ) . due to the well defined shape of the @xmath46(1700 ) glueball and its small width it appears possible to suppress the background in a more efficient way than for the @xmath20 glueball .",
