    "the g - ratio is an explicit quantitative measure of the relative myelin thickness of a myelinated axon , given by the ratio of the inner to the outer diameter of the myelin sheath .",
    "both axon diameter and myelin thickness contribute to neuronal conduction velocity , and given the spatial constraints of the nervous system and cellular energetics , an optimal g - ratio of roughly 0.6 - 0.8 arises @xcite .",
    "spatial constraints are more stringent in the central nervous system ( cns ) , leading to higher g - ratios than in peripheral nerve @xcite .",
    "study of the g - ratio _ in vivo _ is interesting in the context of healthy development , aging , and disease progression and treatment . in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis ( ms ) ,",
    "g - ratio changes and axon loss occur , and the g - ratio changes can then partially recover during the remyelination phase @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the g - ratio is dependent on gender during development , driven by testosterone differences , has recently been proposed @xcite and investigated @xcite .",
    "possible clinical ramifications of a non - optimal g - ratio include `` disconnection '' syndromes such as schizophrenia @xcite , in which g - ratio differences have been reported @xcite .",
    "the g - ratio is expected to vary slightly in healthy neuronal tissue .",
    "the relationship between axon size and myelin sheath thickness is close to , but not exactly , linear @xcite , with the nonlinearity more pronounced for larger axon size @xcite , where the g - ratio is higher . during development ,",
    "axon growth outpaces myelination , resulting in a decreasing g - ratio as myelination catches up @xcite .",
    "there is relatively little literature on the spatial variation of the g - ratio in healthy tissue .",
    "values in the range 0.72 - 0.81 have been reported in the cns of small animals ( mouse , rat , guinea pig , rabbit ) @xcite .",
    "other primary pathology and disorders may lead to an abnormal g - ratio .",
    "these include leukodystropies and axonal changes , such as axonal swelling in ischemia .",
    "there are many outstanding questions in demyelinating disease that could be best answered by imaging the g - ratio _ in vivo_. for example , in ms , disease progression is still the topic of active research .",
    "most histopathological data are from patients at the latest stages of the disease .",
    "potential treatment includes agents for both immunosuppression and remyelination .",
    "however , if most demyelinated axons die quickly , and the rest remyelinate effectively on their own early in the disease , remyelination agents will be of little clinical value .",
    "detailed longitudinal study of the extent of remyelination can therefore aid in choosing avenues for therapy . while techniques exist for measurement of the g - ratio _ ex - vivo _ , measurement of the g - ratio _ in vivo _",
    "is an area of active research .    currently , there are quantitative mri markers that are sensitive to the myelin volume fraction ( mvf ) and the intra - axonal volume fraction or axon volume fraction ( avf ) . in recent",
    "work @xcite , it has been shown that measuring these two quantities is sufficient to compute one g - ratio for a voxel , or an _ aggregate _ g - ratio .",
    "the g - ratio is a function of the ratio of the mvf to the avf .",
    "the challenge then becomes how to estimate the mvf and the avf precisely and accurately with mri .",
    "the fiber density or fiber volume fraction ( fvf ) is the sum of the mvf and the avf , and the g - ratio imaging framework @xcite aims to decouple the fiber density from the g - ratio , such that a more complete picture of the microstructural detail can be achieved .",
    "this , coupled with other microstructural measures such as axon diameter @xcite , comprises the field of _ in vivo histology _ of white matter .",
    "we wish to describe microstructure in detail on a scale much finer than an imaging voxel , aggregated over the voxel .",
    "as previously defined , the g - ratio is the ratio of the inner to the outer diameter of the myelin sheath of a myelinated axon ( see fig . [ gcartoon ] ) .",
    "it has been shown in recent work @xcite that the g - ratio can be expressed as a function of the myelin volume fraction and the axon volume fraction , and hence can be estimated without explicit measurement of these diameters :    @xmath0    this formulation applies to any imaging modality ( e.g. , electron microscopy ( em ) , where the mvf and avf can be measured after segmentation of the image - see fig.[gcartoon ] ) , but it is of particular interest to be able to estimate the g - ratio _ in vivo_. mri provides us with several different contrast mechanisms for estimation of these volume fractions , and given mvf@xmath1 and avf@xmath1 , we can estimate @xmath2 .",
    "we will hereafter refer to this mri - based g - ratio metric as @xmath3 for simplicity , but note that it is derived from mri images with certain contrasts sensitive but not equal to the mvf and avf .",
    "estimation of these quantities is discussed in the next sections .",
    "original ( top left ) and segmented ( top right ) electron micrograph showing axons of white matter , the intra - axonal space ( blue ) , and the myelin ( red ) the myelin appears black because of osmium preparation .",
    "the fiber g - ratio is the ratio of the inner to the outer radius of the myelin sheath surrounding an axon .",
    "the aggregate g - ratio can be expressed as a function of the myelin volume fraction ( mvf ) and the axon volume fraction ( avf ) .",
    "the myelin macromolecules , myelin water , and intra- and extra - axonal water compartments all have distinct properties , which can be exploited to generate mri images from which the respective compartment volume fractions can be estimated.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      diffusion mri is particularly well suited to aid in the estimation of the axon volume fraction .",
    "it is sensitive to the displacement distribution of water molecules moving randomly with thermal energy , and this displacement distribution is affected by the cellular structure present in the tissue . as the molecules impinge on the cellular membranes , organelles , and cytoskeleton , the displacement distribution takes on a unique shape depending on the environment .",
    "intra - axonal diffusion is said to be _ restricted _ , resembling free gaussian diffusion at short diffusion times , but departing markedly from gaussianity at longer times , where the displacement distribution is limited by the pore shape .",
    "there will be a sharp drop in the probability of displacement beyond the cell radius .",
    "extra - axonal diffusion is said to be _ hindered _ , resembling free gaussian diffusion , but with a smaller variance due to impingement of motion .",
    "many diffusion models exist for explicit estimation of the relative cellular compartment sizes .",
    "these include neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging ( noddi ) @xcite , the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion ( charmed ) @xcite , diffusion basis spectrum imaging ( dbsi ) @xcite , restriction spectrum imaging ( rsi ) @xcite , white matter tract integrity ( wmti ) from diffusion kurtosis imaging ( dki ) @xcite , temporal diffusion spectroscopy @xcite , double pulsed field gradient ( dpfg ) mri @xcite , the spherical mean technique @xcite , the distribution of anisotropic microstructural environments in diffusion - compartment imaging ( diamond ) + @xcite , and many others @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to perform noddi with relaxed constraints ( noddida ) @xcite , and to do this calculation analytically ( lemonade ) @xcite .",
    "another approach , termed the apparent fiber density ( afd ) , uses high diffusion weighting to virtually eliminate the hindered diffusion signal , leaving only intra - axonal water @xcite .",
    "it has been used to estimate the the relative axon volume fraction of different fiber populations in a voxel .",
    "a modification , termed the tensor fiber density ( tfd ) , can be performed with lower diffusion weighting @xcite .",
    "the simplest diffusion mri models do not differentiate between the tissue compartments .",
    "for instance , the diffusion tensor @xcite models the entire displacement distribution as an anisotropic gaussian function . the parameters defining this function will change if the intra - axonal volume fraction changes , but to what extent is it practical to extract meaningful quantitative compartment volume fractions from the tensor ?",
    "recently , a framework called noddi - dti has been developed , in which the proximity of dti - based parameters to the computed noddi parameters is assessed @xcite , given certain assumptions .",
    "the fa and the mean diffusivity ( md ) are highly correlated in straight , parallel fiber bundles , and will change with changing avf , leading to estimates of the relative intra - axonal volume . however , this formulation is probably an oversimplification of the microstructural situation , and more detailed modeling is a better choice to ensure specificity to white matter fibers .",
    "the original full - brain g - ratio demonstration @xcite employed the noddi model of diffusion .",
    "it was chosen because of its suitability in the presence of complex subvoxel fiber geometry , including fiber divergence , which may occur to a significant scale in almost all imaging voxels @xcite , and its suitability on clinical scanners with relatively low gradient strength . having a fast implementation of the model fitting with numerical stability is important for large studies , hence",
    ", the convex - optimized amico implementation is beneficial @xcite .",
    "while diffusion mri is a modality of choice for imaging microstructure , it can only measure the displacement distribution of water molecules that are visible in a diffusion mri experiment .",
    "this limits us to water that is visible at an echo time ( te ) on the order of 50 - 100 ms , and therefore excludes water that is trapped between the myelin bilayers , which has a t@xmath4 on the order of 10 ms .",
    "hence , the estimates provided by these models are of the intra - axonal volume fraction _ of the diffusion visible volume_. myelin does not figure in the models",
    ". given , e.g. , the noddi model outputs , a complementary myelin imaging technique must be used to estimate the absolute axon volume fraction . the avf is given by    @xmath5    with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the isotropic and restricted volume fractions from the noddi model , and the mvf obtained from a myelin mapping technique , examples of which are discussed below .",
    "diffusion contrast may not be our only window onto the axon volume fraction .",
    "recent work has shown that it is possible to disambiguate the myelin , intra - axonal , and extra - axonal water compartments using complex gradient echo ( gre ) images @xcite .",
    "the myelin water is separable from the combined intra- and extra - axonal water using multicomponent t@xmath8 reconstruction , providing a myelin marker ( see below ) .",
    "however , incorporation of the phase of the gre images potentially allows us to separate all three compartments based on frequency shifts .",
    "challenges include the fact that the frequency shift is dependent on the orientation of the axon to the main magnetic field b@xmath9 .",
    "when the axon is oriented perpendicular to b@xmath9 , the myelin water will experience a positive frequency shift , the intra - axonal water a negative frequency shift , and the extra - axonal water will not experience a frequency shift .",
    "note that the avf as defined by these diffusion mri models is specific to white matter .",
    "while it makes sense to define an axon volume fraction in grey matter , the models in general can not distinguish between axons and dendrites .",
    "the noddi model s @xmath7 parameter , for example , is `` neurite density '' , i.e. , all cellular processes that can be assumed to have infinitely restricted diffusion in their transverse plane .",
    "hence , the g - ratio from mri data is undefined in grey matter .",
    "the fiber volume fraction is the sum of the avf and the mvf .",
    "can diffusion mri , or any other mri contrast mechanism , measure the total fiber volume fraction itself ? clearly , gre images have potential , as discussed above .",
    "is diffusion imaging sensitive to the fvf , as opposed to the avf ?",
    "while myelin water is virtually invisible in diffusion mri , diffusion mri is not insensitive to myelin .",
    "first , the ratio of the intra- to extra - axonal diffusion mri visible water in a voxel will change as the myelin volume fraction in that voxel changes .",
    "hence , for example , the noddi parameter @xmath7 changes with demyelination , even if all axons remain intact .",
    "second , diffusion acquisitions are heavily t@xmath4 weighted , and t@xmath4 is myelin - sensitive .",
    "the total diffusion weighted signal thus decreases as myelin content increases .",
    "however , to robustly quantify myelin volume fraction , it is necessary to add a second contrast mechanism , even if it is additional t@xmath4 weighted images , to the scanning protocol .",
    "this is discussed below .    despite the nomenclature ,",
    "as noted above , even the apparent fiber density and tensor fiber density are in fact relative axon densities .",
    "they would provide a relative fvf only if the g - ratio is constant . in a recent study of the g - ratio @xcite",
    ", the tfd was equated with the fvf , not the avf , for input to the g - ratio formula .",
    "the g - ratio is a function of the ratio of the mvf to the avf ( eq . [ geq ] ) , or alternately , the ratio of the mvf to the fvf :    @xmath10    this means that conclusions reached about the variation of the g - ratio found by equating the tfd with the fvf will be robust in this case .",
    "absolute g - ratios in this case were calibrated to have a mean of 0.7 in healthy white matter .    in early work on the fiber g - ratio , it was shown that assuming a simple white matter model of straight , parallel cylinders , the fraction anisotropy ( fa ) of the diffusion tensor is proportional to the total fiber volume fraction , with a quadratic relationship @xcite .",
    "the model has been shown to give reasonable values in human corpus callosum @xcite , however , it suffers from several problems .",
    "first , it applies only to straight , parallel fiber bundles , such as the corpus callosum and parts of the spinal tracts .",
    "however , the regions of the brain where this model can be expected to hold at all are very limited , as there are crossing or splaying fibers in up to 95% of diffusion mri voxels in parenchyma @xcite , and curvature is almost ubiquitous at standard imaging resolution .",
    "even the axons of callosal fibers are not straight and parallel , with splay up to 18@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "second , the model assumes a relatively uniform , if random , packing of axons on the scale of the mri voxel . due to the nonlinear nature of the fa",
    ", it will depend strongly on the packing geometry .",
    "if two voxels , one with densely packed axons and one with sparsely packed axons , are combined into one , the fa for that voxel will not be the average of the two original voxels , whereas the fiber density will be .",
    "third , fa is in practice acquisition and b - value dependent .",
    "we note that if diffusion mri were capable of estimating the absolute avf or fvf as well as the ratio of the intra - axonal to extra - fiber water , the g - ratio could immediately be estimated from these two quantities , without further myelin imaging .",
    "this has yet to be done robustly , and it is therefore preferable to use a more robust independent myelin marker .",
    "there are many different contrasts and computed parameters that are sensitive to myelin @xcite .",
    "the possible sources of signal from the myelin compartment are the ultra - short t@xmath4 protons in the macromolecules of the myelin sheath itself ( t@xmath12 ) and the short t@xmath4 water protons present between the phospholipid bilayers ( t@xmath13 , see fig .",
    "[ gcartoon ] ) .",
    "most mri contrast mechanisms are sensitive to myelin content , but few are specific .",
    "the myelin phospholipid bilayers create local larmor frequency variations for water protons in their vicinity due to diamagnetic susceptibility effects .",
    "this results in myelin content modulated transverse relaxation times t@xmath8 @xcite and t@xmath4 , and longitudinal relaxation time t@xmath14 . the local larmor field shift ( fl ) and the susceptibility itself ( @xmath15 ) can be computed as well @xcite .",
    "ultra - short te ( ute ) imaging can be used to image the protons tightly bound to macromolecules @xcite . an alternate approach to isolating the myelin compartment is magnetization transfer ( mt ) imaging , where the ultra - short t@xmath4 macromolecular proton pool size can be estimated by transfer of magnetization to the observable water pool .",
    "mt based parameters sensitive to macromolecular protons include the magnetization transfer ratio ( mtr ) @xcite , the mt saturation index ( mt@xmath16 ) @xcite , the macromolecular pool size ( f ) from quantitative magnetization transfer @xcite , single - point two - pool modeling @xcite , and inhomogeneous mt @xcite .",
    "alternately , the myelin water can be imaged with quantitative multicomponent t@xmath4 @xcite or t@xmath8 @xcite relaxation , which yields the myelin water fraction ( mwf ) surrogate for myelin density .",
    "variants include gradient and spin echo ( grase ) mwf imaging @xcite , linear combination myelin imaging ( e.g. , @xcite ) , t@xmath4 prepared mwf imaging @xcite , multi - component driven equilibrium single point estimation of t@xmath4 ( mcdespot ) @xcite and direct visualization of the short transverse relaxation time component via an inversion recovery preparation to reduce long t@xmath14 signal ( vista ) @xcite .",
    "other alternate approaches exploiting myelin - modulated relaxation times include combined contrast imaging ( t@xmath17/t@xmath18 ) @xcite or independent component analysis @xcite .",
    "proton density is also sensitive to macromolecular content , and the proton - density based macromolecular tissue volume ( mtv ) @xcite has been used as a quantitative myelin marker .",
    "while these mri measures have been shown to correlate highly with myelin content @xcite , they have not been incorporated in a specific tissue model in a manner similar to the diffusion signal , and hence some calibration is needed .",
    "this is still a topic of research .",
    "caveats of improper calibration of the mvf are discussed in section [ cal ] .    in this and the previous sections ,",
    "we have discussed imaging techniques for both diffusion - visible microstructure and myelin .",
    "any multi - modal modal imaging protocol with contrasts such as these , sensitive to the axon and myelin volume fractions , is sensitive to the g - ratio ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the explicit g - ratio formulation is to create a measure that is _ specific _ to the g - ratio .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether we could use a technique such as deep learning to estimate the g - ratio , skipping explicit modeling completely .      in the following sections , we illustrate several important points about g - ratio imaging using experimental data acquired at our site",
    "the following describes the acquisition protocol .",
    "we acquired data from healthy volunteers and from multiple sclerosis patients .",
    "these data were acquired on a siemens 3 t trio mri scanner with a 32 channel head coil .",
    "a t@xmath17 structural mprage volume with 1 mm isotropic voxel size was acquired for all subjects . for diffusion imaging ,",
    "the voxel size was 2 mm isotropic . for",
    "most experiments , the noddi diffusion protocol consisted of 7 b=0 s / mm@xmath19 , 30 b=700 s / mm@xmath19 , and 64 b=2000 s / mm@xmath19 images , 3x slice acceleration , 2x grappa acceleration , all acquired twice with ap - pa phase encode reversal .",
    "for the other experiments , as detailed below when they are introduced , the slice acceleration and phase encode reversal were not employed . for a dataset optimized for diffusion tensor reconstruction ,",
    "a dataset with 99 diffusion encoding directions at b=1000 s / mm@xmath19 and 9 b=0 s / mm@xmath19 images was acquired .    for magnetization transfer images",
    ", we also used 2 mm iso - tropic voxels to match the diffusion imaging voxel size . for mtr , one 3d non - selective pd - weighted rf - spoiled gradient echo ( spgr ) scan was acquired with tr=30 ms and excitation flip angle @xmath20 , and one mt - weighted scan was acquired with the same parameters and an mt pulse with 2.2 khz frequency offset and 540@xmath11 mt pulse flip angle . for mt@xmath16 computation ,",
    "these same mt - on and mt - off scans were used , with one additional t@xmath14-weighted scan with tr=11 ms and excitation flip angle @xmath21 . for qmt computation ,",
    "10-point logarithmic sampling of the z - spectrum from 0.433 - 17.235 khz frequency offset was acquired , with two mt pulse flip angles for each point , 426@xmath11 and 142@xmath11 , and excitation flip angle @xmath22 .",
    "the qmt acquisition was accelerated with 2x grappa acceleration .",
    "additional scans for correction of the maps included b@xmath14 field mapping using the double angle technique @xcite , with 60@xmath11 and 120@xmath11 flip angles , b@xmath9 field mapping using the two - point phase difference technique , with te@xmath14/te@xmath4 = 4.0/8.48 ms , and t@xmath14 mapping using the variable flip angle technique @xcite , with flip angles 3@xmath11 and 20@xmath11 .",
    "additional t@xmath4-flair and pd@xmath23 images were acquired for the ms subjects to aid in lesion segmentation .",
    "in this section , we discuss pitfalls and outstanding issues in g - ratio imaging . experimental results are included in these sections to illustrate these problems .",
    "the diffusion mri post - processing techniques described in section [ avf ] give a range of outputs .",
    "some are physical quantities ( such as the diffusion displacement distribution ; kurtosis ) , while some are parameters of detailed biological models ( such as the intra - axonal volume fraction ) .",
    "models are valuable , but the user has to be aware of the assumptions made .",
    "the parameter space in existing models ranges from three free parameters in noddi to six @xcite , twenty three @xcite , and thirty one @xcite in other models .",
    "recent analysis hypothesizes that the lower number of free parameters in , e.g. , noddi and charmed , may be matched to the level of complexity possible on current clinical systems @xcite , while high gradient strength , high b - values , and more b - shells may be necessary for more complex models @xcite , and would make them more optimal .",
    "this is a general problem with multi - exponential models when diffusion weighting is weak @xcite . on standard mr systems , relaxing the constraints on fixed parameters",
    "has been shown to lead to degeneracy of solutions @xcite .",
    "regularization approaches such as the spherical mean technique ( smt ) @xcite can make the problem less ill - posed .",
    "one of the fixed parameters in the noddi model is the parallel diffusivity in the intra- and extra - axonal space , both set to the same fixed value .",
    "other models explicitly model these as unequal ; for instance , wmti assumes that the intra - axonal diffusivity is less than or equal to the extra - axonal diffusivity .",
    "the actual values are unknown , however simulations have shown that the assumption of equal parallel diffusivities leads to a 34 - 53% overestimation of the intra - axonal compartment size if the diffusivities are in fact unequal @xcite , with the intra - axonal diffusivity either greater than or less than the extra - axonal diffusivity .",
    "independent of whether the intra- and extra - axonal parallel diffusivities are equal , another source of this bias is the tortuosity model @xcite employed by many models , including noddi , diamond , and the smt .",
    "this model computes the perpendicular extra - axonal diffusivity as a function of the diffusion - visible intra - axonal volume fraction of the non - csf tissue ( v@xmath24 in the noddi model ) .",
    "this tortuosity estimate is bound to be inaccurate because the tortuosity is expected to vary as the absolute fiber volume fraction of the non - csf tissue ( @xmath25 ) , not the diffusion - visible fiber volume fraction .",
    "these two quantities are very different , as the myelin and axon volume fractions are almost equal in healthy tissue @xcite .",
    "the mvf could be explicitly included in the equation , and would be expected to result in a myelin volume dependent reduction in @xmath7 :    @xmath26    however , in healthy tissue , where the fvf should scale roughly as the v@xmath24 parameter , this tortuosity model does not appear to hold when applied to experimental data with independent estimates of the parallel and perpendicular extra - axonal diffusivities @xcite .",
    "another fixed parameter in the noddi model is the t@xmath4 relaxation time of all tissue , assumed to be the same , even in csf .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of v@xmath27 , which can be corrected @xcite given t@xmath4 estimates from , e.g. , a t@xmath4 mapping technique such as mcdespot @xcite .",
    "diffusion mri is exquisitely sensitive to fiber geometry .",
    "the fractional anisotropy , as mentioned above , may be more sensitive to geometry than to any microstructural feature @xcite . hence , microstructural models must be careful to take geometry ( crossing , splaying , curving , microscopic packing configuration ) into account .",
    "a typical diffusion imaging voxel is roughly 8 mm@xmath28 , while the axons probed by microstructural models are on the order of one micron .",
    "the noddi model that has been used in several g - ratio imaging studies to date assumes there is a single fiber population with potential splay or curvature , but does not explicitly model crossings .",
    "furthermore , the tortuosity model employed is probably not correct for varying packing density on the sub - voxel scale @xcite ; it has been shown to depend on the packing arrangement and break down for tight axon packing @xcite .",
    "this probably explains the discrepancy between model and experiment mentioned above , because the geometry of axonal packing can vary considerably for a given average volume fraction .",
    "to what extent does the fiber dispersion model of noddi handle crossing fiber bundles ?",
    "we have employed the diffusion mri simulator dsim @xcite to investigate this question @xcite .",
    "we simulated realistic axonal packing @xcite in voxels with straight , parallel fibers and with two equal size bundles of straight fibers crossing at 90@xmath11 ( see fig.[sim ] ) .",
    "fiber volume fractions were set equal for both configurations and were varied from 0.3 to 0.7 .",
    "g - ratios were varied from 0.7 to 0.9 .",
    "the diffusion weighted signal was generated , and the noddi model parameters computed using the noddi matlab toolbox @xcite .",
    "the fvf was computed from the noddi parameters using the known mvf .",
    "the computed fvf was @xmath29 lower in the crossing fiber case for the noddi - based fvf .",
    "this demonstrates that the noddi model , while not explicitly designed for crossing fibers , gives acceptable results in this case , and can be used for full - brain g - ratio estimation at standard voxel size with significant subvoxel fiber crossing , with only a small decrease in the estimated fvf due to partial volume averaging of fiber orientations .",
    "simulated fibers in straight , parallel configuration ( left ) vs. crossing ( right ) , with equal fiber volume fraction and similar distributions of axon diameter and position .",
    "the noddi model underestimates the fvf by @xmath29 in the crossing fiber case , whereas the dti model underestimates the fvf by @xmath30.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    * _ experiments : comparison of dti and noddi for fvf estimation _ *    [ dtivsnoddi ]    noddi works optimally with diffusion mri measurements made on at least two shells in q - space , i.e. , two different nonzero b - values , although recent work has proposed solutions for single shell data , at least where certain assumptions can be made about the tissue , or where high b - values are used @xcite . in contrast , the diffusion tensor can be robustly fitted and the fiber volume fraction inferred @xcite ( see section [ fvf ] ) using a much more sparsely sampled , single shell dataset .",
    "many research programs have large databases of single - shell diffusion data , often with limited angular sampling of q - space as well .",
    "it is therefore of interest to explore to what extent such data can be used in investigation of the g - ratio .    in the simulations described above , we also computed the diffusion tensor using in - house software@xcite .",
    "the fvf was computed from the fa using the quadratic relationship determined from previous simulations @xcite . as expected ,",
    "the fa is not a predictor of fvf in the presence of crossing fibers : the computed fvf was @xmath30 lower in the crossing fiber case compared to the parallel fiber case for the dti - based fvf .",
    "to compare noddi and dti _ in vivo _ , diffusion and qmt data were acquired as described in section [ acq ] for one healthy volunteer , without slice acceleration or phase encode reversal .",
    "the qmt data were processed with in - house software and the noddi parameters as described above .",
    "the avf , mvf , and g - ratio were computed voxelwise from the diffusion and qmt data as described in section [ calculation ] . additionally , the diffusion tensor was calculated using the b=1000 s / mm@xmath19 diffusion shell .",
    "the fvf was then calculated from the fractional anisotropy of the diffusion tensor using the quadratic relationship @xcite .",
    "the corpus callosum was skeletonized on the fa image and a voxel - wise correlation between the fvf computed from dti and from noddi and qmt was performed for these voxels .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality between f and mvf was determined from previous em histological analysis @xcite .",
    "[ correlationscatter ] shows the fvf computed using both noddi and dti in the skeleton of the healthy human corpus callosum .",
    "the correlation between fvf measured using the two techniques was r=0.79 , with @xmath31 .",
    "this indicates a slight discrepancy between the fvf using noddi compared to dti , and a reasonably high correlation between techniques on the skeleton .",
    "correlation between dti- and noddi - derived fiber volume fraction on the skeleton of the corpus callosum.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    possible explanations for the higher estimates using noddi appear in section [ params ] , although without ground truth is is difficult to say which approach is more accurate .",
    "additionally , because the fa does not explicitly model compartments , it is subject to partial volume effects .",
    "while partial volume averaging with csf will decrease the fa , the fa - based quadratic fvf model appears to break down in this case .",
    "this effect could possibly be reduced by applying the free water elimination technique @xcite to obtain the correct fvf for the non - csf compartment and then scaling to reflect the partial volume averaging with csf afterward . to conclude , while the fa is generally a poor indicator of fvf , it may be a reasonable surrogate in certain special cases when data are limited .",
    "it is interesting to consider how useful imaging a cross - section of a white matter fascicle may be , regardless of the model used . if the g - ratio can be assumed to be constant along an axon , measurement of a cross - section is useful .",
    "however , in many pathological situations , such as wallerian degeneration , it is of interest to study the entire length of the axon .",

    "of interest , the g - ratio was not found to vary significantly across white matter tracts in the spinal cord , while the diffusion metrics ( restricted fraction , diffusivity of the hindered compartment , and axon diameter ) and the mtv metric did vary across tracts .",
    "this is expected , as heterogeniety in packing and axon diameter is expected to be greater than heterogeneity of the g - ratio , and the g - ratio is also robust to partial voluming effects .",
    "multiple groups have studied the g - ratio _ in vivo _ in the developing brain @xcite .",
    "axon growth outpaces myelination during development , and therefore a decreasing g - ratio is expected as myelination reaches maturity , as was seen in these studies .      imaging",
    "the g - ratio _ in vivo _ in multiple sclerosis has been explored by several groups @xcite and is of interest for several reasons .",
    "it can possibly help assess disease evolution , and can help monitor response to treatment .",
    "it has the potential to aid in the development of new therapies for remyelination .",
    "it can also help us understand which therapies might be more fruitful avenues of research . therapy for ms includes immunotherapy and remyelination therapy , however , most of our histological knowledge of ms comes from samples from older subjects at more advanced stages of the disease .",
    "if remyelination happens effectively , at least for some axons , at the earlier stages of the disease , and the myelin loss measured using myelin markers is due to fiber density loss only , then immunotherapy would be a more useful therapy , at least once most surviving axons have returned to near - normal g - ratios .    despite the promise of imaging the g - ratio _ in vivo _ with ms , it is important to remember the effect of miscalibration of the myelin metric when interpreting g - ratio estimates in ms .",
    "there is evidence that fiber density drops precipitously in some lesions @xcite .",
    "we have seen ( fig .",
    "[ gratios ] ) that in this case , mtr for example does not drop enough , making ms lesions appear to have a lowered g - ratio instead of a higher g - ratio as expected . inspecting the bottom ( red ) curve in fig .",
    "[ mvfsim ] , we see that even if there is a linear relationship between the myelin marker of choice and the mvf , miscalibration leads to an apparent g - ratio metric that is elevated in regions of lower fiber density , and significantly lower in regions of healthy fiber density . this occurs when in fact all of the fibers have the same g - ratio , and could easily be interpreted as hypomyelination in an ms subject or population .",
    "to further complicate the situation , one must consider how the myelin sensitive metrics behave in the presence of astrocyte scarring , glial cell processes , and inflammatory cell swelling .",
    "the mapping of many myelin markers to mvf may change as the ratio of myelin to other visible macromolecular structures changes .",
    "it is also not clear how well the estimates of avf and mvf behave at very low fiber density .",
    "another point of concern in ms imaging is that all myelin will affect the mr signal , even if it is not part of an intact fiber .",
    "research indicates that there is acute demyelination followed by a period of clearance of myelin debris , followed by effective remyelination . during clearance ,",
    "remyelination can occur , but this myelin is of poor quality @xcite . on the scale of an mri voxel",
    ", there can be myelin debris , poor remyelination , and higher quality remyelination .",
    "the extent to which myelin debris affects the myelin volume estimates may depend on the myelin mapping technique chosen .",
    "further studies of ms are ongoing , including pediatric populations , optic neuritis , and studies investigating whether gado - linium enhancing lesions have a distinct g - ratio .",
    "g - ratio imaging has potential to aid in the understanding and treatment of multiple other diseases .",
    "white matter abnormalities may underlie many developmental disorders .",
    "these include pelizaeus merzbacher disease and sturge - weber syndrome .",
    "the g - ratio can change due to axonal changes that occur with intact myelin ( for example , axonal swelling due to infarction ) could result in an increased apparent g - ratio .",
    "g - ratio differences have been seen in schizophrenia using electron microscopy @xcite , and researchers hope to be able to study such changes _ in vivo _ in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders .",
    "another potential application of g - ratio imaging is bridging the gap between microstructure and large - scale functional measures such as conduction delays . the theoretically optimal g - ratio for signal conduction should predict conduction delays .",
    "the true promise of g - ratio imaging will come with validation .",
    "_ ex - vivo _ validation has been performed , investigating the g - ratio explicitly @xcite and the individual metrics used to compute it , both myelin and axon volume weighted @xcite or one of these two components of the g - ratio formulation @xcite .",
    "these studies compare _ in - vivo _ or _ ex - vivo _ mri metrics to electron microscopy , optical microscopy , myelin staining , immunohistochemistry , and coherent anti - stokes raman spectroscopy ( cars ) .",
    "while no microscopy technique is perfect , microscopy provides a reasonable validation for imaging techniques , taking into account the possibility for tissue shrinkage and distortion , limitations in contrast and resolution , and segmentation techniques @xcite .",
    "interpretation of findings of demyelinating models should take into account the particularities of the demyelinating challenge .",
    "et al . _ have shown that the extra - axonal diffusivity perpendicular to axons correlates with the g - ratio in a cuprizone demyelinating model in mice @xcite .",
    "this is probably driven by a fiber volume fraction decrease , because little axon loss would be expected in this model , meaning the g - ratio and fiber volume fraction correlate highly .",
    "similarly , west _ et al . _ have shown a correlation between the discrepancy between f and mwf and the g - ratio in a knockout model in mice @xcite .",
    "this is probably a correlation with absolute myelin thickness , via exchange effects , as opposed to the g - ratio per se .",
    "we have discussed the considerable promise of g - ratio imaging with mri . computing",
    "the g - ratio metric is a useful way to interpret myelin volume - weighted and axon / fiber volume - weighted data .",
    "we have furthermore discussed the pitfalls of g - ratio imaging , including mr artefacts , lack of specificity , lack of spatial resolution , and acquisition time . with the confounds described in the text in mind , such as accuracy of myelin mapping , g - ratio imaging clearly gives us an _ aggregate _",
    "g - ratio + _ weighted _ metric .",
    "this imaging framework provides information on two quantities : the fiber density and the g - ratio , and attempts to decouple these two quantities to the best of the ability of our current imaging technology .",
    "the promise of g - ratio imaging includes the multitude of pathological conditions in which _ in vivo _ g - ratio estimates can aid in understanding disease , developing therapies , and monitoring disease progression .",
    "it also includes the study of normal variability , development , aging , and functional dynamics .",

    "<S> the fiber g - ratio is the ratio of the inner to the outer diameter of the myelin sheath of a myelinated axon . </S>",
    "<S> it has a limited dynamic range in healthy white matter , as it is optimized for speed of signal conduction , cellular energetics , and spatial constraints . _ in vivo _ imaging of the g - ratio in health and disease would greatly increase our knowledge of the nervous system and our ability to diagnose , monitor , and treat disease . </S>",
    "<S> mri based g - ratio imaging was first conceived in 2011 , and expanded to be feasible in full brain with preliminary results in 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> this manuscript reviews the growing g - ratio imaging literature and speculates on future applications . </S>",
    "<S> it details the methodology for imaging the g - ratio with mri , and describes the known pitfalls and challenges in doing so .    </S>",
