    "the mathematical problem of spanning trees on a connected graph can be considered as a model of statistical mechanics and , as such , it is the first non - trivial exactly solved multidimensional problem thanks to the famous kirchhoff s theorem @xcite . in modern classification",
    ", the model belongs to the class of free - fermion models @xcite which admit determinant solutions .",
    "the spanning trees are associated with a variety of models , such as the abelian sandpile @xcite , hamiltonian walks on the manhattan lattice and dense polymer models @xcite .",
    "the enumeration of spanning trees on the two - dimensional square lattice is equivalent to the close packed dimer problem solved by kasteleyn @xcite and temperley and fisher @xcite . in the scaling limit",
    ", correlation properties of the spanning trees can be described by the conformal field theory with central charge @xmath0 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the simplest generalization of spanning trees are the spanning webs , spanning subgraphs of a connected graph containing cycles together with tree branches attached to them @xcite .",
    "there are two sources for the appearance of topologically different classes of cycles in models associated with spanning trees .",
    "first , periodic boundary conditions in at least one spatial dimension generate cycles .",
    "such cycles appear in the exact solutions of the dimer problem on lattices wrapped on a cylinder or torus @xcite and they are _ non - contractible _ to a point in the embedding surface .",
    "second , lattice defects like monomers in a dense dimer packing give rise to a different kind of _ contractible _ cycles @xcite .",
    "in general , the spanning web model does not belong to the free fermion class and , moreover , it is not exactly solvable .",
    "however , for particular geometries of the cycles and appropriate statistical weights of the configurations it retains the free - fermion properties .    in this paper we calculate the partition function of a spanning web model on a finite cylinder by considering the number of cycles winding around the cylinder as a parameter .",
    "our aim is to evaluate the leading finite - size corrections to the free energy in the limit of large perimeter of the cylinder . in the absence of cycles",
    "the finite - size effects of the spanning tree model confirm predictions of the logarithmic conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "we show that the presence of cycles changes the casimir effect in accordance with conformal weights which appear in the kac table @xcite .",
    "an example of exactly solvable logarithmic models with conformal boundary conditions has been given recently by pearce and rasmussen @xcite .",
    "they considered critical dense polymers with certain types of defects on a strip and reproduced the conformal weights in the first column of the extended kac table .",
    "their results were obtained by means of a functional equation for commuting transfer matrices , formulated in terms of the planar temperley - lieb algebra .    despite the similarity between dense polymers at the free fermion point and spanning trees on an auxiliary sublattice ,",
    "the classification of conformal weights in these two models is quite different .",
    "the entries of the kac table for the model of dense polymers are labeled by the number of `` defect '' lines @xcite under fixed boundary conditions at both sides of the strip .",
    "we will show that the cycles in the spanning webs play the role of pairs of defect lines in the model of dense polymers .",
    "however , in our case the boundary conditions are different for the odd and even entries in the first column of the kac table .",
    "some complication of the boundary conditions is the fee to be paid for simplicity of derivation of the partition function of the spanning web model .",
    "analytical calculations in sections ii and iii are reduced to the standard determinant expressions for the free fermion model with subsequent analysis by use of the euler - maclaurin formula . in section",
    "iv we show that the partition function calculated for a finite lattice with different boundary conditions coincides with the characters of coinvariants calculated in different modules for the algebra of symplectic fermions .",
    "this allows us to identify open and closed boundary conditions with modules generated by integer and half - integer modes of fermions respectively .",
    "we consider the labeled graph @xmath1 with vertex set @xmath2 and set of bonds @xmath3 .",
    "the vertices are sites of the square lattice @xmath4 from which we obtain a graph on a cylinder by identifying @xmath5 and @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",
    "the graph @xmath8 represents a finite square lattice embedded in a cylinder of height @xmath9 and perimeter @xmath10 , with closed boundary conditions at the top and bottom edges .",
    "the term closed means the absence of bonds connecting vertices of @xmath2 with an exterior of @xmath8 .",
    "we shall consider also the case of open boundary conditions at the vertices @xmath11 belonging to one of the edges @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the cylinder , or to both of them .",
    "these cases correspond to a graph @xmath14 with vertex set @xmath15 containing an additional vertex , the root @xmath16 , and the set of bonds @xmath17 enlarged with the bonds connecting the vertices of @xmath18 with the root @xmath16 . for convenience of notation",
    "we label the boundary conditions by the superscript @xmath19 : @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) denotes closed ( open ) top boundary and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) closed ( open ) bottom boundary , respectively .",
    "we find it convenient to construct the desired spanning web configurations on the above graphs by using the arrow representation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "accordingly , to each vertex @xmath24 we attach an arrow directed along one of the bonds @xmath25 incident to it .",
    "each arrow defines a directed bond @xmath26 and each configuration of arrows @xmath27 on @xmath8 defines a spanning directed graph ( digraph ) @xmath28 with set of bonds @xmath29 depending on @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , the arrow configurations on @xmath30 define a spanning digraph @xmath31 with set of bonds @xmath32 .",
    "note that no arrow is attached to vertex @xmath16 , thus it has out - degree zero .",
    "a cycle of length @xmath33 is a sequence of directed bonds @xmath34 where all @xmath35 , @xmath36 are distinct .",
    "if both @xmath26 and @xmath37 belong to the spanning web we say that it contains a cycle of length 2 .",
    "our aim is to study sets of spanning digraphs with no other cycles than those which wrap the cylinder .",
    "the relevant configurations will be enumerated with the aid of a generating function defined as the determinant of an appropriately constructed weight matrix .",
    "we begin with the examination of the determinant expansion of the usual laplace matrix @xmath38 for the graph @xmath8 .",
    "let the vertices of the set @xmath2 be labeled in arbitrarily order from 1 to @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath38 has the elements ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the order of vertex @xmath43 . since the matrix @xmath38 has a zero eigenvalue , its determinant vanishes .",
    "on the other hand , the leibniz formula expresses the determinant of @xmath38 as a sum over all permutations @xmath44 of the set @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the symmetric group , @xmath48 is the signature of the permutation @xmath44 .",
    "the identity permutation @xmath49 in ( [ leibniz ] ) yields the term @xmath50 equal to the number of all possible arrow configurations on @xmath8 .",
    "in general , each permutation @xmath51 can be factored into a product ( composition ) of disjoint cyclic permutations , say , @xmath52 .",
    "this representation partitions the set of vertices @xmath2 into non - empty disjoint subsets - the orbits @xmath53 of the corresponding cycles",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 . more precisely , if @xmath56 is the orbit of @xmath54 , then @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the cardinality of the orbit @xmath53 , equivalently , the length of the cycle @xmath54 .",
    "the orbits consisting of just one element , if any , constitute the set @xmath60 of fixed points of the permutation : @xmath61 . in the case of the identity permutation",
    "@xmath62 all orbits consist of exactly one element , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "a cycle @xmath54 of length @xmath66 will be called a _",
    "proper cycle_. a proper cycle of length 2 corresponds to two oppositely directed edges which connect a pair of adjacent vertices : @xmath67 , @xmath68 . note that the vertices of an orbit @xmath53 of cardinality @xmath69 are connected by a closed path on @xmath8 which can be traversed in two opposite directions :",
    "if @xmath54 is the cycle defined by @xmath70 , then the reverse cycle @xmath71 can be represented as @xmath72 .",
    "now we take into account that the proper cycles on @xmath8 are of even length only , hence , the signature of every permutation in the expansion of the determinant depends on the number of proper cycles in its factorization , i.e. , if @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , then @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the terms in eq .",
    "( [ leibniz ] ) can be rearranged according to the number @xmath77 of disjoint proper cycles as follows : _",
    "i=1^n z_i = _ p=1^[n/2 ] ( -1)^p+1 _ = c_1 c_p _ i=1^p _ v_i , c_i(v_i ) _ c_i(v_i),c_i^2(v_i)_c_i^l_i -1(v_i),v_i_js_fp()z_j .",
    "[ altern ] here @xmath78 is the @xmath33-fold composition of the cyclic permutation @xmath54 of even length @xmath59 , @xmath79 , so that @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "note that all non - vanishing off - diagonal elements are equal to @xmath82 .",
    "the above expansion reveals the following features : ( i ) as expected , all spanning digraphs on @xmath8 have at least one proper cycle ; ( ii ) each term on the right - hand side with @xmath83 represents a set of @xmath84 distinct spanning digraphs which have in common the specified cycles @xmath85 , and differ in the oriented edges outgoing from the vertices @xmath86 .",
    "these oriented edges may form cycles on their own which do not enter into the list @xmath85 ; ( iii ) since the sets @xmath87 and @xmath88 are disjoint , the proper cycles formed by the oriented edges incident to the fixed points of a given permutation @xmath89 should enter into the enlarged list of cycles @xmath90 , @xmath91 , corresponding to the cycle decomposition of another permutation @xmath92 .",
    "for example , consider the determinant of the laplacian matrix of a cylinder of height 3 and perimeter 4 . in the case of closed boundary conditions",
    ", the corresponding leibniz expansion will contain the term @xmath93 which represents , up to the sign , @xmath94 spanning digraphs on @xmath8 with 3 specified cycles and all possible oriented bonds outgoing from the vertices 2 and 6 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "one of these 12 spanning digraphs will contain the additional cycle @xmath95 .",
    "in the case of open boundary at the bottom and closed at the top , the term @xmath96 represents @xmath97 spanning digraphs on @xmath30 with 2 specified cycles and all possible oriented bonds outgoing from the vertices 2 , 3 , 4 and 8 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the latter bonds will generate three digraphs with one additional cycle of length 2 : @xmath98 , or @xmath99 , or @xmath100 , and one digraph with two additional cycles , @xmath98 and @xmath101 .",
    "as noticed first in @xcite , the expansion ( [ altern ] ) parallels in form the _ inclusion - exclusion principle _ in combinatorial mathematics .",

    "define @xmath103 , @xmath104 as the set of all spanning digraphs on @xmath8 containing the particular cycle @xmath54 .",
    "then , expansion ( [ altern ] ) can be written in the form of the inclusion - exclusion principle : @xmath105 which holds for any finite sets @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the cardinality of the set @xmath108 .",

    "the elements @xmath111 of @xmath109 are explicitly given as : @xmath112    here @xmath113 , the terms `` left '' and `` right '' fix the opposite directions of the horizontal edges .",
    "note that all closed paths which do not wrap the cylinder contain an equal number of horizontal edges with either orientations , hence , their weight in @xmath110 remains the same as in @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , all the configurations which contain such closed paths ( contractible cycles ) cancel out in the expansion of @xmath115 . on the other hand , cycles generated by off - diagonal elements that wrap",
    "the cylinder change their sign , because they contain horizontal edges oriented in one direction exceeding by @xmath10 the number of edges in the opposite direction .",
    "this amounts to the total factor of @xmath116 , or @xmath117 depending on the orientation .",
    "therefore , each non - contractible cycle with a given orientation is counted twice , however , with different weight - once it enters into the determinant expansion with unit weight , being generated by diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath109 , and second time it enters with a factor @xmath118 or @xmath119 ( depending on the orientation ) as generated by off - diagonal elements of that matrix .",
    "thus , the total number of non - contractible cycles , irrespective of their origin and orientation , is given by the coefficient in front of the corresponding power of @xmath120 in the series expansion of the partition function .",
    "the power of @xmath121 is the `` good quantum number '' which is a well defined and conserved quantity under the action of the transfer matrix along the cylinder .",
    "however , as we shall see below , more convenient expansions of the partition function , which can be directly compared with characters of the virasoro modules , are given by the power series in @xmath118 itself , or in terms of combinations like @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "in general , besides the non - contractible cycles , the spanning digraph contains tree subgraphs connected to them .",
    "all branches of the trees can be generated only by the diagonal elements of @xmath109 and , hence , carry unit weight .",
    "the laplacian matrix @xmath124 for the graph @xmath30 corresponding to @xmath125 boundary conditions is a @xmath126 matrix of the same form ( [ laplacian ] ) as far as the notions of degree of a vertex and adjacency are understood in the context of @xmath30 .",
    "however , to make the similarities and dissimilarities with the former case apparent , we retain the notation @xmath42 for the degree of vertex @xmath43 , @xmath127 , with respect to @xmath8 , and explicitly introduce the label @xmath16 for the root with degree @xmath10 in @xmath30 , see fig .",
    "( [ looptree ] ) b. thus , for the matrix elements of @xmath124 we have @xmath128    here @xmath18 is the set of bottom boundary vertices adjacent to the root @xmath16 in @xmath30 .",
    "now we make use of the fact that by kirchhoff s theorem the number @xmath129 of spanning trees on @xmath30 is equal to any cofactor of @xmath124 and chose for convenience the cofactor @xmath130 of the element @xmath131 .",

    "therefore , the same arguments as in the previous section lead us to the matrix @xmath141 with elements @xmath142 where , as before , @xmath113 . by construction , in the expansion of @xmath143 all the arrow configurations with contractible cycles cancel out .",

    "regarding the conservation law in the system of dense polymers , one notices that the transfer matrices used in @xcite have a block triangular structure .",
    "this structure reflects the fact that defect lines can be annihilated in pairs and , therefore , the number of defects is not conserved . imbedding the system into the cylinder geometry , which is the case of our model , is equivalent to taking the trace of a transfer matrix , hence , the number of non - contractible cycles ( or defect lines in the case of dense polymers ) becomes automatically fixed .",
    "the simple geometry of the cylinder with closed or open boundary conditions on the edges allows an elementary evaluation of the partition function by using an extension of the kirchhoff theorem .",
    "the second and more important feature of the spanning webs model consists in the perfect coincidence of the universal part of its partition function @xmath318 for different combinations of closed and open boundary conditions , @xmath319 and @xmath320 , with the finitized characters of the symplectic fermions , see ( [ chi ] ) .",
    "this allows us to interpret the simplectic fermion model as a conformal field theory of spanning webs on a cylinder .",
    "the further identification of the triplet @xmath304 algebra in terms of spanning webs is an interesting open problem .",
    "another problem for future investigation is the explicit construction of virasoro representations with finitized characters given by eqs .",
    "( 36 ) - ( 38 ) .",
    "strictly speaking we have not proved the indecomposability of these virasoro representations .",
    "however , the structure of characters ( 36 ) - ( 38 ) gives indication that our model belongs to the universality class of the @xmath0 logarithmic conformal field theory ( lcft ) .",
    "an additional argument in support of the above conjecture provides the one - to - one correspondence between the recurrent configurations of the abelian sandpile model ( asm ) and the spanning trees on the square lattice @xcite . under this mapping the height variables of the asm correspond to nonlocal correlations in the spanning trees .",
