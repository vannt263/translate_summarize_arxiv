    "when a system is driven using a periodic protocol , dimensionless currents can be introduced that describe the fluxes per the driving period , rather than per unit time .",
    "the appearance of stochastic currents in response to periodic changes of parameters is generally referred to as the stochastic pump effect @xcite .",
    "statistical properties of such currents usually change continuously with changes of the shape of the parameter path .",
    "this is , to some degree , expected since usually small changes of kinetic rates in an ergodic markovian stochastic system , which consists of only a finite number of discrete states , do not lead to sharp changes of the system behavior .",
    "discrete changes of current characteristics can be usually achieved in stochastic systems either with formally infinite number of states or in the limit of low temperature @xcite when fluctuations are suppressed and noise can not smear the behavior near the points of parameter degeneracies . in this letter",
    ", we confront this view and demonstrate that some of the statistical characteristics of currents can depend discontinuously on the choice of the driving protocol , moreover , this property can be found in finite - size ergodic markov chains .",
    "consider a simple model illustrated in fig .  [ 2level ] : a particle can randomly jump between two sites along two paths .",
    "each path can be passed in both directions .",
    "we assume the system to be coupled to a heat bath at constant temperature , so that the kinetic rates , @xmath0 of transitions from state @xmath1 to the other state via the path @xmath2 , with ( @xmath3 ) , satisfy the detailed balance condition and can be parameterized as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the inverse temperature , whereas @xmath8 and @xmath9 are referred to as the @xmath1-th potential well energy and the @xmath2-th path potential barrier height , respectively .",
    "we will study the currents that circulate in a counterclockwise direction , see fig  [ 2level ] , under the action of a cyclic periodic perturbation .",
    "the currents are stochastic and , generally , can be characterized by two sets of probabilities @xmath10 that at time @xmath11 the system is at state @xmath1 , having performed @xmath12 transitions during the time segment @xmath13 $ ] through the link @xmath14 ( with the barrier @xmath15 ) , counting counterclock / clockwise transition with the @xmath16 sign , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we will notationally suppress the time parameter @xmath11 in @xmath10 and other variables .     and",
    "the two states are characterized by the values of their well depths , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "periodic modulation of these parameters leads to appearance of a nonzero , on average , circulating current in the preferred ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) direction .",
    ", width=192 ]    the master equation for @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 upon a fourier transform with respect to @xmath12 , eq .",
    "( [ master-2 ] ) translates into @xmath22 with the `` twisted '' evolution operator @xmath23 the averaged over the final state mgf @xmath24 that contains complete information on the current distribution function , including the statistics of rare events , is obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ master-3 ] ) and can be expressed in terms of a time - ordered exponential @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the vector of the initial system populations .",
    "the lowest current cumulants are described by the properties of @xmath29 near the @xmath30 point , and their behavior in the limit of adiabatically slow evolution of parameters is always defined by the eigenvalue of @xmath28 with the largest real part and the corresponding eigenvector @xcite . in the vicinity of @xmath30 ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath28 are nondegenerate , provided all kinetic rates in ( [ ham2 ] ) are nonzero ( finite temperature ) .",
    "this follows from an observation that @xmath31 describes the evolution of probabilities in a 2-state markov chain @xcite .",
    "such an evolution matrix has a unique zero - mode solution corresponding to the unique steady state of an ergodic markov chain .",
    "this uniqueness guarantees that the eigenvalue of @xmath28 with the largest real part is nondegenerate for sufficiently small @xmath32",
    ".    we will study the effect of geometric phases on the full counting statistics of currents that does not apparently appear when only lowest cumulants of the current distribution are measured , namely , the matrix ( [ ham2 ] ) has a unique point in the parameter space , where its eigenvalues are degenerate .",
    "this happens when simultaneously three conditions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are satisfied , which can be seen by explicitly inspecting the eigenvalue problem for the @xmath36 matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the degeneracy conditions do not depend on the inverse temperature @xmath37 .",
    "the fact that the degeneracy point is encountered at a finite value of the counting parameter , @xmath33 , means that it influences the properties of the full counting statistics , rather than the lowest cumulants of the current distribution .",
    "we note also that at @xmath33 the matrix @xmath38 has all real entries .",
    "the mgf at @xmath33 , @xmath39 has a simple physical meaning , namely , it is the difference of the probabilities @xmath40 and @xmath41 to make an even and odd number of transitions through a given link , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath42 must be influenced by the presence of the degeneracy point .",
    "the evolution operator @xmath38 has two nonpositive eigenvalues @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 . near their degeneracy point , we parameterize @xmath46 and @xmath47 which yields @xmath48 for the eigenvalues in the limit @xmath49 , @xmath50 . the eigenvalues as functions of @xmath51 lie on a two - cone surface . taking the higher eigenvalue @xmath52 ,",
    "the eigenstate @xmath53 , determined by solving a @xmath36 linear problem , has a form @xmath54 with @xmath55 being an arbitrary periodic function of @xmath56 .",
    "the requirement on the eigenstate not to be zero imposes that @xmath55 is either strictly positive or strictly negative function , however , the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 change the sign when changing @xmath56 around a full cycle .",
    "if one chooses the smooth field of eigenstates of @xmath38 over the space of all possible values of parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 , except the degeneracy point , such a vector field has to be double - valued and , along a nonintersecting path around the degeneracy point , the eigenvectors of @xmath38 change the sign .",
    "to understand , how this effect can influence the stochastic currents , we should look at the evolution of mgf in response to externally induced periodic changes of kinetic rates in the model .",
    "when all parameters in the evolution operator are time - independent the time - ordered exponential in ( [ pdf2 ] ) becomes just a matrix exponent , which can be simplified by introducing the left and right eigenstates @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the matrix @xmath63 , corresponding to the eigenvalues in ( [ egnv ] ) .",
    "then ( [ pdf2 ] ) gives us @xmath64 since both eigenvalues @xmath65 are negative , the absolute value of @xmath42 decays exponentially with time . moreover , since @xmath66 , the term @xmath67 quickly becomes exponentially suppressed in compared to @xmath68 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath69 are totally determined by the initial probability distribution and kinetic rates .",
    "their values describe the initial relaxation processes to the steady state distribution and remain the same even if kinetic rates are changing with time adiabatically @xcite . at time",
    "scales larger than @xmath70 the sign of @xmath42 is determined by the sign of @xmath71 , which can be found and analyzed explicitly .",
    "depending on the initial choice of parameters , including initial state probabilities , @xmath71 can be either negative or positive , however , the sign of @xmath42 is fixed after the term with coefficient @xmath72 becomes exponentially suppressed . in other words ,",
    "the sign of @xmath42 is the invariant of the evolution which can take values in a discrete two - state set .",
    "we further ask a question whether the sign of @xmath42 can be switched by adiabatically slow evolution of parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 around a cycle . in the adiabatic limit",
    ", a naive strict quasi - steady - state approximation predicts that a slow perturbation merely modulates the decay exponents in ( [ stat ] ) and the vector @xmath75 is given by instantaneous eigenvector @xmath76 .",
    "this means that , in principle , the sign of @xmath42 can change during the evolution since the components of @xmath77 change with time and their sum can switch the sign .",
    "however , if the parameters complete a cycle , the initial and final eigenstates coincide , while the coefficient @xmath78 is time - independent . hence",
    ", one may not expect to find a sign change of @xmath42 at the end of the cycle .",
    "this analysis , however , does not include the effect of geometric phases , which can be non - perturbative @xcite .",
    "first , consider the case when a cyclic path in the space of control parameters does not enclose the point @xmath79 .",
    "we can always choose a smooth parametrization of the eigenvectors of @xmath38 in the region @xmath80 inside the contour .",
    ", @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the contour in the space of control parameters does not enclose the degeneracy point.,width=268 ]    according to @xcite , @xmath42 , after periodic and adiabatically slow evolution of the parameters around the contour @xmath85 during time @xmath86 , is given by @xmath87 where the geometric contribution to the exponent in ( [ geometric ] ) is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 or explicitly @xmath90    the eigenvalues @xmath91 and the geometric phase @xmath92 in ( [ geometric ] ) are both real , and therefore the exponential term does not affect the sign of @xmath42 .",
    "[ z2-smooth ] shows the results of our numerical solution of the evolution equation ( [ master-3 ] ) at @xmath33 .",
    "the fact that @xmath42 has the same sign during the whole evolution is not generic . generally , it can change but the fact that it does not change after each period of driving protocol is always confirmed if the contour does not enclose the degeneracy point . in other words ,",
    "the sign of @xmath42 is an invariant of an adiabatic change of parameters along a closed contour that does not enclose the degeneracy point .     in a driven 2-state stochastic system when a contour in the space of control parameters encloses the degeneracy point .",
    "the choice of parameters is @xmath93 , @xmath81 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath84 .",
    ", width=268 ]      we now consider the case when the contour is cyclic and encloses the degeneracy point @xmath79 . the previous arguments can not be applied directly since at the degeneracy point the adiabatic approximation breaks down and the parametrization of the eigenstates inside the contour can not be chosen smoothly .",
    "they do , however , imply that @xmath96 does not change upon deformations of @xmath85 that do not encounter the degeneracy point reducing our analysis to the contours , restricted to a small neighborhood of the degeneracy point .",
    "our analysis , in section 3 , of the vicinity of the crossing point showed that the smooth choice of eigenstates along a contour requires that , upon completion of the cycle , the eigenvector changes sign .",
    "physically , this change of sign means that the probability difference @xmath42 changes the sign .",
    "our numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ master-3 ] ) for evolution along a contour that encloses the degeneracy point , is shown in fig .",
    "[ z2-fin ] .",
    "it confirms the sign change prediction .",
    "note that this result is nonperturbative .",
    "it can not appear as an effect of small non - adiabatic corrections to the decaying exponent in ( [ geometric ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath97 is a topological factor rather than a geometric phase effect in a sense of ref .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ z2-fin ] that this factor does appear after an adiabatic cyclic evolution of the control parameters that enclose the degeneracy point . more generally this implies that @xmath98 with @xmath99 being the number of times the cycle @xmath85 winds around the degeneracy point .",
    "this property provides an approach to manipulate this sign with high robustness against perturbations of a driving protocol .",
    "the sign of the probability difference in ( [ zpi ] ) is , in fact , a topological invariant of the driving protocol , the latter being viewed as a cycle in the space @xmath100 of parameters @xmath101 where degeneracy of @xmath102 never occurs . by associating with @xmath103 the ground state of @xmath102 , the former defined up to a real multiplicative factor , we build a linear real fiber bundle @xmath104 over @xmath105 , or equivalently a map @xmath106 . here the projective space @xmath107 is interpreted as a circle @xmath108 of `` normalized states '' @xmath109 with the opposite points on the circle identified , since there is no preferred way to define the sign of the ground state .",
    "the map @xmath110 associates with a driving protocol @xmath85 a cycle @xmath111 in @xmath112 , and each time @xmath85 winds around the degeneracy point , @xmath111 produces a single rotation in @xmath107 , so that @xmath113 .",
    "the last statement can be reformulated in terms of the first stiefel - whitney class @xmath114 @xcite of @xmath104 that can be viewed as a @xmath115-valued function on cycles in @xmath105 , so that @xmath116 and the invariant @xmath117 of the counting statistics is obtained by evaluating the stiefel - whitney class at the driving protocol .    in this letter we studied in some detail a @xmath115-invariant in a simple @xmath118-node system . in a general network represented by a finite connected graph",
    "there is a set of invariants , we are going to describe briefly here , with the analysis of the general case postponed to a further publication . with any `` independent '' set @xmath119 of links ( i.e.",
    ", if they are all withdrawn the network still remains connected ) we can associate a @xmath115-valued observable @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is a set of binary variables , and @xmath122 is the joint probability that for protocol @xmath85 the total number of jumps over link @xmath123 was even / odd for @xmath124 respectively .",
    "the protocol is assumed to go through the space @xmath125 of parameters that avoid the ground - state degeneracy of the twisted operator @xmath126 , with @xmath127 for chosen links @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , otherwise .",
    "similar to the simple two - node case the ground state defines a linear bundle @xmath130 over @xmath125 with the first stiefel - whitney class @xmath131 , or equivalently a map @xmath132 with @xmath133 being the number of nodes in the network .",
    "viewing @xmath134 as an @xmath135-sphere with opposite points identified we have a two - fold cover @xmath136 . since all cycles in @xmath137",
    "are contractible , there are two equivalence classes of cycles @xmath138 in the projective space : the ones produced by cycles in @xmath137 and the ones produced by contours that connect opposite points in @xmath137 ; this is referred to as @xmath139=0 $ ] and @xmath139=1 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the topological factor associated with a driving protocol is given by @xmath140}=(-1)^{c_{1}({\\bm c})}$ ] so that the counting - statistics invariant @xmath141 , with @xmath71 depending on the initial distribution only , being independent of the driving protocol .",
    "the topological factor is very similar to the topological berry phase in quantum mechanics of systems with time - reversal symmetry ( no magnetic fields ) , where @xmath142 is a family of hamiltonians , represented by real hermitian operators @xcite . in our case",
    "the operators are real , however , apparently non - hermitian .",
    "they are in fact hermitian with respect to a scalar product that depends on the kinetic rates .",
    "the latter results in the geometric contribution @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ geometric ] ) that does not affect @xmath96 .",
    "we demonstrated that some of the properties of the full counting statistics of currents in finite size stochastic models can be controlled by periodic changes of the control parameters without continuous dependence of the result of operation on the choice of the path in the parameter space .",
    "this finding reveals the importance of the degeneracy points of the eigenvalues of @xmath28 , governing the evolution of the current mgf .",
    "although the effect is the property of the full counting statistics @xcite , it is measurable experimentally , since the probabilities of rare events in the considered model are suppressed at least exponentially . as a result ,",
    "only a finite number of terms in the definition of the parity difference ( [ zpi ] ) should be determined , which is achievable by repeating the measurement of the number of transition through a link after sufficiently many cycles .",
    "the simplicity of our model suggests that the topological geometric factors could be a generic property of current statistics .",
    "the phenomena that they represent in general situations of multistate or langevin evolution can be much more complex than the sign switching that we demonstrated .",
