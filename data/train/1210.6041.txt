    "on 2010 june 15 ( hjd@xmath6 5362.967 @xmath7 hjd@xmath8 ) , the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) collaboration @xcite detected a new microlensing event moa-2010-blg-310 at ( r.a .",
    ", decl . ) = ( 18@xmath908@xmath1049.-2pt@xmath1198 , -25@xmath12 ) ( j2000.0 ) , ( l , b ) = ( 5.17 , -2.96 ) , along our line of sight toward the galactic bulge .",
    "moa announced the event through its email alert system and made the data available in real - time . within a day",
    ", this event was identified as likely to reach high magnification .",
    "because of moa s real - time alert system , the event was identified sufficiently far in advance to allow intensive follow up observations over the peak .",
    "the observational data were acquired from multiple observatories , including members of the moa , ogle , @xmath13fun , planet , robonet @xcite , and mindstep collaborations . in total , sixteen observatories monitored the event for more than one night , and thus their data were used in the following analysis . among these , there is the moa survey telescope ( 1.8 m , moa - red - band ] , new zealand ) and the b&c telescope ( 60 cm , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , new zealand ) ; eight of the observatories are from @xmath13fun : auckland ( ao , 0.4 m , wratten # 12 , new zealand ) , bronberg ( 0.36 m , unfiltered , south africa ) , ctio smarts ( 1.3 m , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , chile ) , farm cove ( fco , 0.36 m , unfiltered , new zealand ) , kumeu ( 0.36 m , unfiltered , new zealand ) , molehill ( mao , 0.3 m , unfiltered , new zealand ) , vintage lane ( vlo , 0.4 m , unfiltered , new zealand ) , and wise ( 0.46 m , unfiltered , israel ) ; three are from planet : kuiper telescope on mt .",
    "bigelow ( 1.55 m , @xmath15 , arizona ) , canopus ( 1.0 m , @xmath15 , australia ) , and saao ( 1.0 m , @xmath15 , south africa ) ; one is from robonet : liverpool ( 2.0 m , @xmath15 , canaries ) ; and one is from mindstep : la silla ( 1.5 m , @xmath15 , chile ) .",
    "the event also fell in the footprint of the ogle iv survey ( 1.3 m , @xmath15 , chile ) , which was in the commissioning phase in 2010 .",
    "the observatory and filter information is summarized in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "in particular , observations from the moa survey telescope , moa b&c , planet canopus , @xmath13fun  bronberg , and @xmath13fun  vlo provided nearly complete coverage over the event peak between hjd@xmath17 and hjd@xmath18 .      the moa and b&c data were reduced with the standard moa pipeline @xcite .",
    "the data from the @xmath13fun  observatories were reduced using the standard dophot reduction @xcite , with the exception of bronberg and vlo data , which were reduced using difference image analysis ( dia ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "data from the planet and robonet collaborations were reduced using pysis2 pipeline @xcite .",
    "data from mindstep were also initially reduced using the pysis2 pipeline .",
    "the ogle data were reduced using the standard ogle pipeline @xcite .",
    "both the moa and mindstep / la silla data were reduced in real - time , and as such the initial reductions were sub - optimal .",
    "in fact , the original moa data over the peak were unusable because they were corrupted .",
    "after the initial analysis , both the mindstep and moa data were rereduced using optimized parameters .",
    "to determine the intrinsic source color , we construct a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the field of view containing the lensing event ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) based on @xmath14- and @xmath15-band images from ctio smarts andicam camera .",
    "the field stars in the cmd are determined from three @xmath14-band images and multiple @xmath15-band images .",
    "four @xmath14-band images were taken ; however , only three of the images are of sufficient quality to contribute to the cmd .",
    "we visually checked each of the three images to make sure that there were no obvious defects such as cosmic - ray events in the images .    from the fit to the light curve , we find the instrumental magnitude of the source is @xmath19 with an uncertainty of 0.05 mag due to differences between the planet and point lens models as well as the error parameterizations . in the top right - hand corner of figure  [ fig : cmd ] , the red dot at @xmath20 marks the centroid of the red clump .",
    "the intrinsic color and magnitude of the clump are @xmath21 @xcite . using the offset between the intrinsic magnitude of the clump and",
    "the observed , instrumental magnitude , we can then calibrate the magnitude of the source to find @xmath22 .",
    "the color of the source is normally estimated from @xmath14- and @xmath15-band images using the standard technique in @xcite . however , with only one highly - magnified @xmath14-band image , this method is unreliable , so we use an alternative technique to determine the instrumental @xmath23 color by converting from the instrumental @xmath24 color . using the simultaneous ctio @xmath15- and @xmath16-band observations , we measure the instrumental @xmath24 color of the source by linear regression of @xmath16 on @xmath15 flux at various magnifications during the event .",
    "we then construct a @xmath25 instrumental color - color diagram from stars in the field ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "the stars are chosen to be all stars seen in all three bands with instrumental magnitude brighter than @xmath26 ( note that the field of view for @xmath16-band observations is @xmath27 compared to @xmath28 for the optical bands ) .",
    "the field stars form a well defined track , which enables us to estimate the @xmath23 source color from the observed @xmath24 source color .",
    "this yields @xmath29 .",
    "note that this method would not work for red stars , @xmath30 , because for these red stars , the @xmath25 relation differs between giants and dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , the observed color is well blueward of this bifurcation .",
    "there is also a spectrum of the source taken at hjd@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the `` spectroscopic '' @xmath32 reported in that work is 0.77 , in good agreement with the value calculated here .",
    "a casual inspection of the light curve does not show any deviations from a point lens , so we begin by fitting a point lens model to the data .",
    "a point lens model is characterized by three basic parameters : the time of the peak , @xmath33 , the impact parameter between the source and the lens stars , @xmath34 , and the einstein timescale , @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath34 is small , the finite size of the source can be important . to include this effect",
    ", we introduce the source size in einstein radii , @xmath36 , as a parameter in the model .",
    "additionally , we include limb - darkening of the source .",
    "the temperature of this slightly evolved source was determined from the spectrum to be @xmath37 5460 k by @xcite .",
    "using @xcite we found the limb - darkening coefficients to be @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , assuming a microturbulent velocity = 1 km s@xmath41 , log @xmath42 = 4.0 , solar metallicity , and @xmath43k , which is the closest grid point given the @xcite measurements .",
    "we then convert @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 to the form introduced by @xcite @xmath47 to obtain @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . because the various data sets are not on a common flux scale , there are also two flux parameters for each data set , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the predicted magnification of the model at time , @xmath55 , and includes the appropriate limb - darkening for data set @xmath56 .",
    "the source flux is given by @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the flux of all other stars , including any light from the lens , blended into the psf ( i.e. , the `` blend '' ) .",
    "as is frequently the case for microlensing data , the initial point lens fit reveals that the errors calculated for each data point by the photometry packages underestimate the true errors . additionally , there are be outliers in the data that are clearly seen to be spurious by comparison to other data taken simultaneously from a different site",
    "simply taking the error bars at face value would lead to biases in the modeling . because the level of systematics varies between different data sets , underestimated error bars",
    "can give undue weight to a particular set of data .",
    "additionally , if the errors are underestimated , the relative @xmath59 between two models will be overestimated , making the constraints seem stronger than they actually are .    to resolve these issues ,",
    "we rescale the error bars using an error renormalization factor ( or factors ) and eliminate outliers .",
    "we begin by fitting the data to a point lens to find the error renormalization factors .",
    "we remove the outliers according to the procedure described below based on the renormalized errors , refit , and recalculate the error renormalization factors .",
    "we repeat this process until no further outliers are found .",
    "to first order , we can compensate for the underestimated error bars by rescaling them by a single factor , @xmath60 .",
    "the rescaling factor is chosen for each data set , @xmath56 , such that @xmath61 , producing a @xmath62 per degree of freedom of @xmath63 .",
    "we will refer to this simple scheme for renormalizing the errors as `` 1-parameter errors '' .",
    "alternatively , we can use a more complex method to renormalize the errors , which we will call `` 2-parameter errors '' .",
    "this method was also used in @xcite and @xcite . to renormalize the errors",
    ", we rank order the data by magnification and calculate two factors , @xmath60 and @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the original error bar and @xmath67 is the new error bar and the calculations are done in magnitudes .",
    "the index @xmath56 refers to a particular data set , and @xmath68 refers to a particular point within that data set .",
    "the additional term , @xmath69 , enforces a minimum uncertainty in magnitudes , because at high magnification , the flux is large , so the formal errors on the measurement can be unrealistically small .",
    "the error factors , @xmath60 and @xmath64 , are chosen so that @xmath70 for points sorted by magnification increases in a uniform , linear fashion and @xmath63 @xcite . not all data sets will require an @xmath64 term ; it is only necessary in cases for which @xmath70 has a break because the formal errors are too small when the event is bright .",
    "note that the @xmath64 factor will be primarily affected by the points taken when the event is bright , whereas @xmath60 is affected by all points , so if there are many more points at the baseline of the event , these will dominate the calculation of @xmath60 .    to remove outliers in the data we begin by eliminating any points taken at airmass @xmath71 or during twilight .",
    "additional outliers are defined as any point more than @xmath72 from the expected value , where @xmath73 is determined by the number of data points , such that fewer than one point is expected to be more than @xmath72 from the expected value assuming a gaussian error distribution .",
    "the normal procedure is to compare the data to the `` expected value '' from a point lens fit .",
    "we do this for data in the wings of the event , @xmath74hjd@xmath75 or @xmath74hjd@xmath76 , when we do not expect to see any real signals .",
    "however , the peak of the event , @xmath77hjd@xmath78 , is when we would expect to see a signal from a planet if one exists .",
    "a planetary signal would necessarily deviate from the expectation for a point lens , so in this region instead of comparing to a point lens model , we use the following procedure to identify outliers :    1 .",
    "for each point , we determine whether there are points from any other data set within 0.01 days .",
    "if there are more than two points from a given comparison dataset in this range , we keep only the point(s ) immediately before and/or after the time of the point in question ( i.e. , a maximum of 2 points ) .",
    "the point is not compared to other points from the same data set.[step3 ] 2 .",
    "if there are matches to at least two other data sets , we proceed to ( [ step6 ] ) to determine whether or not the point is an outlier .",
    "otherwise , we treat the point as good .",
    "we then determine the mean of the collected points , @xmath13 , including the point in question , by maximizing a likelihood function for data with outliers @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the datum and @xmath82 is its renormalized error bar .",
    "if the flux is changing too rapidly for the points to be described well by a mean , we fit a line to the data .",
    "[ step6 ] 4 .",
    "we compare the point to the predicted value , using the likelihood function to see if it is an outlier : + \\(a ) if there is only one likelihood maximum , we calculate @xmath83 . if @xmath84 , the point is rejected as an outlier .",
    "+ \\(b ) if there is more than one maximum , and the point in question falls in the range spanned by the maxima , we assume the point is good .",
    "if it falls outside the range , we calculate @xmath83 using the nearest maximum to determine @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath84 , we flag the point as an outlier .",
    "note that for this procedure , we use the point lens model values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 to place all of the data sets on a common flux scale .",
    "this procedure is more complicated than usual , but because we compare the points only to other data , rather than some unknown model , it provides an objective means to determine whether a point is an outlier without destroying real signals corroborated by other data .",
    "we also visually inspect each set of points to confirm that the algorithm works as expected .",
    "because finite source effects are significant in this event , one might expect slight differences among data sets due to the different filters , so as part of this visual inspection we also checked that this did not play a significant role",
    ".    for both 1-parameter and 2-parameter errors , table [ tab : data ] lists the error normalization factors and number of points for each observatory that survived the rejection process . which of these error parameterizations correctly describes the data depends on the nature of the underlying errors .",
    "in principle , the noise properties of the data are fully described by a covariance matrix of all data points , but we are unable to calculate such a matrix .",
    "instead , we have two different error parameterizations .",
    "the @xmath60 factor is calculated primarily based on baseline data for which statistical errors dominate . in contrast",
    ", the @xmath64 factor is heavily influenced by points at the peak of the event when systematic errors are important .",
    "thus , 2-parameter errors better reflect the systematic errors , whereas 1-parameter errors better reflect the statistical errors .",
    "correlated errors often have a major impact on our ability to determine whether or not the planetary signal in this event is real . we know that correlations in the microlensing data exist , but there has not been a systematic investigation of this in the microlensing literature .",
    "correlated errors ( red noise ) are generally thought of as reducing the sensitivity to signals , because successive points are not independent , giving related information .",
    "but in fact , sharp , short timescale signals are not degraded by correlated noise and may still be robustly detected .",
    "consider the case of a short - timescale signal superimposed on a long - timescale correlation .",
    "then a model may reproduce the short - timescale signal leading to an improvement in @xmath62 without actually passing through the data because of the overall offset caused by the correlations .",
    "now suppose that the correlated , red noise has a larger - amplitude than the white noise ( i.e. , statistically uncorrelated noise ) .",
    "if we set the error bars by the large - amplitude deviations , which is correct for long timescales for which the data are uncorrelated , the significance of the short timescale jump will be diluted , possibly to the point of being considered statistically insignificant .",
    "however , if the timescale of the signal is much shorter than the correlation length of the red noise , the significance of the signal should actually be judged against the white noise , since on that timescale , the red noise will only contribute a constant offset .    in this case , we expect the planetary signal to be quite short , so if the systematic noise is dominated by correlated errors , the noise should be better described by the 1-parameter errors . because the source in this event crosses the position of the lens and there are no obvious deviations due to a planet",
    ", we expect that any planetary signals will be due to very small caustics , which are detectable only at the limb - crossing times ( @xmath87 ) when the caustic passes onto and off - of the face of the source",
    ". therefore , the timescale of such a perturbation will be very short , equal to @xmath88 times the caustic size @xmath89 , which is @xmath90 minutes .",
    "in contrast , observed correlations in the microlensing data are typically on longer timescales , @xmath91hour@xmath92 ( based on our experience with microlensing data which are usually sampled with a frequency of @xmath93 minutes ) .",
    "hence , the timescale of the signal is likely to be less than the timescale of the correlated noise .    however , there are other sources of systematic errors that are unrelated to correlated noise such as flat - fielding errors .",
    "if such errors dominate over correlated noise , then the 2-parameter errors are a better description of the error bars over the peak .    because the systematic errors , correlated and uncorrelated , have not been studied in detail , we are unable to determine which is the dominant effect .",
    "hence , we are also unable to determine which error prescription better describes our data .",
    "we will begin by analyzing the light curve using 1-parameter errors .",
    "we will then discuss how the situation changes for 2-parameter errors .",
    "the best - fit point lens model and the uncertainties in the parameters are given in table [ tab : models1 ] .",
    "this model is shown in figure [ fig : lc ] , and the residuals to this fit are shown in figure [ fig : res ] .",
    "these exhibit no obvious deviations .",
    "these fits confirm that finite source effects are important , since @xmath36 is well measured and larger than the impact parameter , @xmath34 .",
    "we also fit a point lens model that includes the microlens parallax effect , which arises either from the orbital motion of the earth during the event or from the difference in sightlines from two or more observatories separated on the surface of the earth .",
    "microlens parallax enters as a vector quantity : @xmath94 .",
    "the addition of parallax can break the degeneracy between solutions with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , so we fit both cases .",
    "parallax does improve the fit beyond what is expected simply from adding 2 more free parameters and shows a preference for @xmath95 .",
    "however , we shall see in the next section that a planetary model without parallax produces an even better fit and adding parallax in addition to the planet gives only a small additional improvement .",
    "we search for 2-body models over a broad range of mass ratios , from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "for each value of @xmath99 , we chose a range for the projected separation between the two bodies , @xmath100 , for which the resulting caustic is smaller than @xmath36 and @xmath101 . for each combination of @xmath100 and @xmath99",
    ", we allow the angle of the source trajectory , @xmath102 , to vary , seeding each run with values of @xmath102 from 0 to 360 degrees in steps of 5 degrees . for our models",
    ", we use the map - making method of @xcite when the source is within two source radii of the position of the center of magnification . outside this time range",
    ", we use the hexadecapole or quadrupole approximations for the magnification @xcite .",
    "we used a markov chain monte carlo to find the best - fit parameters and uncertainties for each @xmath100 , @xmath99 combination .",
    "the grid search reveals an overall improvement in @xmath62 relative to the point lens model .",
    "we find three @xmath62 minima for different angles for the source trajectory .",
    "for central caustics with planetary mass ratios , the caustic is roughly triangular in shape with a fourth cusp where the short side of the triangle intersects the binary axis ; the three trajectories roughly correspond to the three major cusps of the caustic .",
    "an example caustic is shown in figure [ fig : traj ] along with the trajectories corresponding to the three minima .",
    "the angles of the three trajectories are approximately @xmath103 and 235 degrees , and we will refer to them as trajectories `` a '' , `` b '' , and `` c '' , respectively .    we then refine our grid of @xmath100 and @xmath99 around each of these three minima .",
    "we repeat these fits accounting for various microlensing degeneracies .",
    "first , we fit without parallax and assuming @xmath104 .",
    "then , we add parallax and fit both with @xmath95 and @xmath96 to see if this degeneracy is broken .",
    "finally , we fit 2-body lens models with @xmath105 and no parallax , since there is a well known microlensing degeneracy that takes @xmath106 .",
    "the best - fit solution has @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this reflects an improvement in @xmath62 of @xmath109 over the point lens solution .",
    "there is no preference for @xmath104 over @xmath105 , but trajectory c is preferred by @xmath110 over trajectories a and b. the parameters and their uncertainties for the planet fits are given in table [ tab : models1 ] .",
    "the mass ratio between the lens star and its companion is firmly in the planetary regime : @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , planetary mass ratios are clearly preferred over `` stellar '' mass ratios ( @xmath111 ) , which are disfavored by more than @xmath112 .",
    "parallax further improves the fit by only @xmath113 and has little effect on the other parameters .    to compare the point lens and planetary models , in figure [ fig : cumchi2 ] , we plot the `` @xmath62 residuals '' : the difference between the cumulative @xmath62 distribution and the expected value @xmath114 , i.e. each point",
    "is expected to contribute @xmath115 .",
    "for both the point lens and the planet fits , the distribution rises gradually over the peak of the event .",
    "this is expected since 1-parameter errors do not account for correlated noise . however , in the @xmath62 residuals for the point lens , there is a jump seen at the time of the first limb - crossing .",
    "this jump is even more pronounced when looking at the difference between the planet and point lens models .",
    "the jump is caused by moa data at the time of the limb - crossing that do not fit the point lens well , thereby causing an excess increase in @xmath62 .",
    "this is exactly the time when we expect to see planetary signals .",
    "finally , given the extreme finite source effects in this event , we might be concerned that uncertainties in the limb - darkening coefficients due to uncertainties in the source properties could influence our conclusions .",
    "the planetary signal has two components : a limb - crossing signal and an asymmetry .",
    "the limb - darkening could influence the first signal , but not the second . to check that the limb - darkening coefficients do not significantly influence our results ,",
    "we repeat the point lens fits allowing the limb - darkening coefficients to be free parameters . in all cases ( no parallax , parallax , 1-parameter or 2-parameter errors )",
    ", the improvement to the fit from free limb - darkeing is @xmath116 , much smaller than the planetary signal .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath117 decreases by @xmath118 , which is excluded by the measured source parameters .",
    "thus , we conclude that our treatment of the limb - darkening is reasonable .",
    "although @xmath119 appears to be significant , we are hesitant to claim a detection of a planet . the planetary signal is more or less equally divided between the jump at the first limb - crossing and a more gradual rise after the second limb - crossing ( see the third panel of fig . [",
    "fig : cumchi2 ] showing the difference between the point lens and planet models ) .",
    "one could argue that the gradual rise , due to a slight asymmetry in the planet light curve , could be influenced by large - scale correlations in the data . comparing figures [ fig : res ] and [ fig : cumchi2 ] shows that most of the signal at the first limb - crossing comes from only a few points .",
    "a careful examination of the residuals in figure [ fig : res ] shows that while the residuals to the planet model are smaller than for the point lens model , they are not zero , and the didactic residuals do not go neatly through the difference between the models as they do for moa-2008-blg-310 @xcite .",
    "hence , the evidence for the planet is not compelling .",
    "if we repeat the analysis using 2-parameter errors , we find a similar planetary solution , although the exact values of the parameters are slightly different compared to other nights at baseline .",
    "if the data from this night are removed , the remaining data predict a different solution with the planetary caustic crossing 18 days earlier . because this solution is pathological , we do not consider it further.[fn : awide ] ] .",
    "the total signal from the planet is significantly degraded for 2-parameter errors , with only @xmath120 between the best - fit planet and point lens models .",
    "table [ tab : models2 ] gives parameters for the complete set of point lens and planet fits for 2-parameter errors .",
    "the residuals and error bars over peak may be compared to 1-parameter errors in figure [ fig : res ] .",
    "we also show the @xmath62 residuals for 2-parameter errors in the bottom set of panels in figure [ fig : cumchi2 ] .",
    "they are more or less flat over the peak , showing that they track the data well in this region .",
    "the offset from zero is caused by systematics elsewhere in the light curve .",
    "the difference plot ( bottom - most panel ) shows that the planet fit is still an improvement over the point lens fit , but the signal from the planet at the first limb - crossing is much weaker .",
    "this is a natural consequence of 2-parameter errors , since the data at the peak of the event , where the planetary signal is seen , have much larger renormalized error bars than for 1-parameter errorshjd@xmath121 , when the main planetary signal is observed . ] .",
    "regardless of the error renormalization , this planetary signal is smaller than the @xmath59 of any securely detected high - magnification microlensing planet .",
    "previously , the smallest @xmath59 ever reported for a high - magnification event was for moa-2008-blg-310 with @xmath122 @xcite . @xcite discuss moa-2011-blg-293 , an event for which the authors argue the planet could have been detected from survey data alone with @xmath123 .",
    "however , although the planet is clearly detectable at this level , it is unclear with what confidence the authors would have claimed the detection of the planet in the absence of the additional followup data , which increases the significance of the detection to @xmath124 . at an even lower level , @xcite find that a planetary companion to the lens improves the fit to macho-98-blg-35 at @xmath125 , but they do not claim a detection . as previously mentioned , @xcite suggest the minimum `` detectable '' planet will have @xmath126 .",
    "however , this threshold has not been rigorously investigated ; the minimum @xmath59 could be smaller .",
    "because of the tenuous nature of the planetary signal , we do not claim to detect a planet in this event , but since including a planet in the fits significantly improves the @xmath62 , we will refer to this as a `` candidate '' planet .    finally , it is interesting to note that even though the @xmath59 for the planetary model is too small to be considered detectable , for both 1-parameter and 2-parameter errors the parameters of the planet ( @xmath100 and @xmath99 ) are well defined ( see tables [ tab : models1 ] and [ tab : models2 ] ) .",
    "central caustics can be degenerate , especially when they are much smaller than the source size , so we might expect a wide range of possible mass ratios in this case since the limb - crossings are not well - resolved @xcite .",
    "however , perhaps we should not be surprised that the planet parameters are well - constrained : both @xmath127 and @xmath128 are formally highly significant , which would plausibly lead to reasonable constraints on the parameters . in this case , because we believe that the signal could be caused by systematics , by the same token , the constraints on the parameters may be over - strong .",
    "we conjecture that the limb - crossing signal does not constrain @xmath99 and that this constraint actually comes from the asymmetry of the light curve , since small , central caustics due to planets are asymmetric whereas those due to binaries are not .",
    "because the source size , @xmath36 , is well measured , we can determine the size of the einstein ring , @xmath129 , and the relative proper motion between the source and the lens , @xmath130 from the following relations : @xmath131 keeping the limb - darkening parameters fixed , we find the best fit for the normalized source size to be @xmath132 for the planetary fits ; the value is comparable for the point lens fits .",

    "whether or not the lens star is a member of the cluster can be constrained by calculating the proper motion of the lens star .",
    "@xcite found a relative proper motion of ngc 6553 with respect to the bulge of @xmath149 mas yr@xmath41 .",
    "the typical motion of bulge stars is about @xmath150 corresponding to about @xmath151 given an estimated distance of 7.7 kpc toward the source along this line of sight ( @xmath152 ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the expected amplitude of the lens - source relative proper motion if the lens is a cluster member is @xmath153 , which is consistent with the measured value in section ( [ sec : temu ] ) .    combining the measurement of the stellar density with the proper motion information , we find the probability that the lens is a cluster member is considerably higher than the nominal value based only on stellar density .",
    "first , of order half the stars in the field are behind the source , whereas the lens must be in front of the source .",
    "second , the lens - source relative proper motion is consistent with what would be expected for a cluster lens at much better than @xmath154 , which is true for only about 2/3 of events seen toward the bulge .",
    "combining these two effects , we estimate a roughly 18% probability that the lens is a cluster member .",
    "one way to resolve this membership issue is by measuring the true proper motion of the lens as was done for a microlensing event in m22 for which the lens was confirmed to be a member of the globular cluster @xcite .",
    "for this event , we have calculated the relative proper motion of the lens and the source to be @xmath155 .",
    "this is consistent with the expected value if the lens were a member of the cluster .",
    "about 10 years after the event , the separation between the lens and the source star will be large enough to be measured with @xmath156 .",
    "based on this followup observation , one will be able to clarify whether the lens is a member of the cluster by measuring the vector proper motion . if it is a member of the cluster , its mass may be estimated from @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 is the source - lens relative parallax .",
    "in addition , the metallicity of the lens could be inferred from the metallicity of the globular cluster .",
    "we have found a candidate planet signal in moa-2010-blg-311 . the evidence in support of the planet is    1 .",
    "the planet substantially improves the fit to the data , 2 .",
    "in addition to a general improvement to the light curve , the planet produces a signal when we most expect it , i.e. the time of the first limb - crossing , 3 .   the solution has a well - defined mass ratio and projected separation for the planet ( excepting the well known @xmath160 degeneracy ) .",
    "the magnitude of the signal depends on whether the error bars are renormalized using 1-parameter ( @xmath128 ) or 2-parameter error factors ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "we conservatively adopt @xmath127 as the magnitude of the signal , but note that if correlated errors are the dominant source of systematic uncertainty , @xmath128 should be adopted instead ( see section [ sec : errors ] ) .",
    "regardless , this signal is too small to claim as a secure detection .    examining the residuals to the light curve and",
    "the @xmath62 residuals shows that the planetary signal is dispersed over many points at the peak of the light curve .",
    "it comes from an overall asymmetry near the peak plus a few points at the limb - crossing .",
    "because the signal is the sum of multiple cases of low - amplitude deviations , it is plausible that the microlensing model could be fitting systematics in the data , which is why the planet signal is not reliable .    combined with other studies , this event suggests that central - caustic ( high - magnification ) events and planetary - caustic events require different detection thresholds .",
    "the detection threshold suggested in @xcite of @xmath126 was made in the context of high - magnification events , and our experience so far is consistent with this .",
    "a planet was clearly detectable in moa-2008-blg-310 with @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite are uncertain if a planet would be claimed with @xmath123 for moa-2011-blg-293 . here , @xmath127 is definitely insufficient to detect a planet .",
    "hence , the detection threshold for planets in high - magnification events is around or just below @xmath123 .",
    "in contrast , the planetary caustic crossing in ogle-2005-blg-390 produced a clear signal of @xmath161 @xcite , and the planet would most likely be detectable if the error bars were 50% larger ( @xmath162 ) and might even be considered reliable if the error bars were twice as large .",
    "we suspect the reason for the different detection thresholds is that the information about the microlens parameters and the planetary parameters comes from different parts of the light curve . for planetary - caustic events ,",
    "the planet signal is a perturbation separated from the main peak .",
    "thus , the microlens parameters can be determined from the peak data independently from the planetary parameters , which are measured from the separate , planetary perturbation .",
    "in contrast , for high - magnification events , the planetary perturbation occurs at the peak of the event , so the microlens and planetary parameters must be determined from the same data .    the detection threshold for planetary - caustic events will have to be investigated in more detail .",
    "if it is truly lower than for high - magnification events , this is good news for second generation microlensing surveys since that is how most planets will be found in such surveys . at the same time",
    ", it points to the continued need for followup data of high - magnification events since these seem to have a higher threshold for detection , requiring more data to confidently claim a planet .",
    "this is an important consideration because high - magnification events can yield much more detailed information about the planets .",
    "additionally , @xcite show that the magnitude of the planetary signal should decrease as the ratio between the caustic size and the source size ( @xmath163 ) decreases for the same photometric precision ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "there are several cases of events for which @xmath164 : in this case , we have @xmath165 and @xmath128 ; the brown dwarf in moa-2009-blg-411l has @xmath166 and @xmath167 @xcite ; moa-2007-blg-400 has @xmath168 and @xmath169 @xcite ; and in the case of moa-2008-blg-310 , the value is @xmath170 with @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "this sequence is imperfect , but the photometry in the four cases is far from uniform , and it seems that in general the trend suggested by @xcite holds in practice .    finally , we note that a large fraction of the planet signal comes from the moa data , but in the original , real - time moa data , this signal would not have been detectable since the data were corrupted over the peak of the event .",
    "it is only after the data quality was improved by rereductions , which in turn were undertaken only because the event became the subject of a paper , that we recovered the planet candidate .",
    "this points to the importance of rereductions of the data when searching for small signals . in the current system of analyzing only the events with the most obvious signals ,",
    "this is not much of a concern .",
    "however , if current or future microlensing surveys are systematically analyzed to find signals of all sizes , this will become important .",

    "the @xmath23 color of the source is then derived from the intersection of this line with the @xmath23@xmath24 relation established by the field stars ( green squares ) , producing the black dot in the bottom panel .",

    "<S> @xcite suggest a detection threshold in the range of @xmath5350700 is required to both detect the signal and constrain it to be planetary , but they note that the exact value is unknown . with the advent of second - generation microlensing surveys , which will be able to detect planets as part of a controlled experiment with a fixed observing cadence , it is important to study the reliability of signals close to the detection threshold , since a systematic analysis of all events in such a survey will yield signals of all magnitudes , some of which will be real and some of which will be spurious .    in this paper , we present the analysis of a high - magnification microlensing event , moa-2010-blg-311 , which has a planetary signal slightly too small to claim as a detection . </S>",
