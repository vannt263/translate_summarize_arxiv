    "lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) can be formulated in many equivalent ways . the original wilson formulation is given in terms of group valued matrices on links as fundamental degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the partition function reads @xmath3 \\ } \\ ,   \\label{partfunc}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the standard wilson action and the integral is calculated over the haar measure on the group at every link of the lattice .",
    "several years later the dual representation for abelian lgt s was constructed in @xcite .",
    "extensions to nonabelian groups have been proposed in ninetees in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a closely related approach is so - called plaquette representation invented in the continuum theory by m.  halpern @xcite and extended to the lattice models in @xcite . in this representation",
    "the plaquette matrices play the role of the dynamical degrees of freedom and satisfy certain constraints expressed through bianchi identities .",
    "both dual and plaquette formulations are not so popular in the case of nonabelian models , probably due to their complexity . in the nonabelian case above mentioned constraints appear to be highly - nonlocal and this fact makes an analytical study of the model rather difficult . in spite of this complexity the plaquette formulation has certain advantages over the standard one @xcite : duality transformations , coulomb - gas representation , strong coupling expansion and mean - field approximation look more natural and simpler in the plaquette formulation .",
    "nevertheless we believe the main advantage of this formulation lies in its applications to the low - temperature region .",
    "let @xmath5 be a plaquette matrix in @xmath1 lgt .",
    "the rigorous result of @xcite asserts that the probability @xmath6 that @xmath7 is bounded by @xmath8 uniformly in the volume .",
    "thus , all configurations with @xmath9 are exponentially suppressed .",
    "the gibbs measure at large @xmath10 is strongly concentrated around configurations on which @xmath11 .",
    "this property justifies expansion of plaquette matrices around unity when @xmath10 is sufficiently large .",
    "this is our first motivation to construct a low - temperature expansion of gauge models using the plaquette formulation .",
    "the well - known problem of the standard perturbation theory ( pt ) can be shortly formulated as follows . when the volume is fixed , and in the complete axial gauge the link matrices perform small fluctuations around the unit matrix and the pt works very well producing the asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of @xmath10 .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) system deviates arbitrarily far from the ordered state , no saddle point exists anymore and configurations of link matrices are distributed uniformly in the group space . that there are problems with the conventional pt was proven in @xcite , where it was shown the pt results depend on the boundary conditions ( bc ) used to reach the tl .",
    "all this rises the question whether pt gives asymptotic expansion uniformly valid in the volume .",
    "fortunately , even in the tl the plaquette matrices are close to unity , the inequality ( [ chestplaq ] ) holds and thus provides a basis for the construction of the low - temperature expansion .",
    "our next motivation is to derive the dual representation of nonabelian models which could be used for their analytical study .",
    "here we formulate such representation for @xmath2 lgt and compute dual form of the t hooft loop .",
    "we also describe monopoles of the maximal axial gauge .",
    "now we outline the derivation of our plaquette formulation ( all technical details will be given in a forthcoming publication @xcite ) .",
    "consider a @xmath12 lattice with free bc on the link gauge matrices .",
    "we make a change of variables in the partition function ( [ partfunc ] ) @xmath13 .",
    "the partition function gets the form @xmath14 j(v_p ) \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath15 the last equations are rather formal , for we have to specify the order of multiplication of nonabelian matrices . to do that we define in a cube a vertex @xmath16 and separated by the space diagonal a vertex @xmath17 ,",
    "see fig.[connector ] .",
    "this assignment we extend for all neighbouring cubes and finally for the whole lattice .",
    "the plaquette matrices @xmath5 we insert at the vertices @xmath16 or @xmath17 of each plaquette attached to @xmath16 or @xmath17 , correspondingly .",
    "next , take a path connecting vertices @xmath16 and @xmath17 by three links , as shown in fig.[connector ] .",
    "then the matrix @xmath18 entering the bianchi identity for the cube @xmath19 is of the form @xmath20 =   \\left ( \\prod_{p \\in a } v_p \\right ) \\",
    "c    \\left ( \\prod_{p \\in b } v_p \\right ) \\",
    "c^{\\dag } \\ , \\",
    "c = u_{1 } u_{2 } u_{3}^{\\dag } \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath21 means an appropriately ordered product over three plaquettes of the cube attached to the vertex @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 defines a parallel transport of vertex @xmath17 into vertex @xmath16 and is called connector .",
    "the connector @xmath22 plays a crucial role in the nonabelian bianchi identity .",
    "its path can , in principle be chosen in an arbitrary way but the possible choices of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath22 must fit together .",
    "we choose the structure of connectors as shown in fig.[connector ] .    as is seen from fig.[connector ]",
    "there are four types of elementary cubes with different types of connector pathes .",
    "the next steps in the derivation are as follows :    i ) .",

    "ii ) . choose the maximal axial gauge in the form @xmath26 to simplify connectors one can fix the dirichlet bc in the plane @xmath27 .",
    "integrate out all link variables following @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we pass to the dual lattice where cubes become sites and so on .",
    "the partition function takes the form @xmath28 \\ \\prod_{i=1}^4   \\",
    "\\prod_{x(i ) } \\   j\\left ( v_x^{(i ) } \\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 runs over all sites with @xmath30-th type of connector pathes and @xmath31 is an @xmath1 delta - function given by @xmath32 where the sum over @xmath33 is a sum over all representations of @xmath1 , @xmath34 is character of @xmath33-th representation and @xmath35 .    to write down exact expressions we choose coordinate system on the dual lattice as in fig.[connector ] .",
    "then , e.g. the connector for the cube @xmath36 is @xmath37 @xmath38",
    "in this section we construct the low - temperature expansion of gauge models in the plaquette formulation . in doing this",
    "we follow the strategy developed for the two - dimensional principal chiral models in @xcite .",
    "the weak - coupling expansion in both models bears many common features . in the abelian case they turn out to be practically identical , while the only , but essential difference in the nonabelian case is the appearence of connectors in gauge models .",
    "the lattice pt in temporal gauge ( @xmath39 ) was constructed for abelian and nonabelian models in the standard wilson formulation by f.  mller and w.  rhl @xcite . in this gauge",
    "the pt for nonabelian models displays serious infrared divergences in separate terms of the expansion starting from the order @xmath40 for wilson loops and from @xmath41 for the free energy .",
    "although it is expected that all divergences are cancelled in gauge invariant quantities , we are not aware of any proof of the infrared finitness at higher orders of the expansion . here",
    "we outline the low - temperature expansion for @xmath2 lgt ( all details and extension to other groups will be given in @xcite ) .",
    "we want to expand the partition and correlation functions into asymptotic series whose coefficients are calculated over certain gaussian measure .",
    "let us consider the standard parameterization for the @xmath2 link matrix @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 are pauli matrices and introduce @xmath44^{1/2 } \\",
    "\\ , \\   w_x = \\left [ \\sum_k\\omega^2_k(x ) \\right]^{1/2 } , \\label{wp}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a site angle defined in ( [ ordprod ] ) and has the standard expansion @xmath46 in powers of link angles .",
    "the first coefficient can be written down as @xmath47 @xmath48 for @xmath49 can be computed by making repeated use of the campbell - baker - hausdorff formula .",
    "then , the partition function ( [ dualpart ] ) can be exactly rewritten to the following form @xcite @xmath50 \\exp \\left [ 2\\beta\\sum_l\\cos w_l \\right ] \\prod_x \\frac{w_x}{\\sin w_x } \\nonumber",

    "we have used the poisson formula . in order to perform the weak coupling expansion",
    "we make the substitution @xmath52 , @xmath53 and then expand the integrand of ( [ pfwk ] ) in powers of fluctuations of the link fields .",
    "introduce external sources @xmath54 coupled to the link field @xmath55 and @xmath56 coupled to the auxiliary field @xmath57 .",
    "then one can get the following expansion @xmath58 m(h , s ) \\ , \\label{appa1}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 are known operators .",
    "up to exponentially small terms the generating functional @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 \\ ,",
    "\\label{gffin}\\ ] ] where we introduced link green functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 defined as @xmath64 @xmath65 these formulae allow us to calculate the weak coupling expansion of both the free energy and any fixed - distance observable .",
    "extension of this expansion for @xmath1 lgt and for the wilson loop and other observables is straightforward .",
    "let us give some comments on the property of the expansion and on the infrared problem .",
    "one proves that the probability that @xmath66 links have large fluctuations like @xmath67 is suppressed as @xmath68 , @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "it shows that large fluctuations are under good control since they are exponentially suppressed with @xmath10 , and this obviously remains true in the tl .",
    "this property is very essential achievement of the expansion in the plaquette representation .",
    "no such controll exists for the large fluctuations of the link gauge matrices in the tl .",
    "it follows from the definition of the link green function ( [ gll1 ] ) that @xmath69 .",
    "hence , with respect to the gaussian measure fluctuations of link variables are bounded like @xmath70 this property justifies the low - temperature expansion in powers of fluctuations of link ( plaquette ) variables , while there is no such justification for the expansion in terms of the original link variables the fluctuations of which are not bounded when @xmath71 . as is seen from the generating functional ( [ gffin ] ) it depends only on infrared finite green functions : link green functions are infrared finite by construction , while the green function for the free scalar field is finite in any dimension @xmath72 .    in spite of all these nice properties , it is far from obvious that the expansion is uniformly valid in the volume .",
    "the problem appears in the following way . in @xcite",
    "we compute the first coefficient of the free energy expansion and prove that it coincides with the standard answer .",
    "nevertheless , that computations show clearly that the source of the troubles are the connectors of the nonabelian bianchi identities .",
    "the low - temperature expansion starts from the abelian bianchi identity for every cube and goes towards gradual restoration of the full identity with every order of the expansion .",
    "thus , the generating functional contains an abelianized form of the identity without connectors .",
    "high - order terms include an expansion of connectors which lead to appearence of infrared divergent terms .",
    "consider , for example the term @xmath73 in the exponent of ( [ pfwk ] ) .",
    "@xmath74 includes the following contributions from connectors @xmath75 , where sum over @xmath76 extends over all links belonging to the connector @xmath22 . for any finite @xmath77",
    "one can always find such large @xmath10 that this sum is of the order @xmath78 . in the weak coupling expansion such terms",
    "are treated as perturbations and should be expanded .",
    "these terms are not infrared finite . and even though the final result is infrared finite it is not obvious that such terms may be considered as perturbation in the tl .",
    "indeed , in the infinite volume limit practically all connectors become infinitely long , therefore it is not clear if the last sum is properly bounded in this limit and may be expanded perturbatively .",
    "in this section we give the dual form of @xmath2 lgt which can be obtained from the plaquette formulation .",
    "let @xmath79 be a site dual to the cube of the original lattice and @xmath76 be a link dual to the plaquette of the original lattice .",
    "then it follows from ( [ dualpart ] ) , ( [ func2 ] ) and from the expression for the jacobian that in the case of the @xmath2 gauge group the partition function on the dual lattice can be written in the following form @xmath80 \\prod_l \\xi_l \\ .",
    "\\label{pflsu2}\\ ] ] the summation over @xmath81 corresponds to the summation over all irreducible representations of the @xmath2 group .",
    "the sums over magnetic numbers @xmath82 correspond to the calculation of @xmath2 traces .",
    "the index @xmath30 may run from @xmath83 to @xmath84 depending on the position of the original cube , @xmath77 is the linear extent of the lattice .",
    "the link integral @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a matrix element of @xmath33-th representation .",
    "the integer number @xmath88 depends on the position of the plaquette on the lattice and shows how many times a dual link serves as connector in the bianchi identities .",
    "consider now the t hooft line which in @xmath12 consists of a string @xmath89 of dual links between sites @xmath79 and @xmath90 on the dual lattice .",
    "with the set @xmath91 of plaquettes dual to the string @xmath89 we define the action @xmath92 and the corresponding partition function @xmath93 with action ( [ taction ] ) . here",
    "@xmath94 is center element of @xmath1 . by a change of variables @xmath95 for @xmath96",
    "we get the following representation for the partition function @xmath93 @xmath97",
    "\\ \\prod_{i=1}^3   \\",
    "\\prod_{x(i ) } \\   j\\left ( v_x^{(i ) } \\right )   \\nonumber   \\\\",
    "\\prod_{x(1)\\ne x , y } \\",
    "j\\left ( v_x^{(1 ) } \\right ) \\",
    "j\\left ( zv_x^{(1 ) } \\right ) j\\left ( zv_y^{(1 ) } \\right ) \\ , \\label{sxypf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath94 cancels from all bianchi constraints but those for the endpoints .",
    "therefore , one can say that the bianchi constraint is violated at these endpoints .",
    "it follows from these expressions that in the ensemble defined by the partition function ( [ pflsu2 ] ) the disorder operator becomes particulary simple @xmath98 \\rangle \\ .",
    "\\label{disopdual}\\ ] ] comparing this expression with the partition function ( [ pfwk ] ) and remembering that @xmath81 is just the radial component of the auxiliary field @xmath57 we conclude that introducing sources like @xmath99 amounts to a simple shift in the corresponding sites for the integers @xmath100 in ( [ pfwk ] ) .",
    "therefore , we may interpret the summation over @xmath100 as summation over monopole configurations which appear due to the periodicity of @xmath2 delta - function ( in close analogy with @xmath0 model ) . indeed , expressed in terms of elements of algebra the bianchi identity reads @xmath101 .",
    "configurations @xmath102 we term monopoles of the maximal axial gauge .",
    "investigation of these configurations and their contribution to the wilson loops will be presented in a separate publication .",
