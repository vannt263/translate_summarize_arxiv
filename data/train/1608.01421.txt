    "batygin & brown ( 2016 ) showed that a hypothetical planet ( `` planet nine '' ) in the outer solar system can explain several otherwise intriguing orbital properties of distant kbos .",

    "( 2016 ) and gomes et al .",
    "( 2016 ) suggested that planet nine , which has an inclined orbit relative to the orbital plane of the major planets , may also be responsible for generating the @xmath0 solar obliquity ( the misalignment angle between the sun s rotational equator and the solar system invariant plane ) .",
    "these studies were based on somewhat formal treatments and involved numerical integrations . in this note",
    "we present a pedestrian , but accurate calculation of the solar obliquity generated by planet nine .",
    "this calculation yields a simple and transparent description of how the solar spin orientation depends on the property of planet nine .",
    "batygin & brown ( 2016 ) showed that to explain the spatial clustering of the orbits of distant kbos , planet nine ( labeled `` @xmath1 '' ) must have mass @xmath2 , perihelion distance @xmath3  au , significant eccentricity ( @xmath4 ) and tens of degrees of orbital inclination with respect to the solar system invariant plane .",
    "the angular momentum of planet nine is @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the unit vector ) , with l_p = 0.276l_j(m_p10 m _ ) ( a_p400au)^1/2(1-e_p^2)^1/4 , [ eq : lp]where @xmath7 is the orbital angular momentum of jupiter and we have defined the `` effective '' semi - major axis @xmath8 .",
    "planet nine exerts a torque on each of the `` canonical '' planets ( labeled `` @xmath9 '' , from mercury to neptune ) ; this torque tends to induce a retrograde nodal precession of @xmath10 ( the orbital angular momentum unit vector of planet @xmath9 ) around @xmath6 at the characteristic rate _",

    "however , since the precession frequency due to mutual planet - planet interactions is much larger than the differential @xmath12 , all the canonical planets are strongly coupled , with their angular momentum axes aligned to each other , i.e. , @xmath14 [ see lai & pu ( 2016 ) for a precise calculation of the mutual inclinations induced by an inclined external perturber ] .",
    "the orbital angular momentum unit vector @xmath15 of the canonical solar system planets then evolves according to the equation = _ l _ p ( _ p ) = jl_p_l_p ( ) , [ eq : dl]where @xmath16 is the inclination of planet nine ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is the total angular momentum j = j = l+l_p = l+l_p_p , with @xmath19 ( note that the spin angular momentum of the sun , @xmath20 , is much smaller ) , and & & _",
