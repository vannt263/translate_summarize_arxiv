    "like molecular hydrogen @xmath0 , the much rarer deuterated isotopologue hd has been studied and observed across cosmic time .",
    "a survey of hd/@xmath0  ratios along 41 galactic sightlines has recently been published by @xcite , revising and greatly extending the work of @xcite and yet - earlier results summarized by @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently detected hd in a low - redshift , low - metallicity damped lyman alpha ( dla ) system with column densities n(hd ) and n(@xmath0 ) very much like those seen in the milky way .",
    "hd and @xmath0  have also been detected at eight redshifts toward six dla and sub - dla systems at z @xmath1 1.7 with n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratios well above those seen in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the chemistry of deuterium and hd plays a special role in the formation of structure and the first stars in the early universe @xcite .",
    "although it is generally understood now that observations of hd can not provide a direct determination of the elemental [ d / h ] ratio @xcite , [ d / h ] is well - determined by other means , with [ d / h ] @xmath9 in primordial gas @xcite and [ d / h ] @xmath10 locally @xcite .    given that the intrinsic [ d / h ] ratio is reflected only indirectly in the hd/@xmath0  ratio , the study of hd is now of interest owing to its value as a probe of the microphysics of the diffuse atomic gas and the more general problem of @xmath0-formation in relatively low - density diffuse neutral atomic gas .",
    "the formation rate of hd depends primarily on the local proton ( or deuteron ) density and hence on the strength of penetrating hydrogen - ionizing radiation ( usually the cosmic - ray ionization rate ) . in turn , the proton density is balanced by the processes whereby atomic ions recombine , basically via grain - assisted recombination mediated by the same small particles that heat the gas via the photoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "the interaction of h  and d  with hd and @xmath0  to equilibrate the hd/@xmath0  ratio couples the microphysics and hd chemistry to the general @xmath0  formation problem , highlighting the separate roles of shielding of @xmath0  and hd by themselves and by dust extinction .    here",
    "we discuss these observations of hd in the context of models of the coupled heating / cooling- @xmath0hd- formation in diffuse neutral atomic gas .",
    "section 2 discusses models of @xmath0  and hd formation and self - shielding in diffuse clouds . in section 3",
    "observations of hd in the milky way are discussed and compared with the model results , which are explored in some detail in section 4 in order to separate the various physical and chemical processes involved .",
    "section 5 discusses what is known observationally of the h i-@xmath0  transition in diffuse gas in nearby systems having sub - solar metallicity and section 6 discusses the observations of @xmath0  and hd in high - redshift damped lyman alpha systems ( dla ) .",

    "this work is an update of our earlier investigation of the formation of hd and h@xmath13@xcite , revised to study the wealth of new observations of hd noted in the introduction .",
    "as before @xcite we model the formation of @xmath0  self - consistently in a spherical gas cloud of uniform density immersed in the average ambient , isotropic galactic radiation field , and we compute the local kinetic temperature  following the methods of wolfire and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "the equations of chemical and thermal balance are solved iteratively over a model with 128 or more equi - spaced radial shells , computing the radiation field in each shell averaged over the surrounding 4@xmath14 solid angle .",
    "following the prescription of @xcite ( see also @xcite the rate constant for @xmath0-formation on grain surfaces is taken as 2  @xmath15 but the thermal balance and temperature - dependent rate constant are not of crucial importance to the @xmath0-fraction .",
    "the same results are obtained using a fixed rate constant 2  @xmath16 that is the average of the values obtained toward three stars by @xcite often cited in other work , as discussed in section 5.2 ( those sightlines are called out in figure 5 ) .",
    "the thermal balance is however very important to several endothermic reactions driving the oxygen and deuterium chemistry and to the overall ionization balance in the models .",
    "the models described here differ from our previously published results in that they employ the @xmath0  photodissociation scheme of @xcite which explicitly treats dust attenuation of the radiation field at the wavelengths of the lyman and werner bands of @xmath0  ( 90 - 110 nm ) .",
    "the optical depth for dust absorption is @xmath17 = @xmath18n(h ) @xcite as in @xcite .",
    "regarding our previous models based on the shielding factors of @xcite , we note that incorporation of dust extinction is implicit and somewhat ambiguous in the formulation of @xcite where only an overall @xmath0self - shielding function is employed , more similar to the earlier work of @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the @xcite formulation was recently been verified in great detail by @xcite using an exact calculation in the context of the meudon pdr code .",
    "separation of dust extinction - related phenonema is important for understanding the hd formation problem , and perhaps even more important for understanding the general @xmath0-formation problem in media having low number density and/or low metallicity .",
    "the separate effects of dust extinction , and the shielding factors and dust extinctions for our models are explicitly shown and discussed here .    direct hd formation on grains",
    "is modelled following the precepts of @xcite with a rate constant 40% larger than for @xmath0 .",
    "this is manifest in the models shown in figure 1 at very small n(@xmath0 ) but the direct formation of hd on grains is of almost no relevance to the observations of hd , as noted in section 3 .",
    "self - shielding of hd is important in some cases , and may have contributed to the observed hd ; the self - shielding of hd is the same function of n(hd ) as the self - shielding of @xmath0   employing n(@xmath0 ) .    for reference ,",
    "note that the cosmic - ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen has been taken as @xmath19 as seems appropriate for the diffuse molecular ism @xcite . as a standard value",
    "we take @xmath20 as the free - space photodissociation rate of @xmath0 , as in the work of @xcite from which our @xmath0  self - shielding scheme was drawn",
    ".    other values in the recent literature are @xmath21 ( over 2@xmath14 steradians ) in the work of @xcite and @xmath22 in @xcite . in this work , number and column densities implicitly refer to hydrogen nuclei when stated in the text , unless otherwise noted .",
    "hd does not enjoy the high degree of self - shielding which is the _ sine qua non _ of high @xmath23-fractions .",
    "hence the hd/@xmath0  ratio might be expected to be very small in diffuse gas , well below the inherent [ d / h ] ratio .",
    "that this is not so reflects the fractionation and charge exchange processes determined by the ambient proton and deuteron density as noted by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the basic chemistry of @xmath0-hd interconversion has been sketched out by those authors and by @xcite in the context of early - universe chemistry ; the rates used in this work were taken from table 1 of @xcite . although the fractionation / deuteration chemistry can be quite complex in cold , fully - molecularized dark clouds , it is fairly simple in warmer , lower - density diffuse regions where protons are abundant and only @xmath0  and hd need be considered , with exchange of protons or deuterons as the means of interconversion between the two molecular hydrogen isotopologues .    in a purely atomic gas ionized by cosmic rays",
    "the ionization and recombination rates of h and d atoms would be very nearly the same ( the grain neutralization of d  is slower by a factor @xmath24 owing to the smaller thermal speed of the twice - heavier deuterium isotope ) but a strong and slightly endothermic charge exchange with protons h@xmath25 d @xmath26e",

    "d  @xmath30 hd + h  forms hd with rate constant @xmath31 ps . .",
    "if only charge transfer and @xmath0  fractionation neutralize d   ( a highly reductive assumption ) , a relatively compact expression gives the proton density n(p ) required to reproduce a given hd/@xmath0  ratio in terms of observed quantities and physical constants , with no explicit dependence on either the density or recombination rates : we have    @xmath32 } }    ~ { \\gamma_{\\rm hd } \\over{{\\rm k}_2 } }        [ 1+({{{\\rm k}_2}\\over { { \\rm k}_1}}-2 ) { { { \\rm n}({{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{{\\rm h}_2}}}}})}\\over{\\rm n(h ) } } ]       \\exp { ( { { 41 } \\over t } ) }   \\eqno(1)\\ ] ]    where n(h ) = n(h i ) + 2 n(@xmath23 ) and the photodissociation rate of hd in free space is @xmath33ps .",
    "the required proton density n(p ) derived from eq . 1 is nearly independent of the molecular fraction in the gas for k@xmath34k@xmath35 and there is no explicit dependence on density if the @xmath0  fraction is fixed .",
    "of course the actual proton density may have quite strong dependence on n(h ) and the assumptions used to derive eq .",
    "1 are rather archaic .",
    "below we discuss the actual proton density in the models but the chief means by which an adequate proton density is achieved is the high default cosmic ray ionization rate that we have adopted , see @xcite .",
    "the models whose results are shown here use the cosmic ratio  @xmath9 @xcite which is near the milky way value  @xmath36 determined by @xcite .",
    "the actual gas phase  may be slightly smaller than the overall  value in the milky way but this is a small difference compared to the effects of the chemistry .",
    "moreover the model results are intended to be generally relevant , for instance in figure 1 where the local and high - z results are shown together .",
    "shown in figure 1 are the observational results for n(hd ) and n(@xmath0 ) along the 41 milky way sightlines in the recent omnibus fuse survey of @xcite .",
    "results for the dla sightlines at z @xmath1 1.7 shown in figure 1 are summarized in table 1 and discussed in section 6 .",
    "data for the low - z , low - metallicity dla system at z=0.18 discussed by @xcite are also shown in figure 1 .    in a gas where h and d exist primarily as @xmath0  and hd , n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) @xmath6 2[d / h ] @xmath37 . in the opposite limit when only insignificant amounts of h and d are molecular , n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) @xmath38 [ d / h ] @xcite .",
    "by contrast the galactic hd column densities lie about a factor 10 below the cosmic  ratio in fig .",
    "1 , falling nearly parallel to a line of constant n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) = @xmath39 .",
    "the regression analysis of @xcite found a power - law slope @xmath40 .",
    "the n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) values of @xcite are about three times larger than those considered in our simillar analysis of the same phenomena @xcite .      the slightly super - linear empirical slope determined by @xcite means that n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) increases with increasing molecular fraction 2  = 2n(@xmath0)/n(h ) with n(h ) = n(h i)+2n(@xmath0 ) ( note the annotations in fig . 1 showing 2  along the curves ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the models of @xcite seemed to predict the opposite behaviour except at 2  @xmath41 0.9 and further noted that those models generally underpredicted n(hd ) unless 2  @xmath5 0.1 or 2  @xmath41 0.9 .",
    "this was a straightforward consequence of the gas - phase chemistry of hd that segregated hd in regions of smaller density and lower @xmath0-fraction in diffuse clouds because of its dependence on the presence of a relatively high proton density .",
    "shown in figure 1 are our equilibrium model results for sightlines through the centers of the uniform - density gas spheres discussed in section 2 .",
    "results for a family of models with n(h ) = 16 @xmath12 and varying primary cosmic - ray ionization rate per h - atom @xmath42 are shown with and without the attenuation of lyman and werner band photodissociating radiation by dust .",
    "also shown are model results for n(h ) = 128 @xmath12 .    at the lowest cosmic - ray ionization rate",
    "considered , @xmath43 , the chemistry is essentially switched off and the predicted hd abundance is some three orders of magnitude below observed values .",
    "this demonstrates that when hd is seen in the milky way it overwhelmingly originates _ in situ _ in the gas phase by deuteration of @xmath0 . although the actual [ d / h ] ratio in the gas phase is important , and n(d)/n(h ) in the gas phase is affected by the n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratio @xcite , considerations of hd formation on grains are irrelevant to hd - formation in the observed amounts .",
    "hd molecules formed on grains comprise a negligible fraction of the observed hd .    at the highest cosmic - ray ionization rate",
    "considered , @xmath19 , the observations are bounded by the models with n(h ) = 16 @xmath12 and 128 @xmath12 .",
    "if the cosmic ray ionization rate is ubiquitous , the region occupied by the observations in figure 1 is understood in terms of the relatively slow variations of the n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratio with number density , and clouds with n(h ) @xmath44 128 @xmath12 apparently were not sampled in the observations .",
    "alternatively , if the cosmic ray ionization rate is assumed to vary , it should generally be in the sense of increasing above @xmath45 , implying somewhat higher number density , because neutral atomic gas with number density much below @xmath46 is not generally understood to be thermally stable in multi - phase models of the ism , see e.g. figure 7 of @xcite .    our models with @xmath19 and @xmath47 n(h )",
    "@xmath48 reproduce the observations , including the slightly super - linear slope derived by @xcite , but the slope of the observed variation of n(hd ) with n(@xmath0 ) must also reflect the underlying distribution of physical environments that were sampled . the hd column density results from a variety of influences including the gas - phase chemistry , the individual self - shielding of hd and @xmath0 , their coupling via the chemistry , and the extinction of photodissociating uv radiation by dust .",
    "the consequential difference between our models and those of @xcite lies most nearly in the treatment of the overall ionization balance in the presence of grain - assisted recombination , which both allows and requires a higher cosmic ray ionization rate .",
    "although our models have uniform total number density n(h ) , the molecular fraction , proton density and n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratio vary considerably within them .",
    "figure 2 shows the n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratio and molecular fraction as functions of radius for models with n(h ) = @xmath49 having column densities n(hd ) and n(@xmath0 ) that are typical of the milky way data shown in figure 1 .",
    "the models have 128 radial shells but only barely resolve some sharp variations near the outer cloud edges .",
    "typical variations in n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) are a factor two or three with higher values at the edge and center . at the highest density , n(h ) = @xmath50 , the @xmath0-fraction varies less and generally in the opposite sense from n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) so that hd is distributed rather uniformly throughout the model . at the lowest density , n(hd)/n(@xmath0 )",
    "varies much less than the molecular fraction and the bulk of the hd resides near the center of the model .",
    "two effects directly attributable to dust extinction are shown in figure 2 .",
    "first , the n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratio is slightly smaller in the outer regions of the models when dust attenuation is negelected , presumably because the attenuation by dust has a larger effect on hd than on @xmath0 , given that hd is so much more weakly self - shielded .",
    "second and most noticeably , the n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratio does not rise near the center of models in which the extinction of dissociating photons by dust is neglected ( but note that the scale in the upper panel of figure 2 is much expanded compared to that at bottom ) .",
    "an analogous situation appears in figure 1 for smaller values of  when n(hd ) only rises sharply at n(@xmath0 ) @xmath51 in the presence of dust extinction .",
    "although the @xmath0-fraction always reaches higher values toward the center of models when the explicit attenuation of dissociating photons by dust is included , sharp increases in n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) and n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) result primarily from the onset of strong hd self - shielding , triggered by the extinction due to dust . whether the onset of @xmath0  self - shielding and high @xmath0-fractions is triggered by dust extinction",
    "is the subject of section 4 .",
    "column densities and interior attenuations .",
    "the solid black curves represent the @xmath0  column density toward the geometric centers of models with n(h ) = 8 , 32 and 128 @xmath12 over a wide range of cloud column density n(h ) from front to back of the model , with @xmath52 . as in figure 1 each solid curve",
    "has a dotted red companion representing the same model neglecting dust attenuation .",
    "reading the scale at right , the blue dashed curves separately show the fraction of ambient @xmath0-dissociating photons that penetrates to the centers of the models after @xmath0  self - shielding and dust extinction ( labelled `` total '' ) and the much smaller amount which the dust extinction contributed to that total .",
    "the grey horizontal line represents the attenuation at which the cosmic ray flux indicated becomes the dominant cause of @xmath0  destruction at the rate indicated .",
    ", height=257 ]",
    "in this work , dust extinction of dissociating photons is expressed using a single absorption cross - section @xmath53 as in the work of @xcite and @xcite and scattering is ignored . as shown in the figure 2",
    ", dust extinction raises n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) and 2  near the centers of the models but does not play a large role in triggering the onset of higher n(@xmath0 ) in the outer shielding layers except perhaps at the very lowest density : the curves showing the radial variation of 2  with and without dust extinction differ little in the outer radial regions where 2  abruptly increases by factors of 100 or more .",
    "the reason for this can be better understood in the context of figure 3 showing the attenuation of dissociating photons in models with differing number and @xmath0  column density , along with the particular contribution from dust extinction of dissociating photons .    in figure 3 the onset of higher @xmath0  fractions",
    "is scarcely affected by the presence of dust attenuation , rather , that is determined by the onset of strong @xmath0  self - shielding which already occurs at such small  that there is very little dust opacity even in the uv . if physical conditions foster small @xmath0-fractions at high n(h )",
    ", the dust extinction and its effect on @xmath54  may be appreciable for @xmath0  and this is the situation for hd as well at very high n(h ) in figure 1 .",
    "the details depend on the slopes of the variation of the attenuation with column density : if the self - shielding of @xmath0  varies slowly with n(@xmath0 ) , especially when @xmath54  is larger , dust attenuation and small increases in n(h ) may be efficient at increasing the molecular fraction locally . at the lowest number density in figure 3 , n(@xmath0 ) toward the center of the models about doubles for n(h ) @xmath51 and the strong increases in hd were noted earlier .",
    "whether clouds with such high n(@xmath0 ) exist at such low density is another matter .    also shown in figure 3",
    "is the transmission at which the attenuation of the radiation field is so great that the destruction rate of @xmath0  by cosmic rays equals that due to photodissociation in the lyman and werner bands when @xmath52 .",
    "in fact the destruction of @xmath0  near the centers of our models is dominated by cosmic rays even for clouds having total  = 0.5 - 1 mag ( see also section 5.2 ) .",
    "the high cosmic - ray ionization rates required to explain hd strongly limit the ability of dust extinction to increase 2  inside the outer self - shielding layer .",
    "the overall contribution of dust extinction of lyman and werner band photons is summarized in figure 4 where for models with n(h ) = 8 , 16 , ... , 128 @xmath12 we show the total molecular fraction integrated over the model and the fraction of that total that is directly attributable to dust extinction , calculated symbolically as ( ( mass with dust extinction)-(mass without))/mass(with ) . for conditions approximating a spitzer standard",
    "h i cloud with n(h ) = 32@xmath12 and n(h)@xmath55 some 20% of the hydrogen is in @xmath0  and 30% of that is attributable to the presence of dust extinction .",
    "in figure 5 we show n(@xmath0 ) and n(h ) as determined in uv absorption in the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
    "the galactic data include observations toward bright stars as studied by copernicus @xcite and toward bright stars @xcite and agn @xcite using fuse , extending to much higher n(h ) than were available to copernicus .",
    "the southern hemisphere data is from @xcite .",
    "the milky way data in this plot shows the familiar jump in n(@xmath0 ) at n(h ) @xmath56 whereby the fraction of hydrogen in @xmath0  abruptly increases to @xmath57 .    plotting n(@xmath0 ) against n(h )",
    "is unlike the situation shown in figure 1 , where sightlines have been ordered according to their @xmath0  column densities .",
    "viewing the onset of @xmath0  formation along sightlines harboring a mixture of conditions involves several separate aspects of the ism ; the cold neutral medium of the ism is clumped into diffuse `` clouds '' ( usually called h i clouds by radio astronomers ) ; @xmath0  forms in appreciable quantities in h i clouds having sufficiently high n(h ) ; and lines of sight with n(h ) @xmath58 cross at least one of these clouds .",
    "the column densities at which the jump occurs has been increased , and somewhat spread out by the contribution from unrelated , less - molecular material along the line of sight , see @xcite .",
    "the sightlines used by @xcite to determine 2  are marked in figure 5 ; they all have very high @xmath0-fractions at their respective values of n(h ) : nonetheless the value of the grain surface @xmath0-formation rate constant derived in that work reproduces our temperature - dependent results extremely well as noted in section 5.2 and as shown in figure 6 .    for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ,",
    "the metallicity is some 2.5 times smaller than that of the milky way ( z=0.007 vs. 0.018 @xcite ) and the jump in @xmath0  occurs around n(h ) = @xmath59 , roughly three times that of the milky way .",
    "according to @xcite such n(h ) corresponds to @xmath60 mag , as against  = 0.16 mag in the milky way . for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) with z = 0.002 @xcite ,",
    "the jump in @xmath0  occurs at even higher n(h ) @xmath61 , but corresponding to  = 0.18 mag @xcite , again very similar to the milky way .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + @xmath62 @xcite + @xmath63 @xcite + references ( 1 ) @xcite ; ( 2 ) @xcite ; ( 3 ) @xcite ; ( 4 ) @xcite ; ( 5 ) @xcite +      in section 5.1 we showed that the surface area of large grains ( as represented by  in the small range 0.12 mag @xmath64 mag ) is very nearly constant at the onset of strong self - shielding in @xmath0  in three systems of different metallicity , in principle leading to the question whether it is the extinction by these grains or their aggregate @xmath0-catalytic grain surface area that is responsible for the increase in the @xmath0-fraction with n(h ) .",
    "the behaviour seen in figure 3 suggests that only the grain catalytic area is important , because the dust extinction _ per se _ is small at the onset of @xmath0  self - shielding .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure 6 showing the results of varying several parameters in models with n(h ) @xmath65 .",
    "this is the density of a spitzer h i cloud and for typical ism pressures p / k = @xmath66 k @xcite it is consistent with the kinetic temperatures that have been inferred from the j=1 and j=0 levels of @xmath0 , ie 77 k for the original copernicus survey @xcite , @xmath67k and @xmath68k for fuse sightlines toward distant agn in the galactic disk and halo , respectively @xcite and @xmath69k for the highest column density translucent fuse sightlines toward bright stars @xcite .",
    "the kinetic temperatures in our models are in the range 50 - 160 k , varying inversely with n(h ) and having somewhat higher pressure at higher density , as is generally the case for phase diagrams in multi - phase models of the diffuse ism .",
    "this is all consistent with the heating - cooling model that we adopted and is discussed in greater detail by @xcite .    the curves shown in figure 6 cluster in two groups according to whether the h-@xmath0  transition is shifted appreciably .",
    "some parameters have little effect .",
    "replacing our temperature - dependent @xmath0  formation rate by the value derived by @xcite has little effect . increasing the cosmic - ray ionization rate to @xmath70 increases @xmath0  formation and hastens the onset of @xmath0  self - shielding at small n(h ) because the models are somewhat warmer but @xmath0  formation",
    "is suppressed at the very highest n(h ) because cosmic ray ionization so greatly dominates the @xmath0  destruction .",
    "the column density at the onset of @xmath0  self - shielding scales inversely with the radiation field as expected from the discussion in appendix b but dependence on the radiation field is extremely complex because the thermal and ionization balance is strongly affected .",
    "stronger radiation heats the models , increasing the @xmath0  formation rate , somewhat compensating the increased photodissociation .",
    "also shown in figure 6 are curves corresponding to decreasing the grain surface @xmath0-formation rate constant 2 by a factor of 10 , and separately , a calculation depleting the quantity of large , @xmath0-forming grains by the same amount and perforce also lessening the extinction by dust of dissociating photons by the same amount . figure 6 shows that the onset of @xmath0   self - shielding in the outer shielding layer depends linearly on the grain surface area , but only to the extent that this area is available for catalytic @xmath0  formation ; reducing the grain formation rate and the surface area of large grains both result in self - shielding at very nearly the same n(h ) , confirming that the extinction provided by the grain surface area is a small effect on the initial onset of strong @xmath0  self - shielding and the h i - @xmath0  transition .",
    "the effects directly attributable to the grain surface area differ noticeably inside the self - shielding layer .",
    "when large grains are removed entirely the @xmath0-fraction does not exceed 10% except at very large n(h ) , which is the case in figure 5 for the sightlines with sub - solar metallicity .",
    "inside the self - shielding layer , dust extinction drives the @xmath0-fraction higher , and dust extinction will have a strong effect whenever the @xmath0  fraction is substantially below unity well inside the outer self - shielding layer ; this would be the case at low n(h ) and large n(h ) if those conditions actually occur in the ism .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the time - evolution of the @xmath0  fraction , because regions with lower molecular fraction equilibrate earlier , and , even though dust extinction can increase the equilibrium molecular fraction inside the self - shielding layer , it does not hasten the approach to equilibrium . when dust extinction matters to the @xmath0  fraction the times to reach @xmath0  equilibrium will be long .        ) for models at n(h ) = @xmath71 .",
    "the group of curves at the left includes a `` standard '' model ( solid black ) , a model with the radiation field increased by 40% ( dotted grey ) , a model using the temperature - independent @xmath0-formation rate of @xcite ( dash - dot green ) and a model with @xmath72 ( dashed , blue ) . at",
    "right are models with a diminished grain formation rate coefficient ( dashed red ) and a model in which 90% of the large grains are entirely removed from the calculation ( dash - dot orange ) .",
    "the green dashed line indicates the locus where 10% of the hydrogen is in molecular form .",
    "these models were computed along sightlines displaced 5/6 of the radius from the center , compare with figure 3 to see that the h i - @xmath0  transition has been displaced toward higher n(h ) compared with models observed through the central sightline.,height=269 ]",
    "the observations of hd in dla and sub - dla systems at high redshift are summarized in table 1 and shown in figures 1 and 7 .",
    "although dla and sub - dla systems typically have low metallicity , the systems in which hd has been detected cover a wide range of metallicity from z/@xmath73= 0.04 to 2 .",
    "it is relatively easy to explain the high n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) seen at high z in terms of higher density when the metallicity is small and rather puzzling that the high redshift systems are so similar in having such high hd/@xmath0  ratios while the metallicity varies over such a wide range .",
    "figure 6 shows that a given n(@xmath0 ) will be seen at smaller molecular fractions in systems of lower metallicity because the required n(h ) is larger ; indeed , the dla and sub - dla systems at high redshift have comparable n(hd ) to those seen in the milky way sightlines , but generally at smaller molecular fractions overall . in table 1 systems with high and low metallicity have comparable values of n(@xmath0 ) but with much smaller 2  at the low - metallicity end .",
    "unlike the case at solar metallicity illustrated in figure 1 where n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) decreases with density , larger proton densities and higher hd/@xmath0  ratios are expected at _ higher _ number density when the metallicity is small .",
    "higher proton densities are always more readily available in principle at higher number densities but radiative recombination with electrons from ionized carbon and neutralizations by small grains suppress the proton fraction at higher density when the metallicity is near - solar .",
    "when the metallicity is small , the effects of both electrons and small grains are sharply curtailed and the proton density better tracks the number density overall .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure 7 where we varied the metallicity in our calculations by linearly scaling the abundance of all metals or metal - bearing species ( ie the large and small dust grains ) .",
    "at left it is shown that the n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratio increases at least as fast as 1/z at n(h ) @xmath74 in the range of n(@xmath0 ) where hd is observed at high redshift . at right in figure 7 the increase of n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) with density",
    "is shown for z/@xmath73= 1/16 .",
    "the functional dependence on density is weaker than linear but the senseis quite contrary to the variation with density shown in figure 1 at solar metallicity .",
    "@xcite derived  @xmath75 k from comparison of the j=1 and j=0 levels of @xmath0  toward j0812 + 3208a and observed a ratio log n@xmath76/n@xmath77 = -1.93 in the j=1 and j=0 levels of hd . unlike @xmath0  the j=1 - 0 transition of hd is permitted , with a small dipole moment and a spontaneous transition rate a@xmath78 @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the hd level populations can be used to derive the ambient density and they quote n @xmath79 using a two - level atom approach under the assumption that radiative pumping of the j=1 level is negligible .",
    "they made several errors in their discussion , most importantly using the downward collision rate c@xmath80 in their unnumbered expression for the number density ( their section 3.2 ) when the smaller upward rate is actually called for .",
    "the collisional rate constants for hd excitation by h , he , and @xmath0  are given by @xcite .",
    "they allow a number of important simplifications in the analysis below 100 k , because the rate constants are the same for h and he , and the same for ortho- and para-@xmath0 . as well the rate for @xmath0  excitation is just twice that for atomic hydrogen so that the analysis is independent of the molecular fraction . denoting the upward rate constant for excitation by atomic hydrogen as @xmath81 and the spontaneous emission coefficient as a@xmath80",

    "= 0.085 by number , we find n(h ) = 240 @xmath12 .",
    "such a density is consistent with observed , relatively high hd/@xmath0  at low metallicity ( figure 7 ) and indeed @xcite considered that log z/@xmath73= -1 .",
    "however @xcite actually derived [ o]/[h ] @xmath86 0.36 solar and similar results for [ zn]/[h ] , so that j0812 is _ not _ an especially low - metallicity system .",
    "[ [ hd ] ] hd ~~    in section 3 ( see figure 1 ) we showed that the ratios n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) @xmath87 in the milky way are primarily diagnostic of the cosmic - ray ionization rate and secondarily of the number density in the sense of /n(h ) tending to be constant , with @xmath88 n(h ) @xmath3 for  = @xmath89 .",
    "the gas sampled in galactic hd measurements has moderate density and molecular fraction 2  @xmath90 , because the proton densities necessary to ensure adequate protonation are more difficult to maintain at the higher densities that are more favorable to @xmath0  formation overall ( see figures 2 and 8) .    in section  bf 6 we discussed n(hd ) and n(@xmath0 ) observed in high - redshift dla and sub - dla systems .",
    "dla and sub - dla systems observed at z @xmath1 1.7 have much higher n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratios compared to the milky way , ie with comparable n(hd ) but order of magnitude smaller n(@xmath0 ) and somewhat smaller n(@xmath0)/n(h i ) . in section 5 ( figure 5 )",
    "we discussed how smaller @xmath0  fractions are observed in nearby systems with sub - solar metallicity : @xmath0  becomes self - shielding at progressively larger n(h i ) and smaller @xmath0  fractions , but with nearly - fixed @xmath91 mag when comparing the milky way and magellanic clouds ( figure 5 ) . in section 5",
    "( see figure 6 ) we showed that the onset of @xmath0  self - shielding at progressively higher n(h i ) and fixed  is a consequence of the smaller dust / gas ratio at smaller metallicity , and the consequent smaller grain surface area per unit hydrogen that is available for @xmath0  formation .    in section 6 ( see figure 7 )",
    "we showed that higher n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) and smaller n(@xmath0)/n(h ) can be explained at higher density in systems of smaller metallicity , because the proton density increases with increasing number density , opposite to the milky way case at solar metallicity .",
    "moreover , in one case where the j=1 level of hd is observed in a high - redshift system , the derived number density n(h ) @xmath92 is relatively high .",
    "however this system is not obviously of very low metallicity ( z / z@xmath93 ) and high n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) ratios ranging from 80 - 200% of the cosmic  are observed in high redshift systems over a wide range of metallicity ranging from 0.04 to 2 times solar ( table 1 ) for the 6 out of 8 high z systems with n(@xmath0 ) @xmath94 and smaller quoted column density errors .",
    "conversely , a low - redshift dla system at z = 0.18 has n(hd ) and n(@xmath0 ) values typical of milky way gas and a high @xmath0  fraction , but at metallicity only 7% solar .",
    "it seems odd that the high - redshift systems should share such high n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) values while having so little else in common in terms of the fractionation chemistry expected at their quoted metallicities . for the high - z systems it is tempting to abandon the fractionation scenario , with its implication of a high h - ionization rate , in favor of an ad hoc scenario in which the molecules are in some tight knot where the conversion of both hydrogen and deuterium to molecular form is nearly complete .",
    "but this begs the question of why such similar and unusual conditions would exist over such a wide range of metallicity .      motivated by effects like the sharp central upturns in hd/@xmath0  observed in the upper panel of figure 2 , or as seen in figure 1 at smaller  and high n(@xmath0 ) , we broke out the explicit extinction of @xmath0-dissociating lyman and werner band photons by dust .",
    "as shown in figures 2 and 3 and discussed in sections 3 and 4 , the outer self - shielding layer in @xmath0  is just that , triggered by non - linear effects inherent in the cross - section for @xmath0  photo - absorption ( figure 3 ) with little dependence on the existence of extinction by dust . only at very small n(h ) in a regime that is probably not thermally stable in two - phase ism is the location of the onset of @xmath0-self shielding appreciably shifted by dust extinction .",
    "by contrast , there is a somewhat wider range of number density where dust extinction has an appreciable effect on the @xmath0  fraction inside the outermost @xmath0  self - shielding layer .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , about one - third of the @xmath0  in a cloud at n(h ) = @xmath71 is directly attributable to dust extinction .",
    "the effects of dust extinction on hd are somewhat greater owing to its lesser degree of self - shielding .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , hd/@xmath0  ratios are increased slightly even in the outer portions of our models , with much stronger effects toward the center and even moreso at lower density .",
    "increases in either the amount of @xmath0  or the attenuation of hd - dissociating photons can tip the hd over into a non - linear regime where its local abundance is strongly dependent on its own self - shielding and somewhat less on the local fractionation chemistry .    in discussing the dependence of @xmath0  formation on metallicity , figure 5 shows how the location of the onset of strong @xmath0  self - shielding shifts monotonically to higher n(h ) with decreasing metallicity , in such a way as to keep constant the inferred  representing the total column of grain surface area , see sections 5 and 6 .",
    "this constancy of  could be interpreted as implying that the onset of @xmath0  self - shielding is caused by the extinction due to dust , but that is not the case . as shown in figure 6 , it is the lessening of the grain surface area available for @xmath0  formation that causes the shift , while the dust extinction _ per se _ increases the @xmath0  fraction at yet - higher n(h ) , inside the @xmath0   self - shielding layer .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , producing @xmath0  fractions above 10% requires even much higher n(h ) in low - metallicity systems owing to the diminished dust extinction cross section per h - atom .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is currently operated by associated universities , inc . under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "the hospitality of the itu - r and hotel bel esperance in geneva and the ukatc and the apex city hotel in edinburgh are appreciated during the writing of this manuscript .",
    "evaluating eq 1 we find n(p ) @xmath95 for t = 75 k , using the photodissociation rate of hd @xmath33ps .",
    "in free space @xcite and n(hd)/n(@xmath0 ) @xmath96 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this can be compared with the results shown in figure 8 , where we have plotted the proton and electron densities just inside the outer edge and at the center of the models whose results were depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the electron and proton densities behave very differently with respect to changes in density , largely because carbon remains ionized under all conditions , putting a floor on n(e ) that does not exist for n(p ) . at the outer edge ,",
    "n(e ) increases with density while n(p ) remains nearly fixed owing to a balance between the volume ionization n(h )  and the neutralization by small grains , whose density and neutralization rate change in fixed proportion to n(h ) .",
    "the electron density decreases toward the centers of all the models because the ionization fraction due to ionized hydrogen ( ie , n(p ) ) decreases there .",
    "the proton density decreases by nearly the same factor at all density while the decrease in the electron density at the center is small at high density when ionization of hydrogen is weak .",
    "the decline of n(p ) toward the cloud center means that the chemistry has an innate tendency to segregate protons and @xmath0 , shown in figure 2 , complicating the hd formation problem . in section 3.3",
    "we noted that the distribution of hd is more uniform in radius at higher density , and the models have higher 2  at higher n(h ) but overall it is the proton density that is decisive , and figure 1 shows that lower density clearly wins the hd battle at solar metallicity .    .",
    "the electron and proton densities move oppositely in response to changes in density at solar metallicity , see section 7.,height=396 ]",
    "simply writing down the equation for the growth of @xmath0           shows that @xmath99 , the n(@xmath0)/n(h i ) ratio in free - space , is a dimensionless scaling parameter for this problem .",
    "it serves as the basis of the discussion of @xcite who in terms of our quantities defined @xmath100 = n(h i)/2n(@xmath0 ) = @xmath101 and showed that the data of @xcite ( see figure 6 here ) could be reproduced with @xmath102 corresponding to n(h ) @xmath103 for 2 @xmath104 @xcite and @xmath105 .",
    "the formulation by @xcite does not consider shielding due to dust and indeed , our models showed that dust shielding contributes modestly at that density at solar metallicity ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "the formulation of @xcite is numerically intensive but it provides a description of the width and location of the self - shielding layer without additional assumptions because the equilibrium conditions are solved exactly , although not analytically .    the effects of dust extinction , shown in many instances in our models but most important at small n(h ) , were incorporated in the analytic formulation of sternberg and his collaborators @xcite whose most recent description defines parameters @xmath106 and g that is the mean @xmath0  self - shielding factor including the dust - extinction associated with n(@xmath0 ) ( ie , not n(h ) ) .",
    "the total dust column is considered to have two parts , called the h i and @xmath0  dust , whose columns are proportional to n(h i ) and n(@xmath0 ) . in this formulation the structure of the h i - @xmath0  transition is determined by the product @xmath107 g .",
    "the @xmath107 g @xmath108 and @xmath107 g @xmath109 limits are called the weak- and strong field limits , respectively . the domain where @xmath107 g @xmath110 marks the transition between h i and @xmath0-dominated regimes as indeed seen from the basic definition of @xmath107 or @xmath111 as h i/@xmath0  ratios ; one replaces the small free - space @xmath0/h i ratio by that in the strongly shielded transition zone . in effect , our models lie in the transition between two regimes , as understood in the context of the underlying physics of the heating , cooling and ionization balance .",
    "@xcite explicitly introduced the total attenuation due to dust into the equation of detailed balance ( akin to eqn 1 ) , resulting in the creation of a hybrid ( chimerical ? ) parameter @xmath112 that is in effect a redefinition of @xmath100 . in @xmath112 , the @xmath0  photoabsorption cross section that determines 2",
    "is replaced by the cross - section for dust extinction . because the dust cross section is so much smaller , one deals with @xmath112-values of order unity in the h i - transition region as with sternberg s formulation .",
