    "fomin s _ dual graded graphs _ @xcite , as well as their predecessors - stanley s _ differential posets _",
    "@xcite , were invented as a tool to better understand the robinson - schensted insertion algorithm .",
    "dual graded graphs are significant in the areas where the robinson - schensted correspondence appears , for example in schubert calculus or in the study of representations of towers of algebras @xcite . a recent work of lam and shimozono @xcite associates a dual graded graph to any kac - moody algebra , bringing their study to a new level of generality .      one way to view the theory is as a study of certain _ combinatorial representations _ of the _ first weyl algebra_. let us briefly recall the definitions .",
    "weyl algebra _ , or the first weyl algebra , is an algebra over some field @xmath0 ( usually @xmath2 ) generated by two generators @xmath3 and @xmath4 with a single relation @xmath5 .",
    "it was originally introduced by hermann weyl in his study of quantum mechanics .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , for example , for more background on the weyl algebra .",
    "a _ graded graph _ is a triple @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a discrete set of vertices , @xmath8 is a rank function , and @xmath9 is a multiset of edges / arcs @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "each vertex is assigned a rank , and edges can only join vertices in successive ranks . for the set of vertices @xmath7 , let @xmath12 denote the subset of vertices of rank @xmath13 . for any field @xmath0 of characteristic zero , the formal linear combinations of vertices of @xmath14 form the vector space @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be a pair of graded graphs with a common vertex set and rank function . from this pair ,",
    "define an _ oriented graded graph _ @xmath18 by orienting the edges of @xmath19 in the direction of increasing rank and the edges of @xmath20 in the direction of decreasing rank .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the number of edges of @xmath22 joining @xmath23 and @xmath24 or the multiplicity of edge @xmath10 in @xmath22 .",
    "we define the _ up _ and _ down operators _ @xmath25 associated with graph @xmath14 by @xmath26 and @xmath27    graded graphs @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 with a common vertex set and rank function are said to be _ dual _ if @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an identity operator acting on @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath15 is a representation of the weyl algebra . furthermore , it is a representation of a very special kind , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 act in a particularly nice combinatorial way on a fixed basis .",
    "one would then expect that variations of the weyl algebra would correspond to some variations of the theory of dual graded graphs .",
    "one such variation is the _",
    "@xmath30-weyl algebra _ defined by the relation",
    "@xmath31 the corresponding theory of _ quantum dual graded graphs _ was pursued by lam in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the theory arising from an analogue @xmath32 of the weyl algebra with defining relation @xmath33 we shall refer to it as the ore algebra @xcite , and we shall see that it is a very natural object . in particular , the corresponding theory of _ dual filtered graphs _",
    "fits naturally with the existing body of work on the @xmath0-theory of grassmannians .",
    "[ rem : rescale ] it is easy to see that by rescaling @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we can pass from arbitrary @xmath34 to @xmath1 .",
    "we thus suffer no loss in generality by writing down the relation in the latter form .",
    "the following provides some intuitive explanation for the relation between representations of weyl and ore algebras .",
    "the simplest representation of the weyl algebra is that acting on a polynomial ring .",
    "indeed , consider polynomial ring @xmath35 $ ] , and for @xmath36 let @xmath37 it is an easy exercise to verify that this indeed produces a representation of the weyl algebra .",
    "in fact , this is how it is often defined .",
    "let us now redefine the down operator to be the _ difference operator _ : @xmath38    this gives a representation of the ore algebra @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , those operators satisfy @xmath39 where @xmath29 is the identity map on @xmath40 .",
    "we have @xmath41 @xmath42    it can also be noted that differential and difference operators can be related as follows : @xmath43 we omit the easy proof for brevity .",
    "as we shall see in example [ ex : polys ] , this representation of @xmath32 corresponds to a very basic dual filtered graph .",
    "we make use of two conceptual ways to build examples of dual filtered graphs .",
    "the first construction starts with an algebra @xmath44 , a derivation @xmath4 on @xmath44 , and an element @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",
    "we often build the desired derivation @xmath4 using a _ bialgebra",
    "_ structure on @xmath44 .",
    "this construction is very close to an existing one in the literature @xcite , where dual graded graphs are constructed from graded hopf algebras .",
    "in fact , if we were to require @xmath47 , we would get dual graded graphs instead of dual filtered graphs in our construction .",
    "we refer to this method as the _ pieri construction _ or sometimes as the _ pieri deformation_.    instead , we can also start with an existing dual graded graph @xmath48 ( see definition below ) , composed of graphs @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and adjust @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the following manner . to obtain @xmath53 , we add @xmath54 loops at each vertex @xmath55 to @xmath51 . as for @xmath56 , we create a new edge set @xmath57 by forming @xmath58 edges between vertices @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath59 denotes the mbius function in @xmath60 .",
    "we refer to this construction as the _ mbius construction _ or _ mbius deformation_. note that this does not always produce a pair of dual filtered graphs , and it is mysterious to determine when it does . in some major examples , however , it is the result of this construction that relates to robinson - schensted - like algorithms , for example to _ hecke insertion _ of @xcite .",
    "the following observation seems remarkable , and we call it the _ mbius via pieri phenomenon_. let @xmath44 be a graded hopf algebra , and let bialgebra @xmath61 be its _ @xmath0-theoretic deformation _ in some appropriate sense which we do not know how to formalize",
    ". let @xmath14 be a natural dual graded graph associated with @xmath44 .",
    "what we observe is that applying the mbius construction to @xmath14 yields _ the same result _ as a natural pieri construction applied to @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , the following diagram commutes .",
    "\\(a ) at ( -2,2 ) @xmath44 ; ( tildea ) at ( 2,2 ) @xmath61 ; ( g ) at ( -2,0 ) @xmath14 ; ( tildeg ) at ( 2,0 ) @xmath62 ; ( g ) edge node [ above ] ( tildeg ) ; ( a ) edge node [ left ] @xmath63 ( g ) ; ( tildea ) edge node [ right ] @xmath63 ( tildeg ) ; ( a ) edge node [ above ] ( tildea ) ;    this happens for young s lattice , see section [ ex : g ] , and for the binary tree dual graded graph , see section [ sec : bin ] .",
    "we expect this phenomenon to also occur for the shifted young s lattice .",
    "the crucial condition necessary for this phenomenon to be observed is for @xmath44 to be the associated graded algebra of @xmath61 , but this is not always the case .",
    "for example , this is not the case for @xmath0-theoretic analogues of the poirier - reutenauer and malvenuto - reutenauer hopf algebras , as described in sections [ sec : pr ] , [ sec : mr ] . to put it simply ,",
    "the numbers of basis elements for the filtered components of @xmath44 and @xmath61 are distinct in those cases , thus there is no hope to obtain corresponding graphs one from the other via mbius construction .",
    "interestingly , those are exactly the examples we found where the mbius construction fails to produce a dual filtered graph .      in section [ sec : dgg ] , we recall the definition of dual graded graphs from @xcite as well as three major examples : young s lattice , young - fibonacci lattice , and shifted young s lattice .",
    "we then remind the reader of the definition of the robinson - schensted algorithm and how one can obtain it locally via the machinary of _ growth diagrams _ , also introduced by fomin in @xcite .    in section [ sec : dfg ]",
    ", we formulate our definition of dual filtered graphs .",
    "we then introduce the trivial , pieri and mbius constructions .    in section [ sec : y ]",
    ", we build the pieri and mbius deformations of young s lattice .",
    "we recall the definition of hecke insertion and observe it is a map into a pair of paths in the mbius deformation of young s lattice .",
    "we provide growth rules that realize hecke insertion .",
    "we also show how the pieri construction applied to the ring generated by _ grothendieck polynomials _ yields the same result as the mbius construction applied to young s lattice .",
    "thus we demonstrate an instance of the mbius via pieri phenomenon .    in section [ sec : sy ] ,",
    "we build pieri and mbius deformations of the shifted young s lattice .",
    "we introduce _ shifted hecke insertion _ and remark that its result always coincides with that of @xmath0-theoretic jeu de taquin rectification as defined in @xcite .",
    "we also provide the corresponding growth rules .    in section [ sec : yf ] , we build pieri and mbius deformations of the young - fibonacci lattice .",
    "we define @xmath0-young - fibonacci tableaux and suggest the corresponding insertion algorithm and growth rules .    in section [ sec : other ] , we consider some other examples of dual filtered graphs .",
    "of special interest are the pieri constructions associated to the quasisymmetric functions , to the poirier - reutenauer and malvenuto - reutenauer hopf algebras , as well as to their @xmath0-theoretic analogues , which we draw from @xcite .",
    "the hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions and its @xmath0-theoretic analogue provide another instance of the mbius via pieri phenomenon .",
    "in section [ sec : enum ] , we use the calculus of up and down operators to prove some identities similar to the ones known for dual graded graphs .",
    "in particular , we formulate and prove a @xmath0-theoretic analogue of the frobenius - young identity .",
    "we thank vic reiner , alexander garver , and thomas lam for helpful discussions .",
    "this section follows @xcite , and we refer the reader to this source for further reading on dual graded graphs .",
    "a graded graph is a triple @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a discrete set of vertices , @xmath8 is a rank function , and @xmath9 is a multiset of edges / arcs @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . in other words ,",
