    "the high precision of modern electron scattering experiments imposes severe constraints to nuclear models and theories .",

    "take the generic name of correlations .",
    "the sources of correlations can be generically classified in two categories .",
    "the so called short - range correlations ( src ) are generated by the hard core repulsion of the nucleon - nucleon interaction which prohibits two nucleons to come too close to each other .",
    "the long - range correlations ( lrc ) are produced by collective excitation modes of the nucleus originated by the part of the nuclear hamiltonian neglected by the ipm .",
    "this separation in long- and short - range correlation is an artifact of our approach to nuclear structure usually starting from an ipm basis .",
    "exact solutions of the many - body schrdinger equation , @xcite take automatically into account both kinds of correlations independently from their classification . when approximate or effective theories are used , the role of one or the other kind of correlation can be emphasized .",
    "the results recently obtained with fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) techniques in doubly magic nuclei shows the lack of some correlation effects @xcite , probably lrc .",
    "the aim of this article is to estimate the size of the effects of both kind of correlations on the charge density distributions of some medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "we estimate the lrc within a random phase approximation ( rpa ) approach , and the src effects by using a first order expansion model based on the correlated basis function ( cbf ) theory .",

    "the inclusion of both of them is necessary to describe the charge distribution difference between @xmath0pb and @xmath1tl .",
    "the main message of our work is that , in medium heavy nuclei , the two kind of correlations produce equally important effects beyond the ipm .",

    "the ipm predicts a larger charge difference than the one deduced by the experimental data .    a direct comparison between the differences shown in the lowest panel of figure [ fig : diffa - a1 ] and the experimental one is not correct since the @xmath0pb and @xmath1tl nuclei have a rich open shell structure which is not considered in the @xmath4pb and @xmath68tl system .",
    "to describe the two open shell nuclei we adopted the model already used in reference @xcite .",
    "the ground state of @xmath1tl is described as : @xmath69 where we considered @xmath70=0.86 , @xmath71=-0.47 , @xmath72=0.30 , obtained in reference @xcite using first order perturbation theory with a @xmath73 interaction .",
    "the @xmath74 and @xmath75 states of the @xmath0pb are obtained as linear combination of two - hole wave functions in the closed neutron core of @xmath4pb @xcite .",
    "we use the hole - hole amplitudes calculated in reference @xcite within a tamm  dankoff approximation .",
    "the ground state amplitudes are rather similar to those given in reference @xcite which reproduce the empirical values obtained by an analysis of ( d , p ) reactions on @xmath0pb target .",
    "the ipm charge difference obtained with these wavefunctions is represented by the full lines of figure [ fig : diff205 ] .",
    "while the lrc have been consistently treated within the open shell structure of the two nuclei @xcite , this has not be done for the src . in this case",
    "we supposed their effect to be the same as that calculated in closed shell nuclei : @xmath76\\ ] ] and analogously for the 205207 system . with this hypothesis",
    "the total charge difference between @xmath0pb and @xmath1tl is : @xmath77 where we have indicated with @xmath78 the difference between the charge densities of the two nuclei indicated in the upper index .",

    "the inclusion of both long and short range correlations greatly improves the agreement with the experiment . in the lower panel",

    "we use a first order model in the correlation function .",
    "the correlations have been taken from fhnc calculations done with realistic interaction .",
    "the lrc correlations have been treated within a rpa framework . in this case",
    "we used an effective interaction whose parameters have been fixed to reproduce the @xmath4pb low - energy excitation spectrum .",
    "we have seen that long- and short- range correlations produce similar effects on the charge distributions . in both cases the ipm distributions",
    "are lowered in the center of the nucleus and , as a consequence , the rms radii increase . in terms of s.p .",
    "occupation numbers this effect is produced because both kinds of correlations decrease the occupation of the hole states and increase that of the particle states .",
    "we have shown that in all the nuclei considered the link between s.p . levels and collective low - lying 3@xmath80 state is one of the major sources of modification of the occupation number .",
    "the charge differences with nuclei having one proton less have been calculated in order to compare our results with the measured empirical difference in the pb region . also on the charge difference",
    "the two kind of correlations produce similar results .",
    "also in this case the correlations tend to diminish the difference in the central region . after a proper consideration of the open shell structure of the @xmath0pb and @xmath1tl nuclei ,",
    "the total difference which considers both correlations can reproduce the empirical one .",
    "our calculations do not treat lrc and src on the same ground .",
    "a mixing of ingredients taken from fundamental theory , the correlation functions , and effective theory , the rpa correlations , has been used in our calculations . in all our work the choice of s.p .",
    "wave functions is essential .",
    "the sets of s.p .",
    "states we have used have been taken from the literature and the parameters of the mean field used to generate them have been fixed to reproduce at best the s.p .",
    "energies of the valence states around the fermi level , and the charge distributions . for this reason we did not make a comparison between our charge distributions and the experimental ones .",
    "since the ipm densities are already reproducing rather well the empirical ones , the inclusion of correlations worsen the agreement with the experiment .",
    "it is sufficient a small change in the mean field parameters to obtain a set of s.p .",
    "states which can reproduce the empirical densities after the inclusion of the correlations .",
    "we have done that for @xmath4pb where we have changed the woods - saxon depth @xmath81 from 60.4 mev to 62.0 mev and the radius from 7.46 fm to 7.4 fm .",
    "the results obtained with this new set of s.p .",
    "wave functions are shown in figure [ fig : new208 ] . in the upper panel",
    "we compare @xmath4pb charge densities with the empirical one @xcite . in the lower panel",
    "we show that even with the new set of s.p .",
    "states the charge density difference between @xmath0pb and @xmath1tl is well reproduced .    in the upper panel of figure [ fig : xsect ]",
    "we compare with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite the electron scattering elastic cross sections calculated within the distorted wave born approximation by using the densities of the previous figure .",
    "the dashed - dotted line obtained by including both src and lrc reproduces better the data than the ipm density ( full line ) . in the lower panel we compare our results with the ratio of the elastic cross sections measured on @xmath0pb and @xmath1tl targets @xcite .",
    "also in this case the line better reproducing the data is the dashed - dotted one obtained by including all the correlation effects .",
    "we have presented these results to show that we would be able to describe the empirical densities with small changes of the mean field parameters .",
    "this was not the goal of our work .",
    "we simply wanted to investigate the relative role played by long and short range correlations , and we found that they should be simultaneously considered in order to obtain a successful description of the empirical densities .",
    "this is our main message .",
    "the facts triggering our investigation are related to the difficulties found by recent cbf variational calculations @xcite in reproducing the experimental binding energies and charge distributions of some doubly closed shell nuclei .",
    "these microscopic calculations , depending only from the realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction , provide a good description of the src .",
    "our work adds another piece of evidence that the adequate treatment of the lrc is the missing ingredient .",
    "hopefully , perturbative corrections , like those developed in in references @xcite for nuclear matter , could provide the required description of the lrc .",
