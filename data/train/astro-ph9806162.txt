    "distances of clusters of galaxies are obtained by measuring the redshift of the galaxies inside the clusters . however",
    ", some local mass concentrations could induce peculiar motions superimposed to the hubble flow ( e.g. bahcall & oh 1996 ) .",
    "measurements of these peculiar motions which have important consequences on cosmological models , require the use of independent distance estimates .",
    "one of the methods uses the fundamental plane ( fp hereafter ) of clusters of galaxies ( e.g. schaeffer et al . 1993 , for 16 clusters with a median redshift of 0.04 ) .",
    "adami et al . ( 1998 : a98a hereafter , for 29 clusters with a median redshift of 0.07 ) show in this way a limit for the peculiar cluster motions of less than 1000 km.s@xmath3 .",
    "however , the use of the fp as a distance indicator is not easy : the determination of the total luminosity requires highly accurate photometry and the determination of the core radius requires the positions of the members galaxies . finally , to have a reliable velocity dispersion , more than 10 redshifts ( interlopers removed ) are needed .",
    "it is also common to use the tenth rank galaxy as a standard candle ( e.g. abell , corwin & olowin 1989 : aco hereafter ) to find the distance .",
    "bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) use a sample of cluster velocities based on tully fisher distances of sc galaxies for the same goal .",
    "colless ( 1995 ) , hudson & ebeling ( 1997 ) or lauer & postman ( 1994 ) use also the slope of the brightness profile of the cd galaxies to deduce the distance . using these different methods",
    ", these authors constrain the peculiar velocities of different samples of nearby clusters ( z@xmath90.05 ) .",
    "to re - address these questions , we develop in this work a new distance indicator using the galaxy of the n@xmath0 rank for a given cluster .",
    "we use the enacs ( see katgert et al . 1996 , mazure et al .",

    "1989 ) data . to estimate correctly this indicator , we look at the possible universality of the luminosity function for clusters of galaxies ( lf hereafter ) , after taking into account the correction for parameters such as the number of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "the universality of the lf is for example treated in lumsden et al .",

    "v97 found a significant difference between the rich and the poor clusters , while l97 found a significant difference between the high and low velocity dispersion clusters .",
    "these two studies use the cosmos / edsgc data . for v97 ,",
    "the redshifts of the clusters come from a literature compilation .    in order to study these points and to investigate the existence of a standard candle",
    ", we will proceed as follow : in the first section we describe the selected sample .",
    "we determine in the second section the luminosity function and we look for its universality , at least in the magnitude range [ -21;-17 ] . in the third section ,",
    "we redefine m@xmath1 as a distance indicator and correct it for the influence of background level , the richness of the clusters and the statistical effects and we use it to examine the peculiar motions of the enacs / cosmos clusters of galaxies .",
    "we use in this article h@xmath10=100 km.s@xmath3.mpc@xmath3 and q@xmath10=0 .",
    "in this work , we use the enacs and cosmos surveys .",
    "they are well described in k98 .",
    "enacs gives the redshifts and the r@xmath11 calibrated magnitude and cosmos the positions and the b@xmath12 magnitudes for all galaxies in the clusters .",
    "k98 show that clusters for which the photometry in the two catalogues is based on the same survey plate , the two magnitude scales agree very well",
    ". there do not appear to be serious problems with either magnitude scale .",
    "in addition , some redshifts come from the literature .",
    "the absolute magnitudes have been computed by using the mean cluster redshift and the same k(z)-correction as in l97 : k(z)=4.14z-0.44z@xmath13 .",
    "we have also corrected for galactic extinction using the map of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) in the same way as in a98a .",
    "the redshifts are calculated with respect to the rest frame of the cosmic microwave radiation ( cmr hereafter ) defined by lubin & villela ( 1986).to reduce the substructure effects and to have good measurements of the different cluster parameters such as core radius , velocity dispersion , mean redshift , background level and number of galaxies on the line of sight , we limit the global sample to the 29 most regular clusters in a98a . these clusters have an abell richness greater than 1 .",
    "they do not have major 2d visible substructure .",
    "we take only the unatypical king core radii ( we have removed a3128 which exhibits a large core radius ) . for these final 28 clusters we consider galaxies within 5 king core radii ( about 500 kpc ) .    according to k98 , we know that cosmos has a completeness level of 91% for b@xmath12 @xmath919.5",
    ". however , this estimate refers to areas with high surface density in the cosmos catalogue . for low surface density of galaxies ( outside the clusters ) ,",
    "the completeness level in certainly higher . to increase the completeness ,",
    "we add to the cosmos objects , the enacs ones not found in the given area and inside the clusters . finally , to be sure that we have a complete sample , we limit it to b@xmath12 @xmath919 .",
    "we note also that we remove the objects with a back- or fore - ground redshift ( see katgert et al .",
    "we have finally more than 3500 galaxies in the global sample .",
    "we split the sample into 3 sub - samples to test for spatial variations .",
    "the first sub - sample contains the galaxies between 0 and 2 core radii , the second the galaxies between 2 and 3.5 core radii and the third the galaxies between 3.5 and 5 core radii .",
    "we have almost 1200 galaxies in each of the three sub - samples .",
    "in order to test the universality of the lf for our 28 clusters , we construct from the present data this function . we use a method similar to those used for example in beers @xmath14 tonry ( 1986 ) or merrifield & kent ( 1989 ) for the density profiles reconstruction .",
    "we take into account the different limiting magnitudes of the different clusters .",
    "we consider the composite cumulative lf ( cclf hereafter , noted f(m ) in the figures ) .",
    "l97 use a similar ( colless 1989 ) reconstruction method , while v97 simply add the individual clusters with a common limiting apparent magnitude of 19.4 .",
    "first of all , we remove statistically the background objects in each cluster .",
    "the mean number of removed objects is the mean number of background objects minus the number of already removed objects on the basis of the redshift .",
    "the mean number of background objects comes from a density profile fit , including as a free parameter the background density ( a98a and b ) .",
    "a98a and b have shown that this background estimation is very robust and in good agreement with the count law of field galaxies .",
    "it represents about 44 @xmath8 of the total number of galaxies along the line of sight .",
    "starting from a limiting magnitude of @xmath15=20 , we have rescaled this number for @xmath15=19 ( for better completeness ) by using the count law of l97 in order to calculate the proportion of galaxies in each magnitude bin .",
    "we also use this law to select the magnitude of the background removed objects . to obtain a statistical error ,",
    "we have made 100 calculations of the cumulative lf for each cluster ( clf hereafter ) , taking into account the internal background fluctuation ( i.e. the error in the determination of the mean number of background objects for each cluster ) .    as described above ,",
    "we have applied to construct the cclf an adapted version of the method devised for example by beers and tonry ( 1986 ) for the cluster density profiles .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the corrected absolute magnitude limit of the @xmath17 farthest clusters . up to each @xmath18",
    "we compute the cumulative count @xmath19 of all the galaxies belonging to the set of clusters @xmath20 complete in @xmath21 i.e. verifying @xmath22 ( hereafter these galaxies samples are called @xmath23 ) .",
    "while these cumulative counts @xmath19 are not affected by incompleteness problems , they suffer from sampling errors as @xmath24 increases ( i.e. because the number of selected clusters decreases with distance , the number of galaxies in sample @xmath23 for a given absolute magnitude range is a decreasing function of @xmath24 ) . fig .",
    "1(a ) illustrates this behaviour : the @xmath19 of samples @xmath23 are plotted .",
    "the cut - off @xmath18 are indicated as dotted lines . the number of clusters contributing to a @xmath19 decreases with @xmath18 . in order to minimize sampling errors ,",
    "we adopt the following rescaling procedure for reconstructing the cclf . for",
    "an increasing cut - off @xmath18 , rescaled cumulative counts @xmath25 are defined recursively as follows @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "it consists in replacing up to @xmath18 the cumulative counts @xmath29 by the reconstructed cclf @xmath30 renormalized such that continuity of the final cclf is ensured .",
    "the sampling errors are thus minimized ( @xmath30 are plotted fig .",
    "1(b ) for comparison ) since @xmath30 is estimated using information provided by all the sampled clusters while cumulative count estimate @xmath29 use only the set of @xmath31 clusters verifying @xmath32 .",
    "such a procedure warrants an optimal reconstruction of the cumulative luminosity function of galaxies belonging to a sample of clusters spread in redshifts .",
    "the final cclf is shown in fig.2 , arbitrarily normalized at 1 for m=-19.5 .",
    "it spans a range of 4 absolute magnitudes m between -21 and -17 .",
    "the lower limit allows us to exclude the very bright galaxies ( cd galaxies ) which are probably not belonging to the mean luminosity function .",
    "the upper limit corresponds to the absolute magnitude of the faintest galaxy with m@xmath33=19 in the nearest cluster .",
    "l97 have used the range [ -21;-18 ] and v97 the ranges [ -21.5;-17 ] and [ -21.5;-16 ] .",
    "this method assumes obviously that the lf s are similar in the different clusters .",
    "we will check afterwards that this condition is well satisfied ( see sec .",
    "3.2.3 ) .",
    "we looked for spatial variations of the lf . in order to do that , we tested the cclf in the 3 defined areas .",
    "we reconstructed it exactly in the same way as above but for zones enclosed in [ 0,2 ] r@xmath34 ( cclf1 ) , [ 2,3.5 ] r@xmath34 ( cclf2 ) and [ 3.5,5]r@xmath34 ( cclf3 ) .",
    "we superpose the three cclf s ( fig .",
    "3 ) after normalization at 1 for m=-19.5 .",
    "they look very similar . a kolmogorov - smirnov show that cclf1 and cclf2 are identical at a confidence level of 95 % .",
    "cclf2 and cclf3 are identical at a confidence level of only 65% .",
    "the conclusion is that the 3 cclf s are probably identical ( with a high confidence level ) and that the lf s do not vary significantly with the radius .",
    "this result is in agreement with v97 , which have used 55 clusters ( 16 rich clusters ) .",
    "only 3 of those clusters are common with our sample .",
    "they did not find significant variations of the lf within 1 mpc from the center ( roughly 10 core radii ) .",
    "moreover , this universality supports our background subtraction approach .",
    "we assumed implicitely that the background is homogeneous inside 5 core radii .",
    "the number of removed galaxies in each of the three bins is then directly proportional to the area of these bins .",
    "we have thus removed 4 times more galaxies in the exterior bin than in the central one . however , the three reconstructed cclf s are very similar , supporting the way we remove the background .",
    "a way to test this point is to compare the individual clusters clf to the cclf ( fig .",
    "we plot all the individual clf s in apparent magnitudes and no subtracted background ( g(m ) in fig .",
    "we simulate the theoretical no background subtracted clf s by adding background objects ( l97 ) to the reconstructed mean cclf ( normalized to the number of galaxies in each cluster ) .",
    "we see a good agreement between the observations and the simulations .",
    "we can quantify this agreement by using a kolmogorov - smirnov test between the observed data and the simulated data .",
    "we test the hypothesis that the observations and simulations are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the mean risk is 62% for 80% of the clusters which is a conclusive statement : we have a small dispersion of the individual clf s around the mean function , and so the lf is probably universal .",
    "if the individual clf s are drawn from a universal function , the differences ( and so the risks ) must be randomly distributed . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we generate 500 random distributions of 28 clf s ( normalized like each real cluster ) around the reconstructed global cclf .",
    "we proceed with another kolmogorov smirnov test and we find a level of 75% to reject the right hypothesis if we assume that the individual risks distribution is non random . as a conclusion , we can say that the cclf s are globally universal for all our 28 selected rich clusters .",
    "this is in agreement with l97 or trentham ( 1998 ) .",
    "we note that v97 argue against a universal lf , but between the rich and the poor clusters .",
    "even if the following sections do not use this modelisation , we fit here a schechter function ( 1976 ) to the lf :    @xmath35\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is given by the number of galaxies in each cluster and @xmath37 is the characteristic magnitude .",
    "we use the minimization algorithm minuit ( e.g. a98a ) .",
    "first , we calculate a @xmath38 fit using the weights of the reconstruction .",
    "we have @xmath39=-1.50 @xmath5 0.11 and m@xmath6=-19.91 @xmath5 0.21 .",
    "the lf s calculated with the 3 radial zones give similar results at the 1 sigma level .",
    "if we minimize the maximal distance ( divided by weight ) between the model and the observations instead of the @xmath38 ( kolmogorov smirnov fit : kms fit hereafter ) , we have @xmath39=-1.47 and m@xmath6=-19.89 ( without reliable errors ) .",
    "these two results are consistent at the 1 sigma level ( according to the error bars ) .",
    "morever , we have a difference of less than 2 @xmath8 for @xmath39 and 1 @xmath8 for m@xmath6 .",
    "the parameter determination is then independent of the fitting method .",
    "these values could also be compared with the recent analyses of l97 and v97 .",
    "they have both used the @xmath40 minimization .",
    "v97 have found @xmath39=-1.5@xmath410.1 and m@xmath6=-20.0@xmath410.1 for their rich clusters and for the magnitude range [ -21.5;-17 ] .",
    "those two parameters are in agreement at the 1 sigma level with our kms or @xmath40 determinations",
    ".    l97 find @xmath39=-1.22@xmath410.04 and m@xmath6=-20.16@xmath410.02 in the magnitude range [ -21,-18 ] .",
    "the result for m@xmath42 is also in good agreement with our value at the 1 sigma level .",
    "however , the @xmath4 value is only consistent at the 3 sigma level .",
    "if we fit into the same magnitude range we find m@xmath6=-20.18@xmath410.20 in perfect agreement with l97 , but @xmath39=-1.63@xmath410.12 consistent at only 3 sigma .",
    "we note that l97 use q@xmath10=1 , but it has no influence on the m@xmath43 determination .    for individual clusters ,",
    "we compare with bernstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and lobo et al .",
    "they found respectively @xmath39=-1.42@xmath410.05 and @xmath44=-1.59@xmath410.02 for the coma cluster .",
    "the two values are consistent with our kms fit at the 1 sigma level .",
    "we note here that these two values are deduced from photometric surveys of the core of the coma cluster after statistical background subtraction . for the lobo et al .",
    "study , we have considered the result for a schechter profile fit only .    nearly all the results cited in the literature are consistent with our parameters .",
    "the only discrepancy occurs for the @xmath4 value of l97 .",
    "this could be due to two major sources :    -first , bernstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , l97 , v97 or lobo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) remove the background galaxies in a statistical way .",
    "the most local corrections are made in l97 and consist in the removal of a uniform background density calculated in an external annulus .",
    "but , the radius of this annulus is always greater than 4 mpc .",
    "we show in a98a that the background density may change by a significant factor at these scales . as an example",
    ", the two clusters a3825 and a3827 are separated only by about 3 mpc and the background density for a3825 is 40 @xmath8 higher than for a3827 . removing the background by using a distant external annulus could then induce a bias .",
    "-second , l97 use all the cosmos galaxies brighter than b@xmath12=20 . we know",
    "( see k98 ) that the cosmos catalogue in the area of enacs clusters is only complete at the 90 @xmath8 level for b@xmath12@xmath4519.5 and we limit here our sample to b@xmath12@xmath4519 to be sure to be complete .",
    "the lf s of l97 could then miss some galaxies in the faint parts , which could lead to a lower @xmath4 value .",
    "after we have shown that lf s are universal within the considered magnitude range , we want to test the hubble flow and to try to determine the peculiar velocities in our sample of clusters of galaxies by using a distance indicator using photometric data .",
    "following jones & mazure ( 1993 ) , who have used @xmath46 ( where m@xmath47 is the magnitude of the r@xmath0 ranked cluster galaxy ) , we search for a similar standard candle .",
    "we test here m@xmath1 with n@xmath48[1,28 ] .",
    "we first look at the hubble relation for the m@xmath49 magnitude to be coherent with aco ( 1989 ) . by using bisector indicators ( isobe et al . ,",
    "1990 ) , we find a regression slope between m@xmath49 and log10(cz ) of 4.58@xmath411.24 consistent with the previous aco results .",
    "this is in good agreement with the expected value of 5 .",
    "so , we will fix hereafter the slope of all the regressions between m@xmath1 and log10(cz ) to a value of 5 .",
    "we want now to find the optimal rank to define a distance indicator . to deal with the real minimal observing conditions , we use all the projected galaxies : we do not remove from the total sample the fitted number of background galaxies .",
    "we compute the basic dispersion of the relations between m@xmath1 and log10(cz ) for each n. the best choice is the rank n for which the dispersion is minimal .",
    "we see on fig .",
    "5 that the basic dispersion is minimal for the first ranks .",
    "if we take for example n=5 ( see tab .  1",
    ") , the dispersion is 0.61 magnitude . if we assume as the mean velocity of our cluster sample 20000 km.s@xmath3 , the corresponding dispersion in velocity is 5612 km.s@xmath3 ( 0.02 in redshift ) .",
    "we have m@xmath50=5log(cz)-(4.46@xmath50.12 ) .    clearly , this precision is too low to allow any analysis of the peculiar velocities of the individual clusters .",
    "the indicator used previously is affected by different intrinsic factors peculiar to each cluster , such as the background level , the richness of the clusters ( number of galaxies inside these clusters ) and of course the peculiar velocities .",
    "we want here to correct for the background and for the richness .",
    "to model these two contributions , we assume first that in our absolute magnitude range [ -21.,-17 . ] , the count law of the background galaxies g@xmath51(m ) is proportional to the canonical exponential : exp(@xmath4(m - m@xmath33 ) ) with @xmath4 the logarithmic slope and m@xmath33 the apparent limiting magnitude ( = 19 . ) .",
    "second , we note f@xmath10(m ) ( with m the absolute magnitude ) the clf normalized to unity at m@xmath10=-19.5 .",
    "if @xmath52 is the distance modulus of a given cluster , we have m = m-@xmath52 .",
    "we deduce then an expression for the rank k of a galaxy in a given cluster with n@xmath34 member galaxies and n@xmath51 background galaxies ( according to the apparent limiting magnitude m@xmath33=19 ) :    k = n@xmath34f@xmath10(m@xmath53)+n@xmath51g@xmath51(m@xmath53)=n@xmath34f@xmath10(m@xmath53-@xmath52)+n@xmath51g@xmath51(m@xmath53 )    we derive then the corrected value of the k@xmath0 magnitude :    m@xmath53-@xmath52=f@xmath10@xmath3((1/n@xmath34)(k - n@xmath51g@xmath51(m@xmath53 ) ) )    where n@xmath51 is deduced from the fits of the different density profiles ( see a98a ) and n@xmath34 is the observed individual number of cluster galaxies with m@xmath45m@xmath10 .",
    "we see in fig .  5 the improvement resulting from the corrections .",
    "we note that the dispersion does not decrease after the 20@xmath0 rank because we start to deal with clusters with less than 20 galaxies in the studied areas .",
    "we note also that a correction for background galaxies using mean densities instead of our local estimation is not very efficient .",
    "the final dispersion of 0.254 leads to a precision in velocity of about 2300 km.s@xmath3 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 the relation between the corrected distance modulus @xmath52=m@xmath54-m@xmath54 of each of the 28 clusters and 5log(cz ) ( see also tab .  1 ) .",
    "m@xmath54 is the measured apparent 15@xmath0 magnitude and m@xmath54 is the absolute magnitude corrected for richness and background effects .",
    "removing a0087 from the sample ( the atypical cluster in fig .",
    "6 ) , we obtain a dispersion of 0.210 magnitude ( 1900 km.s@xmath3 ) .",
    "durret et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that a0087 is not really a cluster , but the result of a superposition effect .",
    "a part of the dispersion is due to statistical fluctuations originating from finite sample size effects when we reconstruct the cclf ( see @xmath55 3.1 ) .",
    "we have quantified this effect by carrying out 1000 monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we estimate then the probability p(@xmath56 ) to have a statistical contribution lower than a given value @xmath57 . according to the observed value of the magnitude dispersion @xmath58 and assuming that all the remaining dispersion ( corrected for richness , background and statistical effects ) is due to peculiar motions",
    ", we can deduce the probability to have an error if we assume that the remaining dispersion is lower than ( @xmath59-@xmath60)@xmath61 .",

    "we compute these equivalent upper peculiar motions by adopting a mean velocity of 20000 km.s@xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "if we consider for example a risk of 45 @xmath8 for p(@xmath56 ) , we give a dispersion of 0.11 magnitude equivalent to peculiar motions within an amplitude of 1000 km.s@xmath3 ( 0.09 magnitude or 800 km.s@xmath3 without a0087 ) . with a conservative risk of 10@xmath8 ,",
    "we predict a dispersion of 0.17 magnitude equivalent to peculiar motions less than 1500 km.s@xmath3 ( 0.13 magnitude or 1200 km.s@xmath3 without a0087 ) .",
    ".parameters for the 28 used clusters .",

    "we deduce that this maximal dispersion is somewhat larger than the value of bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) .",
    "they found a risk inferior to 5% to have clusters of galaxies with a random peculiar velocity greater than 600 km.s@xmath3 .",
    "however , their studied clusters ( and groups ) have a recession velocity less than 10000 km.s@xmath3 and the equivalent magnitude dispersion is similar to our result .",
    "several other studies have analyzed the proper motions of the nearby clusters in the cmb frame : lauer & postman ( 1994 ) , colless ( 1995 ) or more recently hudson & ebeling ( 1997 ) .",
    "they use the slope of the brightness profiles of cd galaxies as distance indicator .",
    "the lauer & postman ( respectively colless and hudson & ebeling ) distance indicator precision is 0.24 magnitude ( respectively 0.24 and 0.41 magnitude ) .",
    "this is similar to our precision .",

    "( 1997 ) . they have used a sub - sample of 28 distant type ia supernovae to constrain the cosmological parameters , and they obtain a dispersion of 0.19 magnitude , very consistent with our value .",
    "finally , we have similar values ( slightly greater ) for the peculiar velocities than in a98a with almost the same sample .",
    "we have readressed the question of the determination of a distance indicator by using as standard candle the n@xmath0 ranked galaxy .    in order to correct the magnitudes for different factors",
    ", we have addressed the question of the universality of the luminosity function for rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "we have constructed a cclf by using 28 rich clusters in the magnitude range [ -21;-17 ] .",
    "the fit of a schechter model gives @xmath4=-1.50@xmath50.11 and m@xmath6=-19.91@xmath50.21 in good agreement with other literature results .",
    "this function is found to be universal for these clusters , consistent with the l97 study .",
    "we have found that the uncorrected distance indicator m@xmath1 is more efficient for the first ranks n. with n=5 , we observe a dispersion of about 0.6 magnitude , too large however to derive correct peculiar velocities .",
    "we then use the cclf to model the effect of the cluster richness on m@xmath1 in order to have a better precision and to better constrain the cluster peculiar velocities .",
