    "bayesian methods are increasingly used in recent years in the theory and practice of statistics .",
    "their implementation requires specification of both a likelihood and a prior . with enough historical data ,",
    "it is possible to elicit a prior distribution fairly accurately .",
    "however , even in its absence , bayesian methods , if judiciously used , can produce meaningful inferences based on the so - called `` objective '' or `` default '' priors .",
    "the main focus of this article is to introduce certain objective priors which could be potentially useful even for frequentist inference .",
    "one such example where frequentists are yet to reach a consensus about an `` optimal '' approach is the construction of confidence intervals for the ratio of two normal means , the celebrated fieller  creasy problem .",
    "it is shown in section [ s4 ] of this paper how an `` objective '' prior produces a credible interval in this case which meets the target coverage probability of a frequentist confidence interval even for small or moderate sample sizes .",
    "another situation , which has often become a real challenge for frequentists , is to find a suitable method for elimination of nuisance parameters when the dimension of the parameter grows in direct proportion to the sample size .",
    "this is what is usually referred to as the neyman ",
    "scott phenomenon .",
    "we will illustrate in section [ s3 ] with an example of how an objective prior can sometimes overcome this problem .    before getting into the main theme of this paper ,",
    "we recount briefly the early history of objective priors .",
    "one of the earliest uses is usually attributed to bayes ( @xcite ) and laplace ( @xcite ) who recommended using a uniform prior for the binomial proportion @xmath0 in the absence of any other information . while intuitively quite appealing , this prior has often been criticized due to its lack of invariance under one - to - one reparameterization .",
    "for example , a uniform prior for @xmath0 in the binomial case does not result in a uniform prior for @xmath1 .",
    "a  more compelling example is that a uniform prior for @xmath2 , the population standard deviation , does not result in a uniform prior for @xmath3 , and the converse is also true . in a situation like this , it is not at all clear whether there can be any preference to assign a uniform prior to either @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , jeffreys ( @xcite ) general rule prior , namely , the positive square root of the determinant of the fisher information matrix , is invariant under one - to - one reparameterization of parameters .",
    "wewill motivate this prior from several asymptotic considerations . in particular , for regular models where asymptotic normality holds , jeffreys prior enjoys many optimality properties in the absence of nuisance parameters . in the presence of nuisance parameters ,",
    "this prior suffers from many problems ",
    "marginalization paradox , the neyman ",
    "scott problem , just to name a few .",
    "indeed , for the location  scale models , jeffreys himself recommended alternate priors .",
    "there are several criteria for the construction of objective priors .",
    "the present article primarily reviews two of these criteria in some detail , namely , `` divergence priors '' and `` probability matching priors , '' and finds optimal priors under these criteria .",
    "the class of divergence priors includes `` reference priors '' introduced by bernardo ( @xcite ) .",
    "the `` probablity matching priors '' were introduced by welch and peers ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are many generalizations of the same in the past two decades .",
    "the development of both these priors rely on asymptotic considerations .",
    "somewhat more briefly , i  have discussed also a few other priors including the `` right '' and `` left '' haar priors .    the paper does not claim the extensive thorough and comprehensive review of kass and wasserman ( @xcite ) , nor does it aspire to the somewhat narrowly focused , but a very comprehensive review of probability matching priors as given in ghosh and mukerjee ( @xcite ) , datta and mukerjee ( @xcite ) and datta and sweeting ( @xcite ) .",
    "a very comprehensive review of reference priors is now available in bernardo ( @xcite ) , and a unified approach is given in the recent article of berger , bernardo and sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "while primarily a review , the present article has been able to unify as well as generalize some of the previously considered criteria , for example , viewing the reference priors as members of a bigger class of divergence priors .",
    "interestingly , with some of these criteria as presented here , it is possible to construct some alternatives to jeffreys prior even in the absence of nuisance parameters .",
    "the outline of the remaining sections is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we introduce two basic tools to be used repeatedly in the subsequent sections .",
    "one such tool involving asymptotic expansion of the posterior density is due to johnson ( @xcite ) , and ghosh , sinha and joshi ( @xcite ) , and is discussed quite extensively in ghosh , delampady and samanta ( @xcite ) and datta and mukerjee ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second tool involves a shrinkage argument suggested by dawid and used extensively by j.  k. ghosh and his co - authors .",
    "it is shown in section  [ s3 ] that this shrinkage argument can also be used in deriving priors with the criterion of maximizing the distance between the prior and the posterior .",
    "the distance measure used includes , but is not limited to , the kullback ",
    "leibler ( k  l ) distance considered in bernardo ( @xcite ) for constructing two - group `` reference priors . ''",
    "also , in this section we have considered a new prior different from jeffreys even in the one - parameter case which is also invariant under one - to - one reparameterization .",
    "section [ s4 ] addresses construction of priors under probability matching criteria .",
    "certain other priors are introduced in section [ s5 ] , and it is pointed out that some of these priors can often provide exact and not just asymptotic matching .",
    "some final remarks are made in section  [ s6 ] .    throughout this paper",
    "the results are presented more or less in a heuristic fashion , that is , without paying much attention to the regularity conditions needed to justify these results .",
    "more emphasis is placed on the application of these results in the construction of objective priors .",
    "an asymptotic expansion of the posterior density began with johnson ( @xcite ) , followed up later by ghosh , sinha and joshi ( @xcite ) , and many others .",
    "the result goes beyond that of the theorem of bernstein and von mises which provides asymptotic normality of the posterior density .",
    "typically , such an expansion is centered around the mle ( and occasionally the posterior mode ) , and requires only derivatives of the log - likelihood with respect to the parameters , and evaluated at their mle s .",
    "these expansions are available even for heavy - tailed densities such as cauchy because finiteness of moments of the distribution is not needed .",
    "the result goes a long way in finding asymptotic expansion for the posterior moments of parameters of interest as well as in finding asymptotic posterior predictive distributions .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the posterior resembles that of an edgeworth expansion , but , unlike the latter , this approach does not need use of cumulants of the distribution .",
    "finding cumulants , though conceptually easy , can become quite formidable , especially in the presence of multiple parameters , demanding evaluation of mixed cumulants .",
    "we have used this expansion as a first step in the derivation of objective priors under different criteria . together with the shrinkage argument as mentioned earlier in the , and to be discussed later in this section",
    ", one can easily unify and extend many of the known results on prior selection .",
    "in particular , we will see later in this section how some of the reference priors of bernardo ( @xcite ) can be found via application of these two tools .",
    "the approach also leads to a somewhat surprising result involving asymptotic expansion of the distribution function of the mle in a fairly general setup , and is not restricted to any particular family of distributions , for example , the exponential family , or the location ",
    "scale family .",
    "a detailed exposition is available in datta and mukerjee ( @xcite , pages 58 ) .    for simplicity of exposition",
    ", we consider primarily the one - parameter case .",
    "results needed for the multiparameter case will occasionally be mentioned , and , in most cases , these are straightforward , albeit often cumbersome , extensions of one - parameter results . moreover , as stated in the , the results will be given without full rigor , that is , without any specific mention of the needed regularity conditions .",
    "we begin with @xmath4 i.i.d . with common p.d.f .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the mle of @xmath7 .",
    "the likelihood function is denoted by @xmath8 and let @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10_{\\theta= \\hat{\\theta}_{n}}$ ] , @xmath11 and let @xmath12 , the observed per unit fisher information number .",
    "consider a twice differentiable prior @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 , and let @xmath15 denote the posterior p.d.f . of @xmath16 given@xmath17 .",
    "then , under certain regularity conditions , we have the following result .    [ teo1 ]",

    "the statement involves a few minor typos which can be corrected easily .",
    "we outline here only a few key steps needed in the proof .",
    "we begin with the posterior p.d.f . , @xmath22\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad\\quad= \\exp[\\ell_{n } ( \\theta ) ] \\pi(\\theta ) \\bigl/ \\int\\exp[\\ell_{n } ( \\theta ) ] \\pi(\\theta)\\,d \\theta.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting @xmath23 , the posterior p.d.f .",

    "the interesting point is that one never needs explicit specification of @xmath46 in carrying out this evaluation .",
    "we will see several illustrations of this in this article .",
    "first , we present the shrinkage argument in a nutshell . consider a proper prior @xmath47 with a compact rectangle as its support in the parameter space , and @xmath48 vanishes on the boundary of support , while remaining positive in the interior .",

    "first , although the bayesian approach to frequentist asymptotics requires edgeworth type assumptions , it avoids an explicit edgeworth expansion involving calculation of approximate cumulants .",
    "second , as we will see , it helps establish the results in an easily interpretable compact form .",
    "the following two sections will demonstrate multiple usage of these two basic tools .",

    "some optimality properties of left - haar priors are given in datta and ghosh ( @xcite ) .",
    "in example [ ex1 ] , for the location  scale family of distributions , the right - haar prior is bernardo s reference prior when either @xmath113 or @xmath2 is the parameter of interest , while the other parameter is the nuisance parameter .",
    "also , it is shown in datta , ghosh and mukerjee ( @xcite ) that for the location ",

    ", we demonstrate this only for the normal example .",

    "similarly , a left invariant haar density on @xmath426 which we will denote by @xmath430 must satisfy @xmath431 , where @xmath432 .",
    "an alternate representation of the right- and left - haar densities are given by @xmath433 and @xmath434 , respectively .",
    "it is shown in halmos ( @xcite ) and nachbin ( @xcite ) that the right- and left - invariant haar densities exist and are unique up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "berger ( @xcite ) provides calculation of @xmath427 and @xmath430 in a  very general framework .",
    "he points out that if @xmath426 is isomorphic to the parameter space @xmath435 , then one can construct right- and left - invariant haar priors on the parameter space @xmath435",
    ". a very substantial account of invariant haar densities is available in datta and ghosh ( @xcite ) .",
    "severini , mukerjee and ghosh ( @xcite ) have demonstrated the exact matching property of right invariant haar densities in a prediction context under fairly general conditions .      here we discuss a new matching criterion which we will refer to as the `` moment matching criterion . '' for a regular family of distributions , the classic article of bernstein and von mises ( see , e.g. , ferguson , @xcite , page 141 ; ghosh , delampady and samanta , @xcite , page  104 ) proved the asymptotic normality of the posterior of a parameter vector centered around the maximum likelihood estimator or the posterior mode and variance equal to the inverse of the observed fisher information matrix evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimator or the posterior mode .",
    "we utilize the same asymptotic expansion to find priors which can provide high order matching of the moments of the posterior mean and the maximum likelihood estimator . for simplicity of exposition",
    ", we shall primarily confine ourselves to priors which achieve the matching of the first moment , although it is easy to see how higher order moment matching is equally possible .",
    "the motivation for moment matching priors stems from several considerations .",
    "first , these priors lead to posterior means which share the asymptotic optimality of the mle s up to a high order .",
    "in particular , if one is interested in asymptotic bias or mse reduction of the mle s through some adjustment , the same adjustment applies directly to the posterior means . in this way , it is possible to achieve bayes - frequentist synthesis of point estimates .",
    "the second important aspect of these priors is that they provide new viable alternatives to jeffreys prior even for real - valued parameters in the absence of nuisance parameters motivated from the proposed criterion .",
    "a third motivation , which will be made clear later in this section , is that with moment matching priors , it is possible to construct credible regions for parameters of interest based only on the posterior mean and the posterior variance , which match the maximum likelihood based confidence intervals to a  high order of approximation .",
    "we will confine ourselves primarily to regular families of distributions .",
    "let @xmath436 be independent and identically distributed with common density function@xmath437 , where @xmath438 , some interval in the real line .",
    "consider a general class of priors @xmath439 for @xmath7 . throughout",
    ", it is assumed that both @xmath112 and @xmath13 satisfy all the needed regularity conditions as given in johnson ( @xcite ) and bickel and ghosh ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath7 . under the prior @xmath13 ,",
    "we denote the posterior mean of @xmath7 by @xmath440 .",
    "the formal asymptotic expansion given in section [ s2 ] now leads to @xmath441 , where @xmath442 and @xmath70 are defined in theorem  [ teo1 ] .",
    "the law of large numbers and consistency of the mle now give @xmath443 . with the choice",
    "@xmath444 $ ] , one gets @xmath445 .",
    "we will denote this prior as @xmath446 .",
    "ghosh and liu ( @xcite ) have shown that if @xmath221 is a one - to - one function of @xmath7 , then the moment matching prior @xmath447 for @xmath448 is given by @xmath449 .",
    "we now see an application of this result .",
    "consider the regular one - parameter exponential family of densities given by @xmath450 $ ] .",
    "for the canonical parameter @xmath7 , noting that @xmath451 and @xmath452 @xmath453=\\break i^{1/2}(\\theta)$ ] , which is jeffreys prior .",
    "on the other hand , for the population mean @xmath454 which is a strictly increasing function of @xmath7 [ since @xmath455 $ ] , the moment matching prior @xmath456 .",
    "in particular , for the binomial proportion @xmath0 , one gets the haldane prior @xmath457 , which is the same as hartigan s ( @xcite ) maximum likelihood prior .",
    "however , for the canonical parameter @xmath458 , whereas we get jeffreys prior , hartigan ( @xcite ) gets the laplace @xmath459 prior .",
    "it is now clear that a fundamental difference between priors obtained by matching probabilities and those obtained by matching moments is the lack of invariance of the latter under one - to - one reparameterization",
    ". it may be interesting to find conditions under which a moment matching prior agrees with jeffreys prior @xmath235 or the uniform constant prior .",
    "the former holds if and only if @xmath460 , while the latter holds if and only if @xmath461 .    the if part of the above results are immediate from the definition of @xmath446 . to prove the only if parts , note that if @xmath462 , first taking logarithms , and then differentiating with respect to  @xmath7 , one gets @xmath463 so that @xmath460 . on the other hand , if @xmath464 , then taking logarithms , and then differentiating with respect to @xmath7 , one gets@xmath461 .",
    "the above approach can be extended to the matching of higher moments as well . noting that @xmath465-(\\hat{\\theta}_n^b -\\hat{\\theta}_n)^2",
    "$ ] , it follows immediately that under the moment matching prior @xmath466 , @xmath467 .",
    "this fact helps construction of credible intervals for  @xmath7 , the parameter of interest , centered at the posterior mean and scaled by the posterior standard deviation which enjoys the same asymptotic properties as the credible interval centered at the mle and scaled by the square root of the reciprocal of the observed fisher information number .",
    "as mentioned in the , this article provides a selective review of objective priors reflecting my own interest and familiarity with the topics .",
    "i am well aware that many important contributions are left out .",
    "for instance , i have discussed only the two - group reference priors of bernardo ( @xcite ) . a more appealing later contribution by berger and bernardo ( @xcite ) provided an algorithm for the construction of multi - group reference priors when these groups are arranged in accordance to their order of importance . in particular , the one - at - a - time reference priors , as advocated by these authors ,",
    "has proved to be quite useful in practice .",
    "ghosal ( @xcite ) provided the construction of reference priors in nonregular cases , while a formal definition of reference priors encompassing both regular and nonregular cases has recently been proposed by berger , bernardo and sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "regarding probability matching priors , we have discussed only the quantile matching criterion .",
    "there are several others , possibly equally important probability matching criteria .",
    "notable among these are the highest posterior density matching criterion as well as matching via inversion of test statistics , such as the likelihood ratio test statistic , rao statistic or the wald statistic .",
    "extensive discussion of such matching priors is given in datta and mukerjee ( @xcite ) .",
    "datta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) constructed matching priors via the prediction criterion , and related exact results in this context are available in fraser and reid ( @xcite ) .",
    "the issue of matching priors in the context of conditional inference has been discussed quite extensively in reid ( @xcite ) .    a different class of priors called `` the maximum likelihood prior '' was developed by hartigan ( @xcite ) .",
    "roughly speaking , these priors are found by maximizing the expected distance between the prior and the posterior under a truncated kullback  leibler distance . like the proposed moment matching priors , the maximum likelihood prior densities ,",
    "when they exist , result in posterior means asymptotically negligible from the mle s .",
    "i have alluded to some of these priors as a comparison with other priors as given in this paper .    with the exception of the right- and left - invariant haar priors ,",
    "the derivation of the remaining priors are based essentially on the asymptotic expansion of the posterior density as well as the shrinkage argument of j. k. ghosh .",
    "this approach provides a nice unified tool for the development of objective priors .",
    "i believe very strongly that many new priors will be found in the future by either a direct application or slight modification of these tools .    the results of this article show that jeffreys prior is a clear winner in the absence of nuisance parameters for most situations .",
    "the only exception is the chi - square divergence where different priors may emerge .",
    "but that corresponds only to one special case , namely , the boundary of the class of divergence priors , while jeffreys prior continues its optimality in the interior . in the presence of nuisance parameters ,",
    "my own recommendation is to find two- or multi - group reference priors following the algorithm of berger and bernardo ( @xcite ) , and then narrow down this class of priors by finding their intersection with the class of probability matching priors .",
    "this approach can even lead to a unique objective prior in some situations .",
    "some simple illustrations are given in this article .",
    "i also want to point out the versatility of reference priors .",
    "for example , for nonregular models , jeffreys general rule prior does not work .",
    "but as shown in ghosal ( @xcite ) and berger , bernardo and sun ( @xcite ) , one can extend the definition of reference priors to cover these situations as well .",
    "the examples given in this paper are purposely quite simplistic to aid understanding mainly of readers not familiar at all with the topic .",
    "quite rightfully , they can be criticized as somewhat stylized .",
    "both reference and probability matching priors , however , have been developed for more complex problems of practical importance . among others",
    ", i may refer to berger and yang ( @xcite ) , berger , de oliveira and sanso ( @xcite ) , ghosh and heo ( @xcite ) , ghosh , carlin and srivastava ( @xcite ) and ghosh , yin and kim ( @xcite ) .",
    "the topics of these papers include time series models , spatial models and inverse problems , such as linear calibration and problems in bioassay , in particular , slope ratio and parallel line assays . one can easily extend this list .",
    "a very useful source for all these papers is bernardo ( @xcite ) .",
    "this research was supported in part by nsf grant number ses-0631426 and nsa grant numbermspf-076 - 097 .",
