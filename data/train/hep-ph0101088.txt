    "deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering experiments have provided precision information about the quark distributions in the nucleon .",
    "however , there has been a long - standing discrepancy between the @xmath1 structure functions extracted from neutrino and muon experiments in the small @xmath2 range .",
    "recently , a new analysis of differential cross sections and structure functions from ccfr @xmath3-fe and @xmath4-fe data was presented ; in this study , the neutrino - muon difference is resolved by extracting the @xmath3 structure functions in a physics model independent way.@xcite    in previous analyses of @xmath3 data,@xcite structure functions were extracted by applying a slow rescaling correction to correct for the charm mass suppression in the final state .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 term ( used as input in the extraction ) was calculated from a leading order charm production model .",
    "these resulted in physics model dependent ( pmd ) structure functions . in the new analysis,@xcite slow rescaling corrections are not applied , and @xmath0 and @xmath1 were extracted from two parameter fits to the data .",
    "the extracted physics model independent ( pmi ) values for @xmath5 are then compared with @xmath6 within the framework of nlo models for massive charm production ; these are found to be in agreement , thus resolving the long - standing discrepancy between the two sets of data . however , the first measurements of @xmath0 are higher than current theoretical predictions .",
    "the objective of this paper is to investigate the sensitivity of @xmath0 upon a variety of factors including renormalization scheme and scale , quark mass effects , higher twist , isospin violation , and pdf uncertainties .    in",
    "we have plotted the quantity @xmath0 for an isoscalar target computed to order @xmath7 . for comparison",
    ", we also display data from the ccfr analysis.@xcite while there is much freedom in the theoretical calculation , the difference between these calculations and the data at low @xmath8 values warrants further investigation .",
    "we will discuss and compare the different theoretical calculations , and examine the inherent uncertainty in each with respect to different input parameters .",
    "we will also examine the experimental input , and assess uncertainties in this data .",
    "the structure functions are defined in terms of the neutrino - nucleon cross section via : @xmath9 \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\label{eq:}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the fermi weak coupling constant , @xmath11 is the nucleon mass , @xmath12 is the incident energy , @xmath13 is the fractional energy transfer , and @xmath14 is the final state hadronic energy .",
    "the sum of @xmath3 and @xmath4 differential cross sections for charged current interactions on an isoscalar target is then : @xmath15    \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\pi}{y^2g_f^2me_\\nu } \\nonumber\\\\ & = &   2xf_1 [ 1+\\epsilon r ] + \\frac{y(1-y/2)}{1+(1-y)^2 } \\delta xf_3   \\label{eq : feps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] is the polarization of the virtual @xmath17 boson . in the above equation ,",
    "we have used the relation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ratio of the cross - sections of longitudinally- to transversely - polarized @xmath17-bosons , @xmath20 is the square of the four - momentum transfer to the nucleon , and @xmath21 is the bjorken scaling variable . for @xmath22 , @xmath23 in neutrino scattering",
    "is expected to be somewhat larger than @xmath23 for muon scattering because of the production of massive charm quarks in the final state for the charged current neutrino production .    using and ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath0 can be extracted separately . because of the positive correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath0 , the extracted values of @xmath1 are rather insensitive to the input @xmath23 .",
    "if a large input @xmath23 is used , a larger value of @xmath24 is extracted from the @xmath25 distribution , thus yielding the same value of @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the extracted values of @xmath0 are sensitive to the assumed value of @xmath23 , which yields a larger systematic error , shown on the data . for @xmath23",
    "the qcd - inspired fit in @xcite is used , but corrected for charged current neutrino scattering using a leading order slow rescaling model .",
    "this gives precisely the same type of correction as a full nlo calculation including the massive charm quark , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , but leads to a somewhat higher normalization than the perturbative correction .",
    "it is arguable which prescription for @xmath23 leads to the better fit to existing data , but the difference between the two leads to an uncertainty in @xmath0 of the order of the systematic error shown . clearly a further reduction in the assumed value of r ( even down to zero ) , as suggested by models including @xmath26 resummations , would still leave a discrepancy between the lowest @xmath20 data points and the theoretical predictions .",
    "now that we have outlined the experimental method used in the extraction of the @xmath27 structure functions , it is instructive to recall the simple leading - order correspondence between the @xmath27 s and the pdf s :     @xmath28 therefore , the combination @xmath0 yields : @xmath29 note that since this quantity involves the parity violating structure function @xmath30 , this measurement has no analogue in the neutral current photon - exchange process .",
    "also note that since , at leading - order , @xmath0 is directly sensitive to the strange and charm distributions , this observable can be used to probe the heavy quark pdf s , and to understand heavy quark ( charm ) production .",
    "we discuss these possibilities further in the following subsection .",
    "we have illustrated in how @xmath0 is closely tied to the heavy quark pdf s .",
    "the questions is : given the present knowledge base , should we use @xmath0 to determine the heavy quark pdf s , or vice verse . to answer this question",
    ", we briefly review present measurements of heavy quark pdf s , and assess their uncertainty .",
    "the precise measurement of @xmath17 plus heavy quark @xmath32 events provides important information on heavy quark pdf s ; additionally , such signals are a background for higgs and squark searches.@xcite    unfortunately , a primary uncertainty for @xmath31 production comes from the heavy quark pdf s . given that @xmath0 is sensitive to these heavy quark pdf s , we see at least two scenarios .",
    "one possibility is that new analysis of present data will resolve this situation prior to run  ii , and provide precise distributions as an input to the tevatron data analysis .",
    "if the situation remains unresolved , then new data from run  ii may help to finally solve this puzzle . in the far future , a neutrino experiment from the neutrino factory at a linear collider would be an ideal tool to measure any neutrino structure function.@xcite      the strange distribution is directly measured by dimuon production in neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "the basic sub - process is @xmath33 with a subsequent charm decay @xmath34 .",
    "dis dimuon measurements have safely established the breaking of the @xmath35 flavor symmetry , @xmath36/2 } \\right|_{q^2={{\\cal{o}}(10{\\rm gev^2 } ) } } \\lesssim \\frac{1}{2 } \\label{eq : kappa}\\ ] ] in the nucleon sea .",
    "still , there remain large uncertainties for the @xmath37-quark distribution in the kinematic regions relevant for @xmath0 , even though the @xmath38-range of the ccfr dimuon measurements @xcite is comparable .",
    "ccfr recorded 5044 @xmath3 and 1062 @xmath4  @xmath39 events with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the more recent nutev experiment recorded a similar sample of events , and these are presently being analysed through a mc simulation based on nlo quark- and gluon - initiated corrections at differential level@xcite .",
    "a complete nlo analysis of this data together with a global analysis may help to further constraint the strange quark distribution .    at present ,",
    "pdf sets take strangeness suppresssion into account by imposing the constraint in as @xmath44/2 $ ] at the pdf input scale @xmath45 , @xcite or by evolving @xmath46 from a vanishing input at a lower scale.@xcite the residual uncertainty can be large , as can be seen from the collection of strange seas in .    in the following , we will take the uncertainty in the strange pdf into account by relaxing the experimental constraint in as implemented in the mrst partons.@xcite this will be discussed in .",
    "the strange distribution can also be extracted indirectly using a combination of charged ( @xmath5 ) and neutral ( @xmath6 ) current structure functions ; however , the systematic uncertainties involved in this procedure make an accurate determination difficult.@xcite the basic idea is to use the ( leading - order ) relation @xmath47 to extract the strange distribution . here",
    ", @xmath48 represents a sum over all quark flavors .",
    "this method is complicated by a number of issues including the @xmath24 component which can play a crucial role in the small-@xmath2 region ",
    "precisely the region where we observe the discrepancy . from the corresponding relation : @xmath49 we see that these problems are not independent ; however , this information , together with the exclusive dimuon events , may provide a more precise determination of the strange quark sea , and help to resolve our puzzle .    prior to the dis dimuon data , the 1992 cteq1 analysis @xcite found that a combination of nc structure functions from nmc@xcite and the physics - model - dependent charged current structure functions from ccfr @xcite seem compatible with approximate @xmath35-symmetry , _ i.e. _ , @xmath50 in .",
    "recent dimuon measurements now exclude an @xmath35-symmetry @xmath51 .",
    "we shall explore the effect of @xmath52 on @xmath53 in .",
    "we now systematically investigate the sensitivity of the theoretical predictions of @xmath0 upon a variety of factors including : renormalization scheme and scale , quark mass effects , higher twist , isospin violation , and pdf uncertainties .    to simplify this analysis",
    ", we first examine the influence of these factors on the lo expression : @xmath54 ; after using this as a  toy model , \" we will then return to the full nlo calculation in the next section .",
    "asymmetry @xcite would average out in @xmath0 . ] for most variables , the simplified lo is sufficient to display the general behavior of the full nlo result .",
    "there are two exceptions : 1 ) the scheme dependence , and 2 ) the pdf dependence .",
    "these factors depend on the interplay of both the quark - initiated lo contributions as well as the nlo gluon - initiated contributions . for this reason",
    ", we will postpone discussion of these effects until the following section .",
    "we start by examining the effect of the charm mass , @xmath55 , on @xmath0 . in",
    ", we plot the leading - order expression @xmath54 _ vs. _ @xmath20 for values of @xmath55 in the range @xmath56 $ ] gev using steps of 0.2 gev . here",
    ", we define @xmath57 which is a  slow - rescaling \" type of correction@xcite which ( crudely ) includes mass effects by shifting the @xmath2 variable .",
    "`` slow rescaling '' naturally arises at lo from the single - charm threshold condition(@xmath58 ) and is required at nlo for consistent mass factorization @xcite .",
    "note , the result of this correction is most significant at low @xmath20 . to isolate the kinematic @xmath55 dependence ,",
    "we have chosen the scale @xmath59 .",
    "( we will separately vary the scale in the following subsection . )",
    "note that this exercise is only altering the charm mass in one aspect of the calculation ; to be entirely consistent it would be necessary to obtain parton distributions ( particularly the charm quark ) using fits with different charm masses . for charm masses in the range",
    "1.2 to 1.8 gev , this will be a small effect ; for charm masses below @xmath60 gev , ( which is below the experimentally allowed range@xcite ) , such issues become important and the curves of will be modified , i.e.  lower @xmath55 will lead to longer evolution for charm , a larger charm distribution , and a lowering of the curves in .",
    "while taking @xmath61 does raise the theoretical curves in the regions where we observe the discrepancy ( namely , the low @xmath8 region ) , varying @xmath55 even within the wide range of @xmath62 $ ] gev ( lower 4 curves ) does not give us sufficient flexibility to match either the shape or normalization of the data .",
    "next , we investigate the variation of @xmath54 with the renormalization / factorization scale @xmath63 .",
    "we use three choices of the @xmath64 scale :    * @xmath65  , * @xmath66  , * @xmath67  .    of course , @xmath0 with @xmath64 scales of @xmath20 and @xmath68 differ only at lower values of @xmath20 ; @xmath0 with @xmath64 scale of @xmath69 is comparable to @xmath20 and @xmath68 at larger @xmath2 , but lies below for smaller @xmath2 .",
    "the scale choice @xmath68 leads to an improvment over @xmath20 by providing a lower bound on @xmath63 to keep the scale in the perturbative region .",
    "the choice of @xmath70 is motivated , in part , by some observations by collins.@xcite to display the relationship between @xmath70 and @xmath8 , in we plot both @xmath70 and @xmath8 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath2 for 4 choices of @xmath25 ; note@xcite that the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath70 is opposite that of @xmath8 .",
    "while tying the scale choice of @xmath63 to @xmath70 has some interesting intuitive interpretations , of the partonic subprocess , but this is unobservable ; therefore @xmath70 is used instead.@xcite ] for small @xmath2 this scale clearly becomes too large for the relevant physics . in any case , it can not help us with our @xmath71 problem as the scale choice of @xmath70 moves the theory curves _",
    "away _ from the data .",
    "we now illustrate the potential effects due to higher twist contributions .",
    "we parameterize such contributions by multiplying the leading - twist terms by a correction factor that will increase at low @xmath20 .",
    "more specifically we use:@xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "we vary @xmath74 over the range [ 0,10 ] @xmath75 in steps of @xmath76 .",
    "( for the purposes of our simple illustration , it is sufficient to take @xmath74 to be independent of @xmath2 . )",
    "we will find that this range is well beyond what is allowed by experiment ; however , we display this exaggerated range to make the effect of the higher twist contributions evident .    to normalize this choice with the allowable range consistent with data ,",
    "we compare with the mrst higher twist fit which extracted a limit on the function @xmath77 .",
    "we see from the table of @xmath77 that the allowed contribution from the higher twist terms is quite small .",
    "in addition , we note that the sign for @xmath77 obtained for the relevant small-@xmath2 region tends to be negative  exactly the opposite sign that is needed to move the theory toward the data .",
    "as we have shown constraints on @xmath77 , the obvious question is should we expect @xmath74 to be substantially different ?",
    "a calculation of the power corrections using renormalons@xcite suggests that while both @xmath78 and @xmath74 are of the same order of magnitude as @xmath77 and have similar @xmath2-dependence , that @xmath78 and @xmath74 are even more negative than @xmath77 ; again , this trend would move the theory farther from the data .",
    "therefore , we conclude that that @xmath77 represents a conservative limit for the @xmath74 power corrections .    examining",
    ", we note that it would take an enormous higher twist contribution to bring the normalization of the curves in the range of the data points , and still the shape of the @xmath20-dependence is not well matched ; hence , we conclude that this is not a compelling solution .",
    "the naive parton model identity in is modified if the full ( non - diagonal ) ckm structure , nlo qcd radiative corrections , and qcd based charm production are taken into account .",
    "this expression is also modified _ even in leading - order _ if we have a violation of exact @xmath79 isospin - symmetry , ( or charge symmetry ) ; _ e.g. _ , @xmath80 . in deriving ,",
    "isospin - symmetry was necessary to guarantee that the @xmath81-contributions cancel out in the difference , thereby leaving only the @xmath46 and @xmath82 contributions .",
    "the validity of exact _ charge symmetry _ ( cs ) has recently been reexamined.@xcite residual @xmath81-contributions to @xmath0 from _ charge symmetry violation _ ( csv ) would be amplified due to enhanced valence components @xmath83 , and because the @xmath84 transitions are not subject to slow - rescaling corrections which strongly suppress the @xmath85 contribution to @xmath0 , as illustrated in .",
    "we will examine possible contributions to @xmath0 by considering a `` toy '' model to parameterize the cs - violations .",
    "in isospin space , we can parameterize a general transformation as a rotation : @xmath86 where @xmath23 is a rotation matrix , and @xmath87 is the normalization factor .",
    "for example , in this model the @xmath88-distribution in the neutron would be related to the proton distributions via the relation : @xmath89\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath90 , we recover the symmetric limit @xmath91 . note that we define the normalization @xmath92 such that this model preserves the sum rule : @xmath93 note that should not be considered a serious theory , but rather a simple one - parameter ( @xmath94 ) model which is flexible enough to illustrate a range of csv effects for @xmath0 .    in",
    "we vary @xmath94 over the its maximum range @xmath95 $ ] in steps of @xmath96 . the exact charge symmetry limit ( @xmath97 ) of corresponds to the lowest curve in .",
    "note the effect of the csv contribution monotonically increases as @xmath94 deviates from the charge symmetry ( cs ) limit @xmath98 . from the plot we observe that a violation of @xmath99 is required to bring the theory in the neighborhood of the data .",
    "at the relevant @xmath2 values of interest for @xmath0 , this translates ( via and its analogue for @xmath100 ) into a @xmath101 symmetry violation for @xmath102 , and a @xmath103 symmetry violation for @xmath100 .",
    "specifically , @xmath104 since the electroweak couplings are flavor - independent , ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath0 is in principle insensitive to a re - shuffling of the csv contributions between @xmath102 and @xmath100 .",
    "in particular , if we define the shift due to csv in @xmath0 as @xmath106 , we find : @xmath107 where @xmath108 the expression for @xmath109 of is evaluated at @xmath110 from with @xmath111 and is plotted in .-shape from should _ not _ be taken as a serious model prediction . ]",
    "although this level of isospin violation certainly improves the description of @xmath0 , it is necessary to consider precisely what level of violation is actually allowed by other experimental data .",
    "for instance , it has previously been suggested that the discrepancy between @xmath1 from neutrino and muon data itself may be due to isospin violation.@xcite this type of violation required that @xmath112 be very different to @xmath113 in the region of interest .",
    "the measurement of the lepton charge asymmetry in w decays from the tevatron @xcite places tight constraints on the up and down quark distributions in the range @xmath114 , constraining them to be approximately as specified in the parton sets obtained by the global analyses . while only strictly telling us about parton distributions in the proton , this data rules out an isospin violation of this type to about @xmath115 as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "however , there are other strong constraints on isospin violation . for example",
    ", we note that while the toy model above leaves the neutron singlet combination @xmath116 invariant at the @xmath117 level in the region @xmath118 $ ] , it would lower the nc observable : @xmath119_n \\    \\right|_{x\\epsilon [ 0.01;0.1]}\\ ] ] by about 10% .",
    "an effect of this size would definitely be visible in nmc @xmath120 data which has an uncertainty of order a few percent in this kinematic region , and acts as a major constraint.@xcite    at this point , one could play clever games to evade the constraints of specific experiments .",
    "for example , a re - shuffling of csv contributions between the individual @xmath121 in according to : @xmath122 would keep invariant .",
    "however , this would in turn raise the cc observable by @xmath123 ; though it would help to explain the excess in @xmath124 , it would spoil the new - found compatibility between neutral current and charged current data .",
    "in addition , there are also fixed - target drell - yan experiments@xcite such as na51 and e866 which precisely measure @xmath125 in the range@xcite @xmath126 , and are also sensitive to isospin violating effects .",
    "we therefore conclude that the many precise data sets which constrain different combinations of the pdf s probably leave no room for csv contributions of the magnitude necessary to fully align the theory curves with the @xmath0 data .",
    "however , we should add the caveat that an exhaustive investigation of the interplay of these different data sets and their influence on @xmath0 will only be possible within a global pdf analysis",
    "now that we have used the leading - order expression for @xmath0 to systematically investigate dependence of this observable on various parameters , in this section we now turn to the full nlo calculation .      in , we have plotted the lo and nlo calculations for @xmath53 _ vs. _ @xmath20 on an isoscalar target in 3 and 4 flavor schemes .",
    "the 3-flavor lo calculation ( f=3 , @xmath128 ) involves primarily the strange quark contribution , @xmath46 , as the charm distribution is excluded in this case . when the higher order terms are included ( f=3 , @xmath7 ) , this result moves ( substantially ) toward the predictions of the 4-flavor scheme .",
    "we note that while the 3-flavor lo calculation ( f=3 , @xmath128 ) appears consistent with the data , we can not take this result as a precise theoretical prediction as this simplistic result is highly dependent on scheme and scale choices ; a result that is verified by the large shift in going from lo to nlo .",
    "the pair of curves in the 4-flavor scheme ( using the cteq4hq distributions ) nicely illustrates how the charm distribution @xmath129 evolves as @xmath130 for increasing @xmath20 ; note , @xmath129 enters with a negative sign so that the 4-flavor result is below the 3-flavor curve . for the scale choice , we take @xmath131 .",
    "while the scale choice @xmath132 is useful for instructive purposes such as demonstrating the matching of the 3- and 4-flavor calculations at @xmath133 , the choice @xmath131 is more practical as it provides a lower bound on @xmath63 which is important for the pdf s and @xmath134 .",

    "additionally we note the stability of the 4-flavor scheme in contrast to the 3-flavor scheme .",
    "the shift of the curves when including the nlo contributions is quite minimal , particularly when compared with the 3-flavor result.@xcite this suggests that organizing the calculation to include the charm quark as a proton constituent can be advantageous even at relatively low values of the energy scale .      in",

    "this prediction is marginally consistent at the outer reach of the systematic + statistical error bars .    finally , we take an @xmath35 symmetric set ( @xmath141 ) purely for illustrative purposes .",
    "it is interesting to note that even this extreme value is still below the central value of the data points at the higher @xmath2 values .",
    "in conclusion we note that increasing the strange quark distribution does succeed in moving the theory toward the data ; however , our consistent nlo analysis presented here suggests that the we have only limited freedom to increase @xmath46 , and that this alone is not sufficient to obtain good agreement between theory and data .      in our final section , we present the best theoretical predictions presently available to demonstrate the scheme dependence of @xmath142 .",

    "in hindsight , this result is simply a consequence of the fact that while different renormalization schemes can produce different results , this difference can only be higher order .",

    "we have explored the variation of @xmath150 on the above factors and found none of these to be capable of resolving the discrepancy between the data and theory .",
    "although we have not eliminated the possibility that the entire set of parameters conspires to align the theory with the data , we have demonstrated this to be extremely unlikely .",
