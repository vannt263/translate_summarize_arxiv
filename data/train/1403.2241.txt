    "color confinement in su(n ) gauge theory is believed to be due to the linearly - increasing potential between colored objects when they are separated .",

    "such a correction could be imitated through a tachyonic gluon mass  @xcite . however , the theoretic origin is not clear because no dimension-@xmath0 gauge invariant operator exists .",
    "the linear potential leads to the area law of wilson loop expectation value . in the gauge / string duality  @xcite",

    "now let us extend the discussion to finite temperature .",
    "recent lattice data has uncovered some similar phenomena in the deconfining phase of su(n ) gauge theory .",

    ", the data can be fitted extremely well .",
    "such an behavior can be made manifest when the trace anomaly is plotted scaled by @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the result is almost constant in the temperature region @xmath3 .",
    "similar as the quark potential , the thermal quadratic term could also be induced from the presence of massive gluons  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the quartic term related to the bag constant , the quadratic term is suggested to reflect the bag thickness in the relevant temperature region  @xcite . the corresponding model with both of them , and even higher power terms ,",
    "is then called  fuzzy bags \" .",
    "such a behavior is further confirmed for pure su(n ) gauge theory with various @xmath4  @xcite , and suggested to hold even in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "another observation concerns the behavior of the polyakov loop above phase transition . at finite temperature ,",
    "the polyakov loop attains nonzero value in the deconfining phase , and serves as the order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , lattice results  @xcite for the logarithmic of the polyakov loop in su(3 ) gauge theory is also dominated by @xmath5 term  @xcite . such a behavior is confirmed recently in su(4 ) and su(5 ) gauge theory  @xcite , and the coefficient of the quadratic term has little dependence on the gauge group .    as proposed in  @xcite , deconfinement of su@xmath6 gauge theory in the large @xmath4 limit can be described as the transition between the thermal gas phase and the black hole phase on the gravity side .",

    "second , @xmath67 when @xmath68 . with these two properties",

    "due to the quickly increasing near @xmath69 , the maximum is expected to appear close to @xmath69 .",
    "that means , close to @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , the shape of all the physical quantities can be obtained by smoothly connecting their asymptotic form in the two limits .",
    "there will be no special structure in between , since there is no special point in the black hole solution .",
    "in particular , the phase transition is not an intrinsic property of the black hole solution . for example",

    "it has also been extended to describe the behavior of the bulk viscosity  @xcite and the polyakov loop  @xcite . in a similar way",
    ", one may explain the enhancement of jet quenching around phase transition , recently pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we want to compare our result for the trace anomaly with the lattice fit in more detail . above the phase transition ,",
    "the lattice fit ( [ eq.theta0 ] ) simplifies due to the large exponential factor as @xmath75 such a fit form was first proposed in @xcite .",

    "the pressure then takes the form @xmath82 which is called the fuzzy bag model  @xcite .",
    "taking the high temperature expansion of ( [ eq.d / p ] ) , we find @xmath83 actually such a truncated expansion is almost exact above @xmath58 .",
    "comparing with ( [ eq.theta1 ] ) , we immediately obtain @xmath84 we see indeed violation of conformal invariance is mainly due to a quadratic correction , with the coefficient @xmath85 close to the lattice value extrapolated to large @xmath4 .",
    "the sign of @xmath76 is also the same as the lattice result for pure gauge theory , and differs from that in qcd at zero temperature and at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "however , the absolute value of @xmath76 is about two times bigger than that from the lattice fit .",
    "such a large negative @xmath76 has significant effects around the phase transition , and leads to the smallness of the latent heat .",

    "is approximately evaluated through the minimum area @xmath87 of the string worldsheet ending on the temporal loop  @xcite @xmath88 due to the different topologies of the solutions shown in the previous section , such a string worldsheet may exist or not  @xcite .",
    "the topology of the thermal ads is @xmath89 , while the ads - schwarzschild black hole is @xmath90 . due to this , in the first case no such string worldsheet exists and the corresponding polyakov loop is vanishing .",

    "a nonzero value of the polyakov loop is thus generated , signaling unconfinement in the black hole phase .",
    "now we calculate the quark free energy explicitly , through the area of the string worldsheet @xmath93 the area is simply that of the @xmath92 part spanned by @xmath16 and @xmath94 @xmath95 the integral is divergent .",
    "a finite free energy , and thus @xmath31 , can be obtained by slightly shifting the upper bound of the @xmath94 integral away from the boundary point @xmath96 .",

    "above @xmath117 the deviation between the two curves becomes large , where the lattice result overshoots the asymptotic value .",
    "again this is due to the difference between our prediction and the lattice fit ( [ eq.log-l-fit ] ) for the parameter @xmath101 .",
    "introducing a nonzero value of @xmath101 as in @xcite by hand reduces the deviation .",
    "however , it is not clear if the fithe deviation could be due to the perturbative contributions not included here . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the perturbative result approaches the asymptotic value from above , which could be the reason why the polyakov loop overshoots unity .",
    "the lattice data in @xmath118 dimension shows that the trace anomaly , normalized in unit of @xmath119 , is dominated by a linear term in inverse temperature  @xcite .",
    "this could be compared with the behavior of the quark potential at zero temperature .",
    "we know in this case the perturbative potential is logarithmic , and the linear confining potential , if existing , would be roughly the linear correction at short distance .",
    "it is also proposed that such a term could be completely due to the leading perturbative corrections  @xcite .",
    "our present calculation shows that for any space dimension @xmath120 , the quadratic term in inverse temperature makes the dominant contribution to @xmath121 .",
    "the contradiction with the lattice result indicates that the hawking - page transition is not proper to describe deconfinement in @xmath118 dimension .",
    "this can be anticipated , since we do not know whether the duality can be generalized to @xmath122 or not",
    ".    as for the polyakov loop , the quadratic term is vanishing when @xmath123 .",
    "this could be compared with the fact that in @xmath124 dimension the pertubative potential by itself is linear . in @xmath118 dimension ,",
    "( [ eq.b - theory ] ) seems to indicate the existence of a nonzero quadratic term .",
    "again , this may not be the true situation , due to the same reasoning as the trace anomaly .",
    "we have shown that the quadratic thermal terms observed in lattice data can be generated naturally on the gravity side .",
    "the reason can be traced back to the difference of the bulk metric when the boundary is compact or not .",
    "if one naively compares metric ( [ eq.tads1 ] ) with ( [ eq.tads2 ] ) , one finds that in ( [ eq.tads1 ] ) there is an additional constant term in the warp factor .",
    "the same pattern can also be found comparing ( [ eq.ads-bh1 ] ) with ( [ eq.ads-bh2 ] ) . according to the dictionary of the duality  @xcite",
    ", such a term would correspond to a dimension-2 operator at the boundary , or a tachyonic field in the bulk . in our calculation",
    "no such field is introduced , and the correction is completely due to change of the boundary topology .",
    "the comparison between the thermal properties of the theory on @xmath125 and @xmath126 also shows that such contributions appear together with the phase transition .",
    "therefore they could the embers of confinement above @xmath58 , i.e. , the remaining effects of the linear potential in the deconfined phase .",
    "combining the confinement argument in  @xcite through the wilson loop , one may suspect that these quadratic terms are also due to global change of the bulk spacetime , rather than some local effects .",
    "the price to pay for such contributions , and confinement , in the present case is the compactness of the boundary space .",
    "therefore the properties found here may not be directly related to those in ordinary space time .",
    "however , the idea behind the model could be employed to describe realistic gauge theory . as we have explained ,",
    "the shape of all the quantities in the model can be obtained by combining the behavior at @xmath69 and in the high temperature limit .",
    "therefore , the results presented here could be universal among theories with a minimum temperature of the black hole phase .",
    "the numerous studies in the gravity - dilaton system have partially confirmed this . in particular , it is pointed out that the existence of a minimum temperature of the black hole solution is related to confinement  @xcite .",
    "if this is in general true , the results shown here may be extended to all confining theories .",
