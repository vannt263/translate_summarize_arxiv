    "in the last few years , the increasingly detailed observations of stellar populations in a wide variety of environments have provided a huge amount of high quality data , which have been used to constrain both stellar evolution theory and stellar models among many other variables .",
    "in contrast , the development of increasingly complicated evolutionary synthesis codes has , in general , focused only on the use of updated physical ingredients , but some of their underlying hypotheses ( track interpolation and isochrone computation in particular ) have remained unchanged .",
    "unfortunately , their self - consistency are difficult to test and there are some theoretical and practical open questions without an answer .",
    "an homology transformation gives us a scale relation of a property @xmath0 of stars ( l , t@xmath1 , @xmath2 ) with their mass , @xmath3 , mean molecular weight , @xmath4 , nuclear energy production , @xmath5 , opacity coefficient , @xmath6 , and hydrogen abundance in the core , @xmath7 , for the same configuration .",
    "as an example , for the cno burning , kramers opacity law and radiative transport configuration the relations are :    @xmath8    other configurations means , mainly , a change in the exponents . these relations , together with @xmath9 , allow us to define equivalent evolutionary points : points where @xmath6 , @xmath4 ( structure ) and @xmath5 , @xmath7 ( burning state ) are similar .",
    "then , interpolations must be done in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "note that the @xmath3 value used in the homology relations _ does not refer to the initial mass _ , but the current mass of the star in the equivalent evolutionary point .",
    "this simple scheme would be a good approximation if ( a ) the stellar tracks are close enough , ( b ) there are no discontinuities in the stellar evolution ( i.e. adjacent tracks `` resemble '' each other ) , and ( c ) stellar winds do not vary the stellar evolution . unfortunately , these conditions are not always true .",
    "there are intrinsic discontinuities in the stellar evolution at low mass ( c.f .",
    "@xcite @xcite ) and high mass ( wolf - rayet , wr , vs. non - wr tracks ) . the problem is specially dramatic in high - mass stars , where the effects of stellar winds strongly affects the stellar evolution and burning lifetimes of the stars , and may produce failures in the use of homology relations when the initial mass is used .",
    "even more , there are no homology relations to compute mass lost rates ( which are , indeed , an input of the evolutionary tracks ) neither the surface abundances ( which are related with the internal structure and the mass lost rate and which are fundamental for obtain the wr population ) .",
    "it means that , at least in the case of massive stars , where the mass lost rates affects the stellar evolution , _ isochrones do not necessary reflect the physics of the assumed tracks _ if they are obtained from the interpolation of the initial mass ( as it is usual in synthesis codes for starburst galaxies ) .",
    "assuming that the isochrone reflect the input physics used in the evolutionary tracks , the next step is to populate the isochrone and obtain the integrated properties .",
    "it can be done by a direct convolution of the isochrone with the initial mass function ( imf ) and the star fromation rate , together with the individual stellar properties .",
    "this integration can be done using monte carlo simulations ( where the number of stars used in the simulation plays a fundamental role ) , analytical integrations ( but it is needed an analytical formulation of the isochrone and the stellar properties ) , or numerical integrations ( where the mass intervals must be chosen in such a way that all the relevant evolutionary phases are correctly included in the computation ) .    other possible solution is the use of the so - called _ fuel consumption theorem , fct , _ @xcite . in this case , the relevant post - main sequence stages are approximated by a single stellar track of the star with mass at the turn - off point of the main sequence , @xmath11 .",
    "note that it is needed to assure that the isochrone and the @xmath11 stellar track are similar enough .",
    "i refer to @xcite ( @xcite , sect .",
    "2 ) or @xcite ( @xcite ) for more information .",
    "however , the results of synthesis codes differs qualitatively , depending on the way how this integration is performed ...",
    "the final question is the comparison of the results of synthesis models with real data . in this case , it must be taken into account that ( 1 ) synthesis models give us a _",
    "mean _ value of the observed properties ( that is only exact in the asymptotic limit of an infinite number of stars in the cluster ) , and ( 2 ) the total luminosity of the modeled cluster must be larger than the individual luminosity of any of the stars included in the model .",
    "this last constrain imposes a minimum amount of stars ( or , equivalently , a minimum initial stellar cluster mass for single stellar populations or star forming rate for composed ones ) where the results of synthesis models can be compared safely with real data .",
    "this limits is around 10@xmath12 m@xmath13 for a single stellar population using a salpeter imf slope in the range 0.09120 m@xmath13 ( c.f .",
    "cervio 2002 submitted ) . below this limit , the presence of @xmath14 star may influence the resulting properties and sampling effects must be included in the model .",
    "even more , the resulting properties may show bimodal distributions and the results of synthesis models may be biased respect the the observed properties ( cervio & valls - gabaud 2002 ) . the relevance of these sampling effects have been illustrated in @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite , see also @xcite @xcite and references therein for an analytical formalism ) .",
    "these sampling effects may also play an important role in chemical evolution models , as it is shown in @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is needed a more careful ( physical ) study in the way how interpolations between tracks are done , specially for massive stars ( wr ) .",
    "there are also some open questions that , at this moment , had not been solved theoretically , as example : what is the scheme needed to obtain realistic results for systems with metallicities that differs from the one tabulated in tracks and isochrones ?",
    "how homology relations works in rotating stars ?    from the observational point of view , any comparison of the results of synthesis models with real data must take into account that the synthesis model results are a band , with a intrinsic dispersion that depends on the cluster stellar mass , instead an infinitely narrow line .",
    "evermore , there is an intrinsic limit in the cluster stellar mass below any comparison of observed data with synthesis models must be performed including sampling effects in the model .",
    "useful comments have been provided by valentina luridiana and enrique prez .",
    "this project has been partially supported by the aya 3939-c03 - 01 program .",
    "i also thanks the ce for financial support for attending the conference ."
