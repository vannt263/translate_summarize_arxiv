    "the application of holography to non - relativistic theories represents an interesting extension of the usual holographic dictionary .",
    "the simplest example of this type is the lifshitz spacetime @xcite .",
    "the geometry is @xmath3 where there are @xmath4 spatial dimensions @xmath5 , and we have set the curvature scale to one for convenience .",
    "the spacetime has an isometry under @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 which realizes the anisotropic scaling symmetry of the dual field theory .",
    "the holographic dictionary for this spacetime generally has a similar structure to that for ads ( which corresponds to @xmath1 ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one of the significant differences is that while ads had a smooth extension beyond @xmath9 , the geometry has a singularity there , as noted in @xcite and emphasized in @xcite .",
    "scalar curvature invariants constructed from are necessarily finite  indeed , constant  as a consequence of the lifshitz symmetry , but there are divergent tidal forces as we approach @xmath10 along geodesic congruences .",
    "the consequences of this singularity for observers in the spacetime were explored in @xcite , who argued that observers near the singularity would experience large effects , although in a particular model , @xcite found that including the effects of the matter background made the effects on a test string finite .",
    "however , it is not so clear how this singularity is reflected in observables in the dual field theory .",
    "the correlation functions of local field theory operators are not sensitive to the singularity , as they can be obtained from analytic continuation of euclidean correlators , and the euclidean spacetime is not singular . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that the singularity could be reflected in the structure of the infrared divergences in scattering amplitudes .",
    "scattering amplitudes are an intrinsically lorentzian observable , and it is well - known that in massless theories they have infrared divergences associated with the emission of soft collinear particles .",
    "the singularity in the spacetime in the geometry is related to the dual field theory having more soft modes , as the anisotropic scaling symmetry implies a dispersion relation @xmath11 .",
    "the ir divergences in scattering amplitudes therefore seems a suitable place to look for observable effects of this physics .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate this by calculating the scattering amplitudes following the pioneering work of @xcite in the ads case . in that work ,",
    "the scattering amplitude was related to the calculation of a minimal surface ( following @xcite in the flat space case ) .",
    "the appropriate minimal surface was obtained in @xcite by working in a t - dual geometry where it is a minimal surface ending on light - like segments on the asymptotic boundary of the t - dual spacetime , whose geometry is again ads .",
    "this gives the leading behaviour of the amplitude as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the action of a string wrapping the minimal surface determined by the boundary conditions ; this represents a stationary point approximation to the amplitude . in the case of @xmath14 sym",
    ", the scattering amplitude can be related to a wilson loop @xcite , and can then be understood in terms of the saddle - point calculation of the dual wilson loop ; the leading ir singularity is then related to the cusp anomalous dimension @xcite .",
    "we are not claiming that such an amplitude - wilson loop duality extends to the lifshitz field theories ; we simply want to use as a convenient trick to evaluate the leading behaviour of the amplitude , working in a t - dual frame because it s easier to find the minimal surface there , in the spirit of the discussion in @xcite .",
    "this can perhaps be made more rigorous in the context of the string embedding of @xmath15 lifshitz spacetime in @xcite , or in the construction of @xcite , but we will leave this as a problem for the future .",
    "in the ads case , the external states in the scattering amplitude have a dispersion relation @xmath16 determined by the conformal invariance , and the amplitude is related to a closed polygonal wilson loop made up of light - like segments whose lengths are related to the momenta of the external particle states . in @xcite ,",
    "the expectation value of the wilson loop related to the four - point amplitude was shown to be related by conformal invariance to a simple case with two light like segments meeting in a cusp , originally analysed in @xcite . in ads , the minimal surface corresponding to this cusp is simply @xmath17 which satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath9 at @xmath18 .",
    "we will consider the analogue of this cusp in the lifshitz case .",
    "since we have less symmetry than in ads , this is no longer related to the wilson loop with four segments , and finding the appropriate minimal surface in the bulk for a full scattering amplitude is much more difficult . but considering this cusp will suffice to enable us to control the leading ir singularity in the amplitude .    in section",
    "[ dual ] , we will set up the calculation in lifshitz .",
    "in the lifshitz case , the anisotropic scaling symmetry determines the dispersion relation to be @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an undetermined parameter which would be fixed by the microscopic details of the field theory .",
    "since we ca nt control these details of the field theory , we will look for minimal surfaces satisfying @xmath9 at @xmath21 , treating @xmath20 as a free parameter .",
    "the lines @xmath21 are timelike in the boundary at @xmath22 for any @xmath20 because of the non - relativistic causal structure in the boundary of .",
    "therefore in section [ timel ] we will give a brief discussion of null and timelike cusps in the ads case , to fix expectations for the behaviour of our results as @xmath2 .",
    "then in section [ min ] we find the minimal surfaces satisfying these boundary conditions , and determine the leading ir divergences in the amplitudes .",
    "we will find that these minimal surfaces have a peculiar `` mushroom '' shape , where the surface initially bends away to larger @xmath23 before turning around .",
    "the leading divergence is controlled by the near - boundary behaviour of the surface .",
    "we find this divergence is stronger than in the corresponding timelike cusps for @xmath1 , with a universal ( @xmath24-indepenent ) dependence on the cutoff with a coefficient which vanishes as we take the limit .",
    "this result is reminiscent of the behaviour of the bulk singularity , where curvature diverges as @xmath25 along the worldline of geodesics which approach the singularity ( where @xmath26 is the proper time ) , with a coefficient which vanishes as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it should be understood in the field theory as due to the presence of the higher density of soft modes implied by the modified dispersion relation @xmath11 .",
    "we are interested in considering a scattering amplitude in the lifshitz background .",
    "this involves insertion of on - shell particles in the boundary field theory at @xmath27 . in the bulk , it is determined by a string world sheet located near the singularity @xmath28 in ; it is thus infrared divergent .",
    "this divergence can be cut off as in @xcite , by considering a brane at some fixed @xmath29 ( taking @xmath30 at the end of the calculation ) .",
    "the regulated amplitude is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32\\ ] ] is the nambu - goto action of the string worldsheet , and the string world sheet has a boundary on the regulating brane at @xmath29 , with dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath33 and neumann boundary conditions on the field theory directions .",
    "we approximate the scattering amplitude by a saddle point which extremizes subject to these boundary conditions .    as in @xcite , the minimal surface",
    "is more easily obtained by working in the t - dual coordinates , t - dualizing along the boundary directions @xmath34 .",
    "we view this as a trick to obtain the minimal surface we are interested in living in the original spacetime , so we will not carefully investigate this t - duality transformation .",
    "this has been studied extensively in the ads case @xcite , and some of those results may admit extensions to the lifshitz context , at least in the context of the supersymmetric realizations of @xmath15 lifshitz in @xcite , but we will not investigate this further .",
    "t - dualizing along @xmath35 , @xmath36 to t - dual coordinates @xmath37 gives us back a lifshitz spacetime in the coordinates @xmath38 , but with a different dilaton field @xmath39 .",
    "the minimal surface we wanted to find thus becomes an extremum of the nambu - goto action in terms of the t - dual coordinates , with a boundary at @xmath40 with dirichlet boundary conditions in the @xmath37 directions .",
    "the momentum of the external states becomes separation in the @xmath37 directions , so the boundary of the string worldsheet is fixed to lie on a closed polygon at @xmath41 made up of segments with @xmath42 for some @xmath20 . in the limit @xmath30",
    ", this is a polygon in the boundary @xmath43 of the t - dual spacetime .",
    "our main aim is to find the minimal surface satisfying these boundary conditions .",
    "actually , this is rather difficult for a non - trivial polygon , so we will consider just the corner between two such segments ; that is , we take the boundary conditions for our minimal surface to be @xmath44 at @xmath45 , for @xmath46 . since two segments define a plane , we can orient our coordinates such that the separation is just along one of the spatial directions in the lifshitz metric , and the minimal surface will lie in a three - dimensional subspace of .",
    "we will henceforth drop the primes on the dual coordinates .",
    "our interest is then in finding a minimal surface in the three - dimensional subspace @xmath47 satisfying the cusp boundary conditions @xmath10 at @xmath21 for @xmath48 .",
    "one might be tempted to parametrize the surface by @xmath49 , but we will find that it is actually not a single - valued function of @xmath23 : the surface moves initially to larger @xmath23 as @xmath33 increases , before returning to smaller @xmath23 .",
    "using the fact that the action is invariant under @xmath50 , the surface satisfying our boundary conditions will be symmetric under @xmath50 , so we can restrict attention to the surface for @xmath51 .",
    "we can then parametrize the surface for @xmath51 by @xmath52 . using the scaling symmetry ,",
    "a more convenient choice of parametrization of this surface is in terms of @xmath53 where @xmath54 our task is to determine the form of @xmath55 which extremizes the nambu - goto action , subject to the boundary condition @xmath56 for some arbitrary parameter @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 at some @xmath60 .",

    "+ f^{2z+1 } ( 3z+1 ) u u'^2 + [ f^2(f^{2z } ( z-1 ) + z^2 ( z+1 ) ) - 2z f^{2z } u^2 ] u ' \\\\ \\nonumber      - ( z-1 ) f^{2z+1 } u = 0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the points at which @xmath63 = 0\\ ] ] are singular points of .",
    "the choice of parametrization thus reduces the problem to an ode .",
    "this is a complicated non - linear ode , but it is straightforward to solve numerically when @xmath64 does not change sign .",
    "before discussing the solutions of in the lifshitz case , it is useful to briefly return to ads by setting @xmath1 .",
    "this equation then simplifies , and analytic solutions can be found for @xmath65 , corresponding to a null cusp in the boundary .",
    "there are in fact two analytic solutions satisfying the boundary conditions , @xmath66 , which corresponds to the solution , which is spacelike in the bulk , and @xmath67 , which corresponds to a null surface in the bulk spacetime . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the action vanishes identically . for @xmath68 , @xmath69 where in the second step",
    "we have kept the part that gives the leading divergence near @xmath70 .",
    "we want to introduce a cutoff @xmath71 to regulate this divergence .",
    "this corresponds to cutting off the @xmath72 integral at @xmath73 , and cutting off the range of @xmath74 at @xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "thus the leading divergence is @xmath77 in the lifshitz case , the boundary conditions correspond to a timelike cusp in the boundary , so it will be useful to understand the minimal surfaces for timelike cusps in ads to facilitate the comparison for the @xmath2 limit of our results .",
    "this corresponds to taking @xmath78 .",
    "here we can not find analytic solutions ; we will first consider a series expansion and then find full solutions numerically .",
    "there is a series expansion near @xmath70 which is valid for @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are free data and the first few subleading terms are @xmath83 note that the general series expansion has no @xmath84 term , so it can not match smoothly on to the @xmath85 solution at @xmath86 .",
    "we construct solutions numerically by picking some value @xmath87 at which to take @xmath88 , and integrating inwards towards @xmath70 . near @xmath87",
    "we take an ansatz @xmath89 where @xmath87 is left undetermined by the equation of motion and the first coefficients are given by @xmath90 for @xmath91 , these coefficients agree with @xmath85 .",
    "we find numerically that in the ranges @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath64 has a definite sign , so we can construct the surfaces integrating inwards from @xmath88 .",

    "it was remarked in @xcite that there are no minimal surfaces in ads for @xmath81 approaching @xmath98 from below .",
    "we note that there is a range of @xmath81 values @xmath99 where we find no minimal surfaces , in agreement with the claim of @xcite .",
    "we do not have a physical understanding of the non - existence of surfaces with @xmath97 . in principle , one could attempt to construct them by patching radial integrations from @xmath88 to the vicinity of the singular point @xmath100 and from the singular point towards the boundary .",
    "if they exist , we believe that they would change signature in the bulk , see figure [ fig : l2 f0 free ads ] .",

    "the leading divergence in the action comes from the behaviour near the boundary @xmath70 . for @xmath79",
    "the action simplifies to @xmath109 if we cut off @xmath74 at @xmath110 as before , this now corresponds by to cutting off @xmath111 at @xmath112 , and to obtain a consistent form for @xmath113 .",

    "@xmath114 note that the divergence for these timelike wilson loops is stronger than in the null case . note also that because of the @xmath72 dependence in the cutoff for @xmath111 , the integral over @xmath72 is now finite ; the leading divergence in the action for the timelike case is not concentrated in the vertex of the cusp , but comes from the limit of the range of @xmath23 at every @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the leading divergence for the ads surfaces with @xmath79 is stronger than in the case @xmath65 considered previously . for the surfaces with @xmath115 ,",
    "the action is imaginary , corresponding to an exponential suppression of the amplitude , and the coefficient of this stronger divergence will vanish as we approach the null case . for @xmath116 ,",
    "the action is real because the surface is timelike .",

    "as usual , there will be some additional logarithmic terms arising for specific values such as @xmath15 ; we do not treat these but it should be straightforward to extend our analysis to these cases .    as in ads , we can first consider an asymptotic expansion near the boundary @xmath70 . in this case",
    "we find @xmath118 as @xmath2 , the coefficient of the leading non - trivial term in the series vanishes , and we recover the expansion in the ads case . actually , the limit as @xmath2 of the asymptotic series expansion is somewhat subtle , as there are terms in the expansion with powers which coincide in the limit .",
    "we discuss this limit for the full series expansion in more detail in appendix [ series ] .    from",
    "we see a remarkable feature of the lifshitz minimal surfaces ; the value of @xmath74 ( and hence @xmath23 at fixed @xmath35 ) is initially increasing for any choice of the free parameter @xmath119 .",

    "the equation of motion can then be easily integrated towards @xmath128 . zooming in near the @xmath129 region , we note that @xmath130 changes sign , giving rise to surfaces with a  mushroom \" shape , see figures [ fig : f0 free ] , [ fig : mushroom z=9/8 ] , as expected from the asymptotics .",
    "the behaviour near the boundary is consistent with the asymptotic expansion . in the limit @xmath2 , these solutions approach the timelike surfaces of section [ timel ] with @xmath92 .    on the other hand , for @xmath131 the integration encounters a critical point @xmath132 before reaching @xmath88 , see figure [ fig : hit crit point ] .",
    "we also attempted to find solutions in this regime by a relaxation method , but this also fails to converge . as mentioned in section [ timel ] , one could attempt to construct these solutions by patching two shooting procedures .     and @xmath133 , we plot part of the extremal surface ( solid line ) and @xmath134 in ( dashed line ) .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath64 prevents us from continuing with the shooting from @xmath135 . ]",
    "the divergence of the action is determined by the near boundary expansion ( [ solu1 ] ) .",
    "we are primarily considering the case @xmath136 , where the second @xmath137 term dominates .",
    "if we considered instead @xmath138 , the third @xmath139 term would dominate the near - boundary expansion . in either case , @xmath140 near @xmath70 ,",

    "thus , for @xmath136 , @xmath150 while for @xmath149 , @xmath151 as in the timelike ads case , this divergence is coming from the integral over @xmath23 at all @xmath35 , and there is no additional divergence from the corner contribution at small @xmath72 .",
    "we note that the divergence here is stronger than for the timelike surfaces in ads , but with a coefficient which goes to zero in the limit as @xmath2 , which is consistent with these minimal surfaces reducing to the ones in ads in this limit .",
    "the mushroom feature in the shape of the surface also goes away in this limit , as can be seen from the expansion .",
    "as remarked in the introduction , this stronger divergence in the lifshitz case can be attributed to the presence of the higher density of soft modes implied by the modified dispersion relation @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting that this produces a divergence with a power that is independent of @xmath24 for @xmath136 ; this is consistent with the behaviour of the curvature singularity in the bulk for geodesic probes .",

    "in section [ min ] we presented the leading terms in the asymptotic series around @xmath70 . here",
    "we discuss the full series and its behaviour as @xmath2 .",
    "the general form of solution expansion is conjectured to be @xmath152 where the possible powers appearing in the expansion are @xmath153 and @xmath154 and the first few coefficients are @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158}{2z^{2k}[kz-(k-1)]\\prod_{\\beta=1}^{k}[(2\\beta-1)z-2\\beta ] } \\qquad ( k\\ge 3)\\ ] ] @xmath159    we note that this series expansion is valid for general values of @xmath24 ; there are special rational values where some of the denominators in these expressions for the coefficients vanish . at these values , two of the powers in , which are in general distinct , are coinciding .",
    "there will thus be log terms in the series expansion for these values .",
    "we do not consider them further here .",
    "now consider the limit as @xmath2 .",
    "this limit is clearly very special for the above series expansion , as all the terms in the summations over @xmath160 and @xmath161 will have the same power of @xmath111 in the limit .",
    "we are particularly interested in the leading term at @xmath162 , which would give a leading @xmath163 behaviour for the asymptotic series expansion as @xmath2 . from",
    ", we see that each of these terms vanishes individually as we take the limit , but there are infinitely many of them , so it is not clear what the behaviour of the sum is in this limit .",
    "comparison to the asymptotic series in the ads case would lead us to expect that the coefficient of the @xmath163 term will vanish as we take the limit for our minimal surface solutions with @xmath116 , and that is consistent with our numerical results , but here we want to consider if there is some other way to take the limit that could converge to the solution @xmath68 at @xmath1 , which does have a non - trivial @xmath163 part in its asymptotic expansion .",
    "we therefore consider the limit of assuming @xmath164 as @xmath2 .",
    "let us write @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "we want to calculate @xmath167}{2z^{2k}[kz-(k-1)]\\prod_{\\beta=1}^{k}[(2\\beta-1)z-2\\beta ] } \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\epsilon u_0}{2(1+\\epsilon)^3(1-\\epsilon)}+ \\frac{\\epsilon u_0 ^ 3}{2(1+\\epsilon)^4(1 + 2\\epsilon)(1 - 3\\epsilon)(1-\\epsilon ) } \\\\ & & + \\sum_{k=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\epsilon u_0^{2k-1}\\prod_{\\alpha=3}^{k}[1-(2\\alpha-4)\\epsilon]}{2(1+\\epsilon)^{2k}(1+k\\epsilon)\\prod_{\\beta=1}^k[1-(2\\beta-1)\\epsilon]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can find that @xmath168 where we used ( [ u0 ] ) in the last step .",
    "thus , for @xmath164 , the sum of the series can give a non - zero answer .",
    "note that for @xmath79 the sum is zero , consistent with the expansion in the ads case for @xmath79 . to obtain the @xmath68 solution in the limit , we would need @xmath169 .",
    "thus , if there were solutions with @xmath164 from above in the limit , they could be smoothly connected to the usual ads minimal surface for the lightlike wilson loop . however ,",
    "numerically we have only found solutions for minimal surfaces in lifshitz with @xmath116 . in the @xmath2 limit",
    "these converge to the timelike ads surfaces discussed in section [ timel ] .",
