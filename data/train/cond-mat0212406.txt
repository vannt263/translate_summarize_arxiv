    "in the last two decades huge theoretical efforts were made in order to describe the glass transition on a _ microscopic _ level in systems _ without _ quenched disorder .",
    "microscopic means that , _",
    "e.g. _ , the glass transition temperature and the dynamical properties in its vicinity can be calculated from equations which use as an input the knowledge of the interactions between microscopic constituents of the system ( atoms or molecules ; hereafter we use the term particles ) .",
    "most of this activity has been devoted to _ structural glasses _",
    "although experiments @xcite have demonstrated that plastic crystals can exhibit an _ orientational _ glass transition which has many features in common with the structural glass transition there seems to be no analytical theory for such systems . on the other hand molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations",
    "@xcite have confirmed the similarity between glassy behavior of plastic crystals and that of supercooled liquids .",
    "the first successful microscopic theoretical approach to glassy dynamics in supercooled liquids came from so - called mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite .",
    "this theory was first suggested and mainly worked out in details by gtze and his coworkers . for reviews",
    "the reader may consult refs .",
    "mct derives a closed set of equations for time - dependent correlators , like the intermediate scattering function @xmath21 .",
    "this set uses as an input the corresponding _ static _",
    "correlations , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath22 , which depend only on thermodynamic variables like temperature @xmath23 , density @xmath24 , _ etc . _",
    "the static correlations can be calculated from the microscopic interactions by use of either analytical or numerical tools @xcite . by decreasing @xmath23 ( or increasing @xmath24 ) the peaks of @xmath22",
    "if their magnitude becomes large enough a transition from an ergodic to a non - ergodic phase occurs at a critical temperature @xmath25 ( or density @xmath26 ) .",
    "this _ dynamic _ transition is interpreted as an ideal glass transition .",
    "mct makes several nontrivial predictions for , _",
    "e.g. _ , time dependence of correlators @xcite which have been successfully tested ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the second microscopic theory of the glass transition has been developed by mzard and parisi @xcite .",
    "their first principle theory combines the use of the replica idea known from the spin glass theory and of the liquid state theory techniques .",
    "it is related to an earlier density functional approach @xcite .",
    "mzard and parisi s theory starts from the microscopic hamiltonian for @xmath27 identical replicas of the system to which a symmetry breaking field is added .",
    "the free energy of the replicated system is then calculated and the configurational entropy of the original system is extracted from it . the theory predicts the existence of a critical temperature @xmath28 ( which is below @xmath25 of mct ) at which the configurational entropy vanishes .",
    "this is then interpreted as an ideal _ static _ glass transition .",
    "besides these two microscopic theories , let us mention one other attempt to describe the glass transition that does not resort to microscopic potentials : based on several _ qualitative _ assumptions edwards and vilgis @xcite obtained the dependence of the self - diffusion constant @xmath29 for a system of hard rods on physical control parameter @xmath30 , like , _",
    "e.g. _ , concentration , diameter , or length of the rods .",
    "a dynamical glass transition occurs when @xmath29 becomes zero . a mean field treatment results in @xmath31 and an improved approach leads to the vogel - fulcher law @xmath32 $ ] . close to the critical point",
    "@xmath33 a power law dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath34 is found with a non - trivial exponent @xmath35 .    both above described microscopic theories",
    "have at least one feature in common : non - trivial equilibrium correlations .",
    "these correlations are of primary importance for both theories .",
    "for example , mct requires that the vertices which enter into the self - consistent equations for the correlation functions must depend on at least one control parameter .",
    "recently , it has been shown that a colloidal suspension with hard - core plus attractive yukawa potential can undergo a gel transition @xcite in a special limit : @xmath36 and @xmath37 such that @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is the volume fraction , @xmath40 the interaction strength and @xmath41 a measure of the inverse range of interaction . in",
    "that limit the direct correlation function @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath40 and becomes independent of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the static correlations vanish , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath43 .",
    "but since the vertices are proportional to @xmath39 and involve a bilinear product of @xmath42 they become proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "accordingly , despite the vanishing of the static correlations there is still an ergodicity breaking transition driven by the increase of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "of course , this type of behavior is not generic in the @xmath45 phase space .",
    "in addition , whether the mode coupling approximation remains reasonable must be still checked .",
    "one may now ask the following question : can there be a _",
    "generic _ glass transition if and only if there exist nontrivial static correlations ? to find an answer let us consider a liquid of hard rods .",
    "this system was used as a paradigm in ref .",
    "if the rods thickness @xmath46 is finite the static correlations are non - trivial and a glass transition will be predicted by either theory .",
    "however , in the limit of _ infinitely thin _ hard rods , _",
    "i. e. _ @xmath47 , with _ finite _",
    "length @xmath1 and _ finite _ concentration @xmath48 , the static properties become trivial .",
    "note that in this limit there is no transition to a nematic phase . also , according to either of the two microscopic theories there is no glass transition ! in the case of mct the vertices vanish .",
    "the absence of a glass transition is also consistent with a microscopic theory worked out by one of the authors and his coworkers @xcite .",
    "there , it has been shown that for infinitely thin hard rods with randomly frozen orientations translational diffusion never ceases if the diffusion constant along the rod s direction is nonzero .",
    "now suppose we fix the infinitely thin hard rods with their centers on the sites of a three - dimensional periodic lattice .",
    "such a model has already been suggested earlier @xcite . it can be used to describe the steric hindrance of the orientational degrees of freedom in plastic crystals @xcite .",
    "again , both mct and the replica theory exclude a glass transition , due to the lack of static correlations . the fact that mct in its present form does not predict a glass transition",
    "was already stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , computer simulations @xcite showed glassy behavior and suggested a _",
    "dynamical _ ergodicity - breaking transition at a critical length @xmath49 .",
    "this simple example makes clear that non - trivial static behavior is _ not _ necessary for a glass transition .",
    "it is the main goal of our paper to present a microscopic approach to the glass transition for systems without static correlations .",
    "a short account of our approach for the case of a simple cubic lattice was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will discuss our model and the theoretical framework in more detail and will extend the results to bcc and fcc lattices .",
    "furthermore , we will investigate the type of glass transition and the long time dynamics in its vicinity .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we will present and discuss the model .",
    "the third section contains the analytical theory used to describe the glass transition .",
    "the results are given in the fourth section and the final section includes a summary and some conclusions .",
    "we consider @xmath0 hard , infinitely thin rods ( _ i.e. _ diameter @xmath47 ) with length @xmath1 and with their centers fixed at the lattice sites of a _ periodic _ lattice with lattice constant @xmath2 .",
    "the dimensionless control parameter is the reduced rod length , @xmath50 . in the following",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a simple cubic lattice .",
    "its unit cell is depicted in fig .",
    "all qualitative conclusions which will be drawn in this paper remain valid for _ all _ periodic lattices .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath51 each rod can rotate freely : there is no steric hindrance . for @xmath19 above one , collisions between a rod and adjacent ones appear . if @xmath52 a given rod interacts only with the six nearest neighbors .",
    "further increase of @xmath19 will introduce collisions between next- , third- , fourth- , _ etc .",
    "_ nearest neighbors , generating a strong increase of steric hindrance .",
    "since we have chosen infinitely thin rods there is no equilibrium transition to an orientationally ordered phase .",
    "on the other hand , due to the rise of steric hindrance with @xmath19 we expect an orientational glass transition as detected in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "although steric hindrance already exists for @xmath53 , it seems that no ergodicity - breaking transition can occur for @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider the following simple argument . if @xmath55 then the nearest neighbor rods of a tagged rod ( rod 1 ) can `` overlap '' with , _",
    "e.g. _ , the top of the tagged rod ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . this induces a `` cage '' for the tagged rod .",
    "note that this argument is not rigorous , because for @xmath54 there might exist other configurations similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which could block the tagged rod s rotation .",
    "but the value @xmath56 also plays a role from a different point of view .",
    "consider two neighboring rods with their centers along the @xmath57-axis .",
    "their orientations can be described by @xmath58 and @xmath59 . at a collision",
    "it is either @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a ) or @xmath61 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] b ) , for fixed @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the notation @xmath65 and @xmath66 means that rod @xmath67 is behind and in front of rod @xmath68 , respectively ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "now , it is easy to prove that for _ arbitrary _ @xmath62 and @xmath63 there exists only _",
    "one _ contact ( either at @xmath69 _ or _ at @xmath70 ) for @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a , b ) . in that case",
    "@xmath71 can be varied freely by @xmath72 .",
    "but for @xmath55 there is a finite range for both angles @xmath62 and @xmath63 such that _ two _ contacts ( at @xmath73 _ and _ @xmath74 exist ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] c ) .",
    "therefore the `` phase space '' @xmath75 $ ] for @xmath76 is decomposed into two `` ergodic '' components @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] for @xmath62 and @xmath63 kept fixed .",
    "transitions between both components are forbidden . if the rods were fixed at the lattice sites with one of their end points ( like in ref .",
    "@xcite ) then there is only one contact , for _ all _ @xmath53 .",
    "the condition for a collision can be quantified as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath79 and @xmath80 be the unit vectors along rod @xmath68 and @xmath67 and @xmath81 the vector connecting the center of rod @xmath67 with that of rod @xmath68 ( see fig .",

    "then a collision occurs if :    @xmath86 stands for limit @xmath87 .",
    "simple algebra yields :    @xmath88 / [ 1-(\\mathbf{u}_i \\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{j})^2]\\ ] ]    @xmath89 / [ 1-(\\mathbf{u}_i \\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{j})^2]\\ ] ]    note ( i ) that @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be negative ; in that case the contact points into the direction of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively and ( ii ) that @xmath81 is time - independent and is always equal to a lattice vector @xmath92 .    the configurational part of the partition function is given by    @xmath93    since the hard rod interaction potential @xmath94 vanishes almost everywhere .",
    "the corresponding contribution @xmath95 to the free energy is analytic in temperature @xmath23 and does not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "hence , there is no equilibrium phase transition .",
    "the equilibrium pair distribution function @xmath96 is related to the probability to find a rod at @xmath97 and @xmath98 with orientations @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "it is given by :    @xmath101    where the heaviside functions are nonzero at a collision , which happens if conditions eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) are fulfilled . since a collision is non - generic , @xmath102 for almost all @xmath103 and @xmath100 .",
    "hence there are no static correlations , except on a set of measure zero .",
    "in this section we will describe the dynamics for our model and the approximations leading to a closed set of equations .",
    "we assume that the microscopic @xmath0-rod dynamics of the system is brownian rather than newtonian .",
    "previous studies of systems with nontrivial static correlations indicated that glassy dynamics should not depend on that choice @xcite .",

    "this requires an improvement of our microscopic approach .",
    "it is not obvious whether the approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite which is based on rather qualitative arguments can serve as a guide .",
    "it seems that the `` dynamical cage effect '' leads to a discontinuous variation of the nonergodicity parameter at @xmath13 and is accompanied close to @xmath13 by a two - step relaxation process , as can be seen from the orientational correlator studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "such a two - step relaxation was first predicted by mct @xcite and within this theory it is related to the cage effect .",
    "the present theoretical approach predicts a continuous transition for the glass order parameters @xmath311 .",
    "therefore it does not yield a two - step relaxation .",
    "this fact demands for an improvement of our theory , based on the hierarchy of equations for the @xmath3-rod densities .",
    "but on the other hand it is , of course , a big challenge to extend the present mct such that it includes the _ `` dynamical cage effect '' _ described above and that a discontinuous glass transition occurs .",

    "i.e. _ as a laplace transformed correlator _ at frequency @xmath7 _ ( as found in the present approach ) . for systems with vanishing static correlations , like for our model ,",
    "the vertices would be of purely dynamical nature .",
    "now , increasing @xmath46 to finite values will generate static correlations . for small thickness",
    "the `` dynamical cage '' will be still dominant , but at a crossover value @xmath354 the static cage effect would become comparable with the dynamical one and for @xmath355 it would be the dominant one .",
    "let us come back to the choice of brownian _ vs. _ newtonian dynamics .",

    "this is different from what has been found for liquids with nontrivial static correlations @xcite .",
    "however , the linear dependence of the nonergodicity parameters and of the diffusion constant on @xmath343 , the quadratic dependence of the frequency scale @xmath356 on @xmath343 and the @xmath212 dependence of the correlator at the critical length @xmath13 should be independent of the type of dynamics",
    ".    it would be interesting to re - investigate the lattice model with infinitely thin hard rods by computer simulations . with present computers it should be possible to cover a larger time range and to study the dynamics close to @xmath13 in greater detail .",
    "this would allow to check whether the two scaling laws and other predictions of mct are consistent with simulations .",
    "if the outcome of such a test proves consistency it would encourage theoretical efforts to extend the microscopic theory within the framework of mct .    besides rods on a lattice one could also investigate liquid systems of `` particles '' built by crossing infinitely thin hard rods .",
    "if the number of `` legs '' ( rods ) of a `` particle '' becomes large they may exhibit quite similar dynamical behavior to hard spheres , although there are no static correlations .",
    "the time scale on which these `` particles '' realize that they are not hard spheres could be much larger than a typical time scale for structural relaxation .    to conclude",
