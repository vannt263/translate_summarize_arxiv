    "we let @xmath0 be one - dimensional diffusion and denote by @xmath1 the reflected process , @xmath2 where @xmath3 } x_u\\vee s$ ] with @xmath4 .",

    "the rigorous mathematical definition of this problem is presented in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "this setup means that while @xmath5 grows and keeps attaining new maxima , the absorbing boundary is accompanying with @xmath6 . in this paper",
    ", we shall solve for optimal strategy and corresponding value function explicitly along with optimal stopping region in the @xmath14-plane .",
    "the existence of the absorbing state makes the stopping region more complex .",
    "the idea is the following : we look at excursions that occur from each level of @xmath6 , and reduce the problem to an infinite number of one - dimensional optimal stopping problems . for finding the explicit form of the value function",
    ", we employ the theory of excursion of lvy processes , in particular the characteristic measure that is related to the height of excursions .",
    "( refer to bertoin @xcite as a general reference . )",
    "since the diffusion @xmath5 is not in general of independent increments , we use the measure change to make the diffusion behave like a brownian motion under the new measure .",
    "having done that , we solve , at each level of @xmath6 , one - dimensional optimal stopping problems by using the excessive characterization of the value function .",
    "this corresponds to the concavity of the value function after certain transformation .",
    "see dynkin@xcite , alvarz@xcite and dayanik and karatzas @xcite .",
    "note that for the excursion theory for spectrally negative lvy processes ( that have only downward jumps ) , see also avram et al .",

    "stopping that involve both @xmath6 and @xmath5 , we mention a pioneering work of peskir@xcite .",
    "there are also ott @xcite and guo and zervos @xcite . in the former paper",
    ", the author solves problems including a capped version of the shepp - shiryaev problem @xcite and the latter makes another contribution that extends @xcite .",
    "a recent development in this area includes alvarez and matoki @xcite where a discretized approach is taken to find optimal solutions and a numerical algorithm is presented .",
    "our contributions in this paper may advance the literature in several respects : we do not assume any specific forms or properties in the reward functions and we provide _ explicit _ forms of the value function _ with or without the absorbing boundary _ and illustrate the procedure of the solution method .",
    "hence we present a very general solution method in a general setting .    the existence of the absorbing state that varies with the maximum process leads to various applications . in this paper",
    ", we provide a new problem where an investor puts her money in risky assets and she maintains the following investment policy : if the drawdown of the asset value exceeds certain level , say a fraction of the running maximum , she would sell all her risky assets and put the proceeds to risk - free assets .",
    "this investment policy is due to avoid the liquidity problem that prevailed in the years of the financial crisis .",
    "that is , when asset markets deteriorate , some investors are forced to sell their assets further since they need cash to repay their debt .",
    "that would lead to vicious circle : further price depreciations and depletion of liquidity .",
    "hence her problem is to set up a rule as to when she converts her risky assets to risk - free .",
    "other applications to real - life problems include bank s failures during the financial crisis .",
    "these banks had maintained high leverage and accordingly , they were , despite their large size , not so safe since the bankruptcy threshold ( = absorption state ) keeps up with the size of the banks .",
    "egami and oryu @xcite @xcite modeled this phenomenon by using spectrally negative lvy processes for the bank s asset size @xmath5 .",
    "further applications are possible : one can add barriers that would nullify the value of lookback options ( with the terminal payoff @xmath15 for instance ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we formulate a mathematical model with a review of some important facts of linear diffusions , and then find an optimal solution in section [ sec : solution ] . finally in section 4 , we shall demonstrate the solution methodology using an example of the investment problem in risky assets , providing an explicit calculation .",
