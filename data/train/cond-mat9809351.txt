    "in colloidal suspensions the interaction between the mesoscopic dissolved particles and the solvent is of basic importance @xcite .",
    "for example , the solvent generates effective interactions between the colloidal particles which can even lead to flocculation .",
    "the richness of the physical properties of these systems is mainly based on the possibility to tune these effective interactions over wide ranges of strength and form of the interaction potential .",
    "traditionally this tuning is accomplished by changing the chemical composition of the solvent , e.g. , by adding salt , polymers , or other components @xcite .",
    "compared with such modifications , changes of the temperature or pressure typically result only in minor changes of the effective interactions .",
    "this , however , is only true as long as the solvent is not thermodynamically close to a phase transition of its own .",
    "for example , if the solvent consists of a binary liquid mixture close to a _ first - order _ demixing transition into a a - rich and a b - rich liquid phase , even slight changes of the temperature or of the partial pressures of the two species a and b can lead to massive changes of the effective interactions between dissolved colloid particles induced by the occurrence of wetting transitions .",
    "they lead to wetting films of the preferred phase coating the colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "these wetting films can snap into bridges if the particles come close to each other leading to flocculation @xcite . for",
    "charged colloidal particles such as silica spheres immersed in the binary liquid mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine @xcite flocculation can also be influenced by screening effects generated by the adsorbed layers @xcite .",
    "similarly drastic effects can occur if the solvent is brought close to a _",
    "critical point_. the inevitable preference of the surfaces of the colloidal particles for one of the two solvent species of a binary liquid mixture near its critical demixing point or for the liquid phase of a one- or two - component solvent fluid near its liquid - vapor critical point results into the presence of effective surface fields leading to pronounced adsorption profiles of the preferred component .",
    "this so - called ` critical adsorption ' becomes particularly long - ranged due to the correlation effects induced by the critical fluctuations of the order parameter of the solvent . in the case of a planar wall critical adsorption",
    "has been studied in much detail @xcite .",
    "asymptotically close to the critical point @xmath0 it is characterized by a surface field which is infinitely large so that the order parameter profile actually diverges upon approaching the wall up to atomic distances @xmath1 . as compared to a planar surface critical adsorption on a spherical particle",
    "is expected to exhibit important differences in behavior because the confining surface has a positive curvature and because a sphere represents only a quasi - zero - dimensional defect floating in the critical fluid .",
    "the interference of critical adsorption on neighboring spheres gives rise to the so - called critical casimir forces @xcite which have been argued to contribute to the occurrence of flocculation near @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a quantitative understanding of these phenomena requires the knowledge of the critical adsorption profiles near the colloidal particles and the resulting effective free energy of interaction in the whole vicinity of the critical point , i.e. , as function of both the reduced temperature @xmath2 and the field @xmath3 conjugate to the order parameter .",
    "this ambitious goal has not yet been accomplished . instead",
    ", the introduction of a surface curvature has limited the knowledge of the corresponding critical adsorption so far to the case of spheres for the particular thermodynamic state @xmath4 of the solvent @xcite .",
    "only recently at least the temperature dependence of the critical casimir force between a sphere and a planar container wall has been addressed @xcite .",
    "thus the present study of the temperature dependence of critical adsorption on a single sphere contributes one step towards reaching the aforementioned general goal .",
    "apart from spherical particles , also rodlike particles play an important role @xcite .",
    "rodlike objects are provided , e.g. , by fibers or colloidal rods @xcite , semiflexible polymers with a large persistence length such as actin @xcite , microtubuli @xcite , and carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "moreover the knowledge of the general curvature dependence of critical adsorption is also relevant , e.g. , for curved membranes @xcite dissolved in a fluid near criticality or for the liquid - vapor interface between a binary liquid mixture near its critical demixing point and its noncritical vapor , which exhibits rippled configurations due to the occurrence of capillary waves @xcite .",
    "near criticality the relevant length scales of the solvent structures are dominated by the diverging bulk correlation length @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the standard universal bulk critical exponent ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are nonuniversal amplitudes in the one- ( @xmath9 ) and two - phase region ( @xmath10 ) , respectively , with values typically in the order of a few  . in practice",
    "the correlation length can span the range between @xmath11 - @xmath12 depending on @xmath13 .",
    "in the present context this length scale is played off against the length scale @xmath14 of the radius of the dissolved particles .",
    "we note that the available systems can realize both the limit @xmath15 as well as the opposite limit @xmath16 . in the case of ludox silica particles",
    "@xmath17 @xcite so that the limit @xmath16 can be easily achieved even with the upper limits for @xmath18 set by finite experimental resolutions .",
    "the ratio of the length @xmath19 and the radius @xmath14 of rodlike particles can be quite large , in conjunction with a small radius such as @xmath20 in the case of colloidal boehmite rods @xcite . in this work we consider _ long _ rods , i.e. , @xmath21 , and neglect effects which may arise due to their finite length @xmath19 .",

    "the reason is that eq.([b60a ] ) is linear with respect to @xmath415 so that eq.([b60 ] ) is solved by the ansatz @xmath416 where @xmath417 is independent of @xmath33 and satisfies the inhomogeneous linear differential equation        \\(ii ) function @xmath410 . by using eq.([b110 ] ) the differential equation ( [ b70a ] ) turns into @xmath421 with @xmath417 from eq.([b130 ] ) . in this case both on the rhs of eq.([b140 ] ) and in the boundary condition in the first part of eq.([b70b ] ) different dependences on @xmath33 arise via the terms @xmath422 and @xmath414 .",
    "again it is crucial to observe that eq.([b140 ] ) is linear with respect to @xmath423 so that its dependence on @xmath33 takes the simple form @xmath424 where @xmath425 and @xmath426 are independent of @xmath33 and satisfy separately the inhomogeneous linear differential equations      [ b170 ] @xmath429 @xmath430 equations ( [ b160 ] ) and ( [ b170 ] ) can be solved numerically , which is facilitated by the fact that both @xmath417 and @xmath402 on the rhs of eqs.([b160a ] ) and ( [ b170a ] ) are known in analytical form . by inserting the resulting function @xmath410 from eq.([b150 ] ) and the function @xmath409 from eq.([b110 ] ) into eqs.([b90 ] ) and ( [ b100 ] ) one obtains the dependences of @xmath431 and @xmath432 on @xmath33 as given by eq.([e125 ] ) with the curvature parameters given in the first parts of eq.([q20 ] ) .",
    "the procedure in the case @xmath147 is completely analogous to that for @xmath258 as outlined above and yields the curvature parameters in the second parts of eq.([q20 ] ) .                                      for the case of parallel plates",

    "this leads to a corresponding change of the scaling functions @xmath43 and of quantities obtained from them so that experimentally observable quantities remain unchanged ( for more details see appendix [ app_neu ] and ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the bars on @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 serve to distinguish these coefficients from the corresponding ones @xmath435 , @xmath436 , @xmath437 introduced in ref.@xcite which are defined differently from eq.([a40 ] ) .      the first singular contribution proportional to @xmath63 in eq.([a40 ] ) can be attributed @xcite to the leading nontrivial ` surface operator ' @xmath438 with the stress tensor operator @xmath439 whose ` scaling dimension ' is equal to the spatial dimension @xmath24 .",
    "we briefly outline the argument : since the curvature contributions must depend on how the surface is embedded in the space @xmath440 they must be derivable from the local extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath441 where @xmath442 is the local unit vector normal to the surface ( we only consider orientable surfaces ) .",
    "the principal local radii of curvature @xmath443 are the inverse of the @xmath444 eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath445 .",
    "therefore @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and @xmath245 as defined in eq.([a100 ] ) are the only independent scalar quantities to first and second order in @xmath446 which can be deduced from @xmath447 and which are invariant under permutations of the indices @xmath448 .",
    "the leading regular term captured by the ellipses in eq.([a150 ] ) which is analytic in @xmath449 is proportional to @xmath450 . since all terms in curly brackets depend only on the dimensionless variables @xmath54 and @xmath101 this regular term must scale with @xmath451 where the exponent is larger than two if @xmath452 .",
    "it is instructive to interpret eq.([m40 ] ) as an equation of motion of a particle at ` position ' @xmath456 and ` time ' @xmath192 subjected to the ` potential energy ' @xmath457 @xcite . in general the differential equation",
    "can not be solved analytically due to the time - dependent friction term .",
