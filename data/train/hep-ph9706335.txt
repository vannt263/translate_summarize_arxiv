    "the production of intermediate mass higgs bosons at hadron colliders arises primarily from the gluon fusion process @xmath9 , which is dominated by the top quark loop @xcite . depending on the collider energy",
    ", there can also be a substantial contribution from the gauge boson fusion processes @xmath10 @xcite . for higgs boson masses",
    "@xmath6 less than @xmath11 , detection of the higgs via its dominant decay mode @xmath12 must contend with a large background from @xmath13 .",
    "the production of higgs bosons in association with a gauge boson , specifically @xmath14 @xcite or a photon @xcite , is potentially helpful in dealing with these backgrounds , although at a significant cost in the rate .    in this report",
    ", we examine the possibility of using higgs - photon associated production in hadron collisions as a means of studying properties of the higgs boson .",
    "the main source of the @xmath15 final state is quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "two - gluon annihilation , which accounts for single @xmath16 production , is forbidden by furry s theorem because the gluons are in a color singlet state . for light quarks ,",
    "the direct annihilation into @xmath15 is suppressed by the ratio @xmath17 and is negligible .",
    "this means that one - loop electroweak corrections involving @xmath18 s , @xmath19 s and top quarks dominate the light quark contribution to @xmath20 .",
    "the diagrams involved in the one - loop quark - antiquark annihilation calculation are similar to those encountered in the calculation of @xmath21 , which has been performed for the standard model @xcite and its supersymmetric generalization @xcite . as in the case of @xmath22 @xcite , there are also tree - level contributions from @xmath23 and @xmath24 annihilation , which are enhanced by their larger couplings but suppressed by parton distribution function effects .    in the next section ,",
    "we outline the extension of our previous tree @xcite and one - loop results @xcite to @xmath2 .",
    "this is followed by a discussion .",
    "the tree - level diagrams are illustrated in fig.1 and the resulting amplitude is @xmath25\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the momentum of the quark , @xmath27 the momentum of the antiquark , @xmath28 the momentum of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 its polarization and @xmath31 is the quark charge in units of the proton charge . for massless quarks , only the helicity non - flip contributions from the factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 are non - zero .",
    "thus , we expect the helicity flip tree amplitudes to contain a factor of order @xmath34 relative to the non - flip amplitudes . explicitly , we find , @xmath35 & , & \\lambda_1\\lambda_2 = + + \\\\",

    "it can be seen that the helicity flip amplitudes have an additional factor of @xmath41 .",
    "the one - loop amplitudes for @xmath42 receive contributions from pole diagrams involving virtual photon and @xmath19 exchange and from various box diagrams containing quarks , gauge bosons and/or goldstone bosons .",
    "there are also double pole diagrams whose contribution vanishes .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "the main difference between @xmath43 annihilation and @xmath44 annihilation occurs in the crossed box diagram in the last row of fig.1 .",
    "since both members of a quark doublet are charged , there are additional crossed box diagrams containing @xmath18 s",
    ". this contribution can be obtained from our @xmath19 box results by merely changing the coupling and replacing @xmath45 by @xmath46 .    in the non - linear gauges we chose @xcite ,",

    "this can be seen by noting that , in the center of mass , we have    [ loopamp ] @xmath61    with @xmath62 . if we define @xmath63 as @xmath64 then @xmath63 is predominantly helicity flip .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath65 is @xmath66 where the invariant amplitude @xmath67 . because of the helicity structure discussed above",
    ", the interference terms turn out to be negligible and one can simply add the tree and one - loop cross sections .    to obtain the collider cross sections , we convolute eq.([dsig ] ) with the appropriate quark and antiquark distribution functions using @xmath68 here , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are determined by the choice of the rapidity and transverse momentum cuts .",
    "we used cteq3 - 1 m parton distribution functions @xcite and imposed a rapidity cut of 2.5 and a transverse momentum cut of 10 gev on both the higgs boson and the photon .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath73 is illustrated in fig.2 for an upgraded tevatron energy of 2.0 tev ( left panel ) and an lhc energy of 14 tev ( right panel ) . in each case",
    ", we show the tree contributions from light quarks ( @xmath74 ) , light quarks plus the @xmath3 quark and light quarks plus @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks .",
    "in addition , the loop contribution from the light quarks is shown .",
    "the loop contributions from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks are negligible .",
    "as asserted in the introduction , fig.2 confirms that the light quark tree contribution can always be neglected .",
    "interestingly , the largest tree contribution is due to the @xmath3 quark for both the tevatron and the lhc , and the @xmath4 quark contribution is always important . at the tevatron energy ,",
    "the loop diagrams contribute about as much as the tree diagrams , while , for the lhc , the tree diagrams dominate .    in our calculation of the heavy quark tree contributions , we simply convoluted the cross section for @xmath75 with the complete heavy parton distribution functions @xcite , instead of subtracting from them the lowest order logarithmic correction to avoid potential double counting of higher order gluonic contributions @xcite . based on an earlier study of higgs boson production at the ssc @xcite ,",
    "this procedure is likely to somewhat overestimate the heavy quark fusion contribution .",
    "the effects of qcd corrections have not been considered , although some of these , in particular the @xmath76 factor , usually increase the heavy quark cross sections @xcite .",
    "we have not included top quark fusion in our results since the top quark is almost certainly too massive to be treated as a parton at lhc energies .",
    "although there are non - negligible numbers of events for a tevatron with an upgraded luminosity of 20 - 30fb@xmath77/year @xcite or the lhc with a design luminosity of 100fb@xmath77/year , the background to the signal @xmath78 must be considered . to do this , we have calculated the direct production of the @xmath79 final state arising from the channels @xmath80 @xcite and @xmath81 . in table",
    "i , the background contributions are shown for cuts on the @xmath24 invariant mass @xmath82 in the vicinity of @xmath83gev and 200 gev and rapidity cuts @xmath84 and 2.5 on the @xmath4 , @xmath85 and @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to these cuts , we require the separation @xmath86 between the @xmath29 and the @xmath4 and the @xmath29 and the @xmath85 to be greater than 0.4 , the transverse momenta of the @xmath4 , @xmath85 and @xmath29 to be greater than 15 gev , and the @xmath79 invariant mass to be greater than 170 gev .",
    "the latter two cuts reduce the background in the @xmath6 = 100 gev region by about a factor of 5 .",
    "they reduce the loop signal by about 40% at @xmath87 = 1.8 tev and 14 tev , but the corresponding reduction in the tree contribution is a factor of 15 at 1.8 tev and a factor of 6.8 at 14 tev . thus the tree contribution , though substantial , is difficult to isolate .",
    "the background is compared to the signal in table ii for higgs boson masses of 100 gev and 200 gev . despite the application of numerous cuts",
    ", it appears that the background is prohibitively large for the observation of a higgs boson with standard model couplings produced in association with a photon .    finally , to determine the sensitivity of associated production to changes in the @xmath88 coupling , we computed the cross section including a factor @xmath89 multiplying the standard model coupling @xcite . for a 2 tev tevatron upgrade ,",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig.3 as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "the most obvious effect is the uniform decrease in the cross section as @xmath89 varies from @xmath90 to the standard model value at @xmath91 . with increasing @xmath89",
    ", the cross sections eventually exceed the standard model result .",
    "the enhancement in the cross section for larger values of @xmath89 is still not sufficient to produce favorable @xmath92 value .",
    "for example , for @xmath93 and @xmath94 gev , the cuts used for table ii give @xmath95 .",
    "it is clear that any anomalous @xmath15 coupling must result in a cross section of several femtobarns and a fairly isotropic angular distribution in order to produce a signal that will survive the cuts required to reduce the @xmath79 background .",
