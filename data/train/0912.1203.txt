    "the positron excess in galactic cosmic ray positrons between 1 and @xmath2 gev , despite a history of conflicting results , appears to be confirmed by pamela @xcite .",
    "there are , of course , several possible astrophysical explanations .",
    "nearby sources ( e.g. supernova or pulsars ) of positrons , for example , which suffer fewer losses than typical galactic positrons because they are younger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contribute harder spectra .",
    "nevertheless , dark matter annihilation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or decay @xcite have long been suggested as a possible source .",
    "annihilation , however , encounters a number of difficulties , as it requires a substantial boosting either from clumping ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or from a sommerfeld enhancement @xcite , and would lead to intense photon emission from the galactic - center region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or extragalactic background radiation from the superposition of haloes @xcite , that appears to exceed current observational limits .    here",
    "we investigate dark - matter decay as the source of the excess positrons observed with pamela .",
    "our purpose is not a comprehensive theory of the dark - matter decay , in particular not the viability of leptophilic decay , which is one of the challenges @xcite , given that standard hadronization scenarios are already excluded by the lack of an excess in the cosmic - ray antiproton data @xcite .",
    "the decay source function scales with the dark - matter density , not the density squared as does annihilation , and therefore the limits on decaying dark matter from observations of high - energy @xmath0 rays from , e.g. , dwarf galaxies are weak @xcite , but diffuse emission may provide more stringent constraints @xcite . we calculate the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission of the excess leptons , presuming they arise from dark - matter decay .",
    "the @xmath0-ray intensity thus derived is more model - independent and also a lower limit to the true emission level , because we do not count @xmath0 rays that are directly produced in the dark - matter decay , possibly via other unstable particles .",
    "the propagation length of positrons and electrons at energies @xmath3  gev is @xmath4  pc @xcite , considerably less than the scalelength of the dark - matter halo in the galaxy , i.e. the source distribution of positrons and electrons from dark - matter decay . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the energy - dependent diffusion coefficient and @xmath6 is the electron / positron energy - loss timescale . to first order , the spatial redistribution of those electrons by diffusive and convective transport can therefore be neglected .",
    "the differential number density of positrons has , in good approximation , the same spatial profile as the dark - matter density , @xmath7 , because in decay processes the positron source function obeys @xmath8 . the differential number density of electrons / positrons in the steady state is then given by @xmath9 above 10 gev electron energy , the electron energy - loss rate , @xmath10 , is dominated by synchrotron and inverse compton losses .",
    "the soft - photon density varies somewhat between the galactic plane and the halo , reaching a maximum of 1.5  ev/@xmath11 about 300 pc above the midplane and falling to 0.8  ev/@xmath11 at 5 kpc above the midplane @xcite . here",
    "we use an average value @xmath12 to calculate the energy losses .",
    "the magnetic - field strength is not well known , and , using a canonical constant value for it , @xmath13 , we find for the energy - loss rate @xmath14 where we ignore the weak modifications arising from the klein - nishina corrections to the inverse - compton scattering rate .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 permits a scaling of the energy - loss rate relative to that given by the model for the galactic radiation field and a magnetic - field strength @xmath16 . @xmath17",
    "the microwave background implies a lower limit @xmath18 , and a magnetic - field strength @xmath19 would be described by @xmath20 .",
    "estimates of the galactic magnetic field based on modeling the radio synchrotron emission give amplitudes from @xmath21 @xcite to @xmath22 @xcite , and the most likely value for @xmath15 is therefore in the range @xmath23 .",
    "the differential number density of electrons / positrons can not have a spectrum harder than @xmath24 , which is the spectrum that comes from the hardest possible injection spectrum .    the pamela collaboration has measured a positron fraction that is rapidly increasing above 10  gev . the highest - energy data point is @xmath25 about 90% of which is in excess to the positrons expected from secondary production in cosmic - ray interactions .",
    "the total electron spectrum has not been determined with pamela yet , but we may use the excellent fermi - lat data that between 20  gev and 1  tev are well represented by a single power law @xcite @xmath26 combining eqs .",
    "[ eq3 ] and [ eq4 ] we find the positron density at 82 gev as @xmath27 the positron excess over ordinary secondary production is measured to be only about 0.03 at 17  gev , thus indicating that the excess component has a spectrum not significantly softer than @xmath24 .",
    "equation  [ eq1 ] indicates that this requires the injection of electron and positrons with a typical energy above 80 gev . for simplicity",
    "we assume the injection of monoenergetic electrons , @xmath28 where @xmath29  gev to avoid a spectral feature in the total electron spectrum , which would be in conflict with the power - law fit to the fermi data .",
    "we shall see that the @xmath0-ray limits calculated below provide much tighter constraints on @xmath30 .",
    "assuming an equal number of excess electrons and positrons , we therefore estimate the total differential density of electrons / positrons that may come from dark - matter decay as @xmath31     ( dotted line ) , and the total calculated positron fraction ( solid line ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show the positron fraction for a flat injection spectrum up to 200  gev ( dot - dashed line ) and the total positron fraction for that case ( triple - dot - dashed line).,width=288 ]    in figure  [ fig2 ] we demonstrate that the sum of this modeled dark - matter decay component and the expected contribution of secondary positron production provides a good fit to the pamela data .",
    "for comparison , the figure also displays the positron fraction for the case of a flat injection spectrum , which may result from the decay of an intermediate particle with high kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 here @xmath34 is chosen 20% larger than in the case of monoenergetic injection to improve the fit of the positron fraction . to be noted from the figure",
    "is that @xmath35 is needed for flat injection to well reproduce the positron fraction measured with pamela .",
    "@xmath36 denotes the spatial distribution normalized to the local density , which should reflect that of the dark - matter particles .",
    "simulations suggest that the dark - matter halo in the galaxy is not spherical , and the vertical scale height may be only 40% of that in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the tidal streams produced by the sagittarius dwarf speroidal may even indicate a triaxial density distribution @xcite . here",
    "we conservatively assume a dark - matter halo with vertical flattening and for simplicity a global @xmath37 density scaling instead of , e.g. , a nfw halo @xcite . in that approximation ,",
    "the normalized density profile at the solar circle ( @xmath38  kpc ) is @xmath39      using eqs .",
    "[ eq1 ] , [ eq2 ] , and [ eq6 ] we can estimate the source function of pairs from dark matter , and hence the dark - matter decay timescale . assuming for simplicity decay into monoenergetic pairs , we find from equations [ eq1 ] and [ eq - inj ] @xmath40 the source power is @xmath41 comparing with the local dark - matter mass density , @xmath42 , and accounting for an arbitrary branching ratio of conversion into pairs , @xmath43 , we find for the dark - matter decay time @xmath44 care must be exercised in comparing astrophysical limits on the decay time on account of its dependence on the energy of the injected pairs and on the assumed magnetic - field strength .",
    "for example , @xcite use @xmath45 , implying @xmath46 , and consequently their limits on @xmath47 are relatively high .",
    "the electrons and positrons in the halo will inverse - compton scatter soft photons into the @xmath0-ray band where they can be observed with , e.g. , the fermi - lat detector .",
    "the target photon field includes the microwave background , galactic infrared emission , and galactic optical emission , only the first of which is isotropic .",
    "the latter two will be backscattered toward the galaxy , thus somewhat increasing the scattering rate compared with the isotropic case .",
    "the radiation field has been recently modeled out to @xmath48  kpc @xcite . surprisingly , the energy density of optical light is higher in the halo than in the midplane on account of the thin - disk distribution of absorbers .",
    "the differential cross section for the up - scattering of isotropic photons of energy @xmath49 to energy @xmath50 is given by @xcite @xmath51 \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 the @xmath0-ray intensity observed from the galactic pole is then computed using the differential density of electrons / positrons ( eq .  [ eq6 ] ) and the differential density of soft photons , @xmath53 @xcite . @xmath54",
    "the resulting intensity is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . to be noted from the figure is that even at 30 gev , where the emission arises from upscattering optical photons , the expected intensity is below 20% of the preliminary estimate of the extragalactic isotropic background observed with fermi @xcite , in line with the findings of @xcite .",
    "diffuse galactic emission from cosmic - ray interaction has an intensity similar to that of the extragalactic isotropic background , and hence dark - matter decay is poorly constrained by @xmath0-ray emission in the galaxy .    whereas no significant intensity above 1 gev is expected to come from beyond a distance of 5 kpc , the limit to which we have integrated the galactic emission ,",
    "this is not true for the upscattering of microwave - background photons into the 100-mev band .",
    "in fact , in the outer halo inverse - compton scattering of the microwave background accounts for a larger share of the electron energy losses than near the galactic plane , because the infrared and optical photon fields quickly lose intensity beyond 5 kpc above the plane of the galaxy .",
    "also , the magnetic - field strength is expected to fall off , although we do not know at what point it drops to 3@xmath55 , below which the synchrotron energy losses are subdominant . we will estimate the intensity in the 100-mev band from galactic dark - matter decay in the outer halo in the next section , together with the extragalactic component .",
    "the majority of dark matter is located sufficiently far away from galaxies ( @xmath56  kpc ) that positrons and electrons from its decay would primarily interact with the microwave background .",
    "since all electrons suffer the same fate and the electron source rate scales linearly with the dark - matter density , we can ignore any density structure and use spatially averaged quantities , i.e. a conservative fraction 90% of @xmath57 times the critical density , @xmath58 .",
    "for the source function and the energy - loss rate we find @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the redshift .",
    "the average differential number density is therefore @xmath62 the intensity of inverse - compton emission is calculated as @xmath63 \\label{eq14}\\ ] ] where @xmath64^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\label{eq15}\\ ] ] is the jacobian used to turn the line - of - sight integral into a redshift integral .",
    "we integrate to redshift @xmath48 , beyond which the emissivity is negligibly small .",
    "the soft - photon distribution is the cosmological microwave background @xmath65 with @xmath66  ev , added to which is a small contribution in the infrared band @xcite .",
    "the resulting expected @xmath0-ray intensity is plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] for @xmath67 , together with that produced in the outer parts of the milky - way halo at height @xmath68  kpc where ic scattering off the cmb is also dominant and the expected differential density of electrons and positrons from dark - matter decay is @xmath69 larger than the galactic - plane solution ( eq .  [ eq6 ] ) by the ratio of the energy - loss lifetime in the outer halo to that in the galactic plane .",
    "if the excess electrons and positrons could freely stream in the outer halo , we would be overestimating their @xmath0-ray emission which contributes at most 1/3 of the total dark - matter signal .",
    "however , a number of well - known plasma instabilities would sharply impede such free streaming . as a 100-gev electron has a propagation length of only @xmath115  kpc even if the diffusion coefficient is a 100 times that in the galactic plane , the effect of particle propagation is neglected in deriving eq .",
    "[ eq6neu ] .    at 200  mev",
    "@xmath0-ray energy , the predicted intensity is close to that observed with fermi @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the measured intensity is typically 15% and predominantly systematic in origin .",
    "because the electron / positron density is linear in @xmath15 , the predicted @xmath0-ray intensity would exceed the observational limits if the total magnetic - field in the solar vicinity were stronger than @xmath70 .",
    "it would also exceed the observational limits if the characteristic energy of the injected pairs were higher than @xmath1250  gev .",
    "for comparison , figure  [ fig1 ] also shows the expected intensity for @xmath71 to be twice that observed at 200  mev @xmath0-ray energy .    the same scaling with energy @xmath30 results for flat injection ( cf .",
    "[ eq - inj - alt ] and [ eq6alt ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray peak will appear at slightly lower energy and with somewhat reduced flux compared with monoenergetic injection at the same @xmath30 , because the mean particle energy is @xmath72 .",
    "this is demonstrated as well in figure  [ fig1 ] where we show the expected @xmath0-ray bump resulting from flat injection up to 300  gev , i.e. with characteristic energy @xmath1  150  gev .",
    "-ray intensity observed from the galactic poles with the preliminary estimate of the extragalactic isotropic background observed with fermi , indicated by the dashed line @xcite , and older data from comptel @xcite and egret @xcite .",

    "we have investigated @xmath0-ray constraints on the notion that dark - matter decay is responsible for the recently measured excess of cosmic - ray positrons in the 1100 gev band . while the predicted gev - band intensity from the inverse - compton scattering of infrared and optical photons is below a preliminary estimate of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background based on fermi data @xcite , the _ extragalactic _",
    "background from the decay of intergalactic dark matter would produce a bump at 100300 mev that is close to the observed extragalactic background at these energies , even one estimated from the older egret data @xcite .",
    "dark - matter decay therefore does not seem to be a viable explanation of the positron excess , unless the characteristic energy of the pairs produced in dark - matter decay is only in a narrow window between the lower limit @xmath76 imposed by high - energy limit of the pamela measurement and the high energy limit of @xmath77 gev imposed by the extragalactic 100 to 200 mev @xmath0-ray background .",
    "our stated limits are conservative in several ways : a ) any @xmath0 rays directly produced in the decay of the dark - matter particles will lead to an additional signal that will make the observational limits more severe .",
    "b ) we have neglected the contribution of astrophysical sources that are needed to explain the _ shape _ of the observed @xmath0 ray spectrum , which is far broader than the dark - matter contribution .",
    "any dark matter contribution would probably be noticeable at the 30 percent level .",
    "c ) any real decay process may involve multi - generational pairs , such as decay into electron positron pairs via taus and muons , even if quarks are avoided by some leptophilic process .",
    "this makes it harder to fit the pairs into the allowed energy window .",
    "we stress that the predicted 100 - 200 mev @xmath0-ray intensity from dark - matter decay is nearly model - independent , because it depends only on the total dark - matter density in regions outside those of strong galactic magnetic fields and starlight , i.e. in regions where inverse - compton scattering of microwave background photons is a calorimeter for intergalactic electrons and positrons on account of its dominance among the energy - loss processes .",
    "the only assumptions we have made are time - independence of the dark - matter lifetime , which follows from conventional elementary particle physics , and the best estimates for the average magnetic field of the galaxy in the solar neighborhood .    moreover , because the anomalous positrons reported by pamela are too energetic to retain their energy for a hubble time , the only way to prevent the energy from going into @xmath0 rays is to preempt the inverse compton losses with even faster synchrotron losses .",
    "it would seem then that magnetic fields of strength @xmath78 are the only way to preempt ic losses",
    ".    the argument would then apply to positrons from clump - enhanced dark matter annihilation as well as decay , if such enhancement occurred a ) mostly in the outer part of galaxies where the magnetic field and starlight are weak , b ) in extragalactic dark matter clumps or dwarf galaxies , where the magnetic field is weaker that in our own galaxy or c ) elliptical galaxies , where the magnetic field strengths are likely to be less than in our own galaxy . quantifying this constraint for annihilating dark matter",
    "requires a reliable computation of the distribution of annihilation , which is limited by numerical resolution at small mass scales .",
    "@xcite argue that the positron emissivity per unit mass ( q ) in the outer halo , @xmath79 , exceeds that in the local galactic neighborhood , @xmath80 , because substructure survives tidal destruction far better there",
    ". this would raise the @xmath0 ray contribution in the outer halo by a factor of @xmath81 relative to the limits we derive for decaying dark matter , where @xmath82 everywhere .",
    "extragalactic substructure may give an even higher @xmath83 , because there is less tidal destruction , though there is the competing effect that in regions of lower density fluctuation , substructure is less likely to form at high redshift .",
    "sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross section at low center - of - mass energy would further raise the contribution of low mass substructures , in which the center - of - mass kinetic energy of the annihilating pairs would be lower than in the diffuse dark matter in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "thus , if we could make reliable simulations of dark - matter substructure down to the smallest mass scales for all cosmic locations , the results would probably already rule out explaining the pamela positron excess by annihilating dark matter .",
    "the arguments here do not , of course , immediately rule out detection of decay or annihilating dark matter by other more sensitive means , e.g. @xmath0 rays from localized dm concentrations .",
    "they merely argue against most scenarios for explaining the pamela positron anomaly in this manner . however , they call attention to the fact that any scenario for making @xmath0 rays that includes accompanying e+ e- pairs , e.g. @xmath0 rays by pion decay or final state radiation , may be constrained by the inverse compton @xmath0 rays that would accompany the direct @xmath0 rays emitted in regions of weak magnetic field .",
    "conversely , annihilation or decay that produces more pairs than direct @xmath0 rays may be more readily detected via inverse compton radiation of the pairs .",
