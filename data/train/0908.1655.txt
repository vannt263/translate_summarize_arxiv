    "modern theoretical models of the infrared emission from dust in the diffuse ism require a large proportion of starlight energy to be reradiated by ultrasmall grains ( @xmath720% ; draine 2003 ) .",
    "comparison of the observed spectra with theory suggests that a large fraction of these small grains must be in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "it is supposed that in addition to their vibrational emission , these small grains will also rotate ( erickson 1957 ; ferrara & detmar 1994 ; draine & lazarian 1998 ) . the emission from this rotation is found , using simple thermodynamical arguments , to be in the cm - wave regime of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the details of the rotational excitation and damping have been examined in detail by draine & lazarian ( 1998 ) and their models have been found to be in good argreement with observational results .    although the anomalous emission was originally seen as a large - scale phenomenon ( leitch et  al .",
    "1997 , see also kogut et  al .",
    "1996 ) in cmb observations it has also been seen to occur in a number of different types of astronomical objects , such as regions , dark clouds and photodissociation regions ( casassus et  al . 2006 ; dickinson et  al . 2007 ;",
    "scaife et  al .",
    "2007 ; ami consortium : scaife et  al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is often found to be correlated with thermal dust emission , but this is not always the case ( casassus et  al .",
    "a growing number of observations have detected dust - correlated cm - wave emission which is inconsistent with free  free emission .",
    "however , these few observations are not yet sufficient to make any definite observational statement about the enviromental factors which influence whether emission from spinning grains will be seen towards a certain object .",
    "we hope that the observations presented here will contribute significantly to improving this knowledge .",
    "in this paper we have imaged fourteen dark molecular clouds .",
    "our sample is selected from the submillimetre survey of dark molecular clouds performed using the submillimetre common - user bolometre array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) by visser , richer & chandler ( 2001 ) . of these fourteen only three",
    "are currently known to contain protostars ( l944 , l1014 and l1246 ; visser et  al .",
    "2001 ; young et  al .",
    "2004 ) , with the remainder thought to be examples of pre - stellar cores .",
    "the dark molecular clouds in this sample were taken from the lynds dark nebula catalogue ( lynds 1962 ) of 1802 optically selected dark clouds from the poss plates .",
    "the scuba jiggle mapping function used to observe the sample restricted the field of view to 2.3 arcmin diameter .",
    "this constraint led to a selection criterion of a maximum semi - minor axis of @xmath8arcmin for each cloud , which was determined from their optical size as listed in parker ( 1988 ) .",
    "the lynds catalogue is divided into opacity classes from 1 to 6 of which 6 is the most opaque and includes 147 clouds .",
    "the clouds observed in the scuba survey are all class 6 ( @xmath9mag ; lynds 1962 ) and should therefore provide the highest column density of dust when searching for anomalous emission from spinning grains .    we have observed all clouds in the sample of visser et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) which fall in the available declination range of the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) small array ( sa ) instrument in cambridge .",
    "the small angular size of these clouds makes them well matched to the size of the ami sa synthesized beam .",
    "we identify excess microwave emission from the scuba clouds as any source which falls within a 2arcmin radius of the scuba position and which shows an excess of emission relative to lower frequency radio data .",
    "in addition , any source which satisfies these two criteria but has a falling spectrum across the ami band will be rejected as a spinning dust candidate .",
    "this allows us to distinguish those sources which may be optically thick at lower radio frequencies , but have spectra which turn over before the ami band .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section 2 describes the telescope and the observations , section 3 details the methods we use to compare our data to lower frequency observations , section 4 discusses each object individually and section 5 discusses the sample as a whole and states our conclusions .",
    "ami comprises two synthesis arrays , one of ten 3.7 m antennas ( small array ) and one of eight 13 m antennas ( large array ) , both sited at lord s bridge , cambridge ( ami consortium : zwart et  al .",
    "the telescope observes in the band 13.517.9ghz with cryostatically cooled nrao indium - phosphide front - end amplifiers .",
    "the overall system temperature is approximately 25k .",
    "the radio frequency is mixed with a 24ghz local oscillator , down converting to an intermediate frequency band of 610.5ghz .",
    "amplification , equalization , path compensation and automatic gain control are then applied to the if signal .",
    "the correlator is an analogue fourier transform spectrometer with 16 correlations formed for each baseline at path delays spaced by 26 mm .",
    "in addition both real and imaginary correlations are formed by use of 0@xmath10 and 180@xmath10 hybrids . from these , eight 0.75ghz bandwidth channels are synthesized . in practice , the two lowest frequency channels ( 1 & 2 ) are not generally used due to a low response in this frequency range and interference from geostationary satellites .",
    "observations of fourteen dark molecular clouds from the lynds dark nebula catalogue were made with the ami sa telescope during the period 2007 january  may .",
    "the ami la was not used in this work . here",
    "we present data for each of these regions , which are listed in table  [ tab : lclouds ] .",
    "these targets were chosen from the submillimetre survey of visser et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) as small molecular clouds , well matched to the ami synthesized beam , in a declination range consistent with the capabilities of the ami at a latitude of @xmath11 n. each pointing was observed at least twice for at least eight hours , with the exception of l1185 which was observed only once due to poor weather .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     of our five possibly anomalous objects two are known to be class 0 objects : l944 and l1246 .",
    "high sensitivity maps in co towards our two most anomalous objects do not yet exist and they are assumed starless .",
    "however the starless / protostellar divide has come under scrutiny recently following the discovery of very low luminosity objects ( vellos ) with _",
    "spitzer_. vellos are faint infrared point sources with protostellar colours towards objects previously classified as starless .",
    "young et  al .  ( 2004 ) discovered a vello in l1014 ( l1014-irs ) , part of the visser et al.sample , coincident with the peak of dust continuum emission that had been previously classified as starless by parker ( 1988 ) .",
    "although here no anomalous microwave emission is seen towards l1014 it is suggestive that the peak of the anomalous emission towards l944 is more coincident with the centre of the red - shifted co @xmath12 outflow lobe , mapped by visser et al . , and",
    "not the compact scuba emission from the class 0 protostar .",
    "this spatial correspondence immediately raises the question of whether the outflow itself or possibly the cloud turbulence could be energising the spinning dust emission .",
    "regardless of this possible connection we also point out that the misidentification of radio emission from protostars is a potential source of confusion when searching for emission from spinning dust .",
    "there seems to be no obvious correlation between the ami flux densities and the iras or scuba flux densities , however the number of data points is low .",
    "it is also true that there is no correlation between the scuba flux densities at 850@xmath6 m and those of iras at 100@xmath6 m .",
    "this is perhaps not particularly surprising in light of the mismatch in measured angular scales , and would suggest that the morphology of these objects is larger at 850@xmath6 m than the scuba chop allows for .",
    "obviously this is not a problem when investigating compact cores as in visser et  al .",
    "( 2001 ; 2002 ) , however it provides little assistance when looking at the correlation between cm - wave amd mm - wave emission .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have observed a sample of fourteen compact lynds dark nebulae .",
    "we have found a significant excess towards two of the fourteen and an indication of anomalous behaviour in three further clouds .",
    "we suggest that the excess we see is due to rotational emission from very small grains and that this emission may be correlated with a high level of background emission at lower radio frequencies .",
