    "the response of organic scintillators to particle interactions in terms of the dependence on material , incident particle type and incident particle energy were first discussed by birks  @xcite . in general , it is found that the response arising from nuclear recoils ( such as when irradiated by neutrons ) is significantly diminished in comparison to the light output obtained from electron recoils ( such as when irradiated by @xmath5-rays ) . at higher energies ( mev and above )",
    ", the scintillation output is generally found to be proportional to energy deposition but , at lower energies , a strong departure from proportionality has been observed for nuclear recoils .",
    "a thorough characterisation and understanding of such effects is essential for accurate low energy calibration , especially given the widespread use of scintillators in contemporary science .",
    "one specific example , where the low energy response to nuclear recoils is paramount , can be found in the field of direct dark matter searches , both for the response of the dark matter targets themselves ( e.g.  noble liquid scintillators ) , and where scintillators find their application in anti - coincidence detector systems  @xcite .",
    "it is in this context that the present results have been obtained .",
    "conceptual designs for future , large active neutron rejection systems featuring scintillators are under discussion  @xcite , and will require improved knowledge of the low energy response , even when the main neutron detection mechanism is via radiative capture . in the case of polystyrene - based scintillators , little data exist for recoils below @xmath61  mev , which are produced , for example , by radioactivity neutrons .",
    "the present measurements were performed with the plastic scintillator used in the veto detector of the zeplin ",

    "run the detector has been enclosed by a polystyrene , ( c@xmath7h@xmath7)@xmath8 , based veto detector  @xcite .",
    "the veto instrument includes 52 modules individually coupled to photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , totalling @xmath61  tonne of scintillator , which , in the form of a barrel and a roof , surround the wimp target . for a detailed discussion of the realised performance of the veto detector ,",

    "the scintillation light yield for a nuclear recoil of a given energy is quenched , _",
    "i.e. _ , reduced in comparison to the scintillation output observed from an electron recoil of the same energy . a significant contribution to this difference",
    "may be identified with the heat associated with the atom cascades generated by nuclear recoils as described by lindhard  @xcite . a formalism",
    "in which the scintillation light yield of highly ionising particles depends not only on the energy of the particle but also on its stopping power in specific materials was developed by birks  @xcite , of which a detailed description is presented in ref .",
    "the resulting relation may be written as :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the scintillation yield per unit path length @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the absolute scintillation factor , @xmath13 is the density of excitation centres along the recoil ionisation track and @xmath14 is a quenching factor . by finding the ratio between the light yield for electron recoils , @xmath15 , and for ions , @xmath16 , eqn .",

    "this is especially significant for the low energy region where the stopping power experiences greatest variation .",
    "the majority of the measurements obtained to - date for the quenching factor in plastic scintillators concentrate on neutrons and protons in the energy region above @xmath61  mev  @xcite . in recent years , the need for precise knowledge of neutron quenching factors for materials used in the direct search for dark matter has led to significant new measurements at low energies , often making use of dedicated neutron scattering facilities  @xcite .",
    "however , no recent measurements have been reported for plastic scintillators despite their incorporation into several low energy event experiments . in this paper we present measurements of",
    "nuclear recoil quenching factors for energies below 1  mev down to 125  kev .",
    "one of the 52 plastic scintillator modules of the veto detector was used for data taking in the boulby underground laboratory , an intrinsically low background environment .",
    "the scintillator bar has the form of a parallelepiped of length 1  m , width 15  cm , and a trapezoidal cross - section with parallel sides of length 15  cm and 12  cm . the polystyrene - based scintillator material ( ups923a , p - terphenyl 2@xmath19 , popop 0.02@xmath19 , produced by amcrys - h , kharkov , ukraine @xcite ) has a density of 1.06  g/@xmath20 and a refractive index of 1.52 for blue light .",
    "the average light output for electron recoils has been measured to be @xmath65500  photons / mev  @xcite .",
    "the scintillation light shows a peak intensity at 420  nm , a rise time of 0.9  ns and a decay time of 3.3  ns .",
    "the average bulk attenuation length for the 52 modules has been experimentally measured and is found to be approximately 1  m  @xcite .    to increase the effective attenuation length of the plastic and improve light collection , a specularly reflective aluminised mylar foil",
    "is placed at one end .",
    "additionally , the module has been wrapped in diffuse reflector ptfe sheet on all sides .",
    "light produced in the scintillator is detected with a pmt ( etel9302 kb ) of quantum efficiency 30@xmath19  @xcite optically coupled to the end opposite the mirror .",
    "energy spectra were recorded with the dedicated data acquisition system of the veto detector ( caen model v1724 ) , which digitises waveforms with 14-bit resolution , 02.25 v input range , 40  mhz bandwidth and a sampling rate of 10  ms / s . in this",
    "instance waveforms were parameterised using a bespoke data reduction software adapted from that developed for the zeplin - iii instrument  @xcite .",
    "the trigger was provided by an external pulse generator at a constant frequency .",
    "additionally , during the neutron source measurements , data were taken simultaneously with a single - channel pulse height analyser (  maestro sca \" ) , triggered by an internal discriminator .    to measure the response to nuclear recoils ,",
    "the scintillator was exposed to neutrons from a @xmath21am - be ( @xmath22,n ) source and , separately , to a @xmath23cf fission source .",
    "the plastic was shielded from @xmath5-ray emission from the sources and the environment by enclosing it in a 20  cm thick castle composed of low - background cu and pb in equal parts with an additional 4  cm of lead on the roof .",
    "neutron exposures were performed with the sources placed directly on the castle ( @xmath650  cm above the sealed scintillator ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the setup were explored extensively from which it was found that variation in neutron source position had negligible effect .",
    "crucially , @xmath5-ray attenuation and external electron - recoil contamination within the nuclear recoil data have been quantified using monte carlo simulations and dedicated measurements ( see sec .",
    "iii for detailed discussion of simulations ) .",
    "in particular , we examined the effect of varying the thickness of lead shielding placed over the castle .",
    "@xmath5-ray emission spectra from the @xmath23cf and am - be sources ( reconstructed from values given in the nudat database @xcite ) have been studied separately .",
    "the actual @xmath5-ray activities were 21,000@xmath12,100 @xmath5/s for the @xmath23cf source and 6,300@xmath1400 @xmath5/s for the am - be source ( the latter accounts only for the two highest energy @xmath5-rays of 3.21  mev and 4.44  mev from de - excitation of @xmath24c@xmath25 populated by the be(@xmath22,n ) reaction ) .",
    "the simulations indicate that a single @xmath5-ray from the am - be source would be transmitted through the shielding along with every 30,000 neutrons ( of which @xmath6600 deposited energy in the scintillator bar ) for the nominal lead thickness in our configuration , while no @xmath5-rays from the @xmath23cf source exposure would be observed .",
    "thus , the results show that the @xmath5-ray fluxes from the sources make no significant contribution to the neutron exposure data . to confirm this conclusion ,",
    "an extended exposure of the scintillator to a 11  kbq @xmath26co @xmath5-ray source ( 1.17 and 1.33 mev @xmath5-rays ) placed externally on the upper surface of the enclosure was performed .",
    "no measurable increase in event rate over background was observed .",
    "given that contributions from the @xmath5-rays coming from the sources themselves are negligible in the neutron measurements , most @xmath5-rays detected during the neutron exposure are generated internally ( inelastic scattering and radiative neutron capture ) .",
    "non source - related backgrounds , arising , for example , from low level activity of shielding components and the plastic scintillator itself , are measurable but not significant above a threshold of 2 photoelectrons ( phe ) .",
    "the methodology used to extract the quenching factor was first applied to liquid argon scintillation by the warp group @xcite ; other examples followed @xcite .",

    "an iterative process is used to optimise the quenching factor , minimising on @xmath27 in the comparison between data and simulated energy spectra .",
    "the simulations have been performed with the geant4 toolkit  @xcite ( version 9.2 , with neutron cross - sections from endf / b - vi  @xcite ) using standard neutron spectra for the two sources ( am - be iso 8529 - 1  @xcite , @xmath23cf fission spectrum from sources-4c @xcite ) . emitted neutrons and their secondaries",
    "are propagated including all relevant nuclear and electromagnetic physical processes ; a set of optical processes describes the generation and detection of scintillation light from nuclear and electron recoil interactions in the scintillator .",
    "these photons are tracked to the photocathode of the pmt including relevant optical effects ( reflection , refraction , attenuation ) at which point the production of photoelectrons is simulated .",
    "appropriate random fluctuations are included to model the production of scintillation photons and the production of photoelectrons from the pmt photocathode .",
    "it should be noted that for a full description of neutron scattering in hydrogenous materials the standard geant4 elastic scattering process must be supplemented with a model ( g4neutronhpthermalscattering ) to describe the energy region below 4  ev for the correct treatment of thermal neutron scattering from chemically - bound atoms . in these molecules",
    "several temperature - dependent vibrational modes are possible , which alter the scattering cross - section  @xcite .",
    "this is of particular relevance to this study and radiative capture on hydrogen is enhanced by @xmath620% over the standard model .",
    "by definition , the response of the plastic scintillator to is unquenched , allowing standard @xmath5-ray sources to be used to determine the overall gain of the system .",
    "moreover , it is expected that the geant4 simulations should provide an excellent match to the @xmath5-ray calibration data , validating most processes included in the physics model and the accuracy of the geometry implementation .",
    "the pmt gain was set such that both single photoelectron ( spe ) peaks and compton edge features could be resolved in all spectra , allowing presentation of the data in terms of absolute numbers of photoelectrons .    with the roof of the shielding castle open ,",
    "calibration measurements with a @xmath28cs @xmath5-ray source ( 4.7  kbq ) were performed .",

    "the result of a geant4 simulation of this exposure is shown by the dashed red line ; excellent agreement across the full energy range is demonstrated .",
    "the scintillator module used has an attenuation length of  80  cm and the photoelectron yield with the calibration source above the centre of the plastic ( 48.7  cm from the photocathode face ) is measured to be @xmath644  phe / mev .",
    "the present simulations do not include spurious effects such as dark emission from the photocathode , after - pulsing , or @xmath29 radiation from @xmath30k contamination in the glass pmt envelope .",
    "each of these effects are known to contribute at the single to few photoelectron level with significant rate  @xcite .",

    "the spectra at the scintillator interface include single neutrons being recorded multiple times as they are scattered out of the scintillator and re - enter again after interacting with the shielding .",
    "the recorded energy depositions are the total integrated signal from each individual neutron - induced recoil event .",
    "the shielding attenuates significantly the neutron flux , and scattering reduces the energies of surviving particles .",
    "since this is a large effect , we quantified how the uncertainty in the lead thickness affects the neutron spectrum at the scintillator interface .",
    "variations up to @xmath10.5  cm are found to be statistically insignificant .",
    "the impact of thresholds in the simulated neutron source spectra ( 50 kev in both instances ) has been examined .",

    "this feature , appearing at @xmath690  phe ( with @xmath32  @xmath630  phe ) may , thus , be used to normalise the energy scales of simulated to observed spectra and extract a quenching factor for the nuclear recoils . both figures",

    "<S> plastic scintillators are widely used in industry , medicine and scientific research , including nuclear and particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> although one of their most common applications is in neutron detection , experimental data on their response to low - energy nuclear recoils are scarce . here , the relative scintillation efficiency for neutron - induced nuclear recoils in a polystyrene - based plastic scintillator ( ups923a ) is presented , exploring recoil energies between 125  kev and 850  kev . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations , incorporating light collection efficiency and energy resolution effects , are used to generate neutron scattering spectra which are matched to observed distributions of scintillation signals to parameterise the energy - dependent quenching factor . at energies above 300 kev the dependence is reasonably described using the semi - empirical formulation of birks and a @xmath0 factor of ( 0.014@xmath10.002 )  g@xmath2mev@xmath3@xmath4 has been determined . below that energy </S>",
    "<S> the measured quenching factor falls more steeply than predicted by the birks formalism . </S>"
