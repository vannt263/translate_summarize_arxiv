    "extensive studies of graphene have shown that it displays a wide range of remarkable electronic properties @xcite and there has been much speculation on its role in future electro- and electro - optical devices .",
    "however , although unique , the properties of graphene are not ideal .",
    "for example , the gapless band structure and resulting minimum conductivity leads to low on - off ratios , a major obstacle in the development of usable graphene transistors @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to create efficient devices , one needs to alter graphene s intrinsic electronic properties .",
    "a number of approaches to this ` band structure engineering ' have been investigated ; geometric confinement @xcite , doping @xcite , and substrate interaction effects @xcite , to name but a few .    another intriguing possibility is the use of strain .",
    "the band structure of a material is directly related to its crystal lattice . by applying a force",
    ", one can deform a material s crystal lattice and , hence , change its electronic properties .",
    "a number of studies have already proposed , gap generation @xcite , modification of graphene s optical properties @xcite and even the appearance of superconductivity @xcite under strain .",
    "another feature of strained graphene is the appearance of artificial vector potentials and pseudo - magnetic fields @xcite with predicted field strengths ranging from tens @xcite to thousands of tesla @xcite for both in - plane and out - of - plane strains .",
    "the ability to generate such pseudo - magnetic fields would remove the need for cumbersome external field generation and could pave the way for a generation of highly compact magneto - electronic and spintronic devices . in light of this , there have been a number of previous studies using a variety of methods ; rotation free linear strain theory @xcite , rotational finite strain theory @xcite or , more recently , rotational finite strain theory up to second order in the strain tensor @xcite as well as first principle atomistic simulations @xcite .",
    "however , both the infinitesimal ( linear ) and finite strain tensors are based on the small displacements of infinitesimal length vectors @xcite",
    ". it would be advantageous to generalize this to large displacements of finite length vectors .    here",
    ", we present a theory that uses a differential geometry method from which one is able calculate the exact , strain induced displacements for finite length vectors , thus going beyond the finite strain theory , which is based on small displacements of infinitesimal length vectors .",
    "this method gives a new finite displacement term that is found to be of comparable magnitude to the rotation and linear strain contributions .",
    "as an example , we compute the pseudo - magnetic field generated in graphene by a ` point stretch ' - where a pair of opposing point forces act laterally across the centre of a wide graphene ribbon .",
    "the resulting field is found to be a function of the finite displacement term only and that it displays a ` domain wall'-like profile with a maximum field strength that is over three times that which is predicted by the linear strain theory alone .",
    "in a strained material , the locations of the constituent atoms change from their equilibrium position , @xmath0 , to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the displacement vector , which is , itself , a function of the equilibrium position of the atom ( in the following we will use index notation with implied summation over repeated indices ) .",
    "in general , for a given applied force , the displacements , @xmath2 , are not ( _ a priori _ ) known and , hence , one characterizes the deformation in terms of the strain tensor , @xmath3 , which can be found from the stress tensor , @xmath4 , using the generalized hooke s law , @xmath5 .",
    "( in principle the displacements can be found from the elastic green function , however , formulating the equations of equilibrium for a material body usually involves some assumptions about the form of the strain tensor @xcite ) .",
    "the rank-4 tensor @xmath6 is the compliance tensor whose components are related to the mechanical properties of the material .",
    "previous studies @xcite , which have considered rotation free , linear displacements ( symmetric , spatially constant strain tensors ) , have found that the locations of the displaced atoms are given by , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the kronecker delta .",
    "rotations are easily accounted for by the inclusion of the rotation tensor @xcite , @xmath9 , via @xmath10 .",
    "the rotation tensor is antisymmetric , trace free and related to the strain tensor by @xmath11 .",
    "the inclusion of large , spatially varying displacements is slightly more involved .",
    "the infinitesimal strain tensor gives the local change of an infinitesimal length over small displacements .",
    "for the change of finite lengths over a large displacements one needs to ` integrate ' the infinitesimal strain tensor over the deformation . this can be done using methods from differential geometry to account for the change in the strain tensor as the deformation progresses .",
    "the change in the element of length of an infinitesimal vector , @xmath12 , under strain is given by @xcite @xmath13 thus , the strain tensor acts as a metric with the large , spatially varying displacements accounted for by the ` non - euclidean ' nature of the strain tensor .",
    "note that , since the metric is , by definition , an infinitesimal object , one only needs consider the unique infinitesimal strain tensor and not one of the many finite strain tensor ( e.g. green - lagrange , almansi , etc . ) . for vanishing strain ,",
    "the metric is euclidean , @xmath14 , and hence the tangent spaces at different points on the manifold are identical .",
    "thus , a vector , @xmath15 , defined in the tangent space at the origin and a vector , @xmath16 , defined in the tangent space at a point @xmath17 are comparable and the parallel transport of @xmath15 from the origin to @xmath17 leaves it unchanged ( @xmath15 = @xmath16 ) . for non - vanishing strain the ` non - euclidean ' nature of the metric means tangent spaces at each point are different .",
    "thus , a vector , @xmath18 , defined in the tangent space at the origin and a vector , @xmath19 , in the tangent space at a point @xmath17 are not comparable .",
    "the parallel transport of @xmath18 from the origin to the @xmath17 causes it to change by an amount proportional to the metric connections .",
    "thus , in general , @xmath20 with the difference between the two dependent on the form of the metric ( which in this case is a function of the strain tensor ) .",
    "as the tangent space at the origin in the deformed material is isomorphic to euclidean space and , hence , the undeformed material , we have @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the parallel transport of @xmath15 from the origin to the point @xmath22 will give @xmath19 and hence the displacement owing to the spatial variation of the strain tensor ( see fig .",
    "[ metric ] ) .     in the undeformed material is unchanged when parallel transported along the solid line to @xmath17 .",
    "the vector @xmath18 in the deformed material is changed when parallel transported along the dotted line to @xmath17 .",
    "this change is a direct result of the spatially varying displacement of the material and , hence , from this change the displacements can be found . ]    to compute this we employ the parallel transport equation , familiar from differential geometry , @xmath23r_{j}(\\lambda)\\frac{dr_{k}(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 parametrizes the path over which the vector is parallel transported . here ,",
    "@xmath25 are the metric connections that can be expressed uniquely in terms of the christoffel symbols of the first kind and are give , in terms of the metric , by @xmath26 we wish to transport the vector @xmath0 from the origin at @xmath27 along it s length to @xmath28 .",

    "this goes beyond the usual finite strain theory which , although second order , is still based on the displacement of infinitesimal vectors .",
    "note that , in the case of linear deformations ( constant strain tensor ) , the christoffel symbols , @xmath25 , vanish .",
    "thus , the finite displacement term also vanishes and one recovers the results of previous studies @xcite .    finally , one finds that the change in the vector locations of atoms displaced by a general spatially varying strain are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 $ ] is the finite displacement term . hence from eq .",
    "one is able to find the displacement vectors , @xmath35 , for any point in the deformed material .",

    "furthermore we can drop the last term in eq . as it is second order the bond length and hence its contribution to the band structure will be small .",
    "thus one finds @xmath44 with @xmath45 the transformation @xmath46 gives the displacement of the lattice vectors in the neighbourhood of @xmath37 and is a function of the global coordinate , @xmath37 , only .",
