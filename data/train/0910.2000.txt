    "in the energy regime of the hadron spectroscopy , qcd does not admit a perturbative expansion in terms of the coupling constant of the theory . a interesting solution to",
    "the problem is to generalize qcd to @xmath4 colors , @xmath0 becoming the expansion parameter of the theory @xcite . in the large @xmath4 limit , qcd possesses an exact contracted su@xmath5 symmetry @xcite . for large but finite @xmath4",
    ", the contracted su@xmath5 becomes the su(@xmath6 ) symmetry group of the constituent quark model .",
    "the ground states baryons are degenerate in the @xmath7 limit and the mass splitting starts at order @xmath0 @xcite .    following the quark model classification of excited baryons ,",
    "it is generally assumed that in the large @xmath4 limit , the su(@xmath8o(3 ) symmetry is satisfied . for the @xmath9 band , at large but finite @xmath4 , it has been shown that this symmetry is broken at order @xmath10 by several operators , in particular by the spin - orbit operator , so that the mass splitting starts at order @xmath10 .",
    "this review is devoted to the description of the lowest negative parity baryons , belonging to the @xmath11 $ ] multiplet ( the @xmath9 band ) .",
    "the wave function of these baryons is mixed symmetric in the orbital and the spin - flavor parts . as a consequence ,",
    "the calculation of the spectrum becomes more complicated than for symmetric states . during the last four years",
    ", this became a controversial subject .",
    "the traditional procedure was based on a hartree approximation , the baryon being described by an orbitally excited ( @xmath12 ) quark moving in the collective potential generated by a ground state core composed of @xmath13 quarks .",
    "accordingly , only the @xmath14 configuration was considered in the orbital part .",
    "the other components of the wave function needed to obtain a mixed symmetric orbital and spin - flavor states were neglected @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the generators of su(@xmath6 ) were written as the sum of two terms , one acting on the core and the other on the excited quark . in this way",
    "the number of linearly independent terms in the mass formula becomes tremendously large which creates difficulties in choosing the dominant ones .",
    "one can go beyond this approximation and treat the wave function of the baryons exactly in order to avoid the decoupling of the system into a core and an excited quark @xcite . in this case",
    "the wave function has the correct symmetry but it requires the knowledge of the matrix elements of the spin - flavor generators for the mixed symmetric states .",
    "these matrix elements have been derived for su(4 ) in the sixties @xcite but only recently for su(6 ) @xcite .    for a comparison",
    ", one can include the neglected terms of the wave function in the traditional decoupling picture , but others group theoretical difficulties appear related to the knowledge of isoscalar factors of the permutation group s@xmath15 .",
    "this problem has already been solved for nonstrange baryons @xcite .",
    "the strange baryons are underway and will be presented in a future publication @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall briefly describe the two procedures .",
    "to satisfy the pauli principle , the wave function describing a baryon must be antisymmetric .",
    "this wave function is usually the product of its orbital ( o ) , spin ( s ) , flavor ( f ) and color ( c ) parts . as in nature the baryons are colorless , the color part is always antisymmetric , the orbital - spin - flavor is then symmetric .",
    "as the color plays no role in the mass analysis , one integrates it out and considers only the orbital - spin - flavor part only .",
    "here we are interested in the multiplet @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "its orbital and spin - flavor parts must have both a mixed symmetry which for arbitrary @xmath4 has the partition @xmath2 $ ] . in terms of inner products of the permutation group @xmath16 ,",
    "the wave function takes the form @xmath17 y \\rangle_{o }   |[n_c-1,1 ] y \\rangle_{fs},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the corresponding young tableau .",
    "here we sum over the @xmath3 possible standard young tableaux .",
    "the factor @xmath19 represents the clebsch - gordan coefficient ( cg ) of @xmath16 needed to construct a symmetric wave function @xmath20 $ ] from its mixed symmetric parts .",
    "let us first introduce the global wave function , without the decoupling of the excited quark from the ground state core . in that case , as the matrix elements of the operators are identical for all @xmath18 due to weyl s duality between a linear group and a symmetric group in a given tensor space , one does not need to specify @xmath18",

    "there , as mentioned above , the su(2)-isospin casimir operator was written as @xmath48 and decomposed into three independent pieces , corresponding to the terms in the above decomposition . as mentioned , in su(4 ) @xmath49 and @xmath50 have identical matrix elements because the spin and isospin states of a symmetric core are identical , so that @xmath49 was ignored . but @xmath51 has different matrix elements from @xmath52 as one can clearly see from table ii of ref . @xcite .",
    "then in the decoupling scheme the isospin can be introduced only through @xmath51 . in table",
    "[ defit1 ] we have shown that the introduction of the operators @xmath53 together with @xmath54 and @xmath55 separately deteriorates the fit .",

    "we plan to extend our study to su(6 ) , to look for differences between results obtained with the exact wave function on the one hand , and the approximate one , used in the decoupling scheme , on the other hand .",
