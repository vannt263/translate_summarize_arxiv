    "identifying the universal principles and patterns that shape cities and urban human activities is crucial for both fundamental and practical reasons , as it not only sheds light on social organizations , but is also crucial for planning and designing safer and more sustainable cities .",
    "complex systems approaches @xcite provide us with tools and new ways of thinking about urban areas and the ways they may correspond to living organisms @xcite .",
    "the activities of people in urban areas are responsible for the emergence of patterns on large scales that define the dynamics of cities .    until recently , one of the main obstacles to quantify such ideas was the lack of large scale data on flows of people and their activities . however , in the last decade there has been a surge of new technologies that make it possible to obtain real - time data about populations , and these new `` social microscopes '' have changed in fundamental ways the study of social systems @xcite .",
    "recent examples include characterizing @xcite and predicting @xcite individual human mobility patterns using mobile phone and social media data . toward that end",
    ", twitter has been a valuable tool to track and to identify patterns of mobility and activity , especially using geolocated tweets .",

    "we observe and quantify the patterns that emerge naturally from the hourly activities at different subareas , and discuss how they can be used to understand the social dynamics of urban areas .",
    "twitter data can be understood not just by considering where people are but also by the extent to which they are preoccupied or have time and attention to devote to twitter posting .",
    "we collected more than 6 million geolocated messages from twitter s streaming application programming interface ( api ) @xcite from which more than 90@xmath0 of geolocated tweets can be downloaded as they occur @xcite . from this data we observe wake / sleep cycles and the daily social `` heartbeat '' of the nyc area , reflecting the commuting dynamics from home to work in the diurnal cycle .",
    "we identify differences in weekday and weekend dynamics , and find specific locations where activity occurs at certain hours , including the early morning at air transit hubs .",
    "we also find anomalous events associated with specific individuals whose high engagement with twitter at specific times can dominate their local region .",

    "after 8:00am the distance grows gradually during the day and through the evening , until it falls again overnight .",

    "the largest scale daily dynamics are the waking and sleeping cycle and commuting from the suburbs to office areas in manhattan , while the hourly dynamics reflects the interplay between commuting , work and leisure .",
    "we showed not only that twitter can provide insight into understanding human social activity patterns , but also that our analysis is capable of identifying interesting locations of activity by focusing on departures from global behaviors .",
    "we observed a peak of twitter usage in the suburbs of nyc before people begin their workday , and during evening hours , while the main activity during the workday and late at night is in manhattan .",
