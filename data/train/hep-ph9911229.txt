    "in theories with extra dimensions , @xmath0 , the gauge fields of the standard model(sm ) will have kaluza - klein(kk ) excitations if they are allowed to propagate in the bulk of the extra dimensions .",
    "if such a scenario is realized then , level by level , the masses of the excited states of the photon , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and gluon would form highly degenerate towers .",
    "the possibility that the masses of the lowest lying of these states , of order the inverse size of the compactification radius @xmath3 , could be as low as @xmath4 a few tev or less leads to a very rich and exciting phenomenology at future and , possibly , existing colliders@xcite . for the case of one extra dimension compactified on @xmath5 the spectrum of the excited states is given by @xmath6 and the couplings of the excited modes relative to the corresponding zero mode to states remaining on the wall at the orbifold fixed points , such as the sm fermions , is simply @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "these masses and couplings are insensitive to the choice of compactification in the case of one extra dimension assuming the metric tensor factorizes , , the elements of the metric tensor on the wall are independent of the compactified co - ordinates .    if such kk states exist what is the lower bound on their mass ?",
    "we already know from direct @xmath9 and dijet bump searches at the tevatron from run i that they must lie above @xmath10 tev@xcite . a null result for a search made with data from run ii will push this limit to @xmath11 tev or so .",
    "to do better than this at present we must rely on the indirect effects associated with kk tower exchange in what essentially involves a set of dimension - six contact interactions .",
    "such limits rely upon a number of additional assumptions , in particular , that the effect of kk exchanges is the _ only _ new physics beyond the sm . the strongest and least model - dependent of these bounds arises from an analysis of charged current contact interactions at both hera and the tevatron by cornet , relano and rico@xcite who , in the case of one extra dimension , obtain a bound of @xmath12 tev .",
    "similar analyses have been carried out by a number of authors@xcite ; the best limit arises from an updated combined fit to the precision electroweak data@xcite as presented at the 1999 summer conferences@xcite and yields@xcite @xmath13 tev for the case of one extra dimension . from the previous discussion we can also draw a further conclusion for the case @xmath14 : the lower bound @xmath15 tev is so strong that the _ second _ kk excitations , whose masses must now exceed 7.8 tev due to the above scaling law , will be beyond the reach of the lhc .",
    "this leads to the important result that the lhc will _ at most _ only detect the first set of kk excitations for @xmath14 .    in all analyses that obtain indirect limits on @xmath16 ,",
    "one is actually constraining a dimensionless quantity such as @xmath17 where , generalizing the case to @xmath18 additional dimensions , @xmath19 is the coupling and @xmath20 the mass of the @xmath21 kk level labelled by the set of @xmath18 integers *",
    "n * and @xmath22 is the @xmath2 boson mass which we employ as a typical weak scale factor . for @xmath14",
    "this sum is finite since @xmath6 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 ; one immediately obtains @xmath25 with @xmath16 being the mass of the first kk excitation . from the precision data one obtains a bound on @xmath26 and then uses the above expression to obtain the corresponding bound on @xmath16 . for @xmath27 , however , independently of how the extra dimensions are compactified , the above sum in @xmath26 _ diverges _ and so it is not so straightforward to obtain a bound on @xmath16 .",
    "we also recall that for @xmath27 the mass spectrum and the relative coupling strength of any particular kk excitation now become dependent upon how the additional dimensions are compactified .",
    "there are several ways one can deal with this divergence : ( @xmath28 ) the simplest approach is to argue that as the states being summed in @xmath26 get heavier they approach the mass of the string scale , @xmath29 , above which we know little and some new theory presumably takes over .",
    "thus we should just truncate the sum at some fixed maximum value @xmath30 so that masses kk masses above @xmath29 do not contribute .",
    "( @xmath31 ) a second possibility is to note that the wall on which the sm fermions reside is not completely rigid having a finite tension .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite argue that this wall tension can act like an exponential suppression of the couplings of the higher kk states in the tower thus rendering the summation finite , , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 now parameterizes the strength of the exponential cut - off .",
    "( antoniadis@xcite has argued that such an exponential suppression can also arise from considerations of string scattering amplitudes at high energies . ) for a fixed value of @xmath33 , the exponential approach is found to be more effective and lead to a smaller sum than that obtained by simple truncation and thus to a weaker bound on @xmath16 .",
    "( @xmath34 ) a last scenario@xcite is to note the possibility that the sm wall fermions may have a finite size in the extra dimensions which smear out and soften the couplings appearing in the sum to yield a finite result . in this case",
    "the suppression is also of the gaussian variety .",
    "we note that in all of the above approaches the value of the sum increases rapidly with @xmath18 for a fixed value of the cut - off parameter @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath35 the sum behaves asymptotically as @xmath36 .",
    "this leads to the very important result that , for a fixed bound on @xmath26 from experimental data , the corresponding bound on the mass of the lowest lying kk excitation rapidly strengthens with the number of extra dimension , @xmath18 .",
    "table i shows how the @xmath14 lower bound of 3.9 tev for the mass of @xmath16 changes as we consider different compactifications for @xmath27 .",
    "we see that in some cases the value of @xmath16 is so large it will be beyond the mass range accessible to the lhc as it is for all cases of the @xmath37 example .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "let us return to the @xmath14 case at the lhc where the degenerate kk states @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are potentially visible .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for masses in excess of @xmath42 tev the @xmath41 resonance in dijets will be washed out due to its rather large width and the experimental jet energy resolution available at the lhc detectors . furthermore , @xmath38 and @xmath39 will appear as a _",
    "single _ resonance in drell - yan that can not be resolved and looking very much like a single @xmath43 .",
    "thus if we are lucky the lhc will observe what appears to be a degenerate @xmath9 .",
    "how can we identify these states as kk excitations when we remember that the rest of the members of the tower are too massive to be produced ?",
    "we remind the reader that many extended electroweak models@xcite exist which predict a degenerate @xmath9 . without further information",
    ", it would seem likely that this would become the most likely guess of what had been found .",
    "to clarify this situation let us consider the results displayed in figs . 1 for @xmath14 where we show the production cross sections in the @xmath44 channel with inverse compactification radii of 4 , 5 and 6 tev .",
    "in calculating these cross sections we have assumed that the kk excitations have their naive couplings and can only decay to the usual fermions of the sm .",
    "additional decay modes can lead to appreciably lower cross sections so that we can not use the peak heights to determine the degeneracy of the kk state .",
    "note that in the 4 tev case , which is essentially as small a mass as can be tolerated by the present data on precision measurements , the second kk excitation is visible in the plot .",
    "we see several things from these figures .",
    "first , we can easily estimate the total number of events in the resonance regions associated with each of the peaks assuming the canonical integrated luminosity of @xmath45 appropriate for the lhc ; we find @xmath46 events corresponding to the 4(5,6,8 ) tev resonances if we sum over both electron and muon final states and assume @xmath47 leptonic identification efficiencies .",
    "clearly the 6 and 8 tev resonances will not be visible at the lhc ( though a modest increase in luminosity by a factor of a few will allow the 6 tev resonance to become visible ) and we also verify our claim that only the first kk excitations will be observable . in the case of the 4 tev resonance",
    "there is sufficient statistics that the kk mass will be well measured and one can also imagine measuring the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath48 , if not the full angular distribution of the outgoing leptons , since the final state muon charges can be signed . given sufficient statistics , a measurement of the angular distribution would demonstrate that the state is indeed spin-1 and not spin-0 or spin-2 .",
    "however , for such a heavy resonance it is unlikely that much further information could be obtained about its couplings and other properties .",
    "in fact the conclusion of several years of @xmath43 analyses@xcite is that coupling information will be essentially impossible to obtain for @xmath43-like resonances with masses in excess of 1 - 2 tev at the lhc due to low statistics .",
    "furthermore , the lineshape of the 4 tev resonance and the drell - yan spectrum anywhere close to the peak will be difficult to measure in detail due to both the limited statistics and energy smearing .",
    "thus we will never know from lhc data alone whether the first kk resonance has been discovered or , instead , some extended gauge model scenario has been realized . to make further progress",
    "we need a lepton collider .",
    "it is well - known that future @xmath49 linear colliders(lc ) operating in the center of mass energy range @xmath50 tev will be sensitive to indirect effects arising from the exchange of new @xmath43 bosons with masses typically 6 - 7 times greater than @xmath51@xcite .",
    "this sensitivity is even greater in the case of kk excitations since towers of both @xmath52 and @xmath1 exist all of which have couplings larger than their sm zero modes .",
    "furthermore , analyses have shown that with enough statistics the couplings of the new @xmath43 to the sm fermions can be extracted@xcite in a rather precise manner , especially when the @xmath43 mass is already approximately known from elsewhere , , the lhc .",
    "( if the @xmath43 mass is not known then measurements at several distinct values of @xmath51 can be used to extract both the mass as well as the corresponding couplings@xcite . ) in the present situation , we imagine that the lhc has discovered and determined the mass of a @xmath43-like resonance in the 4 - 6 tev range .",
    "can the lc tell us anything about this object ?",
    "the obvious step would be to use the lc to extract the couplings of the apparent resonance discovered by the lhc ; we find that it is sufficient for our arguments below to do this solely for the leptonic channels .",
    "the idea is the following : we measure the deviations in the differential cross sections and angular dependent left - right polarization asymmetry , @xmath53 , for the three lepton generations and combine those with @xmath54 polarization data .",
    "assuming lepton universality(which would be observed in the lhc data anyway ) , that the resonance mass is well determined , and that the resonance is an ordinary @xmath43 we perform a fit to the hypothetical @xmath43 coupling to leptons , @xmath55 . to be specific , let us consider the case of only one extra dimension with a 4 tev kk excitation and employ a @xmath56 gev collider with an integrated luminosity of 200 @xmath57 .",
    "the result of performing this fit , including the effects of cuts and initial state radiation , is shown in fig.2 . here",
    "we see that the coupling values are ` well determined ' ( , the size of the @xmath58 cl allowed region we find is quite small ) by the fitting procedure as we would have expected from previous analyses of @xmath43 couplings extractions at linear colliders@xcite .",
    "the only problem with the fit shown in the figure is that the @xmath59 is very large leading to a very small confidence level , , @xmath60 or cl=@xmath61 ! ( we note that this result is not very sensitive to the assumption of @xmath62 beam polarization ; @xmath63 polarization leads to almost identical results . ) for an ordinary @xmath43 it has been shown that fits of much higher quality , based on confidence level values , are obtained by this same procedure .",
    "increasing the integrated luminosity can be seen to only make matters worse .",
    "fig.3 shows the results for the cl following the above approach as we vary both the luminosity and the mass of the first kk excitation at both 500 gev and 1 tev @xmath49 linear colliders . from this figure",
    "we see that the resulting cl is below @xmath64 for a first kk excitation with a mass of 4(5,6 ) tev when the integrated luminosity at the 500 gev collider is 200(500,900)@xmath57 whereas at a 1 tev for excitation masses of 5(6,7 ) tev we require luminosities of 150(300,500)@xmath57 to realize this same cl . barring some unknown systematic effect the only conclusion that one could draw from such bad fits is that the hypothesis of a single @xmath43 , and the existence of no other new physics , is simply _",
    "wrong_. if no other exotic states are observed below the first kk mass at the lhc , such as @xmath65@xcite or leptoquarks@xcite , this result would give very strong indirect evidence that something more unusual that a conventional @xmath43 had been found but _ can not _ prove that this is a kk state .",
    "in order to be completely sure of the nature of the first kk excitation , we must produce it directly at a higher energy lepton collider and sit on and near the peak of the kk resonance . to reach this mass range",
    "will most likely require a muon collider .",
    "the first issue to address is the quality of the degeneracy of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states .",
    "based on the analyses in ref.@xcite we can get an idea of the maximum possible size of this fractional mass shift and we find it to be of order @xmath66 , an infinitesimal quantity for kk masses in the several tev range .",
    "thus even when mixing is included we find that the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states remain very highly degenerate so that even detailed lineshape measurements may not be able to distinguish the @xmath67 composite state from that of a @xmath43 .",
    "we thus must turn to other parameters in order to separate these two cases .",
    "sitting on the resonance there are a very large number of quantities that can be measured : the mass and apparent total width , the peak cross section , various partial widths and asymmetries . from the @xmath1-pole studies at slc and lep , we recall a few important tree - level results which we would expect to apply here as well provided our resonance is a simple @xmath43 .",
    "first , we know that the value of @xmath68 $ ] , as measured on the @xmath1 by sld , does not depend on the fermion flavor of the final state and second , that the relationship @xmath69 holds , where @xmath70 is the polarized forward - backward asymmetry as measured for the @xmath1 at slc and @xmath71 is the usual forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "the above relation is seen to be trivially satisfied on the @xmath1(or on a @xmath43 ) since @xmath72 and @xmath73 . both of these relations",
    "are easily shown to fail in the present case of a ` dual ' resonance though they will hold if only one particle is resonating .",
    "a short exercise shows that in terms of the couplings to @xmath38 , which we will call @xmath74 , and @xmath39 , now called @xmath75 , these same observables can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 labels the final state fermion and we have defined the coupling combinations @xmath78 with @xmath79 being the ratio of the widths of the two kk states , @xmath80 , and the @xmath81 are the appropriate couplings for electrons and fermions @xmath77 . note that when @xmath79 gets either very large or very small we recover the usual ` single resonance ' results . examining these equations we immediately note that @xmath82 is now _ flavor dependent _ and that the relationship between observables is no longer satisfied : @xmath83 which clearly tells us that we are actually producing more than one resonance .",
    "of course we need to verify that these single resonance relations are numerically badly broken before clear experimental signals for more than one resonance can be claimed .",
    "statistics will not be a problem with any reasonable integrated luminosity since we are sitting on a resonance peak and certainly millions of events will be collected . with such large statistics",
    "only a small amount of beam polarization will be needed to obtain useful asymmetries . in principle , to be as model independent as possible in a numerical analysis , we should allow the widths @xmath84 to be greater than or equal to their sm values as such heavy kk states may decay to sm susy partners as well as to presently unknown exotic states .",
    "since the expressions above only depend upon the ratio of widths , we let @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the value obtained assuming that the kk states have only sm decay modes .",
    "we then treat @xmath87 as a free parameter in what follows and explore the range @xmath88 .",
    "note that as we take @xmath89 we recover the limit corresponding to just a @xmath90 being present .",
    "in fig.4 we display the flavor dependence of @xmath82 as a functions of @xmath87 .",
    "note that as @xmath91 the asymmetries vanish since the @xmath38 has only vector - like couplings . in the opposite limit , for extremely large @xmath87 , the @xmath39 couplings dominate and a common value of @xmath92 will be obtained .",
    "it is quite clear , however , that over the range of reasonable values of @xmath87 , @xmath82 is quite obviously flavor dependent .",
    "we also show in fig.4 the correlations between the observables @xmath70 and @xmath93 which would be flavor independent if only a single resonance were present . from the figure",
    "we see that this is clearly not the case .",
    "note that although @xmath87 is an _ a priori _ unknown parameter , once any one of the electroweak observables are measured the value of @xmath87 will be directly determined .",
    "once @xmath87 is fixed , then the values of all of the other asymmetries , as well as the ratios of various partial decay widths , are all completely fixed for the kk resonance with uniquely predicted values .",
    "this means that we can directly test the couplings of this apparent single resonance against what might be expected for a degenerate pair of kk excitations without any ambiguities .    in figs . 5a and",
    "5b we show that although on - resonance measurements of the electroweak observables , being quadratic in the @xmath39 and @xmath38 couplings , will not distinguish between the usual kk scenario and that of the arkani - hamed and schmaltz(as ) ( whose kk couplings to quarks are of opposite sign from the conventional assignments for odd kk levels since quarks and leptons are assumed to be separated by a distance @xmath94 in their scenario ) the data below the peak in the hadronic channel will easily allow such a separation .",
    "the cross section and asymmetries for @xmath95 ( or vice versa ) is , of course , the same in both cases .",
    "such data can be collected by using radiative returns if sufficient luminosity is available .",
    "the combination of on and near resonance measurements will thus completely determine the nature of the resonance .",
    "we note that all of the above analysis will go through essentially unchanged in any qualitative way when we consider the case of the first kk excitation in a theory with more than one extra dimension as is shown in fig.6 . here",
    "we see that the shape of the excitation curves for the @xmath14 case and the @xmath27 models listed in table 1 will clearly allow the number of dimensions and the compactification scheme to be uniquely identified .",
    "the possibility of extra space - like dimensions with accessible physics near the tev scale has recently opened a new window on the possible solutions to the hierarchy problem .",
    "models designed to address this problem make use of our ignorance about gravity , in particular , the fact that gravity has yet to be probed at energy scales much above @xmath96 ev in laboratory experiments .",
    "the prototype scenario in this class of theories is due to arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali(add)@xcite who use the volume associated with large extra dimensions to bring the @xmath18-dimensional planck scale down to a few tev . here",
    "the hierarchy problem is recast into trying to understand the rather large ratio of the tev planck scale to the size of the extra dimensions which may be as large as a fraction of a millimeter .",
    "the phenomenological@xcite implications of this model have been worked out by a large number of authors .",
    "an extrapolation of these analyses to the case of high energy muon colliders shows an enormous reach for this kind of physics .",
    "more recently , randall and sundrum(rs)@xcite have proposed a new scenario wherein the hierarchy is generated by an exponential function of the compactification radius , called a warp factor . unlike the add model , they assume a 5-dimensional non - factorizable geometry , based on a slice of @xmath97 spacetime .",
    "two 3-branes , one being ` visible ' with the other being ` hidden ' , with opposite tensions rigidly reside at @xmath98 orbifold fixed points , taken to be @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the angular coordinate parameterizing the extra dimension .",
    "it is assumed that the extra - dimension bulk is only populated by gravity and that the sm lies on the brane with negative tension .",
    "the solution to einstein s equations for this configuration , maintaining 4-dimensional poincare invariance , is given by the 5-dimensional metric @xmath101 where the greek indices run over ordinary 4-dimensional spacetime , @xmath102 with @xmath103 being the compactification radius of the extra dimension , and @xmath104 . here",
    "@xmath105 is a scale of order the planck mass and relates the 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath106 to the cosmological constant .",
    "examination of the action in the 4-dimensional effective theory in the rs scenario yields the relationship @xmath107 for the reduced effective 4-d planck scale .",
    "assuming that we live on the 3-brane located at @xmath108 , it is found that a field on this brane with the fundamental mass parameter @xmath109 will appear to have the physical mass @xmath110 .",
    "tev scales are thus generated from fundamental scales of order @xmath111 via a geometrical exponential factor and the observed scale hierarchy is reproduced if @xmath112 .",
    "hence , due to the exponential nature of the warp factor , no additional large hierarchies are generated .",
    "a recent analysis@xcite examined the phenomenological implications and constraints on the rs model that arise from the exchange of weak scale towers of gravitons .",
    "there it was shown that the masses of the kk graviton states are given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the roots of @xmath115 , the ordinary bessel function of order 1 .",
    "it is important to note that these roots are _ not _ equally spaced , in contrast to most kk models with one extra dimension , due to the non - factorizable metric .",
    "expanding the graviton field into the kk states one finds the interaction @xmath116 here , @xmath117 is the stress energy tensor on the brane and we see that the zero mode separates from the sum and couples with the usual 4-dimensional strength , @xmath118 ; however , all the massive kk states are only suppressed by @xmath119 , where we find that @xmath120 , which is of order the weak scale .",
    "this model has essentially 2 free parameters which we can take to be the mass of the first kk graviton mode and the ratio @xmath121 ; the later quantity is restricted to be less than unity to maintain the self - consistency of the scenario ( to prevent a radius of curvature smaller than the planck scale in 5 dimensions ) and if it is taken too small another hierarchy is formed . figs.7 and 8",
    "show the cross section and @xmath48 for the process @xmath122 as a function of @xmath51 in the presence of kk graviton resonances for several values of the parameter @xmath123 . for large @xmath123 one",
    "does not see the individual resonance structures ( since the theory is strongly coupled and they are smeared together by their large widths which grow as @xmath124 ) but only a very large shoulder somewhat similar to a contact interaction . for small",
    "@xmath123 one sees the individual resonances with their widths growing rapidly with increasing mass as @xmath125 .",
    "note that for large @xmath51 where graviton exchange dominates the value of @xmath48 is driven to zero .",
    "sitting on any of these kk resonances , in the case of small values of @xmath123 , will immediately reveal the unique quartic angular distribution corresponding to spin-2 graviton exchange for the fermions in the final state @xmath126 .",
    "present data indicates that the masses of kk excitations of the sm gauge bosons must be rather heavy , , @xmath127 tev if @xmath14 .",
    "we have found that :    * with an integrated luminosity of @xmath128 , the lhc will be able to observe kk excitations in the mass range below @xmath129 tev but may not see any kk excitations when @xmath27 since they are likely to be more massive .",
