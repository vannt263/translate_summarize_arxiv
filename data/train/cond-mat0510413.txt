    "activated dynamics of granular materials , such as sand , exhibits a fascinating range of behaviors  @xcite .",
    "for example , sand can behave like a fluid when driven or poured from a container .",
    "when at rest , it adopts a solid state , such as dry sand on a beach . in the limit of slow driving ,",
    "a combination of these behaviors ensue , as recent experiments  @xcite demonstrate .    in these experiments",
    "@xcite , a granular bed of glass beads of various sizes is poured into a wide and deep dish , so that the open surface on top is relatively smooth . objects mounted rigidly on a device that measures the support force are vertically plunged in or withdrawn from the bed .",
    "as the object is extracted , particles displaced by the object behave as a solid , moving up en - masse .",
    "particles slide down intermittently , relaxing into open holes , especially around the object itself . at short times , jamming and avalanching , or stick - slip , motion is prevalent , while over long periods a convective , turbulent motion occurs indicating fluid - like behavior .",
    "apparently similar phenomena arise when an object is plunged slowly into a bed , although the forces on the object are significantly larger for the relatively shallow beds considered .",
    "the obtained data in ref .",
    "@xcite shows various interesting scaling behaviors , regardless of the extraction or plunging of the object .",
    "for instance , the variations of the observed average forces as a function of depth for different object diameters @xmath0 can be collapsed by a simple rescaling of the force with its buoyancy and of the depth with @xmath0 , independent of the grain size in the bed .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that plunging down through such a granular bed would always involve larger forces than withdrawing the same object . on the way down",
    ", the object has to work against force chains  @xcite communicating the effect of the rigid boundary conditions at the bottom ( and sides  @xcite ) of the bed , while on the way up , force chains terminate at the open , force - free boundary at the top of the bed . hence , it comes as a surprise that in the experiment  @xcite the force as a function of the depth of the object within the bed increases with a steeper power - law for withdrawing than for plunging .",
    "this suggests that at large depths ( much larger than attainable in those experiments ) the force of withdrawing will eventually cross - over and exceed the force of plunging .",
    "as the experiment ( and our model here ) shows , an object slowly withdrawn from a granular bed with a two - dimensional geometry has to lift up a bulk of interlocked material whose weight grows like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , with increasing depth @xmath3 ( measured down from the open boundary ) .",
    "in contrast , it appears that a plunging object , failing to displace any bulk of material against the rigid boundary below , descends by _ locally rearranging _ material , for which relevant forces merely increase with @xmath3 in as much as the local pressure in the bed depends on @xmath3 .",
    "accordingly , in the experiment plunging forces increase only slightly more than linear with @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , our model does not allow for the study of plunging , for which the consideration of frictional forces appears essential .",
    "in this report , we propose a simple two - dimensional model for the withdrawal of objects from granular beds .",
    "inspired by the `` tetris '' model  @xcite , it ignores many characteristics of granular materials , such as friction , to drastically simplify simulations .",
    "results show that the simulation model exhibits both fluid and solid behaviors , as well as the characteristic stick - slip motion of granular materials .",
    "additionally , we reproduce the same data collapse found in the withdrawal experiment , with similar scaling exponents .    2.9truein",
    "in this model , dimers cover a link and the two adjacent lattice sites and are placed on a square - lattice that is tilted by @xmath4 with respect to the direction of gravity .",
    "these dimers , once dropped , retain their orientation permanently in the lattice , leaning either right or left .",
    "no two dimers can overlap , neither completely on the link nor partially on any of the adjacent lattice sites .",
    "when pushed or chosen for an update , dimers move according to the rules depicted in fig .",
    "[ update ] .",
    "these minimally irregularly - shaped particles lead to complex , frustrated configurations with many uncovered sites , merely due to the excluded volume effect .",
    "2.5truein    on the computer , we initially place dimers into the lattice , starting from a rigid bottom , row - by - row , in random sequential order within each row to avoid super - rough surfaces generated by purely random deposition  @xcite .",
    "at each site , dimers can initially choose random orientations .",
    "placements forbidden due to the excluded volume are rejected , which leads to the formation of voids .",
    "the system s width , which has periodic boundaries , is always chosen sufficiently large to avoid boundary effects .",
    "once initialized , we insert from the bottom an object spanning a number @xmath0 of lattices spacings . after each upward move ( by one lattice spacing ) of the object ,",
    "the granular bed of dimers is updated , following the rules in fig .",
    "[ update ] .",
    "[ lift ] shows the complete cycle , beginning with the object movement .",
    "starting from the surface of the object , particles are tagged if they need to move up due to a displacement of the object or other particles below them .",
    "this process ends only at some void or , more likely , at the open surface .",
    "the weight of all the tagged particles ( marked green in fig .  [ lift ] ) constitute the force needed to move the object at that time .",
    "after that force is recorded , all tagged particles are moved up in parallel .",
    "then , random sequentially in each row from the bottom to the top , particles are allowed to relax by sliding into available voids below them , according to the rules in fig .",
    "[ update ] .",
    "this relaxation process may have to be repeated , until all particles again have a stable support . at this point",
    ", the object once again moves up and all preceding steps are reiterated .",
    "in fig .  [ liftscal ] we plot the average force on the object , given by the lifted mass , as a function of the depth @xmath3 .",
    "we find data collapse of the average force vs. depth by rescaling with the object diameter @xmath0 in the same way as was found for the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the force varies minutely faster than quadratically with depth , indicating that the object lifts a wedge of bulk material with a slightly outward - curving interface .",
    "we let the location @xmath5 of the interface as a function of the distance @xmath6 from the path of the object ( in two dimensions ) have the functional form of a `` poweriod ''  @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants .",
    "in this case , the mass , the area within poweroid , scales with the depth of the object @xmath10 , with @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ lift ] , the interface seems to be almost linear , @xmath12 , consistent with a quadratic relation , @xmath2 .",
    "the experiments find an exponent of @xmath13 for lifting a long horizontal bar of width @xmath0 , which is comparable to our two - dimensional geometry .",
    "this indicates that the lifted wedge has a more parabolic cross - section , @xmath14 .",
    "it appears that frictional forces , absent in the model , allow steeper overhangs on both sides of the interface between moving and stationary particles .",
    "2.2truein    2.2truein    fluctuations between the forces on the object during its upward motion seem to be entirely uncorrelated , both in the experiments as well as in our simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fluctuations ] we merely show one generic instance of the changes in mass lifted ( relative to the total mass lifted at that point ) between consecutive upward steps  .",
    "both sets of data show the same random characteristics , and the corresponding correlation functions are essentially trivial .",
    "this suggests that the interface between moved and stationary particles fluctuates randomly and without long - term memory between consecutive moves .",
    "the model also exhibits stick - slip behavior without any additional assumptions about friction or other forces .",
    "the irregular shape of the particles permits the creation of voids behind the withdrawing object by jamming the passage of other particles into the wake , as fig .",
    "[ stickslip ] shows .",
    "thereby , the weight resting on the object remains high ( `` stick '' ) until the jam is resolved by moving the object further up and particles can pour in to fill the void ( `` slip '' ) .",
    "this stick - slip behavior occurs throughout a run , creating large fluctuations in the mass lifted ( see fig .",
    "[ fluctuations ] ) .",
    "1.7truein    2.7truein    in addition to measuring the force on the object , we have tracked tracer particles to study the transport of particles during the upward motion of the object in more detail . as a result",
    ", we find fluid - like behavior over these longer periods . as fig .",
    "[ tracer ] indicates , there exists a convective - like motion among the particles .",
    "this convective zone does not seem to penetrate far from the track of the ( slow - moving ) object .",
    "we have introduced a simple model for vertical granular drag and presented some preliminary simulation results which convey the major aspects of granular motion , including the solid , fluid and stick - slip behaviors .",
    "the strength of this model lies in its simplicity . without major assumptions about forces such as friction or electrostatics",
    ", this simulation replicates , to good agreement , experimental data . in particular",
    ", the model reproduces the essential scaling collapse found for the corresponding experiments  @xcite .",
    "future extension of this model could involve the study of fast - moving objects , where the velocity could be tuned by prematurely stopping the updates in the relaxation process .",
    "another interesting application of this model concerns motion of an object at any angle , but only above the horizontal .",
    "essential for the applicability of our current model is that any stress induced by the motion can be relieved at the open surface .",
    "we would like to thank stephan koehler for sharing his time explaining his experiment as well as sharing his data .",
    "tomasz kott would like to thank emory university for its hospitality and the howard hughes medical institute for supporting this research through grant # 52003727 .",
