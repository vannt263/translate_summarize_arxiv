    "one of the greatest challenges faced by string and m theory is that of describing time - dependent singularities , such as occur in cosmology and in black holes .",
    "these singularities signal the catastrophic failure of general relativity at short distances , precisely the pathology that string theory is supposed to cure .",
    "indeed string theory does succeed in removing the divergences present in perturbative quantum gravity about flat spacetime .",
    "string theory is also known to tolerate singularities in certain static backgrounds such as orbifolds and conifolds .",
    "however , studies within string theory thus far have been unable to shed much light on the far more interesting question of the physical resolution of time - dependent singularities .    in this paper",
    "we discuss m theory in one of the simplest possible time - dependent backgrounds  @xcite , a direct product of @xmath2-dimensional flat euclidean space @xmath3 with two dimensional compactified milne space - time , @xmath4 , with line element -dt^2+t^2 d^2 .",
    "[ eq : line ] the compactified coordinate @xmath5 runs from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . as @xmath8 runs from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ,",
    "the compact dimension shrinks away and reappears once more , with rapidity @xmath7 .",
    "analyticity in @xmath8 suggests that this continuation is unique  @xcite .",
    "away from @xmath11 , @xmath4 is locally flat , as can be seen by changing to coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 in which ( [ eq : line ] ) is just @xmath14 .",
    "hence @xmath15 is naturally a solution of any geometrical theory whose field equations are built from the curvature tensor .",
    "however , @xmath15 is nonetheless mathematically singular at @xmath11 because the metric degenerates when the compact dimension disappears .",
    "general relativity can not make sense of this situation since there ceases to be enough cauchy data to determine the future evolution of fields .",
    "in fact , the situation is worse than this : within general relativity , generic perturbations diverge as log@xmath16 as one approaches the singularity  @xcite , signaling the breakdown of perturbation theory and the approach to kasner or mixmaster behavior , according to which the space - time curvature diverges as @xmath17 .",
    "of course , this breakdown of general relativity presents a challenge : can m theory make sense of the singularity at @xmath11 ?",
    "we are interested in what happens in the immediate vicinity of @xmath11 , when the compact dimension approaches , and becomes smaller than , the fundamental membrane tension scale . the key difference between m theory ( or string theory ) and",
    "local field theories such as general relativity is the existence of extended objects including those stretching across compactified dimensions .",
    "such states become very light as the compact dimensions shrink below the fundamental scale .",
    "they are known to play a central role in resolving singularities for example in orbifolds and in topology - changing transitions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very natural to ask what role such states play in big crunch / big bang space - times .    in this paper",
    "we shall show that @xmath0-branes winding uniformly around the compact dimension obey equations , obtained by canonical methods , which are completely regular at @xmath11 .",
    "these methods are naturally invariant under choices of worldvolume coordinates",
    ". therefore we claim that it is possible to unambiguously describe evolution of such states from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , through a cosmological singularity from the point of view of the low energy effective theory .",
    "indeed the space - time we consider corresponds locally to one where two empty , flat , parallel orbifold planes collide , precisely the situation envisaged in recently proposed cosmological models .    hence , the calculations we report are directly relevant to the ekpyrotic  @xcite and cyclic universe  @xcite scenarios , in which passage through a singularity of this type is taken to represent the standard hot big bang . in particular , the equation of state during the dark",
    "energy and contracting phases causes the orbifold planes to be empty , flat , and parallel as they approach to within a string length  @xcite .",
    "this setup makes it natural to split the study of the collision of orbifold planes into a separate analysis of the winding modes , which become light near @xmath11 , and other modes that become heavy there .",
    "this strategy feeds directly into the considerations in this paper .",
    "the physical reason why winding states are well - behaved is easy to understand .",
    "the obvious problem with a space - time such as compactified milne is the blue shifting effect felt by particles which can run around the compact dimension as it shrinks away .",
    "as we shall discuss in detail , winding states wrapping around the compact dimension do not feel any blue shifting effect because there is no physical motion along their length .",
    "instead , as their length disappears , from the point of view of the noncompact dimensions , their effective mass or tension tends to zero but their energy and momentum remain finite .",
    "when such states are quantized the corresponding fields are well - behaved and the field equations are analytic at @xmath11 . in contrast , for bulk , non - winding states , the motion in the @xmath5 direction is physical and it becomes singular as @xmath8 tends to zero . in the quantum field theory of such states",
    ", this behavior results in logarithmic divergences of the fields near @xmath11 , even for the lowest modes of the field which are uniform in @xmath5 _ i.e. , _ the lowest kaluza - klein modes ( see section x and appendix 4 ) .",
    "we are specially interested in the case of m theory , considered as the theory of branes . as the compact dimension becomes small , the winding m2-branes we focus on are the lowest energy states of the theory , and describe a string theory in a certain time - dependent background .",
    "the most remarkable feature of this setup is that the string theory includes a graviton and , hence , describes perturbative gravity near @xmath11 . in this paper , we show these strings , when considered as winding m2-branes , follow smooth evolution ( see section vii ) across the singularity , even though the string frame metric degenerates there . furthermore we show that this good behavior is only seen in a perturbation expansion in the membrane tension , corresponding from the string theory point of view to an expansion in _ inverse powers of @xmath1_. we argue that the two - dimensional nonlinear sigma model describing this situation is renormalizable in such an expansion .",
    "the good behavior of the relevant string theory contrasts sharply with the bad behavior of general relativity .",
    "there is no contradiction , however , because general relativity is only the first approximation to string theory in an expansion in positive powers of @xmath1 .",
    "such an expansion is valid when @xmath8 is much larger than the fundamental membrane scale , but it fails near the singularity where , as mentioned , the theory is regular in the opposite @xmath20 expansion .",
    "the logarithmic divergences of perturbations found using the einstein equations are , thereby , seen to be due to the failure of the @xmath1 expansion , and not of m or string theory _ per se_.    when the m theory dimension is small , the modes of the theory are neatly partitioned into light @xmath5-independent modes and heavy @xmath5-dependent modes .",
    "the former set consists of winding membranes , which describe a string theory including perturbative gravity .",
    "this is the sector within which cosmological perturbations lie , and which will be our prime focus in this paper .",
    "the @xmath5-dependent modes are likely to be harder to describe .",
    "the naive argument that these modes are problematic because they are blue shifted and , hence , infinitely amplified as @xmath21 is suspect because it relies on conventional einstein gravity , here we argue that , close to the brane collision , einstein gravity is a poor approximation and , instead , perturbative gravity is described by the non - singular winding sector .",
    "the latter does not exhibit blue shifting behavior near @xmath11 , so the naive argument does not apply .",
    "witten has argued @xcite that the massive kaluza - klein modes of the eleven - dimensional theory map onto non - perturbative black hole states in the effective string theory . even though these black hole states are likely to be hard to describe in detail , we will explain in section ii why their overall effect is likely to be small .",
    "first , in the cosmological scenarios of interest , the universe enters the regime where perturbative gravity is described by the winding modes ( _ i.e. , _ the branes are close ) with a negligible density of kaluza - klein massive modes .",
    "this suppression is a result of the special equation of state in the contracting phase that precedes this regime  @xcite .",
    "second , the density of black holes quantum produced due to the time - dependent background in the vicinity of the collision is likely to be negligible because they are so massive and so large .    for these reasons ,",
    "we focus at present on the propagation of the perturbative gravity sector near @xmath11 corresponding to the winding m2-brane states . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the compactified milne background metric that describes the collision between orbifold planes in the big crunch / big bang transition .",
    "we also discuss the motivation for the initial conditions that will be assumed in this paper .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian description of @xmath0-branes in curved space is given in section iii and applied to winding modes in the compactified milne background in section iv .",
    "section v discusses the key difference in the hamiltonian description between winding and bulk states that accounts for their different behavior near the big crunch / big bang transition .",
    "section vi is the consideration of a toy model in which winding strings are produced as the branes collide .",
    "the winding modes are described semi - classically , and their quantum production at the bounce is computed .",
    "section vii presents the analogous semi - classical description of winding m2-branes .",
    "although we can not solve the theory exactly , we show the eleven - dimensional theory is well behaved near @xmath11 and explain how the apparent singularity in the dimensionally - reduced string theory is resolved in the membrane picture .",
    "then , section viii makes clear the difference between our calculation , an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath1 , versus einstein gravity , the leading term in an expansion in positive powers of @xmath1 .",
    "this argument is key to explaining why we think the transition is calculable even though it appears to be poorly behaved when described by einstein gravity .",
    "section ix , then , uses euclidean instanton methods to study the quantum production of winding m2-branes ( in analogy to the case of winding strings in section vi ) induced by passage through the singularity , obtaining finite and physically sensible results .",
    "in particular , the resultant density tends to zero as the speed of contraction of the compact dimension is reduced .",
    "we estimate the gravitational back - reaction and show it is small provided @xmath7 , the rapidity of contraction of the compact dimension , is small .    in section",
    "x , we comment on why our m theory setup is better behaved than the lorentzian orbifold case  @xcite considered in some previous investigations of the big crunch / big bang transition .",
    "the fundamental problem with the latter case , we argue , is that perturbative gravity lies within the bulk sector and not the winding sector as far as the compactified milne singularity is concerned .",
    "therefore , it is susceptible to the blueshifting problem mentioned above , rendering the string equations singular .",
    "the @xmath22-dimensional space - time we consider is a direct product of @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space , @xmath3 , and a two - dimensional time - dependent space - time known as compactified milne space - time , or @xmath4 .",
    "the line element for @xmath23 is thus ds^2= -dt^2 + t^2 d^2 + d^2 , 0_0 , - _ 2 ^ -13 _ 0 ^ -13 . [ eq : stringtime2 ] we conclude that for small @xmath7 there are three relevant regimes . in units where the membrane tension @xmath24 is unity , they are as follows . for @xmath25 the description of @xmath26 theory in terms of eleven dimensional einstein gravity should hold .",
    "as @xmath16 falls below @xmath27 , the size of the extra dimension falls below the membrane scale and we go over to the ten dimensional string theory description . in the cosmological scenarios of interest , the incoming state is very smooth  @xcite , hence this state should be well - described by ten dimensional einstein - dilaton gravity , which of course agrees with the eleven dimensional einstein theory reduced in the kaluza - klein fashion .",
    "however , when @xmath16 falls below @xmath28 , the einstein - dilaton description fails and we must employ the fundamental description of strings in order to obtain regular behavior at @xmath11 .",
    "let us consider , then , the relevant string action . as we explained in section iv , for winding m2-branes",
    "a good gauge choice is @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding gauge - fixed worldsheet action was given in ( [ eq : actw ] ) : for @xmath31 this reads _",
    "gf= dd _ ( ^^-_2 ^ 2 _ 0 ^ 2 t^2 x^ x^ ) ) .",
    "[ eq : newact ] where the fields @xmath32 depend on @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this action describes a two dimensional field theory with a quartic interaction .",
    "we confine ourselves to some preliminary remarks about the perturbative behavior of ( [ eq : newact ] ) before proceeding to non - perturbative calculations in the next section . in units where @xmath35 is unity , the action must be dimensionless . from the @xmath36-dimensional point of view , the coordinates @xmath37 have dimensions of inverse mass and @xmath38 has dimensions of mass cubed , so @xmath39 must have dimensions of mass squared . however , the dimensional analysis relevant to the quantization of ( [ eq : newact ] ) considered as a two dimensional field theory is quite different : the fields @xmath37 are dimensionless . from the quartic term",
    "we see that @xmath40 is a dimensionless coupling . suggesting that perturbation theory in @xmath40 should be renormalizable .",
    "the string tension at a time @xmath41 is @xmath42 ; the usual @xmath1 expansion is then an expansion in the regge slope parameter @xmath43 , i.e. in negative powers of @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , the perturbation expansion we are discussing is an _ expansion in inverse powers of @xmath1_.    these considerations point the way to the resolution of an apparent conflict between two facts .",
    "winding m2-brane evolution is as we have seen smooth through @xmath11 .",
    "we expect m2-branes to be described by strings near @xmath11 .",
    "the low energy approximation to string theory is einstein - dilaton gravity . yet , as noted above , in einstein - dilaton gravity , generic perturbations diverge logarithmically with @xmath16 as @xmath8 tends to zero .",
    "the resolution of the paradox is that general relativity is the leading term in an expansion in @xmath1 for the string theory .",
    "as we have shown , however , the good behavior of string theory is only apparent in the opposite expansion , in _ inverse _ powers of @xmath1 .    in order to evolve the incoming state defined at large @xmath16 where general relativity is a good description , through small @xmath16 where string theory is still valid but general relativity fails",
    ", we must match the standard @xmath1 expansion onto the new @xmath44 expansion we have been discussing .",
    "we defer a detailed discussion of this fascinating issue to a future publication .",
    "the action ( [ eq : newact ] ) describes a string with a time - dependent tension , which goes to zero at @xmath11 .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the zero - tension limit of string theory ( see for example @xcite ) , in minkowski space - time . at zero tension",
    "the action is ( [ eq : newact ] ) but without the second term .",
    "this is the action for an infinite number of massless particles with no interactions .",
    "quantum mechanically , there is no central charge and no critical dimension .",
    "however , as the tension is introduced , the usual central charge and critical dimension appear@xcite .",
    "the string theory we are discussing , with action ( [ eq : newact ] ) , is nonlinear and therefore difficult to solve .",
    "we can still make substantial progress on questions of physical interest by employing nonperturbative instanton methods .",
    "one of the most interesting questions is whether one can calculate the quantum production of m2-branes as the universe passes through the big crunch / big bang transition . as we shall now show , this is indeed possible through euclidean instanton techniques .",
    "first , let us reproduce the result obtained in our toy model of winding string production , equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) may be re - interpreted as a time - independent schrodinger equation , with @xmath8 being the coordinate , describing an over - the - barrier wave in a upside - down harmonic potential .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficient is then just the ratio of the reflection coefficient @xmath45 to the transmission coefficient @xmath46 . for large momentum @xmath47",
    ", @xmath45 is exponentially small and @xmath46 is close to unity since the wkb approximation holds . to compute @xmath45",
    "we employ the following approach , described in the book by heading  @xcite .",
    "( for related approximation schemes , applied to string production , see refs .",
    "@xcite . )    .1 in    [ fig : contour ]    the method is to analytically continue the wkb approximate solutions in the complex @xmath8-plane . defining the wkb frequency , @xmath48",
    ", one observes there are zeros at @xmath49 , where the wkb approximation must fail and where the wkb approximate solutions possess branch cuts .",
    "heading shows that one can compute the reflection coefficient by running the branch cut from @xmath50 up the imaginary @xmath8 axis and out along the negative real @xmath8 axis .",
    "then if one continues an incoming wkb solution , defined below the cut , in from @xmath51 , below the branch point at @xmath50 and back out towards @xmath51 just above the cut , it becomes the outgoing reflected wave . in the leading wkb approximation ,",
    "the wave is given by @xmath52 .",
    "continuing this expression along the stated contour , shown in figure 1 , the exponent acquires a real contribution on the parts close to the imaginary axis , where @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the magnitude of the reflection amplitude @xmath45 is given in the first approximation by @xmath54 where the factor of two arises from the two contributions on either side of the axis . with @xmath55 , one",
    "easily sees that the exponent agrees precisely with that in ( [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "a more direct method for getting the exponent in the bogoliubov coefficient is to start not from the field equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) but from the original action for the fundamental string , ( [ eq : string ] ) .",
    "we look for an imaginary - time solution ( _ i.e. , _ an instanton ) corresponding to the wkb continuation described in the previous section .",
    "the gauge - fixed particle hamiltonian was given in ( [ eq : hemp ] ) , as @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding gauge - fixed action is , in first order form , = d ( - p_0 + -h ) , [ eq : stract ] where as usual dots over a variable denote @xmath34 derivatives . before continuing to imaginary time",
    ", it is important to realize that the spatial momentum @xmath57 is conserved ( by translation invariance ) .",
    "hence , all states , and in particular the asymptotic states we want , are labeled by @xmath58 .",
    "we are are interested in the transition amplitude for fixed initial and final @xmath58 , not @xmath59 , and we must use the appropriate action which is not ( [ eq : stract ] ) , but rather = d ( - p_0 - -h ) , [ eq : stractm ] related by an integration by parts .",
    "the @xmath60 term contributes only a phase in the euclidean path integral ( because @xmath58 remains real ) and the @xmath59 integration produces a delta function for overall momentum conservation .",
    "notice that if we instead had used the naive action @xmath61 , we would have obtained a @xmath62 term in the euclidean action of the opposite sign .",
    "similar considerations have been noted elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "now we continue the action ( [ eq : stractm ] ) to imaginary time , setting @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "eliminating @xmath65 , the euclidean action @xmath66 ) is found to be _",
    "d _ e ( 12 ( ^2_e -(_0 t_e)^2 + ^2 ) + i ) .",
    "[ eq : eucac ] where dots now denote derivatives with respect to @xmath67 .",
    "the amplitude we want involves @xmath68 running from @xmath6 to @xmath47 and back again : ( [ eq : eucac ] ) is just the action for a simple harmonic oscillator and the required instanton is @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the corresponding euclidean action is _",
    "e= 2 ^2_0 , [ eq : eucacr ] giving precisely the exponent in ( [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "now we wish to apply this method to calculating the production of winding membrane states , described by the action ( [ eq : newact ] ) . as in the case of analogous calculations of vacuum bubble nucleation within field theory @xcite ,",
    "it is plausible that objects with the greatest symmetry are produced since non - symmetrical deformations will generally yield a larger euclidean action",
    ". therefore one might guess that the dominant production mechanism is the production of circular loops .",
    "let us start by considering this case .",
    "the constraint @xmath71 implies that the plane of such loops must be perpendicular to their center of mass momentum @xmath72 . as in the particle production process previously considered , loops must be produced in pairs carrying equal and opposite momentum .",
    "the hamiltonian for such circular loops is straightforwardly found to be @xmath73 , following the same steps that led to ( [ eq : eucac ] ) , we infer that the appropriate euclidean action is _",

    "this solution has @xmath79 and the euclidean action is found to be _ e= ( 2    @xmath80 ^ 2/(6\\sqrt{2 \\pi})$ ] , a constant of order unity which we shall denote @xmath81 .",

    "the effective string tension when they are produced is @xmath84 .",
    "we have restricted attention so far to the production of circular loops .",
    "it is also important to ask whether long , irregular strings are also copiously produced .",
    "even though such strings would be disfavoured energetically , there is an exponentially large density of available states which could in principle compensate .",
    "an estimate may be made along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , by simply replacing @xmath62 with @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the effective string tension and @xmath87 is the level number of the string excitations .",
    "this picture only makes sense for times greater than the string time , so we use the tension at the string time , @xmath88 . the density of string states scales as @xmath89 hence one should replace ( [ eq : loops ] ) with a sum over @xmath87 : ~_n e^ d^d-1 e^-((^2+_1 n)^34/_1 ^ 34 ) .",

    "as we discuss in detail in appendix 4 , one needs to use the metric on the space of coordinates in order to construct the quantum hamiltonian . in this case , the metric on the space of coordinates is the background metric , ( [ eq : backg ] ) .",
    "the field equation for point particles is then given from ( [ eq : orderh ] ) : fourier transforming with respect to @xmath59 and @xmath5 , it reads + 1 t = -^2 - k_^2 t^2 , [ eq : eoff ] where @xmath127 is quantized in the usual way .",
    "this is the equation studied in earlier work@xcite on quantum field theory on @xmath15 .",
    "the generic solutions of ( [ eq : eoff ] ) behave for small @xmath8 as log  @xmath8 for @xmath128 , or @xmath129 for @xmath130 . in both cases ,",
    "the kinetic energy density @xmath131 diverges as @xmath17 .",
    "similar behavior is found for linearized vector and tensor fields on @xmath15 .",
    "these divergences lead to the breakdown of perturbation theory in classical perturbative gravity , an effect which is plausibly the root cause of the bad behavior of the associated string theory scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "as we have stressed , in the sector of m theory considered as a theory of membranes , describing perturbative gravity , this effect does not occur .",
    "the field equations are regular in the neighbourhood of @xmath11 and there is no associated divergence in the energy density .",
    "with hindsight , one can now see that directly constructing string theory on lorentzian orbifolds sheds little light on the m theory case of interest in the ekpyrotic and cyclic models .",
    "whilst the orbifolding construction provides a global map between incoming and outgoing free fields , it does not avoid the blueshifting effect which such fields generically suffer as they approach @xmath11 , which seems to lead to singular behavior in the interactions ( although ref . @xcite argues that a resummation may cure this problem ) .",
    "an alternate approach involving analytic continuation around @xmath11 has been simultaneously developed , but so far only implemented successfully in linearized cosmological perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "this method may in fact turn out to work even in the m theory context .",
    "the point is that by circumnavigating @xmath11 in the complex @xmath8-plane , maintaining a sufficient distance from the singularity , one may still retain the validity of linear perturbation theory and the use of the einstein equations all the way along the complex time contour .",
    "the principles behind this would be similar to those familiar in the context of wkb matching via analytic continuation .    in any case",
    ", the main point we wish to make is that now that we have what seems like a consistent microscopic theory for perturbative gravity , valid all the way through @xmath11 , we have a reliable foundation for such investigations .",
    "we have herein proposed an m theoretic model for the passage through a cosmological singularity in terms of a collision of orbifold planes in a compactified milne @xmath108 background .",
    "the model begins with two empty , flat , parallel branes a string length apart approaching one another at constant rapidity @xmath7 . with this initial condition",
    ", we have argued that the excitations naturally bifurcate into light winding m2-brane modes , and a set of massive modes including the kaluza - klein massive states .",
    "it is plausible that the massive modes decouple as their mass diverges .",
    "the light modes incorporate perturbative gravity and , hence , describe the space - time throughout the transition .",
    "our finding that they are produced with finite density following dynamical equations that propagate smoothly through the transition supports the idea that this m - theory picture is well - behaved and predictive .",
    "our model also suggests a string theory explanation of what goes wrong with einstein gravity near the singularity : einstein gravity is the leading approximation in an expansion in @xmath1 , but the winding mode picture is a perturbative expansion in @xmath44 .",
    "our considerations have been almost entirely classical or semi - classical , although we believe the canonical approach we have adopted is a good starting point for a full quantum theory .",
    "much remains to be done to fully establish the consistency of the picture we are advocating .",
    "in particular , we need to understand the sigma model in ( [ eq : actnew ] ) , and make sure that it is consistent quantum mechanically in the critical dimension .",
    "second , we need to learn how to match the standard @xmath1 expansion to the @xmath44 expansion which we have argued should be smooth around @xmath11 .",
    "third , we need to incorporate string interactions .",
    "although the vanishing of the string theory coupling around @xmath11 suggests that scattering plays a minor role , the task of fully constructing string perturbation theory in this background remains .",
    "assuming these nontrivial tasks can be completed , can we say something about the significance of this example ?",
    "the most obvious application is to the cyclic and ekpyrotic universe models which motivated these investigations , and which produce precisely the initial conditions required .",
    "as has been argued elsewhere  @xcite , the vicinity of the collision is well - modeled by compactified milne times flat space . within this model , the calculations reported here yield estimates of the reheat temperature immediately after the brane collision i.e. at the beginning of the hot big bang .",
    "furthermore , if our arguments of section viii are correct , they should in principle provide complete matching rules for evolving cosmological perturbations through singularities of the type occurring in cyclic / ekpyrotic models . as we discussed briefly in section x , it is plausible that this matching rule will recover the results obtained earlier for long - wavelength modes by the analytic continuation method  @xcite , although that remains to be demonstrated in detail .",
    "many other questions are raised by our work .",
    "can we extend the treatment to other time - dependent singularities ?",
    "the background considered here , @xmath108 is certainly very special being locally flat .",
    "although the string frame metric is singular , it is conformally flat .",
    "one would like to study more generic string backgrounds corresponding to black holes , or kasner / mixmaster spacetimes in general relativity .",
    "as we have argued , there is no reason to take the latter solutions seriously within m theory since they are only solutions of the low energy effective theory , which fails in the relevant regime .",
    "nevertheless , they presumably have counterparts in m theory , and it remains a challenge to find them .",
    "we would like to believe that by constructing one consistent example , namely m theory on @xmath108 we would be opening the door to an attack on the generic case .",
    "such a program is admittedly ambitious .",
    "however , should it succeed , we believe it would ( and should ) completely change our view of cosmology . if the best theories of gravity allow for a smooth passage through time - dependent singularities , this must profoundly alter our interpretation of the big bang , and of the major conceptual problems of the standard hot big bang cosmology .",

    "<S> we consider a picture in which the transition from a big crunch to a big bang corresponds to the collision of two empty orbifold planes approaching each other at a constant non - relativistic speed in a locally flat background space - time , a situation relevant to recently proposed cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath0-brane states which wind around the extra dimension propagate smoothly and unambiguously across the orbifold plane collision . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we calculate the quantum mechanical production of winding m2-branes extending from one orbifold to the other . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resulting density is finite and that the resulting gravitational back - reaction is small . </S>",
    "<S> these winding states , which include the string theory graviton , can be propagated smoothly across the transition using a perturbative expansion in the membrane tension , an expansion which from the point of view of string theory is an expansion in _ inverse _ powers of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional description of a crunch based on einstein general relativity , involving kasner or mixmaster behavior is misleading , we argue , because general relativity is only the leading order approximation to string theory in an expansion in positive powers of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the m theory setup we argue that interactions should be well - behaved because of the smooth evolution of the fields combined with the fact that the string coupling tends to zero at the crunch . </S>",
    "<S> the production of massive kaluza - klein states should also be exponentially suppressed for small collision speeds . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast this good behavior with that found in previous studies of strings in lorentzian orbifolds . </S>",
