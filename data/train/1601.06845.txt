    "@xcite , we have already presented discussions on the possible decay channels of composite bosons and fermions into final states of jets and leptons in the framework of effective four - fermion operators in high energies . in this article , we focus on the discussions on the possible channels of composite bosons and fermions decaying into the final states of two sm gauge bosons ( diboson channels ) , and/or jets , in connection with the atlas amd cms on going @xmath0 tev experiments . it is shown that the diphoton channel of composite bosons decay should have the largest branching ratio , however other diboson channels should contribute to the invariant mass @xmath11 of possible composite - boson resonance . instead composite fermions decay into a quark(jet ) or a lepton and a composite boson , the latter is an intermediate state , which then decays into two bosons , i.e. , the peculiar jet - diboson or lepton - diboson channel . the kinematic relation of composite boson and fermion decays is thus definitely fixed , so that the theoretical scenario of composite bosons and fermions can be verified or excluded , provided that the diboson channel of composite boson decay and the jet - diboson or ( lepton - diboson ) channel of composite fermion decay can be experimentally verified .    in secs .

    "<S> we briefly recall the previous publications plb1996,2013,2014,2015,npb1997,2000 and prd2000,2001,2016 on the effective field theory of massive ( tev ) composite particles and their sm gauge couplings in the domain of uv - stable fixed point of relevant four - fermion operators , and on the resonant and nonresonant phenomena for experimental searches , in particular the final states of multijets . </S>",
    "<S> we then focus the discussions on the decay and annihilation channels of composite particles into the final states of the sm gauge bosons , leptons and quarks in connection with the on - going searches of the atlas and cms experiments at energy @xmath0 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the rates of composite bosons ( fermions ) produced by lhc @xmath1-collision decaying ( annihilating ) into two gauge bosons @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and give the definite ratios of decay ( annihilation ) rates of different channels . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a composite fermion decays into an elementary fermion and a composite boson , the latter being an intermediate state decays into two gauge bosons , leading to a peculiar kinematics of final states of a jet ( or a lepton ) and two gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> these provide the justification for the verification or falsification of such a theoretical framework beyond the sm . </S>",
    "<S> we also give some speculative discussions on the channels of composite fermions decaying to @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 two boson - tagged jets with quark jets , or to four - quark jets . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at the same tev energy scale , the composite particles can be formed by high - energy sterile neutrino ( dark matter ) collisions , then they decay , leading to an excess of cosmic ray particles in space , producing signals of sm particles in underground . </S>"
