    "double - diffractive processes of the type @xmath7 can significantly extend the physics programme at high energy proton colliders . here",
    "@xmath8 represents a system of invariant mass @xmath8 , and the @xmath9 signs denote the presence of rapidity gaps which separate the system @xmath8 from the products @xmath10 and @xmath11 of proton diffractive dissociation .",
    "such processes allow both novel studies of qcd at very high energies and searches for new physics . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", hadronic processes containing rapidity gaps play a crucial role in determining the asymptotic behaviour of the cross section at high energies . from an experimental viewpoint",
    ", the presence of rapidity gaps provides a clean environment for the identification of a signal . in such events we produce a colour - singlet state @xmath8 which is practically free from soft secondary particles .",
    "double - diffractive _ exclusive _ processes of the type @xmath12 where the protons remain intact , are even better .",
    "they allow the reconstruction of the `` missing '' mass @xmath8 with good resolution , and so provide an ideal way to search for new resonances and threshold behaviour phenomena .",
    "moreover , in exclusive processes with forward protons , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the incoming @xmath13 state satisfies special selection rules , namely it has @xmath14 , and positive @xmath15 and @xmath16 parity .",
    "hence only a subset of resonant states @xmath8 can be produced , in particular @xmath17 ( but not , for example , @xmath18 ) .",
    "furthermore , the selection rules control the threshold behaviour of the production of a pair of heavy particles . for example",
    ", the born cross section for the production of a fermion - antifermion pair is proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fermion velocity , while for scalar particles the threshold behaviour is just @xmath20 .",
    "thus , for instance , in this way we can distinguish between scalar quark , @xmath21 , and gluino , @xmath22 , pair production . also , the selection rules are of crucial importance in suppressing the @xmath1 qcd background when searching for the @xmath23 signal @xcite",
    ".    we may write the cross sections for processes ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : b1 ] ) in the factorized form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cross section for the hard subprocess which produces the system of mass @xmath8 , and @xmath26 is the effective luminosity for production at rapidity @xmath27",
    ". the luminosity @xmath26 may refer to any colourless @xmath28-channel states which transfer energy across the rapidity gaps without radiating secondary particles .",
    "for example , the colourless exchange may be a two - gluon ` hard pomeron ' state , or a phenomenological ` soft ' pomeron , or even a @xmath29 or @xmath30 boson .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive way to estimate the numerical size of the cross sections for all these double - diffractive mechanisms for producing a wide range of heavy systems @xmath8 ( for example , higgs , dijet , @xmath0 and susy particles ) .",
    "first , in section  2 we determine the luminosity for the different double - diffractive production mechanisms .",
    "we present plots which readily give the luminosity as a function of the mass @xmath8 and rapidity @xmath27 of the heavy system , for @xmath31 collider energies @xmath32 and 14  tev .",
    "then in section  3 we give the formulae for , and numerical estimates of , the hard subprocess cross section @xmath25 for the different heavy systems @xmath8 .",
    "armed with this numerical information of @xmath33 and @xmath25 , we can immediately estimate the observable cross sections @xmath34 of a wide variety of different double - diffractive processes at the lhc and the tevatron , see ( [ eq : a2 ] ) .",
    "we consider the following double - diffractive mechanisms .",
    "production of the heavy system    * via the exclusive process @xmath35 , shown in ( [ eq : b1 ] ) , * via the inclusive process @xmath36 , shown in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , * via the inelastic collision of two pomerons .",
    "the three different mechanisms are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "since we are considering the production of a massive system @xmath8 at high collider energy , the luminosity of the first two mechanisms may be calculated from perturbative qcd , using the known parton distributions of the proton .",
    "although the cross section @xmath25 for the hard subprocess is factored off , recall that there may exist specific selection rules for the different configurations .",
    "in particular in the case of exclusive production only the projection with @xmath37 and @xmath38 contributes to @xmath25 .",
    "we need to be careful in interpreting the cross section @xmath25 for the subprocess producing the massive system , @xmath39 .",
    "it corresponds to _ colour singlet _ production .",
    "that is the subprocess amplitude is averaged over the colour indices of the incoming gluons @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the amplitude for the fusion subprocess @xmath43 .",
    "all other colour factors are included in the luminosity .",
    "moreover , in the case of exclusive double - diffractive production , the _ amplitudes _ ( rather than the cross sections ) are averaged over the two _ transverse _ polarisations of the incoming gluons @xmath44 as a consequence , at leading order , we have only @xmath14 production . on the contrary , for inclusive production , the subprocess _",
    "cross section _ is averaged over _ all _ polarisation states of the incoming gluons , as usual .",
    "finally note that for production via soft pomeron - pomeron fusion , the cross section @xmath25 includes the convolution with the parton distributions of the pomeron .",
    "in this section we collect together the formulae necessary to compute the luminosity functions for the processes shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we write the effective luminosities , for producing a system of mass @xmath8 and rapidity @xmath27 , in the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 corresponding to the processes shown in fig .  1 . here",
    "we have integrated over the transverse momenta of the outgoing protons or outgoing proton dissociated systems , according to whether we are considering exclusive or inclusive double diffractive production .",
    "an important ingredient in the calculation of the luminosity is the inclusion of the survival probability of the rapidity gaps to , first , soft rescattering of the interacting protons and , second , to qcd radiation .",
    "the latter , which results in a sudakov - like suppression , is included in the expressions for @xmath47 below .",
    "the soft rescattering effects are symbolically denoted by a factor @xmath48 in ( [ eq : a3 ] ) . in practice , we calculate the effects using a two - channel eikonal . as a consequence ( [ eq : a3 ] ) does not have a factorized form , and @xmath48 should be viewed as the soft survival probability appropriately averaged over the channels @xcite . the value of the survival factor @xmath48 depends on the particular double - diffractive production mechanism , and may be a function of @xmath27 and @xmath49 .      for the exclusive process shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) we have , to single @xmath50 accuracy , @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the @xmath28-slope corresponding to the momentum transfer distributions of the colliding protons @xmath53 where we take ) by an unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath54 which , for a large hard scale @xmath55 , is described by dglap evolution . as a consequence of the strong @xmath56 ordering , the position of the gluons in impact parameter space is frozen , and hence there is no shrinkage of the diffraction cone .",
    "this would mean that the corresponding pomeron trajectory would have zero slope , @xmath57 . therefore we choose a constant @xmath28-slope , @xmath52 , which characterises the @xmath28 dependence of the pomeron - proton vertex . the value @xmath58 is taken from the fit to the soft hadronic data of ref .",
    "this value is consistent with that observed in @xmath59 diffractive production at hera @xcite . ]",
    "the quantities @xmath61 are the generalised ( skewed ) unintegrated gluon densities of the protons .",
    "the skewed effect arises because the screening gluon ( @xmath62 ) carries a much smaller momentum fraction @xmath63 . for small @xmath64",
    "the skewed unintegrated density can be calculated from the conventional integrated gluon @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "however the full prescription is rather complicated .",
    "for this reason it is often convenient to use the simplified form @xcite @xmath66,\\ ] ] which holds to 1020% accuracy .",
    "the factor @xmath67 accounts for the single @xmath68 skewed effect @xcite .",
    "it is found to be about 1.2 at the lhc energy , and 1.4 at the tevatron energy .",
    "the sudakov factor @xmath69 is the survival probability that a gluon with transverse momentum @xmath62 remains untouched in the evolution up to the hard scale @xmath70 @xmath71 \\ : dz \\right ) , \\ ] ] with @xmath72 .",
    "the square root arises in ( [ eq : a6 ] ) because the survival probability is only relevant to the hard gluon .",
    "it is the presence of this sudakov factor which makes the integration in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) infrared stable , and perturbative qcd applicable .",
    "the luminosities @xmath73 calculated from ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and ( [ eq : a3 ] ) for the exclusive double - diffractive production of a system of invariant mass @xmath8 and rapidity @xmath27 are shown by the solid continuous curves , denoted _ excl _ , in figs .  2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "2 shows the dependence of the luminosity on @xmath8 at @xmath74 , and figs .",
    "3 and 4 show the dependence on @xmath27 for produced masses of @xmath75 and @xmath76  gev respectively , at various @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) collider energies .",
    "we use the mrst99 partons @xcite to calculate the unintegrated gluon distributions ( [ eq : a6 ] ) , and we calculate the ` soft ' survival factor @xmath48 using the formalism of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath79 , 0.026 and 0.020 for collider energies @xmath32 and 14  tev respectively .",
    "the luminosity is presented as the number of effective gluon - gluon collisions per @xmath77 interaction . in figs .  2 and 3",
    "we denote it as @xmath80 to indicate that the hard gluons , which interact to form the system @xmath8 , originate within overall colourless ( hard pomeron ) @xmath28-channel exchanges , see fig .",
    "this is precisely the quantity which must be multiplied by the cross section @xmath25 of the @xmath14 , colour - singlet hard subprocess @xmath39 , to form the double - diffractive cross section @xmath34 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 the luminosity decreases with increasing @xmath8 , but grows with the collider energy @xmath81 .",
    "the reason is that there is an increasing number of gluons as @xmath82 becomes smaller , and because for larger @xmath8 the double - logarithmic sudakov suppression ( [ eq : a7 ] ) is stronger due to the higher scale @xmath70 .",
    "exclusive production has by far the cleanest signal .",
    "unfortunately , the luminosity , and hence the predicted event rate , are small . for this reason we consider _ inclusive _ double diffractive production , process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , with less restrictive kinematics due to the dissociation of the incoming protons , see fig .",
    "the cross section can be expressed as exclusive production at the parton - parton level @xmath83 convoluted with the probabilities to find partons @xmath84 in the incoming protons .",
    "the process is shown in fig .  5 , where the probabilities are denoted by the effective parton densities @xmath85 .",
    "at the parton - parton level , ( [ eq : b7 ] ) , the unintegrated gluon distributions in partons @xmath84 may be calculated perturbatively in terms of the non - forward bfkl amplitudes @xmath86 .",
    "this means that we must replace the densities @xmath54 in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is given by ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "the non - forward bfkl amplitudes @xmath89 are of the form @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mean number of gluons emitted , with transverse momenta in the range @xmath92 and rapidities in the interval @xmath93 @xmath94 the remaining factor @xmath95 accounts for the usual bfkl ( single ) logarithms . for rapidity gaps",
    "@xmath96 we have @xmath97 and , for @xmath98 , it is sufficient to retain only the @xmath99 term , which gives @xcite @xmath100 we use this value in our numerical predictions . note that the bfkl amplitudes , which describe elastic parton - parton scattering , already contain the double - logarithmic sudakov suppression which reflects the absence of secondary gluon emission with transverse momenta @xmath101 up to the momentum transfer @xmath102 .",
    "the remainder of the hard suppression factor , which accounts for the absence of emission in the interval @xmath103 , has been incorporated separately in terms of the survival factors @xmath104 .    the dominant ( leading @xmath50 ) contribution to the inclusive amplitude of fig .",
    "1(b ) comes from the asymmetric configuration @xmath98 .",
    "thus the transverse momenta of the two hard active gluons can no longer be approximated by @xmath105 , as they were in the exclusive case in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) @xcite . as a consequence each hard gluon propagator , together with its polarization factor",
    ", can no longer be written as @xmath106 , but must remain @xmath107 . therefore , the factor @xmath108 in the amplitude in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) now becomes @xmath109 . moreover , in the limit @xmath110 we have @xmath111 .",
    "thus , instead of the factor @xmath112 , which came from the @xmath113 integral limited by the proton form factor as in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and ( [ eq : a5 ] ) , we now obtain the logarithmic @xmath114 integrals . here",
    "we have used @xmath115 thus , to compute fig .",
    "5 we must evaluate @xmath116    in this way , we find the luminosity , ( [ eq : a3 ] ) , for the inclusive process of fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .  5 , in which the initial protons dissociate and the system @xmath8 is produced with rapidity gaps @xmath117 and @xmath118 on either side , is , to leading @xmath50 accuracy , expressed in the form @xcite @xmath119 with @xmath41 .",
    "the primed quantities arise because the luminosity is obtained by multiplying the inclusive amplitude by its complex conjugate , as in fig .",
    "the effective parton densities , @xmath120 are integrated from @xmath121 up to 1 .",
    "these limits ensure that no recoil jets in the dissociated states @xmath10 and @xmath11 lie within the rapidity gap intervals @xmath117 and",
    "@xmath118 respectively .    due to the asymmetric configurations of the @xmath28-channel gluons , @xmath122 , we have , besides @xmath93 , a second logarithm @xmath123 in the bfkl evolution . using this double @xmath50 result ( that is setting @xmath124 in ( [ eq : a12 ] ) )",
    ", we may simplify expression ( [ eq : a9 ] ) for @xmath125 .",
    "then we perform the @xmath126 and @xmath127 integrations and find @xmath128 where @xmath129 equals @xmath117 if @xmath130 , but equals @xmath118 when @xmath131 .    the luminosity @xmath73 calculated from ( [ eq : a8 ] ) and ( [ eq : a3 ] ) for inclusive double - diffractive production of a system of mass @xmath8 and rapidity @xmath27",
    "is shown in figs .  2 and 3 , by the thin continuous curves corresponding to two choices of rapidity gaps , namely @xmath132 and , @xmath133 in fig .",
    "again we use mrst99 partons @xcite , to calculate ( [ eq : a10 ] ) .",
    "since we are working at the partonic level , a monte carlo simulation would be required to obtain the precise experimental prediction .",
    "unfortunately , the lower curve for @xmath134 is more relevant , as after hadronization the smaller rapidity gaps with @xmath135 may be hard to identify .",
    "the effective luminosity , that is the number of @xmath13 collisions , is larger for inclusive than exclusive production due to the larger available phase space , since now the transverse momentum of the heavy system @xmath8 is no longer limited by the proton form factor .",
    "moreover partons of larger @xmath102 tend to have large momentum fractions @xmath136 , see ( [ eq : a11 ] ) .",
    "for partons of relatively large @xmath136 we sample mainly the smaller size component of the proton wave function , which in turn has the smaller absorption cross section @xcite .",
    "this leads to a larger ` soft ' survival probability @xmath48 . to be precise we use model ii of ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate @xmath48 . for inclusive production ,",
    "the survival factor @xmath48 depends on the values of @xmath49 and @xmath129 , since these alter the values of @xmath136 sampled .",
    "the inclusive process studied in the previous subsection allowed secondary particles in the proton fragmentation regions , see fig .",
    "an alternative possibility is to detect both elastically scattered protons , but to permit secondaries in the central rapidity interval @xmath137 containing the heavy system , as schematically sketched in fig .",
    "1(c ) . in lowest order",
    "perturbative qcd , this process is described by fig .",
    "6(a ) , which is similar to fig .",
    "1(a ) for exclusive production .",
    "the only difference is that now we have bremsstrahlung associated with the hard subprocess @xmath138 .",
    "therefore we can compute the cross section from the same formula ( [ eq : a4 ] ) , except that the sudakov - like suppression is weaker . now",
    "the @xmath139 upper limit in the @xmath140 integration in ( [ eq : a7 ] ) is specified by @xmath141 clearly the luminosity is larger and increases with @xmath137 , as is seen from the dashed curves in figs .  2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "we label the curves-_inel .",
    "_ results . strictly speaking , therefore , a more precise notation might have been @xmath15-_total _ , to indicate that the ` elastic ' contribution is included . ]",
    "_ to indicate _ central - inelastic _ double - diffractive production of the heavy system , see fig .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , we do not gain much luminosity by allowing extra emission in the central region with @xmath142 .",
    "if we enlarge @xmath137 up to 4 we enhance the luminosity by an order of magnitude , but at a great price , as will now be discussed .",
    "first , it is important to note that for processes of the type of fig .",
    "1(c ) , the mass @xmath8 determined by detection of the forward protons is no longer equal to the mass of the heavy system .",
    "in this subsection we denote the former mass by @xmath143 and the latter by @xmath144 .",
    "we see that @xmath145 due to the presence of secondaries in the central region .",
    "this clearly applies to the process of fig .",
    "6(a ) which we have just discussed , but also to the soft @xmath146 fusion process of fig .  6(b ) .",
    "for these inelastic @xmath146 processes we loose all the advantages of the exclusive process .",
    "the clean central environment of the heavy system is now populated by secondaries .",
    "the mass @xmath144 can therefore no longer be measured by the missing - mass method .",
    "moreover , there is no @xmath14 selection rule to suppress the qcd background .    since the soft pomeron - pomeron fusion process of fig .",
    "6(b ) is at present frequently discussed @xcite , we study it in more detail to confirm that it is indeed not a viable search mechanism . in terms of feynman graphs , fig .",
    "6(b ) corresponds to fig .",
    "6(c ) in which the soft pomerons have been replaced by two - gluon exchange , as originally considered by low @xcite and nussinov @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we see that the cross section for the process in fig .",
    "6(c ) is suppressed by a factor @xmath147 in comparison to that of fig .",
    "6(a ) . in the cross section for fig .",
    "6(b ) where , following ref .",
    "@xcite , the pomerons are treated as real particles with their own parton distributions , the factor is reflected in the small values of the effective pomeron structure functions which are determined phenomenologically from diffractive data .",
    "it therefore may not be quite so surprising when we show below that the soft pomeron - pomeron fusion process of fig .",
    "6(b ) has a _ smaller _ cross section than exclusive double - diffractive production of fig .",
    "the cross section for soft pomeron - pomeron fusion was also recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the luminosity factor for the soft pomeron - pomeron fusion process , shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , is @xmath148 where we assume the donnachie - landshoff parametrization of the elastic @xmath77 amplitude @xcite @xmath149 with @xmath150 and @xmath28 in units of gev@xmath151 .",
    "@xmath152 is the proton form factor and @xmath153  mb .",
    "the mass and rapidity of the produced system are given by @xmath154    for this production mechanism the cross section @xmath25 in ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , which multiplies the luminosity , is the standard inelastic cross section given by the convolution of the parton distributions ( of the pomerons ) @xmath155 with the cross section for the @xmath156 hard subprocess @xmath157 with @xmath158 . to estimate @xmath25 we assume gluon dominance and that @xmath159 for our kinematic domain , which is consistent with the distribution obtained by the h1 collaboration from the analysis of their diffractive data @xcite .",
    "then ( [ eq : c19 ] ) gives @xmath160 where @xmath161 here , to be definite , we have assumed that the heavy system @xmath8 is a higgs boson of mass @xmath144 .",
    "next , it is important to note that @xmath162 for the inelastic subprocess within the soft @xmath146 fusion mechanism of fig .",
    "6(b ) is a factor @xmath163 _ smaller _ than the corresponding @xmath164 for the exclusive process of fig .",
    "recall that this factor arises because the exclusive process proceeds via the _ coherent _ fusion of gluons of different spin and colour , which leads to an enhancement of @xmath165 in comparison with the inclusive process of fig .",
    "6(b ) , see ( [ eq : b2 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , at tevatron energies , after observing the leading outgoing proton and antiproton , the available phase space @xmath166 becomes rather small , @xmath167 . in summary ,",
    "the cross section @xmath25 multiplying the luminosity in ( [ eq : a2 ] ) is a factor of about @xmath168 smaller for production via soft @xmath146 fusion ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) than via the ` clean ' exclusive process of fig .",
    "now from fig .  3 , we see that , for the production of a higgs boson of mass @xmath169  gev , the soft @xmath146 luminosity calculated from ( [ eq : a18 ] ) is only a factor of about 10 larger than the luminosity for exclusive production . in both processes we use the same survival factor",
    "is to compare the data with the theoretical prediction which does not account for the soft rescattering effects .",
    "special care should be taken if this method is used .",
    "if the ` bare ' theoretical cross section is calculated using , for example , only the mechanism of fig .",
    "6(b ) and does not include the more important central inelastic production mechanism of fig .",
    "6(a ) , then @xmath170 data / theory will be overestimated . ]",
    "@xmath48 , which was given at the end of subsection 2.1 .",
    "thus we obtain our advertised result : the expected rate of double - diffractive higgs production at the tevatron in the ` dirty ' environment of inelastic @xmath146 fusion ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) is in fact _ smaller _ than the rate for production by the ` clean ' exclusive process of fig .",
    "1(a ) .    of course",
    ", at lhc energies the available phase space @xmath171 is larger .",
    "recall , from ( [ eq : d19 ] ) , @xmath25 grows as @xmath172 . on the other hand , in going from tevatron to lhc energies ,",
    "the ratio of the exclusive to soft @xmath146 luminosities increases by more than an order of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , due to the growth of gluons at small @xmath82 .",
    "we conclude that there is nothing to be gained by studying the soft @xmath146 fusion mechanism , at least from the point of view of higgs searches .      for completeness",
    "we give the luminosity factors assuming that the rapidity gaps are due to the production of the @xmath173 system via @xmath2 and @xmath3 fusion .",
    "we have @xmath174 where @xmath175 , @xmath176 is the proton mass and @xmath177 .",
    "as the dominant ( logarithmically enhanced ) contribution comes from very small @xmath178 , that is large impact parameters , here we would expect the survival factor @xmath48 to be close to 1 @xcite . indeed , we find this to be the case , as illustrated by the values of @xmath48 that are given in section  3.1.3 for higgs production via @xmath2 fusion .",
    "the @xmath2 luminosity , ( [ eq : a3 ] ) , shown in fig .",
    "2 is calculated , we also include the small contribution from @xmath179 , when we evaluate @xmath180 in ( [ eq : a20 ] ) . ] from @xmath181 , and includes the gap survival factor @xmath48 .",

    "predictions for the @xmath3 luminosity are shown in figs .  3 , 4 and 7 . since @xmath3 fusion can only mediate inclusive production , the missing mass technique can not be used . however , here , the enlargement of the rapidity gaps does not reduce the luminosity as much as it did for @xmath13 fusion .",
    "7 shows the @xmath3 luminosity for @xmath135 and @xmath134 , in comparison with that for conventional inelastic production via @xmath3 fusion for which @xmath188 .",
    "these results should be compared with the results for @xmath13 fusion in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "the upper ( dotted ) curve shows the inelastic luminosity @xmath189 assuming that the @xmath13 pair are in a colour singlet state . if this luminosity is compared with the inclusive luminosity for the production of a @xmath75  gev system with rapidity gaps of @xmath190 on either side , then we loose a factor of @xmath191 at lhc energies , while the corresponding ratio for production via @xmath3 fusion is only 0.02 .",
    "production by @xmath3 fusion is less suppressed with increasing @xmath129 for two reasons .",
    "first , since the @xmath30 bosons originate mainly from valence quarks , that is the component of the proton wave function with the smaller absorption cross section , the soft survival probability of the rapidity gaps , @xmath48 , is larger . secondly ,",
    "as the @xmath30 boson is a colourless object , there is no sudakov suppression due to qcd bremsstrahlung .",
    "selecting double - diffractive events means essentially that we are working with a gluon - gluon collider and @xmath3 fusion processes . ] .",
    "indeed , the luminosities presented in section  2 were given in terms of the numbers of @xmath13 collisions per proton - proton interaction .",
    "as emphasized before , there is an important distinction between exclusive and inclusive double - diffractive production of a heavy system @xmath8 . in _ exclusive _ events the forward protons select a colour singlet , @xmath14 incoming @xmath13 state . in _",
    "inclusive _ events the @xmath14 selection rule is absent .",
    "therefore , to predict the cross section ( or event rate at the collider ) we have to be careful to ensure that we multiply the relevant luminosity by the appropriate @xmath138 subprocess cross section .",
    "recall that the @xmath192 superscript was to indicate that the gluons are mediating a double - diffractive process ( loosely called pomeron - pomeron production ) .    in this section",
    "we give the subprocess cross sections @xmath193 which are relevant to the double - diffractive production of various heavy systems @xmath8 .",
    "the differential form is symbolic .",
    "for example , for the production of a dijet system , with a rapidity gap on either side , we study @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the transverse energy of the jets . in this way we can readily predict the cross sections for double - diffractive production at various collider energies , using @xmath196 see ( [ eq : a2 ] ) .",
    "the expression in brackets is the luminosity calculated in section  2 , which is to be multiplied by the appropriate subprocess cross section , which we enumerate below .",
    "we study in turn , resonance production ( e.g.  higgs , @xmath197 ) , dijet production , @xmath2 production , @xmath0 production , the production of susy particles ( e.g.  @xmath198 ) , and various soft phenomena .      the subprocess cross section for the double - diffractive production of a @xmath17 resonance @xmath199 may be written in terms of its two - gluon partial width @xmath200 the extra factor of @xmath201 arises in inclusive double - diffractive production due to the absence of the @xmath14 selection rule in this case .",
    "it reflects the spin coherence of the _ exclusive _ process where the incoming gluon polarisations are correlated , whereas for _ inclusive _ production , the cross section is averaged over the incoming spins in the usual way , that is @xmath202      in the born approximation , the width @xmath203 in ( [ eq : a24 ] ) is just the lowest order @xmath204 decay width @xmath205 . for higgs production",
    "we include the nlo correction to @xmath206 , using @xmath207 note that ( [ eq : a27 ] ) is not the complete nlo correction to the @xmath208 partial width , since it does not include the contribution from the emission of qcd radiation , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "for a higgs boson of mass @xmath169  gev , we obtain from ( [ eq : a24 ] ) and ( [ eq : a27 ] ) @xmath209 in the intermediate mass range of the higgs , @xmath25 depends weakly on @xmath144 , as @xmath210 largely cancels the @xmath211 factor in ( [ eq : a24 ] ) .",
    "given the subprocess cross section ( [ eq : a28 ] ) and the luminosities of figs .  2 , 3 and 4",
    ", we can readily predict the cross section for double - diffractive higgs production at the lhc and the tevatron . to be specific",
    "let us take @xmath169  gev . then from fig .",
    "3 we have @xmath212 also we see that for higgs production @xmath213 ( lhc ) or 2 ( tevatron ) will allow a quick estimate of the @xmath27 integration . finally multiplying by @xmath25 of ( [ eq : a28 ] ) ( which takes care of the @xmath49 integration ) , we obtain @xmath214 these predictions are consistent with our previous estimates @xcite . the background to this signal for the higgs boson is discussed in section  3.2.3 .",
    "another interesting example is @xmath215 resonance production , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "again @xmath25 is given by ( [ eq : a24 ] ) , with @xcite @xmath216 where we have used the lattice result @xmath217  kev @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath218 as an example , consider @xmath197 production at the tevatron . from fig .",
    "2 we have @xmath219 which combined with ( [ eq : a32 ] ) gives @xmath220 consistent with the predictions of ref .  @xcite .      for completeness",
    "we estimate higgs production by @xmath2 and @xmath3 fusion . for @xmath2 fusion , ( [ eq : a24 ] ) is replaced by @xmath221 the factor of 8 , in place of 2 , arises because for coloured gluons there was an extra factor of @xmath222 due to colour averaging and the absence of the @xmath14 selection rule . for @xmath169  gev",
    "we have @xmath223  kev , and so @xmath224 the @xmath2 luminosity , integrated over @xmath27 , is @xmath225 and @xmath226 at the tevatron and lhc respectively , which leads to the cross sections @xmath227 recall that the @xmath2 luminosity includes the gap survival factor @xmath48 , which we calculate to be 0.75 and 0.9 at tevatron and lhc energies respectively for the production of a higgs of mass @xmath169  gev .",
    "the cross sections ( [ eq : a37 ] ) of the present , more detailed , calculation are lower than previous results which were derived in the leading @xmath50 approximation with @xmath228 @xcite .",
    "note that the strong and electromagnetic contributions to exclusive higgs production ( with rapidity gaps ) have negligible interference , because they occur at quite different values of the impact parameter .",
    "also , it is worth mentioning that the @xmath229 fusion mechanism provides a natural lower limit for the higgs exclusive production rate .    for higgs production via @xmath3 fusion @xmath230 for @xmath169  gev .",
    "the coupling @xmath231 .",
    "of course , @xmath3 fusion only mediates inclusive higgs production .",
    "note that there is almost no interference between the @xmath3 and @xmath80 fusion mechanisms .",
    "recall that the former process produces higgs with high transverse momentum , and as such may give a viable signal @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we select events with rapidity gaps we suppress the qcd @xmath1 background , while paying less price for the gaps in @xmath3 fusion as compared to those in @xmath13 fusion ( as discussed at the end of section 2.4 ) .",
    "the born cross sections , for _ colour - singlet _ production of a dijet system of mass @xmath8 , are ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath232,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath195 is the transverse energy of the jets and @xmath233 .",
    "we choose the scale of @xmath234 to be @xmath235 to be consistent with the convention we have used for the luminosities in section  2 . for @xmath236 we see , that contrary to @xmath17 resonance production ( [ eq : a25 ] ) , @xmath13 production is a factor 2 larger in the inclusive as compared to the exclusive process .",
    "this is the result of averaging over the polarisations of the incoming gluons , ( [ eq : c2 ] ) .",
    "moreover we see that the born cross section ( [ eq : a40 ] ) for exclusive @xmath237 production vanishes as @xmath238 @xcite , which is a consequence of the @xmath239 selection rule for the gluon polarizations @xcite .    rather than working in terms of the subprocess variables @xmath49 and @xmath28 , it is often convenient to use @xmath240 and @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the difference in rapidities of the two outgoing jets .",
    "it turns out that factors in the jacobian cancel , so that we obtain the relatively simple relation @xcite @xmath243 thus the product of the luminosity ( shown in figs",
    ".  2 , 3 and 4 ) and @xmath244 , will give an evaluation of the differential cross section @xmath245 .    the large cross section for exclusive dijet production",
    "provides the first opportunity of experiment to check the double - diffractive predictions , already at the tevatron .",
    "for example , let us calculate the event rate for jets in the domain defined by the intervals @xmath246  gev and @xmath247 . if we integrate ( [ eq : a39 ] ) over these intervals , and multiply by the luminosity @xmath248 appropriate to @xmath249  gev , then we obtain @xmath250 corresponding to jets with @xmath246  gev and @xmath251 , which is in qualitative agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "thus even for a tevatron luminosity of @xmath252 , we estimate there should be 60,000 exclusive events in this particular domain .      there are , of course , uncertainties in our estimates of the cross sections for double - diffractive processes .",
    "first , the calculation of the soft survival factor @xmath48 is based on a simplified two - channel eikonal model @xcite . with the presently available soft diffractive data , these estimates of @xmath48 are as good as possible , but it is hard to guarantee the precision of predictions which rely on soft physics .",
    "secondly recall , from section  2 , that the luminosity was calculated in terms of the unintegrated , skewed gluon distribution @xmath54 , and that @xmath253 .",
    "thus a 20% uncertainty in @xmath54 results in a factor of 2 uncertainty in the luminosity .",
    "we calculated @xmath54 in terms of the conventional gluon distribution obtained from the results of a global parton analysis of deep inelastic and related hard scattering data @xcite .",
    "however the prescription is only justified at leading order and for small @xmath82 @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use an improved formula for @xmath54 @xcite , and as a result the double - diffractive luminosity at tevatron energies become a factor of two larger than in ref .  @xcite has been tested , both by providing a successful description of the data on diffractive vector meson production at hera @xcite and by agreement with the upper bound on diffractive dijet production at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "however in both cases a much lower scale is probed and we did not need precision better than 2030% . ] .",
    "however the same luminosity determines the cross sections for different double - diffractive processes .",
    "thus dijet production , where the cross section is largest , offers an excellent way to monitor the @xmath80 luminosity @xcite .",
    "another application of the large rate of exclusive dijet production is as a gluon factory .",
    "the remarkable purity of the colour - singlet , @xmath14 , di - gluon system provides a unique environment to study high energy gluon jets @xcite .",
    "the large dijet production rate may produce a huge background to the higgs @xmath23 signal .",
    "recall that the cross section for exclusive double - diffractive higgs production was calculated in section  3.1.1 .",
    "in fact , for any @xmath17 resonance the ratio of the exclusive @xmath254 signal to the @xmath13 background is @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the experimental missing - mass resolution , the scale of @xmath234 is @xmath235 and the factor 9.7 comes from imposing a cut @xmath257 in order to improve the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "@xmath258 is the decay angle in the dijet rest frame .",
    "note that the major part of nlo effects and uncertainties in the luminosity cancel in ratio ( [ eq : a45 ] ) .    for @xmath23 ,",
    "the signal - to - qcd background ratio is @xmath259 which is very small @xcite .",
    "fortunately , if we tag the @xmath52 and @xmath260 jets to reject the @xmath13 events , we can strongly suppress the qcd background . recall that the @xmath261 qcd background process is suppressed by colour and spin factors , and by the @xmath14 selection rule . in this way the background is suppressed by an extra factor",
    "@xmath262 however the full suppression is only true in the born approximation .",
    "recall that large angle gluon radiation in the final state violates the @xmath14 selection rule @xcite , so in the @xmath1 qcd background the suppression factor @xmath263 is replaced by @xmath264 .",
    "the final result for the @xmath23 signal - to - background ratio is therefore @xmath265 for a higgs boson of mass @xmath169  gev .      at first sight",
    ", the subprocess @xmath266 appears attractive to serve as an alternative @xmath80 luminosity monitor for the exclusive double - diffractive processes .",
    "however it turns out that the event rate is too small . using the known results production . ] for the qed @xmath267 helicity amplitudes @xcite , we calculate the @xmath14 , parity @xmath268 subprocess cross section to be @xmath269 for @xmath270  gev .",
    "when multiplied by the luminosity at the tevatron of @xmath271 , we obtain , assuming @xmath272 , @xmath273 on the other hand , for the lhc for @xmath274  gev we expect @xmath275 note that for @xmath276  gev the observable rate of standard model exclusive @xmath2 events is expected to be much less than even higgs @xmath277 signal . in comparison to exclusive @xmath278 subprocess , the @xmath266 rate is smaller by a factor of @xmath279 for @xmath280 .    this obvious disadvantage of the standard model exclusive diphoton production can be turned into an attractive advantage for searches at hadronic colliders of signs of the existence of extra dimensions , which for instance appear in theories of low - scale gravity @xcite .",
    "the small background rate , induced by the conventional box diagram contribution , may allow a very sensitive high - mass diphoton probe of the effective scale of quantum gravity effects , @xmath281 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "taking @xmath290 , after multiplying by the double - diffractive inclusive luminosity of @xmath291 ( for @xmath134 ) , we would expect at the lhc @xmath292 which , assuming that @xmath293 is of order 1 , should yield about 10 events , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath294 .",
    "it is quite possible that future tevatron results may increase the existing lower limit on @xmath281 , and hence make a diphoton signature for extra dimensions invisible .    of course",
    ", in the inclusive configuration , there may be some additional background induced by @xmath2 emission off the quark lines in the process where the rapidity gaps are created by colourless @xmath295 @xmath28-channel exchange .",
    "however for gaps with @xmath134 , a preliminary estimate exchange in more detail in the future . ] shows that this quark contribution does not exceed the background contribution coming from the @xmath296 box diagram .",
    "thus the total background should not be greater than about 510% .",
    "the exclusive double - diffractive production of @xmath0 pairs may provide new opportunities for studying top quark physics .",
    "in particular , it offers a novel probe of the qcd dynamics in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the born cross section is given by ( [ eq : a40 ] ) .",
    "due to parity conservation , the @xmath0 pair is produced in a @xmath16-wave state , and so the threshold behaviour goes as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the quark velocity in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "of course , the born cross section is modified by coulomb and top - quark width effects @xcite , but for illustration it is sufficient to neglect these , see our estimates at the end of subsection 3.5.2 .",
    "note that the observation of @xmath0 exclusive production can be used as a template of the ability of the missing mass method to find signals of new physics .",
    "double - diffractive exclusive processes , in principle , provide a unique opportunity to investigate the whole of the strong interaction sector of physics beyond the standard model . as an example , we consider supersymmetry , which is a front - runner in searches for new physics . here",
    "we ignore the current theoretical susy prejudices and assume for illustration , first , that the gluino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the second scenario that we consider is that unstable gluinos and squarks exist with masses close to the current experimental limits .",
    "note that it is difficult to separate gluinos and squarks produced in standard inelastic hadronic collisions .",
    "moreover , gluino studies appear especially promising in @xmath13 collisions since these can not be easily achieved at linear @xmath297 colliders .      in recent publications",
    "@xcite an interesting possibility is discussed that a gluino @xmath22 is the lsp ( or next - to - lsp ) or , to be specific , that it does not decay within the detector .",
    "the allowed mass window is claimed to be 2535  gev .",
    "within such a scenario there should exist a spectrum of @xmath298 bound states ( gluinoballs or gluinonia ) , which may reveal themselves in gluon - gluon collisions .",
    "the orbital angular momentum @xmath299 must be odd in such @xmath80 collisions , due to parity conservation .",
