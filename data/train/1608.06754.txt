    "recent years , the popularization of smart mobile devices and the development of various multimedia services have led to an exponential surge in mobile traffic volume . to alleviate traffic pressure of a traditional cellular cell ( i.e. , macro cell ) ,",
    "small cells are proposed and deployed in hotspots to offload traffic to / from the macro cell base station ( mbs ) .",
    "such two different types of cells form a heterogeneous network ( hetnet ) @xcite .",
    "hetnet increases the network capacity by cell densification with spatial frequency reuse .",
    "it has been proved to be a potential solution to meet the increasing traffic demands in future fifth generation ( 5 g ) cellular networks @xcite .    within a hetnet , use equipments ( ues ) with mixed traffic",
    "usually have different quality of service ( qos ) requirements . in this paper ,",
    "mixed traffic consists of two kinds of traffic , i.e. , best effort ( be ) traffic and soft qos traffic @xcite . without loss of generality ,",
    "consider the qos requirements can be expressed in terms of service rates . in this case , the diversity of the qos requirements results in traffic demand asymmetry between downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) .",
    "moreover , traffic demand asymmetry is time - varying , especially in small cells deployed in hotspots @xcite . in such scenarios , time division duplex ( tdd )",
    "is selected over frequency division duplex ( fdd ) for its inherent ability to handle variation of dl and ul traffic demands @xcite@xcite .",
    "compared with fdd where frequency bands for dl and ul transmissions are statically assigned , tdd can easily allocate the fraction of time dedicated to ul and dl transmissions on a per - frame basis according to the traffic demands , which is referred to as dynamic tdd @xcite@xcite .",
    "dynamic tdd has been considered as a promising technology in future 5 g cellular networks where hetnets with mixed traffic will be widely deployed @xcite@xcite . however , it also faces two major challenges .",
    "consider a two - tier hetnet with co - channel deployment of one macro cell and multiple small cells in hotspots .",
    "first , in the dynamic tdd hetnet , all of the dl and ul transmissions operate within the same spectrum . due to asynchronous configuration among neighboring cells , cross - link interference ,",
    "i.e. , dl - to - ul interference and ul - to - dl interference @xcite , will be brought in . in practical deployment",
    ", mbs employs much more power for transmissions than small cell base stations ( sbss ) in hotspots .",
    "thus , dl - to - ul interference produced by dl transmissions from mbs and ul transmissions to sbs , which can be referred to as mbs - to - sbs interference , is severe and leads to a significant performance degradation in ul transmissions to sbs .",
    "second , traffic demands in small cells deployed in hotspots usually suffer much more fluctuations than that in the macro cell @xcite .",
    "when dynamic tdd is simultaneously operated at mbs and sbss , sbss will require more flexibility in the configuration of ul and dl transmission resources than the mbs .    to overcome the challenges we have just discussed in the dynamic tdd hetnet",
    ", we propose a low power almost blank subframes ( lp - abs ) based resource allocation mechanism .",
    "different from existing work , we consider the scenario under mixed traffic . with lp - abs , mbs will reduce its transmission power when cross - link interference between mbs and sbss occurs .",
    "consequently , mbs - to - sbs interference is alleviated .",
    "moreover , the application of lp - abs brings additional flexibility to combat traffic fluctuations in small cells by employing power allocation at mbs and configuration of ul and dl subframes at sbss . in previous work , almost blank subframes ( abs ) @xcite have been exploited to mitigate mbs - to - sbs interference @xcite .",
    "abs are subframes that contain only common reference signals and the most important cell - specific broadcast information .",
    "mbs schedules abs in the dl direction when the interfered ues in small cells perform ul transmissions to sbss .",
    "thus , severe mbs - to - sbs interference can be suppressed .",
    "however , abs based schemes sacrifice precious transmission opportunities at mbs .",
    "we observe that ues with mixed traffic have different qos requirements in terms of service rates . in practical wireless environments",
    ", ues can endure certain interference as long as their requirements on service rates can be satisfied @xcite .",
    "this observation inspires us to apply lp - abs , instead of abs , at mbs . with lp - abs , rather than blanking",
    ", mbs adopts a proper power reduction in dl transmissions subject to the diverse qos requirements from ues . by doing so",
    ", we can further improve the spectral efficiency in the dynamic tdd hetnet while alleviating mbs - to - sbs interference .",
    "furthermore , during the lp - abs period , sbss can adjust the configuration of ul and dl transmission resources to meet the varying dl / ul traffic demands . at the same time",
    ", mbs can also adjust transmission power in the dl direction based on the traffic conditions in hetnet .",
    "these two adjustment procedures are coupled and can be jointly optimized to exploit the diversity of the qos requirements .",
    "the introduction of lp - abs shall make the resource allocation problem in the dynamic tdd hetnet under mixed traffic more complicated .",
    "two kinds of resources , i.e. , time resources , in forms of subframes , and power , need to be allocated to meet the dl / ul traffic demands .",
    "however , allocation of subframes and power that are coupled with each other should be jointly optimized . in particular ,",
    "the coupling relation in resource allocation is reflected in the following key problems .",
    "first , how many subframes should be allocated for lp - abs operation ?",
    "second , how much power should be used when mbs performs lp - abs .",
    "third , under mixed traffic , how many subframes should be allocated to each ue to meet its dl / ul traffic demands ? to tackle these problems ,",
    "we propose a two - step strategy .",
    "the basic idea is to perform resource allocation at coarse granularity level ( i.e. , bs - level ) first and then in fine granularity level ( i.e. , ue - level ) . by doing so",
    ", the complexity of the resource allocation problem can be adequately reduced .",
    "the main contributions of this research can are summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 ) to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to investigate the resource allocation problem in the dynamic tdd hetnet under mixed traffic . moreover , different from existing work",
    ", we introduce lp - abs to alleviate mbs - to - sbs interference .",
    "the application of lp - abs is able to improve the spectral efficiency and bring additional flexibility to combat traffic fluctuations in small cells .",
    "\\2 ) for the dynamic tdd hetnet , we propose an effective transmission protocol for the macro cell and small cells where each transmission cycle is divided into a normal dl / ul period and a lp - abs period . in order to determine the duration of these two periods , we perform time resource allocation at bs - level by formulating and solving a network capacity maximization problem under dl / ul traffic demands .",
    "\\3 ) considering the nature of mixed traffic , we introduce utility functions to represent the satisfaction levels of traffic flows at ues .",
    "then , based on the results from time resource allocation at bs - level , we formulate the resource allocation problem at ue - level as a network utility maximization ( num ) problem , where the set of subframes allocated to each ue as well as the power used by mbs during the lp - abs period are properly incorporated .",
    "\\4 ) we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the num problem .",
    "the key idea is to decompose the target problem into multiple cell utility maximization problems under given lp - abs power and then find the optimal solution by iteratively allocating the lp - abs power .",
    "each cell utility maximization problem aims at maximizing the sum of utilities for all ues within a cell . we prove the necessary condition of the optimal solution and solve it independently at each bs",
    "furthermore , we also prove that the complexity of the proposed algorithm is polynomial .",
    "numerical results have been obtained to validate the proposed analytical and algorithmic work .",
    "comparing with existing schemes , the proposed algorithm can achieve more network throughput as well as better qos satisfication levels for ues .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces the reviews of the related work in the literature .",
    "section iii presents the system model . the problem formulation and extensive analysis",
    "are illustrated in section iv . besides , a low complexity resource allocation algorithm is designed and given in section iv .",
    "numerical simulation results are presented and discussed in section v. finally , we conclude this paper in section vi .",
    "dynamic tdd has been considered as a promising technology in 5 g cellular networks where hetnets with mixed traffic will be deployed . how to alleviate mbs - to - sbs interference and how to allocate resource under mixed traffic are two challenging problems in dynamic tdd hetnets .",
    "these two problems are related in that the results of resource allocation will affect the mbs - to - sbs interference level and pattern .",
    "there exists some work on the former .",
    "several interference mitigation mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "however , the latter has not been well studied so far .",
    "synchronous configuration among neighbour cells has been widely adopted as an interference mitigation mechanism for tdd hetnets @xcite .",
    "the widely deployed td - lte @xcite systems typically adopted synchronous configuration across the entire network . in @xcite , a cell selection scheme based on dl - ul capacity",
    "was proposed for tdd hetnets , where synchronization was assumed for all transmissions in both directions .",
    "authors in @xcite proposed an optimal backhaul - aware joint ul and dl user association for tdd hetnets , where synchronous operation was adopted to eliminate bs - to - bs and ue - to - ue interference .",
    "besides , in @xcite , mbss and sbss were operated on orthogonal frequency bands .",
    "the cross - link interference was eliminated at the expense of additional scarce spectrum .    in @xcite ,",
    "abs based interference mitigation mechanisms have been introduced for dynamic tdd hetnets . in these mechanisms ,",
    "mbss blank some subframes as abs to avoid severe interference to small cells . in @xcite , mbss and sbss configured",
    "synchronous dl and ul transmissions on non - abs , and sbss applied dynamic tdd on abs .",
    "similarly , in @xcite , mbss and sbss configured synchronous dl transmissions on non - abs .",
    "however , sbss applied dynamic tdd on not only abs , but also subframes where mbss configured ul transmissions .    as discussed above",
    ", synchronous configuration can not adapt to dl and ul traffic asymmetry in hetnets .",
    "besides , the abs based mechanisms sacrifice transmission opportunities at mbs , which will cause a waste of spectral resource . furthermore , resource allocation , especially under mixed traffic , has not been well investigated in dynamic tdd hetnets . in fact , resource allocation and interference alleviation are related and they should be jointly considered .     +",
    "in this paper , the dynamic tdd hetnet shown in fig . [ network_arch ] is considered , where a single mbs located in the center of the cell and @xmath0 sbss are deployed within the range of the macro cell .",
    "we denote the set of all bss by @xmath1 , where index @xmath2 is introduced for the mbs .",

    "the percentages of normal dl subframes , normal ul subframes and lp - abs in each transmission cycle are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .    in order to alleviate severe mbs - to - sbs interference on normal subframes ,",
    "sbss keep synchronous transmissions with the mbs on normal subframes . besides , for the purpose of accommodating dl / ul traffic asymmetry in small cells , each sbs dynamically configures the percentages of dl and ul subframes on lp - abs",

    "long term achievable rate of each ue is considered . when a ue is scheduled on normal ul subframes ,",
    "interference sources may change with scheduling cycles due to scheduling dynamics @xcite .",

    "is directly determined by the spectral efficiency .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the percentages of normal / lp - abs subframes in a transmission cycle allocated to ue @xmath19 for dl / ul transmissions .",

    "generally , traffic flows can be divided in two types , i.e. , be traffic flows and soft qos traffic flows @xcite .",
    "utility functions have been widely applied to model the satisfaction levels of traffic flows @xcite .",
    "the be traffic flows are rather tolerant of delay and can adapt to the allocated resource .",
    "the utility function of a be traffic flow is usually defined as a concave function of its service rate .",
    "however , the soft qos traffic flows have intrinsic service rate requirements . when the service rate obtained by a traffic flow is less than the critical value for its service rate requirement",
    ", it will have a high - priority for resource .",
    "otherwise , its priority for resource is low .",
    "usually , the utility function of a soft qos traffic flow is defined as a sigmoid function of its service rate .",
    "we define the utility functions for a soft qos traffic flow and a be traffic flow as follows : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 affect the slopes of the curves , @xmath43 is the service rate , and @xmath44 is the service rate requirement of soft qos traffic .",
    "similar utility functions have been adopted in @xcite .",
    "the derivative of a utility function @xmath45 is called as marginal utility function .",
    "we assume that each ue can generate at most one dl and one ul traffic flow , and traffic flows are generated independently in dl and ul directions .",

    "furthermore , we denote the dl traffic flows and ul traffic flows accommodated by bs @xmath5 by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the introduction of lp - abs makes the resource allocation problem in the dynamic tdd hetnet under mixed traffic complicated . to tackle such problem , we first perform bs - level resource allocation to determine the percentages of different types of subframes .",
    "then , based on the results of the bs - level resource allocation , we formulate the resource allocation problem at ue - level as a num problem .",
    "the problem is non - convex and is complicated to solve directly .",

    "fortunately , each cell utility maximization problem can be solved through a method of two stage decomposition , which is based on the necessary condition of its optimal solution .",
    "finally , a resource allocation algorithm with polynomial complexity is designed .",
    "the percentages of different types of subframes will affect the resource budgets of each bs for its dl and ul transmissions .",
    "thus , such percentages should be determined before we consider resource allocation under mixed traffic .",
    "due to numerous associated ues per macro cell , the aggregated macro cell traffic dynamics can be averaged out @xcite . thus , mbss usually adopt a uniform and quasi - static configuration of dl / ul subframes and abs periods .",
    "besides , in our lp - abs mechanism , each sbs keeps synchronous with the mbs on normal subframes , and applies dynamic tdd on lp - abs .",

    "we assume that at most @xmath53 subframes can be configured as lp - abs .",
    "hence , @xmath54 .",
    "the required resource in each link direction is related with the traffic load , namely the number of traffic flows . besides , to achieve a required rate requirement ,",
    "the required resource is inverse to the spectral efficiency .",
    "based on the above considerations , we define the ratio of normal dl subframes to normal ul subframes as @xmath55 since @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be further expressed as @xmath59 @xmath60    the average capacity of the mbs can be evaluated as @xmath61 and the average capacity of sbs @xmath5 can be evaluated as @xmath62 in the above evaluation , time - slots are equally allocated to traffic flows . therefore , @xmath63 can be set as @xmath64 which can result in the highest average system capacity . besides , @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be set according to eqs .",

    "we formulate a num problem to perform ue - level resource allocation , through configuring @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the num problem can be expressed as follows : @xmath67 where the goal is to maximize the total utilities for all traffic flows in the tdd hetnet , @xmath68 is the utility of @xmath19th dl traffic flow with service rate @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the utility of @xmath27th ul traffic flow with service rate @xmath71",
    ". the utility function @xmath72 is decided by the traffic type of flow @xmath73 .",
    "the resource budget is based on the results of the bs - level resource allocation .",
    "problem @xmath74 is a non - convex problem , and is complicated to solve directly . since @xmath65 is a one - dimension variable , we can first fix @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath74 can be divided into @xmath50 independent subproblems , each of which is a cell utility maximization problem aiming to maximize the sum of utilities for ues in a cell .",
    "the utility for a ue is the sum of utilities for its traffic flows . in this paper",
    ", we consider the cell covered by bs @xmath5 , and formulate the cell utility maximization problem as follows : @xmath75 in problem @xmath76 , the optimization variable is @xmath77 .",
    "constraints @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are resource budget constraints of bs @xmath5 , and constraint @xmath81 means that the amount of resource allocated to traffic flow @xmath19 should not be negative . in constraint @xmath81 and the following content , @xmath82`n',`l'@xmath83 and @xmath84`d',`u'@xmath83 .",

    "this is due to the fact that the interference from sbss dl to mbs s ul will also severely degrade the system performance .",
    "such interference does not exist in the other mechanisms except the um - abs mechanism .",

    "[ fig3](b ) , our proposed mechanism , the eicic mechanism and the synchronous mechanism will result in similar ul performance , which is far better than that of the um - abs mechanism .",
    "the superiority of our proposed mechanism is due to that severe mbs - to - sbs interference is alleviated and enough resources are reserved for dl and ul transmissions .",
    "it should be noted that there exist significant performance differences in the dl and ul directions for the um - abs mechanism .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained as follows . in the um - abs mechanism ,",
    "dl traffic flows have higher priority to be served due to higher spectral efficiencies , and there is no subframes are reserved for ul transmissions in each sbs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we evaluate the performance of different kinds of traffic flows when mixed traffic flows exist . in this simulation , a total of @xmath240 ues are distributed in the network .",
    "half of the ues generate soft qos traffic flows in both dl and ul directions , while the other ues generate be traffic flows in both link directions . when the rate requirement of sort qos traffic flows , @xmath44 , increases from @xmath241 mbps to @xmath199 mbps , the average throughput of be flows decreases quite slowly , especially in the ul direction .",
    "however , the average rate violate probability of soft qos flows keeps almost zero as @xmath44 increases in the above range .",
    "this is due to the fact that the proposed resource allocation algorithm gives higher priority to soft qos traffic flows .",
    "hence , when applying the proposed resource allocation scheme , the be traffic flows will sacrifice their throughput to guarantee the qos requirements of soft qos traffic flows .",
    "when @xmath44 is large enough , performance of soft qos traffic flows also degrades because of the resource budget is limited .",
