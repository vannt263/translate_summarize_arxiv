    "the study of timelike and null geodesics is an adequate way to visualize the main features of a spacetime .",
    "the paths of freely moving particles and photons in the four - dimensional schwarzschild metric is the key to understand various important physical phenomena : planetary motions , gravitational lensing , radar delay , etc .",
    "the three - dimensional black hole solution was reported in @xcite ( btz solution here after ) .",
    "this solution is a spacetime of constant negative curvature , but it differs from anti - de sitter ( ads ) space in its global properties ; it is obtained from ads space through identifications by means of a discrete subgroup of its isometry group @xmath0 @xcite . here",
    "we attempt a complete review of the motion of massive and massless test particles in the btz black hole .",
    "the first study of geodesics around this black hole was done in @xcite . in order to obtain the equations of motion for massive particle ,",
    "these authors use the hamilton - jacobi formalism .",
    "however , the simplicity of this lower dimensional model makes the use of that method unnecessary ; the symmetries of the btz solution enables us to derive directly the equations for timelike and also null geodesics .",
    "exact solutions can be found for the timelike geodesic equations , not only for extreme values of angular momemtum of the black hole as in @xcite , but also for all cases .",
    "moreover , a different interpretation about the oscillatory character of radial timelike solution is given using the penrose diagram .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the section [ geoeq ] is devoted to derive the geodesic equations .",
    "these are easy obtained using the constants of motion associated to the two killing vectors and the normalization condition for the tangent to geodesic curves .    in the section [ sol ]",
    "we first solve the radial equation and bounds for radial motion are determined . from this , we conclude that the rotating black hole is a geodesically complete spacetime .",
    "moreover , the complete geodesics allow the passage from one exterior black hole spacetime to another .",
    "an explanation based on penrose diagram is given .",
    "we also note that while massive particles always fall into the event horizon and no stable orbits are possible @xcite , massless particles can escape .",
    "this important issue makes the analogy between this three - dimensional model and its four - dimensional counterpart more tight : thermodynamic phenomena ( hawking radiation ) as well as energy extraction from a rotating black hole ( penrose process ) are possible . at last , in this section ,",
    "the remaining geodesic equations are integrated and their solutions are tabulated together with the radial bounds .",
    "it is possible to analyze , in a direct way , the main geodesic features by defining an _ effective potential _ @xcite .",
    "we present this analysis in the section [ eff ] . in @xcite ,",
    "only one of the two possible solutions for the effective potential was discussed .",
    "the study of both solutions is necessary , for instance , to understand the penrose process and to determine all the accesible regions for test particles .",
    "an analysis of dragging of inertial frames is also included .    at the last section ,",
    "we summarize ours results and discuss briefly the charged black hole .",
    "the action considered in @xcite is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a surface term , and the radius of curvature @xmath3 provides the length scale necessary in order to have a horizon ( in @xmath4 dimensions the mass is dimensionless , and @xmath5 is the cosmological constant ) .",
    "the einstein equations are solved by the black hole field @xmath6 where the squared lapse @xmath7 and the angular shift @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the constant of integration @xmath13 is the conserved charge associated with asymptotic invariance under time displacements ( mass ) and @xmath14 is that associated with rotational invariance ( angular momemtum ) .",
    "the lapse function vanishes for two values of @xmath15 given by @xmath16^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{horz}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the black - hole horizon ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the surface of infinite redshift is given by the relation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "these three values obey the inequality @xmath22 .",
    "the killing vectors associated to the btz metric are two @xcite , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the constants of motion along the geodesic are @xmath25 \\left ( { dt \\over d \\lambda } \\right )   + { j \\over 2 } \\left ( { d \\phi \\over d \\lambda } \\right ) , \\label{e}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 denotes the static killing vector , and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rotational killing vector and @xmath29 is the tangent to a curve parameterized by @xmath30 , which is normalized by the condition @xmath31 where @xmath32 is 1 for timelike geodesic and 0 for null geodesics .",
    "the constant e can not be interpreted as the local energy of the particle at infinity since the black - hole field is not asymptotically flat .",
    "making the following re - scalings , @xmath33 and using ( [ e ] ) , ( [ l ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) , we obtain the geodesic equations ( in what follows we will omit the caret on the variables ) : @xmath34 where dot means   @xmath35 .    equations ( [ radial ] ) to ( [ td ] ) describe the motion of test particles in 2 + 1 black - hole background .",
    "from these equations we will obtain the orbits for massless and massive particles and the effective radial potential .",
    "the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) can be integrated directly .",
    "the solution for timelike geodesics ( @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 , \\label{rl}\\ ] ] and for null geodesics ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ rl ] ) that there always exist a finite upper bound @xmath43 for the radial coordinate , which verifies @xmath44 .",
    "thus , massive particles can not escape from the black hole .",
    "this inequality can be seen as follows : replacing @xmath45 by @xmath46 , ( [ radial ] ) reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 it is easy to see that the right hand side of ( [ ru ] ) has two real roots for @xmath49 , one positive , @xmath50 , and the other negative , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , @xmath52 is real only for @xmath53 , this implies that @xmath54 since @xmath50 is positive .",
    "we also note from ( [ radial ] ) that there is a lower bound ( @xmath55 ) different from zero if @xmath56 similarly , replacing @xmath45 by @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ radial ] ) , we conclude that the lower bound verifies @xmath58 .",
    "if the conditions ( [ cond ] ) are not satisfied , timelike geodesics terminate at the singularity @xmath59 .",
    "hence , this spacetime is timelike geodesically complete , _",
    "i.e. _ , all timelike geodesics , with the exception of those which terminate at the singularity , have infinite affine lengths both in the past and future directions . a necessary condition for @xmath60",
    "is @xmath61 , hence all the massive particles hit the singularity in the spinless black hole .    in the same way , we observe from ( [ rln ] ) that this spacetime is also null geodesically complete provided that @xmath14 does nt vanish .",
    "hence the rotating solution is geodesically complete .",
    "unlike the case @xmath36 , for null geodesics @xmath43 can be infinite .",
    "this occurs if @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "thus , massless particles can escape from the black hole .",
    "another remarkable feature of the massless case is the existence of circular orbits of any radius .",
    "this occurs if @xmath64 and @xmath65 vanish simultaneously which corresponds to set @xmath66 with @xmath67 ( extreme black hole ) .",
    "the same condition allows a circular timelike geodesic @xcite , but its radius is just the horizon .    in order to solve the geodesic equations ( [ phid ] ) and ( [ td ] ) , we consider three cases , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the solutions for @xmath70 and @xmath71 are shown in table [ table1 ] and the radial bounds in table [ table2 ] .",
    "the trajectories of massless and massive particles are drawn in the figs .",
    "[ o1 ] and [ o2 ] .",
    "the radial coordinate for timelike geodesic is a periodic function of the affine parameter @xmath30 ( [ rl ] ) .",
    "the bounds for this motion are higher and lower than the outer and inner horizons respectively",
    ". one can understand this behavior using the penrose diagram for the rotating black hole @xcite , that we include in the fig .",
    "[ pd ] . the diagram is formed by an infinite sequence of regions i @xmath72 , ii @xmath73 and iii @xmath74 .",
    "we see that the timelike geodesic @xmath75 that begin at a point in region i can cross @xmath17 and @xmath76 and hits the singularity .",
    "however , the geodesic @xmath77 skips the singularity , crossing @xmath17 and @xmath76 infinitely many times .",
    "it is essentially a consequence of extending maximally the 2 + 1 spacetime and of the timelike character of the singularity , as shown in the fig .",
    "notice from the expression for the @xmath71 coordinate given in table [ table1 ] , any radiation emitted by a particle crossing @xmath17 , will be infinitely red - shifted to an external observer at i , and infinitely blue - shifted when crossing @xmath76 .",
    "the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) is a quadratic function of @xmath78 , and can be written as @xmath79 where the roots @xmath80 are @xmath81 both roots coincide at the event horizon .",
    "it is straightforward , but long , to show that for timelike geodesics @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) is a monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) function in region i ; this implies that there are no stable orbits in that region .",
    "we also see that it is not possible to define the effective potential in region ii . for @xmath38 , @xmath84 tends asymptotically to @xmath85 , except for the extreme black hole . in that case ,",
    "@xmath86 , and the effective potential has one constant branch allowing a circular orbit , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sol ] .      in fig .",
    "[ figeff1 ] the effective potentials for @xmath87 , @xmath88 are shown .",
    "the case @xmath89 corresponds to an ads space ; bound orbits are allowed .",
    "the vacuum state of the black - hole configuration is obtained for @xmath90 , ( @xmath91 ) . in this case",
    "all particles fall to the origin .",
    "[ figeff2 ] shows the effective potentials for null geodesics .",
    "we note that in the cases @xmath92 massless particles with @xmath93 can escape from the black hole .",
    "moreover , these potentials have a similar form to those for massive particles with zero angular momentum in the four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the effective potentials for massive and massless particles are shown in figures [ figeff3 ] and [ figeff4 ] .",
    "as in the case with @xmath68 , only massless particles can escape from the black hole .",
    "when @xmath94 only test particles with @xmath95 have positive local energy measured in a locally nonrotating frame ( lnrf ) . nevertheless , when @xmath96 particles with positive energy in the lnrf can have @xmath97 .",
    "these negative energy state exist in the ergoregion and enables a penrose process as in the four - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as massive particles can not escape from the black hole , energy extraction is only possible with massless particles .",
    "when @xmath14 is different from zero , the inertial frames are dragged with angular velocity @xmath98 given by @xmath99 in the four dimensional kerr black hole the angular velocity of the frame dragging depend on mass , has the same sign as @xmath14 and it falls off for large @xmath15 as @xmath100 .",
    "in this article we have solved exactly the timelike and null geodesic equations for the 2 + 1 black hole .",
    "the solutions reflect the singularities of coordinates at the horizons as can be seen from table [ table1 ] and fig .",
    "we show that only the rotating black hole is geodesically complete .",
    "the spacelike character of the singularity at @xmath59 , however , makes the spinless black hole geodesically incomplete .",
    "since massive particles can not escape from black hole , the penrose process can take place with massless particles only .",
    "the metric of the charged 2 + 1 black hole @xcite is obtained by performing the change @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the electric charge of black hole and @xmath103 is a constant . in this case",
    "we can have two , one or no horizons @xcite and then the effective potential could have local minima and produce a very different behavior for test particles .",
    "therefore , the charged case requires further study in order to reveal its geodesic structure .",
