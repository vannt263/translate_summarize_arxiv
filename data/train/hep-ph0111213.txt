    "several physics subjects of interest require a correct description of low mass quark - antiquark systems . in @xmath1 processes",
    ", initial state radiation can bring back the mass of the outgoing quark pair near its production threshold , giving rise to topologies with an energetic photon and a collimated hadronic system .",
    "such events can for example be used to extract a measurement of the hadronic cross - section at the effective center - of - mass energy ( and the ratio r of hadronic to pointlike muonic cross - sections ) @xcite , or represent a background to searches for physics beyond the standard model , such as radiative decays of intermediate vector bosons .    in neutral - current @xmath2 processes , low - mass quark pairs give again access to hadronized virtual photons .",
    "such events are interesting in their own right ( they have been studied by the lep experiments at lep1 @xcite , and the corresponding cross - section is measured by the delphi experiment at lep2 @xcite ) , but can also represent a background to new particle searches , of which low mass higgs boson searches are an example .",
    "current two- and four - fermion generators are not adapted to these kinds of studies .",
    "a first point is that the string model @xcite , upon which the pythia program @xcite relies to simulate the hadronization of parton systems , describes the data well at high energy , but is expected to break down below about 2 gev .",
    "secondly , computations of amplitudes generally make use of state - of - the - art knowledge of electroweak corrections and include a first order qcd term , but ignore non - perturbative corrections to vertices involving a light @xmath3 pair .",
    "in other words , diquark systems are generated with distorted mass distributions in the low mass region , and are hadronized unrealistically .",
    "low mass quark - antiquark pairs appearing in @xmath0 annihilations most often involve a coupling to a virtual photon .",
    "this suggests using experimental data on @xmath4 a low energy , namely the r - ratio and measurements of exclusive final states cross - sections , to solve the problem .",
    "the mass spectrum and hadronization aspects are described in turn in the next two sections .",
    "although it is not the main subject of this report , some results for two- and four - fermion processes are summarized in the third section .",
    "the code location is given in the last section .",
    "the task of implementing non - perturbative qcd corrections to @xmath3 differential cross - sections was first attempted in the framework of the four - fermion generator fermisv @xcite .",
    "the present method is similar and improves on a few shortcomings : the integration of the @xmath3 are spectra are improved using proper monte - carlo techniques ; most importantly , recent data in the charm resonance region are used in order to obtain a good description of this mass range .",
    "with qcd turned off , the cross - section for quark pair production through a virtual photon can be written ( in a symbolic way ) : @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are just charge , colour and threshold factors , already taken into account in generators , and @xmath8 is the total parton level r - ratio .",
    "we now consider qcd effects , and write similarly :    @xmath9    with @xmath10",
    ".the above lines express that for a given quark flavour q , a qcd - improved description can be implemented by multiplying the parton level matrix elements by a factor @xmath11 , representing the contribution of quark flavour q to the experimental r - ratio , with charge , colour and threshold factors divided out .",
    "cross - sections of processes containing a @xmath3 pair will thus be computed as    @xmath12    with @xmath13 the parton level matrix elements , and @xmath11 evaluated at the @xmath3 mass .",
    "the parametrizaton of r includes the contributions from all @xmath14 resonances up to the @xmath15 , with parameters taken from @xcite .",
    "intuitively ( and as in @xcite ) , the @xmath16 s and @xmath17 s are attributed to the u- and d - quarks ( @xmath18 , entered in the definitions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) ; the @xmath21 s , the @xmath22 s and the @xmath23 s are attributed to s- , c- and b - quarks ( included in @xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath26 ) respectively .",
    "the continuum is parametrized by simple functions satisfying partonic boundary conditions , with parameters adjusted in the threshold regions so that the available data @xcite are correctly reproduced . at present ,",
    "one such function is defined for u- and d - quarks , one for s - quarks , and one for c - quarks .",
    "since the currently available data do not allow a detailed representation of the upsilon resonance region , the continuum from b - quarks is represented by a step function at the b - meson threshold .",
    "finally , the continuum parametrizations include an overall second order perturbative qcd correction factor .",
    "the running of the strong coupling constant is computed at second order , and @xmath27 is set so as to reproduce the world - averaged @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the implementation used is taken from @xcite .",
    "the resulting parametrization of the r - ratio is illustrated in figure [ rparam ] .",
    "the r function being very accidented , special attention has to be paid to its monte - carlo sampling .",
    "exploration of all narrow peaks is performed using iterative dividing of the integration range . in a first step ,",
    "the full range is divided in a number of sub - intervals , the borders of which are set on the ( a priori known ) peaks of the resonances .",
    "the interval contributing most to the integral is then divided into two equal sub - intervals .",
    "this process is iterated and fine granularity is obtained by requiring a large number of intervals .",
    "after completion of the initialization phase , drawing intervals at random ( in proportion to their contribution to the total integral ) then ensures correct population of all the peaks .",
    "the program implementing this algorithm and used for our purpose , vesko , was first described in @xcite .",
    "it was modified to be able to take into account the positions of a priori known peaks in the distributions , and to handle several distributions simultaneously .",
    "the above procedure is valid only if the final state quark pair is genuinely coupled to a virtual photon .",
    "therefore , this method should not be applied to the @xmath29 process , unless a kinematic region is selected where the multi - peripheral ( mostly @xmath30-@xmath30 ) diagrams have negligible contribution and interference with the other diagrams .",
    "other complications appear for final states with four quarks . in principle",
    ", one @xmath31 factor should be present for every pair of identical quarks , but there are cases where care should be taken . for example , in the @xmath32 final state and if all quarks have same colour , one should evaluate whether charged current diagrams ( @xmath18 , ww production ) or neutral current diagrams ( z/@xmath33 z/@xmath33 ) dominate the total amplitude , depending on momentum configurations .",
    "similarly , in final states with four identical quarks ( of same colour ) , the `` pairing '' which dominates the total amplitude has to be determined , and the @xmath31 factors should be evaluated at the masses of the connected quark pairs .    on the contrary , the @xmath1 process is unambiguous .",
    "having decided on the @xmath3 mass spectrum in the resonance region , it remains to be determined how every individual event should behave in the detector . as a function of the mass of the quark pair , it has to be decided whether we it can be treated as a resonance of known decay properties , and if not , if the string or cluster fragmentation algorithms available in pythia will work . in the first case ,",
    "the quark pair is replaced by the corresponding resonance in the pythia event record , and it is decayed by a subsequent call to the hadronization routine . in the second case , it is assumed that above a mass of 2 gev , string hadronization is convenient , except in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 threshold regions where cluster hadronization correctly takes over .    since the lowest mass region is dominated by the @xmath16 , we are left with a mass window between @xmath36 and 2 gev , open to u- , d- , and s - quarks , where new input is needed .",
    "this input can be taken from experiment , since the first hadronic final states in @xmath37 collisions have been extensively studied in the seventies and eighties .",
    "data on the following exclusive non - resonant cross - sections @xcite were compiled for this purpose :    * @xmath38 , * @xmath39 , * @xmath40 , * @xmath41 , * @xmath42 , * @xmath43 + cc , * @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 final state has never been measured due to experimental difficulties related to @xmath46 detection , but was assumed to be equal to the @xmath47 cross - section .",
    "[ br ]    these cross - sections define the `` branching fractions '' of the non - resonant @xmath48 , which are displayed in figure [ br ] . in practice ,",
    "when a @xmath3 pair is found to be neither a resonance , nor heavy enough to be administrated by string fragmentation , one of the above final states is drawn at random according to the measured cross - sections at the current @xmath3 mass .",
    "the momenta of the outgoing hadrons are then generated uniformly in the available phase space using the cern routine genbod @xcite ( it has currently not been attempted to reproduce the inner kinematic structure of these multiparticle final states .",
    "for example , it is ignored that a significant part of the @xmath49 final state is genuinely @xmath50 decays ) .",
    "finally , the quark pair is replaced by its daughter hadrons in the pythia event record .",
    "the present algorithm has been implemented in the 2-fermion generator kk2f @xcite . running this generator in the configuration of current @xmath0 colliders",
    "allows to estimate the radiative hadronic cross - sections expected at these machines .",
    "table [ csec ] summarizes results for the existing @xmath51- and b - factories , and for a hypothetical charm factory such as the cleo - c program at cesr .",
    "given the expected luminosities at these machines , @xmath52 events are expected in regions where the knowledge of the hadronic cross - section is still limited .",
    "figure [ spectrum ] illustrates the differential hadronic cross - sections expected when operating at d- and b - meson threshold .",

    "table [ csec4f ] summarizes some results for the @xmath56 and @xmath57 processes . assuming 500 @xmath58 recorded per experiment , the number of expected events with one quark pair of mass smaller than 2 gev is @xmath59 , depending on the process under consideration .",
    "this confirms that such events can represent a substantial background to new particle searches , and need to be accounted for in the simulation of standard model processes .",

    "the routines implementing the methods described above are obtainable from @xcite , together with installation notes and commented example applications .",
    "a complete treatment of low - mass quark pair production and hadronization is described , which is relevant whenever the pair is produced via a virtual photon .",
    "this allows to release traditional cuts on quark pair invariant masses , and to study low mass hadronic systems specifically .",
    "the large statistics available at existing @xmath0 machines will allow to compare these predictions with experiment , with applications both in two- and four - fermion processes .",
