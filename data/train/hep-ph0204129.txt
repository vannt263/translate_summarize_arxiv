    "\\label{com2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantum field theory over noncommutative spaces @xcite has been reached a great interest in recent years with the re - motivation due to the string theory arguments @xcite .",
    "noncommutative field theories ( ncfts ) are difficult to handle since they have non - local structure and the lorentz symmetry is explicitly violated @xcite .",
    "the violation of the lorentz symmetry is due to the constants @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ com1 ] ) . since @xmath3 is antisymmetric , the vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constant three - vectors in preferred directions in a given lorentz frame .",
    "ncfts have been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "there has been a lot of work done on the renormalizability of ncft s @xcite .",
    "the unitarity in noncommutative theories and the unitarity properties of spontaneously broken noncommutative gauge theories have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "bounding noncommutative qcd due to the lorentz violation has been studied in @xcite and it was concluded that the collider limits were not competitive with low energy tests of lorentz violation for bounding the scale of space - time noncommutativity .",
    "furthermore , noncommutativity among extra dimensions for qed have been examined in @xcite .",
    "the noncommutative quantum electrodynamics ( ncqed ) have been studied in @xcite and the explicit calculation of electric dipole effects and anomalous magnetic moments have been done in @xcite . in the case of non - abelian case ,",
    "the field theory is formulated on noncommutative spaces as theories on commutative spaces , by expressing the noncommutativity using the @xmath4 product as in eq.([product ] ) @xcite .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite has been applied to the full standard model ( sm ) in @xcite and recently a unique model for strong and electroweak interactions with their unification has been constructed in @xcite . in a recent work @xcite , the sm forbidden @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays in the ncsm has been studied .    in our work , we study the possible structures appearing for the process @xmath10 in the ncsm up to the first order in @xmath11 , using the consistent formalism of ncsm @xcite . here",
    "the additional vertices of quarks with the scalar particles ( in our case the scalar particle is the unphysical higgs boson @xmath12 ) is proportional to the parameter @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is quark @xmath16 four momentum vector .",
    "however , for the vertices of quarks with the vector particles , here w boson or photon with four momentum @xmath15 , there exist new factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 in addition to @xmath19 .",
    "the similar behavior appears for @xmath20 and @xmath21 vertices .",
    "furthermore there are quark - quark-@xmath22 and quark - quark-@xmath23 four point interactions which do not exist in the commutative sm .",
    "therefore new structures appear , in addition to the ones which are based on the assumption that nc effects enters in to the expressions as an exponential factor @xmath24 , which is consistent in approximate phenomenology ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the inclusive @xmath10 process appears at least in the loop level ( see fig . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "now , we present the possible structures appearing for this process in the ncsm up to the first order in @xmath11 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath14 ( @xmath27 ) is the four momentum vector of @xmath28 quark ( photon @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 . here",
    "the first two structures exist in the commutative sm ( csm ) and the others are due to the noncommutative effects .",
    "notice that in the structures the @xmath31 quark mass is neglected . for the real photon case , namely the @xmath32 decay ,",
    "the structures @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 appear and the decay width for this process in the @xmath28-quark rest frame reads as @xmath40 where @xmath41- ( im[\\sum_i a_2 ( x_i)\\,\\sum_i a_5^ * ( x_i ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   2 im[\\sum_i a_2 ( x_i)\\,\\sum_i a_7^ * ( x_i ) ] +   re[\\sum_i a_2^ * ( x_i)\\,\\sum_i a_{11 } ( x_i)])\\ , p.\\widetilde{k } \\ , , \\label{decaywidth2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the coefficients corresponding to the existing structures .",

    "it is obvious that the main contribution to the decay width comes from the csm since the new part due to the ncsm is proportional to the extremely small parameter @xmath11 .",

    "\\label{decaywidth3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression shows that the space - space noncommutativity is carried by the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath53 . in the case of real coefficients",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath46 and @xmath55 play the main role for the time - space noncommutativity , since the imaginary parts of @xmath56 are coming from the ckm matrix elements , which are extremely small .    in conclusion ,",
    "the nc part of the decay width of the process under consideration is not easy to detect using present and even future sensibly arranged experiments .",
    "however , it brings a new source for the cp violating effects in addition to the complex ckm matrix elements in the sm , @xmath57 in our case . with the consistent calculations of the coefficents of this process and the precise experimental results of cp violating asymmetry",
