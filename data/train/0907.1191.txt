    "our goal is to reevaluate the viability of ( a particular class of ) unified dark matter / dark energy models from the point of view of cosmological observations .",
    "unification of dark matter and dark energy is an attractive idea because it would be simpler than to consider two separate dark components .",

    "the scalar field is assumed to mimic both dark matter and dark energy  @xcite .",
    "the basic requirements for a udm model to be viable are : ( i ) the background evolution is composed of the early - time matter - dominated phase and late - time accelerated phase ; ( ii ) the evolution of cosmological perturbations is consistent with observations . among various models we are interested in those which are described by  @xcite @xmath4^ { \\alpha/(1 + \\alpha ) }   \\label{action : gdbi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 . in the case of @xmath6",
    "this reduces to the dirac - born - infeld lagrangian that appears in string theory  @xcite , but it is phenomenologically interesting to consider general @xmath7 .",
    "the scalar field model  ( [ action : gdbi ] ) has an equivalent description in terms of a barotropic fluid with the equation of state @xmath8 the fluid version is referred to as the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model  @xcite .",
    "cosmological consequences of the gcg model have been extensively investigated so far  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of cosmological fluctuations basically depends on the sound speed @xmath9 of a fluid , and in the gcg case the sound speed crucially depends on the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the allowed parameter space is strongly constrained by the data on large scale structure ( lss )  @xcite to be @xmath11 , leaving the models which are essentially identical to the usual cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath12cdm ) , in particular in the simplest modeling of the universe filled only with the gcg  @xcite .",
    "the situation seems to be drastically cured at least in the linear regime by adding a baryon component  @xcite , as baryon fluctuations grow in a standard way to reproduce the observed matter power spectrum consistently . since the linear growth factor of the baryonic fluctuation is still suppressed to about @xmath13 compared to the @xmath12cdm model , measurements of the cosmological parameter @xmath14 are expected to yield a strong constraint on the gcg model  @xcite .",
    "however , the limits from @xmath14 are still unclear because @xmath14 is strongly affected by non - linear effects  @xcite .",
    "most of the literature so far has focused on the models with @xmath15 probably because the sound speed exceeds the light velocity for @xmath16  @xcite . however , as argued in  @xcite , the superluminal propagation of a @xmath0-essence - type scalar field does not necessarily lead to the causality violation .",

    "their point is that the necessary condition to preserve causality is that the signal velocity does not exceed the light velocity in vacuum  @xcite . modifying the lagrangian  ( [ action : gdbi ] ) in an unobservable regime , they showed that the signal velocity does not exceed the light velocity .",
    "this note also focuses on the parameter range @xmath18 .",
    "we investigate the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) signal in the case where the sound speed of the gcg can become superluminal , in addition to the power spectrum of the baryon fluctuation studied in  @xcite .",
    "it is known that a finite sound speed enhances the isw effect  @xcite , due to which the gcg with @xmath19 is excluded  @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the superluminal models also yields large enhancement of the isw effect , which clearly inconsistent with observations .",
    "in contrast to weak lensing , the linear calculation of the isw effect is reliable , and hence this is probably most convenient way of constraining the superluminal gcg model .",
    "we consider the universe filled with the gcg and baryonic components .",
    "the two components are assumed to interact only gravitationally . as was pointed out in  @xcite , it is important to include the baryons to reproduce the observed matter power spectrum . since the modification made to cure the causality problem does not affect the cosmic evolution until now , we use the equation of state  ( [ eos : gcg ] ) .",
