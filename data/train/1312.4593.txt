    "the relatively long wavelengths and large oscillator strengths of the mgii absorbers make these systems accessible to ground - based spectrographs at @xmath14 , a redshift range where large galaxy samples can be effectively collected using 4-m class telescopes .",
    "early studies of host candidates of mgii absorbers have confirmed the circumgalactic nature of these systems ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . at @xmath15 ,",
    "mgii absorbers are found at projected physical separations @xmath16 kpc of normal galaxies characterized by a wide range of colors and luminosities @xcite .",
    "these absorbers originate in cool , photo - ionized gas at temperature @xmath17 k and trace high column densities of neutral hydrogen n(hi)@xmath18 @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "because of the relatively large oscillator strength , most of the mgii absorbers are likely saturated , especially in sdss spectra . in such cases ,",
    "the absorption equivalent width reflects the underlying gas kinematics rather than the total gas column density . on average ,",
    "stronger absorbers are found at smaller projected distances from the host galaxy ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . at the same time , mgii absorbers have also been found to be tracers of galactic - scale outflows in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "while several studies have been able to characterize the properties of the cgm based on observations of mgii absorption ( see @xcite for a recent compilation ) , there is still a lack of a general prescription that relates these absorbers to the overall galaxy population .",
    "yet it is possible to gain insights into the connection between the absorbing gas and luminous matter by measuring their two - point correlation function .",
    "the spatial two - point correlation function of astrophysical objects is a powerful tool to characterize the dark matter halos in which baryons inhabit ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in recent years",
    ", many studies have employed the large - scale clustering signal of various astrophysical objects to constrain the mass of the underlying dark matter halos .",
    "this technique relies on the understanding that the large - scale bias of dark matter halos is monotonically increasing with mass leading to a direct relationship between the amplitude of the two - point correlation function and the associated mean halo mass .",
    "the two - point correlation function of a wide range of astrophysical objects has been studied .",
    "these objects include , but are not limited to , qso metal line absorption systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , damped - ly@xmath20 systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , low- and intermediate - redshift sdss galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , quasars ( e.g.  @xcite ) , lyman - break selected ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and red galaxies at high-@xmath21 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    the two - point correlation function of intervening mgii @xmath22 absorbers found in qso spectra was among the early analyses aimed at characterizing the masses of absorber hosts at intermediate redshifts @xmath23 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in gauthier et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter g09 ) , the authors calculated the large - scale two - point cross - correlation function between a sample of @xmath24 mgii absorbers of strength @xmath25  and a _ volume - limited _ sample of @xmath26k luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) at @xmath0 .",
    "these authors found a mild decline in the mean halo bias of mgii absorbers with increasing rest - frame absorption equivalent width , @xmath27 , similar to the findings of @xcite and @xcite based on a flux - limited sample .",
    "in addition , g09 found a strong clustering signal of mgii absorbers on scales @xmath28 , indicating the presence of cool gas inside the virial radii of the dark matter halos hosting the passive lrgs .",
    "this result was later confirmed by the spectroscopic follow - up surveys of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath9@xmath2 relation has profound implications for the physical origin of the mgii absorbing gas .",
    "for instance , if more massive halos contain , on average more mgii gas along a given sightine , one would expect a monotonically increasing bias with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite developed a halo occupation distribution model and showed that the observed mildly decreasing trend in the @xmath9@xmath2 relation is consistent with a transition in the halo gas properties , from primarily cool in low mass halos to predominantly hot but with a small fraction of cool gas surviving in high mass halos .",
    "here we expand upon the g09 analysis , utilizing the largest mgii absorber catalog available from sdss dr7 .",
    "we extend the two - point correlation function to weaker absorbers with @xmath29  while improving the precision of the bias measurements of the stronger systems .",
    "specifically , we use a combined mgii catalog from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as described in the following section , the combined absorber catalog is five times larger than what was used in g09 , increasing the statistical significance of the halo bias measurements and allowing a clustering analysis based on absorber subsamples from smaller @xmath27 intervals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the samples of lrgs and mgii absorbers along with the methodology adopted to compute the two - point correlation functions .",
    "the two - point correlation functions and the derived bias and halo masses of absorber hosts are presented in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the nature of these absorbers in section 4 .",
    "we adopt a @xmath30 cosmology with @xmath31 and @xmath32 throughout the paper .",
    "all projected distances are in co - moving units unless otherwise stated and all magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "stellar and halo masses are in units of solar masses .",
    "the clustering signal of mgii absorbers is computed with respect to a reference population of astrophysical objects acting as tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution . as discussed in g09",
    ", this tracer should be distributed over the same imaging footprint as the qso sighlines that were searched for mgii absorbers . in addition , this reference population must have a redshift distribution similar to that of the absorbers",
    ". marked differences in survey mask definition or redshift distributions would alter both the shape and the amplitude of the correlation signal in an undesirable fashion .",
    "since mgii absorbers can be detected at @xmath33 in sdss spectroscopic data , the sdss lrg sample offers the largest reference population yielding a sufficient number of galaxy  mgii pairs necessary for a precise calculation of the two - point correlation function .",
    "lrgs are massive , super-@xmath5 galaxies which are routinely observed from the ground with 4-m class telescopes out to @xmath34 . the clustering signal of lrgs has confirmed that these galaxies reside in bias environments characterized by halo masses @xmath35   ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are excellent tracers of the large - scale structures in the universe .",
    "we used the @xcite photometrically - selected lrg catalog ( hereafter megazdr7 ) which is based on the sdss dr7 imaging footprint .",
    "the catalog comprises 1.4  m entries distributed over 7746 deg@xmath36 encompassing the spring fields of sdss located at @xmath37 .",
    "megazdr7 covers the photometric redshift range @xmath38 .",
    "note that the segue stripes were excluded from this catalog .",
    "in addition , the three sdss fall stripes ( 76 , 82 , 86 ) were excluded from the survey window function of @xcite mainly to simplify their survey window function . given the relatively small contribution of these stripes",
    ", we did not modify the @xcite galaxy catalog to include these stripes .     and mgii absorbers ( _ bold line _ ) . ]",
    "the lrgs were first selected via a series of cuts in a multidimensional color diagram @xcite while the photometric redshifts were constructed by an artificial neural network code . in all respects ,",
    "the lrgs were selected in an identical fashion to the galaxy sample employed in g09 . as shown in figure 2 of g09 ,",
    "galaxies with @xmath39 mag have uncertain photo-@xmath21 s .",
    "we thus restricted ourselves to objects with @xmath40 .",
    "magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction according to the @xcite maps . ] typical errors in the photometric redshifts of bright lrgs with @xmath41 are @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , we applied further cuts by requiring that @xmath43 , the star - galaxy separation parameter , to be @xmath44 . according to @xcite , selecting objects with @xmath45 limits the contamination fraction of m dwarf stars to @xmath46% .",
    "these cuts yielded a flux - limited catalog of 1.1 m objects .",
    "as discussed in g09 , a flux - limited selection criterion creates an inhomogeneous sample of lrgs , excluding intrinsically fainter and thus less massive objects at higher redshifts .",
    "these authors showed that absorber bias may have been overestimated by as much as @xmath47% in previous studies based on flux - limited samples of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , we adopted a volume - limited sample of limiting magnitude @xmath48 over the redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "the limiting magnitude corresponds to the absolute magnitude of our faintest galaxies while the redshift range was selected to maximize both the number of lrgs and absorbers included in the calculation .",
    "increasing the upper - limit of the redshift range would select intrinsically brighter galaxies resulting in a much smaller sample size . after excluding all galaxies falling outside our survey mask ( see section 2.4.2 ) , our final lrg catalog comprises 333k entries , an increase of @xmath49% compared to g09 .",
    "the photometric redshift distribution of the lrgs is presented in the bottom panel of figure 1 .     measured by both zm13 and s13 for a subsample of @xmath50 1500 mgii absorbers listed in both catalogs .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the best - fit linear regression of the data @xmath51 (  ) . ]",
    "@xcite and seyffert et al . (",
    "2013 ) carried out independent searches of mgii absorption features in the spectra of distant qsos found in the sdss dr7 qso spectroscopic catalog , producing the two largest mgii absorber catalogs that are available in the literature .",
    "these separate efforts allow us to evaluate the completeness and confirm the accuracy of each absorber catalog . by comparing these catalogues ,",
    "our goal is to establish the most _ complete _ mgii catalog while eliminating as many false positives as possible .",
    "although both catalogs are derived from essentially the same qso spectra , we found that they significantly differ in the number of detected absorbers , completeness , and the rate of likely false detections .",
    "even when a given absorber is identified by both groups , we found systematic differences in the measurements of @xmath2 ( see figure 2 ) . in this section , we describe how we compared and combined these two catalogs to yield the final absorber sample adopted for the two - point correlation calculation .",
    "we first describe each catalog separately along with their respective detection techniques .",
    "we then discuss the methods we employed to combine the two catalogues and produce the final mgii absorber sample .",
    "the seyffert et al ( 2013 , hereafter s13 ) mgii absorber catalog was constructed using a subset of the sdss dr7 quasar catalog and following an equivalent methodology to the civ survey described in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly outline the procedure .    of the 105,783 quasar spectra in schneider et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , 79,595 were searched for mgii systems if they satisfy the following criteria : ( a ) the qsos were not broad - absorption - line qsos ( i.e. were not listed in @xcite ) ; ( b ) the median signal - to - noise ratio exceeds @xmath52 per pixel in the region where intervening absorbers could be detected , outside of the ly@xmath20 forest .    every quasar spectrum was normalized with a  hybrid continuum , \" a fit combining principle - component analysis , @xmath9-spline correction , and pixel / absorption - line rejection .",
    "absorption line candidates were automatically detected by convolving the normalized flux and error arrays with a gaussian kernel with fwhm = 1 pixel , roughly an sdss resolution element ( resel ) .",
    "the candidate lines with convolved @xmath53 per resolution element in the @xmath542796 line and @xmath55 in @xmath542803 were paired into candidate mgii doublets if the separations of the two lines fell within @xmath56 km / s of the expected doublet separation @xmath57 km / s .",
    "any automatically detected absorption feature with @xmath58 per resolution element and broad enough to enclose a mgii doublet was included in the candidate list .",
    "s13 excluded absorbers blueshifted by less than 3000 km / s from the qso redshift . for the purposes of this constraint , the quasar redshifts were taken from schneider et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , not from @xcite , as was used in @xcite and the rest of the current work .",
    "all candidates were visually inspected by at least one author of s13 and most by two .",
    "they were rated on a four - point scale from 0 ( definitely false ) to 3 ( definitely true ) .",
    "the systems were judged largely on the basis of the expected properties of the mgii doublet ( e.g. , centroid alignment , correlated profiles ) but also including possible , associated ions for verification .",
    "any system with rating of 2 or 3 were included in subsequent analyses .",
    "the wavelength bounds of the absorption lines were automatically defined by where the convolved @xmath59 array began increasing when stepping away from the automatically detected line centroid .",
    "the new centroid was then set to be the flux - weighted mean wavelength within the bounds , and the mgii doublet redshift was defined by the new centroid of the @xmath542796 transition .",
    "the sum of the absorbed flux within the bounds sets the equivalent width . in summary ,",
    "the s13 catalog contains 35,629 absorbers over the redshift range @xmath60 .",
    "we also examined the recently published zhu & mnard ( 2013 , hereafter zm13 ) mgii catalog .",
    "the zm13 catalog is based on a sample of 85,533 qso sightlines distributed over the sdss dr7 legacy and segue spectroscopic footprints .",
    "in addition , zm13 included 1411 qsos from the @xcite sample that were not identified in schneider et al .",
    "their catalog consists of 35,752 intervening mgii absorbers over the redshift range @xmath60 .    in brief",
    ", zm13 used a non - negative principle component analysis ( pca ) and a set of eigenspectra to estimate the continuum level of each qso spectrum .",
    "further improvements on the continuum estimation was done by applying two median filters of 141 and 71 pixels in width .",
    "this process was repeated three times until convergence was achieved .",
    "once the continuum is determined , candidate mgii absorbers were selected via a matching filter search involving the mgii doublet and four feii lines .",
    "absorbers were identified if their @xmath59 was above a minimum threshold of 4 for the @xmath61 line and 2 for the @xmath62 line .",
    "each candidate doublet was then fitted with double - gaussian profiles and candidates were rejected if the measured doublet separation exceeded 1 . to further eliminate false positives ,",
    "zm13 made use of the feii @xmath63 and @xmath64 lines to measure the @xmath59 of the four lines and applied a cut on the @xmath59 to reject false positives .",
    "finally , @xmath2 and @xmath65 were determined by fitting a gaussian ( or double gaussian ) to the candidate profile . in summary ,",
    "the zm13 method is fully automated and involves little human intervention .",
    "of mgii absorbers as measured by s13 with respect to the median @xmath59 per pixel , @xmath66 , of the qso spectra over the redshift range @xmath67 .",
    "the solid line is a 3rd - order polynomial fit to the bottom 5th percentile of the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "we interpret this fit as the typical lower - limit on @xmath2 that can be measured along a qso sightline of given @xmath66 .",
    "the determination of this lower limit on @xmath68 is necessary to generate the catalog of random absorbers ( see section 2.3.4 ) . ]",
    "we first compared the two catalogs and identified common absorbers by selecting those with the same ra and dec coordinates .",
    "in addition , we made sure that for each matched absorber , the observed wavelength listed in one catalog s was falling within the wavelength bounds of the other and vice versa . in the redshift range @xmath67 , at velocity separation @xmath69 @xmath70   below the qso redshift and within our survey mask ( see section 2.3.2 ) we found 1491 matched absorbers in the zm13 and s13 catalogs .",
    "the redshifts of these absorbers , as measured by s13 is consistent with the published values of zm13 .",

    "we found @xmath72 where @xmath73 is measured by s13 and @xmath74 by zm13 .    to determine which measurement of @xmath2 should be adopted in our final absorber catalog",
    ", we examined @xmath75 100 randomly selected absorbers in zm13 and s13 .",
    "we first fitted the qso spectra with a series of third - order @xmath76splines to set the continuum level in the spectral regions of the absorbers and we visually established the boundaries of the absorbing region .",
    "we determined @xmath2 by integrating the flux decrement between the absorption boundaries .",
    "our measurements are in agreement with s13 .",
    "we found that zm13 tends to underestimate the continuum level , although the differences are typically @xmath77 .",
    "we thus adopted the @xmath2 estimates of s13 and we applied the above @xmath2 correction for absorbers found only by zm13 .    to establish our final absorber catalogs , we applied further selection criteria .",
    "in addition to the absorber redshift range , qso  absorber velocity separation , and survey footprint cuts discussed above , we also applied cuts to eliminate false detections .",
    "we first applied a series of @xmath78 ratios to eliminate systems with either very large ( @xmath79 ) or very low ( @xmath80 ) column density ratios that are inconsistent with mgii absorbers being either optically thin or completely saturated .",
    "in addition , we applied a combined 2.9@xmath81 detection threshold on the doublet components decomposed into a 2.5@xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) threshold on the @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) transition .",
    "furthermore , one of us ( klc ) visually inspected all the remaining systems and further eliminated likely false positives .",
    "finally , we eliminated four absorbers found by zm13 that occur in the hewett & wild ( 2010 ) sample of 1411 visually - inspected qso sightlines because there is no @xmath59 estimate readily available for these qso sightlines ( see section 2.3.4 ) .",
    "these selection criteria yielded a sample 2323 absorbers .",
    "we further restricted the sample to absorbers with @xmath83  to ensure a large enough sample ( @xmath84 ) of qso sightlines with sufficient @xmath59 to detect the _ weakest _ absorbers .",
    "this selection criterion is particularly important when generating the random absorber catalog for the weakest systems ( see section 2.3.4 ) .",
    "this final cut reduces the number of absorbers to 2211 .    of these 2211 absorbers ,",
    "1260 were found by zm13 and s13 , 793 were only found by s13 , and 158 only by zm13 .",
    "a number of reasons explain why 793 absorbers were found by s13 and not by zm13 . among them",
    ", 265 absorbers were found within @xmath85 redward of the qso civ emission with the qso emission redshift defined by hewett & wild ( 2010 ) .",
    "in addition , 40 absorbers were found within @xmath86 blueward of the qso mgii emission , and 8 were found in near galactic caii h&k absorbers .",
    "a combination of factors , including differences in the automatic line detection algorithm and user biases could potentially explain why the remaining 480 systems were missed by zm13 although estimating the relative importance of each factor is beyond the scope of this paper ( see s13 for further details ) .",
    "as for the 158 absorbers detected by zm13 and not by s13 , 6 occur in sightlines with @xmath87 pix@xmath88 in the region searched for mgii absorbers , 53 are found in sightlines identified as bals by @xcite , and 99 have too low @xmath89 in either the @xmath90 or @xmath62 spectral regions to be automatically detected by s13 .    in summary ,",
    "our final catalog consists of @xmath91 absorbers with @xmath92  and distributed over the redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "note that the typical redshift error of these absorbers is very small and of order @xmath93km / s . in figure [ distributions ] ,",
    "we show the redshift distributions of lrgs and mgii absorbers as well as the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "the distribution of @xmath65 is flat while the photo-@xmath21 distribution increases sightly toward higher @xmath21 .",
    "we divided this mgii sample according to @xmath2 into four bins of approximately equal number of absorbers .",
    "each bin contains roughly the same number of absorbers as the entire mgii sample considered by g09 .",
    "the bins considered have @xmath94,[0.78 - 1.08],[1.08 - 1.59]$ ] , and @xmath95 $ ]  .",
    "a detailed description of the method to measure the two - point correlation function is presented in g09 . in summary",
    ", we adopted the landy & szalay ( 1993 , hereafter ls93 ) minimum variance estimator to calculate the projected two - point auto- and cross - correlation functions ( @xmath96 ) between mgii absorbers and lrgs .",
    "the ls93 estimator is @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are data and random points ; @xmath100 and @xmath101 refer to absorbers and galaxies ; and @xmath102 is the projected co - moving separation on the sky between two objects .",
    "we adopted the same binning as in g09 and divided the pairs into eight @xmath102 bins equally spaced in logarithmic space and covering the range @xmath103 .",
    "the upper limit of 35 is a few times smaller than the size of our jackknife cells ( see section 2.4.3 ) . in the following subsections , we discuss the selection of a survey mask and the methodology adopted to generate random galaxies @xmath104 and absorbers @xmath105 .",
    "when computing the @xmath106 statistics , both data and randoms should be distributed on the same survey mask .",
    "if galaxies and absorbers occupy survey windows that are not completely overlapping on the sky , the shape and amplitude of the correlation signal would be altered in an undesirable fashion .",
    "hence it is crucial to identify a survey mask that is common to both lrgs and mgii absorbers and large enough to minimize the number of objects falling outside the survey mask .",
    "in addition , the same survey mask shall be used to distribute random lrgs and mgii absorbers .",
    "we adopted the sdss dr7 spectroscopic angular selection function mask available at http://space.mit.edu/  molly / mangle / download / data.html . ]",
    "provided by the nyu value - added galaxy catalog team @xcite and assembled with the mangle 2.1 software @xcite .",
    "this mask represents the completeness of the sdss spectroscopic survey as a function of the angular position on the sky .",
    "since lrgs were not identified by @xcite in stripes 76,82 and 86 , we also excluded these stripes from the survey window .",
    "in addition , our adopted survey mask does not include the segue spectroscopic mask .",
    "we consider two independent sources contributing to the errors in the measured @xmath96 : cosmic variance and photometric redshift uncertainties .",
    "the contribution of cosmic variance can be estimated by using the jackknife resampling technique applied to the survey mask .",
    "the sky was separated into @xmath107 cells of similar survey area ( @xmath108 deg@xmath36 ) .",
    "the choice of the number of cells was obtained after running convergence tests on a varying number of cells ( see g09 for more details ) .",
    "the cosmic variance estimate for each @xmath109 corresponds to the @xmath110th - diagonal element of the covariance matrix calculated with the jackknife method , @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents the iteration in which box @xmath112 was removed from the calculation .",
    "the mean value @xmath113 was calculated for bin @xmath110 over all @xmath114 s .",
    "although @xmath102 bins are correlated on large scales we consider only the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix when estimating the contribution of cosmic variance to the error on @xmath96 .",
    "the second source of errors comes from large uncertainties in the photometric redshifts of the galaxies . as discussed in g09 ,",
    "photometric redshift uncertainties affect @xmath96 in two distinct ways .",
    "the first effect is to _ lower _ the overall clustering amplitude by introducing uncorrelated pairs in the calculation ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the second effect is to add random noise in the calculation .",
    "this is particularly important for the inner @xmath102 bins which particularly suffer from an uncertainty on @xmath115 which translates into a large fractional uncertainty on @xmath102 .    to estimate the random noise in @xmath96 as a result of photo-@xmath21 uncertainties",
    ", we followed the procedure described in g09 . in brief , for each cross- and auto - correlation calculation , we generated 100 independent realizations of the lrg catalog by sampling the photo-@xmath21 distribution of each galaxy .",
    "we considered that each photo-@xmath21 distribution can be characterized by a normal distribution with @xmath116 and a mean value @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "we then calculated @xmath96 for each realization and determined the photo-@xmath21 contribution to the error on @xmath96 by calculating the dispersion among these 100 realizations for each @xmath102 bin .",
    "we found that while photometric redshift uncertainties can increase the random error by @xmath117% at @xmath118 , the effect is negligible for larger values of @xmath102 . typically at these larger @xmath102 values ,",
    "the increase is @xmath119% for the lrg auto - correlation signal .",
    "not surprisingly , the effect is smaller for the cross - correlation calculation since only one of the two pair members has photometric redshift .",
    "these findings are consistent with g09 .",
    "since the contribution of photo-@xmath21 s uncertainties is negligible on large scale where the clustering amplitude is calculated , we thus only considered cosmic variance in the error budget of @xmath96 .",
    "note however that photo-@xmath21 s also lowers the amplitude of the clustering signal and this effect is significant and is discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "the ra and dec positions of each random lrg was generated using the _ ransack _ routine available through the mangle software package .",
    "the redshifts of the random galaxies were determined by sampling the redshift distribution of the lrgs ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the number of random galaxies was determined after running convergence tests .",
    "as discussed in g09 , having @xmath50 10 times more random galaxies than the actual number of lrgs is sufficient to achieve convergence .",

    "we limited the fit to data points in the two - halo regime where the bias is determined .",
    "as discussed in zehavi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , correlation functions of galaxies display departures from power law models , especially at large separations . in the lrg auto - correlation function , this departure is more pronounced at @xmath132  and demonstrates the limitation of using such power law fits to determine the bias of galaxies and absorber hosts . in _ grey circles _ , we show the lrg ",
    "mgii cross - correlation signal .",

    "the thin black line and the shaded areas correspond to the best - fit and 1-@xmath81 errors on the amplitude @xmath100 .",
    "note that the best - fit power - law models are only shown to guide the eye and do not enter in the calculation of the relative bias of absorber hosts .",
    "the other five panels display the cross - correlation signals for the five @xmath2 bins considered .",
    "the range of @xmath2 for each bin is labeled in the upper - right corner of each panel . in all panels ,",

    "note that the data points shown in figure [ xx ] have _ not _ been corrected for the systematic effects of photometric redshifts on the clustering amplitude .",
    "these considerations will enter in the calculation of the relative bias of absorber hosts and are discussed in section 3.2 .        at @xmath134 2 , where lrg  lrg and mgii  lrg pairs are probing distinct dark matter halos ( i.e. ,  in the two - halo regime ) , the weakest absorbers ( @xmath135 ) have the largest cross - correlation amplitude similar to the lrg auto - correlation signal .",
    "in contrast , absorbers in the bin @xmath136  show , on average , the lowest clustering amplitude on large scales .      here",
    "we provide a brief discussion of the theoretical framework behind the determination of the mgii absorber host bias and halo mass from the projected two - point correlation function .",
    "a more detailed overview can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the bias of dark matter halos of mass @xmath137 is the ratio of the real - space two - point correlation function of these dark matter halos , @xmath138 , and the dark matter auto - correlation function @xmath139 @xmath140 in practice , we compute the projected two - point correlation statistics by integrating the real - space correlation function along the line - of - sight ( @xmath141 ) direction @xmath142 the lrg  lrg auto - correlation signal @xmath143 can be decomposed into a mass dependent @xmath144 and scale dependent @xmath145 term @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the bias - weighted mean halo mass . similarly , the cross - correlation absorber ",
    "galaxy term can be written as @xmath148 where the terms with subscript @xmath100 refer to the absorbers . on large scales and for the halo masses considered in this paper , the scale dependence of @xmath149 , @xmath150 , is almost independent of halo mass and is divided out when computing the relative bias of absorber hosts , @xmath151 .",
    "consequently , one can write @xmath152 where @xmath151 is the scale - independent relative bias of absorber hosts @xmath100 with respect to a population of galaxies @xmath101 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath151 can be calculated from the ratio of the projected two - point correlation functions @xmath153 on large scales . from @xmath151 , the bias ( and mass ) of the absorber hosts",
    "can be derived if the absolute bias of the tracer galaxy population ( @xmath154 ) is known . for this purpose",
    ", we adopted the same galaxy bias as in g09 .",
    "since the lrg selection criteria and redshift range are the same as g09 , the auto - correlation signal of lrgs should , in principle be the same .",
    "we verified that this was the case . in the upper - left panel of figure [ xx ]",
    ", we show the lrg auto - correlation signal of g09 in _ crosses_. as expected , the differences from g09 are negligible .",
    "we thus adopted the bias value of @xmath155 as found by g09 .      before calculating the relative bias of mgii absorber hosts , it is important to consider the effects of photometric redshifts on the clustering amplitude and bias measurements .",
    "lrgs typically have photo-@xmath21 accuracy of @xmath156 .",
    "large uncertainties on the galaxy redshifts affect the clustering signal in two different ways .",
    "since the redshifts are uncertain , the angular diameter distance is uncertain too , introducing uncertainties in the projected co - moving separations between lrgs and mgii absorbers and effectively  smoothing \" out sharp features present in the intrinsic two - point correlation signal . as discussed in section 2.4.3",
    ", this source of uncertainty mostly affects the inner bins of the correlation function and is negligible at @xmath157 2 where the clustering amplitude is measured .",
    "furthermore , photometric redshift errors effectively _ broadens _ the redshift range included in the calculation and adds uncorrelated galaxy  mgii pairs in the calculation .",
    "this effect results in a systematic lowering of the _ amplitude _ of the clustering signal .",
    "g09 addressed this issue by calculating the projected clustering signal on mock lrg distributions .",
    "their mock catalog was produced by populating dark matter halos of an @xmath158body simulation with a halo occupation distribution function determined from a spectroscopic lrg sample .",
    "then the redshift of each galaxy was perturbed to mimic the effects of photometric redshifts and the authors re - calculated the two - point correlation statistics . in a nutshell",
    ", g09 found that the mgii ",
    "lrg cross - correlation amplitude on large scales ( @xmath159 ) is reduced by a factor 0.79@xmath1600.02 compared to what is found for a spectroscopic sample of lrgs while the lrg  lrg auto - correlation amplitude is reduced by 0.71@xmath1600.01 .",
    "consequently , we determined the relative bias , @xmath151 , by multiplying the uncorrected @xmath151 values by the correction factor @xmath161 .",
    "hereafter , all @xmath151 and absolute bias measurements @xmath9 are corrected for this systematic effect introduced by photometric redshifts .    in g09 , they discussed the direct ratio ( dr ) method to calculate the relative bias of absorber hosts .",
    "this technique employs the weighted mean ratio of all data points at @xmath162  to obtain @xmath151 @xmath163 where the weights , @xmath164 are given by @xmath165 the index @xmath110 denotes the @xmath102 bin and @xmath166 is the error on @xmath167 using error propagation technique as is the error on @xmath151 ( see g09 ) . in table 2",
    ", we provide estimates for the relative bias @xmath151 , bias @xmath9 , and halo masses for each one of the five @xmath2 bins considered and the entire mgii sample .      as discussed in section 3.1 , the halo mass of absorber hosts",
    "could be obtained simply by inverting the @xmath168 relationship .",
    "we refer to this method as _ bias - inverted _ halo mass .",
    "moreover , one can estimate halo masses by integrating the bias - weighted halo mass function down in mass until the bias value reaches @xmath9 .",
    "the minimum halo mass corresponding to @xmath9 can thus be used as a lower - limit in the integral of the halo mass function .",
    "this _ bias - weighted _ halo mass estimate is simply derived by integrating the mass - weighted halo mass function using this lower - limit .",
    "these two techniques were discussed in details in g09 .",
    "the authors show that the methods give halo mass estimates within 0.1 dex of each other for both lrgs and mgii absorber hosts .",
    "consequently , we followed the g09 methodology and used the bias - inverted masses as our mgii hosts mass estimates .",
    "in figure [ rel_bias ] , we show the relative bias , bias , and halo masses of mgii absorber hosts for the five @xmath2 bins considered . except for the weakest absorbers , the lower error bars we quoted on the halo masses are arbitrary .",
    "this lack of constraints arises because when the lower error bar on the bias reaches 0.7 , there is no constraint on the halo mass .",

    ".description of the cross - correlation calculations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the observed @xmath9@xmath2 relation offers a statistical characterization of the origin of the mgii absorbers as a whole , but the interpretation requires a comprehensive model of halo gas content as a function of halo mass .",
    "similarly , the frequency distribution function @xmath171 of absorbers , namely the number of absorbers per unit @xmath78 per unit comoving length , also provides important constraints on halo gas models .",

    "in contrast with the simple model presented above , tc08 also developed a halo occupation distribution model ( hod ) in which they introduced a transition mass scale of @xmath223  above which a shock develops and reduce the amount of mgii absorbing gas within the shock radius .",
    "this transition mass scale was motivated by recent hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation showing two distinct channels of gas accretion for halos above and below the transition scale ( e.g. @xcite ) , although the conclusions drawn from these early studies are now being challenged by recent hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
