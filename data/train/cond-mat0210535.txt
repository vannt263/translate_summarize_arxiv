    "we will focus on a cdma system using binary shift keying ( bpsk ) symbols and @xmath0 random binary spreading codes of the spreading factor @xmath1 with unit energy over an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume the power is completely controlled to unit energy ; but the extension to the case of distributed powers is straightforward . under these assumptions ,",
    "a received base - band cdma signal is expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are indices for samples and users , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is the spreading code with unit energy independently generated from the identical unbiased distribution @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the bit signal of user @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is a gaussian white noise sample with zero mean and unit variance and @xmath10 is the standard deviation of awgn . using these normalisations , the signal to noise ratio",
    "is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 . in the following ,",
    "we assume a situation where both of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are large keeping @xmath13 finite .",
    "the goal of multiuser detection is to simultaneously infer the bit signals @xmath14 after receiving the base - band signals @xmath15 .",
    "the bayesian approach offers a useful framework for such purposes .",
    "assuming that the bit signals are independently generated from the unbiased distribution , the posterior distribution given the base - band signals is provided as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , \\label{eq : conditional}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath18 . following the bayesian framework",
    ", one can systematically derive the optimal inference strategy from the posterior distribution ( [ eq : posterior ] ) for various cost functions .",
    "for instance , it can be shown that the bit error rate ( ber ) , which is the cost function that we will focus on in this paper , is minimised by the maximiser of the posterior marginal ( mpm ) estimator @xmath19",
    "unfortunately , the necessary cost for exactly computing the mpm estimator explodes exponentially with respect to the number of users @xmath0 in the current system , which implies that one has to resort to an approximation in practice . the belief propagation ( bp ) , or the sum - product algorithm ,",
    "is known as one of the most promising approaches to such tasks although its performance for densely connected systems , including complete bipartite graphs , has not been sufficiently examined yet @xcite .",
    "we here investigate the efficacy of bp in densely connected systems employing it to the present cdma multiuser detection problem .    in order to introduce this algorithm to the current system ,",
    "let us denote the base - band and bit signals by two kinds of nodes and connect them with an edge when they are related . since the conditional probability of @xmath20 ( [ eq : conditional ] ) depends on all of @xmath21 , this implies that the posterior distribution ( [ eq : posterior ] ) can be expressed as a complete bipartite graph as shown in figure [ fig : bipartite ] .",
    "= 70 mm    then , bp can be defined as an algorithm passing messages between the two kinds of nodes through edges as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an index for counting the number of updates , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants for normalisation constraints @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the marginalised posterior at @xmath28th update is evaluated from @xmath29 as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a normalisation constant .    as @xmath7 is a binary variable",
    ", one can parameterise the above functions as @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 without loss of generality , which simplifies the expressions ( [ eq : horizontal ] ) and ( [ eq : vertical ] ) as @xmath35 employing these variables , the approximated posterior average of @xmath7 at @xmath28th update can be computed as @xmath36 .",

    "( [ eq : hat ] ) brings about a computational explosion when @xmath0 is large , which implies exactly performing bp becomes hopeless in the current system .",
    "however , appropriately employing the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers , which is a standard procedure in statistical - mechanical analysis @xcite , makes it possible to approximately carry out the belief updates ( [ eq : hat ] ) and ( [ eq : nohat ] ) in a practical time scale .    since @xmath37 is small for large @xmath1 , we expand the conditional probability as @xmath38   \\cr   & \\simeq&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_0",

    "as the spreading codes are generated independently , @xmath40 and @xmath41 would be uncorrelated when @xmath41 is generated from @xmath42 .",
    "this , in conjunction with the central limit theorem , implies that @xmath39 obeys a normal distribution @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , due to the law of large numbers , @xmath46 is highly likely to be well approximated by @xmath47 . substituting these",

    "two points are worthy of noticing .",
    "firstly , the most time - consuming operation in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rt_update ] ) , ( [ eq : horizontal2 ] ) and ( [ eq : uupdate ] ) is @xmath82 , which totally requires @xmath59 computations .",
    "this implies that the computational cost for performing the current scheme is similar to that of the conventional multistage detection @xcite @xmath83 secondly , as the fixed point condition , coupled nonlinear equations @xmath84 ,   \\label{eq : tap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are obtained from our update scheme , where @xmath85 .",
    "this is identical to the thouless - anderson - palmer ( tap ) equation for the current system known in statistical mechanics @xcite and _ inverse temperature _ @xmath86 are usually employed for characterising a system instead of @xmath13 and @xmath87 . ] .",
    "however , it should be emphasised here that , the naive iteration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tap ] ) does not serve as a useful detection algorithm as finding the fixed point by it from a reasonable initial state is difficult .",
    "this will be illustrated by numerical experiments in the final section .",
    "the density evolution is a framework to analyse the dynamical property of bp pursuing a macroscopic distribution of messages @xcite . in the current system",
    ", this analysis is considerably simplified as the aligned field @xmath88 is likely to obey a normal distribution as a result of the central limit theorem .",
    "let us assume that @xmath89 is independently sampled from a normal distribution the average and variance of which are @xmath90 and variance @xmath91 , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : ef_qm ] ) and ( [ eq : mq_ef ] ) express the density evolution with respect to the current algorithm .",
    "it should be noticed that the obtained expression of the density evolution directly links the proposed algorithm to the equilibrium analysis presented in @xcite since eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ef_qm ] ) and ( [ eq : mq_ef ] ) can be regarded as the naive iteration dynamics of the saddle point equations provided by the replica method @xcite .",
    "this implies that our algorithm can practically calculate the mpm estimator ( [ eq : map ] ) in @xmath59 computations obtaining the fixed point solution when @xmath0 is large since the replica analysis is likely to evaluate the exact performance for @xmath111 , which , however , has not been rigorously proved yet .",
    "in order to validate the obtained results , we performed numerical experiments in a system @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "= 100 mm    firstly , it is clear that pa converges to the fixed point considerably faster than msd , which is a highly preferred property in practical use .",
    "secondly , pa and de exhibit excellent consistency as we speculated in the previous section , which implies that employment of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers for deriving eqs .",

    "finally , tap does not serve as a useful detection algorithm .",
    "this is because the iteration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tap ] ) does not correctly approximate bp and , therefore , can not sufficiently cancel self - reactions from the past states in the transient dynamics although it does provide the correct fixed point condition in the stationary state .    in summary",
    ", we have developed a novel algorithm for the cdma multiuser detection from the belief propagation appropriately employing the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers .",
    "the new algorithm exhibits considerably faster convergence than the conventional multistage detection without increasing the computational cost significantly and is likely to practically provide the optimal mpm estimator when the spreading factor @xmath1 is large .",
