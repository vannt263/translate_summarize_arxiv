    "a fundamental goal of material science is to design materials with exactly prescribed properties , which are optimal for a specific purpose . in principle , this issue could be addressed experimentally with the help of trial and error strategies",
    ". however , such strategies are often very expensive and time - consuming .",
    "therefore , the development of computational simulations for optimizing materials has become an emerging field of research in the recent years .",
    "the success of computational material design is boosted by the fact that computation speed and efficiency of hardware and high performance systems have strongly increased over the last decades .",
    "nevertheless , physical experiments still have to remain an integral part of the process of designing optimized materials , but the number of such experiments can be significantly reduced if the used computational methods are proven to be reliable . therefore , a good mathematical understanding of the computational methods is very important .",
    "the field of numerical mathematics provides well - understood numerical schemes like the finite element method for the numerical solution of the partial differential equations modeling the behavior of the materials .",
    "however , many materials relevant for technical applications , such as composite materials , have a microstructure and hence their material parameters vary on small length scales . to resolve the microstructure with the help of the classical finite element method , the mesh grid size has to be chosen very small such that the computational effort is very high .",
    "but since effects of microstructures often average out on macroscopic length scales , it is sufficient in many situations to compute the effective material behavior on macroscopic scales",
    ".    an important mathematical strategy to determine the effective material behavior is the application of so - called homogenization processes . the general idea of homogenization is to replace a multiscale problem by a homogeneous problem with the same effective properties . in analytical homogenization theory ,",
    "the homogeneous problem is obtained as the limit of a sequence of multiscale problems with faster and faster oscillating parameters , and formulas for the homogeneous parameters of the limit problem are provided , see , for example , @xcite . however , in general , it is difficult to compute the values of the homogeneous parameters explicitly .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to develop numerical homogenization processes .",
    "such a numerical homogenization process is given by the so - called embedded cell method , an algorithm which was developed by dong and schmauder @xcite in 1996 to compute the stress - strain curves for metal - ceramic composite materials or more generally for particle or fiber reinforced materials .",
    "these materials are of great importance for the automotive industry , e.g. for rotor brakes , the aerospace technology , e.g. for lightweight elements , or the medical technology , e.g. for implants .",
    "the basic idea of the embedded cell method is to replace the metal - ceramic composite material with its complex geometry by a so - called embedded cell consisting of a connected component of ceramic particles surrounded by a metal matrix ( or vice versa ) which is embedded into a dummy material whose material parameters are determined by a self - consistent numerical iteration scheme .",
    "the volume ratio between the ceramic and the metallic part of the embedded cell is the same as in the original composite material .",
    "the volume of the dummy material is larger than the volumes of the ceramic and the metallic part such that the influence of the geometry of the exterior boundary of the dummy material on the embedded cell can be neglected .",
    "having determined the material parameters of the dummy material the strain - stress curve of the composite material consisting of the embedded cell and the dummy material is computed numerically .",
    "numerical experiments show that the strain - stress curves obtained via the embedded cell method are often very close to the strain - stress curves of the corresponding original composite materials measured in physical experiments . a first attempt to prove analytic convergence results",
    "can be found in @xcite . however , the question how the results of the iteration process are related to the exact solutions of the underlying mathematical equations and to the formulas for the effective material parameters provided by analytical homogenization theory remained open .    in general , the effective material behavior of a composite material does not only depend on the volume ratio of its phases but also on the spatial arrangement of the phases .",
    "for example , a stiff material with inclusions of a soft material behaves differently than a soft material with inclusions of a stiff material even if the volume ratios between the stiff and the soft phase are the same for both composite materials .",
    "the formulas for the effective material behavior from analytical homogenization theory take into account both the volume fraction and the spatial arrangement of the phases .",
    "in contrast , the embedded cell method in its present form respects the volume fraction of the phases but only allows that one connected component of one phase is surrounded by another phase and the dummy material .",
    "hence , it can not be expected that the strain - stress curves computed by the embedded cell method always coincide with the strain - stress curves obtained with the help of analytical homogenization theory .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate for which kind of composite materials and which spatial arrangements of their phases both homogenization methods yield comparable results .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to prove some basic results on the convergence behavior of the embedded cell method and its relation to analytical homogenization theory . for composite materials",
    "whose material parameters vary only in one direction the effective material behavior is completely determined by the volume ratio of its phases . consequently , we can prove for a one dimensional model of linear elastic materials and a simple one dimensional plasticity model by explicit calculations that the embedded cell method converges and that the material properties predicted by the limit coincide with the effective material properties provided by analytical homogenization theory .    as a first step towards a general two dimensional theory",
    "we analyze a two dimensional model of linear hyperelastic isotropic composite materials with constant shear modulus and a first lam parameter which varies only by a small parameter @xmath0 . in this case , we prove that the embedded cell method converges and that the material properties of the limit coincide with the effective material properties from analytical homogenization theory at least up to an error of order @xmath1 for @xmath0 tending to zero since the influence of the volume ratio of the phases on the effective material behavior dominates the effects induced by the spatial arrangement of the phases .",
    "the assumption of a constant shear modulus has the advantage that we only need to model a tensile test for determining the effective first lam parameter and no shear test for determining the effective shear modulus such that we analyze the same experimental set - up as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our result and our proof can be generalized in a straightforward manner to the case when also the shear modulus varies by @xmath0 .",
    "the proof of our result relies on perturbation theory , complete induction using the iteration procedure of the embedded cell method and an a priori estimate from elliptic theory being valid also for weak solutions of our model equations , which is the appropriate notion of solution in the case of composite materials .",
    "moreover , we use a generalized formula for the tensile force which is also applicable to non - smooth data and weak solutions of the model equations .    since the embedded cell method has similarities with the hashin - shtrikman coated sphere construction , cf .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , we expect that for general two and three dimensional two - phase composite materials the effective first lam parameter and the effective shear modulus computed by the embedded cell method and the effective first lam parameter and the effective shear modulus obtained with the help of analytical homogenization theory share the property that they can be bounded from above and below by the hashin - shtrikman bounds which are the tightest bounds possible for composite moduli of two - phase composite materials , cf .",
    "it is subject of further research to prove that the embedded cell method has this useful property .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ chap : derivation ] , we present the physical model which will be the basis of our analysis as well as an existence and uniqueness result for solutions of the model equations . the boundary conditions in this model",
    "are chosen such that the model describes a tensile test . at the end of section [",
    "chap : derivation ] , we derive the generalized formula for the tensile force . in section [ chap :",
    "ecm ] , we present the embedding cell method . then we prove our convergence and correctness results for the one dimensional case in section [ chap : correctness_1d ] and for the two dimensional case in section [ chap : perturbation_theory ] .",

    "the model consists of the basic equations for linear hyperelastic isotropic solids applied to the experimental set - up of a tensile test .",
    "first , we recall the basic definitions of the theory of linear elasticity and the derivation of the basic equations for linear hyperelastic isotropic solids .",
    "our presentation mainly follows @xcite .",
    "consider a solid occupying the so - called reference configuration @xmath2 .",
    "the solid is exposed to an external body force @xmath3 and an external surface force @xmath4 .",
    "these external forces impose a deformation @xmath5 and a displacement @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the identical map , respectively .",
    "the deformed domain @xmath8 is called the current configuration . for @xmath9",
    "let @xmath10 be the displacement gradient and @xmath11 the symmetric part of the displacement gradient . for physical reasons it is reasonable to postulate that this deformation is injective and orientation - preserving , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "we consider static problems for which the stress principle of euler and cauchy ( cf .",
    "* axiom 2.2 - 1 ) ) holds .",
    "the stress principle of euler and cauchy postulates the existence of the so - called cauchy stress vector field @xmath13 with @xmath14 such that the following holds :    1 .   for an arbitrary subdomain @xmath15 and at any point @xmath16 where the unit outer normal vector @xmath17 to the surface @xmath18 exists it holds @xmath19 2 .",
    "the axiom of force balance holds , i.e. for any subdomain @xmath15 we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the surface measure on @xmath18 .",
    "the axiom of moment balance holds , i.e. for any subdomain @xmath22 we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cross product .",
    "the stress principle of euler and cauchy implies cauchy s theorem ( cf .",

    ", we mainly consider elastic materials .",
    "a material is called elastic if it returns back to its undeformed state after removing the external forces .",
    "mathematically , this behavior can be described as follows .",
    "a material response is called elastic if a mapping @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the set of real - valued @xmath33-matrices with positive determinant , exists such that @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is then called the response function .    from now on , we make three restrictions on the possible choices of the response function @xmath36 .",
    "the first one is the general concept of material frame - indifference .",
    "it states that the stress tensors as physical objects have to be invariant with respect to rotations of the observer .",
    "this can be summarized in the axiom of material frame - indifference ( cf .",
    "* axiom 3.3 - 1 ) ) : let q @xmath37 so(3 ) be arbitrarily chosen , then @xmath38 holds for all @xmath35 and @xmath17 . the property of material frame - indifference can also be characterized with the help of the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath36 be the response function to the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor describing an elastic material behavior .",
    "then the material satisfies the axiom of material frame - indifference if and only if @xmath39 holds for all @xmath35 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the second restriction which we make is to consider only isotropic materials .",
    "this means that the material s reaction is not depending on the direction of the external forces .",
    "for example , a composite material with randomly distributed circular micro - structures has an isotropic behavior .",
    "analogously to the material frame - indifference , isotropic material behavior can also be characterized by considering the response function of the material .",
    "let @xmath36 be the response function of the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor .",
    "then , the material behavior is called isotropic if @xmath42 holds for all @xmath35 , @xmath43 and @xmath41 .    the last restriction",
    "we make is to consider only hyperelastic materials .",
    "a material response is called hyperelastic if there exists a stored energy function @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is valid for all @xmath35 and @xmath40 .",
    "the assumption of a hyperelastic material is often made in material modeling because it ensures the thermodynamic consistency of the material law if no dissipation is considered , i.e. for elastic materials ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    for hyperelastic materials ,",
    "the properties of material frame - indifference and isotropy can be characterized by the behavior of the stored energy function . a stored energy function",
    "is called material frame - indifferent and isotropic , respectively , if the corresponding response function defined by is material frame - indifferent and isotropic , respectively . for practical applications these properties",
    "are directly linked to the behavior of the stored energy function by the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath46 be a stored energy function of a hyperelastic material .",
    "then , @xmath46 is material frame - indifferent if and only if @xmath47 holds for all @xmath48 and @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath46 is isotropic if and only if @xmath49 holds for all @xmath48 and @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we assume that the reference configuration of the material is a natural state , i.e. we have @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the unit matrix .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath52 be the green-st.venant strain tensor defined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 its linearization given by @xmath55 then the following representation for the stored energy function can be proven , which will be the basis for the derivation of the basic equations for linear hyperelastic isotropic materials .",
    "consider a material with hyperelastic and isotropic response and let its reference configuration be a natural state . then , there exist real - valued functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 such that the stored energy function @xmath46 of this material can be written as @xmath58 for @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the trace of the matrix @xmath61 .    the function @xmath56 is called first lam parameter and the function @xmath57 is called shear modulus or second lam parameter .",
    "the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 depend on the given material and are determined experimentally .",
    "if only small deformations are considered , it is reasonable to neglect the small-@xmath62 part of and to use the linearization of the green-st.venant strain tensor instead of the full nonlinear tensor .",
    "then , the stored energy function @xmath46 can be approximated by @xmath63 and the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor @xmath28 can be approximated by @xmath64 for so - called linear hyperelastic isotropic materials the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor @xmath28 exactly satisfies @xmath65 which is hooke s law for linear hyperelastic isotropic materials .    by minimizing the energy @xmath66",
    "we will derive the basic equations for linear hyperelastic isotropic materials for the experiment we have in mind , namely a tensile test , see figure [ fig : tt ] .    consider a fixed cartesian coordinate system with an orthonormal basis @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 for @xmath70 and its boundary be decomposed by @xmath71    there are basically two different types of boundary conditions to model a tensile test in a physical reasonable way .",
    "the first possibility is to fix the body on @xmath72 , i.e. to chuck the body at the bottom and top end , while the rest of the body is free to move .",
    "the second possibility are so - called greased boundary conditions . here",
    ", the body is fixed on @xmath72 only against moving in @xmath73 direction , i.e. the deformation of the body in @xmath73 direction is the only prescribed deformation and thus the body can move freely in @xmath74 and @xmath75 direction . again on the remaining surface , the body is free to move .",
    "hence , for a given displacement length @xmath76 , an admissible displacement @xmath77 should satisfy the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath78 : = \\begin{cases }              l , & x_2 = 1 , \\\\              0 , & x_2 = 0 .",
    "\\end{cases }      \\label{eq : dirichlet_boundary}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because even in the simplest case of a homogeneous material , the deformation behavior of a body with the first type of boundary conditions is quite complex and thus hard to analyze , the greased boundary conditions are often preferred .",

    "notice that @xmath87 is chosen such that @xmath88 also satisfies the boundary condition .",

    "next , the above derived three dimensional model is reduced to a two dimensional one by considering the so - called plane stress state ( cf .",
    "the plane - stress assumption , i.e. all occurring stress vectors lie in one plane , is reasonable for @xmath93 very small .",
    "this corresponds to a thin plate , where the thickness is very small compared to the other dimensions .",
    "the main assumption of the plane - stress state is that the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor has the form @xmath94 then implies @xmath95 and therefore @xmath96 this yields @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
