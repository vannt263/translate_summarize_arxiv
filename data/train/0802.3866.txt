    "time - distance helioseismology is based on measuring and inverting acoustic wave travel times between separate points on the surface of the sun .",
    "it is one of widely used approaches of local helioseismology for reconstructing solar subsurface structures and flows .",
    "calculation of the temporal cross - covariance of two oscillation signals , observed in different points on the solar surface , is a key element of this method @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the cross - covariance function for waves with the phase speed lying in a narrow interval can be approximately represented by a gabor wavelet .",
    "the phase and group travel times of acoustic waves can be obtained by fitting the gabor wavelet to the observed cross - covariance function , using a least - square method .",
    "the measured phase travel times are used for inferring the subphotospheric perturbations of the sound ( wave ) speed and flow velocities in the quiet sun and sunspot regions @xcite .",
    "the mean travel time of acoustic waves traveling between two points in the opposite directions are used for determining the sound speed , and the travel time difference is used for determining the flows .",
    "however , an accurate inference of sunspot s subsurface sound - speed structures and flow fields by use of this approach may be affected by a series of physical and unphysical effects , such as strong wave damping in active regions @xcite , and the presence of strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "recently , by using observations of a quiet sun region and artificially reducing solar acoustic oscillation amplitudes , i.e. masking solar wavefield to mimic the sunspot s behavior , @xcite found that this procedure could shift the measured acoustic travel times systematically by an amount of @xmath0 , although such a shift was not expected .",
    "furthermore , they suggested to correct the observed acoustic wavefields inside active regions by artificially increasing the wave amplitude .",
    "however , it is evident that the artificially masked wavefield of a solar quiet region can only mimic the acoustic power of the active region , but not the actual physical cause .",
    "therefore , the systematic errors estimated by this approach may be inaccurate , and the correction procedure is unjustified . in this paper",
    ", we have carried out 3d numerical simulations of solar oscillations based on three different models to mimic the sunspot s wavefield , and investigated the systematic errors caused by the amplitude effects in the time - distance measurements .",
    "these models include the artificial masking the numerically simulated wavefields , as suggested by @xcite , reducing the strength of oscillation sources to reflect the physical effect of reduced excitation in sunspots @xcite , and compare these with effects caused by using a sound - speed perturbation deduced by the previous sound - speed inversions @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulation procedure and results are described in  2 , and the results of the time - distance analysis are given in  3 , followed by discussions in  4 .",
    "propagation of acoustic waves on the sun is described by the system of the linearized euler equations @xmath1 \\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t}}(\\rho_0 { \\mbox{\\boldmath$u$ } } ' ) + { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}}\\;p ' = { \\mbox{\\boldmath$g$}}_0 \\rho ' + { \\mbox{\\boldmath$f$}}(x , y , z , t ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the velocity perturbation , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the density and pressure perturbations respectively , and @xmath5 is the function describing the acoustic sources .",
    "the pressure @xmath6 , density @xmath7 , and gravitational accelerations @xmath8 with subscripts 0 correspond to the background model . to close the system ( [ eq : lineuler ] )",
    "we used the adiabatic relation @xmath9 between lagrangian variations of pressure @xmath10 and density @xmath11 .",
    "the adiabatic exponent @xmath12 is calculated from the realistic opal equation of state @xcite for the hydrogen @xmath13 and heavy elements @xmath14 abundances of the standard model .",
    "the standard solar model s @xcite with a smoothly joined model of the chromosphere of @xcite is used as the background model .",
    "the standard solar model is convectively unstable , especially in the superadiabatic subphotospheric layers where convective motions are very intense and turbulent . using this convectively unstable model as a background model leads to the instability of the solution of the linear system .",
    "the condition for stability against convection requires that the square of brunt - visl frequency @xmath15 is positive . to make the background model convectively stable we replaced all negative values of @xmath16 by zeros and recalculated the profiles of pressure and density from the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this procedure guarantees convective stability of the background model .",
    "it has been shown that the profiles of pressure @xmath6 , density @xmath7 , sound speed @xmath17 , and acoustic cut - off frequency @xmath18 of the modified model are very close to the corresponding profiles of the standard solar model @xcite .",
    "quantity @xmath19 represents the density hight scale .    to prevent spurious reflections of acoustic waves from the boundaries we established non - reflecting boundary conditions based on the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) method @xcite at the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "the top boundary was set at the height of 500 km above the photosphere .",
    "this simulates a realistic situation when not all waves are reflected from the photosphere .",
    "waves with frequencies higher than the acoustic cut - off frequency pass through the photosphere and are absorbed by the top boundary .",
    "this naturally introduces frequency dependence of the reflecting coefficient of the top boundary .",
    "the lateral boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "the details are described by @xcite .",
    "the waves are generated by spatially localized sources of the z - component of force @xmath20 ^ 2 ( 1 - 2\\tau^2)e^{-\\tau^2 } & \\mbox{if}\\quad r\\leq r_{src}\\\\ \\displaystyle 0 & \\mbox{if}\\quad r >",

    "it has a physical meaning of the force density .      to solve the system ( [ eq : lineuler ] ) , a semi - discrete code developed by @xcite is used",
    ". the high - order dispersion relation preserving ( drp ) finite difference ( fd ) scheme of @xcite is used for spatial discretization .",
    "the coefficients of this fd scheme are chosen from the requirement that the error in the fourier transform of the spatial derivative is minimal .",
    "it can be shown that the 4th - order drp fd scheme describes short waves more accurately than the classic 6th - order fd scheme",
    ". a 3rd - order , three - stage strong stability preserving runge - kutta scheme with the courant number , @xmath33 , @xcite is used as a time advancing scheme .    the efficiency of the high - order fd schemes can be reached only if they are combined with adequate numerical boundary conditions .",
    "we followed @xcite and used an implicit pad approximation of the spatial derivatives near the top and bottom boundaries to derive a stable 3rd - order numerical boundary conditions consistent with the 4th - order drp numerical scheme for interior points of the computational domain .    waves with the wavelength less than @xmath34 are not resolved by the fd scheme .",
    "they lead to point - to - point oscillations of the solution that can cause a numerical instability .",
    "such waves have to be filtered out , and we use a 6th - order digital filter to eliminate unresolved short wave component from the solution at each time step .      the simulations are carried out in a rectangular domain of size 90@xmath3590@xmath3531 mm@xmath36 using a uniform 600@xmath35600@xmath35619 grid .",
    "the background model varies sharply in the region above the temperature minimum .",
    "thus , to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves into the chromosphere we choose the vertical spatial step @xmath37 km in order to preserve the accuracy and numerical stability .",
    "the spatial intervals in the horizontal direction are @xmath38 km . to satisfy the courant stability condition for the explicit scheme , the time step is set to be equal to 0.5 seconds .",
    "the sources of the z - component of force with random amplitudes and uniform frequency distribution in the range of @xmath39 mhz are randomly distributed at the depth of 100 km below the photosphere and are independently excited at arbitrary moments of time .",
    "we describe three sets of simulations with different distribution of acoustic sources and different background models .",
    "the first reference model ( model  i ) represents simulations of the acoustic wave field for horizontally uniform distribution of the acoustic sources and the horizontally uniform background model .",
    "this model corresponds to the quiet sun and will be used as a reference state for the following time - distance analysis .",
    "the acoustic travel times for models ii and iii are computed relatively to this reference model .",
    "the goal of this study is to estimate the contributions to the travel times arising from perturbations of the background model and non - uniform distribution of the acoustic sources separately . for this purpose , in model  ii the acoustic source strength",
    "is gradually decreased ( masked ) in the central region , simulating the reduction of the acoustic sources in sunspots @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the horizontal axially symmetric distribution of the acoustic source strength is given by formula @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the horizontal distance from the sunspot axis , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the x- , y- coordinates of the sunspot center and the sunspot radius respectively .",
    "the background model remains unperturbed and horizontally uniform .",
    "so , as far as the background model remains unchanged all deviations of simulated wave field properties from model  i can be explained as a result on non - uniform distribution of the acoustic sources .    strictly speaking , travel times for the cases of uniform distribution of the acoustic sources ( model  i ) and masked source strength ( model  ii ) are calculated at different conditions .",
    "the amplitude of the wave field is uniform in the first case and non - uniform in the second one . to take this into account we mask the _ wave field _ of the model  i by masking function computed by averaging signals azimuthally around the sunspot center",
    "this mimics the reduced amplitude of active regions , just as what was done by @xcite .",
    "the resultant model is called model  ia for the convenience of reference in the following descriptions . although the amplitude distributions now are the same for both wave fields , the wave fields itself are different , because masking of the source strength is not reduced to simple masking of the resulting wave field .",
    "model  iii combines the source masking of model  ii with the sound speed perturbation in sunspots .",
    "the 3d sound - speed profile @xmath45 in model  iii is approximated by the formula @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the vertical profile of the sound speed perturbation at the sunspot axis .",
    "this profile is shown in figure  [ fg1 ] and was calculated from the inversion of helioseismic data for the sunspot observed by soho / mdi on 20 june 1998 @xcite .",
    "the change of the sound - speed perturbation sign from negative to positive at approximately 4 mm below the photosphere is a characteristic feature of this profile .",
    "the depth of inversion divides the domain in vertical direction into two regions with the sound speed greater and smaller than in the standard reference model .",
    "hence , we expect different behavior of waves propagating though this artificial sunspot if their turning points lie in different regions .",
    "the amplitude map of the resulting wave field for model  iii is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fg2 ] .",
    "the solid line in the right panel represents the azimuthally averaged amplitude profile .",
    "the dashed line shows the angularly averaged amplitude profile for model  ii .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the sound speed causes increasing the ratio of oscillation amplitudes outside and inside of the artificial sunspot by about 40% .    the acoustic power spectrum ( @xmath48-@xmath29 diagram ) of the simulated wave field is shown in figure  [ fg3 ] .",
    "we see a good agreement with the observed power spectrum in terms of the shape and locations of power ridges , yet the simulated wave field has more power in high - frequency region .",
    "it is not clear whether such power excess really exists and instrumentally filtered out during observations or it is an artifact of the numerical modeling of the wave field .",
    "the realistic non - linear simulations of solar convection also show a power excess in the @xmath48-@xmath29 diagram at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "for the present study , the high - frequency power excess is unimportant , because for the time - distance helioseismology analysis , we only select the frequency band of 3  4 mhz for analysis , and in this range , the simulated acoustic power is similar to the observations .",
    "to perform the time - distance helioseismology analysis of the simulated data we followed the procedure described in @xcite . for all our models , we select the annuli with radii of @xmath49 mm , @xmath50 mm , and @xmath51 mm to obtain the mean travel times , @xmath52 , and the travel time differences , @xmath53 , ( index @xmath54 marks model number , including the reference model  i ) , which are respectively averages and differences of outgoing and ingoing travel times in the time - distance center - annulus measurement scheme .",
    "a phase - speed filter is applied in each case to select only waves in a narrow phase speed interval . to study the effects caused by wavefield non - uniformity ,",
    "we calculate the differences of @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the analysis .    in figure",
    "[ fg4 ] , we show the maps of the mean travel time perturbations , @xmath57 , the travel time differences , @xmath58 , for all three models .",
    "although the background model of models  ia and ii are the same with the reference model  i , we can see systematic shifts of mean travel times inside the masked regions .    for better understanding the results , it is useful to compare the profiles of the travel time deviations , azimuthally averaged around the sunspot center for both @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as shown in the middle row of figure  [ fg5 ] . obviously , the mean travel time shifts , @xmath59 , are significantly larger in model  ii than in model  ia , although both have exactly the same background model and exactly the same oscillation amplitude reduction in wavefields .",
    "expectedly , model  iii shows mostly positive travel time shifts in contrast with the other two models , and this is obviously due to the negative sound - speed perturbation to the background model in a shallow subsurface region .",
    "one would expect this positive time shift would increase significantly if there is no such effect that causes the time deficit in model  ii , however , it is not immediately clear whether this is the case , or if it is , how much it would increase . for the travel - time difference , @xmath60 , the shifts for all three models are quite small , within an order of 2 sec , substantially smaller than the measured travel time shifts from a real sunspot data @xcite .",
    "the azimuthally averaged @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the other two annuli measurements are also presented in figure  [ fg5 ] . for the shorter travel distances , both models  ia and ii show stronger travel time deficits in the mean travel time measurements compared the the intermediate travel distance case , up to approximately 15 sec for model  ii .",
    "however , model  iii still displays mostly a positive sign , although it displays some dips in the central area where one would expect a stronger positive shift because of the larger negative sound - speed perturbation there .",
    "again , @xmath58 does not show any significant time shifts for all models .",
    "for the larger annulus radius , models  ia and ii do not display significant time shifts , but model  iii displays a significant negative time shift because for this set of measurement , waves reach the depth of a large positive sound - speed perturbation . for this annulus measurement ,",
    "models  ii and iii display an order of magnitude of 5 sec travel time shifts in @xmath60 , larger than those of shorter annuli measurements , but still significantly smaller than the shifts in the real sunspot measurements .      based on their artificial tests with the quiet sun data , in order to remove the measured travel time shifts caused by the oscillation amplitude reductions ,",
    "@xcite have suggested to make corrections for these areas by enlarging the observed oscillation amplitude in active regions .",
    "this procedure is just reverse to the artificial masking .",
    "it obviously works if the power reduction is caused by artificial masking , like in model  ia .",
    "however , it is useful to examine whether this works for the oscillation power reductions that are not caused by surface masking , but physical mechanisms , such as the reduction in the excitation power ( like in models  ii and iii ) .    for each model ( ia , ii , and iii )",
    "we calculate the average amplitude profile and normalized the wavefield by using this profile ( procedure of unmasking the wavefield ) , making the oscillation power nearly uniform over the whole box .",
    "the same time - distance analysis is performed like in  3.1 , and azimuthally averaged curves are displayed in figure  [ fg6 ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that , as expected , this power correction removes all travel time shifts in both @xmath59 and @xmath60 for all annuli measurements for model  ia . for @xmath59 , for the two shorter annuli measurements , the correction slightly lifts both models  ii and iii without changing signs of the profiles , and for the longest annulus , the correction does not change much the measurements . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the correction changes the profiles of models  ii and iii for all annuli , but still , the travel time shifts are within 5 sec or so .",
    "the explanation of the fact that the acoustic travel times depend on the non - uniformness of the wave field amplitude or non - uniform distribution of the source strength is related to the definition of travel times in helioseismology , which have to deal with the stochastic randomly excited oscillations , rather than isolated point sources .",
    "the travel time of a wave packet traveling between two points on the surface is defined not as a local physical quantity , which can be explicitly computed from the background model , but rather in an  observational \" way as a parameter which is obtained from fitting of cross - correlation of the oscillation signals by the gabor wavelet .",
    "thus , it is very important to investigate the effect of non - uniform distribution of acoustic sources , damping and other causes of the non - uniform wave field distribution on the sun .",
    "we have presented the results for some of these effects by using numerical 3d simulations of acoustic wave propagation in various solar models .",
    "we have found that the source masking for horizontally uniform background model ( dashed curves ) may cause a systematic negative shift of about 813 seconds in the mean travel times for short distances ( annuli with radii smaller than 14.5 mm ) .",
    "such travel time shift may cause underestimation of the sound speed perturbation in the shallow ( 12 mm deep ) subsurface layers . for larger distances ,",
    "the contribution to the mean travel time shift becomes negligible . on the contrary ,",
    "the shift of the travel time differences ( due to the non - uniform distribution of the acoustic sources ) is negligible for short distances and has a value about @xmath61 sec for the largest distance used in our experiments .",
    "this is much smaller than perturbations of the travel - time differences observed in real sunspots .",
    "the results of our experiments are different from a similar work by @xcite , where authors report significant disbalance between ingoing and outgoing travel times ( about @xmath61 s for distance of 6.2 mm and about @xmath62 s for distance of 24.35 mm ) , and suggested that at the large distances the false travel time difference signal caused by non - uniform distribution of sources may be misinterpreted as a result of subsurface flows .",
    "however , it is quite clear that , as shown in the first two annuli measurements of figure  [ fg5 ] , the oscillation power deficit due to the source masking may have greatly reduced the travel time shifts measured in model  iii , which means that if doing inversions , the inverted sound - speed profile would be greatly underestimated .",
    "this suggests that the sound - speed profile under sunspots obtained by @xcite got the correct sign but might be underestimated . for the flow fields ,",
    "this masking effect might cause some systematic velocity errors , but only of a very small magnitude .",
    "in addition , our experiments show that the amplitude reduction is caused by the weaker oscillation sources in sunspots can not be corrected by a simple normalization procedure .",
    "this imposes us a difficult task on how to retrieve accurately the sound - speed profiles beneath sunspots , and improve the time - distance helioseismology inferences .",
