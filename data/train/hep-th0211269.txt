    "in the original estimation of the running of coupling constants in grand unified theories @xcite , it was found that the low energy @xmath6 couplings can be unified in a simple gauge group such as @xmath7 @xcite at an energy of about @xmath8 gev .",
    "this energy is suggestively close to the planck mass @xmath9 gev , at least on a log scale .",
    "this hints at a unification that includes gravity as well as the other forces .",
    "subsequently , with more precise measurements of the low energy couplings , it became clear that coupling unification occurs much more precisely in _",
    "grand unification .",
    "supersymmetry raises the unification scale @xmath10 to about @xmath11 gev @xcite , assuming that the running of couplings can be computed using only the known particles plus higgs bosons and superpartners .",
    "incorporating supersymmetry reduces the discrepancy between the unification scale and the planck scale , measured logarithmically , by about one third .    in this discussion",
    ", it is not clear if the unification mass should be compared precisely to @xmath12 or , say , to @xmath13 . for this question to make sense",
    ", one needs a more precise unified theory including gravity .",
    "the first sufficiently precise model was the perturbative @xmath14 heterotic string @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the discrepancy between the scales of grand unification and gravity was again reduced , relative to the original estimates , essentially because the string scale is somewhat below the planck scale .",
    "the remaining discrepancy , evaluated at tree level , is about a factor of 20  that is , the gut or grand unification scale as inferred from low energy couplings is about 20 times smaller than one would expect based on the tree level of the heterotic string . for a discussion , see @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy , which is about six percent on a log scale ( and thus roughly a third as large as the mismatch originally estimated in @xcite ) , is small enough to raise the question of how much the one - loop threshold corrections might close the gap .",
    "the threshold corrections have been calculated @xcite , generalizing the corresponding computations in field theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the threshold corrections depend on the detailed choice of a heterotic string compactification . in most simple models ,",
    "they seem too small to give the desired effect .",
    "an alternative is to assume additional charged particles with masses far below the unification scale , so as to modify the renormalization group estimate of the unification scale . to preserve the usual susy gut prediction for the weak mixing angle @xmath15",
    ", one might limit oneself to complete @xmath7 multiplets ; for assessment of possibilities in this framework , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "another alternative is to consider the _ strongly coupled _",
    "@xmath14 heterotic string , in which an eleventh dimension opens up and gauge fields propagate on the boundaries @xcite . in this case , rather than a prediction for the relation between newton s constant @xmath16 and the scale of grand unification , one gets only an inequality @xcite .",
    "the inequality is difficult to evaluate precisely ; the estimate given in @xcite  is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the kahler form of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath19 , and one would expect the integral in ( [ estom ] )  to be of order @xmath20 times a number fairly close to 1 ; a further estimate was given in @xcite , where this bound was lowered by a factor of 2/3 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath21 is rather close to saturating this inequality and probably does so within the uncertainties",
    ". can be much smaller .",
    "this case was not pursued seriously in @xcite , because of a preference to maintain the successes of grand unification . ] if this inequality , or the one derived in the present paper , is saturated , this is a very interesting statement about nature , but a theoretical reason to expect the inequality to be saturated is not clear .    the purpose of the present paper is to study this and related questions in the context of another related type of model , namely @xmath22-theory compactification on a ( singular ) manifold of @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "such models can be dual to heterotic strings ; in many ( but presumably not all ) instances , a compactification of @xmath22-theory on a @xmath0 manifold @xmath23 is dual to the compactification of a heterotic string on a calabi - yau threefold @xmath19 .",
    "so many models actually have ( at least ) three different dual descriptions : as a perturbative @xmath14 heterotic string ; as a strongly coupled heterotic string with gauge fields on the boundary ; and in terms of @xmath22-theory on a singular @xmath0 manifold .",
    "as in most examples of duality , when one of these descriptions is useful , the others are strongly coupled and difficult to use .    apart from duality with the heterotic string , @xmath0 models that might be relevant to phenomenology can be constructed via duality with certain type ii orientifolds @xcite-@xcite , which in turn may have descriptions via the type i string or @xmath24 heterotic string .",
    "a particular approach to constructing semirealistic particle physics models based on @xmath0 manifolds was described in @xcite . the ability to generate chiral fermions depended on somewhat subtle singularities that have been studied in @xcite - @xcite .",
    "we will pursue this approach further in the present paper .",
    "@xmath0 manifolds are much more difficult and less fully understood than the calabi - yau threefolds that can be used in constructing heterotic string compactifications . however , as we will see , they have at least one nice simplification relative to the generic calabi - yau models : the threshold corrections are rather simple in the case of compactification on a @xmath0 manifold .",
    "they are in fact given by a topological invariant , the ray - singer analytic torsion @xcite,@xcite .",
    "as a result , the threshold corrections can be computed explicitly based on topological assumptions , without needing to know the detailed form of the @xmath0 metric .",
    "that is convenient , since explicit @xmath0 metrics are unknown .    in this paper",
    ", we will carry out for @xmath0 manifolds as much as we can of the usual program of grand unification .",
    "we compute the threshold corrections , obtain as precise an estimate as we can for the radius of compactification , derive the inequality which is analogous to ( [ estom ] ) , and attempt to estimate the proton lifetime .",
    "of course , there is some serious model dependence here ; we attempt to make statements that apply to classes of interesting models .",
    "for example , to discuss proton decay in a sensible fashion , we need to assume a mechanism for doublet - triplet splitting ; here , we assume the mechanism of @xcite  ( which in turn is a close cousin of the original mechanism for doublet - triplet splitting in calabi - yau compactification of the heterotic string @xcite ; this mechanism has been reconsidered recently from a bottom - up point of view @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "one consequence of the particular doublet - triplet splitting mechanism that we use is that dimension five ( or four ) operators contributing to proton decay are absent ; proton decay is dominated , therefore , by dimension six operators . in four dimensions ,",
    "those operators are induced by gauge boson and higgs boson exchange ; we will see that in the present context , in a sense , there is a direct @xmath22-theory contribution .",
    "we will focus in this paper on @xmath7 models , partly for simplicity and partly because the doublet - triplet splitting mechanism of @xcite  has been formulated for this case .",
    "the results we get are as follows :    \\(1 ) for @xmath7 models , the threshold corrections due to kaluza - klein harmonics do not modify the prediction for @xmath15 obtained from four - dimensional supersymmetric gut s .",
    "( this is somewhat analogous to a similar result for massive gauge bosons in four - dimensional @xmath7 models . )",
    "but they do modify the unification scale ; that is , they modify the relation between the compactification scale and the scale of grand unification as estimated from low energy gauge couplings .",
    "this modification is significant in estimating the predictions for newton s constant and for proton decay .",
    "\\(2 ) the inequality analogous to ( [ estom ] )  is again rather close to being saturated and perhaps even more so .",
    "the details depend on the threshold corrections as well as on other factors that will appear in the discussion .",
    "\\(3 ) in four - dimensional susy gut s , the gauge boson exchange contributions to proton decay , if they dominate , lead to a proton lifetime that has been estimated recently as @xmath25 years @xcite .",
    "( four - dimensional gut s also generally have a dimension five contribution that can be phenomenologically troublesome ; it is absent in the models we consider .",
    "see also @xcite for another approach . )",
    "relative to four - dimensional gut s , we find a mechanism that enhances proton decay modes such as replaced by @xmath26 , or @xmath27 by @xmath28 . as in most four - dimensional gut s",
    ", we do not have precise knowledge of the flavor structure . ]",
    "@xmath5 relative to @xmath3 or @xmath29 ; these are typical modes that arise from gauge boson exchange . given numerical uncertainties that will appear in section 5 ,",
    "it is hard to say if in practice this mechanism enhances the @xmath5 modes relative to gut s or suppresses the others .",
    "because of these issues , to cite a very rough estimate of the proton lifetime , we somewhat arbitrarily keep the central value estimated in the four - dimensional models and double the logarithmic uncertainty , so that the proton lifetime in these models if gauge boson exchange dominates might be @xmath30 years .",
    "is @xmath31 years ( for a recent report , see @xcite ) and the next generation of experiments may improve this by a factor of 10 to 20 ( for example , see @xcite ) . ]",
    "( in practice , the uncertainty could be much larger if because of additional light charged particles , the unification scale is modified ; the same statement applies to four - dimensional gut models . )",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review how semi - realistic models of particle physics can be obtained by compactification of @xmath22-theory on a singular manifold of @xmath0 holonomy . in section 3",
    ", we express the threshold corrections in terms of ray - singer torsion and make everything completely explicit in the case of a lens space . in section 4 ,",
    "we work out the implications for newton s constant . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss proton decay . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss some unresolved issues about these models .",
    "finally , in the appendices , we do some calculations of torsion to fill in some loose ends in section 3 .",
    "as we will now recall , duality with the heterotic string implies that semi - realistic models of particle physics can be derived by compactification of @xmath22-theory on a manifold of @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "( one could also use type ii orientifolds as the starting point here @xcite-@xcite . ) semi - realistic means that gauge groups and fermion quantum numbers come out correctly , but there is no good understanding of things that depend on supersymmetry breaking , like the correct fixing of moduli , as well as fermion masses ( which depend on the moduli ) .",
    "in fact , semi - realistic models of particle physics can be derived by compactification of the @xmath14 heterotic string on a calabi - yau threefold @xmath19 .",
    "most calabi - yau threefolds participate in mirror symmetry .",
    "mirror symmetry is interpreted to mean @xcite that in a suitable region of its moduli space , @xmath19 is fibered over a three - manifold @xmath32 with fibers that are generically copies of a three - torus @xmath33 .    now , we take @xmath32 to be very large in string units , while keeping the size of the @xmath33 fixed and taking the string coupling constant to infinity . the strong coupling limit of the heterotic string on @xmath33",
    "is @xmath22-theory on k3 .",
    "so in this limit , we replace all of the @xmath33 s by k3 s .",

    "when we want to be specific , we consider @xmath36 , in which case @xmath32 is a locus of @xmath38 orbifold singularities .",
    "this means , concretely , that the normal space to @xmath32 in @xmath23 can be parametrized locally by complex coordinates @xmath39 @xmath40 with the identification @xmath41    though our focus in this paper is on the case that @xmath35 is simple , we briefly note that if @xmath35 is semi - simple , this means that the k3 contains several disjoint singularities , one for each factor in @xmath35 .",
    "these will lead , generally , to different components of the singular set of @xmath23 .",
    "( they might intersect , in which case chiral superfields may be supported at the points of intersection . ) also , @xmath42 factors in @xmath35 appear in @xmath22-theory as modes of the three - form field @xmath43 of @xmath22-theory",

    "another class of models arises from type ii orientifolds @xcite -@xcite ; in this case , the radius of the @xmath22-theory circle is a factor in the volume of @xmath23 but not of @xmath32 , so again @xmath48 when the duality can be used to deduce the existence of @xmath23 .",

    "we have used translation invariance to place one current at the origin , and @xmath332 is the propagator of the heavy gauge bosons that transform as @xmath333 of @xmath103 . because the proton is so large compared to the range of @xmath82 that contributes appreciably in the integral , we can replace @xmath334 by @xmath335 , and then use @xmath336 ( with @xmath22 the mass of the heavy gauge bosons ) to reduce ( [ dorry ] )  to @xmath337 ( [ torry ] )  is a direct consequence of the equation for the propagator , which is @xmath338 with @xmath339 the laplacian .",
    "of course , in deriving ( [ torry ] ) , we should be careful in defining the operator product @xmath340 ; doing so leads to some renormalization group corrections to the above tree level derivation .",
    "these can be treated the same way in four dimensions and in the @xmath0-based models , and hence need not concern us here .    in @xmath55 ,",
    "the idea is similar , except that the currents are localized at specific points on @xmath32 , which we will call @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "the gauge boson propagator is a function @xmath343 with @xmath344 , and @xmath345 ; the equation it obeys is @xmath346 here @xmath347 is the laplacian on @xmath54 , acting on the @xmath82 variable , and similarly @xmath348 is the laplacian on @xmath32 , acting on @xmath349 .",
    "now we set @xmath349 and @xmath350 to be two of the special points @xmath341 and @xmath342 on @xmath32 ( with enhanced singularities in the normal directions ) at which chiral matter fields are supported .",
    "the analog of ( [ dorry ] )  is @xmath351 where we have used translation invariance to set @xmath352 . again , because the proton is so large compared to the range of @xmath82 that contributes significantly to the integral , we can set @xmath82 to 0 in @xmath353 , giving us @xmath354 now it follows from ( [ gugu ] )  that the function @xmath355 obeys @xmath356 in other words , @xmath71 is the green s function of the scalar laplacian on @xmath32 ( for scalar fields valued in the @xmath333 representation ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 is bounded for @xmath349 away from @xmath350 , and for @xmath357 , @xmath358 more exactly , this is the contribution for fermions living at the points @xmath341 , @xmath342 .",
    "it must be summed over possible @xmath68 .    given ( [ urryco ] )",
    ", if it is possible to have @xmath341 very close to @xmath342 , this will give the dominant contribution .",
    "but how close will the @xmath68 be ?",
    "the smallest that the denominator in ( [ urryco])will get is if @xmath359 , in other words if the currents @xmath360 and @xmath361 in the proton decay process act on the same @xmath256 or @xmath362 of @xmath7 , living at some point @xmath363 on @xmath32 . if this is the case , then the result ( [ nugu])is infinite .",
    "@xmath22-theory will cut off this infinity , but we do not know exactly how .",
    "the best we can say is that the cutoff will occur at a distance of order the eleven - dimensional planck length , as this is the only scale that is relevant in studying the conical singularity at @xmath349 . if we naively say that setting @xmath359 means replacing @xmath364 by @xmath365 ( with @xmath366 the eleven - dimensional planck length ; @xmath123 was evaluated in ( [ incoc ] ) ) , then we would replace @xmath367 by @xmath368 . unfortunately ,",
    "as noted at the end of section 4 , we have no idea whether @xmath123 or some multiple of it is the natural cutoff in @xmath22-theory .",
    "this is an important uncertainty , since ( for example ) @xmath369 is a relatively large number and the proton decay rate is proportional to the square of the amplitude !",
    "all we can say is that the effective value of @xmath367 , though uncalculable with the present understanding of @xmath22-theory , is model - independent ; it does not depend on the details of @xmath23 or @xmath32 , but is a universal property of @xmath22-theory with the conical singularity @xmath349 .",
    "the effective interaction is @xmath370 where @xmath43 is a constant that in principle depends only on @xmath22-theory and not the specific model .",
    "so @xmath43 might conceivably be computed in the future ( if better methods are discovered ) without knowing how to pick the right model .",
    "we have made explicit the fact that the interaction is summed over all possibilities for @xmath363 .",
    "subleading ( and model - dependent ) contributions with @xmath371 have not been written .",
    "let us compare this to the situation in four - dimensional gut s .",
    "the currents @xmath330 and @xmath331 receive contributions from particles in the @xmath256 and @xmath362 of @xmath7",
    ". thus we can expand @xmath372 among these terms , the @xmath373 operator product contributes to @xmath374 , @xmath375 does not contribute to proton decay , and the cross terms contribute to @xmath3 and @xmath376 .",
    "assuming that the points supporting @xmath256 s are distinct from the points supporting @xmath377 s , the above mechanism , in comparison to four - dimensional gut s , enhances the decay @xmath5 relative to the others .    using the formulas in section 4",
    ", we can evaluate the product @xmath378 .",
    "reading off @xmath379 from ( [ gloko ] )  and @xmath123 from ( [ incoc ] ) , we find that the effective interaction is @xmath380 the equivalent formula in four - dimensional gut s is @xmath381 where the superscript @xmath267 refers to the total current for all fermion multiplets .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 is the mass of the color triplet gauge bosons , and so may not coincide with @xmath10 , which is the unification scale as deduced from the low energy gauge couplings ; in some simple four - dimensional models , the ratio @xmath382 is computable .",
    "the above formulas show that , in principle , the decay amplitude for @xmath5 in the @xmath0-based theory is enhanced as @xmath383 by a factor of @xmath321 relative to the corresponding gut amplitude .",
    "the enhancement means that , in some sense , in the models considered here , proton decay is not purely a gauge theory phenomenon but a reflection of @xmath22-theory .    in practice , in nature , @xmath321 is not such a big number . whether the effect we have described is really an enhancement of @xmath5 or a suppression of the other decays depends largely on the unknown @xmath22-theory constant @xmath43 .",
    "the factor @xmath384 can also be significant numerically .",
    "for example , for the simplest lens space , with the minimal choice @xmath385 , @xmath386 , we get @xmath387 , whence @xmath388 .",
    "even if @xmath43 and the other factors in ( [ infof ] )  were all known , the proton lifetime would also depend on how the light quarks and leptons are distributed among the different @xmath68 , or equivalently , how they are distributed among the different @xmath389 s of @xmath7 .",
    "the same remark applies in four - dimensional gut s : the proton decay rate can be reduced by mixing of quarks and leptons among themselves as well as with other multiplets , including multiplets that have gut - scale masses .",
    "the arrangement of the different quarks and leptons among the @xmath68 will also affect the flavor structure of proton decay .",
    "what we have referred to as @xmath390 will also contain an admixture of other modes with @xmath391 replaced by @xmath26 , and/or @xmath27 replaced by @xmath28 . as in four - dimensional gut s , these relative decay rates are model - dependent .",
    "finally , in this concluding section , we will explain some of the difficulties in making a realistic model of physics based on the class of models that we have been exploring .",
    "one key cluster of issues is common to all known string and @xmath22-theory approaches to phenomenology .",
    "these center around the need for a good mechanism of supersymmetry breaking that solves problems such as the susy flavor problem , the smallness of the cosmological constant , and the high degree of stability of the vacuum we live in .",
    "we will not say anything here about these general issues , and instead focus on issues that are more or less special to the particular @xmath0 framework .    in the models described in @xcite  and further explored here , @xmath7",
    "multiplets @xmath255 containing higgs bosons , quarks and leptons , and possibly messengers of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking are supported at points @xmath68 on @xmath32 . as long as the @xmath68 are distinct , superpotential interactions that ultimately lead to quark and lepton masses come from membrane instanton corrections and hence are exponentially small as @xmath392 .",
    "( for a study of superpotentials from membrane instantons on smooth @xmath0 manifolds , see @xcite . )",
    "in fact , the membrane action scales as @xmath393 , and hence , since we saw in section four that @xmath394 , the membrane action scales as @xmath322 if all lengths in @xmath23 are scaled the same way .",
    "we would need to know details about @xmath23 in order to compute the coefficients of @xmath322 for various membrane instantons , so it is hard to be specific here . on the plus side of the ledger , small changes in membrane instanton actions",
    "could produce a wide range of quark and lepton masses , such as is seen in nature .",
    "quarks and leptons of the first two generations  and especially the first  have very small masses , but probably not as small as one might get from a membrane instanton with an action of order @xmath322 if we take the usual value @xmath395 so it is probably necessary to assume that , because of extra @xmath7 multiplets that survive below the gut scale , @xmath1 is significantly larger than the usual estimate . for a proposal with extra light vector - like matter leading to @xmath396 , see @xcite  .",
    "( we recall that at least some extra light vector - like matter  possibly serving as messengers of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking  is needed in the doublet - triplet splitting framework of @xcite  because of certain anomalies .",
    "see also @xcite . )",
    "the top quark mass is so large that it is not plausible to interpret it as being subject to any exponential suppression at all .",
    "so we might want to assume that the point @xmath341 that supports a higgs @xmath65 of @xmath7 coincides with the point @xmath342 that supports one of the @xmath256 s . in a case with such multiple singularities ,",
    "one obtains a superpotential coupling ( hopefully @xmath397 in this example ) that is `` of order one , '' with no exponential suppression at all .",
    "( this is shown in an example in @xcite . )",
    "this might give us a large top quark mass .",
    "however , if we want to split higgs doublets and triplets using the mechanism described in @xcite , we really must take the higgs @xmath398 to be supported at a point @xmath399 that is distinct from @xmath341 and @xmath342 ( in fact , @xmath399 and @xmath341 lie on different components of the fixed point set of the global symmetry that leads to doublet - triplet splitting ) .",
    "so the bottom quark mass presumably has at least some exponential suppression involving a membrane instanton action . since @xmath400 , which is not all that small , and @xmath401 can be suppressed by large @xmath402 in supersymmetric models as well as by a large membrane instanton action , in practice",
    "we will have to suppose that @xmath402 is not too large and than a certain membrane instanton has rather small action .",
    "light neutrino masses come from dimension five superpotential couplings ( of the form @xmath403 , with @xmath126 and @xmath404 being higgs boson and lepton doublets ) , which again arise from membrane instantons , or possibly by integrating out a heavy singlet ( `` right - handed neutrino '' ) .",
    "so it is necessary to arrange that the membrane instanton generating the @xmath405 coupling has rather small action , or that the heavy singlet is sufficiently light and sufficiently strongly coupled to @xmath126 and @xmath404 .",
    "( the singlet mass and couplings to @xmath406 both come from membrane instantons . )",
    "since the @xmath7 relation @xmath407 , which is converted by renormalization group running to the weak scale to something more like @xmath408 @xcite , is fairly successful , we presumably want to preserve this relation by avoiding significant mixing of the third generation with other multiplets .",
    "since analogous relations for the first two genreations are not successful , we probably do want mixing of the first two generations with other multiplets that have large masses ( the use of such mixing to modify fermion mass relations was recalled in @xcite ) .",
    "it is consistent to have significant mixing of the first two generations with other multiplets while avoiding such mixing for the third generation , because the observed values of the ckm quark mixing angles suggest that ( except for neutrinos ) the mixing of the third generation with the first two is very tiny .",
    "we do not have a good mechanism that would split off the third generation in this way .    finally , we come to the question of whether the higgs triplet mass @xmath269 can really be as light as suggested in ( [ guny ] ) . in four - dimensional gut s",
    "this might lead to trouble because of proton decay interactions mediated by the higgs triplets . in the present context",
    ", the doublet - triplet splitting mechanism of @xcite  implies that , because of an exotic discrete symmetry , the higgs triplet exchange does not generate dimension five operators .",
    "we also have to worry about dimension six operators mediated by the higgs triplets ; these are unavoidable , and give proton decay amplitudes proportional to @xmath409 , where the @xmath410 are yukawa couplings of the higgs triplet to quarks and leptons .",
    "the @xmath410 would plausibly be of order @xmath411 , where @xmath412 is a first or second generation quark and lepton mass and @xmath413 is the @xmath414 boson mass .",
    "since the ratios @xmath411 range from roughly @xmath415 to @xmath416 , with values closer to @xmath415 for the quarks that are part of the initial state in a proton decay process , this is plausibly enough suppression so that we can accept a higgs triplet mass as low as @xmath416 @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , such a higgs triplet might not dominate proton decay , leaving the mechanism explored in section 5 as the dominant mechanism .",
