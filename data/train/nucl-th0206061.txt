    "in a series of papers @xcite , we have reported quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations of ground and low - lying excited state energies in @xmath8 nuclei for realistic nuclear hamiltonians .",
    "these calculations employed the argonne @xmath1 ( av18 ) two - nucleon potential @xcite and the urbana ix ( uix ) three - nucleon potential @xcite , and are accurate to @xmath9 of the binding energy for light p - shell nuclei .",
    "more recently , we have used the quantum monte carlo calculations to help construct a series of new and improved pion - exchange - based three - nucleon potentials , designated the illinois models @xcite .",
    "the five illinois models ( il1-il5 ) , when used in conjunction with av18 , each reproduce the experimental energies of 17 narrow states in @xmath8 nuclei with an rms deviation of @xmath10 kev .",
    "this contrasts with a 2.3 mev rms deviation for the av18/uix hamiltonian , and 7.7 mev for av18 alone .    in this paper , we report the extension of our qmc calculations to @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the qmc methods include both variational ( vmc ) and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods .",
    "the vmc method is used to construct a variational wave function as a product of two and three - body correlation operators acting on a independent - particle wave function that has an @xmath2-like core and multiple p - shell nucleons , @xmath3-coupled to the appropriate @xmath4 quantum numbers for the state of interest .",
    "monte carlo evaluation of the energy expectation value is used to optimize the trial function , particularly the mix of independent - particle wave function components .",
    "the gfmc method starts from this trial function and makes a euclidean propagation that converges to the lowest energy for a state of these quantum numbers .",
    "a constrained path algorithm is crucial for keeping the fermion sign problem under control . at present the gfmc method is used to calculate only the lowest state of given @xmath4 .",
    "we have calculated ten stable or very narrow natural - parity states in the @xmath0 nuclei @xmath5li , @xmath5be , @xmath6be , and @xmath6b that are experimentally well known .",
    "we use three of the new illinois models ( il2 , il3 , il4 ) in conjunction with av18 and obtain rms deviations from the experimental energies of the states of 900 , 1100 , and 1700 kev , respectively .",
    "we have also calculated most of these states with the av18 and av18/uix hamiltonians for comparison .",
    "the most intriguing result we find is that the new av18/il2-il4 models all correctly predict a 3@xmath7 ground state for @xmath6b , but the older models wrongly predict a 1@xmath7 ground state .",
    "in addition , we have made gfmc calculations of six other states that are expected within the p - shell formulation of these nuclei and of the @xmath5he and @xmath6he ground states ; these states either have much larger widths or are not clearly identified by experiment .",
    "we review briefly the experimental status of the ground and low - lying excited states in the @xmath0 nuclei in sec .",
    "the hamiltonians are described in sec .",
    "iii and the qmc calculations in sec .",
    "most of this material has been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "the only major new technical development is the automation of the construction of the independent - particle portion of the variational trial wave functions that serve as starting points for the gfmc calculations .",
    "energy results are given in sec .",
    "v , while electromagnetic moments and density distributions are shown in sec .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "the experimental status of @xmath0 nuclei is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] , where we show the ground states and most low - lying natural - parity states whose spin assignments are reasonably certain  @xcite .",
    "we also show some additional narrow states in @xmath5li and @xmath6be whose spins have not been determined experimentally ; reasonable guesses are given in parentheses , based on standard shell model studies and the present calculations .",
    "the ground state of @xmath5be is an absolutely stable @xmath11 state .",
    "the first excitation is a @xmath12 state ( not shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] ) with a width of 217 kev which occurs at the threshold for breakup into @xmath13 .",
    "this unnatural parity state is beyond the scope of the present paper ; we will report calculations of such intruder states in the future .",
    "the second excitation is a narrow @xmath14 state at 2.429 mev , with a width @xmath15 kev . within the p - shell formulation",
    ", there can also be @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 states .",
    "experimentally , the first two are observed at 2.78 and 6.38 mev excitation but both are quite broad ( @xmath19 mev ) , while no state with @xmath18 character has been identified .",
    "we evaluate all these @xmath4 cases in gfmc , treating the states as if they were particle stable ; this should be adequate for narrow states , but may be less satisfactory for broad states .",
    "( several additional unnatural parity states and second excited states of given @xmath4 are observed above 3 mev , but are not shown in the figure . )",
    "the matrix elements of the electromagnetic and strong charge - independence - breaking terms in the hamiltonian are evaluated perturbatively to infer the energies of the narrow @xmath20 isobaric analog states in @xmath5b .",
    "the ground state of @xmath5li is a particle stable ( @xmath21 ) state that decays by @xmath22 emission to @xmath5be with a half - life of 178 ms .",
    "the first excited state of @xmath5li at 2.691 mev is believed to be a ( @xmath23 ) state ; it is below the threshold for breakup into @xmath24 and decays only by @xmath25 emission .",
    "we calculate both these states in @xmath5li , and again perturbatively evaluate the energies of the isobaric analogs in @xmath5be , @xmath5b , and @xmath5c .",
    "two additional narrow states above the breakup threshold have been observed in @xmath5li , but without firm spin - parity identification : a 60 kev wide state at 4.296 mev and a 40 kev wide state at 6.43 mev . within the p - shell ,",
    "these should be ( @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 ) states ; our gfmc evaluations of such states line up very well with the experimental observations , suggesting these spin assignments may indeed be correct .",
    "the ground state of @xmath6b is an absolutely stable ( 3@xmath7;0 ) state .",
    "the first threshold for breakup of @xmath6b is into @xmath28li+@xmath2 . between the ground state and breakup threshold are two ( 1@xmath7;0 ) excited states at 0.718 mev and 2.154 mev , one ( 2@xmath7;0 ) state at 3.587 mev , and the ( 0@xmath7;1 ) isobaric analog of @xmath6be at 1.740 mev .",
    "many additional states are known above the @xmath28li+@xmath2 threshold ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we show only the ( 2@xmath7;1 ) isobaric analog at 5.164 mev and the ( 4@xmath7;0 ) state at 6.025 mev .",
    "we calculate the ( 3@xmath7;0 ) ground state and first ( 1@xmath7;0 ) , ( 2@xmath7;0 ) , and ( 4@xmath7;0 ) excitations by gfmc . in the p - shell",
    "there can also be ( 0@xmath7;0 ) and ( 5@xmath7;0 ) states , but the former is of low spatial symmetry while the latter has high angular momentum , leading us to expect both of them to be quite high in excitation energy ; no experimental observation of either has been made .",
    "the nucleus @xmath6be is particle - stable but decays by @xmath22 emission with the very long half - life of @xmath29 years . as is typical for an even - even nucleus , the ground state is a ( 0@xmath7;1 ) state , and",
    "there is a well - separated ( 2@xmath7;1 ) excited state at 3.368 mev .",
    "these are the two primary @xmath6be states we evaluate in gfmc .",
    "in addition , the tabulation lists a state at 9.4 mev as a possible ( 2@xmath7;1 ) state , but a more recent ( t,@xmath30he ) experiment makes a ( 3@xmath7;1 ) assignment more likely  @xcite .",
    "we have made one computation for the ( 3@xmath7;1 ) level using av18/il2 and get reasonable agreement with this energy .",
    "other particle - stable states below the threshold for breakup into @xmath5be+@xmath31 include second ( 0@xmath7;1 ) and ( 2@xmath7;1 ) states , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , and the first particle - stable ( 1@xmath32;1 ) and ( 2@xmath32;1 ) intruder states ( not shown ) .",
    "the second excited states are not evaluated at present in gfmc , while the intruder states will be reported on in future work .",
    "again , the isobaric analog states in @xmath6b and @xmath6c are evaluated perturbatively from @xmath6be .",
    "in addition to these nuclei , we have also made calculations of the expected lowest natural - parity states in @xmath5he and @xmath6he .",
    "these are a @xmath33 resonance which is observed at @xmath34 mev above the threshold for breakup into @xmath35he+@xmath31 , and a @xmath36 resonance at @xmath37 mev above the @xmath35he+@xmath31+@xmath31 threshold @xcite .",
    "these resonances are observed to be reasonably narrow , with widths of 100 and @xmath38 kev , respectively .",
    "there are recent experimental reports of a @xmath39 resonance near threshold in @xmath5he  @xcite , which we have not attempted to calculate ; such a state is likely to be very broad and really needs to be treated as a scattering state .",
    "we also have not attempted to calculate the resonant ground state of @xmath6li , which is broad and still has some experimental uncertainty .",
    "the hamiltonian includes nonrelativistic one - body kinetic energy , the av18 two - nucleon potential  @xcite and either the uix  @xcite or one of the illinois  @xcite three - nucleon potentials : @xmath40 the kinetic energy operator is predominantly charge - independent ( ci ) , but has a small charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) component due to the difference between proton and neutron masses .",
    "the av18 is one of a class of highly accurate @xmath41 potentials that fit both @xmath42 and @xmath43 scattering data up to 350 mev with a @xmath44datum @xmath19 .",
    "it can be written as a sum of electromagnetic and one - pion - exchange terms and a shorter - range phenomenological part : @xmath45 the electromagnetic terms include one- and two - photon - exchange coulomb interaction , vacuum polarization , darwin - foldy , and magnetic moment terms , all with appropriate proton and neutron form factors . the one - pion - exchange part of the potential includes the small charge - dependent ( cd ) terms due to the difference in neutral and charged pion masses .",
    "the shorter - range part has about 40 parameters which are adjusted to fit the @xmath42 and @xmath43 scattering data , the deuteron binding energy , and also the @xmath46 scattering length .",
    "the one - pion - exchange and the remaining phenomenological part of the potential can be written as a sum of eighteen operators , @xmath47 the first fourteen ci operators are @xmath48\\otimes[1,{\\bf\\tau}_{i}\\cdot{\\bf\\tau}_{j } ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the last four , @xmath49\\otimes t_{ij } , \\ \\tau_{zi}+\\tau_{zj } \\ , \\ ] ] are the strong interaction cd and csb terms .",
    "the three - nucleon potentials from the urbana series of models  @xcite contain a long - range , two - pion - exchange , p - wave term and a short - range phenomenological piece : @xmath50 the uix model has the strengths of these two terms adjusted to reproduce the binding energy of @xmath30h , in gfmc calculations , and to give a reasonable saturation density in nuclear matter , in variational chain summation calculations  @xcite , when used with av18 .",
    "the illinois models add a two - pion - exchange s - wave term and a three - pion - ring term : @xmath51 the two - pion - exchange s - wave term is required by chiral symmetry , but in practice its small energy contribution makes it hard to distinguish from the dominant p - wave term .",
    "however , the three - pion - ring term , while it is smaller than the two - pion - exchange p - wave term , has a distinctly different isospin dependence , which is crucial for being able to fit the variety of light p - shell energy levels studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the illinois models ,",
    "the operator structure and radial forms were taken from standard meson - exchange theory , but the overall strengths of the four terms , and one cutoff factor in the radial dependence , were adjusted to obtain best fits to the energies of 17 narrow states in @xmath52 nuclei . in practice , at most three parameters at a time could be uniquely determined from the energy calculations , so five different models were constructed in which different subsets of the parameters were fixed by external considerations , while the remaining ones were adjusted .",
    "the cd and csb terms in @xmath53 are fairly weak , so we can treat them conveniently as a first - order perturbation and use a wave function of good isospin , which is significantly more compact . also , direct gfmc calculations with the spin - dependent terms that involve the square of the orbital angular momentum operator can have large statistical fluctuations , as discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "thus it is useful to define  @xcite a simpler isoscalar interaction , av8@xmath54 , which contains only the eight operators @xmath55 \\otimes[1,{\\bf\\tau}_{i}\\cdot{\\bf\\tau}_{j}]$ ] and an isoscalar coulomb interaction .",
    "these eight operators are chosen such that av8@xmath54 reproduces the ci part of the full av18 interaction in all s and p waves as well as the deuteron . the av8@xmath54 interaction ( without the coulomb term )",
    "was recently used in a benchmark test of seven different many - body methods for solving the four - nucleon bound state , with excellent agreement between gfmc and the other calculations  @xcite .",
    "we first construct a variational wave function for the state of interest and then optimize it by minimizing the energy expectation value as computed by metropolis monte carlo integration .",
    "the variational wave function for the nuclei studied here has the form @xmath56 the @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are noncommuting two- and three - nucleon correlation operators , and @xmath59 is a symmetrization operator .",
    "the @xmath57 includes spin , isospin , and tensor terms induced by the two - nucleon potential , while the @xmath58 reflects the structure of the dominant parts of the three - nucleon interaction .",
    "this trial function has the advantage of being efficient to evaluate while including the bulk of the correlation effects .",
    "a more sophisticated variational function can be constructed by including two - body spin - orbit correlations and additional three - body correlations , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the time to compute these extra terms is significant , while the gain in the variational energy is relatively small .",
    "studies have shown that the gfmc algorithm easily corrects for the omission of these terms  @xcite .",
    "the two - body correlations are generated by the solution of coupled differential equations with embedded variational parameters @xcite .",
    "we have found that the parameters optimized for the @xmath2-particle are near optimal for use in the light p - shell nuclei .",
    "likewise , the best parameters for the three - body correlations are remarkably constant for different s- and p - shell nuclei , so they have not been changed significantly from the previous @xmath8 work @xcite .    for the p - shell nuclei studied here",
    ", the totally antisymmetric jastrow wave function , @xmath60 , starts with a sum over independent - particle terms , @xmath61 , that have 4 nucleons in an @xmath2-like core and @xmath62 nucleons in p - shell orbitals .",

    ". however , for @xmath6be , these extra components can give significant additional binding of up to 3 mev .",
    "in this case , the extra states correspond to low - lying excitations that may not be filtered out of the trial function by a gfmc propagation to limited @xmath127 , as discussed below .",
    "thus it is crucial to carry out the diagonalization in the trial function to get an optimal starting point for the gfmc calculation .",
    "the @xmath128 nuclei are exactly midway through the p - shell and are unique in having two linearly independent states of the same spatial symmetry contribute , i.e. , two @xmath129d[42 ] states in @xmath6be and two @xmath30d[42 ] states in @xmath6b .",
    "to uniquely identify these two possible combinations , we diagonalize jastrow trial functions containing just the two @xmath130d[42 ] states in the quadrupole moment operator , so the first @xmath119}$ ] amplitude reported in tables  [ tab : b10][tab : be10 ] for each state corresponds to the lower ( negative ) quadrupole eigenvalue and the second to the higher ( positive ) quadrupole eigenvalue .",
    "interestingly , we see that most states where these two symmetries contribute are dominated by either one amplitude or the other , e.g. , the first 3@xmath7 in @xmath6b is almost pure positive quadrupole while the second 3@xmath7 is almost pure negative quadrupole in composition .",
    "similarly the first 2@xmath7 in @xmath6be is almost pure negative quadrupole while the second is pure positive quadrupole .",
    "this is analogous to using the @xmath131 labeling scheme applied to @xmath6b by kurath in a traditional shell model calculation  @xcite , and there is good agreement as to the dominant [ 42 ] symmetry amplitudes with his table  3 . only the first 2@xmath7 state in @xmath6b does not seem to fit in with these observations .",

    ", @xmath160 for brevity , @xmath161 is given by @xmath162 with the integral being evaluated stochastically .",
    "the short - time propagator is constructed with the exact two - body propagator and additional terms coming from the three - body interaction .",
    "quantities of interest are evaluated in terms of a `` mixed '' expectation value between @xmath163 and @xmath149 : @xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the ` path ' , and @xmath166 with the integral over the paths being carried out stochastically .",
    "the desired expectation values would , of course , have @xmath149 on both sides ; by writing @xmath167 and neglecting terms of order @xmath168 ^ 2 $ ] , we obtain the approximate expression @xmath169 ~ , \\label{eq : pc_gfmc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath170 is the variational expectation value .",
    "a special case is the expectation value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath171 can be re - expressed as @xmath172 since the propagator @xmath173 $ ] commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "thus @xmath171 approaches @xmath145 in the limit @xmath174 , and the expectation value obeys the variational principle for all @xmath127 .",
    "as mentioned above , the propagation is actually made with a simplified hamiltonian @xmath175 that includes the ci kinetic energy operator , the av8@xmath54 two - nucleon interaction including isoscalar coulomb , and a slightly altered @xmath176 three - nucleon interaction .",
    "the av8@xmath54 is a little more attractive than av18 , so a slightly more repulsive @xmath176 is used to keep @xmath177 .",
    "this ensures the gfmc algorithm will not propagate to excessively large densities due to overbinding .",
    "consequently , the upper bound property applies to @xmath178 , and @xmath179 must be evaluated perturbatively .",
    "another complication that arises in the gfmc algorithm is the `` fermion sign problem '' .",
    "this arises from the stochastic evaluation of the matrix elements in eq.([eq : expectation ] ) .",
    "the monte carlo techniques used to calculate the path integrals leading to @xmath180 involve only local properties , while antisymmetry is a global property .",
    "thus the propagation can mix in the boson solution .",
    "this has a ( much ) lower energy than the fermion solution and thus is exponentially amplified in subsequent propagations . in the final integration with the antisymmetric @xmath163 , the desired fermionic part is projected out , but in the presence of large statistical errors that grow exponentially with @xmath127 . because the number of pairs that can be exchanged grows with @xmath68 , the sign problem also grows exponentially with increasing @xmath68 . for @xmath181 ,",
    "the errors grow so fast that convergence in @xmath127 can not be achieved .",
    "to remedy this situation , a `` constrained path '' approximation has been developed  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the constrained - path method is to discard those configurations that , in future generations , will contribute only noise to expectation values .",
    "many tests of the constrained path have been made and it usually gives results that are consistent with unconstrained propagation , within statistical errors , although there are cases in which it converges to the wrong energy  @xcite .",
    "up to now , this problem was always solved by using a small number , @xmath182 to 20 , of unconstrained steps before evaluating expectation values .",
    "these few unconstrained steps , out of 400 or more total steps , were enough to damp out errors introduced by the constraint in all the tests that we had done .",
    "the statistical errors in calculations with @xmath182 are not substantially greater than for @xmath183 .",
    "however for @xmath128 , the error from @xmath184 is 6090% larger than that from @xmath182 , i.e. , 2.53.5 more configurations must be used to get the same error . in the present work , we find that @xmath0 calculations with the av18/il3 hamiltonian ( which has the strongest long - range part of @xmath185 ) are particularly sensitive to @xmath186 , and most of these are made with @xmath184 .",
    "tests made with the other hamiltonians show that @xmath182 is enough , except for @xmath187he .    previously  @xcite we had found that obtaining reliable results for @xmath35he was particularly difficult . in the present work we find that this persists for @xmath187he which show large statistical fluctuations .",
    "in addition the constrained - path method appears to be less reliable than for other nuclei . for example",
    ", we made a calculation for @xmath6he with av18/il2 and a @xmath163 that contained no @xmath188 correlation . even though @xmath184 was used ,",

    "( in ref .",
    "@xcite a calculation of @xmath28li with a much worse @xmath163 , which contained no @xmath189 tensor correlations , also gave an overbound result but this was corrected with only @xmath182 . )",
    "the statistical errors using @xmath190 are very large , making a confirmation of the @xmath184 results presented here difficult ; we have attempted this for av18/il2 and obtain no significant change in the binding energy within a statistical error of 0.7 mev .",
    "figure [ fig:10b - e_of_tau ] shows the progress with increasing @xmath127 of typical constrained gfmc calculations , in this case for various states of @xmath6b using the av18/il2 hamiltonian .",
    "the values shown at @xmath191 are the vmc values using @xmath163 .",
    "the gfmc very rapidly makes a large improvement on these energies ; by @xmath192  mev@xmath193 , the @xmath163 energies have been reduced by @xmath19420  mev .",
    "this rapid improvement corresponds to the removal of small admixtures of states with excitation energies @xmath195  gev from @xmath163 .",
    "typically , averages over the @xmath196  mev@xmath193 values are used as the gfmc energy .",
    "the standard deviation , computed using block averaging , of all of the individual energies for these @xmath127 values is used to compute the corresponding statistical error .",

    "in this section we present gfmc energy results in @xmath0 nuclei for the simplified av8@xmath54 @xmath41 hamiltonian , the full av18 interaction , and av18 with each of the @xmath188 interactions uix , il2 , il3 , and il4 .",

    "not all states have been calculated with all the hamiltonians .",
    "numbers in parentheses are the monte carlo statistical errors ; in addition there may be systematic errors from the gfmc algorithm of the order of 12% percent as discussed above .",
    "the energies of the particle - stable ground states calculated with just the @xmath41 interactions are underbound by 812 mev in @xmath126 and 1216 mev in @xmath128 , with the av8@xmath54 being somewhat more attractive than av18 .",
    "addition of the older uix @xmath188 interaction to av18 reduces this discrepancy significantly to 24 mev in @xmath126 and 46 mev in @xmath128 . however , addition of the il2-il4 models to av18 results in much better energies , some high and some low , but generally within 2 mev .",
    "in particular , the av18/il2 and av18/il3 hamiltonians come within @xmath198 of the experimental bindings for the ground states of @xmath5li , @xmath5be , @xmath6be , and @xmath6b , which is about as good as can be expected , given the 12% total errors in the gfmc calculation .    despite their systematic underbinding ,",
    "the older hamiltonians were able to give the correct ordering of excited states in the @xmath197 nuclei , albeit usually with insufficient splitting between states that are spin - orbit partners @xcite . in the @xmath0 nuclei",
    "this no longer holds true .",
    "the most dramatic case is the question of the proper ground state for @xmath6b : av8@xmath54 , av18 , and av18/uix all clearly and wrongly predict the @xmath199 state to be lower than the @xmath200 state , while all the av18/il2-il4 models correctly reproduce the experimental ordering .",
    "this result for the av18 interaction was first obtained by navrtil who also finds it for the cd - bonn interaction  @xcite .",
    "this incorrect ordering of states by the two - body hamiltonians also seems to be present in the case of the @xmath14 and @xmath16 excitations of @xmath5be , and may be a problem for the proper ground state of @xmath5li , although with the statistical errors of the calculation it is not so clear .",
    "the av18/uix and av18/il2-il4 models obtain these states in the proper order , with one exception , and generally with fairly good spin - orbit splittings .    as noted in sec .",
    "ii , two narrow , particle - unstable states have been observed in @xmath5li without definite spin assignments . on the basis of the close agreement between the av18/il2 energies for the lowest @xmath14 and @xmath17 states and the observed excitations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfmc_excite ] , we think these are in fact the most likely assignments for these states . also , our one calculation of the expected @xmath201 state in @xmath6be lines up with the observed state at 9.4 mev , suggesting that is its proper spin assignment .",
    "the current calculations significantly underbind @xmath187he , even when the av18/il2-il4 models are used .",
    "because both these nuclei are particle unstable , they should properly be calculated as resonant states , so the current gfmc results may be somewhat less reliable than for the other ground states .",
    "however , the experimental widths of these states are not large , and our calculations for other comparably narrow states have generally been good .",
    "it may be that some significant admixture of @xmath202 orbitals from the sd - shell should be introduced in the jastrow trial function , as suggested by recent shell - model studies  @xcite ; we have not yet attempted such a modification .",
    "in addition , as was discussed in the previous section , the constrained - path propagation may not be as reliable for these nuclei .",
    "if the present results for @xmath187he are correct , then there is a need for further tuning of the isospin dependence of the @xmath188 interactions .",
    "in addition to the total energies discussed above , we have calculated the energy differences between isobaric analog states perturbatively by evaluating the expectation values of the electromagnetic and strong csb and cd parts of the av18 hamiltonian in the wave function of the @xmath203 nucleus . the csb and cd terms can induce corresponding changes in the nuclear wave functions , leading to higher - order perturbative corrections to the splitting of isospin mass multiplets , but it is difficult for us to estimate these higher - order effects reliably in either vmc or gfmc calculations .",
    "the energies for a given isomultiplet of states can be expanded as @xmath204 where @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 are isoscalar , isovector , and isotensor terms  @xcite .",
    "the isovector coefficients @xmath208 are shown in table  [ tab : isovec ] , while the isotensor coefficients @xmath209 , are given in table  [ tab : isoten ] .",
    "the dominant contribution in each case is from the regular coulomb interaction between protons , but there are additional contributions of @xmath210 coming from the other electromagnetic and strong terms .",
    "because the av18 and av18/uix models underbind these nuclei , the density distributions tend to be more diffuse and the coulomb interaction is reduced , leaving a sizable discrepancy with experiment for the isovector coefficients .",
    "the av18/il2-il4 models give much better binding energies and consequently larger isovector coefficients which are within 5% of the experimental values .",
    "however , the isotensor coefficients come out a bit too large .",
    "point proton and neutron rms radii are shown in tables  [ tab : rms - p ] and [ tab : rms - n ] .",
    "the av18/il2-il4 hamiltonians give significantly smaller radii than the older models , presumably because of their greater binding .",
    "the experimentally measured charge radii  @xcite for the @xmath5be and @xmath6b ground states are in good agreement with the calculations from the new models .",
    "quadrupole moments are shown in table  [ tab : quad ] , as evaluated in impulse approximation .",
    "experimental values are from refs .",
    "@xcite . the contribution of two - body charge operators to the quadrupole moment",
    "are expected to be small , as in the deuteron and @xmath28li  @xcite , because both the isoscalar and isovector charge operators are relativistic corrections of order @xmath211 .",
    "expectation values of the quadrupole operator tend to have a much larger variance than radii because of the cancellations from the @xmath212 operator .",
    "given this caveat , the agreement with the measured quadrupole moments is reasonable .",
    "the impulse approximation magnetic moments are shown in table  [ tab : mag ] ; experimental values are from refs .",
    "@xcite . experience in lighter nuclei shows that there are significant two - body current contributions to the magnetic operators , particularly the isovector part . in the trinucleons ,",
    "the isoscalar portion is boosted by @xmath213 or @xmath214 , while the isovector portion is corrected by @xmath215 or @xmath216  @xcite .",
    "however , in the isoscalar @xmath28li case , the correction is a tiny + 0.003 @xmath217  @xcite . on this basis , we expect substantial improvement in the @xmath5li and @xmath5c results shown in table  [ tab : mag ] when two - body contributions to the current operator are added , while the already good @xmath6b results will not be significantly affected .",
    "however , the reasonable agreement between the ia calculations and experiment for @xmath5be may not survive .    the nucleon densities for @xmath5li and @xmath5be",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens9 ] , on both a linear ( left ) and logarithmic ( right ) scale .",
    "the densities are normalized such that the integrated value equals the appropriate total value of @xmath79 or @xmath218 .",
    "these densities are rather similar to those calculated earlier for @xmath35li and @xmath35be  @xcite with the former more peaked at the origin , and the latter showing a broad flat interior . the protons in @xmath5li cluster at the origin because two out of three are confined to the @xmath2 core , while the neutrons show a substantial skin with a hint of a p - shell peak around 1 fm .",
    "the low central densities for both protons and neutrons in @xmath5be are probably due to the large @xmath219 component in its @xmath35be core .",
    "the densities for @xmath6be and @xmath6b are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens10 ] .",
    "they have somewhat higher central values than in @xmath5be , but are also broader and flatter than @xmath5li , presumably due to the dominant @xmath35be core .",
    "we have made quantum monte carlo calculations for the ground states and low - lying excited states of @xmath0 nuclei , based on realistic two- and three - nucleon potentials .",
    "the new illinois @xmath188 models do a good job of explaining the binding energies of the ten best - known @xmath0 states of different quantum numbers , but the results for @xmath187he may indicate a deficiency in the models .",
    "if we also include the 17 narrow states to which these forces were fit in @xmath8 nuclei  @xcite , we find rms deviations from the experimental energies of 0.6 mev for av18/il2 , 0.8 mev for av18/il3 , and 1.0 mev for av18/il4 .",
    "this contrasts with rms deviations of 3.2 mev for av18/uix and 9.9 mev for av18 alone .",
    "thus av18/il2 becomes our preferred model hamiltonian with av18/il3 almost as good , although av18/il4 will be somewhat deprecated .",
    "we conclude that a fairly consistent picture of nuclear binding can be constructed for @xmath220 nuclei using a single hamiltonian and a single computational framework .",
    "this applies also to the energy differences among isobaric multiplets , which are well - reproduced .",
    "electromagnetic moments , within the limitation of the impulse approximation , are in fairly good agreement with experimental data .",
    "significant challenges for the future will be the computation of second or higher excited states of the same quantum number , and intruder states of unnatural parity ; both of these types of states first become particle - stable in the @xmath128 nuclei . we also need to evaluate electroweak transition rates in these nuclei , as has been done previously in the @xmath221 systems  @xcite .",
    "the present calculations are at the limit of our current computer resources , both in cpu time and resident memory .",
    "however , the present codes are in principle capable of computing nuclei like @xmath222be and @xmath223c ; such calculations may become feasible with the next generation of computers .",
