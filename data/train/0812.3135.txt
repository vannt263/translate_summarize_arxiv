    "theoretical arguments strongly indicate that the standard model ( sm ) picture of electroweak symmetry breaking is incomplete , and numerous extensions of the sm at the electroweak scale have been proposed .",
    "it is expected that at least some of the new particles and interactions predicted by such extended theories will be discovered and studied at the lhc .",
    "the ultimate goal of the experiments is , of course , to determine the correct theory of physics at the tev scale . this task may be quite complicated . in particular",
    ", it is quite likely that nature is described by one of the several models possessing the following features :    * physics at the tev scale is weakly coupled , and there is a light higgs ( as motivated by precision electroweak data ) ; * a number of new states are present at the tev scale , and new particles can be paired up with the known sm states , with states in the same pair carrying identical gauge charges ; * new states carry a parity quantum number distinct from their sm counterparts , implying that the lightest new particle ( lnp ) is stable ; * the lnp is weakly interacting ( as motivated by cosmological constraints on stable particles ) .",
    "the best known model of this class is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "other contenders include models with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) and little higgs models with t parity . broadly speaking",
    ", all these theories share the same lhc phenomenology : the new physics production is dominated by the colored states , which are pair - produced , and then decay down to the lnp and sm states .",
    "the interesting final states then involve jets in association with missing transverse energy and possibly leptons and photons . only by studying",
    "the detailed properties of these objects can one hope to discriminate among the models .",
    "the most convincing way to discriminate between supersymmetry and its competitors is to measure the spin of the new particles : in the little higgs and ued models the new states and their sm partners have the same spin , while in susy models their spins differ by 1/2 .",
    "measuring spin at the lhc , however , is notoriously difficult .",
    "almost all existing proposals rely on the observation that , if the produced strongly interacting state decays via a cascade chain , angular correlations between the particles emitted in subsequent steps in the cascade carry information about spin .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as a recent review  @xcite . )",
    "the availability of cascade decays with the right properties for this to work , however , depends on the spectrum and couplings of the model , and is by no means guaranteed .",
    "moreover , a large amount of data is typically needed to alleviate combinatoric and other backgrounds .",
    "if unambiguous spin measurments are unavailable , the experiments can still attempt a more modest task of model discrimination , _",
    "i.e. _ determining which of two or more specific theoretical models provides a better fit to the available data . unlike a direct spin measurement , which would rule out the entire _ class _ of models with the wrong spin assignment",
    ", this approach can only discriminate between _ specific _ models .",
    "for example , if it is found that the minimal littlest higgs with t - parity ( lht ) model can not fit the data , it does not exclude the possibility that another model of the little higgs class could provide a better fit .",
    "still , this approach can provide valuable information , and is well worth pursuing at the lhc , especially at the early stages .",
    "the goal of our study is to estimate the prospects for model discrimination with the cms detector . as a test case",
    ", we consider a very simple scenario : we assume that the _ only _ new physics process observable at the lhc is pair - production of new color - triplet particles , followed by their decay into a quark and an lnp .",
    "this process occurs at the lhc at a significant rate over large parts of the parameter space of the mssm , lht , and ued models .",
    "its detector signature is two hard jets ( plus possibly additional jets from gluon radiation and showering ) and missing transverse energy .",
    "our assumption that no other signatures are observed allows us to focus on this channel alone , and to understand in detail the issues important for model discrimination",
    ". it would be straightforward to repeat our exercise with more complicated models for the exotic particle production ( e.g. including color octet pair - production channels ) and decay ( e.g. including cascade chains involving leptons and/or weak bosons ) .",
    "the main motivation for our study comes from the work of barr  @xcite , who showed that the angular distributions of leptons from the decay of lepton partners produced directly ( via electroweak processes ) in hadron collisions carry information about the lepton partner spin .",
    "this example is particularly simple since the lepton partners are always produced in s - channel quark collisions , and their angular distribution in the production frame is almost unambiguously determined by their spin .",
    "however , its utility is somewhat limited by the small cross section of the direct lepton partner process . for quark partners , the cross sections are larger , but the production mechanism is more complicated : both quark - initiated and gluon - initiated processes",
    "need to be included , and in both cases there are both s - channel and t - channel diagrams .",
    "still , as we will show , the model - dependence of the matrix elements can be sufficiently strong to yield observable differences between the models .",
    "crucially , the differences can not be removed by simply varying the free parameters of the model with the wrong spin assignments : to demonstrate this , we performed a scan over the parameter space of the `` untrue '' model .",
    "( a recent model - discrimination study of hubisz _ et .",
    "@xcite , which studied a situation similar to our test case , also noted the significant differences in jet distributions between models with different spins , but was restricted to a single benchmark point in each model s parameter space .",

    "each model contains color - triplet massive partners for each sm quark : squarks in the mssm and t - odd quarks , or toqs , in the lht .",
    "also , each model contains a stable weakly - interacting particle : the neutralino of the mssm and the `` heavy photon '' ( the t - odd partner of the hypercharge gauge boson ) of the lht .",
    "we will assume that these are the only particles that play a role in the lhc phenomenology ; the rest of the new states in each model are too heavy to be produced .",
    "note that the two minimal models have important differences in their particle content : for example , the minimal lht does not have a color - octet heavy particle , a counterpart of the gluino ; while the mssm does not have a t - even partner of the top quark present in the lht  @xcite . in our scenario , however , neither of these particles is observed .",
    "this null result does not help with model discrimination , since we do nt know whether the particles do nt exist or are simply beyond the lhc reach .",
    "model discrimination must rely on the observed properties of the produced exotic particles or their decay products .",
    "our strategy is to simulate a large sample of events corresponding to one of the models ( we will choose the mssm ) with fixed parameters , and treat this sample as `` data '' .",
    "the question is then , how well can this data be fitted with the alternative model , in this case the lht ? it should be emphasized that the predictions of the lht model are not unique , but depend on the lht parameters .",
    "so , when fitting data , one should look for the point in the lht parameter space that provides the _",

    "all parameters are defined at the weak scale , and no unification or other high - scale inputs are assumed .",
    "the parameter choices are driven by the desire to study a point with very simple collider phenomenology : the new physics production at the lhc is completely dominated by pair - production of the first two generations of squarks .",
    "the total squark pair - production cross section is 5.0 pb . table  [ tab : susy_xsec ] lists the 22 leading squark pair - production processes , which together account for over 98% of the total .",
    "associated squark - gluino production is strongly suppressed by the high gluino mass ; the cross section ( summed over squark flavors ) is only 11 fb . associated squark - neutralino production is larger , with the total cross section of about 290 fb .",
    "however , these events have only a single hard jet , and will not pass the analysis cuts ( see section  [ sec : cuts ] ) .",
    "production of third generation squarks is also strongly suppressed , with a total cross section of only 17 fb .",
    "thus , in our analysis we will simulate the processes listed in table  [ tab : susy_xsec ] , and ignore all other susy production channels .",
    "another simplification that occurs at the chosen parameter point is in the decay pattern of the produced squarks : they decay into quarks and the lightest neutralino ( essentially a bino ) with a 100% probability .",

    "using monte carlo samples , we determined @xmath33 values for fitting a susy + bg `` data '' sample with little higgs model predictions , using the heavy toq and `` heavy photon '' masses as fit parameters and including dominant standard model backgrounds .    with 2 fb@xmath0 of signal and background events , we were able to show that a combination of ten observables encoding angular and transverse momentum distributions of the observed jets contains enough information to exclude the lht model at a 3-sigma confidence level , provided that these distributions for both models and the dominant standard model backgrounds can be reliably predicted by monte carlo simulations .",
    "we found that neither the effective cross section , which depends on potentially unknown decay branching ratios , nor information about the missing energy is crucial for this method of model discrimination .    in reality , it is likely that the lhc phenomenology is much richer than the simple scenario described here , involving , for example , competing susy production processes and complicated decay chains . in this case , the model - discrimination analysis would involve multiple channels , and more new particles ( and hence parameters ) would be required to fit .",

    "<S> we investigate the potential of the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detector at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) to discriminate between two theoretical models predicting anomalous events with jets and large missing transverse energy , minimal supersymmetry and little higgs with t parity . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a simple test case scenario , in which the only exotic particles produced at the lhc are heavy color - triplet states ( squarks or t - quarks ) , and the only open decay channel for these particles is into the stable missing - energy particle ( neutralino or heavy photon ) plus a quark . we find that in this scenario , the angular and momentum distributions of the observed jets are sufficient to discriminate between the two models with a few inverse fb of the lhc data , provided that these distributions for both models and the dominant standard model backgrounds can be reliably predicted by monte carlo simulations .    .5 cm    * model discrimination at the lhc : + .5 cm a case study * + 0.4 cm * * .2 cm    * gregory hallenbeck , maxim perelstein , christian spethmann , + julia thom , and jennifer vaughan * +    _ newman laboratory of elementary particle physics + cornell university , ithaca , ny 14853 , usa _   +    glh59@cornell.edu , maxim@lepp.cornell.edu , cs366@cornell.edu , jt297@cornell.edu , jjv27@cornell.edu    0.3truecm </S>"
