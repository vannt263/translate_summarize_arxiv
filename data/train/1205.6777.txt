    "the mean - field concept is one the fundamental paradigm in all theoretical physics and its interdisciplinary branches and applications .",
    "the mean - field idea consists in replacing the interactions acting on a particle with an effective external field to be determined self - consistently .",
    "this paradigm allows one , not only to analytically face , in a first approximation , any given model , but it also provides a powerful understanding of the physics of the model which , even though approximate , is often pedagogically deeper than the understanding one would get from a possible exact solution ( if any ) . in particular , it would be harder to understand the concept of the collective behavior and the phase transitions of a system without a suitable mean - field theory .    at the mathematical base of the mean - field theory",
    "there are models which are exactly solvable by a mean - field technique : the mean - field models .",
    "these models represent the limit cases of more realistic models in which one or more parameters are typically send to 0 or to @xmath5 so that the mean - field approximation becomes exact .",
    "traditionally , the concept of the mean - field models is associated with the absence of correlations in the thermodynamic limit . in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) we have shown that this condition is only a sufficient condition for the system to be mean - field , but in general it is not necessary .",
    "there are in fact infinite models having non zero correlations but still they are mean - field .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 is an arbitrary hamiltonian , the model @xmath7 , with @xmath8 a generic fully connected interaction , is mean - field , in the sense that we can exactly replace the interactions acting on a particle with an effective external field to be determined self - consistently .",
    "however , now , the presence of the term @xmath6 gives rise to non zero correlations whenever @xmath6 has short - range interactions .",
    "of course , unlike the traditional mean - field models ( where @xmath9 and there are not short - range correlations ) , the arbitrariness of @xmath6 lets it open now a very richer scenario of phase transitions .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that , when @xmath6 has negative interactions , inversion transition phenomena and first - order phase transitions may set in @xcite .",
    "more in general , the phase transition scenario associated to the term @xmath8 or to @xmath10 can change drastically when @xmath6 has negative couplings .    in recent years",
    ", a renewed attention towards models having both short- and long - range interactions , has been drawn due to the the importance of small - world networks @xcite , where a finite - dimensional and an infinite - dimensional character are both present in the network structure .",
    "as expected , such models turn out to be mean - field , at least for what concerns their critical behavior .",
    "however , rather than a theorem , except for the ising case near the critical point @xcite , and a few examples in one dimension @xcite , this turns out to be an empirical fact .",
    "an exact analytically treatment , even not rigorous and confined to relatively simple models , is still quite far from being reached out when short - range correlations are present , as happens in a generic small - world network . on the other hand , the models introduced in @xcite can be seen as ideal small - world networks in which the random connectivity of the graph goes to the system size @xmath11 and the coupling @xmath1 associated to the long - range interactions is replaced by @xmath12 . clearly , without a serious understanding of the more basic models presented in @xcite , the analytical study of the small - world networks and its generalizations ( including the scale - free case @xcite , which for the ising case has been analyzed in @xcite ) , will remain impossible .    in this spirit , in the present paper we analyze a simple and yet rich model : a mean - field potts model @xcite in which @xmath6 is a one - dimensional three - state potts model and @xmath8 is the traditional three - state mean - field term , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ordinary fully - connected interaction . the mean - field equations in this case are sufficiently simple to be exactly and explicitly solved via the transfer matrix method and the cardano formula for cubic equations .",
    "as expected , the presence of a non zero positive coupling , @xmath13 , in @xmath6 , alters only smoothly the phase diagram of the system ( but not its correlations which unlike the traditional mean - field term will be now non zero ) , characterized by a first - order phase transition .",
    "however , when @xmath6 has a negative coupling , @xmath14 , besides the first - order transition there emerges a new transition which , quite surprisingly , is continuous .",
    "this transition is not stable ( the corresponding free energy being not a local minimum but a saddle point ) , so that it does not have a physical ground , however it remains a non trivial solution of the mean - field equations with a corresponding ground state energy ( the solution exists at all temperatures ) .",
    "finally , we analyze the situation in which the term @xmath8 has a negative coupling @xmath15 . in this case the mean - field equations have only the trivial paramagnetic solution and there is no phase transition .",
    "however , the mean - field equations lead to a dynamics which turns out to be stable with an attractor of period 2 .",
    "quite interestingly , this dynamics gives rise only to a second - order phase transition with classical critical exponent 1/2 , like in the ising model .",
    "in the spirit of @xcite , we introduce now a model built by using both finite - dimensional and infinite dimensional hamiltonian terms . a generic mean - field potts model , _",
    "i.e. _ , a model where each variable @xmath16 can take @xmath17 values , @xmath18 , can be defined through the following hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the kronecker delta function and @xmath6 is a generic @xmath17-states potts hamiltonian with no external field .",

    "( [ z1potts ] ) we find that , if @xmath29 is the order parameter for @xmath6 as a function of a @xmath17-component external field   ( the pure model ) , does not depend on the vertex position .",
    "] , @xmath30 , then , in the thermodynamic limit , the order parameter for @xmath10 , @xmath31 , satisfies the system @xmath32 and the free energy @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 finally , from eqs .",
    "( [ potts ] ) and ( [ pottsf ] ) written for an arbitrary external field , it is easy to check that for the connected correlation function @xmath35 it holds @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the connected correlation functions for @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit , and the last term in the rhs is a finite size effect that can also be calculated @xcite .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity in this paper we will not calculate the correlation functions .",
    "before facing the analysis of our model , we want to briefly recall the traditional mean - field potts model defined as in eq .",

    "( [ potts])-([pottsf ] ) in this case may seem not necessary but it is instructive . to apply eqs .",
    "( [ potts])-([pottsf ] ) to the present case , we need to solve the corresponding pure model , which is a null potts model in the presence of a uniform external field , @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we have to calculate the following trivial partition function , @xmath39 , which differs from @xmath40 for the absence of the fully - connected ( long - range ) interaction : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "we have @xmath43 @xmath44      by plugging eqs .",
    "( [ potts0])-([pottsf0 ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ potts])-([pottsf ] ) we get immediately the following system of equations and the free energy density : @xmath45 @xmath46 eqs .",
    "( [ potts0t])-([pottsf0 t ] ) give rise to a well known phase transition scenario @xcite : a second - order mean - field ising phase transition sets up only for @xmath47 , while for any @xmath48 there is a first - order phase transition at the critical value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : @xmath49     and @xmath50 ( equivalent to the traditional mean - field potts model ) . ]",
    "we now specialize the above general result to the case in which @xmath6 represents a one - dimensional three - state potts hamiltonian : @xmath51 where we have assumed periodic boundary conditions @xmath52 , and from now on it is understood that each potts variable @xmath16 can take the values 1 , 2 , and 3 .      to apply eqs .",

    "once the eigenvalues have been calculated , the magnetizations , @xmath76 , of the pure model in the thermodynamic limit can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) as @xmath77 from eqs .",
    "( [ a0])-([r ] ) we see that , in order to evaluate eq . ( [ x0 ] ) , we need to take into account the following derivatives , with @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86      by performing the effective substitutions @xmath87 in eqs .",

    "( [ potts])-([pottsf ] ) , the role that a generic external field had on the pure model @xmath6 , has been now replaced by the effective magnetizations @xmath91 to be found self - consistently by eqs .",

    "we could easily consider the presence of an additional external field @xmath38 by simply performing the effective substitutions @xmath92 in eqs .",

    "we find it convenient to distinguish the cases @xmath94 and @xmath14 both for @xmath2 . later on",
    "we will consider also the case @xmath15 .",
    "as is known , the potts model , like any other short - range model , in one dimension does not own a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however , from eqs .",
    "( [ x ] ) and ( [ f ] ) we see that , for any positive value of @xmath1 , the model governed by @xmath10 turns out to be a mean - field model so that a phase transition is always expected",

    "note however that eqs .",
    "( [ l0])-([dr ] ) are singular for @xmath3 . therefore , to analyze the case @xmath3 we can simply choose a very small value of @xmath0 .",

    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the phase transition is triggered by a broken symmetry mechanism according to which one of the three components @xmath102 becomes favored in spite of the other two that remain equal to each other so that , for @xmath103 , two components go to 0 and the favored one reaches the value 1 .",

    "we note however that , for @xmath106 , @xmath104 reaches an asymptotic value not far from @xmath107 .",
    "this scenario can be partially physically explained by the observation that , from one hand , for any @xmath2 the model is effectively mean - field , so that @xmath108 but , on the other hand , when @xmath106 , the model remains partially dominated by the one - dimensional geometry , and in one dimension ( _ i.e. _ , in the pure model ) there is no phase transition .",

    "the difference is due to the fact that , in the ising case , the possible transition is second - order and regulated by an equation involving @xmath111 , the susceptibility of the pure model , which has always the property @xmath112 for @xmath109 @xcite , while such an equation does not apply for a first - order phase transition , whose @xmath97 is not regulated by @xmath111 .     and @xmath13 . ]",

    "when @xmath14 the model is still mean field , so that a first - order phase transition similar to the case @xmath13 is still present , but with a corresponding lower value for @xmath104 .",
    "now , however , due to the fact that @xmath14 , we must to take into account that two spins that are consecutive along the 1d chain , at low enough temperatures , can not have the same value , so that , among the three components @xmath102 , the favored one(s ) , if any , along the 1d chain must be alternated with another one ( others ) . there are two ways to realize this alternation . if for example we look for situations in which , at low enough temperatures , the component @xmath113 is favored , along the 1d chain we can look for configurations of the kind @xmath114 .",
    "but we can also look for situations in which , for example , both the components @xmath113 and @xmath115 are favored and , at low enough temperatures , the configurations are of the kind @xmath116 . again , even if in one dimension ( _ i.e. _ , in the pure model ) there is no phase transition , the presence of a finite positive @xmath1 guarantees the existence of such phase transitions , as confirmed by figs .",

    "however , only the state coming from the first - order transition is stable , while the other turns out to be unstable , as seen from the fact that the initial conditions giving rise to the second - order phase transition live in a subspace of @xmath117 of the kind @xmath120 which has zero volume in 3 dimensions .",
    "a basin of attraction of zero volume corresponds to a unstable state .",

    "however , the presence a second - order phase transition in a non disordered three - state mean - field potts model , even if hidden in a subspace , is a quite non obvious and interesting fact : in the subspace @xmath120 , as the temperature is decreased , the system is forced to favorite @xmath121 not by a jump , but continuously .    , while the unstable s state is obtained only with the initial condition @xmath122 . finally the leading state is obtained with any initial conditions of the kind @xmath123 . ]    . ]",
    "when @xmath15 , the approach we have used via eq .",
