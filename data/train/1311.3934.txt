    "the objective of this paper is to characterize the measurement stability of stare and spatial scan mode observations that have been used to study exoplanets with wfc3 . because the spatial scan mode moves the spectrum over a large range of detector pixels , which potentially have different properties , it is important to test the measurement stability as a function of location on the array .",
    "exoplanet spectroscopy via the transit method typically relies on taking the difference of two large numbers to measure a small number .",
    "this approach makes knowledge of measurement systematic errors critically important . for characterizing an exoplanet s terminator transmission spectrum ( using the primary eclipse event ) or dayside emission spectrum ( using the secondary eclipse event )",
    ", the typical spectroscopic measurement dynamic range varies from between @xmath31000:1 ( 1000 ppm ) in the mid - infrared to @xmath320,000:1 ( 50 ppm ) in the visible and near - infrared .",
    "continuing to improve the measurement dynamic range is a priority . because higher precision enables new science such as the detection of new opacity sources , improved abundance constraints , ingress / egress light curve mapping , measurement of atmospheric temporal variability , and characterization of smaller targets , pushing for higher precision is critically important to the field .",
    "most of the instruments used for transit spectroscopy today were not specifically designed for the task ; this makes characterization of these instruments an especially important activity .    due to a combination of space - based location , good wavelength coverage , moderate spectral resolution , and excellent telescope pointing ,",
    "the best instrument available today for transit spectroscopy is arguably wfc3 using the ir grism .",
    "the instrument has already been used extensively for exoplanet spectroscopy ( berta et al .",

    "2013 ) , and the field of exoplanet atmospheric characterization is beginning to rely on this critical community resource with programs conducted using both stare and spatial scan observational modes . although a detailed comparison of these modes did not previously exist , the instrument status report ( isr ) describing the spatial scan mode does note photometric ` flicker ' ( mccullough & mackenty 2012 ) at the 3% level in spatial scan mode testing which raises questions about how the mode will perform for spectrophotometry measurements .",
    "motivated by the growing importance of this instrument , we undertook a detailed analysis in which we determined the measurement stability for differential spectroscopy , the approach often used to characterize the atmospheres of transiting planets .",
    "wfc3 is an exceptional instrument that has produced extraordinary measurements .",
    "our findings , reported below , should be viewed in the context of the astronomer s desire to operate an instrument well beyond the original engineering design space .",
    "our approach to characterizing the instrument is simple .",
    "absent an absolute calibration reference , the only way to assess instrument stability is to make the same measurement many times and quantify the repeatability .",
    "to quantify the stability of the wfc3 spectrophotometric time series observations , we measure differences between portions of the time series and determine how the observed noise compares to the theoretically expected noise . ideally , we would quantify the stability using measurements of calibration targets with carefully selected properties .",
    "this could potentially require tens of hubble orbits , and no such calibration program has been carried out for wfc3 ir grism spectroscopy .",
    "an alternative approach is to base the analysis on a science data set , preferably one where the same object has been repeatedly observed in the same mode .",
    "fortunately , such a target exists ; the gj 1214 exoplanet host star has been observed extensively with the wfc3 ir grism using both stare and spatial scan mode observations , and we use these data for our study .",
    "for all of the observations we analyzed , the gj 1214 system was observed with 4 consecutive hst orbits timed to place 2 orbits before the primary eclipse event and one orbit after the primary eclipse event . in our analysis , the first orbit is excluded to allow for spacecraft settling and detector effects that could uniquely affect the first orbit .",
    "we analyze the difference between the pre- and post - eclipse time series in which no exoplanet - related event impacts the measurement .",
    "the differential measurement stability is characterized using the mean and the variance .",
    "all infrared observations with wfc3 are conducted in multiaccum mode which starts with two array resets , followed quickly by an initial readout , and then a user selectable number of nondestructive reads , specified by the multiaccum mode and the nsamp parameter ( see wfc3 handbook ) . the non - destructive reads ( nsamp=1 to nsamp = n ) sample up the ramp as the detector accumulates electrons . the initial readout after a detector reset , termed the  zero read ",
    "( nsamp=0 ) , measures the reset pedestal . the light measured during a single integration is the total number of photoelectrons measured during the sample up the ramp . for wfc3 , all detector reads , including the zero read , are saved and available for download from the mast archive .",
    "gj 1214b data was executed using both stare and scan observing modes ( see figure 1 and table 1 ) and in all cases , the detector was operated with the same integration and number of nondestructive reads ( nsamp value ) for each of the four - orbit sequences . in stare mode ,",
    "the spectrum is held at the same location and stabilized at the subpixel level on the detector by the hst pointing system .",
    "the stare mode has frequently been used for exoplanet spectroscopy because it minimizes sensitivity to inter and intra - pixel non - uniformity .",
    "recently , the spatial scan mode has been developed for wfc3 ( mccullough & mackenty 2012 ) to improve instrument duty cycle and bright target capability . in this mode",
    ", the spectrum is scanned across the detector in the spatial direction during an integration ; this process is then repeated in the same detector location for subsequent integrations .",
    "we measure instrument stability by constructing a quantity that should be zero and tracking the behavior of this quantity .",
    "our merit figure for instrument stability is the difference of the measured spectrum before eclipse and after eclipse .",
    "subject to the assumption that the star is constant , this difference should be zero ; departures from zero represent changes in the instrument spectral transfer function .",
    "any deviations from zero , whatever the origin , represent aspects of the measurement that must be accounted for when estimating the measurement precision . to maintain sensitivity to array location - dependent effects",
    ", we extract the electrons measured during each sample up the ramp read .",
    "we do this by using the @xmath4_raw.fits data - type files , which are the most minimally processed files available for wfc3 .",
    "we begin the analysis by constructing a set of difference images , @xmath5 , which isolate the photoelectrons detected during a single sample up the ramp read by taking the difference of consecutive nondestructive reads , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a single detector read image , and has time - related indices corresponding to orbit , @xmath8 , integration , @xmath9 , and sample up the ramp read , @xmath10 .",
    "this subtraction also removes array artifacts and the background associated with previous reads .",
    "the @xmath11 images contain the spectrum + background measured during a specific nondestructive read .",
    "for each @xmath11 image ( see figure 1 ) , we determine the spectrum and background location , subtract the background , and collapse the spectrum along the spatial axis .",
    "the result is a spectrum , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 can be decomposed with indices representing orbit , @xmath8 , integration number , @xmath9 , and sample up the ramp read number , @xmath10 . to measure the achieved stability , we take the coupled difference @xmath14 of spectra measured in the pre and post eclipse hubble orbit : @xmath15 i.e. the first read of the first exposure of the pre - eclipse orbit",
    "is subtracted from the first read of the first exposure of the post eclipse orbit , etc .",
    "( see figure 2 ) .",
    "taking the coupled difference has the effect of removing the repeatable effects within an orbit , like a ramp buildup .",
    "we then construct an average quantity that removes the dependence on integration , index @xmath9 , @xmath16 the quantity @xmath17 measures the normalized difference between spectra in orbits on either side of eclipse and is a merit figure for spectral measurement stability .",
    "ideally , it should be zero ; departures from zero indicate that the instrument spectral transfer function has changed .",
    "for each of the @xmath18 , we determine the variance @xmath19_{j},\\ ] ] where var is the variance taken over the set of @xmath9 integrations .",
    "we also calculate the average of the @xmath17 , which removes the dependence on the integration index , @xmath10 , @xmath20 where the variance of @xmath21 is given by , @xmath22_{i},\\ ] ] and where var is the variance taken over the set of @xmath10 sample - up - the - ramp reads .",
    "we also calculate the photon noise for the observations as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of photons , and add additional noise for the measurement noise due to the read process and the background . by comparing the photon noise ( i.e. ,  the theoretical limit ) to the measured noise , we determine the excess noise in the system .    for the spatial scan observations we analyzed ,",
    "the reads are evenly spaced in time after read 1 .",
    "thus for the spatial - scan observations with nsamp=14 or 16 , there are 14 or 16 nondestructive reads ( including the zero read ) , and in our analysis we use the difference between reads @xmath10 and @xmath25 from read 2 through 13 or 15 , which corresponds to a set of 12 or 14 independent measurements , [ @xmath26 ...",

    "we show that the spatial scan observations exhibit non - gaussian behavior and suffer from significant excess measurement noise that is traceable to changes in instrument behavior for different regions of the focal plane .",
    "this spatial - temporal variability creates excess noise at the level of @xmath57 the photon noise that is relatively invariant for changes in spectral resolution .",
    "the spatial - temporal variations correspond to a measurement error contribution of up to @xmath375 ppm per pixel per hour .",
    "if other hawaii - type detectors have similar behavior , multiobject calibration approaches may be limited to @xmath31000 ppm measurement precision .",
    "for jwst , which will use the long wavelength h2rg detectors , careful investigation of the spatial - scan noise and development of calibration methods is likely crucial to achieve the full scientific potential of the observatory for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "only twice , this and one previous time , have large numbers of wfc3 orbits ( @xmath53 ) been systematically analyzed for measurement properties at the level of individual sample - up - the - ramp detector reads . in both cases ,",
    "evidence of systematics appeared that ( 1 ) could not be revealed by the analysis of data averaged to the detector integration time , ( 2 ) showed some instrument modes were better than others , and ( 3 ) found that measurement performance in some instrument modes is variable at the visit - to - visit time scale .",
    "the approach of working with a time series of individual detector sample - up - the - ramp reads allows for the detection of systematic changes in eclipse depth or a stability measurement metric that are correlated with detector read .",
    "it also provides a natural mechanism to handle saturated observations , which occurs for a surprising number of the wfc3 exoplanet observations .",
