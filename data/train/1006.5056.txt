    "nonlinear evolution equations are widely used as models to describe complex physical phenomena . because most classical processes observed in the physical world are nonconservative",

    "hamilton s equations are derived from the lagrangian and are equivalent to the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "if a lagrangian is constructed using noninteger - order derivatives , then the resulting equation of motion can be nonconservative .",
    "it was shown that such fractional derivatives in the lagrangian describe nonconservative forces [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "further study of the fractional euler - lagrange can be found in the work of agrawal [ 3 , 4 ] , baleanu and coworkers [ 5 , 6 ] and tarasov and zaslavsky [ 7 , 8 ] . during the last decades , fractional calculus has been applied to almost every field of science , engineering and mathematics .",

    "the propagation of solitary waves is important as it describes characteristic nature of the interaction of the waves and the plasmas . in the case where the velocity of particles is much smaller than that of light",
    ", ion - acoustic waves present the non - relativistic behaviors , but in the case where the velocity of particles approaches that of light , the relativistic effect becomes dominant [ 10 ] .",

    "nevertheless , relativistic ion - acoustic waves have not been well investigated .",
    "when we assume that the ion energy depends only on the kinetic energy , such plasma ions have to attain very high velocity of relativistic order .",
    "thus , by considering the weakly relativistic effect where the ion velocity is about @xmath4of the velocity of light , we can describe the relativistic motion of such ions in the study of nonlinear interaction of the waves and the plasmas [ 11 ] .",
    "it appears that the weakly relativistic and ion temperature effects play an important role to energetic ion - acoustic waves propagating in interplanetary space [ 12 ] .",
    "washimi and taniti [ 13 ] were the first to use reductive perturbation method to study the propagation of a slow modulation of a quasimonochromatic waves through plasma .",

    "we expect that the inclusion of time fractional parameter and a weakly relativistic effect will change the properties as well as the regime of existence of solitons .",
    "several methods have been used to solve fractional differential equations such as : the laplace transform method , the fourier transform method , the iteration method and the operational method [ 16 ] .",
    "recently , there are some papers deal with the existence and multiplicity of solution of nonlinear fractional differential equation by the use of techniques of nonlinear analysis [ 17 - 18 ] . in this paper",
