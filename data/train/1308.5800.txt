    "the motion of a fracture front through a disordered medium is for obvious reasons of great practical importance .",
    "nevertheless , it is a very complex problem which have kept materials scientists and mechanical engineers occupied for almost two centuries @xcite . in an attempt to simplify the problem , schmittbuhl et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to study the motion of a fracture front moving along a weak plane , thereby supressing the out of plane motion of the front . in a seminal experimental study , schmittbuhl and",
    "mly @xcite followed this idea up by sintering two sandblasted plexiglass plates together and then plying them apart from one edge .",
    "the sintering made the otherwise due to the sandblasting , opaque plates transparent . where the plates were broken apart again , the opaqueness returned .",
    "hence , it was possible to identify and follow the motion of the front since the plates would be transparent in front of the crack front and opaque behind it .",
    "there have been a large number of studies on this system following this initial work .",
    "most of these studies have been theoretical or numerical in character and they have mostly dealt with the roughness of the crack front , see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "see also the recent reviews by bonamy and bonamy and bouchaud @xcite .",
    "the roughness is only one aspect of the motion of the crack front in this system .",
    "a first study of the dynamics of the front was published by mly and schmittbuhl in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution was measured and found to decay slower than an exponential .",
    "this was followed by a study by mly et al .",
    "@xcite introducing the waiting time matrix technique making it possible to measure pixel by pixel the time the front sits still locally .",
    "this revealed an avalanche structure where portions of the front would sweep an area @xmath0 with a velocity @xmath1 before halting again .",
    "both the distribution of areas and velocities were power laws .",
    "in two later papers , tallakstad et al.@xcite and lenglin et al .",
    "@xcite , have continued and refined this work .    the fluctuating line model , based on the idea that the crack front moves as a pinned elastic line @xcite , dominates the theoretical descriptions of the constrained crack problem .",
    "it is a top - down approach where the motion of the crack front is derived from continuum elastic theory .",
    "its earliest use was to calculate the roughness exponent controlling the scaling properties of the crack front .",
    "if @xmath2 is the position of the crack front at time @xmath3 and position @xmath4 along its base line , then one finds the height - height correlation function @xmath5 scaling as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the rougness exponent @xcite .",
    "the most presise measurement of the roughness exponent withing the fluctuating line model to date is @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "hence , there is a large scale roughness regime which is consistent with the fluctuating line model .",
    "however , the small scale regime is too rough .",
    "laurson et al .",
    "@xcite has linked this regime to correlations in the pinning strength below the larkin lenght within the fluctuating line model .",
    "this approach assumes that the physics behind both scaling regimes is describable within the same top - down model .    a very different approach to explain the roughness of the crack front has been proposed by schmittbuhl et al .  @xcite .",

    "this idea in turn has its origin in the proposal by bouchaud et al .",

    "we have added such slopes , and indeed this seems fulfilled .",
    "we may then speculate whether the exponents that we measure for the softer system ( @xmath82 ) , indeed are roughness exponents  at least for some groups of @xmath125 values .",
    "another way to examine these scaling relations is to check the relation between @xmath160 and @xmath0 .",
    "we expect to see a power law relationship of type @xmath161 the data are plotted in fig",

    "these results are to be compared to the experimental measurements @xcite giving @xmath170 in pinning and the depinning regime and @xmath171 or @xmath172 in the depinning regime depending on how the bounding box was defined .",

    "in our model , @xmath39 and @xmath45 are the most important input parameters .",
    "@xmath45 effectively controls the loading conditions . a high value for @xmath45 amounts to a large angle of contact between the materials , or slow loading conditions , and vice versa . as long as @xmath175 is in a range where it allows the front to develop but not extend out of the system , we see no change in any scaling exponents we have investigated .",
    "this behavior is supported by the experimental results where no dependence on the loading conditions was found and the average propagation velocity of the front spanned more than four and a half orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 controls the material behavior . a small value for @xmath39 can amount to model a system of low modulus of elasticity or a long length scale , and vice versa . based on",
    "the behavior alluded to in our model , we may propose the following scenario . for low values of @xmath39 ,",
    "the fracture process is due to stress concentration leading to damage forming on the fracture front .",
    "this regime is classified by a roughness exponent of @xmath176 and an underlying burst process of same exponent @xmath177 .",
    "as @xmath39 increases , the burst process changes behavior to @xmath178 , while the front is still characterized by @xmath179 . as @xmath39 is increased further , the effect of the burst exponent begins to show on the scale of the front and damage begins to form ahead of the front . at this point ,",
    "the roughness exponent changes from 0.39 and grows into 0.67 . at higher @xmath39 , both the burst process and the roughness of the front",
    "is now characterized by the larger exponent @xmath178 .",
    "we have developed a minimal model which we have previously shown to contain two different fracture growth processes which reproduce results from experiments with fracture fronts of roughness @xmath180 on small length scales and @xmath176 on larger length scales @xcite . in this paper we have shown that this quasistatic model also produces data consistent with the experimental analysis of the dynamics of the fracture front .",
    "most notably we recover the existence and behavior of a depinning and a pinning regime . in the pinning regime",
    "we recover the same 0.39-scaling exponent of the front in the bursts . in the depinning regime",
    "we can see traces of this behavior , but more importantly , we recover the 0.67-scaling exponent of the front seen on shorter length scales . from this , we conjecture that the collective behavior of the underlying bond breaking process is first and most visible in the damage bursts .",
    "the global front roughness changes according to the change in burst process when one process suppresses the other , i.e. , on a different scale .",
