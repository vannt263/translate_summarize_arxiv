    "by converting heat into voltage , thermoelectric materials are not only of major interest in both energy saving and cooling applications but they also bring a fundamental challenge in order to find the physical limits optimizing their performance .",
    "as stated by mahan and sofo , @xcite this problem can be formulated as follows : _ what is the best electronic structure a thermoelectric can have ? _ in their answer they stress that the energy distribution of the charge carriers should be as narrow as possible , @xcite thus emphasizing the relevance of correlated materials to thermoelectricity as those in the vicinity of a mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite in particular , layered cobaltates seem to belong to this class of materials:@xcite they exhibit interesting properties , @xcite including superconductivity@xcite and both metalliclike resistivity and large thermopower at room temperature .",
    "in particular , it has been recently pointed out that their large thermopower could both result from extended quasiparticles with an enhanced effective mass , and from an entropy contribution of localized spins .",
    "@xcite indeed the room temperature thermopower is large in the whole series of cobalt misfits and does not depend on the nature of the separating layers .",

    "a lack of systematic trend has been shown for both resistivity and thermopower of these systems at low temperature .",
    "@xcite the low temperature thermopower exhibits a strong magnetic field dependence in bicacoo and in na@xmath10coo@xmath5 , @xcite but not in bibacoo .",
    "@xcite while for most cobaltates , there is a large temperature range where the thermopower is t - linear , this behavior does not extrapolate to zero at zero temperature in bicacoo , in contrast to , _",
    "e.g. _ , bibacoo .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it is known that the entropic contribution@xcite or the electronic correlations@xcite can increase thermopower , these two additive contributions further raise the aforementioned issue : what is the nature of the electronic states relevant to the transport ?",
    "ca@xmath1o@xmath2@xmath3coo@xmath1 . ]    to that aim we report in this paper on a crossed experimental investigation of the magnetoresistance and thermopower in single crystal cobalt oxide [ bi@xmath0ca@xmath1o@xmath2@xmath3coo@xmath1 , here used as a probe aimed at characterizing the coupling between itinerant and localized states .",
    "while a large negative magnetoresistance was already measured in sintered samples , @xcite we demonstrate here that it follows a scaling behavior with both magnetic field and temperature . originally introduced in the context of the colossal magnetoresistance of the manganites ,",
    "@xcite this scaling implies a spin dependent transport mechanism .",
    "thus , we show that the analysis of the negative magnetoresistance allows to shed new light on the electronic states leading to high thermopower .",
    "similarly to na@xmath11coo@xmath5 , the structure of the incommensurate cobalt oxide [ bi@xmath0ca@xmath1o@xmath2@xmath3coo@xmath1 ( abbreviated thereafter bicacoo ) contains single [ coo@xmath5 ] layer of cdi@xmath5 type stacked with rocksalt - type layers instead of a sodium deficient layer as displayed in fig .",

    "in order to investigate the transport properties and more specifically the magnetoresistance in bicacoo , we have measured the single crystal in - plane resistivity @xmath14(h , t ) using a standard four terminal method .",
    "the studied single crystals were grown using a standard flux method , @xcite with typical sizes of the order of 4@xmath152@xmath150.02 mm@xmath16 . as displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , the temperature dependence of the resistivity exhibits a transport crossover around 200 k from a high temperature metalliclike behavior to a low temperature insulatinglike one . while in the former regime the values of the resistivity remain rather low , fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] displays a large enhancement of @xmath14 at low temperature indicating thus an efficient localization process .",
    "we also observe that the latter behavior is strongly reduced by the application of an in - plane magnetic field suggesting an unconventionnal insulatinglike regime .     at 0 t and 9 t , the magnetic field being parallel to the conducting plane .",
    "the inset displays a transport crossover from a high temperature metalliclike behavior to a low temperature insulatinglike one . ]      in order to gain a better insight into this state , we have performed transport measurements as a function of an in - plane magnetic field h at constant temperature t. the data reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] spans the t - range from 60 k down to 3 k with a large negative magnetoresistance reaching at the lowest temperature 85 @xmath17 at 9 t. also , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] demonstrates that the whole set of magnetoresistance data can be scaled onto a variable range hopping form ( abbreviated thereafter vrh ) which can be written as it follows .",
    "@xmath18    while the two exponents @xmath19=1/2 and 1/3 lead to satisfactory scalings , it is worth noting that the value @xmath19=1/2 provides the best collapse of the experimental points onto a single curve .",
    "originally introduced by mott to describe the electronic conduction in disordered materials , the vrh theory essentially leads to the exponents @xmath19=1/4 or 1/3 in three or two dimensions , and @xmath19=1/2 in disordered systems with electron correlations .",

    "the inset displays the magnetic field dependence of the normalized resistivity over the whole temperature range .",
    "the applied magnetic field is parallel to the conducting plane . ]",
    "more recently , the vrh mechanism has been extended to the case of magnetic disorder to explain the colossal negative magnetoresistance measured in manganites@xcite and also applied in the chromium based spinel compounds .",
    "@xcite the main ideas which underlie this conducting process consist in a variable range spin dependent hopping ( vrsdh ) due to the hund s coupling -j@xmath21*s*.*@xmath22 * between the quasiparticles spin * s * and the localized spin * @xmath22 * , with the hund s coupling constant j@xmath21 . to basically illustrate this mechanism ,",

    "first , the magnetic potential barriers are randomly distributed in such a paramagnetic material , namely there is a magnetic disorder which implies a vrh conduction .",
    "besides , an applied magnetic field tends to align the localized spins and thus lowers both @xmath28 and the disorder , suggesting a negative magnetoresistance .",
    "in order to give a deeper insight into the spin dependent hopping that is more extensively developed in ref .",
    ", an analogy can be performed with the conventional vrh process . in the latter case ,",
    "the resistivity varies as @xmath31exp(t@xmath32/t)@xmath33 with t@xmath341/(@xmath35 g(e@xmath36 ) ) , @xmath37 being the localization length and g(e@xmath36 ) the density of states at the fermi level ( dos ) .",

    "also , this constant dos implies an average magnetic potentiel barrier @xmath40 .",
    "the latter mean value is no longer valid when a magnetic field is applied because @xmath410 , and it must be written as @xmath42 . in this case , the misorientation can be expressed from the local magnetizations @xmath43 at the two sites i and j as @xmath44=m@xmath45 @xmath46cos @xmath47 , with the saturation magnetization m@xmath48 . since there are no short range correlations in a paramagnet , the averaged magnetization is supposed to scale as the brillouin function b@xmath49(x ) as discussed by wagner et al.@xcite it is given by : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the angular momentum , @xmath52 , the land factor g=2 , k@xmath53 the boltzmann constant and @xmath54 the bohr magneton .    as a consequence ,",
    "one deduces that @xmath55=b@xmath49(x)@xmath56 and thus the averaged magnetic potentiel barrier is @xmath57=@xmath29 ( 1-b@xmath49(x)@xmath56)/2 . since it is lowered from its value without magnetic field by the factor ( 1-b@xmath49(x)@xmath56 ) , one may infer that the new dos is enhanced as n(@xmath28)@xmath391/(@xmath29(1-b@xmath49(x)@xmath56 ) by assuming that it keeps constant over the whole range of potential . in this approximation , the temperature @xmath58(x ) can be written following eq .",

    "the three tested sets of parameters with j=1/2 ( t@xmath61=24 k ) , j=1 ( t@xmath61=12 k ) and j=3/2 ( t@xmath61=6 k ) demonstrate unambiguously the agreement with j=1/2 by also confirming the relevance of the analysis .",
    "one can here emphasize that the found rather low value of t@xmath61 is consistent with a vrh transport since it suggests as required a localization length exceeding the interatomic distances . beyond these strong checks",
    ", this result implies that the localized spin involved here in the vrsdh mechanism in bicacoo is @xmath22=1/2 as previously inferred from the analysis of the magnetic field dependence of the thermopower@xcite and in agreement with the previously reported susceptibility measurements .",

    "[ fig2 ] in bicacoo . by analogy with the crystallographic structure of na@xmath10coo@xmath5 , @xcite the [ coo@xmath5 ] planes in the misfit cobaltates",
    "are assumed to be conducting and are stacked with the insulating rocksalt - type layers .",
    "these [ coo@xmath5 ] layers consist in a 2d triangular lattice co sheets octahedrally coordinated with o above and below the co plane . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the co d levels are first crystal field split in the octahedral o environment into a lower lying t@xmath67 and a upper lying e@xmath68 manifold . in this context , the six electrons of the co@xmath65 ( d@xmath62 ) occupy the t@xmath67 levels ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "second , the difference in energy between the d@xmath63 and d@xmath64 levels can be reduced assuming a structural distortion of the octahedron following from a stretching of the the z axis . therefore ,",
    "for sufficiently strong hund s coupling , the gap between the d@xmath63 and the d@xmath64 levels can become smaller than the hund s rule splitting , _",
    "i.  e. _ the spin up d@xmath63 energy can get smaller than the spin down d@xmath64 energy . as a result",

    "[ fig3](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , leads to the same electronic background as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and explains the above - mentioned negative magnetoresistance .",
    "even if this situation can be achieved from others scenarios , possibly involving others orbitals instead of the d@xmath63 and the d@xmath64 ones , we emphasize that the aforementioned ingredients must remain to explain the magnetoresistance , namely a distorsion and a hund s splitting which reduce the t@xmath67-e@xmath69 gap and spin polarize the electronic levels . also , it is worth noting that a similar description with a strong coupling between the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom has been quite recently proposed in order to explain the magnetic properties in the parent compound na@xmath10coo@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite      we now would like to address more specifically the connection between the electronic levels represented in fig .",

    "it is worth noting that the latter is plotted from the two limiting cases , namely with @xmath72/6 k@xmath53/e t / t@xmath73 if t@xmath74t@xmath73 and @xmath71= k@xmath53/e ln(@xmath75/(1-@xmath75 ) ) if t@xmath76t@xmath73 . ]    according to fig .  [ fig3](b ) and [ fig3](c ) , the t@xmath67 electrons are localized ( @xmath22=1/2 ) , while the lower e@xmath68 electron ( s=1/2 ) are itinerant , preventing them from forming local triplet states on long time scales . since the localized spins @xmath22 remain paramagnetic , they asymptotically give rise to a thermopower contribution @xmath70=k@xmath53/e ln(2 ) due to their spin entropy as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , with @xmath77 the elementary electric charge . in order to provide a constant contribution over a wide temperature range",
    ", it is here assumed that their energy level is located in an energy width of a few tens of kelvin below the fermi level and that it does not hybridize with the e@xmath68 band .",
    "we stress that the latter interpretation is consistent with the fact that these spins are also responsible for a negative magnetothermopower .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , the e@xmath68 quasiparticles are expected to contribute to the thermopower as @xmath78 t / t@xmath73 at temperatures lower than the effective fermi temperature @xmath79t@xmath36/m@xmath80 .",
    "here t@xmath36 is the bare fermi temperature and m@xmath80 is the effective mass which takes into account the electronic correlations .",
    "@xcite note that , according to plsson and kotliar , @xcite the thermopower does not depend on the scattering rate in the low temperature regime . also , a rough estimate of the effective fermi temperature inferred from the slope of s leads to a very low value ( @xmath81 ) which implies an enhanced m@xmath80 in agreement with the observed constant thermopower for t@xmath76t@xmath73 .",
