    ", we took the shortest path to formulate a conjecture relating the degree of the colored jones function of a knot with incompressible surfaces in the knot complement . in this section",

    "let us recall that in 1985 , jones introduced the famous _ jones polynomial _",
    "@xmath52 $ ] of a knot ( or link ) @xmath9 in 3-space ; @xcite .",
    "the jones polynomial of a knot is a laurent polynomial with integer coefficients that tightly encodes information about the topology and the geometry of the knot .    unlike the alexander polynomial ,",
    "not much is known about the topological meaning of the coefficients of the jones polynomial , nor about its degree , nor about the countable set of jones polynomials of knots .",
    "this unstructured behavior of the jones polynomial becomes more structured when one fixes a knot @xmath9 and considers a stronger invariant , namely the _ colored jones function _ @xmath26 .",
    "the latter is a sequence of elements of @xmath53 $ ] indexed by @xmath15 which encodes the tqft invariants of a knot colored by the irreducible @xmath54-dimensional representation of @xmath55 , and normalized to be @xmath56 at the unknot ; see @xcite . with these conventions , @xmath57 and",
    "@xmath58 is the jones polynomial of @xmath9 .    in many ways ,",
    "the sequence @xmath26 is better behaved , and suitable limits of the sequence @xmath26 have a clear topological or geometric meaning .",
    "let us give three instances of this phenomenon :    * a suitable formal power series limit @xmath59 $ ] ( known as the melvin - morton - rozansky conjecture ) equals to @xmath60 and determines the _ alexander polynomial _",
    "@xmath61 of @xmath9 ( see @xcite ) . * an analytic limit @xmath62 for small complex numbers @xmath63 near zero equals to @xmath64 also determines the alexander polynomial of @xmath9 ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* the exponential growth rate of the sequence @xmath65 ( the so - called _ kashaev invariant _ ) of a hyperbolic knot is conjectured to equal to the _ volume _ of @xmath9 , divided by @xmath66 ; see @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one can easily construct hyperbolic knots with equal jones polynomial but different alexander polynomial and volume .",
    "some already observed structure regarding the colored jones function @xmath26 is that it is @xmath5-holonomic , i.e. , it satisfies a linear recursion relation with coefficients in @xmath67 $ ] ; see @xcite .",
    "the present paper is concerned with another notion of regularity , namely the degree of the colored jones function @xmath26 with respect to @xmath31 . since little",
