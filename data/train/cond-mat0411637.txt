    "the attractive hubbard model represents an unvaluable tool to understand properties of pairing and superconductivity in systems with attractive interactions .",
    "the simplifications introduced in this model allow a comprehensive study of the evolution from the weak - coupling regime , where superconductivity is due to bcs pairing in a fermi liquid phase , and a strong coupling regime , in which the system is better described in terms of bosonic pairs , whose condensation gives rise to superconductivity ( bose einstein ( be ) superconductivity ) @xcite .",
    "it has been convincingly shown that such an evolution is a smooth crossover and the highest critical temperature is achieved in the intermediate regime where none of the limiting approaches is rigorously valid@xcite .",
    "a realization of such a crossover scenario has been recently obtained through the development of experiments on the condensation of ultracold trapped fermionic atoms@xcite . in these systems",
    "the strength of the attraction can be tuned by means of a tunable fano - feschbach resonance , and the whole crossover can be described@xcite .    in the context of high - temperature superconductivity , the intermediate - strong coupling regime in which incoherent pairs are formed well above the critical temperature has been invoked as an interpretation of the pseudogap phase@xcite . moreover , since the early days of the discovery of these materials , the evolution with the doping level of both the normal- and the superconducting - phase properties induced some authors@xcite to recognize the fingerprints of a crossover between a relatively standard bcs - like superconductivity in the overdoped materials and a strong - coupling superconductivity associated to bose - einstein condensation ( be ) in the underdoped materials .",
    "indeed at optimal doping the zero - temperature coherence length is estimated to be around 10@xmath220 @xcite , i.e. , much smaller than for conventional superconductors but still large enough to exclude the formation of local pairs.@xcite    it is understood that the attractive hubbard model has not to be taken as a microscopic model for the cuprates , since a realistic description of the copper - oxygen planes of these materials unavoidably requires a proper treatment of strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "this simplified model represents instead an ideal framework where the evolution from weak to strong coupling can be studied by simply tuning the strength of the attraction .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to identify if , and to which extent , at least some aspects of the phenomenology of the cuprates can be interpreted simply in terms of a crossover from weak to strong coupling .",
    "the main simplifications introduced by the attractive hubbard model can be summarized as _ ( i ) _ neglect of repulsion .",
    "even if some attraction has to develop at low energy , the large short - range coulomb repulsion implies that the interaction must become repulsive at high - energy in real systems . in some sense , an attractive hubbard model picture can at",
    "most be applied to the low - energy quasiparticles . _",
    "( ii ) _ the model naturally presents s - wave superconductivity , as opposed to the d - wave symmetry observed in the cuprates _",
    "( iii ) _ neglect of retardation effects .",
    "the hubbard model describes instantaneous interactions , while every physical pairing is expected to present a typical energy scale .",
    "the model is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath6 on the site @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the number operator ; @xmath9 is the hopping amplitude and @xmath10 is the hubbard on - site attraction ( we take @xmath11 , with an explicit minus sign in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "notice that , with this notations , the hamiltonian is explicitly particle - hole symmetric for @xmath12 , which therefore corresponds to @xmath13 ( half - filling ) .    despite its formal simplicity , this model can be solved exactly only in @xmath14 , while in larger dimensionality analytical calculations are typically limited to weak ( @xmath15 ) or strong ( @xmath16 ) coupling , where the bcs and the be approaches are reliable approximations .",
    "it is anyway known that for @xmath17 , the ground state of ( [ hubbard ] ) is superconducting for all values of @xmath10 and all densities @xmath18 , with the only exception of the one - dimensional half - filled case . at half - filling the model",
    "has an extra - symmetry and the superconducting and the charge - density - wave order parameters become degenerate .    a reliable description of the evolution of the physics as a function of @xmath10 requires to treat the two limiting regimes on equal footing overcoming the drawbacks of perturbative expansions .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations represent a valuable tool in this regard , and they have been applied to the two@xcite and three@xcite dimensional attractive hubbard model .",
    "even if the sign problem does not affect these simulations , finite size effects and memory requirements still partially limit the potentiality of this approach .",
    "a different non perturbative approach is the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , that neglects the spatial correlations beyond the mean field level in order to fully retain the local quantum dynamics , and becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions@xcite . due to the local nature of the interaction in the attractive hubbard model",
    ", we expect that the physics of local pairing is well described in dmft . moreover , this approach is not biased toward metallic or insulating states , and it is therefore particularly useful to analyze the be - bcs crossover . on the other hand ,",
    "the simplifications introduced by the dmft are rigorously valid only in the infinite dimensionality limit , and even if the dmft has obtained many successes for three dimensional systems , its relevance to lower dimensionality like @xmath19 is much less established , and represents a fourth limitation of our study in light of a comparison with the physics of the cuprates",
    ". in particular , the role of dimensionality in determining the pseudogap properties of the attractive hubbard model has been discussed in refs .",

    "the study of the attractive hubbard model can greatly benefit of a mapping onto a repulsive model in a magnetic field .",
    "the mapping is realized in a bipartite lattice@xcite by a staggered particle - hole transformation on the down spins @xmath20 .",
    "the attractive model with a finite density @xmath18 transforms into a half - filled repulsive model with a finite magnetization @xmath21 .",
    "the chemical potential is transformed , accordingly , into a magnetic field @xmath22 . in the @xmath13 case ( half - filling ) the two models are therefore completely equivalent .",
    "we notice that the above mapping does not only hold for the normal phases , but extends to the broken symmetry solutions .",
    "the three components of the antiferromagnetic order parameter of the repulsive hubbard model are in fact mapped onto a staggered charge - density - wave parameter ( @xmath23 component of the spin ) and an s - wave superconducting order parameter ( @xmath24 components ) .",
    "the above mapping is extremely useful , since it allows to exploit all the known results for the repulsive model and for the mott - hubbard transition to improve our understanding of the attractive model .    in recent works",

    ", a phase transition has been found both at finite@xcite and at zero temperature@xcite between a metallic solution and an pairing phase of pairs .",
    "the insulating pairs phase is nothing but a realization of a superconductor without phase coherence , i.e. , a collection of independent pairs . as it has been discussed in ref.@xcite , this phase is the negative-@xmath10 counterpart of the paramagnetic mott insulator found for the repulsive hubbard model .",
    "we notice that the insulating character of the pairing phase is a limitation of the dmft approach , in which the residual kinetic energy of the preformed pairs is not described .",

    "the @xmath27 curve , extracted from the divergence of the pair - correlation function in the normal phase , displays a clear maximum at intermediate coupling and reproduces correctly both the bcs and the be predictions in the asymptotic limits , remaining finite for all @xmath29 .    in this work",
    "we complement the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , by extending our phase diagram to finite temperature , still using exact diagonalization ( ed ) to solve the impurity model associated with the dmft of the hubbard model@xcite .",
    "we also compare the normal state solutions with the superconducting solutions which are stable at low temperatures .",
    "the use of ed allows us to reach arbitrarily small temperatures which are hardly accessible by means of qmc .",
    "quite naturally , the extension of ed to finite temperature requires a more severe truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "we have checked that all the thermodynamical quantities we show are only weakly dependent on the truncation .",

    "vi contains our concluding remarks .",
    "the dmft extends the concept of classical mean - field theories to quantum problems , by describing a lattice model in terms of an effective dynamical local theory .",
    "the latter can be represented through an impurity model subject to a self - consistency condition , which contains all the information about the original lattice structure through the non - interacting density of states ( dos)@xcite . starting from the hubbard model ( [ hubbard ] ) , we obtain an attractive anderson impurity model @xmath30 the self - consistency is expressed by requiring the identity between the local self - energy of the lattice model and the impurity self - energy @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the local green s function of ( [ aim ] ) , and @xmath33 is the dynamical weiss field , related to the parameters in ( [ aim ] ) by @xmath34 by expressing the local component of the green s function in terms of the lattice green s function , namely @xmath35 , eq .",

( [ selfconsistence ] ) is greatly simplified and becomes @xmath40    in this work we also consider solutions with explicit s - wave superconducting order , by allowing for local anomalous green s functions @xmath41 .",
    "the whole dmft formalism can then be recast in nambu - gorkov spinorial representation@xcite , and eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ selfconsistence ] ) must be read as matrix identities in the nambu space . as far as the impurity model is concerned",
    ", we need to describe an anderson impurity model with a superconducting bath or , equivalently , with an anomalous hybridization in which cooper pairs are created and destroyed in the electronic bath , i.e. , a term @xmath42 is added to ( [ aim ] ) .",
    "the heaviest step of the dmft approach is to compute @xmath32 for the anderson model ( [ aim ] ) .",
    "this solution requires either a numerical approach or some approximation .",
    "here we use exact diagonalization .",

    "( [ aim ] ) and ( [ g0 ] ) to a finite number of levels @xmath44 .",
    "it has been shown that extremely small values of @xmath44 provide really good results for thermodynamic properties and reliable results for spectral functions . in this work",
    "we use the ed approach at finite temperature , where it is not possible to use the lanczos algorithm , which allows to find the groundstate of extremely large matrices . to obtain the full spectrum of the hamiltonian , needed to compute the finite - temperature properties ,",
    "we are forced to a rather small value of @xmath44 , up to 6 .",
    "all the results presented here are for @xmath45 , and we always checked that changing @xmath44 from 5 to 6 does not affect the relevant observables we discuss in the present work , except for the real - frequency spectral properties .",
    "in this section we limit our analysis to normal phase paramagnetic solutions in which no superconducting ordering is allowed . even if the s - wave superconducting solution is expected to be the stable one at low temperatures , our normal state solutions are representative of the normal phase above the critical temperature .",
    "the region in which the normal state is stable may of course be enlarged by frustrating superconductivity through , e.g. , a magnetic field .",
    "moreover , the nature of the normal phase gives important indications on the nature of the pairing in the different regions of the phase diagram .",
    "as mentioned above , it has been shown that the normal phase of the attractive hubbard model is characterized by a `` pairing '' transition between a fermi - liquid phase and a phase in which the electrons are paired , but without any phase coherence among the pairs .",
    "the pairing transition has been first discussed at finite temperature in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a complete characterization at @xmath25 has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we complete the finite temperature study of the transition and connect it to the zero - temperature phase diagram , finally drawing a complete phase diagram in the attraction - temperature plane for a density @xmath46 , taken as representative of a generic density ( except for the peculiar particle - hole symmetric @xmath13 case ) .",
    "this situation would correspond to a repulsive model at half - filling in an external magnetic field tuned to give a finite magnetization @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath25 dmft solution of the attractive hubbard model is characterized by the existence of two distinct solutions , a metallic one with a finite spectral weight at the fermi level and an insulating solution formed by pairs , with no weight at the fermi level .",
    "the previous study has also clarified that the quasiparticle weight @xmath48 , which may be used as a sort of order parameter for the mott transition at half - filling , loses this role for the doped attractive hubbard model , being it finite both in the metallic and pairing phases . at @xmath25 ,",
    "the metallic solution exists only for @xmath49 , and the insulating one for @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , a coexistence region is present where both solutions exist , and where the actual ground state is determined minimizing the internal energy .    .",
    "in each panel are shown the metallic ( @xmath52 ) and insulating ( @xmath53 ) solutions .",
    "( the chosen value of the attraction lies in the coexistence region).,width=245 ]        the clear - cut @xmath25 characterization of the two solutions based by the low - energy spectral weight is lost at finite temperature , where both solution have finite weight at the fermi level .",
    "nonetheless , two families of solutions can still be defined , each family being obtained by continuous evolution of the different @xmath25 phases .",

    "while at @xmath55 and @xmath56 the difference in the two solutions is still clear , at @xmath57 , the two solutions become basically indistinguishable .",
    "this result suggests that , as intuitively expected , the temperature reduces the difference between the solutions and consequently , the size of the coexistence region , which is expected to close at some finite temperature critical point ( the attractive counterpart of the endpoint of the line of metal - insulator transitions in the repulsive model @xcite ) . a similar information is carried by the analysis of the average value of double occupancy @xmath58 .",
    "this quantity naturally discriminates between an pairing phase with a large value of @xmath59 and a metal with a smaller value . as shown in fig .",
    "[ doubocc ] , at low temperature we have two solutions with a different value of @xmath59 in the coexistence region , and a jump in this quantity at the transition . upon increasing the temperature ,",
    "the two solutions tend to join smoothly one onto the other , signaling again the closure of the coexistence region , which is substituted by a crossover region .",
    "analogous behavior is displayed by the quasiparticle weight @xmath60 .    repeating the same analysis for a wide range of coupling constants and temperatures , we are able to construct a finite - temperature phase diagram for the pairing transition , shown in fig .",
    "for temperatures smaller than a critical temperature @xmath61 , we compute the finite temperature extensions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which mark the boundary of the coexistence region .",

    "the crossover region is `` negatively '' defined as the range in which the green s function does not resemble any of the two low temperature phases .",
    "the crossover lines are estimated as the points in which it becomes impossible to infer from the matsubara frequency green s function whether the low - energy behavior is metallic or insulating .",
    "it has been shown for the repulsive hubbard model that this kind of crossover is accompanied by a qualitative difference in transport properties . in the region on the left of the crossover ,",
    "the conduction is metallic and the resistivity increases with temperature . in the intermediate crossover region the system behaves like a semiconductor with a resistivity which decreases upon heating , and finally in the phase on the right of the crossover region the system behaves like a heated insulator@xcite .    coming from the left ,",
    "the first crossover occurs when @xmath32 has no longer a clear metallic behavior with a finite value at zero frequency , while the second crossover line delimits the region in which the gap of the paired solution is closed by thermal excitations .",

    "it has been shown numerically that the insulator becomes stable in a large portion of the coexistence region due to its large entropy@xcite .",

    "@xcite , we find the pairing phase stable for almost every point in the coexistence region .",
    "we had to use an extremely dense mesh of points in the @xmath10 direction to identify a small section where the metallic phase is stable at finite temperature .",

    "interestingly , the maximum @xmath27 occurs almost exactly at the coupling for which the pairing transition in the normal phase would take place in the absence of superconductivity .",
    "it might be noticed however that , while the be result ( open triangles in fig .",
    "[ tc ] ) basically falls on top of the dmft results , the bcs formula ( open circles ) only qualitatively follows the full solution .",
    "this `` asymmetry '' in recovering the bcs behavior arises from the partial screening of the bare attraction due to second order polarization terms@xcite . because of these corrections",
    "the attraction is renormalized as @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 .",
    "when this correction is plugged in the bcs formula for @xmath27 , it results in a correction to the prefactor .",
    "if we simply extract the rescaling factor for a given small value of @xmath10 ( @xmath77 ) and we simply scale the whole weak - coupling curve by this factor , we obtain the points marked with asterisks , whose agreement with the dmft results does not require further comments .",
    "it is interesting , instead , to compare the dmft estimations for @xmath27 with the qmc results : despite the presence of many factors ( such as the exact shape of the d.o.s . of the model or the finite dimension effects ) which are capable to introduce relevant variations in the values of @xmath27 ,",
    "some general similarities appear clearly .",

    "the whole phase transition is hidden by superconductivity , which remains as the only real instability of the system ( cfr .",
    "nevertheless , the crossover lines at higher temperature survive the onset of superconductivity .",
    "therefore the normal phase we reach for @xmath1 is really different according to the regime of coupling we are in . for weak - coupling ,",
    "the normal phase is substantially a regular fermi - liquid and superconductivity occurs as the standard bcs instability . in the strong - coupling regime , the normal phase is instead a more correlated phase which presents a pseudogap in the spectrum . at intermediate coupling , where the superconducting critical temperature reaches its maximum , the normal phase is in a crossover region between the two limiting behaviors .",
    "even if the onset of superconductivity completely hides the pairing transition , the fingerprints of the low - temperature normal phase are still visible in the high - temperature phase diagram , in which a crossover from a metallic phase to a gapped phase is still present .",
    "it is tempting to associate the region in which the system behaves as a collection of incoherent pairs to the pseudogap regime of the cuprates .",
    "it is important to underline that , in this framework , the definition of the pseudogap phase is somewhat tricky , and it implies a certain degree of arbitrariness . in this section we come back to this region and compute various observable whose anomalies have been used to identify the pseudogap phase and compare the related estimates of the pseudogap temperature @xmath88 .    our first estimate is based on the evaluation of the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath89 as a function of temperature for different attraction strengths . the opening of a gap in the spin excitation spectrum , not associated with any long - range order , represented in fact one of the first indications of existence of the pseudogap phase in high - temperature superconductors .",

    "when the temperature is further reduced @xmath89 starts to decrease , exponentially approaching zero in the @xmath25 limit , signaling the opening of a gap in the spin - excitation spectrum .",
    "a qualitatively similar behavior is found also in the intermediate - coupling regime , at least as long as the value of @xmath10 stays larger than @xmath100 ( e.g. , @xmath101 ) , or , in other words , as long as the left line defining the crossover region in fig .",
    "[ phd ] is not crossed .",
    "the behavior of @xmath89 becomes richer for @xmath102 . at high temperatures @xmath89",
    "closely resembles the insulating case , displaying a clear maximum at a temperature @xmath99 . by approaching @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath89 no longer vanishes , but it rises at small temperatures displaying a minimum for a temperature lower than @xmath99 : a metallic behavior is therefore recovered , associated to the narrow resonance at the fermi level@xcite .",
    "such a behavior naturally defines a different temperature scale @xmath103 , which is associated to the minimum of @xmath89 and represents the lower border of the pairing zone , or in a sense , of the `` pseudogap '' region .",
    "conversely , this low - temperature behavior has not been observed to our knowledge in finite - dimensional qmc simulation @xcite . in practice , the system displays a pseudogap behavior in the region between @xmath103 and @xmath99 , whose boundary , labeled as @xmath104 , is represented in fig .",

    "however , also in this case the ratio between @xmath109 and @xmath78 has a more universal value around @xmath110 .",
    "another relevant quantity is the specific heat @xmath111 , that we obtain by differentiating a fit to the dmft internal energy @xmath112 for the same attraction strengths and report in fig .",
    ". also for this quantity the weak coupling case ( @xmath113 ) behaves as a regular metal , with a linear behavior at small temperatures ( @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , @xmath116 being the effective mass ) .",
    "followed by a smooth decrease when the temperature exceeds the typical electronic energy scale .",
    "the same qualitative result is found for the noninteracting system , where the low-@xmath67 slope is smaller since the interacting system has a larger effective mass . in the opposite strong coupling limit",
    "we observe the typical activated behavior of gapped systems for small temperatures , with an exponential dependence of @xmath117 which extends up to a temperature @xmath118 large enough to wipe out the effect of the gap .",
    "it is therefore natural to associate such a temperature to the closure of the pseudogap .    in the most interesting @xmath119 case ,",
    "two features are clearly present in the @xmath117 curve .",
    "the first , low - temperature feature is the evolution of the small-@xmath10 metallic feature , which acquires a larger slope as @xmath120 is increased due to the enhancement of the effective mass , and shrinks as a consequence of the reduced coherence temperature of the metal .",
    "the second feature is instead the evolution of the large-@xmath10 insulating one , and would show an activated behavior partially hidden by the low-@xmath67 metallic peak .",
    "thus , the system behaves like a metal in the small temperature range , while it has a pseudogap for intermediate temperature .",

    "unfortunately , the discretization of the hilbert space which allows for an ed solution results in `` spiky '' local spectral functions formed by a collection of @xmath127-functions . in this light",
    ", we find it useful to compute @xmath128 by analytically continuing eq.([sigma ] ) , analytically computing the local retarded green function @xmath129 .",
    "this procedure provides more `` realistic '' descriptions of both the non - interacting dos and of the strong - coupling pairing phase .",
    "however , even though the spectral functions are smoothed by this procedure , we can only extract informations about the gross features of the spectra as , e.g. , the amplitude of the gap @xmath130 . keeping these limitations in mind ,",

    "apart from the obvious appearing and enlarging of a gap in @xmath128 with increasing @xmath10 , which is evident in the low - temperature data , it should be noticed that both in the intermediate and the strong - coupling regime there is apparently no tendency to a closure of such a gap when the temperature is raised . indeed , as it is shown in the second and the third row of fig .",
    "[ spectral ] , the gap starts to fill at some temperature ( @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 for @xmath131 ) , but for these values of @xmath10 much of the spectral weight remains in the high - energy hubbard bands , and the gapped structure does not completely vanish up to the highest temperature reached in our calculation ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "on the other hand , qmc results in @xmath19@xcite obtained through maximum entropy show a closure of the gap in @xmath128 at a temperature lower that our threshold .",
    "further investigation is needed to understand whether the discrepancy is due to a different behavior between @xmath19 and the infinite dimensionality limit , or it is determined by the technical difficulties involved in the calculation of real frequency spectra in both approaches .",
    "the persistence of the gap structure at high temperature that we find in dmft is also obtained within a perturbative analysis of superconducting fluctuations at strong coupling in @xmath19@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ tstar ] we compare our estimates of the pseudogap temperature obtained through different physical quantities .",
    "we draw the borders of the pseudogap region as determined from the spin susceptibility ( @xmath136 ) and the specific - heat behavior ( @xmath137 and the value of the superconducting gap @xmath138 at zero temperature : the upper borders of the spin and the specific - heat `` pseudogap '' region scale roughly with @xmath10 , as @xmath138 does , so that both @xmath137 and @xmath139 are proportional to @xmath138 , as the experimentally determined pseudogap . at low temperature ,",
    "the pseudogap region boundary as extracted from thermodynamic response functions displays a clear re - entrance , which can be associated with the onset of the low - temperature quasi - particle peak .",
    "we also notice that the low - temperature curve qualitatively follows the behavior of the @xmath69 line .",
    "as mentioned above , the slope of @xmath69 is easily interpreted in terms of entropy balance between the two phases , which favors the preformed pairs phase .",
    "our phase diagram also represents a warning regarding attempts to extrapolate the low - temperature behavior from the high - temperature data in order to compare with finite - dimensional qmc calculations . if one , as , e.g. , in ref .",
    ", extrapolated the high - temperature behavior down to @xmath25 in order to estimate the metal - insulator point , would have obtained an estimate of @xmath140 significantly lower than the real @xmath63 .",
    "this finding emphasize how the high - temperature properties of the attractive hubbard model are only weakly dependent on dimensionality , as indicated by the similarity between dmft and finite - dimension qmc , while the low - temperature behavior may well be dependent on the dimensionality , as well as on the details of the bandstructure of the underlying lattice .    , i.e. , the temperatures of both the maxima and the minima of @xmath141 , while the empty circle marked @xmath142 that is the temperature associated with the maxima and the minima of @xmath117 .",
    "the regions on the left of these two lines can be interpreted as the zone of `` pseudogap '' behavior for the spin and the specific heat respectively .",
    "these lines are then compared with the behavior of the anomalous part of the self - energy at zero temperature ( @xmath138 , empty triangles).,width=321 ]",
    "in this paper we have investigated the finite temperature aspects of pairing and superconductivity in the attractive hubbard model by means of dmft , considering both normal and superconducting solutions .    in the normal phase",
    "we have identified two families of solutions , a fermi - liquid metallic phase and a preformed - pair phase with insulating character . the latter phase is formed by local pairs without phase coherence .",
    "a finite region of the coupling - temperature phase diagram is characterized by the simultaneous presence of both solutions . in the low temperature regime",
    "a first - order transition occurs within this region when the free energies of the two solutions cross , and the region closes at a certain temperature ( @xmath143 ) in a critical point .",
    "interestingly , some trace of the two solutions survives even for temperature larger than the critical temperature , and two crossover lines can be defined separating a normal metal , a sort of semiconductor in which the gap is closed by temperature , and the preformed - pair phase with a well defined gap .",
    "when superconductivity is allowed , the superconducting solution is stable for all values of the attraction and the critical temperature is always larger than the pairing transition temperature in the normal phase . in the superconducting state , we find an evolution from a weak - coupling bcs - like behavior , with exponentially small @xmath27 from a normal metal to the superconductor , and a strong - coupling regime in which superconductivity is associated to the onset of the phase - coherence among the preformed pairs that occurs at @xmath144 .",
    "the highest @xmath27 is obtained in the intermediate region between this two limiting cases , namely for @xmath145 , which is extremely close to the zero - temperature critical point of the normal phase .",
    "the presence of the pairing transition affects the normal phase above @xmath27 also when superconductivity establishes . in particular",
    ", one could be tempted to identify the phase of preformed pairs obtained at strong coupling with the pseudogap behavior observed in cuprates . in order to test the adequacy of such an identification",
    ", we computed different observables , whose anomalies can identify the appearance of the pseudogap , like the spin susceptibility , the specific heat and the single particle spectral functions . in the intermediate region of coupling , where the pairing transition occurs and the superconducting critical temperature reaches its maximum , the pseudogap region presents a re - entrance at low temperatures associated with a small coherent peak in the spectral function . at temperatures smaller than this coherence temperature",
    "the system behaves like a normal metal with renormalized effective mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - temperature boundary of the pseudogap region scales with @xmath10 regardless the criterion we use to estimate it .",
    "the estimate of the pseudogap temperature from specific heat and spin susceptibility both scale with the zero - temperature gap , as in the cuprates .",
    "the most striking difference between our pseudogap phase - diagram and the experiments in the cuprates is that the pseudogap phase in the attractive hubbard model is much larger than the experimental one , as it is measured by the large value of @xmath146 at the optimal value of the attraction .",
    "the experimental @xmath88 around optimal doping is instead very close to @xmath27 , and , according to some authors , the pseudogap line tends to zero at optimal doping .",
    "moreover , the pseudogap temperature observed in the cuprates is definitely much smaller than the one found within our dmft of the attractive hubbard model .",
    "this inadequacy of the attractive hubbard model in describing some features of the pseudogap phase descend from the above mentioned strong simplifications of the model ( neglect of retardation effects , coulomb repulsion and d - wave symmetry of the gap ) and of our dmft treatment which is exact only in the infinite dimensionality limit .",
    "one could be tempted in maintaining an attractive hubbard model description for the quasiparticles alone , but it is important to point out that this interpretation can not be pushed too far . as an example , it is clear that such a description would fail for temperatures larger than the quasiparticle renormalized bandwidth .",
    "a better description of the pseudogap phase would require models in which both an attraction and a repulsion are present .",
    "this is for instance the case of the models introduced in refs . , where the superconducting phenomenon only involves heavy quasiparticles which experience an unscreened attraction and a richer behavior of the pseudogap ( which in this case closes around optimal doping ) is found .",
    "this work is also supported by miur cofin 2003 .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with s. ciuchi , m. grilli , and g. sangiovanni ."
