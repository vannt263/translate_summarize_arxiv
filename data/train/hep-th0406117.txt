    "the `` greybody factor '' @xmath8 is an important quantity to understand the absorption and emission phenomena of a black hole .",
    "it is this factor which makes a black hole to be different from a black body .",
    "the physical origin of this factor is an effective potential barrier generated by a black hole spacetime .",
    "for example , the potential for the massless scalar generated by the @xmath7 schwarzschild spacetime is @xmath9 when the wave equation is expressed in terms of the `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an horizon radius and @xmath3 is an angular momentum of the scalar .",
    "this potential generally backscatters a part of the outgoing radiation quantum machanically , which results in the frequency - dependent greybody factor @xmath8 .",
    "this factor , therefore , appears in the black hole s thermal radiation formula @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an hawking temperature .",
    "eq.([radiation1 ] ) shows how the greybody factor and the planck factor play important roles in the emission rate of energy .",
    "in addition to the radiation formula ( [ radiation1 ] ) the factor @xmath8 is important to compute the partial absorption cross section @xmath14 of the black hole .",
    "the explicit relation and @xmath8 in higher dimensions is given in eq.([optical ] ) .",
    "] between @xmath14 and @xmath8 for the @xmath7 massive scalar is @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 is particle s mass . thus one can compute @xmath18 from @xmath19 straightforwardly or _ vice versa_.",
    "many computational techniques for calculation of the absorption cross section in the various @xmath7 black hole were developed long ago@xcite .",
    "the main streams of this procedure are to derive the solutions of the given wave equation in the near - horizon and asymptotic regimes separately and to match them in the appropriate intermediate place .",
    "following this procedure unruh@xcite computed the low energy absorption cross section for the massive scalar and dirac fermion in the @xmath7 schwarzschild background .",
    "it is instructive to introduce an explicit expression of ref.@xcite for the massive scalar : @xmath20 }              \\prod_{s = 1}^{\\ell }              \\left[s^2 + \\left(\\frac{k ( 1 + v^2)}{2 v } \\right)^2 \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the most interesting one eq.([unruh1 ] ) suggests is the fact that the low - energy absorption cross section for s - wave is equal to the horizon area in the massless limit .",
    "this is an universal property for the minimally coupled massless scalar .",
    "this universality indicates that the low - energy cross section encodes information on the near - horizon structure of black hole .",
    "another interesting result of ref.@xcite is the fact that the low - energy absorption cross section for dirac fermion with mass @xmath21 is exactly @xmath5 of that for scalar with mass @xmath17 if @xmath22 .",
    "it is still unclear at least for us the physical origin of this ratio factor .",
    "the universality is re - examined in the arbitrary dimensional spherically symmetric black hole@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite has shown that the low - energy absorption cross sections for scalar is equal to the horizon area while that for spin-@xmath23 particle is an area measured in a flat spatial metric conformally related to the true metric .",
    "the universality for the minimally coupled massless scalar is extended to the @xmath24-brane - like objects@xcite and its generalization to the massive scalar is discussed recently@xcite . in particular , it is shown in ref.@xcite that the mass - dependence of the absorption cross section is very sensitive to the near - horizon structure of spacetime .    the computation of the low - energy absorption cross section is also important subject in the context of string theories and brane - world scenario . in string theories the black hole",
    "is effectively represented by a collective states@xcite and the relevant low energy excitations of this effective description are the right- and left - moving modes of the string .",
    "the computation of the low - energy absorption cross section with this picture suggests that the effective string theory for the black hole is `` heterotic '' , _",
    "i.e. _ the right - moving sector has both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom , while the left - moving sector has only bosonic degree of freedom@xcite .    in the context of the brane - world scenario",
    "the most remarkable fact is that the fundamental planck mass can be low as a tev scale .",
    "this tev - scale gravity is realized by making use of the large extra dimensions@xcite or warped extra dimensions@xcite .",
    "one of the striking consequences arising due to the tev - scale gravity is that the future high - energy colliders such as the cern large hadron collider can be a black hole factory@xcite .",
    "if the black holes can be really produced in the future collider , one can examine the quantum gravity effects of black hole in the laboratory such as hawking radiation and/or information loss problem@xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate the absorption and emission problems in this context .",
    "recently works along this direction were done@xcite . in ref.@xcite the low - energy absorption problems for massless bulk and brane - localized scalar are examined . in ref.@xcite same problems for brane - localized massless particle with spin @xmath23 and @xmath25 are examined .",
    "the absorption and emission problems for the brane - localized particles in the full range of energy are numerically studied in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to extend ref.@xcite by considering the massive spin-@xmath26 and spin-@xmath23 particles in the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild background .",
    "although the spin can be introduced in the curved spacetime with ease by making use of the newman - penrose formalism@xcite , we will introduce it in the more traditional dirac form . in section ii we will compute the low - energy absorption cross section for the brane - localized massive scalar .",
    "it is shown in this section that our final result for the low - energy absorption cross section has a correct massless limit .",
    "however , the @xmath7 limit of it is not exactly same with eq.([unruh1 ] ) , but coincides with the low - energy expansion of eq.([unruh1 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is explained in the appendix . in section",
    "iii the low - energy absorption cross section for the massive dirac fermion is computed by solving dirac equation .",
    "the final form of the low - energy absorption cross section @xmath27 , where @xmath1 is a total angular momentum , is just sum of two contributions from orbital angular momenta @xmath2 , _ i.e. _ @xmath28 . while the introduction of spin via usual newman - penrose formalism generally does not allow to compute each contribution , our introduction of spin enables us to compute @xmath29 and @xmath30 separately .",
    "it is shown in this section that the contribution from lower @xmath3-state is larger than that from higher @xmath3-state in the massive case",
    ". however , these two contributions to @xmath27 are exactly same in the massless limit .",
    "it is also shown that the ratio of the absorption cross section for massive scalar and massive dirac fermion is @xmath31 , which gives a factor @xmath5 when @xmath6 as unruh found . in section",
    "iv the low - energy absorption cross section for bulk scalar is computed .",
    "it is shown that the massless and s - wave limit of our result for the absorption cross section is same with the area of the horizon hypersurface .",
    "thus , the universality for s - wave is preserved in the higher - dimensional theories . in section v a brief conclusion is given .",
    "the various higher - dimensional black hole solutions of the einstein equation were discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the explicit expression of the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild solution in terms of the usual schwarzschild coordinates is in the following : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and the angular part is given by @xmath34 the horizon radius @xmath11 is related to the black hole mass @xmath35 as following : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a @xmath0-dimensional planck mass and @xmath38 is a newton constant .",
    "since we are interested in the scalar localized on the brane in this section , we assume the scalar field @xmath39 is a function of only @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , letting @xmath44 yields a following radial equation @xmath45 + \\left[\\omega^2 - h(r ) \\left\\{m^2 + \\frac{\\ell ( \\ell + 1)}{r^2 } \\right\\ }                                          \\right ] r = 0.\\ ] ]    for the quantum - mechanical interpretation we can change eq.([radial1 ] ) into the following schrdinger - like equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 }                                { r^2 }                        - ( 1 - h ) m^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unlike the usual @xmath7 black hole case the schrdinger - like equation ( [ schro1 ] ) involves not only the effective potential but also the effective position - dependent mass .",
    "thus , it seems to be difficult to get a direct quantum - mechanical interpretation from ( [ schro1 ] ) .",
    "however , one can roughly estimate the effect of extra dimension in the absorption cross section . for simplicity",
    "let us consider the massless limit .",
    "the effective potential as a function of @xmath48 is plotted in fig . 1 at fixed @xmath3 .",
    "1 indicates that the potential barrier height seems to increase with increasing the number of extra dimensions .",
    "since the greybody factor usually decreases when potential barrier becomes higher and the absorption cross section is proportional to this factor , one can conjecture that the existence of the extra dimensions may reduces the absorption cross section , which explains fig . 1 of ref.@xcite",
    ". the detailed analysis of the schrdinger - like equation ( [ schro1 ] ) will be discussed elsewhere .    in ref.@xcite unruh derived the low - energy absorption cross section by solving the wave equation , _",
    "i.e. _ the corresponding equation of eq.([radial1 ] ) in @xmath7 schwarzschild black hole , in the near - horizon , asymptotic and intermediate regions separately and matching the near - horizon and asymptotic solutions via the solution in the intermediate region .",
    "one may follow this procedure , but it seems to be impossible unlike @xmath7 case to derive a solution in the intermediate region analytically .",
    "thus , we adopt an alternative method introduced by maldacena and strominger in ref.@xcite .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , however , this alternative method does not work when we discuss the absorption problem for dirac fermion . in that case",
    "we will adopt the unruh s original method .    changing a variable makes eq.([radial1 ] ) to be @xmath49 r = 0.\\ ] ] in the near - horizon region , _",

    "putting @xmath57 makes eq.([radial1 ] ) in the following simple form ; @xmath58 r_{ff } = 0\\ ] ] which yields an solution in terms of the usual bessel function as following : @xmath59.\\ ] ]    to match the near - horizon solution @xmath55 in eq.([nearh1 ] ) with @xmath54 and the far - field @xmath60 in eq.([asymp2 ] ) , we change the near - horizon solution as following : @xmath61.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking @xmath55 in eq.([transf1 ] ) to @xmath62 and @xmath60 in eq.([asymp2 ] ) to @xmath63 naturally yields two relations , one between @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the other between @xmath64 and @xmath66 . then removing @xmath64 yields @xmath67    computing the flux in the asymptotic region",
    ", one can calculate the greybody factor whose expression is @xmath68 the last approximation in eq.([grey1 ] ) comes from the low - energy approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath69 . inserting eq.([bbb1 ] ) into eq.([grey1 ] ) makes the greybody factor to be @xmath70 then the partial absorption cross section @xmath18 can be read straightforwardly from eq.([grey2 ] ) ; @xmath71    it is interesting to consider several limiting cases .",
    "firstly , let us consider the massless limit , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath72 .",
    "then the partial absorption cross section reduces to @xmath73 which is exactly same with the result of ref.@xcite . in @xmath74 limit eq.([partial1 ] ) becomes @xmath75 which coincides with eq.([unruh1 ] ) if we expands eq.([unruh1 ] ) by making use of @xmath76 limit .",
    "thus our result ( [ partial1 ] ) recovers not only the massless limit but also @xmath7 limit .    at this stage one",
    "may question why our @xmath7 limit is not exactly eq.([unruh1 ] ) but low - energy expansion of it .",
    "in fact , unruh derived eq.([unruh1 ] ) by expressing the asymptotic solution in terms of the coulomb wave functions .",
    "the multiplicative factor and exponential factor in eq.([unruh1 ] ) are results of these coulomb wave functions . in appendix , however , we will show that the expression of asymptotic solution in terms of the coulomb wave functions is impossible except @xmath6 .",
    "this is why the @xmath7 limit of our result gives the low - energy expansion of eq.([unruh1 ] ) .",
    "in this section we will compute the low - energy absorption cross section for the massive dirac fermion in the schwarzschild background defined on the bulk . as commented earlier , spin of the particle",
    "can be introduced more conveniently by exploiting the newman - penrose formalism .",
    "however , it is more straightforward to introduce it in the traditional dirac form , which we will follow in this section .",
    "as will be shown shortly , furthermore , our introduction of spin enables us to compute each contribution to the low - energy partial absorption cross section .",
    "the usual newman - penrose formalism does not provide this information .",
    "it usually gives the total sum of it .",
    "thus , we can determine which contribution is dominant .",
    "let us start with dirac equation @xmath77 \\psi = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a mass of the fermion and @xmath78 is a spin - affine connection .",
    "since we are interested in the dirac fermion localized on the brane , we assume @xmath79 is function of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath80 and @xmath43 .",
    "the gamma matrices in this background can be easily chosen as @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the ordinary flat - space dirac matrices defined @xmath86 and @xmath87 are usual pauli matrices .",
    "the spin - affine connection in the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild background can be straightforwardly computed with use of the affine connections and the results are @xmath88 then , dirac operator @xmath89 reduces to @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92    in order to perform the separation of variables we take an following ansatz @xmath93 where @xmath94 is angle - dependent two - component spinor .",
    "then , it is straightforward to derive two radial equations @xmath95 where @xmath96 is defined from the angular equation @xmath97 the angular equation was discussed long ago by schrdinger@xcite and the constant @xmath96 is related to the orbital angular momentum @xmath3 by @xmath98 and to the total angular momentum @xmath1 by @xmath99@xcite .",
    "thus , for example , the lowest quantum number @xmath100 corresponds to @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .    removing the low component @xmath105 in eq.([df - radial1 ] ) , we can finally derive a second - order radial differential equation : @xmath106 g = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath107 and @xmath108 is defined as @xmath109 it is important to note that the new variable @xmath108 goes to @xmath110 in the near - horizon region and @xmath111 in the asymptotic region .",
    "due to the @xmath112 in eq.([df - radial2 ] ) , the method of maldacena and strominger in ref.@xcite does not work in this case .",
    "thus , we will adopt the method unruh did in ref.@xcite .",
    "eq.([df - radial2 ] ) indicates that the radial equation in the near - horizon becomes simply @xmath113 which makes the following outgoing wave @xmath114    in the intermediate region where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are much smaller than the other terms the radial equation ( [ df - radial2 ] ) reduces to @xmath117          g_{im } = 0.\\ ] ] defining @xmath118 we can change eq.([df - inter1 ] ) into the first - order differential equation in the form @xmath119 the solution of ( [ df - inter3 ] ) is @xmath120 therefore , inserting eq.([df - inter4 ] ) into eq.([df - inter2 ] ) , we can obtain the following @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a particular solution to @xmath124 for @xmath125 we obtain @xmath126 whereas for @xmath127 we can show @xmath128       \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    in the asymptotic region eq.([df - radial2 ] ) reduces to @xmath129 g_{ff } = 0.\\ ] ]    since @xmath111 in the asymptotic region , the solution of eq.([df - ff1 ] ) can be written as @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",

    "the relation between the absorption cross section and the greybody factor can be derived using the @xmath0-dimensional optical theorem @xcite @xmath210 where @xmath211 is an area of the horizon hypersurface @xmath212    the most important quantity is a low - energy absorption cross section for s - wave , which is derived by letting @xmath102 in eq.([optical ] ) @xmath213 thus , at the massless limit the absorption cross section for s - wave exactly coincides with the area of the horizon hypersurface @xmath211 , which is an higher dimensional generalization of the universality .",
    "the @xmath7 limit of @xmath18 is easily computed by letting @xmath214 , which is exactly same with eq.([noextra1 ] ) .",
    "also the massless limit of eq.([optical ] ) exactly coincides with eq.(5.4 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "thus our result has correct @xmath7 and massless limits .",
    "the low - energy absorption cross section for the brane - localized massive scalar , brane - localized massive dirac fermion , and massive bulk scalar are explicitly computed when the background is @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild spacetime .    for the case of the brane - localized massive scalar",
    "our result ( [ partial1 ] ) has a correct massless limit .",
    "but the @xmath7 limit of eq.([partial1 ] ) is not exactly same with the unruh s @xmath7 result ( [ unruh1 ] ) , but coincides with its low - energy expansion .",
    "the reason for this is clarified in the appendix .    for the case of the brane - localized dirac fermion we introduced the particle s spin using the traditional dirac form instead of the newman - penrose formalism .",
    "thus , we should compute the spin - affine connections and separate the dirac equation to derive a radial equation , which were performed explicitly in section iii .",
    "our introduction of spin enables us to compute the contributions to the low - energy absorption cross section from the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath3 . since , for spin-@xmath23 particle , total angular momentum quantum number @xmath1 is contributed from @xmath2 , the ratio of @xmath215 and @xmath216 is given in eq.([add - df-1 ] ) .",
    "this equation indicates that the contribution from lower orbital angular momentum is larger than that from higher orbital angular momentum in the massive case .",
    "however , two contributions are exactly same in the massless limit .",
    "the ratio of @xmath170 and the low - energy absorption cross section for s - wave massive scalar turns out to be dependent on the number of extra dimensions as @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we can reproduce the ratio factor @xmath5 at @xmath6 which was shown by unruh in ref.@xcite .",
    "of course , our result has a correct massless limit .    for the case of the bulk",
    "scalar our result ( [ optical ] ) for the low - energy absorption cross section is shown to have correct massless and @xmath7 limits .",
    "especially , the cross section for the massless s - wave is exactly same with the area of the horizon hypersurface , which is a higher - dimensional generalization of the universality for s - wave .",
    "the extensions of our paper can be pursued in the several different directions .",
    "firstly , one may consider the low - energy absorption cross section for a massive particle which has an arbitrary spin . in this case",
    "we should derive a radial master equation using the newman - penrose formalism .",
    "then , it may be possible to examine the effect of spin in the absorption and emission problems of the higher - dimensional theories .",
    "similar approach can be applied to generalize ref.@xcite .",
    "then we may understand the effect of particle s mass in the stringy description of black hole .",
    "since the matching method between the near - horizon and asymptotic solutions introduced in ref.@xcite gives an information on the high - energy absorption cross section , it may be possible to extend our paper to the extremely high - energy domain .",
    "it is of interest to check the effect of the extra dimensions in the high - energy absorption and emission problems .",
    "another extension of the present paper is to examine the absorption and emission problems in the entire range of energy .",
    "this can be performed numerically by following our recent paper @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the absorption cross section for massive s - wave in the @xmath7 black hole background exhibits a pecular behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ decreasing behavior with increasing energy in the extremely low - energy regime .",
    "this behavior , as a result , breaks the universality for s - wave .",
    "it is interesting to check whether or not similar behavior exists in the higher - dimensional theories .",
    "the most interesting one seems to be to understand the physical origin of the ratio factor @xmath31 .",
    "since the absorption cross section for the brane - localized massless s - wave is fixed at @xmath217 , this ratio factor indicates that the absorption cross section for the dirac fermion increases when the extra dimensions exist .",
    "especially , for the infinite extra dimensions the cross section for fermion becomes maximum , twice the cross section for scalar .",
    "thus this ratio factor can be important to determine the number of the extra dimensions in the future collider .",

    "we will show in this appendix that the expression of the asymptotic solution in terms of the coulomb wave functions is impossible when extra dimensions exist .    for the proof it is convenient to rewrite eq.([radial1 ] ) as @xmath218 \\frac{d r}{d r } + \\left [ \\frac{\\omega^2}{h^2 } - \\frac{1}{h }        \\left\\{m^2 + \\frac{\\ell ( \\ell + 1)}{r^2 } \\right\\ } \\right ] r = 0.\\ ] ] using the fact that the first two terms in eq.([appen1 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath219 we can rewrite eq.([appen1 ] ) in the following form ; @xmath220         + \\frac{\\omega^2}{h^2 } - \\frac{1}{h } \\left(m^2 + \\frac{\\ell ( \\ell + 1 ) }                                                             { r^2 } \\right ) \\right\\ } \\right ] ( \\sqrt{h } r r ) = 0.\\ ] ]    now , let s taking @xmath62 limit in eq.([appen2 ] ) .",
