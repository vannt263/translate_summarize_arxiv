    "dijet rapidity - gap events , identified by very low hadron multiplicity in the rapidity region between two jets produced at high momentum transfer , have been observed both at fermilab @xcite and desy @xcite .",
    "we refer in particular to the experimental papers of the cdf and d0 collaborations @xcite , where an excess of opposite - side dijet events with respect to a background of same - side events is reported in the inclusive process @xmath2 , for low hadron multiplicity in the central region of the calorimeter detector .",
    "this phenomenon has been originally predicted from the exchange of two or more hard gluons in a color - singlet configuration , so that color recombination between nearly opposite moving particles , and consequent interjet hadronization , is avoided @xcite .    in our analysis of the problem @xcite",
    ", we consider energy flow instead of particle multiplicity . in these terms , we first identify a dijet rapidity - gap cross section and , using pqcd , write it in a factorized form that enables us to compute the evolution towards long distances of the possible color components exchanged in the partonic hard scattering .",
    "such evolution is due to soft , but still perturbative , interactions between the active partons . in our analysis , gaps turn out to have a more complicated structure than just color singlet exchange @xcite .",
    "the numerical results we obtain from our cross section closely resemble the qualitative behavior of the experimental data of ref .",
    "in terms of the ( pseudo)rapidity variable @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the polar angle , we identify by the condition @xmath5 the forward and backward regions of the calorimeter , where the two jets are to be found , with transverse energies above the experimental threshold @xmath6 ( see fig .  1 of ref",

    "we define @xmath7 the amount of energy flowing into the symmetric central region , of width @xmath8 .    the inclusive dijet cross section for all events with energy in the central region equal to @xmath7 can be written in the factorized form : & & ( s , e_t , y ) = _ f_a , f_b = u , d d + & & _ 0 ^ 1 dx_a _ 0 ^ 1 dx_b _ f_a / p(x_a,- ) _",
