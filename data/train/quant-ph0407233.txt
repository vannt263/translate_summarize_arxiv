    "most experimental realizations of entanglement have been implemented with photons .",
    "although the individual polarization states of photons are easily controlled , and their quantum coherence can be preserved over many kilometers of an optical fiber @xcite , photons can not be stored for long times , and manipulations of collective entangled states present considerable difficulties even when photons are confined in the same cavity .",
    "the creation of long lived entangled pairs with atoms , on the other hand , is a relatively recent pursuit which may provide reliable quantum information storage .",

    "@xcite based on the proposal of cirac and zoller @xcite .",
    "however the pulse area technique is not robust with respect to the velocity of the atoms and the exact - resonance condition . recently",
    "a different scheme has been proposed @xcite to entangle two atoms using a tripod stirap technique in a four - level atom - cavity - laser system in which one of the pulses corresponds to the field of a cavity mode .",
    "manipulation of entanglement of two atoms in this scheme , however , requires to control a geometric phase via an integral of hamiltonian parameters over a closed path in parameter space which is difficult in experimental implementations .",
    "the generation of atom - photon entanglement has also been proposed in @xcite in a tripod - like laser - atom - cavity system which sustains two cavity modes .    in @xmath1-type systems ,",
    "fractional stirap ( f - stirap ) is a variation of stirap @xcite which allows the creation of any preselected coherent superposition of the two degenerate ground states @xcite . as in stirap , the stokes pulse linking the initially unpopulated states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , arrives before the pump pulse linking the initially populated state @xmath4 to the excited state @xmath2 , but unlike stirap where the stokes pulse vanishes first , here the two pulses vanish simultaneously while maintaining a constant finite ratio of amplitudes . the f - stirap has been shown to increase the coherence between the lower states of @xmath1-systems in nonlinear optics experiments @xcite .",
    "the advantage of stirap is the robustness of its control with respect to the precise tuning of pulse areas , pulse delay , pulse widths , pulse shapes , and detunings .",
    "since f - stirap requires a precise ratio of pulse endings , it is not as robust as stirap if two different pulses are used .",
    "however in specific circumstances where a laser of elliptic polarization can be used , f - stirap can be made as robust as stirap @xcite . in f - stirap as in stirap , if the evolution is adiabatic ( for instance with a slow transit of atoms across cw fields ) , the dynamics of the system follows an adiabatic dark state which does not involve the excited atomic state latexmath:[$%    consequences of atomic spontaneous emission .",
