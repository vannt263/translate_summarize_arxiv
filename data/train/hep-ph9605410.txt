    "<S> introduction.*recently we have obtained the new formulae for the coulomb wave function correction for charged hadron pairs  @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> we have applied them ( in @xcite ) to data on @xmath0 correlation obtained in @xmath6 reaction at 70 gev / c  @xcite ( which were originally corrected by usual gamow factor only ) . however , as it was pointed out to us by one of the author of @xcite , we did not take into account their published finite momentum resolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our formulae can not be applied directly to experimental data in which such momentum resolution is accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in the present letter we would like to extend our method for the coulomb wave correction provided in @xcite to include also the momentum resolution case and to re - analyse data of @xcite and also to analyse the new , preliminary data of @xcite obtained with two kinds of thickness of ta target : 8 microns ( 8 mkm ) and 1.4 microns ( 1.4 mkm ) . </S>",
    "<S> + in the next paragraph we first reconstruct ( for the sake of completeness ) the analysis performed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and then , in the third paragraph , we propose our new method for the coulomb wave correction including this time also the momentum resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the final part contains our concluding remarks . </S>",
    "<S> + * 2 . reconstruction of the analysis of @xmath0 correlation data performed by using the gamow factor with momentum resolution.*it has been stressed in  @xcite that relative momenta of @xmath0 pairs observed by them have some finite resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged correlation function , defined as @xmath7 depends therefore on this momentum resolution , where @xmath8 stands for non - coulomb correlation factor . to account for it </S>",
    "<S> the following random number method has been proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in order to obtain the corresponding averaged quantities in analysis of the correlation data . </S>",
    "<S> + first of all , the relative momentum of the measured pair , @xmath9 , is decomposed into its longitudinal and transverse components : @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , by making use of the uniform random number @xmath12 ( it is worthwhile to notice at this point that the transverse components @xmath11 in data of @xcite are smaller than @xmath13 mev / c ) . </S>",
    "<S> one uses the following scheme here : @xmath14    at the next step , the gaussian random numbers for @xmath10 and @xmath11 are generated in the following way : @xmath15 in the above equations @xmath16 stands for the standard gaussian random number ] ] whereas @xmath17 and @xmath18 are longitudinal and transverse setup resolutions for the corresponding components , which are equal to ( values used in  @xcite ) : @xmath19 mev / c ; @xmath20 mev / c ( for target of the thickness @xmath4 mkm ) and @xmath21 mev / c ( for the 1.4 mkm target ) . + finally , using the randomized number @xmath22 one calculates the corresponding randomized gamow factor correction : @xmath23 where @xmath24 . the full flow chart for this procedure is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 . calculating now the average value of @xmath25 in 100 k events one can estimate the gamow factor with this finite momentum resolution , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is understood ( or , rather , implicitly assumed ) that essentially all unlike sign pions one deals with here originate from decays of long lived particles like @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2 shows the results of analysis of new data ( for 8 mkm target )  @xcite for region @xmath31 mev / c using this method . </S>",
    "<S> + * 3 . </S>",
    "<S> proposal of the new method.*we would like to propose now a new method of coulomb wave function correction with a source function @xmath32 instead of the gamow factor , in order to analyse the same data . as usual </S>",
    "<S> we decompose the wave function of unlike charged bosons with momenta @xmath33 and @xmath34 into the wave function of the center - of - mass system ( c.m . ) with total momentum @xmath35 and the inner wave function with relative momentum @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to express coulomb wave function @xmath37 in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath38  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and the parameter @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming factorization in the source functions , @xmath42 ( here @xmath43 ) , we obtain the expression for coulomb correction for the system of @xmath0 pairs identical ( modulo the sign ) as in  @xcite : @xmath44\\ : ,    \\label{eqn : a8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 for the specific choice of gaussian source distribution , @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 whereas exponential source function , @xmath48 , leads to @xmath49 using now the same method of gaussian random numbers as in the previous paragraph , we can analyse the old and the new data on @xmath0 pairs  @xcite using the following formula : @xmath50 figs .  </S>",

    "<S> authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have analysed their @xmath0 correlation data using gamow factor for coulomb corrections together with the random numbers method to account for final momentum resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we have repeated this analysis replacing gamow factor by the coulomb wave function but following the same method for correction for the momentum resolution effect ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : a8 ] ) ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained the following ranges of interaction for the gaussian source function : @xmath52 to get a correct physical picture of the source size , we should calculate the root mean squared size , which is equal to : @xmath53 the present study of @xmath0 pair correlations has shown therefore that one can estimate the interaction region even from the @xmath0 correlation data . </S>",
    "<S> it can be compared with the size of the ta nucleus , which is given by : @xmath54 as one can see , @xmath55 is significantly bigger than @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this difference to a physical picture shown in fig .  5 , i.e. , to the fact that unlike - sign pions are mostly ( if not totally ) emerging from the long - lived resonances shown there . </S>",
    "<S> ( in a future one should consider also a possibility of more direct estimation of the parameter @xmath27 and its role in determining the source size parameter correlation data , a similar function @xmath57 is introduced : @xmath58\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the degree of coherence and an exchange function due to the bose - einstein effect . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 is attributed the resonances effect ; @xmath61 depends on the monte carlo programs  @xcite . ] ) . + for completeness we have also tried to analyse the same data using exponential source function instead of gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> as is shown in table  [ tbl : a2 ] this leads to errors on @xmath62 of the order of @xmath63% , i.e. , with this type of source function we can not estimate the source size ( therefore it has to be discarded ) . + </S>",
