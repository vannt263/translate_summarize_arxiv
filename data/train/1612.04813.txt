    "the effects of galaxy cluster mergers on star formation ( sf ) have begun to be better understood in recent years , adding depth to the relationships found in relaxed clusters between sf and clustercentric distance and local density ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter c14 ; @xcite ; and many others ) . while some studies find no relationship between cluster merger activity and sf in specific clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite recently showed that supercluster morphology is important in shaping the properties of galaxies : higher levels of sf are found in galaxies in spider - type superclusters than filament - type superclusters .",
    "simulations by @xcite suggest that the quenching of sf in clusters depends on the geometry of the large - scale surrounding structure .",
    "this supports observational work by @xcite : spider - type superclusters have richer inner structure and larger numbers of filaments connecting galaxy clusters than do filament - type superclusters .",
    "however , a definitive relationship between supercluster environment and sf has yet to be shown .",

    "finally , we introduce our use of principal component analysis ( pca ) in determining relationships between sf , substructure , and large - scale environment .",

    ", @xcite identified 77,858 groups and clusters using the friends - of - friends ( fof ) method @xcite .",

    "as the sdss data are flux - limited , the fof method potentially suffers from the bias of fainter galaxies vanishing as distance increases .",
    "this leads to differences in the luminosities of member galaxies between nearby and more distant groups . @xcite",
    "partly corrected for this effect by determining a relationship between distance and the linking length used in their fof algorithm , and then applying this relation when selecting groups at different distances .",
    "they note that , by applying this correction , their final group catalogue is quite homogeneous in richness , size , and velocity dispersion , regardless of distance .",
    "however , we note that this does not correct for the fact that groups of a given richness at lower redshift are less luminous than those of the same richness at higher redshift .",
    "this is because , spectroscopically , fainter galaxies are more easily detected in the sdss  and thus included as group members  at lower redshift than higher redshift . despite this bias , in ",

    "this effectively removes any effect of cluster mass on our @xmath0 measurements .",
    "first , we calculate each cluster s @xmath40 and determine the normalized distribution of these cluster masses .",
    "next , for each bin of d8 , we weight the bin s @xmath40 values so their normalized distribution matches that of our entire sample .",
    "each cluster is assigned the weight of its @xmath40 bin . finally , we apply these weights to the galaxies in our linear regression analysis .",
    "we find that the slope of our relation actually becomes slightly more negative , decreasing to @xmath41 , when controlling for cluster mass .",
    "furthermore , the significance of the correlation increases slightly to @xmath42 .",
    "this suggests that a relation between large - scale density and cluster mass is not the cause of the observed correlation between sf and d8 .",

    "we also examine @xmath0 in clusters in spider and filament superclusters at high densities ( rows 4 and 6 of table  [ tab : sffracstab ] , respectively ) . the value of @xmath0 in spider superclusters with @xmath45 , @xmath5 , is higher than that in filament superclusters with @xmath45 , @xmath6 , with greater than 99% confidence .",
    "this difference is apparent in figure  [ fig : sfvsd8morphfig ] . in low density outskirts ( rows 3 and 5 of table  [ tab : sffracstab ] ) , there is no difference in @xmath0 between clusters in spider and filament superclusters .",
    "the specifics of the fof algorithm used by @xcite introduces a complication into our analysis .",
    "as the fof algorithm builds a given cluster , the higher density of galaxies within superclusters makes it easier for the algorithm to include galaxies at larger cluster radii .",
    "since galaxies on the outskirts of clusters typically exhibit more sf , this could artificially enhance cluster @xmath0 values at higher supercluster densities .",
    "we test for this possibility in two ways :    1 .",
    "we first measure @xmath0 against the ratio of virial radius ( @xmath46 , derived as the projected harmonic mean radius by @xcite ) to @xmath11 , serving as a proxy for a measurement of cluster radius based solely on cluster mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "clusters with high @xmath46 for their mass - derived radii ( via @xmath11 ) could have enhanced values of @xmath0 due to galaxies in outskirts included by the fof algorithm .",
    "we find no correlation between these quantities .",
    "2 .   second , we measure @xmath0 against the surface density of cluster galaxies ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "clusters with lower surface densities may be artificially expanded by the fof algorithm , including galaxies in outskirts with higher sf and thus exhibiting enhanced values of @xmath0 .",
    "again , we find no correlation between these quantities .",
    "we perform these tests not only with @xmath11 as a proxy for cluster radius and mass , but also with @xmath12 and @xmath40 .",
    "the results of the tests suggest that any extended tails of galaxies included in clusters due to the fof algorithm are not artificially enhancing cluster @xmath0 .",
    "all of these results suggest that 1 ) there is a significant inverse correlation between @xmath0 and d8 , dominated by clusters in filament superclusters ; and 2 ) in high - density cores of superclusters , spider superclusters exhibit higher values of @xmath0 than filament superclusters .",

    "[ sec : pcadatasec ] , we use pca to determine any correlations between cluster @xmath0 , amount of cluster substructure , density of supercluster environment , and total cluster mass .",
    "we use two measurements of amount of substructure from : number of components ; and the results from the @xmath24 test , which in this case is the negative of @xmath76 .",

    "our pca results are consistent whether we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath40 as a proxy for total cluster mass .",
    "furthermore , our results remain the same whether we use @xmath52 or number of components as a measure of amount of substructure .",
    "thus , we present and discuss only the results when using @xmath11 and @xmath52 . table  [ tab : pcatab ] displays the results of our analysis .",
    "it shows the values of the four pcs for our four variables ; and the standard deviation , proportion of variance , and cumulative proportion for these pcs .",
    "the cumulative proportion shows that the first two pcs account for 83% of the variance in these cluster properties , with each pc being equally important .",
    "thus , we will focus primarily on the first two pcs .",
    "the pc1 values of d8 and @xmath11 are close in magnitude and of the same sign , confirming the correlation between these two variables .",
    "since the value of @xmath0 is of opposite sign , this suggests that @xmath0 is weakly anti - correlated with d8 and @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the pc2 value of d8  also of opposite sign to @xmath0  is approximately four times larger than that of @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that d8 rather than @xmath11 is more strongly related to @xmath0 .",
    "this agrees with our analysis in ",
    "[ sec : pairwisesec ] , where we confirm that differences in @xmath40 ( i.e. , cluster _",
    "r_-band luminosity ) are not the cause of the observed correlation between @xmath0 and d8 .",
    "the pc2 values of @xmath0 and amount of substructure are of similar magnitude and of the same sign , confirming the direct correlation between these variables found in . while the pc1 values of these variables are of opposite sign , the correlation suggested by the pc2 values is more robust : the values of these variables along pc2 are closer in magnitude to each other than those along pc1 ; and the d8 and @xmath11 values along pc2 are much lower than those along pc1 .",
    "these values , compared to the others discussed , suggest that @xmath0 is probably most strongly related to amount of substructure than the other variables discussed .",
    "finally , the pc1 values of d8 and amount of substructure suggest a direct correlation between these variables , which agrees with the findings in ( though they admit that this correlation is weak ) .",
    "furthermore , pc1 also shows that amount of substructure is also correlated with @xmath11 .",
    "intuitively , this is expected : a richer cluster will have a higher luminosity and more opportunity for substructure to be detectable .",
    "this effect does act counter to the main result of this paper  the inverse correlation between d8 and @xmath0  and the result of  the direct correlation between substructure and @xmath0 ( see figures 5 and 6 in that paper ) .",
    "in other words , as d8 and luminosity increase , the results from this paper and suggest that @xmath0 ( and thus amount of substructure ) should decrease , not increase .",
    "this , however , bolsters the correlation we find between d8 and @xmath0  it must be significant enough to counter the weak correlation between d8 and amount of substructure .",
    "we find a significant inverse correlation between the density of supercluster environment and the amount of sf within galaxy clusters . while this could in principle be an indirect result of a correlation between supercluster density and cluster substructure",
    ", we find this not to be the case .",
    "rather , both cluster substructure and supercluster environment are independently related to a cluster s sf , and , while these effects oppose each other , the influence of cluster substructure appears stronger than that of supercluster environment .",
    "these results are not simply due to the correlation between d8 and cluster mass , luminosity , or richness .",
    "we also find that supercluster morphology is important in affecting cluster sf : the relation between supercluster density and sf is observed only in filament rather than spider superclusters . furthermore , sf in spider superclusters is higher at high densities compared to filament superclusters .",
    "when we consider these differences between filament and spider superclusters , from the complexity of effects explained above emerges a coherent picture .",
    "spider superclusters have richer inner structure , and are dynamically younger , than filament superclusters .",
    "we expect to find more sf in dynamically younger systems , and we indeed see this in the high - density cores of spider superclusters .    in galaxy clusters , more structure indicates a less relaxed , younger system ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "such clusters are more likely to live in superclusters with richer inner structure where group mergers occur more easily than in superclusters with simple inner structure .",
    "thus , combining our results from this work with those of , we can explain in more detail the effects of cluster substructure and supercluster environment on sf .",
    "as clusters form hierarchically from smaller groups , the dynamically younger systems exhibit more sf , since the sf in these systems has had less time to be quenched by various gravitational and hydrodynamical processes ( see @xcite for a review of such mechanisms ) .",
    "thus , it is more likely to find high sf in clusters that find themselves in the high - density environments of spider superclusters than filament superclusters .",
    "additionally , this shows that high - density cores of superclusters are a special environment for clusters .",
    "for instance , they may be collapsing @xcite , possibly affecting the properties of galaxy clusters and their galaxy populations .",
    "this interesting result of our study emphasizes the role of supercluster morphology in shaping the properties of galaxies and groups / clusters in them .    the main result of this work agrees with @xcite , who found that more elliptical galaxies are found in the higher - density environments of superclusters than at lower densities .",
    "furthermore , @xcite used the galaxy spectra parameter @xmath77 to show that galaxies in groups in superclusters are systematically _ older _ than those in lower - density environments .",
    "they found that this result holds even though the groups themselves have higher velocity dispersions and are therefore dynamically _ younger _ than groups elsewhere .",
    "these results agree well with the interpretation from this work explained above .",
    "we note that @xcite found no correlation between the mean stellar ages of superclusters and the shape parameter of superclusters .",
    "this is not in conflict with our results , since we used information about the inner structure of superclusters to divide them into two morphological classes , while @xcite only used the shape parameter to characterize the outer shape of superclusters .",
    "@xcite showed , in agreement with @xcite , that galaxy content of superclusters depends only weakly on the overall shape of superclusters .    our results , while significant , still exhibit substantial scatter .",
    "this owes to the complicated dynamics affecting cluster @xmath0 , many aspects of which are discussed here .",
    "one variable we have not taken into account is the stage of formation of a cluster or supercluster .",
    "studies have shown that clusters with similar degrees of apparent substructure can exhibit different @xmath0 measurements due to different stages of cluster merger activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we analyze the relationship between star formation ( sf ) , substructure , and supercluster environment in a sample of 107 nearby galaxy clusters using data from the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> previous works have investigated the relationships between sf and cluster substructure , and cluster substructure and supercluster environment , but definitive conclusions relating all three of these variables has remained elusive . </S>",
    "<S> we find an inverse relationship between cluster sf fraction ( @xmath0 ) and supercluster environment density , calculated using the galaxy luminosity density field at a smoothing length of 8 @xmath1 mpc ( d8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of @xmath0 vs. d8 is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 of clusters located in low - density large - scale environments , @xmath3 , is higher than for clusters located in high - density supercluster cores , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also divide superclusters , according to their morphology , into filament- and spider - type systems . the inverse relationship between cluster @xmath0 and large - scale density </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by filament- rather than spider - type superclusters . in high - density cores of superclusters , </S>",
    "<S> we find a higher @xmath0 in spider - type superclusters , @xmath5 , than in filament - type superclusters , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> using principal component analysis , we confirm these results and the direct correlation between cluster substructure and sf . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that cluster sf is affected by both the dynamical age of the cluster ( younger systems exhibit higher amounts of sf ) ; the large - scale density of the supercluster environment ( high - density core regions exhibit lower amounts of sf ) ; and supercluster morphology ( spider - type superclusters exhibit higher amounts of sf at high densities ) . </S>"
