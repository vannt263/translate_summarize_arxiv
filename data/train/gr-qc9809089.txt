    "we learned that the holes response to external perturbations appears as special modes of gravitational waves  the quasi normal ringing modes .",
    "numerical simulations confirm that perturbed black holes settle down by the emission of these modes@xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence for astrophysical black holes@xcite which are perturbed by their environment .",
    "there are also several open issues that have been presented as conjectures : the cosmic censorship conjecture@xcite , the hoop conjecture @xcite , the no - hair conjecture @xcite , the topological censorship conjecture @xcite and the adiabatic invariant conjecture @xcite .",
    "others have been studied in connection with thermodynamics , statistical mechanics , quantum theory and cosmology @xcite .",
    "also examples of more general black holes has been studied in the context of supergravity , string theory and related theories @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study some aspects of accelerated black holes .",
    "an interesting feature of these holes is that from a semi - classical view point both hawking and unruh radiation may be present because of the horizons associated to the holes and to the acceleration .",
    "the object of our study is an old exact solution of vacuum einstein equations found in 1917 by levi - civit @xcite and weyl @xcite .",
    "it is a simple and rich geometry . in the seventies",
    ", it was found a broader class of exact solution with acceleration and rotation parameters @xcite @xcite and it was named as c - metric or weyl c - metric .",
    "the solutions were obtained by studying the algebraic properties of special class of geometries . in the eighties , it was known to belong to a general class of boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes@xcite@xcite .",
    "these solutions have also charged versions @xcite @xcite .",
    "the charged c - metric is interpreted as the solution for einstein - maxwell equations for a charged particle moving with uniform acceleration @xcite .",
    "another possible interpretation is the spacetime of two schwarzschild - type particles joined by a spring moving with uniform acceleration @xcite .",
    "actually , the c - metric can be associated to several spacetimes @xcite .",
    "we review them , in section 2 , using a slightly different approach .",
    "the most interesting ones have two event horizons and a point singularity .",
    "one event horizon has finite area , associated to a black hole and the other event horizon has infinite area , associated to the rindler horizon of accelerated frames @xcite .",
    "we compute the surface gravity on these horizons and conclude that , in general , the gravity at the hole is larger than the frame acceleration .",
    "we show also , for generic configurations , that the hole s horizons are not smooth compact surfaces and confirm the well known fact that the line of acceleration is not elementary flat .",
    "we remark that the product of surface gravity by the area of the horizon gives exactly the expected mass of the hole .",
    "this result is expected because of the coordinate transformation that map the c - metric into a weyl solution which is a superposition of a hole , with a given mass , and a semi - infinite rod of linear density @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "our units are such that @xmath2 .",
    "finally we notice that the c - metric solution brings no limitation on the acceleration of a black hole .",
    "the usual presentation of the solution has the constraint @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mass and the acceleration parameters .",
    "we show that this constraint is due sole to the choice of coordinates .    in section 3 the rotating c - metric",
    "is studied in a similar way .",
    "the main new features introduced by a rotation parameter is that it opens the possibility of existence of ergoregions , spinning strings and spinning struts .",
    "we extend most of the results of the previous section to include a rotation .",
    "the interpretation of the more significant parts of the rotating c - metric is that of a spacetime in the neighborhood of an accelerated kerr - like particle @xcite .",
    "we show also that the internal singularity resembles a rotating ring as in the standard kerr solution .",
    "the amount of gravitational radiation by accelerated black hole is not computed in these paper @xcite . as stationary solutions both c and the rotating c metric represent eternal black holes being eternally accelerated with gravitational wave coming from the singularities at infinity in a such amount to balance the output of the accelerated black holes .    in the last section",

    "see the appendix for the connection between the rotating c metric and the lewis - papapetrou coordinates for vacuum stationary axisymmetric spacetimes .",
    "the c metric can represent several spacetimes depending on the range of the coordinates .",
    "as shown in the table i , the spacetimes have singularities , event horizons and conical singularities along the axis .",
    "if one takes appropriate combinations of the rectangles in the table i , one gets one of the interpretations found in the literature by some coordinate transformation .    by studying the geometrical quantities of the c metric we find the correct interpretation for the spacetime it generates independently of a particular transformation of coordinates .",

    "it requires a fine tuning of the constants to get a smooth compact horizon . in general the axis of symmetry",
    "is not elementary flat .",
    "the surface gravity at the holes are stronger than the frame acceleration .",
    "therefore the accelerated black hole temperature is higher than the temperature of the thermal bath associated to the accelerated frame .",

    "we found no mathematical limitation on the acceleration parameter .",
    "for the rotating case the mass has the contribution of the rotation and the acceleration , as it should .    although the solutions have some bizarre features , they give us lots of informations on how the spacetime is dragged along an accelerated black hole .",
    "the extension of uniqueness theorems to include accelerating black holes is investigated in @xcite    * acknowledgments *    we want to thank fapesp for financial support , also psl is grateful to cnpq for a research grant and to g. gibbons for some early conversations about different aspects for the c - metric .",
