    "moreover , with increasing shear rate a marked shear thinning sets in where the relative viscosity @xmath5 ( @xmath6 : viscosity of solvent ) is lowered considerably .",
    "these general features are also observed for solutions of soft colloidal particles as e.g. a solution of star polymers in a suitable solvent [ helgeson _ et al . _",

    "suspensions of hard spheres or of particles characterized by a sufficiently steep mutual repulsion may hence be treated as the most simple model system for the rheological study of the flow behavior of colloidal systems .    by now",
    ", it is well understood that the dynamics of quiescent suspensions of hard spheres can be understood and modeled quantitatively in terms of the mode - coupling theory [ van megen and pusey ( 1991 ) , van megen and underwood ( 1994 ) ] .",
    "mode - coupling theory [ gtze and sjgren ( 1992 ) ] was shown to explain quantitatively the structural arrest that takes place in colloidal dispersions above the volume fraction @xmath7 . moreover",

    "here it has been demonstrated that the strong upturn of @xmath9 occurs much below the volume fraction of 0.63 that would refer to random close packing of the spheres .",
    "first theoretical calculations of @xmath9 within the frame of mct fully supported this view [ banchio _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) ] .",
    "fuchs and cates ( 2002 , 2003 ) recently demonstrated that mct can be generalized to treat the dynamics of colloidal suspension in shear flow .",
    "they developed the integrations throught transients ( itt ) approach , which describes the competition between enforced deformation or flow and intrinsic structural relaxation .",
    "thus , mct can be used to model the distortion of the structure of suspensions by a flow field at finite shear rate @xmath3 .",
    "one central point of this theory is the melting of the glass by shear : flow leads to a glass - to - fluid transition in the suspension and a unique stationary state can be reached again despite the fact that the volume fractions of the particles in the suspension are above @xmath8 .",
    "it is presumed that this holds as long as local free volume is available below random close packing .",
    "flow curves giving the relative viscosity @xmath5 as function of shear rate are predicted to present well - defined states that are independent of the previous history of the sample .",

    "the pnipam shell of these particles swells when immersed in cold water ( below 32@xmath10c ) .",

    "the advantage of these systems over the classical hard sphere systems are obvious : dense suspensions can be generated _ in situ _ without shear and mechanical deformation .",
    "moreover , all previous history of the sample can be erased by raising the temperature and thus lowering the volume fraction to the fluid regime .",

    "however , a problem that restricted this comparison was crystallization due to the narrow size distribution of the particles .",
    "crystallization presents a major obstacle since the rate of nucleation is rather fast for volume fractions even far below the volume fraction @xmath8 of glass transition ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the crystalline phase could be removed by shear melting and the fluid state could be super - cooled for a given time . the time window of nucleation , however , limited the experimental studies to frequencies and/or shear rates not too small [ crassous _ et al . _",
    "( 2006a , 2008a ) ] . a fully conclusive comparison of mct with experimental data ,",

    "we present a full comparison of theory and experiment using a thermosensitive suspension having a slightly broader size distribution that prevents crystallization .",
    "hence , all measurements can now be extended to very low shear rates or frequencies that may take hours without any disturbance by crystallization .",
    "it will be demonstrated that mct provides indeed a full description of the rheological behavior of suspension under homogeneous flow .",
    "special attention will be paid to shear banding [ callaghan ( 2008 ) , dhont and briels ( 2008 ) , manneville ( 2008 ) , olmsted ( 2008 ) ] and other effects that may come into play for concentrated suspensions [ isa _ et al . _",

    "a brief conclusion will sum up the main findings .",
    "the central points and main predictions of mct and its generalization to flowing dispersions in the integration through transients ( itt ) approach have recently been discussed in detail [ crassous _ et al . _",
    "( 2008a ) ] .",
    "hence , it will suffice to discuss the points that will be used in the analysis of the experiments .",
    "structural relaxation , which is the central topic of mct , leads to internal relaxation processes with an intrinsic relaxation time @xmath13 that far exceeds the dilute limit brownian diffusion time .",
    "the itt - mct approach to sheared fluids considers the effect of shear when the dressed peclet or weissenberg number @xmath14 becomes appreciable , while the bare peclet number @xmath15 formed with the solvent viscosity @xmath16 and the hydrodynamic particle radius @xmath17 should be much lower than unity for the approach to hold .",
    "the main point of the mct of quiescent dispersions is the slowing down of the dynamics at the glass transition .",
    "critical values for the particle concentration , the temperature or other thermodynamic control variables exist , where a glass transition separates fluid from yielding glassy states . in fluid states ,",
    "a first newtonian region is reached if the shear rate or the frequency is low enough ; the newtonian viscosity @xmath18 is finite .",
    "non - newtonian flow , that is shear thinning , is observed at higher shear rates corresponding to a finite weissenberg number pe @xmath19 .",
    "mct recovers maxwell s relation @xmath20 , so that the criterion @xmath21 translates into @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ( zero - frequency ) shear modulus at the glass transition . for glassy states at higher densities or interaction parameters ,",
    "newtonian flow is not observed anymore but the shear stress @xmath24 is predicted to approach a plateau value for sufficiently low shear rates @xmath3 ; a dynamic yield stress follows @xmath25 .",
    "it corresponds to an infinite newtonian viscosity .    a central point of mct",
    "as applied to flowing suspensions [ fuchs and cates ( 2002 ) ] is shear melting : finite shear rates will lead to a melting of the glass into a fluid . as a consequence of this , flow curves given by the shear stress @xmath24 as function of the shear rate @xmath3 present well - defined states for a given volume fraction even above the glass transition .",
    "hence , @xmath2 is independent of the previous history of the sample , under the condition that the stationary long time limit has been achieved .",
    "previous experimental studies strongly suggest that this central prediction of theory is found indeed [ crassous _ et al . _",

    "schematic @xmath26-model _ [ fuchs and cates ( 2003 ) ] brownian motion of the particles is captured in terms of a density correlator @xmath27 which is normalized / initiated according to @xmath28 .",
    "mct relates this correlation to the memory function @xmath29 by a memory equation @xmath30 the parameter @xmath31 describes the microscopic dynamics of the density correlator and will depend on structural and _ hydrodynamic _ correlations .",

    "an explicit time dependence of the couplings in @xmath29 captures the accelerated loss of memory by shear advection [ fuchs and cates ( 2002 , 2003 , 2008 ) ] .",
    "shearing causes the dynamics to decay for long times , because fluctuations are advected to smaller wavelengths where small scale brownian motion relaxes them .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 sets the scale for the accumulated strain @xmath41 to matter .",

    "the specific choice of this transition point is motivated by @xmath53 its repeated use in the literature , and @xmath54 because it predicts a divergence of the viscosity at the glass transition , whose power is close to the one of the microscopic mct calculation for short ranged repulsions : @xmath55 within microscopic mct for hard spheres using the percus - yevick structure factor @xmath56 was found [ gtze and sjgren ( 1992 ) ] .",
