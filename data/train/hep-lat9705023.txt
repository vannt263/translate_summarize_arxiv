    "when fermions are discretized on a d - dimensional lattice they `` double '' producing @xmath0 species for each flavor . in order to remove the unwanted degrees of freedom special care",
    "must be taken . for a vector theory , like qcd",
    ", two methods have been used to deal with this problem , but both break the global symmetries of the continuum theory .",
    "wilson fermions @xcite are implemented by adding an irrelevant operator to the action .",
    "this operator makes all but one of the species heavy ( with masses close to the cutoff ) . for the @xmath1 flavor qcd",
    "this operator breaks the @xmath2 chiral symmetry down to @xmath3 .",
    "this explicit breaking is severe and requires fine tuning of the bare quark mass in order to obtain a massless theory .",
    "even then the size of the breaking is proportional to the lattice spacing and only close to the continuum limit the explicit breaking becomes small .",
    "staggered fermions @xcite break the @xmath2 chiral symmetry down to @xmath4 . because of the remnant of chiral symmetry the massless theory can be reached by simply taking the bare quark mass to zero .",
    "however , the flavor symmetry of the theory has been compromised and is also only recovered as the continuum limit is approached .    despite these problems",
    "both methods have been very successful in describing the light hadron spectrum at zero temperature . however , both methods have difficulties in studying the finite temperature phase transition .",
    "wilson fermions have a complicated phase diagram that , at the presently accessible lattice spacings , makes it hard to extract the relevant physics .",
    "staggered fermions , because of the exact remnant of chiral symmetry , do not suffer from this problem .",
    "however , at the presently accessible lattice spacings , the breaking of flavor symmetry makes two of the three pions heavy .",
    "this can have important physical consequences since the transition temperature is of the order of the pion mass . for a review on the finite temperature phase transition with both types of fermions the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite and references therein .",
    "a few years ago a new method for discretizing fermions was developed in order to address the more difficult problems associated with chiral gauge theories @xcite . in the following years",
    "this method was further developed ( see @xcite and references therein ) with important progress in the development of chiral gauge theories @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the basic idea follows from the fact that a massive vector theory in @xmath5 dimensions , with a mass term that changes sign along the @xmath5 dimension , develops a massless chiral zero mode that is exponentially bound along the @xmath5 direction to the region where the mass changes sign . from the point of view of the @xmath6 dimensional world",
    "this is a chiral fermion .",
    "this region is called domain wall and this type of fermion is called domain wall fermion ( dwf ) .",
    "when such a theory is discretized species doubling also occurs .",
    "however , since the @xmath5 dimensional theory is vector - like the extra species can be removed with the addition of a standard wilson term .",
    "the resulting theory has a single chiral fermion exponentially bound to the wall .",
    "if , for practical reasons , the @xmath5 dimension is made finite with periodic boundary conditions for the mass then the mass must change sign one more time . in that region ( anti - wall ) an exponentially bound chiral zero mode with opposite",
    "chirality appears . as a result ,",
    "the theory becomes vector - like .",
    "different types of boundary conditions yield similar problems . in order to preserve the single chiral mode",
    ", the @xmath5 dimension must be kept infinite . at first sight",
    "this may seem impractical .",
    "however , narayanan and neuberger developed a method , called the overlap formalism , that makes it possible to deal with this infinity @xcite .",
    "the overlap formalism develops a transfer matrix along the @xmath5 dimension and an associated hamiltonian .",
    "the gauge fields are defined only on the @xmath6 dimensional space and are taken to be independent of the @xmath5 coordinate @xcite .",
    "in essence , the extra dimension is treated as a complicated flavor space .",
    "the resulting formalism involves two hamiltonians , one for the region of positive mass and one for the region of negative mass .",
    "the chiral determinant is the determinant of the overlap of the two ground states associated with each hamiltonian and it can be calculated explicitly once all the negative eigenvectors of both hamiltonians are known . for a finite @xmath6 dimensional",
    "lattice the hamiltonians are finite size matrices of size @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath6 dimensional volume and their eigenvectors can be readily calculated .",
    "the resulting chiral determinant has the correct magnitude and a phase that exhibits the correct gauge dependence for `` smooth '' gauge fields . for `` rough '' gauge fileds",
    "the phase exhibits a mild breaking of gauge symmetry even for anomaly free theories .",
    "this problem has been resolved in @xcite .",
    "these methods can also be used to formulate a vector theory . in this case",
    "the boundary conditions along the @xmath5 dimension are set to be periodic .",
    "a dirac fermion emerges with the positive chirality component bound on the wall and the negative chirality bound on the anti - wall .",
    "if the @xmath5 dimension is taken to be infinite the two chiralities are decoupled and the resulting theory has intact chiral symmetries ! again , this infinity can be dealt with the overlap formalism and now there are no issues associated with the phase of the determinant since , for a vector theory , the determinant is real . therefore , the overlap formalism provides an ideal lattice regularization of vector theories where the chiral symmetries are left intact even for finite lattice spacing .",
    "also , the anomalous breaking of the axial symmetry is reproduced in an elegant way along with a formula for the index of the chiral dirac operator @xcite .",
    "the overlap formalism was used in a dynamical numerical simulation of the massless single and multiflavor schwinger model with good results @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of qcd using the overlap formalism would clearly be very appealing .",
    "however , as mentioned above , such a simulation would require the calculation of all negative eigenvectors of matrices of size @xmath7 .",
    "this makes such a calculation prohibitive for present generation supercomputers .",
    "an obvious alternative ( see @xcite and references therein ) is to keep the @xmath5 dimension finite and use standard hybrid monte carlo type algorithms to simulate the theory in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "of course , the exact chiral symmetry will be spoiled but it will be recovered as the size @xmath9 of the @xmath5 dimension is sent to infinity .",
    "therefore , even at finite lattice spacing one can control the restoration of the regularization induced chiral symmetry breaking by using the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this involves no fine tuning and , furthermore , since the two chiralities decay exponentially away from the wall ( anti - wall ) , one would expect that the restoration of chiral symmetry would be exponential i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the computer cost of such a simulation would be @xmath9 times larger than a simulation of standard wilson fermions with the same physical masses . since for present day supercomputers a value of @xmath9 greater than @xmath12 will make simulations impractical , an important question to ask is what is the rate `` @xmath13 '' of restoration of chiral symmetry and how does it depend on the other parameters of the theory and in particular on the lattice spacing . in @xcite , @xcite some of the issues relating to this question were investigated analytically . numerical work in @xcite , @xcite",
    ", @xcite has yielded encouraging results and in particular the interesting work of @xcite indicates that dwf can successfully address problems related to the evaluation of weak matrix elements .",
    "however , these works have only marginally addressed this particular question .",
    "before full scale dynamical qcd simulations are performed this question should be answered . in this paper",
    "this question is investigated in the context of the two flavor lattice schwinger model .    a useful variation of the wall , anti - wall model studied in @xcite was proposed in the context of vector lattice gauge theory in @xcite , @xcite . there , instead of having a mass that changes sign in two places along the @xmath5 dimension ( say at @xmath14 and @xmath15 )",
    ", the mass is kept fixed to some positive value @xmath16 , but the boundary conditions are taken to be free at the ends of the @xmath5 dimension .",
    "again , two zero modes with opposite chiralities emerge , but they are now bound at the opposite ends of the @xmath5 dimension and are separated by a distance @xmath9 rather than @xmath15 as in the original model . therefore",
    ", the expectation is that for the same @xmath9 this model will achieve better restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "another feature added in this model is the introduction of an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term that connects the two ends with strength @xmath17 .",
    "this gives mass to the fermion in addition to the one resulting because of the finite extend @xmath9 .",
    "the reason for adding this term is that it provides linear control over the fermion mass instead of the exponential one provided by @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , in a numerical computation , it makes much more sense to vary @xmath17 rather than @xmath9 in order to control the mass .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath17 one would like to keep @xmath9 large enough so that it does not affect the fermion mass in any significant way .",
    "this method and the associated overlap formalism will be used throughout this paper .",
    "the theory has five parameters .",
    "the first two are the lattice spacing @xmath18 and the physical extent @xmath19 along one direction of the @xmath6 dimensional box ( they are controlled by the pure gauge coupling @xmath20 and the size in lattice units @xmath21 ) .",
    "the remaining three parameters @xmath16 , @xmath9 and @xmath17 all control , to some extent , the amount of chiral symmetry breaking and therefore the effective fermion mass .",
    "for @xmath22 the theory is chirally symmetric except for the explicit breaking introduced by @xmath17 . as a result",
    ", the effective fermion mass vanishes linearly with vanishing @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "but for finite @xmath9 this is not the case . as mentioned above , even for @xmath23 the restoration of chiral symmetry",
    "is expected to be exponential @xmath10 .",
    "one would expect that the exact continuum solution of the schwinger model would be useful to compare with results obtained on the lattice .",
    "unfortunately , this is only partially true .",
    "the regularization with dwf introduces to the two dimensional action a four - fermi term with some coefficient .",
    "since , for the two dimensional model , this operator is not irrelevant , the continuum theory will be different from a continuum theory with no four - fermi term .",
    "although the continuum theory has been solved with such a term present @xcite , the results can not be directly compared since the value of the coefficient arising from the dwf has not been calculated .",
    "this problem was encountered in @xcite and @xcite and made the comparison with continuum results complicated .",
    "fortunately , for the purposes of this work , the continuum results are not needed .",
    "in fact , there is a much more relevant comparison that can be made . at every step the value of any observable at finite @xmath9",
    "can be directly compared with its value at infinite @xmath9 calculated using the overlap on the same lattice size and lattice spacing .",

    "[ sec - observables ] the definitions of the various observables used in this paper are given .",
    "in section [ sec - free ] the free theory for finite @xmath9 is discussed , the full expression for the propagator is given and the `` effective '' bare fermion mass is identified . in section [ sec - interact ]",

    "the doubler species to be removed one must set @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "however , this range is further restricted by the requirement that the transfer matrix along the @xmath5 direction be positive @xcite : @xmath46 the gamma matrices are taken in the chiral basis and are the same as in the last reference in @xcite . in two dimensions they are : @xmath47 the pv action is designed to cancel the contribution of the heavy fermions in the large @xmath9 limit .",
    "this is necessary because the number of heavy fermions is @xmath48 and at the @xmath49 limit they produce bulk type infinities @xcite .",
    "there is some flexibility in the definition of the pv action since different actions could have the same @xmath50 limit .",

    "the number of steps is set to @xmath313 depending on the size of @xmath9 .",
    "this is necessary because , for @xmath23 , trajectories that cross between different topological sectors experience large hmc fermion forces ( for more details see section [ sec - hmc - topology ] ) .",
    "the conjugate gradient residual is set to @xmath314 .",
    "typically , the number of conjugate gradient iterations is around @xmath312 and does not exceed @xmath315 for @xmath23 and @xmath194 .",
    "the number of measurements is @xmath316 except for the more `` expensive '' @xmath317 , @xmath318 lattices where @xmath319 measurements were performed .      in this",
    "section problems related to the sampling of non zero topological sectors with the hmc algorithm at small fermion masses are discussed .",
    "the hmc algorithm is very successful provided the fermion mass does not become very small . if the fermion mass becomes very small then the effects of topology are not reproduced correctly .",
    "in particular , the measurement of @xmath287 becomes problematic .",
    "if , for some fixed volume , the fermion mass is made very small then similar analysis as in @xcite indicates that the effect of the zero modes coming from different topological sectors becomes important .",
    "in particular , as can be seen from the overlap implementation @xcite , @xcite , at finite physical volume , at zero mass and in the @xmath22 limit , the operator @xmath288 receives contributions only from sectors @xmath203 , while the fermion boltzman weight ( fermion determinant ) is not zero only in sector 0 . as @xmath17 is turned on ( and/or @xmath9 is decreased from infinity )",
    "the fermionic determinant becomes non zero in sectors other than @xmath14 and the operator @xmath288 receives contributions from sectors other than @xmath211 . because of this behavior at small fermion mass the hmc algorithm will mostly sample the sector @xmath14 where the observable @xmath288 receives small contributions .",
    "the algorithm will infrequently visit the sectors @xmath203 , but when it does the observable @xmath288 will receive large contributions to `` make up '' for the small sampling rate . as a result , when the fermion mass is decreased a larger number of hmc iterations will be needed to sample the @xmath203 sectors correctly . therefore , for a fixed amount of computer time ,",
    "if the fermion mass becomes very small the important contributions may not even be sampled at all and as a result not only the expectation value of @xmath288 will be underestimated but also the associated error .",
    "this type of difficulty has already been noticed in simulations of the schwinger model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the problem described above leaves a clear signature in the time history of @xmath288 . in figure",
    "@xmath231 the time history of @xmath288 is given for six different fermion masses at @xmath194 .",
    "as the fermion mass is decreased , the average around which @xmath288 fluctuates decreases .",
    "this decrease is compensated by the large contributions received from the @xmath233 sectors .",
    "these contributions start to appear as `` spikes '' in the time history . the smaller the fermion mass the larger the `` height '' of the spikes but since the corresponding boltzman weight becomes smaller their frequency also decreases . notice the different scale of the @xmath320 and @xmath321 graphs .",
    "but it is not only @xmath287 that is affected at small fermion masses . if , along an hmc trajectory , the topological charge changes then the fermion determinant changes by a large amount . as a result",
    ", the hmc fermion force becomes large and the hmc step size errors become large .",
    "therefore , as the fermion mass is made smaller one must adjust the hmc step size accordingly .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that these difficulties are not related to dwf but rather to the hmc algorithm . in particular , the simulations using the overlap in section [ sec - overlap - sim ] do not suffer from these problems since there the fermion determinant is treated as an observable in a pure gauge heat bath .      in this section a strict test of chiral symmetry restoration",
    "is done .",
    "a full dynamical simulation using the hmc algorithm is performed with the explicit fermion mass @xmath17 set to zero so that the only breaking of chiral symmetry comes from the finite extent @xmath9 .",
    "the restoration rate at fixed physical volume and various lattice spacings is studied by measuring @xmath221 for various values of @xmath9 .",
    "although this provides a strict test one must keep in mind that the non - zero topological sectors may be suppressed more than they should for the reasons mentioned in section [ sec - hmc - topology ] .",
    "this means that the rate of restoration of chiral symmetry observed here is mainly due to effects that occur in the zero topological sector and its vicinity .",
    "the following results were obtained at fixed @xmath250 .    in figure @xmath323 , @xmath292 is plotted in a `` log '' plot vs. @xmath9 at fixed physical volume @xmath192 and for various lattice spacings @xmath324 where @xmath325 corresponding to the lines from top to bottom .",
    "data for @xmath326 , @xmath327 are statistically indistinguishable from the @xmath328 data and are not plotted .",
    "for @xmath329 the decay is consistent with exponential with a rate that becomes faster as the lattice spacing decreases .",
    "for @xmath330 the decay is again consistent with exponential but with a slower rate .",
    "again , this rate becomes faster as the lattice spacing decreases .",
    "also , the percent change of the rate at @xmath191 is @xmath331 but at @xmath332 is @xmath333 .",
    "the fits shown are two parameter fits to @xmath334 .",
    "the @xmath299 per degree of freedom is smaller than one for all the fits except for the @xmath332 , @xmath335 data that have a @xmath299 per degree of freedom of @xmath336 .",
    "the exponentiated rate @xmath337 of the various fits vs. @xmath338 is shown in figure @xmath339 .",
    "the diamonds correspond to the @xmath340 fits while the crosses to the @xmath341 fits .",
    "one can see that @xmath337 is roughly a linear function of @xmath338 for the @xmath342 fits and for @xmath343 . however , more data at smaller lattice spacings are needed before one can be confident that scaling has set in and that this is the correct scaling form .",
    "although the above fits are all consistent with exponential decay , power law decay of the form @xmath344 can be excluded with some confidence only for the fast decay , @xmath335 , at the smallest lattice spacing , @xmath332 . a power law fit to this data has @xmath299 per degree of freedom of @xmath345 .",
    "more statistics and larger @xmath9 will be needed in order to clearly establish the type of decay for the other cases .",
    "for example , at the largest lattice spacing , @xmath191 , it is estimated that the error bars will have to be reduced from their few percent size down by a factor of about ten .",
    "alternatively , the error bars can be kept at the few percent level but then it is estimated that @xmath9 will have to be made as large as @xmath346 . both approaches are beyond the purpose of this paper and the available computer resources .    the facts that the decay changes for @xmath347 , that the slower decay approaches the faster one as the continuum limit is approached and that both decays become faster as the continuum limit is approached can all be understood from the analysis in sections [ sec - topology ] and [ sec - fluctuations ] .",
    "finally , the t hooft vertex @xmath287 was also measured but , as expected from the discussion in section [ sec - hmc - topology ] , its value and associated error is underestimated .",
    "in particular , its value is much lower than the corresponding overlap value of section [ sec - overlap - sim ] .",
    "for this reason that data is uninteresting and is not presented here .      in this section",
    "the @xmath102 case is studied . since",
    "typical qcd simulations are done for non zero fermion mass the results of this section are of practical interest .",
    "dynamical simulations are performed with masses @xmath17 large enough , @xmath349 , so that the effects of topological sectors @xmath350 are not miscalculated due to problems associated with the hmc algorithm as described in section [ sec - hmc - topology ] .",
    "both @xmath221 and @xmath287 are measured and their approach to the @xmath206 limit is studied and compared with the @xmath121 results of section [ sec - overlap - sim ] .",
    "this is done for fixed physical volume , and various lattice spacings .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is kept fixed at @xmath351 .    in figure",
    "@xmath352 @xmath353 ^ 3 $ ] is plotted vs. @xmath9 for @xmath354 at fixed physical volume and lattice spacing , @xmath192 , @xmath191 . according to the results in section [ sec - overlap - sim ]",
    "one expects that @xmath355 ^ 3 \\sim m_{\\rm eff}$ ] .",

    "in these figures the cross is the coefficient a and the dotted lines are the @xmath359 result of figure @xmath293 plus / minus the error .",
    "one can see that as @xmath17 becomes larger the @xmath359 result is approached faster .",
    "this is in accordance with naive expectations born out from the free theory formula for @xmath360 eq .",
    "[ meff_free ] . in figure",

    "one can see that the @xmath121 result has already been approached at @xmath364 .",
    "the effects of changing the lattice spacing at @xmath365 can be seen in figures @xmath366 and @xmath367 . in figure",
    "@xmath366 @xmath368 ^ 3 $ ] is plotted vs. @xmath9 at fixed physical volume @xmath369 for different lattice spacings @xmath324 , @xmath370 .",
    "the fits are again to a form @xmath363 and have a @xmath299 per degree of freedom of @xmath358 .",
    "one can see a similar behavior as the one in section [ sec - hmc - mf - zero ] . as the lattice spacing",
    "is reduced the rate @xmath13 of the exponential approach to the @xmath121 result increases .",
    "for example , @xmath221 at the larger lattice spacing @xmath326 decays with @xmath371 but at the smaller lattice spacing @xmath372 it decays faster with @xmath373 .",
    "however , one should note that for @xmath374 and @xmath372 the rate saturates and is essentially dictated by the @xmath375 points with the @xmath364 point very close to the @xmath121 result . if a second slower rate sets in for @xmath376 it is unimportant and is lost in the statistical noise .",
    "some insight to this behavior can be gained from the analysis at the end of section [ sec - topology ] ( in particular see figure @xmath238 ) .",
    "similar behavior is observed in figure @xmath367 for @xmath377 .",
    "all fits have @xmath299 per degree of freedom @xmath378 .    similar results are obtained if one keeps the physical volume and @xmath17 in physical units fixed while changing the lattice spacing .",
    "this can be seen in figures @xmath379 and @xmath380 by comparing the @xmath372 , @xmath365 data ( diamonds ) with data at @xmath326 , @xmath381 ( squares ) . in these graphs",
    "the physical volume is fixed at @xmath382 , and @xmath17 in physical units is fixed at @xmath383 . again",
    "the decay rate increases as the lattice spacing is reduced .",
    "@xmath221 at the larger lattice spacing @xmath326 decays with @xmath384 but at the smaller lattice spacing @xmath372 decays faster with @xmath373 .",
    "all fits have @xmath299 per degree of freedom @xmath358 .    finally , it should be noted that although the above data is consistent with exponential decay , other types of decay can not be excluded .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that since the @xmath121 result has already being approached , within statistics , for @xmath385 , the decay is basically dictated only by the two points @xmath386 .",
    "more statistics are needed in order to clearly establish the type of decay .",
    "in this paper the properties of domain wall fermions ( dwf ) were studied in the context of the two flavor lattice schwinger model .",
    "the expectation value of the chiral condensate @xmath221 was used to probe issues related to restoration of the regularization induced chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the expectation value of the relevant t hooft vertex @xmath287 was used to probe issues related to topology .",
    "dynamical numerical simulations of the full theory were performed .",
    "it was found that , as expected from perturbative considerations , the restoration of chiral symmetry as a function of @xmath9 ( @xmath9 is the size in lattice units of the @xmath5 direction ) at a fixed physical volume and lattice spacing , is consistent with exponential decay . in particular , the data is consistent with a picture where chiral symmetry is restored with a fast exponential decay rate for @xmath9 up to some value and with a slower exponential decay rate for @xmath9 above that value . for the range of lattice spacings used in this paper the inflection appeared at @xmath387 . using a simple model it was found that the first fast decay can be associated with restoration of chiral symmetry in the zero topological sector while the second slower decay can be associated with the regions of gauge field configuration space that connect the @xmath180 and @xmath233 topological sectors .",
    "the effects of the size of the lattice spacing @xmath18 to the two decays were studied using both analytical arguments and explicit numerical simulations of the full theory .",
    "it was found that for zero explicit fermion mass the fast decay associated with the zero topological sector becomes faster as the lattice spacing is decreased .",
    "the vanishing of the chiral condensate is consistent with a form @xmath388 with @xmath337 being roughly a linear function of @xmath18 , but more data at smaller lattice spacings are needed before one can be confident that scaling has set in and that this is the correct scaling form . the second slower decay also becomes faster as the lattice spacing is decreased and it differs less from the faster decay as the lattice spacing becomes smaller .",
    "for the smallest lattice spacing studied the two exponential decay rates differed by @xmath389 .    for small but non zero explicit fermion mass @xmath17 the values of @xmath221 and @xmath287 were measured .",
    "the corresponding @xmath206 numbers were calculated by performing numerical simulations with the overlap formalism .",
    "it was found that the @xmath177 numbers were also approached in a way that is consistent with exponential decay with a rate that became faster as the lattice spacing decreased .",
    "furthermore , the larger the fermion mass the sooner the @xmath177 value was approached and for the fermion masses studied in this paper the @xmath177 result was already achieved to within a few percent for @xmath390 .",
    "if a second slower decay does set in for @xmath376 , it is unimportant and was lost in the statistical noise .",
    "finally , an interesting result was obtained from the measurements of @xmath221 and @xmath287 vs. @xmath17 .",
    "it was found that these measurements are in agreement with the analytical predictions of @xcite .",
    "in particular the interesting @xmath391 behavior was reproduced .",
    "although all the numerical data are consistent with exponential decay , power law decay can be excluded only for the fast decay at the smallest lattice spacing studied .",
    "for that data the decay is sufficiently fast and the error bars are sufficiently small so that a power law fit can be safely excluded since it has a @xmath299 per degree of freedom @xmath392 .",
    "more statistics and larger @xmath9 are needed in order to be able to clearly distinguish between exponential and power law decay for the rest of the data points .",
    "the next step is to carry out a similar investigation for dynamical qcd .",
    "many of the characteristics of dwf found here are sufficiently generic so that one would expect that they will also be present in qcd .",
    "if it turns out that qcd at the presently accessible lattice spacings , volumes and quark masses has similar restoration rates as the ones found here , then dwf will indeed provide a powerful fermion discretization method .",
