    "when observing young stellar objects , x - ray detection fraction depends primarily on sensitivity , spectral source hardness , and the degree of intervening obscuration toward the source .",
    "our results further illustrate that , in the case of ysos characterized by strong variability , the number and/or duration of observation epochs plays a significant role in detection statistics when compared to studies with similar sensitivity .",
    "the x - ray detection fractions as a function of time in table [ yso_fov ] and figure [ yso_frac ] provide insight into the variable nature of ysos .",
    "class 0/i ysos have the lowest overall detection fraction in all bands .",

    "the detection fractions for class ii sources are slightly larger than for class 0/i sources ; furthermore , it appears that for several observations , class ii sources are more readily detected in the soft band than in the hard band .",

    "class iii ysos , whose x - ray detection fraction in a given observation is 1.0 by definition , are consistently more detectable in the soft band than the hard band , indicating lower levels of intervening absorption with respect to the other yso classes .",

    "this comparison of x - ray luminosity sensitivities is only approximate , given the different source detection thresholds and angular size scales used in the three studies .",
    "when comparing yso detection fraction , it may be important to consider not only the total exposure time and source distances , but also how the component exposures were distributed in time .",
    "fp07 used eight exposures of the coronet cluster over the course of @xmath05 years ; however , five of the exposures were obtained only a day apart .",
    "the serpens core ( w07 ) was observed for one 90 ks period .",
    "l1630 was observed 11 times over the course of four years with only two sets of two exposures obtained less than 2.5 months apart ( table [ chan_obsid ] ) .    for class",
    "0/i ysos , fp07 and w07 found detection fractions of 90% and 41% in r cra and serpens , respectively , whereas for l1630 we obtain a class 0/i detection fraction of only 26% .",
    "the class ii detection fraction for l1630 ( 58% ) is significantly larger than the detection fraction for class ii ysos in the serpens cloud ( 32% ) but again smaller than in the coronet cluster ( 82% ) .",
    "it appears the high detection fraction in r cra can most likely be attributed to the less deeply embedded nature of its class 0/i ysos and the high sensitivity of the r cra observations . if class ii ysos were characterized by relatively steady x - ray emission over timescales longer than a typical x - ray observation , punctuated by relatively rare , strong outbursts , then the probability of detecting x - ray emitting class ii ysos should increase with the number of x - ray observations .",
    "it would therefore appear that , for studies with similar sensitivities  as for w07 s serpens study and our l1630 study  observations spanning longer time scales may yield a higher x - ray detection fraction of class ii sources .      both coronal activity and star - disk interactions ",
    "e.g. , magnetically - funneled accretion , time - variable absorption from inner disk warps and/or accretion streams , disk instabilities resulting in accretion outbursts , or magnetically confined - plasma suddenly released in star - disk magnetic - reconnection events  are phenomena that can plausibly cause significant x - ray variability . in the case of star - disk interactions , obviously , a circumstellar disk must be present .",
    "class iii ysos have little or no detectable ir excesses and hence their disks have likely already dispersed .",
    "ergo , if star - disk interactions are are at least partially responsible for the highly x - ray variable nature in observed ysos with disks , then class i , class ii , and transition disk sources should show x - ray variability that is distinct from that of class iii sources . in particular ysos with disks might be expected to display larger levels of variability than class iii ysos over a timespan of several years and multiple observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "transition disk ysos , representative of an evolutionary stage between class ii and class iii , are characterized by disks with large ( @xmath01 - 10 a.u . )",
    "inner dust clearings @xcite .",
    "if magnetic field lines interacting with gas in the disk are required to provide some mechanism for variability , then transition disks whose `` holes '' are large enough might extend beyond the immediate influence of the protostellar magnetic field , thus halting such variability .",
    "however , even though there is a large gap in the dusty component of a transition disk , this does not necessarily imply a large gap in the gaseous component @xcite , and hence star - disk interactions could still be an important driver of yso x - ray variability .",
    "regardless of the mechanisms underlying variability , figures [ lc_1 ] , [ lc_2 ] , [ lc_3 ] and [ lc_4 ] show that each class in our variability sample has at least one yso that underwent an order of magnitude increase in count rate over the @xmath04 year course of our study .",
    "several ysos also showed significant variability on timescales of days , which is suggestive of magnetic loop flaring @xcite .",
    "fp07 displayed similar x - ray duration light curves for ysos in the coronet cluster and suggested that these light curves indicated that class i ysos displayed stronger levels of variability than class ii ysos .",
    "likewise , figures [ lc_1 ] , [ lc_2 ] and [ xray_var ] suggest that l1630 class 0/i ysos are more variable than class ii ysos , though these figures also suggest that class 0/i and class iii objects are similarly variable .",

    "<S> we have detected cool ( @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 ) plasma , possibly indicative of accretion shocks , in three classical t tauri stars . </S>",
    "<S> a subsample of 27 x - ray - emitting ysos were covered by 9 of the 11 chandra observations targeting v1647 ori and vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> for these 27 ysos , we have constructed x - ray light curves spanning approximately four years . </S>",
    "<S> these light curves highlight the variable nature of pre - main sequence x - ray emitting young stars ; many of the l1630 ysos vary by orders of magnitude in count rate between observations . we discuss possible scenarios to explain apparent trends between various x - ray spectral properties , x - ray variance and yso classification . </S>"
