    "+ to be more precise , the removal of the element @xmath444 allows the opposite classes @xmath445 and @xmath446 to be joined into one without breaking the weak hyperbolicity condition .",
    "therefore @xmath77 has fewer such classes and @xmath447 , which gives a generator of @xmath448 , does not give anything in @xmath449 because there _ it is not a union of classes _ ( it lacks the elements of @xmath446 to be so ) .",

    "as shown above , these two classes are represented by embedded spheres in @xmath69 with trivial normal bundle built from the cells @xmath452 and @xmath453 by reflection , where @xmath454            the corresponding spheres are obtained by reflecting in the hyperplanes corresponding to elements in @xmath461 and @xmath462 , respectively . since these sets are disjoint , the spheres also intersect in a single point .",
