    "<S> bp 34 , f-91898 orsay cedex    the talk is based on recent studies [ 1,2 ] motivated by the increasing awareness in the community of the role of an @xmath1 linear collider ( lc ) for a precise determination of the susy parameters which are needed to interpret the dark matter ( dm ) content of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> after the wmap results [ 3 ] leading to an accuracy at the @xmath4 level or @xmath5 in two standard deviation range and awaiting for the planck mission in @xmath6 which aims at @xmath7 , it seems appropriate to check that a lc can do its job properly on this essential topic .    in the susy scenario with @xmath3-parity conservation , </S>",
    "<S> the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is the lightest neutralino @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this particle is considered as the best candidate to satisfy the cosmological constraints on dm in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> dm constraints have been recently re - examined [ 4 ] within the msugra scenario , confronting the precise predictions obtained after the wmap results . </S>",
    "<S> these data imply , for many of the benchmark points retained , a very small difference between the mass of the lightest slepton ( @xmath0 ) , the susy partner of the @xmath9 , and the lsp mass ( @xmath10 ) since one of the preferred mechanism to regulate the amount of dm in the universe is the so - called ` co - annihilation mechanism ' .    </S>",
    "<S> previous studies have shown that the masses of both smuon and lsp can be precisely measured using the so - called end - point method [ 2 ] . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall thus concentrating on the measurement of stau mass , which is relevant as the amount of dm depends critically on it .    </S>",
    "<S> two methods are presented for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> the first is appropriate when the stau mass is comparable to the beam energy and the expected cross section of the stau production is small . the second works when the stau mass is significantly smaller than the beam energy and the stau production cross section is large . </S>",
    "<S> we also address detectability issues related to different collision mode either in head - on or with a half crossing angle of @xmath11mrad .    </S>",
    "<S> the end - point method could not applied to the stau analysis as there are additional missing energies arising from neutrinos in subsequent @xmath9 decays . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the final state particle is very soft , typically a few gev for @xmath12gev taking benchmark point @xmath13 in [ 4 ] as a working point . </S>",
    "<S> another difficulty comes from the fact that the signal cross section is often many orders of magnitude smaller than that of the standard model ( sm ) processes .    for point @xmath13 at center - of - mass energy ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath15gev , </S>",
    "<S> the cross section of the signal process @xmath16 is around @xmath11fb , which is to be compared with @xmath17fb of the dominant sm background processes @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectator @xmath20 in the background process is however predominantly peaked in the forward direction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore an efficient tagging down to lowest possible angle is crucial in rejecting these background events . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative studies show that the current tagging efficiency of the beam monitor calorimeter , lcal , does not allow for a background free analysis . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis may be achieved [ 1 ] when the lcal is fully efficient in tagging all spectator @xmath20 having a transverse momentum above @xmath21gev and when additional discriminating variables are used . </S>",
    "<S> one such variable is the scalar sum of transverse momentum with respect to the thrust axis in the plane transverse to the beam directions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting signal efficiency and background contribution from the dominant processes in the head - on collision are summarized in table  [ tab : effevtd ] .    </S>",
    "<S> .__the efficiency , the signal and dominant background events in the head - on case for benchmark point d@xmath22 at @xmath23gev . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the program micromegas [ 5 ] has been used to compute the relative uncertainty on the dm density due to the susy mass error measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this program operates without any assumption , in particular it does not rely on the msugra scheme . </S>",
    "<S> results listed in table  [ tab : results ] show , as expected , that @xmath24 depends primarily on the precision on the stau and lsp masses . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis , optimized for the d@xmath22 solution , gives satisfactory results except for point j@xmath22 which is almost beyond detectability .    </S>",
    "<S> the second method works at higher beam energies but still below the mass thresholds of other sparticles , the idea being at such large energies , the signal cross section is big enough to collect a large event sample . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis also benefits from using explicitly the polarized beams to enhance the signal over background ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the stau mass can then be determined by analyzing the high energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> indeed for the same benchmark point @xmath13 , if @xmath14 could be chosen to be at @xmath25gev , sufficiently higher than the stau mass , a more precise stau mass and therefore dm density could be achieved even with a moderately small integrated luminosity of @xmath26pb@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the same method has also been applied to a sps1a inspired model for three different @xmath28 values . again </S>",
    "<S> the precision on the stau mass and dm density improves as @xmath28 increases .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , our studies have shown that the detection and the mass measurement of the tau slepton , potentially important in view of the cosmological implications , is challenging in the so - called `` co - annihilation '' scenario . </S>",
    "<S> a forward veto to remove the @xmath29 background down to very small angles is essential to reach an almost background free result , adequate to achieve the accuracy implied by the post - wmap results in a model independent analysis .    in our analysis with method one </S>",
    "<S> , we have assumed an ideal detector for particle detection but with realistic detector acceptance as expected from a fast simulation program sgv [ 6 ] , developed and tested at lep . </S>",
    "<S> some of the detector capabilities are not yet fully explored , e.g. , the @xmath30 information of the tracking device and possible different decay lengths ( secondary vertex distributions ) between the signal and the background events . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis in terms of the signal and background separation may still be improved using more sophisticated likelihood methods instead of simple cuts .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the stau analysis in collisions with a crossing angle is likely to be more difficult ( thought still feasible ) than in head - on collision , only possible in the tesla scheme . in a warm machine like nlc </S>",
    "<S> , the same conclusion could be reached provided that there is no degradation due to pile - up of several bunches in the forward veto ( this may require some r@xmath31d for a very fast calorimeter ) . </S>"
