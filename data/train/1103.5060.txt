    "several papers address the question of global fixed points for abelian groups . of note is recent work of franks , handel , and parwani @xcite .",
    "they prove , using very different methods from those we employ in this paper , that any finitely generated abelian group of orientation - preserving @xmath12 diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 leaving invariant a compact set has a global fixed point .",
    "franks and others have also studied the fixed point sets of @xmath8-actions by measure - preserving homeomorphisms .",
    "much of this work focuses on measure - preserving homeomorphisms of surfaces , but since the universal cover of any closed , oriented surface of genus @xmath13 is the plane , it is intimately related with the study of fixed points of homeomorphisms of the plane .",
    "theorem [ thm ] here could be viewed as a first step towards generalizing these results to groups other than @xmath8 .",
    "our main theorem concerns the existence of global fixed points of an arbitrary group @xmath0 acting on the plane by orientation - preserving homeomorphisms , without making assumptions on the algebraic structure of @xmath0 . of course , some restriction on the group action is necessary to ensure a global fixed point , for we must exclude group elements acting ( for example ) by translations . to rule out such examples , we require that the group have _ uniformly bounded orbits _ on a bounded set of sufficient size .",
    "we also require a nonwandering hypothesis to eliminate more pathological counterexamples .",
    "what is surprising is that these two conditions suffice :    [ thm ] let @xmath0 be any group acting on @xmath1 by orientation - preserving homeomorphisms .",
    "suppose that there exists a constant @xmath14 and a ball @xmath15 of radius @xmath3 such that for all @xmath6 and @xmath16 we have @xmath17 .",

    "the condition that no point in the wandering set for @xmath20 has forward orbit contained in @xmath18 or a bounded component of @xmath19 is true in particular if @xmath0 is a group of measure preserving transformations ( for any locally finite measure with full support ) , or if @xmath0 has _ uniformly bounded contraction _ on @xmath18 , meaning that there is some @xmath24 so that @xmath25 for any @xmath26 and @xmath11 .",

    "since @xmath30 contains @xmath18 , there must be at least one .",
    "if there is more than one , then let @xmath61 denote a spanning interval such that the unbounded component of @xmath71 contains another spanning interval .",
    "in particular , this implies that there is an arc @xmath68 of points _ in the interior of _ @xmath30 contained in the unbounded component of @xmath71 that is also a spanning arc .",
