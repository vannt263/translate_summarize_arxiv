    "building a practical quantum information processor has attracted considerable interest during the past decade @xcite . with the resources provided by quantum mechanics , such as superposition and entanglement ,",
    "a quantum computer could achieve a significant speedup for certain computational tasks .",
    "the most prominent example is shor s factoring algorithm @xcite , which allows an exponential speedup over the known classical algorithms .",
    "the proposed quantum algorithms are constructed assuming that all quantum operations can be performed precisely . in reality ,",
    "any physical realization of such a computing process must treat various errors arising from various noise and imperfections ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "physically , these errors can be distinguished into two different kinds : incoherent and coherent errors .",
    "the incoherent errors originate from the coupling of the quantum information processor to an uncontrollable external environment , which is stochastic , and results in decoherence .",
    "coherent errors usually arise from non - ideal quantum gates which lead to unitary but non - ideal temporal evolutions of a quantum computer .",
    "so far , most previous works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have been concerned with quantum errors arising from the decoherence due to interactions with the external environment and external operational imperfections . here , we focus instead on internal ones .",
    "the coherent errors we consider here are related to the _ intrinsic _ dynamical evolution of the qubits _ between _ operations .",
    "a quantum computing process generally consists of a sequence of quantum unitary operations .",
    "these transformations are usually applied to the superposition states so that the quantum computer evolves from an input initial state to the desired final state .",
    "if the two qubit levels have different energies , as it is usually the case , the superposition wave function of the quantum register undergoes fast coherent oscillations during the finite time delay between two consecutive operations .",
    "these oscillation , if not controlled , can spoil the correct computational results expected from the ideal quantum algorithms , where operational delays are neglected .    in principle",
    ", these coherent errors can be either ( 1 ) avoided by tuning the relevant energy splittings of the qubits to zero @xcite ; or ( 2 ) eliminated by introducing a  natural \" phase induced by using a stable continuous reference oscillation for each quantum transition in the computing process @xcite .",
    "experimentally , for example in nmr systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , these errors were usually corrected by introducing two additional operations before and after the delay to reverse each undesired free evolution .    in this paper",
    "we perform a quantitative assessment of the effects of the dynamical phases in shor s algorithm by realistically assuming that operational delays , between successive unitary transformations , exist throughout the computation .",
    "we explore a phase - matching approach to deal with the dynamical phase problem .",
    "we show that coherent `` errors '' due to these phases , acquired by the dynamical evolution of the superposed wavefunction during the operational delays , may be avoided by properly setting the _ total _ delay .",
    "we then carefully evaluate the robustness of such a phase - matching condition , focusing on its dependence on the number of qubits , the length of the delay , and the fluctuations in the qubit energy splitting .",
    "our discussions are in the context of shor s algorithm , but can be extended to other quantum algorithms , such as the phase estimation and other algorithms  @xcite . for simplicity and clarity , here",
    "we assume that the influence of the environmental decoherence and the gate imperfections on the computing process are negligible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present a decomposition of shor s algorithm and explain how we incorporate the dynamical phases into the realization of this algorithm .",
    "the usual decompositions of quantum algorithms into consecutive elementary gates are strictly limited by the short decoherence time . here ,",
    "we reconstruct the standard shor s algorithm out of four functional unitary transformations , and only consider the operational delays between these larger building blocks .",
    "we assume that each block can be exactly performed by only one - time evolution as a multi - qubit gate ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , avoiding the existing idle time inside it .",
    "it is shown that the effects of dynamical phases are not negligible , even in this primary or  coarse - grained \" decomposition . in section iii",
    ", we numerically evaluate several examples to illustrate the phase - matching condition , and establish a clear relationship between this condition and the equivalence of the schrdinger picture and the interaction picture description of a physical system .",
    "we also demonstrate the robustness of the phase - matching condition by varying the number of qubits involved , the delay duration , and distribution of qubit energy splitting .",
    "finally , in section iv we present some conclusions and discussions from our numerical studies .",
    "we study the dynamical phase problem in the context of shor s factoring algorithm . in shor",

    "note that only the delays from the initial hadamard gates to the finishing fourier transformation may result in physical effects .",
    "fortunately , all the operators during these delays are either diagonal or at least not affecting the phase accumulation .",
    "therefore , the phases in each qubit simply add up .    if each unitary transformation is itself composed of several consecutive steps , with delays between these internal steps , we assume these delays to be negligible .",
    "this condition implies that the internal time delays occurring between steps within each unitary operation should be so short that their accumulated phases are negligible .",
    "such a condition is possibly difficult to satisfy experimentally .",
    "however , our results below show that even under such a restrictive condition the interference effects due to dynamical phases between successive unitary transformation are already too significant to be ignored .    for the ideal situation without any delay ( @xmath72 ) , the probability distribution @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) reduces to that in the original shor s algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , eq .  ( 5 ) clearly shows that the expected probabilistic distribution may be strongly modified by the interferences due to the dynamical phases of the superposition wavefunction , which would consequently lead to a lower probability for obtaining the desired final output .",
    "in order to study the effects of dynamical phases , we need to compute @xmath69 .",
    "the probability @xmath69 in ( 5 ) can be computed if the energies @xmath73 for the various states @xmath74 involved are known exactly .",
    "these will be computed below .      as a first approximation",
    "we assume that all qubits in a quantum computer system possess identical energy spectra .",
    "such an approximation is valid for naturally identical systems like trapped ions . in this ideal case ,",
    "when all the qubits have the same energy splitting between ground and excited states , different quantum states with the same number of excited qubits will acquire the same dynamical phase .",
    "for example , the four - qubit states @xmath75 and @xmath76 would acquire the same dynamical phase @xmath77 during a delay time @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 are the energies of a single qubit corresponding to the ground state @xmath24 and the excited state @xmath81 , respectively . under this approximation ,",

    "obviously , when the _ total _ effective delay time @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) satisfies the phase - matching condition @xmath88 the above probability distribution @xmath69 reduces to that of an ideal computation process with @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that _ the interference due to the fast evolution of the dynamical phases can be suppressed periodically _ so that the correct results are obtained at the delay points indicated in ( [ eq - phase ] ) .",
    "physically , this phase matching condition is related to the transformation of wavefunction from the interaction to the schrdinger pictures .",
    "theoretical derivations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for realizing quantum computation are usually in the interaction picture , in which the hamiltonian for the qubit free - evolution does not appear , and the oscillation of the superposed wavefunction does not exist .",
    "more specifically , if a system hamiltonian @xmath90 can be written as a sum of a free oscillator part and an interaction part @xmath91 , so that the time - dependent schrdinger equation can be written as ( in the so - called schrdinger picture where operators are time - independent while states evolve with time ) @xmath92 , which satisfies @xmath93 where @xmath94 . now that @xmath95 has been eliminated from the schrdinger equation , it seems that dynamical phases due to the qubit free evolution would have no effect .",
    "however , at the end of a calculation , physical measurements have to be performed to read out the computational results , and these measurements are generally performed in the lab frame ( the schrdinger picture ) , in which the dynamical phases reappear .",
    "more specifically , the measurement of an observable @xmath96 can be expressed as @xmath97 . in other words , if we prefer calculating the expectation value of a time - independent operator , it has to be done in the schrdinger picture .",

    "these dynamical phases lead to fast oscillations in the total wavefunction , and modify the desired quantum interference required by quantum algorithms , which in turn reduce the probability of obtaining correct computational results .    here",
    "we have studied the effects of the dynamical phases in running a quantum algorithm ( more specifically , shor s factoring algorithm ) .",
    "we point out that a phase - matching condition can potentially help allieviate the interference problems caused by the dynamical phases , and this condition is closely related to establishing the equivalence between quantum states in the schrdinger picture and the interaction picture through a quantum computation process . in the presence of coherent phase errors , we have demonstrated that , the probability of obtaining the correct answer decreases exponentially with increasing number of qubits of the work register . in addition , shor s algorithm fails for the worst case scenario of @xmath184 if the expected order @xmath8 is a power of two .",
    "we have further shown that the phase - matching condition studied here is quite robust in the presence of small fluctuations in the qubit energy splittings . unlike the refocusing technique in nmr experiments @xcite , which deals with unwanted evolutions due to uncontrolled qubit interaction , we have shown here that by properly setting the _ total _ effective delay , the unwanted oscillations of the superposed wavefunctions due to the free hamiltonians of the bare qubits can be effectively suppressed , thus the desired output can be obtained without additional operations .",
    "this implies that the quantum computing may be performed in an effective interaction picture , in which coherent errors arising from the free evolution of the bare qubits during the operational delay can be automatically avoided .",
    "we emphasize that the present simplified approach only treats the delays between two sequential functional operations and neglects those inside these transforms .",
    "in fact , each functional transform , which is actually equivalent to a multi - qubit gate , can be , in principle , implemented exactly by using only one - time evolution @xcite .",
    "this  coarse - grained \" one - step implementation implies that the evolutions relating to the various parts of the total hamiltonian have been well controlled .",
    "therefore , the operational delays , relating only to the free evolution ruled by the free hamiltonian of the bare physical qubits , within each one of these larger functional building blocks are assumed to be zero .",
    "also , the dynamical phases acquired by the superposed wavefunctions can be added up for the operational delays before and after each functional transformation .",
    "therefore , the phase - matching condition ( 7 ) exists for the _ total _ delay .",
    "the present calculation is done assuming that shor s algorithm is accomplished in 5 lumped steps .",
    "a simple analysis can prove that , even if using an actual elementary gate array model , e.g. , shown in figure 7 ( for implementing the initializations by using the hadamard gates and the quantum fourier transformation ) ,     and @xmath185 refer to the operational delays inside them , respectively . in the logical basis ,",

    "the qubit is in a product state before the first non - diagonal @xmath189 gate , while the delays after the second non - diagonal @xmath189 in the corresponding hadamard gate do not affect the results of projective measurement ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "therefore , the dynamical phases acquired in different effective operational delays accumulate even when the operational delays inside the functional steps are considered .    in the present approach",
    ", we have assumed that every qubit in the work register has the same waiting time @xmath190 for each effective operational delay . in practice , this assumption is not necessary .",
    "indeed , in the elementary gate array model , the waiting times for different qubits would have been different .",
