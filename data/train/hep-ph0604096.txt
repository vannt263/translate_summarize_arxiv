    "for the last decades , a lot of articles have been devoted to trying to understand the underlying particle theory beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among them , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is conceived to be one of the most promising candidates for its brevity and various attractive features .",
    "a well - known example is the unification of sm gauge coupling constants at some high - energy scale  @xcite .",
    "the exploration of supersymmetric grand unified theory ( gut ) has been therefore one of the most important subjects in particle physics .",
    "in addition to the gauge coupling unification , the gut framework often leads to the unification of yukawa coupling constants .",
    "for example , in the minimal @xmath2 model@xcite , a right - handed down - type quark and a lepton doublet belong to a single quintuplet representation of @xmath2 group , and especially gives the bottom - tau yukawa unification at high - energy scale .",
    "it is found in the mssm that the bottom - tau unification is preferred in light of the experimentally measured values of the bottom quark and tau lepton masses .",
    "moreover the detailed numerical analyses of renormalization - group ( rg ) running of gauge and yukawa couplings have brought up a possibility of top - bottom - tau yukawa unification with a large ratio between two vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the mssm higgs doublets  @xcite . hence one is naturally led to the scenario where all matter fermions of one generation are unified in a single representation of gut group . the simplest candidate for such unified gauge group",
    "is @xmath0 where the sm fermions are included in 16-dimensional representations .",
    "various phenomenological studies of @xmath0-type yukawa unification have been performed in the literature  @xcite .    in the phenomenological study of yukawa unification ,",
    "one of the main subjects is the masses of third - generation fermions .",
    "it is known that the bottom quark mass is largely affected by low - energy threshold corrections which are induced via decoupling of superpartners of sm particles and bring a change of several tens of percents to the bottom quark mass estimation  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the corrections depends on low - energy values of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking parameters and supersymmetric higgs mass parameter .",
    "consequently the low - energy estimation of fermion masses also has strong dependence on the superparticle spectrum .",
    "it is argued from detailed analysis that the threshold correction to the bottom quark mass must be suppressed than its naively expected value so that the yukawa unification leads to the top , bottom , and tau masses within the experimentally allowed ranges  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the successful prediction of charged fermion masses , the recent experimental results for neutrino physics also seem to prefer the unified theory .",
    "an important property of neutrinos is their tiny mass scale compared to the other sm fermions , the smallness of which scale is naturally realized by introducing right - handed neutrinos and their large majorana masses , called the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos are unified into 16-dimensional representations of @xmath0 , combined with the other sm fermions .",
    "moreover the recent study of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite has revealed that there is large generation mixing in the lepton sector , while the corresponding mixing angles in the quark sector are known to be small .",
    "such contrastive generation structure between quarks and leptons is naively difficult to be obtained in unified theory , since as stated above the matter fermions are combined into gut multiplets . a way to ameliorate this problem",
    "is proposed in gut framework to naturally accommodate the large lepton mixing with asymmetric forms of yukawa matrices , the so - called lopsided forms  @xcite .    in gut models with the above - mentioned neutrino property , the rg evolution of coupling constants",
    "is expected to be altered from the naive top - bottom - tau yukawa unification by including the effects of neutrino couplings and/or the generation structure . assuming the seesaw mechanism and taking no account of lepton large mixing , the phenomenological study of neutrino yukawa effects on gauge and yukawa rg evolution has been performed , e.g.  in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the analysis has shown that the evaluation of gauge couplings and third - generation fermion masses is slightly changed ; for example , the prediction of top quark mass is made up to 3  gev  @xcite and the low - energy value of the strong gauge coupling constant is decreased by a few percents  @xcite .",
    "a relevance of leptonic generation mixing for the bottom - tau yukawa unification has also been discussed  @xcite .",
    "these rg studies however only deal with the gauge and yukawa coupling evolutions .",
    "as stated above , the low - energy threshold corrections to the bottom quark mass often play a significant role in the analysis of fermion masses .",
    "since the corrections are determined by superparticle mass spectrum , the inclusion of dimensionful parameters into the rg analysis is an important issue for a complete study of neutrino effects .    concerning the rg evolution of mass parameters ,",
    "the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb )  @xcite should be carefully examined .",
    "the successful radiative ewsb generally restricts susy - breaking parameters at high - energy scale and also low - energy superparticle spectrum in the top - bottom - tau yukawa unification .",
    "the resulting spectrum often leads to a large magnitude of low - energy threshold corrections , following which the prediction of third - generation fermion masses are difficult to be consistent with the experimentally allowed ranges  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we perform detailed analysis of radiative ewsb and third - generation fermion masses in grand unified models , taking into account the neutrino property indicated by the recent experimental results .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1 decay rate is also evaluated since the experimental constraint on the decay rate tends to severely restrict low - energy superparticle spectrum  @xcite . for comparison and completeness , we first review the top - bottom - tau yukawa unification without neutrino effects , following which we will include the effects of neutrino physics in two cases ; the first is to consider the yukawa unification of top , bottom , tau , and third - generation neutrino where no other ( small ) elements in yukawa matrices are involved , and in the second case , the large generation mixing in the lepton sector is included in the analysis by assuming the lopsided form of yukawa matrices . in both cases ,",
    "we introduce large majorana masses for right - handed neutrinos , and tiny neutrino masses are induced through the seesaw mechanism . since low - energy threshold correction to",
    "the bottom quark mass is rather sensitive to susy - breaking parameters , the running bottom quark mass is treated as an output parameter in order to reveal the behavior of threshold corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical top quark mass is used as an input quantity . in this paper",
    "we adopt the value @xmath3  gev  @xcite and give some comments on the case of the most recent report on the top quark mass @xmath4  gev  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : general ] we present an overview of the third - generation fermion masses , the @xmath1 constraint , and radiative ewsb in yukawa unification scenario where low - energy susy - breaking quantities are treated as free parameters .",
    "this treatment reveals preferred types of low - energy superparticle spectrum and provides an useful reference for later discussions of radiative ewsb in specific models . in section  [ sec : so10 ] the phenomenology of the top - bottom - tau yukawa unification is discussed .",
    "sections  [ sec : wrhnu ] and [ sec : lop ] include the neutrino effects into the analysis of ewsb ; with the yukawa unification of top - bottom - tau and third - generation neutrino in section  [ sec : wrhnu ] and with the lopsided form of mass textures in section  [ sec : lop ] .",
    "we summarize the results in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "in this section , we present an overview of low - energy phenomenology in general yukawa unification scenario ; the third - generation fermion masses , the @xmath5 decay , and the ewsb are discussed .",
    "we assume the gauge coupling unification and also yukawa coupling unification at the gut scale .",
    "the low - energy values of these dimensionless couplings are determined by solving rg equations . on the other hand , there is no assumption about gut models and dimensionful parameters at high - energy regime .",
    "accordingly , low - energy susy - breaking parameters are treated as independent variables .",
    "the general analysis given here reveals preferred types of low - energy spectrum and would be useful for later discussion in specific high - energy models with neutrino effects .    below the gut scale",
    ", the theory is assumed to be the mssm whose superpotential is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are three - generation matter superfields and higgs superfields , respectively .",
    "the @xmath14 complex matrices @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 with generation indices mean yukawa coupling constants and @xmath18 is the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter .",
    "we assume the yukawa coupling unification in that the 3 - 3 elements of yukawa matrices , i.e.  top , bottom , and tau yukawa couplings , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are unified at high - energy scale : @xmath22 where @xmath23  gev is the gut scale . the precise definition of @xmath24 will be given in the next section .",
    "we first review the rg evolution of third - generation yukawa couplings in yukawa unification scenario .",
    "it is found that the yukawa unification is compatible with the observed values of heavy fermion masses , while the low - energy prediction of mass eigenvalues is rather sensitive to superparticle spectrum  @xcite . in the following analysis ,",
    "the exact top - bottom - tau yukawa coupling unification is assumed at the gut scale and other small entries in yukawa matrices are safely neglected .",
    "once the unified gauge coupling @xmath25 and the unified yukawa coupling @xmath26 are fixed , one can evaluate with the mssm rg equations the @xmath27 running gauge and yukawa couplings at the @xmath28-boson mass scale @xmath29 .",
    "the yukawa couplings and the third - generation @xmath27 running fermion masses are related as @xmath30where @xmath31 parametrizes the @xmath27 higgs vev at the electroweak scale which is taken as @xmath32  gev . the angle @xmath33 is defined by the vev ratio of two higgs doublets as @xmath34 .",
    "the low - energy threshold corrections from heavy superparticles  @xcite , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , have been included .",
    "the yukawa unification at high - energy scale and the mssm rg evolution generally lead to almost the same size of top and bottom yukawa couplings , @xmath38 , and consequently the ratio @xmath39 should be very large to attain the observed mass hierarchy between the top and bottom quarks .",
    "the required value of @xmath39 is roughly estimated as @xmath40 if one neglects threshold corrections and small differences between the top and bottom yukawa couplings generated through the rg evolution down to low - energy regime .",
    "in such a large @xmath39 case , low - energy threshold corrections from heavy superparticles become important  @xcite .",
    "the sizes of corrections to gauge couplings and top quark mass @xmath35 mainly depend on the overall scale of superparticle masses . on the other hand ,",
    "the correction to bottom quark mass @xmath36 is controlled by a ratio between susy - breaking masses and the @xmath18 parameter .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath36 is dominated by finite parts of threshold corrections which are approximately constituted of the following two contributions  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 the corrections @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the contributions to @xmath36 from gluino - scalar bottom and chargino - scalar top loop diagrams .",
    "the susy - breaking couplings @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the gluino mass , the trilinear coupling of scalar top quark , and the mass eigenvalues of top and bottom scalar quarks , respectively .",
    "the complete form of corrections including generation mixing is found , e.g.  in  @xcite .",
    "the loop function @xmath49 behaves as @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the maximum value among @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "if there is no large hierarchy among susy - breaking mass parameters and @xmath18 , the corrections @xmath55 and @xmath56 are expected to become @xmath57 for a large value of @xmath39 .",
    "also @xmath37 is dominated by finite parts in the large @xmath39 case , but it is generally smaller than @xmath36 since the large gauge and yukawa couplings are absent in the expression of @xmath37 . in the yukawa unification scenario ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath37 roughly become @xmath58 when superparticles are lighter than a few tev  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we take susy - breaking parameters as free variables and let the threshold corrections @xmath59 represent low - energy superparticle spectrum . in other words ,",
    "once a preferred range of @xmath59 is found , that in turn gives a constraint on low - energy susy - breaking parameters . for fixed values of low - energy gauge couplings , top - quark and tau - lepton masses , and the threshold corrections @xmath60",

    "it is interesting to note that the left - handed sides of these inequalities are related to mass squareds of physical particles in the symmetry broken phase . in ( [ con1 ] ) , @xmath151 is relevant to tree - level masses of charginos and neutralinos . also the inequality ( [ con2 ] )",

    "therefore ( [ con1 ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) actually impose severer constraints on the higgs mass parameters .",

    "if @xmath39 is small , a larger value of the top yukawa coupling than the bottom ( and tau ) ensures such a mass separation via the rg evolution down to low energy , and successful ewsb is radiatively achieved  @xcite .",
    "however for the large @xmath39 case as in the yukawa unification , the top and bottom yukawa couplings are of almost same order of magnitude throughout the rg evolution , and the splitting of two higgs masses is not guaranteed .",
    "as will be seen in the following sections , if @xmath0-like gut models are assumed , this mass bound of cp - odd neutral higgs boson excludes large regions of high - energy susy - breaking parameter space .",
    "in this section we discuss the minimal @xmath0-type gut scenario which is a naive high - energy realization of the yukawa unification .",

    "we focus here on the study of radiative ewsb , third - generation fermion masses , and @xmath1 process for comparison with later discussions .",
    "the model we now consider is specified by the following assumptions : ( i ) @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken down to the sm gauge group at the gut scale @xmath24 , below which the theory is just the mssm .",

    "thus @xmath170 and @xmath169 can be taken as independent variables , and throughout this paper we equivalently use the following notation : @xmath185 in other words , @xmath186    in the following , we first discuss about the radiative ewsb and then study the parameter space allowed by third - generation fermion masses and the @xmath1 observation . as seen in the previous section ,",
    "the yukawa unification hypothesis leads to third - generation fermion masses strongly correlated to the threshold correction @xmath36 , which has large dependence on susy - breaking mass and @xmath18 parameters . since these parameters are severely restricted by the ewsb conditions and the @xmath1 constraint , it is a non - trivial issue whether the above type of @xmath0 unification is phenomenologically viable .",
    "we will present a detailed analysis on this subject in the below .      to have an insight about low - energy superparticle spectrum in the @xmath0-type unification , we start to discuss about the radiative ewsb .",

    "as discussed previously , the positiveness of @xmath159 , i.e.  a successful ewsb , requires the separation of higgs susy - breaking mass parameters , @xmath191 , at the electroweak scale . in the present @xmath0-type unification",
    "where the two higgs masses are unified at the gut scale , the ewsb must be triggered purely by radiative corrections .",
    "it is found from fig .",
    "[ fit1 ] that the contributions of gaugino mass @xmath192 and of scalar mass @xmath193 have similar magnitudes with opposite signs , while the other effects are relatively small .",
    "this suggests that a difference between up- and down - type higgs masses is not generated in the rg evolution due to the structure of yukawa couplings : the gut - scale yukawa unification means not only the top but also the bottom and tau yukawa couplings are as large as @xmath57 which induce significant rg effects on the down - type higgs mass to make it equal to the up - type higgs mass in low - energy higgs potential .",
    "consequently the condition for positive @xmath159 naively seems difficult to be satisfied .    in the present model we now consider",

    "the radiative ewsb does not occur .",

    "if smaller terms of @xmath172 and @xmath202 are neglected , the experimental lower bound on cp - odd neutral higgs mass @xmath203 gives the following restriction between gaugino and scalar mass parameters : @xmath204 it is found from explicit numerical values in fig .",

    "the numerical solution of the rg equations ( @xmath189 s in fig .  [ fit1 ] ) indicates that the dominant positive contribution is the gaugino mass effect ( @xmath213 ) .",

    "the constraint ( [ mabound ] ) however means that such scalar mass contribution can not be larger than that of gaugino , even if @xmath202 has its maximal value @xmath217 .",
    "furthermore a large value of @xmath202 leads to the lsp scalar tau lepton and is disfavored .",
    "the other effects from the @xmath172 and @xmath29 terms are negligibly small .",

    "in these ways the radiative ewsb in the @xmath0-type unification requires a restricted type of low - energy superparticle spectrum .",

    "the ewsb constraints ( [ mabound ] ) and ( [ mu ] ) mean that the pq and r symmetries are largely violated , and the threshold correction becomes large as discussed in section  [ sec : tbtau ] .",
    "secondly , the @xmath1 amplitude becomes large since the charged higgs contribution @xmath106 is enhanced by a light charged higgs boson @xmath221 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath131 , the observation of @xmath1 rare decay severely restricts the parameter space of the model .",
    "the enhancements of the threshold correction @xmath36 and the @xmath1 amplitude generally make the minimal @xmath0-type unification difficult to be consistent with the observation .",
    "we perform the numerical analysis of parameter space in the minimal @xmath0-type unification which space is allowed by the experimental constraints from the bottom quark mass and the @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "the input parameters are the same as those in section  [ sec : general ] , and the top quark mass is @xmath121  gev .",

    "on the other hand , a similar type of ewsb is also viable with some specific types of non - universal scalar masses which do not respect @xmath0 unified gauge symmetry . in these cases ,",
    "approximate pq and r symmetries are realized in low - energy mass spectrum .    in the following sections , we investigate alternative possibilities to attain pq and/or r symmetric spectrum which include the effects inspired by neutrino physics in @xmath0 models , and will find new types of radiative ewsb scenarios .",
    "it has been indicated by various recent experiments that neutrinos have tiny mass scale less than a few ev , which is extremely smaller than the other sm fermion masses . in the framework of @xmath0 unification ,",
    "a 16-plet contains a single field under the sm gauge group which may be naturally identified to a right - handed neutrino . the @xmath0-invariant superpotential term @xmath253 generates neutrino yukawa couplings among the left- and right - handed neutrinos and the up - type higgs boson .",
    "thus neutrinos obtain a similar size of dirac masses to the other sm fermions and the observed tiny mass scale seems unnatural . a promising way to cure",
    "this problem is to introduce large majorana masses for right - handed neutrinos .",
    "integrated out the heavy right - handed neutrinos , tiny majorana masses are generated for left - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "thus the superpotential terms below the gut scale in this scenario is given by @xmath254 the last two terms are introduced in addition to the mssm superpotential ( [ mssmspot ] ) where @xmath255 is the neutrino yukawa matrix and @xmath256 denotes large - scale majorana masses for right - handed neutrino superfields @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) . as in the previous yukawa unified scenarios , we naturally have a hierarchical order of neutrino yukawa couplings and then only the third diagonal element is large ; @xmath259 , which is expected to be of the same order of the top yukawa coupling in @xmath0 unification .",
    "such a hierarchy assumption might also be applied to the majorana mass matrix of right - handed neutrinos . in the following analysis",
    "we simply have the 3 - 3 element of the majorana mass matrix as @xmath260  gev .",
    "the minimal @xmath0-type unification discussed in the previous section corresponds to the case that @xmath261 is equal to or larger than the gut - breaking scale .",
    "the other matrix elements of neutrino couplings are smaller than these dominant 3 - 3 elements , and might be responsible for explaining the observed large generation mixing of light neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the details of these small matrix elements are completely irrelevant to the following rg analysis and can be dropped .",
    "if there were other yukawa matrix elements than @xmath262 which take @xmath57 values , the effects of neutrino couplings are enhanced accordingly .",
    "however in this paper we assume a conservative case that only the tau - neutrino yukawa coupling is large .    in this section ,",
    "we study the unification scenario with @xmath263 . as a result ,",
    "the effects of neutrino couplings become important in the rg evolution between @xmath24 and @xmath261 .",
    "the influences of neutrino yukawa couplings have been studied concerning on the gauge coupling unification  @xcite and the third - generation fermion masses  @xcite . also in ref .",
    "@xcite , the radiative ewsb is examined in the case of large violation of pq and r symmetries .",
    "it was found that such neutrino yukawa effect is less than a few percents and the qualitative discussion , e.g.  that given in section  [ sec : tbtau ] , is also applied to our present case . in particular , a successful prediction of bottom quark mass still requires that the threshold correction @xmath36 at susy - breaking scale must be suppressed . on the other hand , as will be shown below , neutrino couplings play a significant role in the rg evolution of susy - breaking parameters .",
    "thus the picture of radiative ewsb and superparticle mass spectrum are found to be considerably altered from the minimal @xmath0-type unification .",
    "we will show that neutrino coupling effects make it possible to attain pq and r symmetric radiative ewsb which is preferred by the bottom quark mass prediction in the large @xmath39 case .",
    "let us first see how the radiative ewsb scenario is altered by introducing neutrino couplings .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos contribute the one - loop rg equations for higgs susy - breaking mass parameters which are given by @xmath264above the decoupling scale of ( the third - generation ) right - handed neutrino @xmath261 .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath178 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 are the abbreviations of the third diagonal elements of left- , right - handed scalar neutrino mass matrices , and trilinear coupling of scalar neutrinos , respectively .",
    "the wavefunction renormalization of up - type higgs scalar is affected by propagating right - handed neutrinos but that of down - type higgs scalar is not . as a result ,",
    "only the rg equation of up - type higgs mass ( [ mhurge ] ) receives the additional terms ( @xmath267 ) from the neutrino sector .",
    "these terms are naturally positive in the rg evolution down to @xmath261 and lowers @xmath160 in the infrared region , compared to the mssm prediction .",
    "the down - type higgs mass is not altered at one - loop order .    as seen in the previous section",
    ", the @xmath0-type yukawa unification generally leads to only a tiny difference between up- and down - type higgs masses at the electroweak scale and excludes a large portion of parameter space by the experimental bound of cp - odd neutral higgs mass which is proportional to that mass difference .",
    "this fact reflects the @xmath196 symmetry which is violated only by the small @xmath70 gauge coupling and the absence of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "in particular , the latter decreases the down - type higgs mass by tau yukawa effect in the rg evolution . in the present scenario , including the neutrino couplings in the rg equation of @xmath160 tends to cancel the tau yukawa effect and provides a positive contribution to the cp - odd neutral higgs mass squared .",
    "consequently the radiative ewsb is expected to be made more natural than the minimal @xmath0-type unification .",
    "the one - loop rg equations for scalar lepton masses are also affected by the neutrino couplings . in particular",
    "the scalar tau mass eigenvalue is decreased and the requirement of charge - neutral lsp becomes severer than the minimal @xmath0-type unification . if considered the r symmetric radiative ewsb , the scalar tau lepton could readily be made heavier than the lightest neutralino .",
    "that will be checked in the numerical analysis below .    in the following we simply take @xmath268 at the gut scale for comparison to the analysis of yukawa unification in the previous sections .",
    "evaluating the rg evolution of higgs mass parameters , we obtain the rg solutions in the ewsb vacuum : @xmath269     & & \\qquad + e_aa_0 ^ 2 + e_{a_\\nu}a_{\\nu0}^2 + e_{aa_\\nu}a_0a_{\\nu0 }    -m_z^2 ,   \\label{mafit2 } \\\\[2 mm ]    |\\mu|^2 & \\;=\\ ; & ( f_{ms}+f_{md}\\xi)\\tilde m_0 ^ 2     + f_{m\\nu}m_{\\tilde\\nu0}^2 + f_m m_{1/2}^2     + f_{am}a_0m_{1/2 } + f_{a_\\nu m}a_{\\nu0}m_{1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\qquad + f_aa_0 ^ 2 + f_{a_\\nu}a_{\\nu0}^2 + f_{aa_\\nu}a_0a_{\\nu0 }    -\\frac{m_z^2}{2 } ,   \\label{mufit2}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath270 and @xmath271 are the boundary values of @xmath272 and @xmath266 at the gut - breaking scale . in order to clarify the effects of neutrino couplings ,",
    "we have separated them from the other parameters of charged fields , the latter of which are simply assumed to be unified at the gut scale for comparison to the previous @xmath0-type unified scenario .",
    "the separation of neutrino susy - breaking parameters while keeping ( approximate ) yukawa unification is dynamically corroborated , e.g.  in the framework that right - handed neutrinos contain low - energy remnants of gauge - singlet superfields .",
    "when the mixture is tiny between such extra singlets and the third - generation @xmath273 in the @xmath274 multiplet , the yukawa unification is almost preserved . on the other hand , susy - breaking parameters of neutrinos are significantly modified if the extra singlets receive larger breaking effects than the ordinary matter .",
    "that could be easily realized if the extra fields directly couple to susy - breaking sector and the others are not .",
    "a simpler and alternative mechanism for separating the neutrino effect is to assume that neutrino yukawa couplings for the first and second generations have @xmath57 values , which turn out to enhance rg running effects of neutrino couplings .",
    "that is possible since the neutrino mass spectrum has not been experimentally determined unlike the other charged fermions .",
    "anyway the neutrino couplings are regarded as free parameters and can be large .",

    "this asymmetric form of yukawa couplings is referred to as the lopsided form in the literature  @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of lopsided mass matrices is that the observed large leptonic 2 - 3 generation mixing is explained by dominant two elements in the charged - lepton yukawa matrix with @xmath332 , while preserving small quark generation mixing because only right - handed down - type quarks are largely mixed and it does not contribute to the physical quark mixing .",
    "various types of gut scenarios with lopsided mass matrices have been studied . in dynamical models based on the @xmath0 group ,",
    "some non - minimal field contents are involved to realize the lopsided form of yukawa couplings .",
    "for example , the mssm matter and higgs fields do not have ordinary high - energy origins such as @xmath163 and @xmath164 adopted in the previous sections .",
    "this possibility has also been used to construct realistic models with larger unified symmetry than @xmath0 .    in this section ,",
    "we study phenomenological issues such as the radiative ewsb in the @xmath0 unification which accommodates lopsided mass matrices for neutrino physics .",
    "we typically consider the following form of yukawa couplings at the gut scale : @xmath333 where blank entries in each matrix are small compared to the filled entries .",
    "the near - maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing is explained by assuming that @xmath334 is of similar order to @xmath335 . in the following analysis",

    "a crucial observation for lopsided matrix form is the multiplicity of @xmath326 components in the theory .",
    "that is , while right - handed down quarks and lepton doublets are combined into @xmath326 representations of @xmath2 , there is no way to identify to which multiplet this @xmath326 should be embedded in larger symmetry than @xmath2 .",
    "in fact there are several sources of @xmath326 in @xmath0 theory ; @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath311 representations , etc . the simplest case for realizing lopsided generations",
    "is to suppose the second and third generation @xmath326 s have different origins in more fundamental theory like @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in an explicit @xmath0 model  @xcite , the second generation fields in @xmath326 come unusually from a decuplet @xmath338 of @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", low - energy down - type higgs field should be a mixed state of @xmath338 and @xmath339 higgs multiplets , otherwise several fermions become massless .",
    "the angle @xmath337 parametrizes the degree of such higgs mixing ; the down - type higgs @xmath340 is composed as @xmath341 where @xmath342 and @xmath343 are the anti quintuplets contained in @xmath164 and @xmath344 higgs fields , respectively .",
    "the angle @xmath337 is dynamically controlled in terms of mass parameters in gut higgs potential . an @xmath0 invariant superpotential term @xmath345 gives a lopsided matrix with @xmath346 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that such @xmath326 flipping just corresponds to the @xmath196 rotation in @xmath0 or higher theory . in the minimal @xmath0-type unification ,",
    "the @xmath196 invariance in the higgs sector is only weakly violated by small couplings , which makes the radiative ewsb difficult to be achieved .",
    "however in the present case , @xmath196 is strongly broken by the mixing of two types of @xmath326 s , and the radiative ewsb is expected to be easily made successful .",
    "a similar analysis may also be performed for gut models based on higher gauge groups than @xmath0 , e.g.  the @xmath347 unification .",
    "an important difference appears in that , in the @xmath347 unification , the third - generation fields in @xmath326 have high - energy embedding into a @xmath338-plet of @xmath0 group . that implies ( i ) the matching conditions of the second and third - generation anti",

    "this is because the magnitude of bottom - quark and tau - lepton yukawa couplings are suppressed by the factor @xmath350 .",
    "for a moderate value of @xmath39 , the bottom / tau mass ratio ( without threshold corrections ) is reached in the rg evolution down to low - energy regime to a larger value than that in large @xmath39 case .",
    "this is because the yukawa dependent contributions are reduced in the rg evolution of yukawa couplings for a fixed value of @xmath73 . with this behavior",

    "for @xmath352 , the top quark mass @xmath73 is decreased as @xmath353 and @xmath26 is consequently increased .",
    "thus the above discussion is not applied to the case of near - maximal value @xmath354 . in the following analysis",
    "we do not consider such a small value of @xmath39 .",
    "notice also from the figure that the absolute value of threshold correction to bottom quark mass must still be smaller than its naively expected size .",
    "thus the argument of pq and r symmetries may be helpful for suppressing @xmath36 and attaining the experimentally - allowed value of bottom quark mass similarly to the minimal @xmath0-type unification .",
    "however there is an important difference between them ; in the present model , the desired suppression factor of threshold correction @xmath36 and also @xmath39 have significant dependences on @xmath337 , which induces neutrino large mixing .",
    "in particular , even a bit large value of @xmath83 is possible for small @xmath350 .",

    "thus the pq and r symmetric radiative ewsb is possible with @xmath351 and a positive @xmath251-term contribution .",
    "the observed bottom quark mass and the @xmath1 constraint are easily satisfied with a few tev scalar quarks .",
    "the lightest neutralino and chargino contain a sizable amount of higgsino components , which may be suitable for cosmological issues such as lsp dark matter . for @xmath386 , while the pq symmetric mass spectrum is not consistent with the positiveness of cp - odd neutral higgs mass squared , the bottom quark mass is made within the experimental range only with help of r symmetry and relatively heavy scalars @xmath435  tev .",
    "we have also examined the modification of @xmath2 symmetric yukawa couplings by introducing a group - theoretical factor for the masses of the second - generation fermions being properly reproduced .",
    "a crucial consequence of this modification is that the low - energy bottom quark mass without threshold correction is turned out to be reduced and a positive @xmath18 parameter is predicted . in this case , the @xmath1 decay rate is made suppressed via diagram cancellations .",
    "superparticles also exhibit light and non - hierarchical mass spectrum .",
    "these features are quite different from the other scenarios discussed in this paper .    in any case",
    ", our study has shown that the neutrino coupling effects induce new types of ewsb in @xmath0 unification consistent with various experimental constraints .",
    "physical implications of these scenarios such as predicted superparticle spectrum would be tested in the future experimental searches of supersymmetry .",
    "the authors would like to thank atsushi watanabe for helpful discussions .",
