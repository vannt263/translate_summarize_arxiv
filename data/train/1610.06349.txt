    "simulation of electron backscattering based on geant4 @xcite has been investigated in a variety of configurations @xcite , as this observable is a sensitive probe of multiple and single scattering modeling in monte carlo codes for particle transport .",
    "apparent anomalies , leading to the suppression of backscattering , were observed in association with some physics configurations @xcite ; dedicated investigations @xcite hinted that some of the step limitation algorithms related to the treatment of multiple scattering could be sensitive to peculiarities of the geant4 geometry domain , while single scattering simulation appeared to be immune from such effects .",
    "the observed inconsistency of the backscattering simulation outcome , which appeared to depend on the configuration of the experimental setup in the simulation , precluded unequivocal quantification of the accuracy of geant4 multiple and single scattering models and their relative comparison in @xcite .",
    "these issues have been addressed in geant4 10.1p02 and later versions , thus allowing consistent quantification of geant4 capability to simulate electron backscattering in a variety of physics configurations and of their relative ability to reproduce experimental measurements .",
    "geant4 version 10.2 also includes two new electron scattering implementations and a new predefined _ physicsconstructor _ , which are quantitatively evaluated in an experimental test case for the first time in this paper .",
    "the goudsmit - saunderson @xcite multiple scattering model was completely reimplemented in geant4 10.2 on the basis of a reworked analytical foundation of the code : although the new model retains the same class name present in previous geant4 versions , the code is entirely new . a predefined",

    "a single scattering model based on the mott cross section @xcite , which did not work properly in previous geant4 versions , and for this reason could not be used in the tests of @xcite , was modified to become functional in geant4 10.2 .",
    "this model extends the provision of methods to simulate electron scattering as a discrete process in geant4 , as an alternative to condensed history schemes usually adopted in particle transport through multiple scattering modeling .",
    "this paper documents quantitatively the effects of these geant4 evolutions on the fraction of backscattered electrons .",
    "this observable is the most basic probe of the simulation of electron scattering in particle transport codes ; its assessment is preparative to the validation of more complex observables related to electron scattering , such as the energy and angular distributions of scattered particles .",
    "special emphasis is given in the following section to the characterization of the new physics modeling options available in geant4 with respect to experimental measurements , and the assessment of their capabilities in comparison to other , previously available , options .",

    "the deterioration of compatibility with experiment is confirmed in the results obtained with the 10.2p01 and 10.2p02 versions . this decrease does not appear to be due to the larger value of the _ rangefactor _ parameter recommended for the new implementation , as comparable results are obtained with the recommended value of 0.12 and with the value of 0.01 set in the gsbrf1 configuration , which is the same as in the simulation with the gsbrf configuration in the geant4 10.1p03 environment . since the efficiencies associated with simulation configurations involving other multiple scattering models ( urban and wentzelvi ) remain statistically equivalent above 100  kev over the geant4 versions considered in table [ tab_eff ] , it is unlikely that the degradation of compatibility with experiment could originate from evolutions in geant4 kernel code other than the implementation of goudsmit - saunderson multiple scattering .",

    "it should be noted , however , that the efficiencies at lower energies are substantially lower than those achieved above 100 kev by the most efficient configurations .",

    "statistical tests do not have sufficient discriminant power to appraise differences in compatibility with experiment between 100 kev and the nominal lower applicability limit of 200 kev due to the scarce amount of experimental data available in this energy range .",
    "although the geant4 documentation says that the _ g4esinglecoulombscatteringmodel _ model is applicable to scattering between electrons and medium - light nuclei , no significant difference related to the target atomic number is observed regarding the capability to reproduce the experimental fraction of backscattered electrons .",
