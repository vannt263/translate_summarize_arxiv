    "2004 ) ; the redshifts , star formation and agn activity of dogs will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "a redshift distribution peaking around 2 is expected for the dogs selection criteria since the 24@xmath4 m detection will limit the sample to sources below @xmath37 and the red mid - ir to optical color allows only for sources which are very faint in the optical , which weeds out many @xmath38 sources .",
    "d08 presented a redshift distribution for bright ( @xmath39mjy ) dogs based on spectroscopically measured redshifts , resulting in a gaussian distribution with z=2.0 and @xmath40=0.5 .",
    "d08 also note no obvious dependence of redshift on 24@xmath4 m flux within their sample .",
    "f08 presented a photometric redshift distribution for galaxies which meet their two color selections down to @xmath15jy , and it is remarkably similar to that of the d08 dogs .",
    "this suggests that our @xmath1jy sample of dogs will also have a similar redshift distribution to that of the brighter dogs in d08 .",
    "the redshifts for the 12 goods - n dogs with irs spectra range from 1.62.6 with a peak at 2 , consistent with the spectroscopic redshift distribution from d08 .",
    "however , 10/12 of the goods - n dogs with irs spectra are brighter than @xmath21jy .",
    "in addition to the 12 dogs with irs spectra , only 1 additional dog has an optical spectroscopic redshift from the @xmath41 spectroscopic redshifts available in goods - n emphasizing how faint these galaxies are in the optical .",

    "although most dogs are too faint in the optical to yield accurate traditional optical photometric redshifts , we can use the irac photometry as a rough estimate of the redshift since at @xmath43 these channels sample the 1.6@xmath4 m stellar bump ( e.g.  simpson & eisenhardt 1999 , sawicki 2002 ) .",

    ", we used the independent photometric - redshift estimate derived in pope et al .",
    "equation 2 of pope et al .",
    "( 2006 ) provides a simple empirical relation between the redshift and the irac and mips 24@xmath4 m photometry which has been tuned to smgs with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the application of this relation to the dogs may be justified on the basis that both dogs and smgs are dust obscured populations of galaxies , and may therefore have similar seds .",
    "indeed , the median irac flux densities of the dogs and smgs in goods - n are almost identical .",
    "we first tested this photometric redshift technique using the bootes dogs with spectroscopic redshifts ( d08 ) .",
    "we removed the dogs which show a power - law in irac since this method relies on the presence of the stellar bump to estimate the redshift .",

    "this photometric redshift estimator appears to do a reasonable job in estimating the redshift distribution of dogs , although on an individual basis the redshifts are still quite uncertain . the redshift distribution for the goods - n dogs using equation 2 of pope et al .

    "based on the irs spectral results , we use this color cut ( shown by the dashed line in fig .",

    "the median 24@xmath4 m flux densities for the sf and agn dogs are 175 and 310@xmath4jy , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the previously noted trend where agn contribution increases with @xmath25 ( e.g.  brand et al .",

    "alternatively , the agn dogs could have higher @xmath59 colors because they contain a heavily obscured agn ; adding more obscuration to a power - law agn will decrease @xmath60 more than @xmath25 leading to redder colors ( sajina et al .  2007 ) .",
    "we find that the two agn dogs which have both red @xmath59 colors as well as irs spectra show a continuum dominated mid - ir spectrum and have no x - ray detection in the deep _ chandra _ images indicating that they harbor compton - thick agn .",

    "@xmath61 agn dogs with x - ray detections have an effective photon index of @xmath62 and an x - ray luminosity of @xmath63 ( assuming @xmath64 ) which indicates that the x - rays are coming from obscured agn emission ( alexander et al .",
    "2005 , 2008 ) ; only 3/7 sf dogs with x - ray detections satisfy these criteria . stacking the x - ray undetected dogs in the central 6.5 arcminute ( radius ) region of the x - ray image ( see section 4.2 of alexander et al .",
    "2008 for details ) gives a detection in the full and soft bands , but not in the hard band ( table [ tab : xray ] ) .",

    "our @xmath66 upper limit on the hardness ratio of sf dogs is within the error bar of the measured value of f08 .",
    "a number of factors could lead to a difference in the x - ray stacking results including the area of the x - ray image used in the stacking analysis , the sample size ( f08 are stacking 111 objects ) , and of course the limiting depth at @xmath22 m . stacking the mid - ir classified sf and agn dogs",
    "separately we obtain similar results and conclude that the stacked x - ray hardness ratio of the two sub - samples can not be distinguished within our uncertainty . for the sf dogs we estimate @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the 1.56@xmath7kev observed luminosity assuming @xmath70 .",
    "this x - ray luminosity is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the bright smgs ( alexander et al .",

    "bright ( @xmath6mjy ) smgs contribute @xmath117 , with fainter ( @xmath118mjy ) smgs contributing @xmath119 at @xmath43 ( wall et al .",
    "in addition to the dog samples , several different selection criteria using _ spitzer _ data have been presented in the literature to isolate ulirgs at high redshifts ( e.g.  yan et al .  2007 ;",
    "farrah et al .  2008 ) , although none of these select a population as numerous as the dogs .",
    "table [ tab : ids ] shows that 70% of dogs are detected in the radio .",
    "since dogs by definition are faint in the optical , these radio - detected dogs would be similar to the optically - faint radio galaxies ( ofrgs ) discussed in chapman et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "smgs are thought to be galaxies in the early stage of a massive merger ( e.g. , conselice et al",
    ".  2003 ; pope et al .  2008 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2008 ) , and d08 propose that bright dogs might be a later stage in the merger . in support of this , we find that @xmath120 of smgs meet the dogs criteria and all 3 smgs which have @xmath54 agn contribution in the mid - ir ( pope et al .",
    "2008 ) are in our sample of agn dogs .",
    "this implies that dogs selection preferentially picks up the more agn dominated smgs , although these are among the most luminous dogs .",
    "the average sf dog shows additional mid - ir emission compared to the normalized smg sed , which may be enhanced pah emission or hot dust heated by an agn or star formation .",
    "regardless of the source of the mid - ir excess emission ( which accounts for @xmath121 of the total ir luminosity ) , the average @xmath92 and x - ray luminosity of the sf dogs is several times less than that of most smgs indicating that the average dog is not likely to evolve from smgs .",
    "[ fig : bzk ] shows that most dogs satisfy the _",
    "selection ; while they have ulirg - like luminosities _ bzk _ galaxies are thought to be forming stars continuously over longer timescales and do not necessarily require a major merger as as catalyst for star formation ( daddi et al .",
    "2008 ) . in summary ,",
    "we remind the reader that this analysis is focussed on the average properties of dogs in goods - n ; while the average dog is less luminous than @xmath6mjy smgs , some fraction of the dogs are related to smgs as shown in the 30% of smgs which meet the dogs criteria . in order to obtain a submm sample of comparable number density to the @xmath1jy dogs sample",
    "requires a survey down to @xmath122mjy ( coppin et al .",
    "2006 ) . this will be achieved with future deep scuba-2 surveys and allow for a more detailed comparison between dogs and submm - emitting galaxies .",
    "from a sample of 79 faint ( @xmath1jy ) dogs in goods - n ( @xmath123arcmin@xmath115 ) , we find that almost all satisfy the criteria for compton - thick agn from f08 .",
    "however , based on _ spitzer _ spectroscopy and photometry , we show that 80% of are likely dominated by star formation .",
    "the stacked x - ray emission from the mid - ir classified star forming dogs is consistent with what is expected from star formation .",
    "the irs spectra and _ spitzer _ photometric redshifts confirm that these faint dogs lie in a tight redshift distribution around @xmath3 . stacking the mid - ir , far - ir and submm flux of the star forming dogs",
    ", we derive an average sed with @xmath124 , 8 times less luminous than most bright ( @xmath6mjy ) smgs .",
    "the composite sed of dogs has a similar shape to that of smgs in the far - ir ( dust temperature of around 30@xmath7k ) but has a higher mid - ir to far - ir flux ratio ( @xmath111 compared to @xmath125 for smgs ) .",
    "this suggests that there is a wide range of @xmath112 conversions in @xmath43 galaxies which need to be considered when interpreting the total ir luminosity density and sfrd from 24@xmath4 m surveys .",
    "this paper has relied strongly on stacking analysis to obtain average properties of dogs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "future deep surveys with _",
    "herschel _ and scuba-2 will detect the majority of dogs putting constraints on their individual ir luminosities and dust temperatures .",
