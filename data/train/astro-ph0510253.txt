    "the diffuse stellar halo component of galaxies represents a tiny fraction of the mass ( about 1% in the case of the milky way ; morrison 1993 ) and the low surface brightness of the population makes study in extragalactic settings difficult . however , galactic halos are unique laboratories for investigating fundamental galaxy properties",
    ". age and/or metallicity distributions of halo stellar populations and their kinematics provide fossilized glimpses of the earliest conditions of galaxy formation .",
    "halo populations may give us answers to key questions about the chronology of galaxy formation : how the halo formation was related to the assembly of galactic mass and the formation of galaxies .",
    "different views have been advanced toward understanding the formation of galactic stellar halos .",
    "the first scenario was proposed by eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage ( 1962 ) , where the authors proposed that the metal - poor stars in the galactic halo were formed during a rapid collapse of a relatively uniform , isolated protogalactic cloud .",
    "this picture is generally viewed as advocating a rapid dissipative and monolithic collapse of protogalaxies .",
    "an increasing number of observational findings , both at high redshift and in nearby galaxies , together with cosmological models of structure formation , challenge this general view , and suggest an alternative picture of how halos of galaxies may have formed . this alternative paradigm for halo formation",
    "is based on the idea that the galactic halo was formed via the accretion , over an extended period , of small metal - poor satellites which underwent independent chemical evolution before being accreted ( searle & zinn 1978 ; see also freeman 1987 ) .",
    "the disruption of globular clusters , revealed by tidal tails ( grillmair et al .",
    "1995 ) , may also contribute to the stellar halo ( aguilar et al .",
    "this is supported by the observation that halo field stars and globular clusters in the milky way have similar mean metallicities ( carney 1993 ) .",
    "note that this is not the case for m  31 stellar halo ( durrell et al .",
    "2001 , perrett et al .",
    "an interesting consequence of this hypothesis is that a fraction of globular clusters may be stripped relics of highly nucleated dwarf satellites ( see freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the discovery of the sgr dwarf galaxy ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) , streams and moving groups in halos of both the galaxy ( yanny et al . 2000 ; ivezic et al .",
    "2000 ; dohm - palmer et al . 2001 ) and m31 ( ibata et al . 2001 ) encourage renewed interest in halo formation through accretion of smaller protogalactic structures .",
    "although great effort has been dedicated in recent years to investigate stellar populations and/or kinematic of local group spiral halos , it is unlikely that the problem of galactic halo formation may be understood entirely by studies of these galaxies alone .",
    "questions about the universality of halo formation mechanism(s ) , the similarity of halo global properties and their sensitivity to disk and/or bulge properties , among others , will require a larger sample of galaxies .",
    "one means of addressing these questions is to extend the study of galaxy halos to other spiral galaxies .",
    "such studies are now within reach of the hst .",
    "our purpose is to study systematically the _ global properties of population ii halos _ of nearby normal spiral galaxies .",
    "such a program may reveal whether there was a universal formation mechanism , or whether there are mixture of different stellar halos ; if the halos are dominated by formation of the nuclear bulge and perhaps enriched by gas outflow , or composed of debris of disintegrated dwarf galaxies revealed by the presence of a large fraction of intermediate age stellar populations .",
    "also of great interest is the investigation of whether halo and disk / bulge properties are correlated .    in order to interpret the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of resolved stars in nearby galaxies",
    "it is important to have reliable distance estimates .",
    "fortunately , sometimes the cmds themselves provide such an estimate .",
    "stars on the first - ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) climb this phase with an expanding convective envelope and an hydrogen burning shell .",
    "while evolving through the rgb , low - mass stars develop an electron - degenerate core , which causes an explosive start of the core - he burning phase , the so - called he - flash , almost independently from the initial stellar parameters , such as initial mass or abundance ( chiosi et al .",
    "the he - flash is followed by a sudden decrease of the stellar luminosity due to the extinction of the h - burning shell .",
    "hence low - mass stars will accumulate along the rgb , reaching their maximum luminosity , during this phase , at the tip of rgb ( trgb ) .",
    "this behavior translates to an abrupt discontinuity in the luminosity function ( renzini 1992 ) .",
    "as the evolution of the rgb stars depends essentially on the core - mass , the number of stars per luminosity interval will be related directly to the he - core growth rate ( iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "theoretical and observational investigations find the luminosity function of rgb stars to follow a simple power - law ( see zoccali & piotto 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the trgb magnitude is the location where the rgb luminosity function truncates .",
    "below metallicities @xmath2 \\approx -0.7}$ ] , the location of the trgb in the @xmath0 band is expected to be quite insensitive to age and/or metallicity ( e.g. , salaris & cassisi 1997 ) . at higher metallicities ,",
    "bolometric corrections in the @xmath0 band become important and the trgb magnitude becomes increasingly sensitive to metallicity ( e.g. , salaris & girardi 2005 ) .",
    "the trgb method is also well supported observationally .",
    "the location of the absolute i - band trgb luminosity for a sample of galactic globular clusters spanning a large range of abundances , @xmath3 \\leq -0.7}$ ] , over ages spanning 2 - 15gyr ( da costa & armandroff 1990 ) , is quite stable and insensitive to age and metallicity ( for @xmath4 \\leq -0.7 $ ] ) , changing by less than @xmath5mag ( lee et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "good agreement is generally found between the distances obtained using the trgb method and classical distance indicators such as cepheid and rr lyrae variables ( e.g. , sakai et al .",
    "1996 , ferrarese et al .",
    "being a population ii distance indicator , unlike the cepheid method ( population i distance indicator ) , the trgb method can be applied to any class of galaxies , making this an attractive and easy technique to use to estimate galaxy distances .    because the outer regions of galaxies are devoid of significant concentrations of gas and dust and the stellar density is low , studies of standard candles in the halo provide a means of estimating distances free of assumptions concerning internal reddening in galaxies or crowding . in   [ data ] , the details of observations using the hst wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and data reduction are reported . in   [ methods ] , we present the detection of rgb stars and the methods for measuring the trgb using the @xmath0-band luminosity function that we have employed . finally , in   [ dist ] , we present the color  magnitude diagrams , luminosity functions , and derived distances for the galaxies studied .",
    "until recently , no spiral galaxy halo outside of the local group had been imaged to a depth sufficient to permit study of the halo metallicity distribution function or other stellar population studies , such as the presence of intermediate - age stars .",
    "hst observations have begun to change this . we have observed a sample of spiral galaxies with the aim of unambiguously resolving their stellar halos down to one or two magnitudes below the trgb .",
    "our selection criteria of the sample galaxies are as follows .",
    "we seek spiral galaxies with ( i ) morphological types between sa to sc , ( ii ) distance moduli @xmath6 , ( iii ) high inclinations , i.e. , @xmath7 degrees , to reduce any contamination from the outer disk stars , and ( iv ) absolute magnitudes @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting sample of eight galaxies represents most of the nearby luminous inclined spiral galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we estimate the distances to four galaxies in our sample , i.e. , ngc  253 , ngc  4244 , ngc  4258 , and ngc  4945 , using the tip of the red giant branch technique .",
    "[ field_location ] shows the locations of the observed halo fields , superimposed on the digitized sky survey images of these galaxies .",
    "madore & freedman ( 1995 ) argue that in order to minimize potential biases and to securely identify the trgb , there should be at least 50100 stars in the first magnitude interval of the rgb star luminosity function . with sparser",
    "data sets the distance modulus tends to be overestimated .",
    "four galaxies in our sample have luminosity functions that are too poorly populated to yield reliable trgb distances : ngc  55 , ngc  247 , ngc  300 , and ngc  3031 .",
    "hence these galaxies are not discussed in the present paper ; the color - magnitude diagrams of the observed halo fields for these galaxies are shown and discussed in paper iii of this series .",
    "tikhonov , galazutdinova & drozdovsky ( 2005 ) estimate trgb distances for three of these galaxies using larger hst data sets . the galaxy sample is summarized in table 1 .",
    "the galaxies were observed through the f814w and f606w filters .",
    "exposure times through the f814w filter were set to reach s / n = 5 in the wf camera for an absolute magnitude @xmath9 ( for galaxies with @xmath10 ) or @xmath11 ( for ngc4258 and ngc4945 , which are more distant ) .",
    "the f606w exposure times were set to reach the same s / n at the same absolute magnitude for metal - poor rgb stars .",
    "the exposures were typically dithered over 3 separate pointings ( the range being from 2 to 6 ) with a pattern extending over approximately 0.25 arcseconds to allow rejection of hot pixels and detector artifacts .",
    "the images were reduced through the standard hst pipeline , using the latest flatfield observations and using contemporaneous super - dark reference frames .",
    "the dithered frames were combined with iterative cosmic ray rejection using software in the stsdas.dither package based on the drizzle algorithm of fruchter and hook ( 2002 ) .",
    "briefly , the images were drizzled ( shifted , geometrically corrected , and resampled ) to a common frame to construct a median image reasonably free of cosmic rays .",
    "this image was geometrically transformed back to the pixel grids of the original image and used as the truth image for identifying cosmic rays .",
    "the images were then re - drizzled onto a pixel scale of 0.1@xmath12 , masking out the cosmic rays , hot pixels , and detector artifacts , using optimal weights based on the counts at the sky level in each image .",
    "a value pixfrac=0.8 was used to minimize the degradation of the image quality due to the resampling .",
    "the stellar magnitudes were measured through circular apertures with a radius of 0.15 .",
    "these aperture magnitudes were corrected to total magnitudes using tinytim model ( krist 2004 ) point - spread functions .",
    "aperture - corrections and zeropoints are applied separately for each ccd chip .",
    "magnitudes are in the vega system ( i.e. , vega has magnitude=0 through both filters , when measured through a 3aperture ) .",
    "diffuse sources have been excluded from the catalogs based on the magnitude difference between measurements through 0.09and 0.3apertures .",
    "objects where this difference is greater than 1.3 magnitudes are generally galaxies or blends of stars . this demarcation was determined by starting with a tiny - tim prediction of the ratio of fluxes for a point source measured in those apertures .",
    "we mark objects in the images whose flux growth exceeds that prediction and iterate to arrive at a value which preserves point sources while excluding those with extended radial profiles .",
    "the stellar photometry was corrected for charge - transfer efficiency ( cte hereafter ) effects using the 31 may 2002 version of the dolphin ( 2000 ) equations .",
    "the cte correction amounts to a maximum of @xmath13 mag for faint stars at the top of the chip in fields with the highest background , such as ngc3031 , while reaching @xmath14 mag in fields with low sky background , such as ngc55 .",
    "typically the maximum correction for the data is @xmath15 mag .",
    "transformation of the instrumental magnitudes to standard v and i magnitudes followed the prescriptions of holtzman et al .",
    "first , we have corrected from the foreground extinction using @xmath16 and @xmath17 , then given the instrumental magnitudes , we have determined the standard johnson - cousins magnitudes by solving iteratively the second degree equations relating the wfpc2-to - vi magnitudes using the coefficients tabulated by holtzman et al .",
    "fig.[phot_error ] shows the evolution of the resulting photometric errors for i - band as a function of the apparent magnitude .",
    "the typical trend of increasing photometric errors with apparent magnitude can be seen , where most of the stars observed in the fields are affected by photometric errors of a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "to avoid stellar populations that may bias the analysis of the luminosity function , we have restricted our analysis to stars that match the location of the rgb sequence of metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "to do so , we have retained only stars that are bluer than a certain cut .",
    "for all the galaxies discussed in this paper , the remaining number of red giant stars after the color cut is sufficient for a reliable trgb estimate by the criterion of madore & freedman ( 1995 ) ; i.e. , there are more than 100 stars in the one - magnitude interval fainter than the trgb .",
    "it is worth mentioning that as long as the aim is measurement of the trgb , there is no need to include _ all _ the observed stars to construct the luminosity function .",
    "when the red giant branch is not well populated , metal - rich stars , i.e. , @xmath18 \\ga -0.5}$ ] , that occupy the red part of the cmd where no calibration is available , might make the tip of the red giant branch less well identifiable .",
    "our simple color cut accomplishes this goal , but will lead to different overall luminosity functions for different metallicity distributions .",
    "this is not a problem , provided that the trgb feature itself is clearly visible .",
    "the mean metallicities of halo stellar populations of all our sample galaxies are at or below @xmath18\\la\\,-0.6}$ ] ( see the second paper of this series for more details ) , so any contamination from metal - rich stars is expected to be small .",
    "we used two different methods to detect and to measure the trgb i - band magnitude from the luminosity function of a stellar population . in the following subsections we present briefly our methodology .",
    "the most widely used procedure to estimate the trgb i - band magnitude uses the abrupt termination of the rgb luminosity function at the trgb magnitude .",
    "the trgb discontinuity causes a peak in the first derivative of the observed stellar magnitude distribution ( lee et al .",
    "1993 ; madore & freedman 1995 ) .",
    "sakai et al . ( 1996 ) update this method by gaussian - smoothing the luminosity function to avoid the arbitrary choice of the binning size , and use a continuous edge detection function .    due to the power - law form of the rgb luminosity function",
    ", we use a kernel - smoothed logarithmic luminosity distribution function filtered by a sobel kernel to determine the luminosity of the trgb ; the edge detection function is :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the photometric error , estimated as the mean of photometric errors shown in fig.[phot_error ] , within a bin of @xmath21 magnitude about a magnitude @xmath22 ( sakai et al .",
    "the edge detection filter essentially measures the slope of the luminosity function , and hence it is very sensitive to the noise ; any sudden change in the signal is extremely amplified by the filtering scheme . to suppress any detection of statistically non - significant peaks in the first derivative of the luminosity function",
    ", we apply a weighting scheme to the edge detection filtering output ( sakai et al . 1997 ; mendez et al . 2002 ) .",
    "each @xmath23 is weighted by the poisson noise ( i.e.,@xmath24 ) .",
    "cioni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have found the edge detection technique to be a biased estimator of the trgb magnitude . however , the bias depends on the photometric errors and the amount of smoothing in the luminosity function at the location of the trgb . for our data",
    "set , the bias is less than @xmath25 magnitude ( cioni et al .",
    "2000 ) , much smaller than the random errors ; therefore the distance modulus to the galaxy sample we derive using the edge detection technique would not be significantly affected in a comparison with the maximum likelihood ( see below ) .    to estimate the statistical uncertainty in measuring the @xmath0-band trgb magnitude",
    ", we use bootstrap resampling of the data to generate a large number of samples drawn from the original data set to simulate the act of observing multiple times . using this procedure to quantify the formal errors in measuring the trgb",
    "has the advantage of using the empirical distribution function derived from the data itself , rather than a particular functional form ( e.g. , gaussian ) for the photometric errors .    for each galaxy in our sample , we perform the bootstrap resampling and calculate the statistic of interest @xmath26 ^ 2 $ ] times , where @xmath27 is the number of observed stars within the magnitude range where the luminosity function model is valid in the case of maximum likelihood analysis , and the number of stars used to construct the luminosity function in the case of sobel edge detection analysis .",
    "to this extent the bootstrap version of a statistic s sampling distribution matches the asymptotic sampling distribution ( see babu & feigelson 1996 and efron & tibshirani 1986 for reviews of the theory and application of this technique ) . in these bootstrap samples , the standard deviation of the i - band trgb distribution is taken as the random error in the measurement of the trgb magnitude .",
    "this procedure allows a more robust estimate of the statistical errors than using the full - width at half maximum of the observed peak in the first luminosity function derivative , as usually done ( sakai et al .",
    "1996 ; see also mendez et al .",
    "2002 and cioni et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "an alternative to filtering is to fit models to the data using the technique of maximum likelihood ; this avoids concerns over binning and kernel smoothing .",
    "while theory does not provide strong guidance on the exact functional form of the luminosity function near the trgb , a simple two - power - law model appears to provide a good empirical fit over a restricted range of magnitudes near the trgb itself .",
    "the trgb itself is identified as the break between the two power laws .    in this technique , the underlying luminosity function is treated as a probability distribution function ( pdf ) and we compare relative likelihoods of drawing the observed data set from the model pdfs as we vary the model parameters .",
    "an advantage of this procedure is that no data binning is needed . in practice",
    "we have binned the both the probability distributions and the data in intervals of 0.002 mag , as it simplifies the fitting procedure .    given a model of the stellar distribution on the rgb , @xmath28k , where @xmath29 is the set of free parameters characterizing the model , the likelihood that the observed data set is drawn from this model",
    "is given simply by the product of individual probabilities that star @xmath30 has an observed magnitude @xmath31 within a range @xmath32 :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the individual probability defined as the ratio of the number of stars actually _ observed _ at a given magnitude by the total number of stars expected given a luminosity function model @xmath28 .",
    "photometric errors will affect the magnitude distribution of the observed stars . to account for this , we convolve the intrinsic luminosity function models with an appropriate _ broadening _ function , @xmath35 , to obtain the distribution of _ observed _ magnitudes .",
    "this function describes the probability that a star with an intrinsic magnitude @xmath36 is observed to have the magnitude @xmath37 .",
    "thus the distribution of the observed magnitudes is :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the intrinsic luminosity function model .",
    "we represent the measurement error by a gaussian function with a total dispersion @xmath20 .",
    "that is , we have    @xmath40\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the photometric error at the magnitude @xmath42 .",
    "the probability of observing a star of a magnitude @xmath31 in a magnitude range @xmath32 is simply @xmath43 .",
    "the photometric errors smear the probability to the shape of the error function , centered at @xmath31 ; then the probability becomes @xmath44 .",
    "the photometric errors were determined from artificial star tests .",
    "we take the output of these simulations in 0.5 mag intervals for input stars of a fixed color v - i = 1.0 . in each 0.5 mag interval",
    ", we determine the mean and standard deviation of the residuals of recovered minus input i - band magnitudes . for smearing the model luminosity functions , we use a set of gaussian kernels with the mean and standard deviation that were determined from the simulations and with an overall normalization set by the fractional completeness in that 0.5 mag interval .",
    "the model luminosity functions are convolved with these kernels prior to estimating the logarithm of the likelihood .",
    "the maximum likelihood fitting is restricted to the magnitude range where the effects of both the photometric errors and the incompleteness are not large . to avoid contamination from metal - rich stars that may bias the estimate of the trgb location",
    ", we consider only blue stars , i.e. , stars within the color range @xmath45 ( in practice there are few stars bluer than @xmath46 ) .",
    "ideally , it would be best to fit a curved trgb to a locus of rgb models of all metallicities .",
    "however , in practice the resolution of existing isochrones near the trgb is insufficient for this purpose , and also the isochrones themselves have been constructed via a series of interpolations that become increasingly uncertain near the trgb . for this reason ,",
    "the trgb distance indicator remains an empirical test : a search for a clear jump or inflection in the luminosity function .    to approximate the intrinsic luminosity function @xmath39",
    ", we use a broken power - law model ( cioni et al .",
    "2000 ; mendez et al . 2002 ; gregg et al .",
    "the free parameters characterizing the intrinsic model are the logarithm of the amplitude of the discontinuity at the trgb , the apparent magnitude of the trgb break , and the slopes of luminosity function on either side of the break .",
    "we used both the nelder - mead ( 1965 ) simplex algorithm and `` simulated annealing '' ( e.g. , metropolis , 1953 ; press et al . 1992 ) to determine the best - fit model .",
    "results of the two methods were similar , and well within the uncertainties derived from the subsequent error analysis .    to determine the uncertainties in the trgb magnitude , we have stochastically sampled the full model parameter space by building a monte - carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) using the metropolis - hastings update mechanism .",
    "there is a growing body of literature on this technique ( e.g. , knox , christensen & skordkis 2001 ; verde et al .",
    "2003 ) , which provides an efficient way to characterize the likelihood manifolds in a multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "the metropolis - hastings mcmc algorithm is a restricted random walk through parameter space . at each step in the random",
    "walk , magnitude and direction of the next step is drawn from a normalized `` proposal density '' @xmath47 , where the new state @xmath48 depends only on the current state @xmath49 . the candidate @xmath48 is accepted or rejected with a probability @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the likelihood ratio for state @xmath49 relative to state @xmath48 . after a period of `` burn - in , '' the distribution of locations in parameter space sampled by the chain converges to the `` posterior distribution '' @xmath52 .",
    "thus likelihood contours can be constructed simply by drawing contours of the density of points sampled by the chain .    for our proposal distribution",
    ", we have used a gaussian with @xmath53 in all of the fit parameters .",
    "we have also restricted the chains to operate within a `` reasonable '' range of parameter space : break amplitudes within a factor of 100 of the best fit , trgb magnitudes within 1.5 - 2 mag of the best fit , and lf slopes between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the chains were burned in for 1000 steps , and then 10000 steps were used to sample the posterior distributions .",
    "the probability distributions thus derived are shown in the lower - right panels of figures 3 - 6 .",
    "we have verified that the results are insensitive to small changes in the range of magnitudes being fit and the parameters used to define the mcmc .",
    "the confidence intervals ( and indeed the best fit values ) are nevertheless subject to a number of implicit prior assumptions .",
    "these include the assumption that the distribution can be adequately described by two power laws with a break , over the full magnitude range being fit . in practice",
    ", we do see small but significant differences in the confidence intervals as we change the magnitude limits and color limits",
