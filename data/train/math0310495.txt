    ". then @xmath51 .",
    "the boundary of each component of @xmath52 contains a component of @xmath53 , and this gives a bijective correspondence between components of @xmath52 and components of @xmath53 .",
    "we notice that @xmath54 is connected . indeed , by complete invariance of @xmath12 , we have @xmath55 , so every two points @xmath56 and @xmath57 in @xmath54 can be connected by a curve @xmath58 in @xmath12 , so that @xmath58 does not pass through the critical points of @xmath0 .",
    "the image @xmath59 of this curve begins and ends in @xmath39 , and does not pass through the critical values of @xmath0 . by a small perturbation of @xmath58 we achieve",
    "that @xmath59 does not pass through asymptotic values .",
    "using the fact that @xmath60 is a covering and that @xmath61 , we can deform @xmath58 into a curve in @xmath54 which still connects @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this proves that the @xmath54 are connected .",
    "it follows that @xmath54 is unbounded , as it contains infinitely many preimages of a generic point in @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that the boundary of each component @xmath62 of @xmath52 intersects the julia set .    for each component @xmath62 of @xmath52 ,",
    "the intersection @xmath63 is a component @xmath64 of @xmath53 .",
    "this component @xmath64 divides the plane into two parts , one containing @xmath54 and the other containing @xmath62 .",
    "we conclude that every component of @xmath53 is unbounded , because @xmath54 is unbounded , and @xmath65 intersects the julia set which is unbounded and connected by lemma 1 .",
    "( a similar argument for unboundedness of each component of @xmath53 was given in @xcite ) .",
    "for every component @xmath64 of @xmath53 , the component of @xmath66 that contains @xmath62 intersects the julia set . since the julia set is connected by lemma  1 , we conclude that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are connected .",
    "so the map ( [ 1 ] ) is a universal covering by a connected set @xmath53 , for each @xmath34 .",

    "next we note that the set @xmath71 separates the sphere into three simply connected regions .",

    "so @xmath103 is a ramified covering , continuous up to the boundary .",
    "furthermore , the boundary map is a local homeomorphism .",
    "as each point of @xmath104 has only one preimage on @xmath105 , we conclude that ( [ 2 ] ) is a homeomorphism .",
    "now it follows that the restriction @xmath106 is a homeomorphism and @xmath107 it follows that there are no critical points over @xmath75 , so @xmath75 is not a critical value .",
    "if @xmath75 were an asymptotic value , there would be a curve @xmath108 in @xmath72 which tends to infinity , and such that @xmath109 as @xmath110 .",
    "but this curve @xmath108 would intersect infinitely many of the curves @xmath90 , so its image @xmath111 would intersect @xmath82 infinitely many times , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath111 tends to @xmath75 .",
    "this completes the proof of ( ii ) .",
    "the proof actually shows that @xmath112 is a universal covering , a fact which we will use later .    to prove ( iii ) , let us assume that @xmath21 contains two asymptotic values , or that @xmath113 has two unbounded components for some asymptotic value @xmath114 .",
    "then there exists a curve @xmath115 , tending to infinity in both directions , such that @xmath116 has limits as @xmath117 , @xmath118 , in both directions , where these limits are the two asymptotic values in the first case , and where both limits are equal to @xmath14 in the second case , but the two tails of the curve @xmath108 are in different components of @xmath113 .",
    "now one of the regions , say @xmath119 , into which @xmath108 partitions the plane does not intersect the julia set @xmath23 ( because @xmath23 is connected by lemma  [ lemma1 ] ) , and thus @xmath120 .",
    "we want to conclude that @xmath0 has a limit as @xmath117 in @xmath119 .    to do this , we choose an arbitrary point @xmath121 and consider the function @xmath122 which is holomorphic and bounded in @xmath21 .",
    "this function has limits when @xmath117 , @xmath118 , so by a theorem of lindelf @xcite , these limits coincide and @xmath123 has a limit as @xmath117 in @xmath119 .",

    "these crosscuts meet at two poles of @xmath138 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 4 ] ) that the diameter ( with respect to the metric @xmath130 ) of every component of @xmath137 is at most @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is a constant .",

    "we note that @xmath269 is connected for sufficiently small @xmath270 , and thus @xmath268 is completely invariant .    since @xmath262",

    "it follows from part ( iv ) of our theorem that the julia set of @xmath0 is a jordan curve .",
    "on the other hand we note that if @xmath284 with @xmath285 , then @xmath286 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath287 , then @xmath288 and thus @xmath289 , if @xmath210 is large enough . thus the julia set of @xmath0 is contained in the domain @xmath290 if @xmath210 is large enough .",

    "it follows that the julia set @xmath319 coincides with the real line , and thus @xmath320 .    to get an example @xmath0 where",
    "the upper and lower half - plane are superattracting basins , we note that @xmath123 can be chosen such that @xmath321 has a non - real zero @xmath322 , and with @xmath323 and @xmath324 the function @xmath325 satisfies @xmath326 and @xmath327 , as well as @xmath328 and @xmath329 .",

    "* our final example has two completely invariant half - planes , but unlike @xmath337 , it has no asymptotic values .",
    "another feature of this example is that it has minimal possible growth among the functions of class @xmath5 , namely @xmath338 where @xmath210 is the nevanlinna characteristic .",

    ", @xmath123 has an analytic continuation to the half - strip @xmath348 and maps this half - strip into the left half - plane .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath123 is an elliptic function .    the composite function @xmath349 maps the positive ray into itself , and applying the reflection again",
