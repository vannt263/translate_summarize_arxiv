    "magnetic fields play a crucial role in determining the evolution of many relativistic objects . in a companion paper ( baumgarte & shapiro , 2002 , hereafter paper i ) we assembled the complete set of maxwell  einstein  magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations that determine the self - consistent evolution of a relativistic , ideal mhd gas in a dynamical spacetime .",
    "our goal was to set down a formulation of the equations that is suitable for numerical integration in full @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "in this paper ( hereafter paper ii ) we use these general relativistic mhd equations to follow the gravitational collapse of a magnetized star to a black hole .",
    "we solve this problem in a `` dynamical cowling approximation '' , whereby the matter and gravitational field are given by the oppenheimer - sndyer solution ( oppenheimer & snyder 1939 ) for the collapse from rest of a spherical dust ball to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we assume that initially the star is threaded by a dipole magnetic field and determine the subsequent evolution of the magnetic and electric fields with time , both in the matter interior and vacuum exterior .",
    "we are motivated to tackle this problem partly to acclimate ourselves to the task of numerically integrating the coupled maxwell - einstein - relativistic mhd equations for a strong - field , dynamical spacetime . though the background geometry is entirely determined in this example , the spacetime is highly dynamical and characterized by a very strong ( black hole ) gravitational field .",
    "the goal is to solve for the electromagnetic fields to arbitrary late times everywhere in space .",
    "the restricted problem we pose here is sufficiently rich to allow a comparison of coordinate gauge choices for handling collapse to a black hole and dealing with the accompanying spacetime singularity .",
    "such gauge choices range from `` singularity avoiding '' time coordinates to horizon penetrating time slices which allow for black hole excision .",
    "we experiment with these different choices below .",
    "the collapse of a magnetized star to a black hole is an astrophysically important problem that has been discussed previously .",
    "some of the earliest treatments were based on a quasi - static approach ( ginzburg & ozernoy 1965 ; anderson & cohen 1970 ; zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) which was demonstrated to give the incorrect asymptotic decay of the fields with time ( price 1972a , b ; see also thorne 1971 ) .",
    "the general problem of magnetic star collapse to a black role obviously requires a detailed numerical treatment for solution of the coupled maxwell  einstein  relativistic mhd system .",
    "only now is such a treatment feasible .",
    "in fact , we are unaware of any previous analysis that determines the complete evolution of both the interior _ and _ exterior electromagnetic fields during stellar collapse to a black hole , even for the restricted spherical collapse problem posed here . [ in a pioneering paper , wilson 1975 used relativistic mhd to follow the collapse of the interior of a magnetized star , but treated the gravitational field as quasi - stationary ]",
    ". our solution should serve as a useful testbed for designing codes capable of handling more complicated scenarios involving relativistic mhd gravitational collapse .",
    "such scenarios may play a crucial role in determining the outcome of stellar core collapse in a supernova , the fate of a hypermassive , differentially rotating remnant of a binary neutron star merger ( baumgarte , shapiro & shibata 2000 ; shapiro 2000 ) , the generation of gamma - ray bursts via the collapse of rotating massive stars to black holes ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , and the collapse of supermassive stars to supermassive black holes ( see , e.g. , rees 1984 , baumgarte & shapiro 1999 , new & shapiro 2001 , and references therein . )    this paper is partitioned as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we present a brief overview of magnetized oppenheimer - snyder collapse , and in section [ sec3 ] we provide a review of the matter and metric fields . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we derive analytic newtonian and relativistic solutions for the interior electromagnetic fields , and in section [ sec5 ] we set up maxwell s equations and boundary conditions for determining the exterior fields . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we provide electrodynamic initial data , both for the interior and the exterior . in section [ sec7 ]",
    "we present numerical results for the evolution of the exterior fields in three different time slices .",
    "in particular , in section [ sec7.4 ] we present results in kerr - schild coordinates , which allow us to follow the evolution to arbitrary late times and to track the late - time fall - off of the fields .",
    "we briefly summarize our analysis in section [ sec8 ] .",
    "we also provide two appendices .",
    "appendix [ seca ] derives a global electromagnetic energy conservation criterion , and appendix [ secb ] contains the finite - difference equations used in our simulations .",
    "in this paper we consider the `` simplest '' case of magnetized stellar collapse to a black hole : the collapse of a spherically symmetric , homogeneous dustball , momentarily at rest at @xmath1 . the matter and gravitational fields",
    "are described by the exact oppenheimer - snyder solution .",
    "we solve for the electrodynamic fields in a `` dynamical cowling approximation '' : the background geometry is dynamical and determined by the imploding matter field alone ; the matter and the geometry ( metric ) are unaffected by the electrodynamic fields , which are evolved in the unperturbed background .",
    "our approximation is physically applicable whenever the magnetic field is sufficiently weak that it satisfies the condition @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gravitational constant , @xmath4 is the matter density and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and radius of the star .",
    "note that for a frozen - in b - field , both terms scale the same way with radius ( i.e. @xmath7 ) during the collapse , so if the inequality is satisfied initially , it is satisfied at all later times .",
    "we seek the relativistic generalization of the solution for the electromagnetic field generated inside and outside a collapsing , homogeneous , perfectly conducting magnetized dust sphere which at @xmath1 is threaded by a constant interior b - field , matched onto an exterior magnetic dipole field .",
    "the solution to this problem requires a numerical integration of maxwell s equations in a dynamical spacetime in which a black hole forms .",
    "while various aspects of this problem have been treated previously , including the asymptotic field behavior at late times in a static vacuum schwarzschild spacetime , the full dynamical solution has never been presented .",
    "we will divide our time - dependent solution of the electrodynamic fields into two domains : the matter interior solution ( section [ sec4 ] ) and vacuum exterior solution ( section [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "the solutions are joined at the stellar surface by applying the junction conditions for an electromagnetic field across a moving discontinuity .",
    "hereafter we adopt gravitational units whereby @xmath8 .",

    "we assume the interior of the collapsing dust ball to be perfectly conducting , in which case the electric field vanishes in the comoving frame , @xmath34 and the magnetic field can be treated in the ideal magnetohydrodynamics approximation .",

    "this problem provides an ideal laboratory for experimenting with various coordinate gauge choices for performing numerical integrations in strong gravitational fields .",
    "we will compare three different time slicings for treating the exterior evolution , namely schwarzschild , maximal and kerr - schild .",
    "historically , the earliest numerical studies traditionally worked in the schwarzschild gauge when dealing with spherical , asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "but in this gauge the time coordinate approaches infinity as the stellar surface reaches the black hole event horizon at areal radius @xmath163 ; light cones pinch off near the horizon and the resulting coordinate singularities make integration of the electromagnetic field equations to arbitrarily late times difficult in this gauge .",
    "maximal time slicing has often been adopted in recent numerical work as a `` singularity avoiding '' gauge ; spatial slices cover the entire matter interior as well as the vacuum exterior and penetrate the horizon .",
    "but `` grid stretching '' along the black hole throat ( see , e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1986 ) as the stellar surface approaches a limiting surface inside the horizon makes the solution increasingly inaccurate at late times .",
    "maximal time slicing requires the numerical solution of a second order elliptic equation for the lapse .",
    "while boundary conditions on this equation are straightforward to impose at the stellar origin and at large distances from the matter field , they are not at all simple to impose at a black hole horizon .",
    "consequently , it is not straightforward in this gauge to `` excise '' the black hole interior from the computational grid , even though this region ( where inaccuracies are growing ) is causally disconnected from the exterior .",
    "these problems can be avoided in kerr - schild slicing , where the lapse is nonzero on the horizon ( unlike schwarzschild but like maximal ) and analytic ( like schwarzschild but unlike maximal ) .",
    "these features allow for horizon penetration and `` black hole excision '' ( unruh , unpublished ; thornburg 1987 ; seidel & suen 1992 ) to follow the evolution of the electromagnetic fields outside the black hole to arbitrary late times .      in the earliest attempts to calculate the exterior magnetic field of a magnetized star undergoing stellar collapse",
    "it was assumed that the exterior field is a ( longitudinal ) dipole field which changes _ quasi - statically _ during the entire collapse . in this approximation ,",
    "the electric field and the time derivative of the magnetic field is neglected , and the exterior magnetic field is given , at all times , by equations ( [ brext ] )  ( [ bthetaext ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field strength is determined by the magnetic dipole moment @xmath153 , which can be found from equation ( [ mu_d ] ) . as the stellar surface @xmath164 approaches the horizon , the magnetic dipole moment approaches zero according to @xmath165 during this late phase of the collapse we have @xmath166 ( see , e.g.  problem 15.11 in lightman et al .",
    "1975 ) . together ,",
    "these imply @xmath167 suggesting that the exterior magnetic field should decay with @xmath168 at late times ( see , e.g. , ginzburg & ozernoy 1965 ; anderson & cohen 1970 ; zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) .",
    "this result is incorrect , since the time - changing magnetic dipole in the collapsing star generates a transverse electromagnetic field ( @xmath169 and @xmath140 ) , which dominates the late - time behavior but is ignored in this quasi - static approximation .",

    "the schwarzschild coordinate time @xmath32 can also be found in terms of @xmath13 according to @xmath177 ( see , e.g.  misner , thorne & wheeler 1973 , eqn .",
    "note that we have @xmath178 as the stellar surface approaches the event horizon , @xmath179 .",

    "we regrid after each timestep so that the stellar surface is always located half - way between the two first grid - points ( which makes the implementation of the boundary conditions ( [ a_inner_condition ] ) and ( [ e_inner_condition ] ) particularly simple ) .",
    "the advantage of implicit schemes is that no courant condition has to be satisfied to maintain stability of the numerical integration . because of the linearity of maxwell s equations the initial field strength @xmath181 is arbitrary ( provided it is dynamically unimportant ) and can , without loss of generality , be chosen to be unity .    in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ]",
    "we show numerical results for a star collapsing from rest from an initial radius of @xmath182 . in these snapshots",
    "we show the collapsing star together with exterior magnetic field lines . in axisymmetry",
    ", these field lines coincide with contours of constant @xmath87 ( zhang 1989 ) , which enables us to draw them easily . at @xmath1",
    "all field lines are attached to fluid interior and emerge from the stellar surface . at later times , as the surface approaches the event horizon , field lines that emerge from the surface are crushed against the star and become increasingly tangential ( anderson & cohen 1970 ) . at larger separations , field lines detach from the star during the collapse . in the radiation zone , these disjoint lines propagate outwards with the speed of light .",
    "thus , early on , we find that the exterior longitudinal @xmath140 field evolves quasi - statically to match the growth of the frozen - in interior field ( see equation  ( [ bintsol ] ) ) , while the exterior @xmath169 field remains small . at late times , the exterior longitudinal fields are radiated away and the dominant @xmath140 and @xmath169 fields become outgoing , decaying , transverse electromagnetic waves .    to calibrate the accuracy of the numerical integration we check the global conservation of magnetic energy as outlined in appendix [ seca ] .",
    "we show results of this energy conservation test in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "clearly , the accuracy deteriorates soon after the surface of the star approaches the event horizon at around @xmath183 .",
    "this effect is not surprising .",
    "the vanishing of the lapse  ( [ alpha_ss ] ) on the horizon causes the local light cone to `` pinch off '' and the ( coordinate ) speed of light to go to zero . as a consequence , incoming radiation piles up in front of the horizon and develops smaller and smaller spatial structures , which ultimately become smaller than any fixed grid resolution ( cf .",

    "it is evident that schwarzschild coordinates are not suitable for calculating the late - time radiation as measured by a distant observer , and , hence , for determining the late - time electromagnetic field decay rate .",
    "this observation motivates using a coordinate system that is regular on the event horizon and extends smoothly into the black hole interior .",
    "= 5.5 in    = 5.5 in    we now follow the same collapse but adopt maximal time slicing and isotropic ( minimal shear ) spatial coordinates .",
    "this coordinate system extends regularly into the black hole .",
    "maximal slicing is imposed by requiring the trace of the extrinsic curvature to vanish at all times : @xmath184 taking the trace of equation ( i.2.8 ) then yields an elliptic equation for @xmath78 , which in general has to be solved numerically .",

    "differential equations .",
    "solutions are presented in petrich , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1985 ) and provide @xmath78 , @xmath173 and @xmath12 , which we substitute in equations ( [ edot1 ] ) and ( [ adot1 ] ) for the evolution of @xmath104 and @xmath103 .",
    "these coordinates cover both the interior and the exterior of the star , so that we can map out the interior as well as the exterior field on these slices .",
    "the lorentz factor between a normal observer and a comoving observer at the stellar surface @xmath185 can be computed from the numerical solution presented in petrich , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1985 ) ( i.e. , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is given by equation ( 6.11 ) of that paper ) .",
    "this is the velocity that is needed in the boundary condition ( [ e_inner_condition ] ) .",
    "we numerically solve equations ( [ edot1 ] ) and ( [ adot1 ] ) on maximal slices using implicit finite difference equations that are identical in form to those used on schwarzschild slices ( see appendix [ secb ] ) .    in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ]",
    "we show snapshots of the collapse in maximal slicing . unlike schwarzschild slices and the kerr - schild slices below ,",
    "maximal slicing also covers the matter interior , which allows us to trace the interior magnetic field lines as well as locate the apparent and event horizons in these plots .",
    "we can also identify the limit surface at @xmath189 which the matter surface approaches at late times ( petrich , shapiro & teukolsky 1985 ) . note that in the interior , a field line must connect the same lagrangian fluid element at all times to satisfy the `` frozen - in '' requirement of mhd .",
    "this criterion provides a check on our field line tracer . for comoving observers in the interior , the electric field vanishes , but",
    "as viewed by a normal observer in maximal slicing the electric field is non - vanishing in general ( see section [ sec5.2.1 ] for the transformation ) .",
    "in maximal slicing the metric is not static , so that we can not simply apply the electromagnetic energy conservation check developed in appendix [ seca ] .",
    "maximal slicing has some very desirable properties , but at late times grid stretching effects make the computation even of the background models increasingly difficult ( shapiro & teukolsky 1986 ) .",
    "we terminated the calculation shortly after @xmath190 .",
    "the problems of maximal slicing can be avoided by using kerr - schild ( or ingoing eddington - finkelstein ) coordinates , which are analytic but smoothly extend across the horizon .",
    "this slicing is not `` singularity avoiding '' , so that it requires that the interior of a black hole be excised from the numerical grid .",
    "adopting horizon - penetrating coordinate systems together with black hole excision is currently the most promising approach to dynamical simulations of black holes . in this calculation",
    "we apply this approach to the collapse of a magnetized star . since the metric in kerr - schild coordinates ( equation ( [ metric_ks ] ) below ) takes a form that is different from ( [ metric_isotropic ] ) , several parts of the above calculations , including the form of maxwell s equations , boundary conditions and initial data , have to be modified .      in kerr - schild coordinates ,",

    "this also demonstrates the necessity of excising the black hole interior , since otherwise the central singularity would be encountered after @xmath214 .",
    "the lorentz factor corresponding to a boost from an observer comoving with the stellar surface to a local normal observer can be found from @xmath215 the relative velocity @xmath107 of the normal observer as measured by a comoving observer at the surface is then given by @xmath216 a minus sign appears in equation  ( [ v_ks ] ) because the shift drives the radial velocity of normal observer inward more rapidly than the surface .",

    "we note that even at @xmath1 the electric field is non - vanishing as seen by a normal observer in kerr - schild coordinates , since a normal observer is moving with respect to a static observer .",
    "in section [ sec5.1 ] we evaluated maxwell s equations ( [ adot1 ] ) and ( [ edot1 ] ) for a metric of the form ( [ metric_isotropic ] ) .",

    "we typically set @xmath229 , but the results are insensitive to the choice provided @xmath228 is well inside the horizon at @xmath230 .",
    "once we have switched to an excision boundary condition , we fix the numerical grid so that @xmath228 is located half - way between the first two gridpoints .",
    "we have experimented with a number of different excision boundary conditions , but found , as expected , that the exact implementation had hardly any effect on the results in the exterior of the black hole , as long as @xmath228 is far enough inside the event horizon . following a similar approach by alcubierre & brgmann ( 2001 ) for dynamical black hole simulations , we settled on simply copying the values of @xmath104 and @xmath103 from the second gridpoint to the first at every timestep , which is equivalent to imposing @xmath231 ( see equations ( [ b_inner_bc_a ] ) and ( [ b_inner_bc_b ] ) ) .",
    "we have implemented the evolution equations ( [ edot_ks ] ) and ( [ adot_ks ] ) using both implicit and explicit finite difference methods ( see appendix [ secb ] for the finite difference equations ) .",

    "since the kerr - schild metric ( [ metric_ks ] ) is independent of time , we can calibrate the performance of the code with the same global electromagnetic energy conservation test as we did in schwarzschild coordinates ( section [ sec7.2 ] ) .",
    "the necessary expressions can be found in appendix [ seca ] .",
    "we show results for the energy conservation check in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "it is quite obvious that this integration works much better than that in schwarzschild coordinates ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] ) , due to regularity across the horizon .",
    "we can follow the electromagnetic fields to arbitrary late times , and can track the late - time behavior reliably .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] also shows that about 80% of the energy contained in the initial magnetic field is absorbed by the black hole , while about 20% of the radiation is emitted in an electromagnetic wavepacket .    in figures [ fig7 ] through [ fig9 ]",
    "we show snapshots of magnetic field lines for a star collapsing from @xmath232 as viewed in three different regions .",
    "it can be seen very clearly how the collapse of the magnetized star emits a pulse of electromagnetic radiation , which travels to infinity at the speed of light .",
    "similar behavior is seen in plots of the electric field at late times .",
    "we can now evaluate the late - time fall - off of the electromagnetic fields . in figures [ fig10 ] through [ fig12 ]",
    "we show the values of @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 at @xmath236 as a function of time . as expected , the fields are nearly constant up to @xmath190 .",
    "once the collapse gets underway , the exterior longitudinal field starts to evolve to match the increasing interior frozen - in field .",
    "soon after @xmath237 , the first electromagnetic pulse induced by the collapse passes the observer at @xmath238 .",
    "sign changes in the field appear as down - ward spikes in the plots .",
    "after @xmath239 , the exterior fields are predominantly characterized by a decaying dipole with a power - law fall - off with time . in figures",
    "[ fig10 ] through [ fig12 ] we have plotted the power - laws curves varying like @xmath240 to which the fields approach for late times .",
    "this finding for the exterior fields agrees with the general results of price ( 1972a , b ; cf .",
    "thorne , 1971 ) who showed that multipole electromagnetic fields scattering off a static schwarzschild black hole should decay as @xmath170 .",
    "measurement of the wavelength of the late - time outgoing electromagnetic waves provides further verification of our numerical integrations .",
    "we find that the wavelength satisfies @xmath241 .",
    "this is the value of a quasi - normal mode for electromagnetic dipole radiation scattering off a static schwarzschild black hole ( ferrari & mashhoon 1984 ) .",
    "this finding shows that the late - time radiation is ringing radiation that has a frequency determined by the mass of the hole and is independent of the initial electromagnetic field profile .",
    "we have solved for the evolution in general relativity of the electromagnetic field of a magnetic star that collapses from rest to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we adopted a `` dynamical cowling '' model by which the matter and gravitational field are prescribed by the oppenheimer - snyder solution for spherical collapse .",
    "starting from maxwell s equations in @xmath0 form , we solved for the magnetic and electric fields both in the vacuum exterior and the stellar interior .",
    "we assumed that the initial star was threaded by a dipole magnetic field and that the interior behaves as an mhd fluid .",
    "we showed how the electromagnetic junction conditions could be applied at the stellar surface in order that the fields in the mhd interior , which were determined analytically , could be matched to the fields in the vacuum exterior .",
    "the exterior fields were evolved numerically .    to gain experience with solving maxwell s equations numerically in a dynamical spacetime containing both matter and a black hole ,",
    "we solved the above problem in three different coordinate gauges : schwarzschild , maximal and kerr - schild .",
    "while the first two coordinate systems have singularity avoiding properties , they both lead to growing numerical inaccuracies in the exterior as the surface approaches the horizon ( in the case of schwarzschild time slicing ) or a limit surface inside the horizon ( in the case of maximal slicing ) at late times .",
    "kerr - schild slicing is horizon penetrating and does not suffer from grid stretching ; accordingly this slicing enables us to apply excision boundary conditions once the star collapses inside the horizon .",
    "adopting kerr - schild slicing coordinates with black hole excision allowed us to integrate maxwell s equations to arbitrary late times .",
    "we followed the transition in the exterior of a quasi - static , longitudinal magnetic field , which evolved during the collapse in to match the growing frozen - in interior field , to a transverse electromagnetic wave . by the end of the simulation ,",
    "the electromagnetic field energy in the near zone outside the black hole had either been captured by the hole or radiated away to large distances , in accord with the `` no - hair theorem '' . at late times",
    "we recovered the expected power - law decay of the dipole fields with time , as well as the expected wavelength of the ringdown radiation .",
    "there exist a number of very important astrophysical problems which require the solution of the coupled maxwell - einstein - mhd equations in a strong , dynamical gravitational field .",
    "for example , learning the outcome of rotating stellar core or supermassive star collapse , the mechanism for gamma - ray bursts , and/or the fate of the remnant of a binary neutron star merger may all require solving this coupled system of equations .",
    "the solution we have presented for our simple collapse scenario should serve as a preliminary guide to the design and testing of more sophisticated codes capable of handling these more complicated scenarios .",
