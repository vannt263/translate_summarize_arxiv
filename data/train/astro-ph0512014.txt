    "inflation @xcite generates tensor perturbations ( gravitational waves ) with a nearly scale - invariant primordial power spectrum @xcite .",
    "this gravitational - wave background ( gwb ) contributes to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy @xcite , and also produces a characteristic curl ( or `` b - mode '' ) fingerprint in the cmb polarization @xcite .",
    "several cmb experiments are being developed to pursue this signal @xcite .",
    "the gwb also persists as a sea of relic gravitational radiation filling the universe today @xcite .",
    "direct detection of this relic radiation has received considerable attention over the past year or so , since it has been realized that space - based laser interferometers operating in the frequency range @xmath3 might achieve the necessary sensitivity and foreground subtraction @xcite . in particular ,",
    "two futuristic experiments have been proposed  nasa s `` big bang observer '' ( bbo ) and the japanese `` deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory '' ( decigo )  and are currently being investigated @xcite .",
    "the gravitational wave spectrum generated by inflation carries important information about the conditions during inflation .",
    "but the spectrum also receives corrections , both large and small , from the subsequent evolution and matter content of the universe after inflation . in this paper , we identify various post - inflationary physical effects which modify the gwb , and show how they may be encoded in the gravitational - wave transfer function that relates the primordial tensor power spectrum to the gravitational - wave spectrum at a later point in cosmic history .",
    "it is necessary to properly understand and disentangle the post - inflationary effects in order to optimally extract the inflationary information in the gwb .",
    "but these modifications are also interesting in their own right , since they offer a rare window onto the physical properties of the high - energy universe during the `` primordial dark age '' between the end of inflation and the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the same features that make the inflationary gwb difficult to detect  namely its small amplitude and gravitational - strength coupling to matter  also make it a clean cosmological probe .",
    "first , because of their tiny amplitude , the gravitational waves obey linear equations of motion , so that their evolution may be predicted analytically with high precision .",
    "( by contrast , density perturbations grow after horizon entry , and perturbations shorter than @xmath4  mpc have already grown non - linear ; so it is impossible to study their evolution analytically , and even numerical analysis is challenging . ) second , because of their ultra - weak interactions with matter , the gravitational waves have been free streaming since the end of inflation  in contrast to neutrinos ( which began streaming roughly a second later ) and photons ( which began streaming several hundred thousand years later ) .",
    "the gravitational waves carry unsullied information from the early universe , and subsequent modifications of the gravitational - wave spectrum are not washed out by thermal effects ( since the gravitons are thermally decoupled ) .",
    "the gravitational - wave spectrum near a given wavenumber @xmath0 is primarily sensitive to two `` moments '' in cosmic history : ( 1 ) the moment when that mode `` left the horizon '' ( _ i.e. _ , became longer than the instantaneous hubble radius during inflation ) , and ( 2 ) the moment when the mode `` re - entered the horizon '' ( _ i.e. _ , became shorter than the instantaneous hubble radius once again , after the end of inflation ) .",
    "the first moment imprints information about inflation itself , while the second moment imprints information about post - inflationary conditions .",
    "the cmb is sensitive to long - wavelength modes that re - entered at relatively low temperatures ( well after bbn ) , corresponding to relatively well - understood physics .",
    "by contrast , laser interferometers are sensitive to shorter wavelengths that entered the horizon at high temperatures ( @xmath5  gev ) , well above the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the physical conditions at such high energies , which are considerably beyond the reach of particle accelerators , are a mystery , so that any information about this epoch from the gwb would be very valuable .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ fundamentals ] , we review the basics of inflationary gravitational waves .",
    "we take special care to clearly establish our conventions , and to point out where conventions diverge and become confused in the literature . in section [ transfer_fn ]",
    "we present a new calculation of the gravitational - wave transfer function which includes effects not considered in previous calculations @xcite .",
    "we separate the transfer function into three factors , each with a distinct physical meaning .    the first factor accounts for the redshift - suppression of the gravitational - wave amplitude after horizon re - entry .",
    "among other things , this factor accomodates a dark energy component with a time - varying equation - of - state parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the second factor captures the behavior of the background equation - of - state parameter @xmath6 near the time of horizon re - entry .",
    "the third factor accounts for the damping of tensor modes due to tensor anisotropic stress from free - streaming relativistic particles in the early universe .",
    "this damping effect was recently pointed out by weinberg @xcite , and the damping on cmb scales due to free - streaming neutrinos has been studied in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we stress that it is also necessary to consider this damping effect on laser - interferometer scales , which re - entered the horizon when free - streaming particles were an unknown fraction @xmath7 of the background energy density .",
    "we present accurate expressions for the damping effect as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "we also observe that weinberg s analysis , which originally focused on a single fermionic particle ( the neutrino ) , extends in a simple way to the more general case of a mixture of free - streaming bosons and fermions with different temperatures and decoupling times .",
    "we identify six physical effects which can modify the relic gwb by causing the equation - of - state parameter @xmath6 to deviate from its standard value ( @xmath2 ) during the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "furthermore , although it is often treated as a stationary random process , the inflationary gwb is actually highly non - stationary ( as emphasized by grishchuk @xcite ; also see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our transfer function keeps track of the coherent phase information that it contains . finally , in section [ discussion ]",
    ", we discuss the implications of these results for future cmb and laser - interferometer experiments , and consider what we might learn by measuring the gwb in both ways .",
    "in this section , we derive some basic facts about inflationary gravitational waves .",
    "these derivations are not new , but are intended to make the present paper more pedagogical and self - contained .",
    "they also establish our conventions explicitly , and provide a brief guide to conventions used by other authors .",
    "such a guide is necessary since there are many slightly different conventions floating around in the inflationary gravitational - wave literature and , as a result , erroneous factors of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are ubiquitous .",
    "we have been careful to highlight each spot where convention choices crop up , and to state which convention we have chosen .",

    "@xcite ) , some authors define the tensor perturbation with an extra factor of @xmath8 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) so that the spatial metric is written @xmath14 . throughout this appendix , if a term contains a repeated index , that index should be summed : from 1 to 3 for latin indices and from 0 to 3 for greek indices .",
    "the perturbation @xmath13 is symmetric ( @xmath15 ) , traceless ( @xmath16 ) , and transverse ( @xmath17 ) , and therefore contains @xmath18 independent modes ( corresponding to the `` @xmath19 '' and `` @xmath20 '' gravitational - wave polarizations )",
    ".    one can think of @xmath21 as a quantum field in an unperturbed frw background metric @xmath22 . at quadratic order in @xmath13 ( which is adequate , since @xmath13 is tiny ) ,",
    "tensor perturbations are governed by the action ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23.\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the inverse and determinant of @xmath26 , respectively , and @xmath27 is newton s constant .",

    "note that consistency between the two sets of commutation relations , ( [ h_pi_commutators ] ) and ( [ a_commutators ] ) , requires that the mode functions satisfy the wronskian normalization condition @xmath61 in the past . in particular , the standard initial condition for the mode function in the far past ( when the mode @xmath0 was still far inside the horizon during inflation ) : @xmath62 satisfies ( [ wronskian ] )",
    " but it is not the unique initial condition which does so .",
    "this is a manifestation of the well known vacuum ambiguity that is responsible for particle production in cosmological spacetimes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now that we have discussed the quantization of tensor perturbations , let us turn to the three different spectra that are commonly used to describe the stochastic gwb : the tensor power spectrum @xmath63 , the chirp amplitude @xmath64 , and the energy spectrum @xmath65 .    in the early universe ,",
    "the gwb is usually characterized by the tensor power spectrum @xmath63 . with the formalism developed thus far",
    ", one can check that @xmath66 so that the tensor power spectrum is given by @xmath67 note that our definition ( [ def_tensor_power ] ) agrees with the wmap convention ( see @xcite )  this will be clearer when we present the approximate slow - roll form of the spectrum below .",
    "although the wmap convention seems to be becoming the standard one , several other definitions of the tensor power spectrum exist in the literature , and differ from ( [ def_tensor_power ] ) by an overall numerical constant . also , since ( [ def_tensor_power ] ) defines the tensor power spectrum in terms of the full tensor perturbation @xmath13 , the normalization of the power spectrum is independent of the normalization ( [ basis_norm ] ) of the polarization basis .",
    "by contrast , some authors define the tensor power spectrum in terms of the polarization components of @xmath13 , so that the normalization of the spectrum is linked to the convention - dependent coefficient on the right - hand side of ( [ basis_norm ] ) .",
    "the present - day gwb is usually characterized either by its chirp amplitude @xmath64 , or by its energy spectrum @xmath65 .",
    "first , the chirp amplitude represents the rms dimensionless strain ( @xmath68 in a gravitational wave antenna ) per logarithmic wavenumber interval ( or logarithmic frequency interval ) , and is related to the tensor power spectrum as follows : @xmath69 ( see @xcite for more details ) . the energy spectrum @xmath70 represents the gravitational - wave energy density ( @xmath71 ) per logarithmic wavenumber interval , in units of the `` critical density '' @xmath72 to compute @xmath65",
    ", we can again think of the tensor perturbation @xmath13 as a field in an unperturbed frw background metric @xmath26 , and then use its action ( [ tensor_action ] ) to compute its stress - energy tensor @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the lagrangian function in ( [ tensor_action ] )  see , for example , ch .",

    "also note that , once the mode @xmath0 re - enters the horizon after inflation , the corresponding mode function obeys @xmath81 , as explained in the next section , so that the three spectra may be related to one another in a simple way : @xmath82    next , let us `` derive '' the slow - roll expression for the primordial tensor power spectrum . as long as @xmath0 remains inside the hubble horizon ( @xmath83 ) during inflation , the mode function @xmath84 is given by ( [ h_bc ] ) ; and once @xmath0 is outside the horizon ( @xmath85 ) , the mode function @xmath86 is independent of @xmath11",

    "thus , the primordial tensor power spectrum is given by @xmath93 where , in this equation ( and in the remainder of this section ) `` @xmath94 '' denotes a definition , `` @xmath95 '' indicates that the slow - roll approximation has been used , and @xmath96 is the `` reduced planck mass . ''",
    "note that the primordial power spectrum is time - independent , since ( by definition ) it is evaluated when the mode @xmath0 is far outside the horizon .",
    "although our derivation of ( [ tensor_power_slowroll ] ) may seem crude , it is well known that ( [ tensor_power_slowroll ] ) provides a very good approximation to the inflationary tensor spectrum .",
    "we will not reproduce it here , but a closely analogous derivation leads to the slow - roll expression for the primordial _",
    "scalar _ power spectrum : @xmath97 it is also useful to define the tensor / scalar ratio @xmath98 along with the scalar and tensor spectral indices    [ indices ] @xmath99    in the slow - roll formulae above , we have introduced the usual `` potential ''",

    "( [ def_tensor_power ] ) that the primordial tensor power spectrum  defined at some conformal time @xmath103 shortly after the end of inflation , when all modes of interest have already left the horizon , but have not yet re - entered  is related to the tensor power spectrum at a later time @xmath11 by a multiplicative transfer function @xmath104 where @xmath105 note that we will not necessarily want to evaluate @xmath106 at the present time ( @xmath107 ) , since different experiments probe the gravitational - wave spectrum at different redshifts .",
    "for example , while laser interferometers measure @xmath108 today , cmb experiments measure it near the redshift of recombination . as long as a mode remains outside the horizon ( @xmath109 ) ,",

    "note that , as @xmath7 varies between @xmath248 and @xmath249 , the damping factor @xmath125 varies between @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "in particular , if we substitute @xmath252 , corresponding to 3 standard neutrino species , the damping factor @xmath253 agrees with the results of numerical integrations @xcite .",
    "when the modes probed by the cmb re - enter the horizon , the temperature is relatively low ( corresponding to atomic - physics energies ) , so we are fairly confident that neutrinos are the only free - streaming relativistic particles .",
    "but when the modes probed by laser interferometers re - enter the horizon , the temperature is much higher ( above the electroweak phase transition , @xmath5  gev ) , so that the physics ( and , in particular , the instantaneous free - streaming fraction @xmath7 ) is much more uncertain .",
    "thus , laser interferometers offer the possibility of learning about the free - streaming fraction @xmath7 in the very early universe at temperatures between the inflationary and electroweak symmetry breaking scales .    finally ,",

    ", we consider various physical effects that cause the equation of state @xmath254 to deviate from @xmath255 during the radiation - dominated epoch , and the corresponding modifications that these effects induce in the gwb transfer function .",
    "some of these effects have been discussed previously by seto and yokoyama @xcite .",
    "the deviations @xmath256 primarily modify the transfer function through the redshift factor @xmath149 that appears in @xmath121 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ delta_zk_2nd_order ] ) and ( [ delta_zk_1st_order ] ) ] ; through the horizon - crossing factor @xmath257 [ see eq .",

    "( [ phi_k ] ) ] .",
    "we consider here six physical effects which can produce these kinds of modifications of the transfer function .",
    "first , deviations can be caused by mass thresholds in the early universe .",
    "suppose that all particle species are described by equilibrium distribution functions",

    "p&=&\\frac{1}{6\\pi^{2}}\\sum_{i}g_{i}^{}t_{i}^{4 }      \\int_{x_{i}^{}}^{\\infty}\\frac{(u^{2}-x_{i}^{2})^{3/2 } }      { { \\rm exp}[u - y_{i}^{}]\\pm1}du ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath151th species ( with mass @xmath260 , and @xmath261 internal degrees of freedom ) is described by temperature @xmath262 and chemical potential @xmath263 , and we have defined the dimensionless quantities @xmath264 and @xmath265 @xcite . in the denominator ,",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath266 signs are for fermions and bosons , respectively . then the deviation @xmath193 is given by the exact expression @xmath267 where @xmath268 represents the contribution from the @xmath151th species , @xmath269\\pm1}du\\ ] ] represents the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath270 is conventionally chosen to be the photon temperature , and we have defined the function @xmath271\\pm1}du.\\ ] ] for fixed @xmath272 , note that @xmath273 vanishes as @xmath274 goes to @xmath248 or @xmath275 ; and in between it has a fairly broad peak , with a maximum located at @xmath276 , and a peak value @xmath277 . in particular , when @xmath278 , then the ordered pair @xmath279 is @xmath280 for bosons and @xmath281 for fermions .",
    "this makes sense : we expect @xmath282 to vanish when @xmath283 ( since the species is relativistic ) and when @xmath284 ( since the species is non - relativistic , and makes a negligible contribution to the energy density ) . in between ,",
    "when @xmath285 , the @xmath151th species is cold enough to exhibit non - relativistic behavior , yet hot enough to contribute non - negligibly to the energy density .",
    "using the above equations , we can compute @xmath286 once we know @xmath287 and @xmath288 . but let us estimate the size of the effect .",
    "as a species becomes non - relativistic , it produces a maximum equation - of - state deviation @xmath289 in the background equation of state . furthermore , if @xmath290 different species ( with the same temperature and similar masses ) become non - relativistic at the same time , then ( roughly speaking ) the effect is multiplied by @xmath290 ( since their @xmath282 s add ) . ultimately , the fractional correction @xmath291 is model - dependent , but it can conceivably be as large as a few percent .",
    "second , deviations can be produced by a trace anomaly in the early universe . during the radiation - dominated epoch ,",
    "the universe is dominated by highly relativistic particles whose masses may be neglected .",
    "thus , each species is governed by a classical action that is conformally invariant at the classical level , leading to the usual conclusion that the stress - energy tensor is traceless and @xmath292 .",
    "but conformal invariance is broken at the quantum level by interactions among the particles , so that @xmath293 . for example , for a quark - gluon plasma governed by su(@xmath294 )",

    "third , deviations can be produced if the early universe behaves like a slightly imperfect fluid . the stress - energy tensor for an imperfect",
    "fluid contains ( in addition to the usual perfect - fluid terms ) three extra terms whose coefficients ( @xmath300 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 ) represent heat conduction , shear viscosity , and bulk viscosity ( see weinberg @xcite , ch .  2.11 ) . of these dissipative effects",
    ", only the bulk viscosity term @xmath303 can contribute to the background evolution in an frw universe ( see weinberg @xcite , chs .",
    "15.10 - 15.11 ) .",
    "this term modifies the continuity equation @xmath304\\ ] ] so that , as far as gravitational waves are concerned , the effective equation is corrected by @xmath305    whereas the three effects discussed thus far produce small corrections to the equation of state , it is worth mentioning three other effects that can produce much larger deviations .",
    "the first example is a massive particle species that decouples from the thermal plasma before its abundance becomes negligible .",
    "since its energy density falls as @xmath306 ( more slowly than the radiation density , which falls as @xmath307 ) , it can come to dominate the energy density of the universe before it decays ( if its lifetime @xmath308 is sufficiently long ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath6 drops to zero when the particle becomes dominant , and rises back to @xmath2 over a timescale given by the decay lifetime @xmath308 .",
    "second , extra - dimensional physics typically modifies the effective 4-dimensional friedmann equation .",
    "such modifications which , from the standpoint of the gwb , can in some cases look like corrections to the effective radiation equation of state , are primarily constrained by the requirement that the friedmann equation becomes sufficiently similar to the ordinary 4-dimensional friedmann equation ( with ordinary matter ) by the time of bbn .",
    "third , due to the weak coupling of the inflaton , the temperature at the start of the radiation dominated epoch ( the reheat temperature ) can be much lower than the energy scale at the end of inflation . in this case ,",
    "laser interferometer scales might actually re - enter the horizon during the reheating epoch ( before the start of radiation domination ) , when the equation of state was probably quite different from @xmath2 .",
    "the actual equation - of - state depends on the details of the reheating process , but a commonly - discussed value is @xmath309 , or some value in the range @xmath310 @xcite . if @xmath309 during reheating , the corresponding modification of the gwb might be similar to the modification due to the long - lived massive relic discussed above .",
    "note that the first of these six processes can be expressed as a modification of @xmath311 , and the effects on the transfer function can be computed using the methods discussed in ref .",
    "however , the other five can not .",
    ", for the inflationary model @xmath312 .",
    "the red dotted curve shows the damping effect due to ( three ordinary massless species of ) free - streaming neutrinos .",
    "the green dot - dashed curve shows the damping effect which arises if free - streaming particles make up fifty percent of the background energy density at the time @xmath313 when the modes probed by bbo / decigo re - enter the horizon . as shown in the figure",
    ", the particles begin free - streaming sometime before @xmath313 , and decay sometime after @xmath313 , but prior to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "finally , the blue dashed curve shows the effect of a conformal anomaly in the early universe that slightly reduces the equation of state from @xmath314 to @xmath315 above the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the spectrum will also be modified on comoving scales that re - enter the horizon during the reheating epoch after inflation ; but the range of scales affected by reheating is unknown . finally , note that the correlated bbo interferometer proposal claims a sensitivity that extends beyond the bottom of the figure ( down to roughly @xmath316 ) in the frequency range from @xmath317  hz to @xmath318  hz.,width=297 ]    fig .",
    "[ energy_plot ] illustrates some of the effects discussed in section [ transfer_fn ] . in this figure",
    ", the solid black curve represents the present - day energy spectrum , @xmath319 , generated by a particular inflationary model  namely , a quadratic potential @xmath312 . the red dotted curve illustrates the damping due to tensor anisotropic stress from free - streaming neutrinos",
    "we have assumed that the free - streaming fraction is @xmath252 , which is the @xmath7 value for three standard neutrino species which decouple around the time of bbn .",
    "the green dot - dashed curve represents the damping due to tensor anisotropic stress from various particle species ( @xmath320 particles ) which begin free - streaming before the scales detected by bbo / decigo re - enter the horizon and then decay after the scales re - enter , but prior to the electroweak phase transition . as an example",
    ", we have assumed that the free - streaming fraction is @xmath321 .",
    "finally , the blue dashed curve represents damping due to a trace anomaly that is present above the electroweak scale . for illustration",
    ", we have assumed that this anomaly , through eq .",
    "( [ trace_anom ] ) , reduces the equation of state from @xmath174 by @xmath322 .",
    "this reduction may be achieved by various combinations of the number of colors @xmath294 , the number of flavors @xmath295 , and the gauge coupling @xmath296 ; but the point is that we have not chosen an unreasonable large value for @xmath193 , given the large gauge groups that are often theorized to be present at high energies .    the key point conveyed by fig .",
    "[ energy_plot ] is that there are a variety of plausible post - inflationary effects that can produce rather large modifications of the gravitational - wave spectrum on laser - interferometer scales , without modifying the spectrum on cmb scales .",
    "this is tantalizing , since the modifications on laser - interferometer scales reflect the primordial dark age between the end of inflation and the electroweak phase transition , at energies beyond the reach of terrestrial particle accelerators .",
    "let us look ahead to future observations .",
    "first , as measurements of the scalar power spectrum improve , we will be restricted to considering inflationary models that match precisely the measured scalar perturbation spectrum on cmb scales .",
    "this is not enough to specify a unique model because there is a range of inflaton potentials whose scalar perturbation spectra are indistinguishable on cmb scales .",
    "for example , two such models are shown in fig .",
    "[ primordial ] .",
    "the two curves correspond to two different inflationary models whose parameters have been chosen so that they produce the same scalar amplitude and tilt on cmb scales , and match the observed scalar amplitude . from the figure ,",
    "though , we see that their primordial tensor power spectra are distinguishable .",
    "the upper solid curve corresponds to the simple quartic monomial potential @xmath324 , and the lower solid curve corresponds to the axion ( or `` natural inflation '' @xcite ) potential @xmath325 $ ] .",
    "note that the two spectra `` curve '' significantly downward over the broad range of wavenumbers shown in fig .",
    "[ primordial ] , so that they are not well described by a power - law ( straight - line ) approximation over this range . in particular , a power - law extrapolation based on cmb measurements will give a fairly poor estimate of the real spectrum on laser - interferometer scales .",
    "in fact , since the real spectra tend to redden increasingly on smaller scales ( _ i.e. _  as the end of inflation approaches ) , the cmb power - law extrapolation will tend to overestimate the tensor spectrum on laser - interferometer scales .",
    "second , note that the inflationary consistency relation ( [ consistency ] ) implies that a gravitational - wave spectrum with a larger tensor / scalar ratio @xmath60 on cmb scales also tends to have a `` redder '' ( more negative ) tilt @xmath326 .",
    "for gravitational waves with detectably - large amplitudes on cmb scales , this leads to the `` convergence effect '' in fig .",
    "[ primordial ] : if two different inflationary models produce scalar perturbations with the same amplitude and tilt on large ( cmb ) scales , then their tensor spectra tend to approach and even cross one another on small ( laser - interferometer ) scales , as illustrated by the two solid black curves in fig .",
    "[ primordial ] . as a result ,",
    "once one has measured the scalar and tensor perturbations on cmb scales , one expects the tensor spectrum on laser - interferometer scales to lie within a relatively narrow and predictable range .",
    "this is both good news and bad news for laser - interferometer science .",
    "the bad news is that the convergence effect tends to make laser interferometers less effective at breaking any remaining degeneracies between inflationary models because their predictions for the tensor spectrum are so similar on small scales .",
    "the degree to which laser interferometers can break such degeneracies has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the good news is that the measurements can potentially provide a model - independent test of a key inflationary prediction : that the tensor spectrum observed at long wavelengths really does extend to small wavelengths , as expected from the consistency relation ( [ consistency ] ) .",
    "furthermore , precise laser - interferometer measurements can serve as sensitive probes of new post - inflationary physics that modifies the transfer function on small scales .    in this light ,",
    "let us now imagine some time in the future in which we have successfully measured the tensor amplitude on cmb scales , and consider four possible outcomes of a laser - interferometer experiment ( like bbo ) .",
    "first , suppose that bbo detects the gravitational - wave amplitude at the expected value , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ primordial ] .",
    "this would be a quantitative confirmation of inflation generally , and of the inflationary consistency condition ( [ consistency ] ) in particular , since the large difference in wavenumber between cmb and laser - interferometer scales provides a large lever - arm to measure the tensor tilt @xmath327 .",
    "it would also suggest an upper bound on the size of any exotic effects in the transfer function on laser - interferometer scales .",
    "second , suppose that bbo detects the gravitational - wave amplitude significantly _ below _ its expected value .",
    "then the interpretation is less straighforward . on the one hand",
    ", we could interpret the suppression as being due to transfer - function effects , such as those discussed above . with this interpretation",
    ", the suppression would imply a rare opportunity to measure physical properties of the early universe , at temperatures above the electroweak scale , when the relevant modes re - entered the horizon . on the other hand",
    ", we could interpret the suppression to mean that inflation is more complicated than we expected : perhaps there is a feature in the inflaton potential which suppresses the primordial tensor spectrum on small scales relative to our expectations , or perhaps the consistency condition itself is violated ( as it is in some multi - field models of inflation ) .",
    "further measurements of the tensor spectrum at intermediate scales are needed to resolve this issue .",
    "third , suppose that bbo detects the gravitational - wave amplitude significantly _ above _ its expected value .",
    "at this point it is worth noting that virtually all of the transfer - function effects mentioned in section [ transfer_fn ] ( including tensor anisotropic stress , the late decay of a massive relic species , bulk viscosity , a conformal anomaly , or standard reheating with @xmath328 ) _ suppress _ the gravitational - wave spectrum on small scales , relative to large scales . in order to _ enhance _ the spectrum on laser - interferometer scales",
    ", one must invoke an even more exotic effect , such as a reheating epoch with a low reheat temperature and an unusual equation of state ( @xmath329 ) ; or the production of gravitational waves _ after _ inflation due to the collision of bubbles from a phase transition ; or perhaps extra - dimensional physics .",
    "fourth , suppose that bbo detects nothing at all .",
    "this would most likely indicate a fundamental problem with inflation , since an period of accelerating expansion produces a broad and nearly - flat spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations quite generically ( regardless of the particular model that drives inflation ) .",
    "one way out of this conclusion would be to invoke an extreme suppression effect in the transfer function on bbo scales  _",
    "e.g. _ due to a reheating epoch with equation of state @xmath309 and a reheat temperature well below @xmath330  gev . determining which interpretation is correct would require digging deeper , with more sensitive experiments on bbo scales .",
