    "after the publication of the papers by peccei and quinn @xcite , weinberg @xcite and wilczek @xcite , light pseudoscalar particles named axions have become the subject of active theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "this is because there is no other natural explanation for the absence of large _ cp _ violation and respective electric dipole moment of the neutron in strong interactions predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "in addition , axions reasonably explain the nature of dark matter in astrophysics @xcite which makes them of prime importance for our general physical concepts .",
    "a lot of experiments on searching axions have been performed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , but the detection was not succeeded yet . after the originally introduced qcd axions were constrained to a very narrow band of parameter space , many kinds of axion - like particles have been discussed in the framework of grand unified theory ( gut ) and string theory @xcite .",
    "specifically , much attention has been given to the models of gut ( dfsz ) axions @xcite and the so - called _ hadronic _ ( ksvz ) axions @xcite .",
    "the latter model involves a relationship between the axion - nucleon coupling constant and the breaking scale of the peccei - quinn symmetry and , in its turn , falls into several groups of models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "axion - like particles can interact with photons , electrons and nucleons .",
    "these interactions are used for experimental searches of axion - like particles in both the laboratory experiments ( see below ) and in astrophysics ( see , for instance , constraints on the axion - photon and axion - electron coupling constants obtained by means of axion solar telescope @xcite and from the compton process and electron - positron annihilation with an axion emission in stellar plasmas @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "both the laboratory and astrophysical constraints may depend on the model of axions used containing different relations between couplings to different particles ( for instance , the constraints from the solar axion data @xcite and from the neutrino data of supernova sn  1987a @xcite are found using the model of hadronic axions , where the coupling constant is a function of the axion mass ) .",
    "the astrophysical constraints may also depend on complicated behavior of matter in stars .",
    "for example , the coupling constants of hadronic axions to nucleons , obtained @xcite from an axion emission rate during stellar cooling , depend @xcite on significant uncertainties in the dense nuclear matter effects .",
    "furthermore , the astrophysical constraints could depend on the environment @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why the constraints following from the table - top laboratory experiments , which avoid such kind uncertainties and applicable to a wide range of axion - like particles , are of much interest for axion physics . at the same time it is necessary to stress that the astrophysical constraints are often much stronger than the laboratory limits .",
    "thus , from the solar axion data the upper limits for axion mass @xmath1ev @xcite and @xmath2ev @xcite were obtained . from the neutrino data of supernova sn 1987a and from stellar cooling by the emission of hadronic axions the coupling constant of axions to nucleons was found to be less or of order @xmath3 @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the model - independent constraints on an axion - neutron coupling constants were found with the help of a magnetometer using spin - polarized atoms .",
    "these constraints are the strongest for @xmath4 from @xmath3 to @xmath5ev . in ref .",
    "@xcite the constraints on an axion - nucleon coupling constants were obtained from the laboratory experiments of etvos @xcite and cavendish @xcite type for @xmath4 from @xmath6 to @xmath7ev . keeping in mind that the test bodies in these experiments were unpolarized",
    ", any additional force could come from the two - axion exchange between nucleons belonging to different test bodies . using the same approach , stronger constraints on the axion - nucleon coupling constants",
    "were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the results of more modern cavendish - type experiment @xcite in the region of axion masses from @xmath8 to @xmath9ev",
    ". the additional force arising due to two - axion exchange between nucleons was then used @xcite to constrain the axion - nucleon coupling constants from experiments on measuring the casimir - polder @xcite and casimir @xcite interactions .",
    "this allowed to strengthen the laboratory constraints on the coupling constants of axion - like particles to nucleons in the wide range of their masses from @xmath10ev to 15ev .    the previously obtained constraints on axion - like particles from the casimir effect @xcite used experiments with either plane or spherical boundary surfaces",
    "there is , however , another class of experiments on measuring the casimir force exploiting test bodies with corrugated surfaces . the normal casimir force between a smooth au - coated sphere and a rectangular corrugated si plate was measured and found in agreement with the scattering theory in refs .",
    "the use of si , whose density is smaller than of au , does not allow to get strongest constraints on axions using the data of these experiments .",
    "the normal casimir force between sinusoidally corrugated au - coated surfaces of a sphere and a plate was measured in ref .",
    "@xcite and also found in agreement with computations using the scattering theory .",
    "this experiment is rather promising for constraining the coupling constants of axion - like particles to nucleons . in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite the lateral casimir force acting in tangential direction to the sinusoidally corrugated au - coated surfaces of a sphere and a plate has been measured .",
    "the comparison with computational results using the scattering theory demonstrated a very good agreement with the measurement data @xcite .",
    "thus , these experiments are also of high promise for obtaining new constraints on the interaction of axion - like particles with nucleons .    in this paper ,",
    "we obtain the constraints on the coupling constants of axion - like particles to nucleons using the measure of agreement with theory of the experimental data of refs .  @xcite exploiting the corrugated au - coated surfaces of a sphere and a plate . for this purpose",
    ", we calculate the additional normal and lateral forces arising between the sinusoidally corrugated surfaces of a sphere and a plate due to two - axion exchange .",
    "the constraints are found from the fact that these forces were not observed in the limits of experimental error .",
    "they are shown to be the strongest laboratory constraints in the region of masses of axion - like particles from 8 to 20ev .",
    "this conclusion is obtained from the comparison with other laboratory constraints on the coupling constants of axion - like particles to nucleons obtained in the literature for @xmath4 larger than @xmath0ev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we calculate the additional normal force due to two - axion exchange between the sinusoidally corrugated bodies and derive the constraints on the coupling constants of axion - like particles to nucleons from the experimental data of ref .",

    "in ref .  @xcite the normal casimir force was measured between a sinusoidally corrugated au - coated plate and a sinusoidally corrugated au - coated sphere at various angles between the uniaxial corrugations from @xmath12 to @xmath13 using an atomic force microscope ( afm ) . in what follows ,",
    "we use the measurement data for parallel corrugation axes .",
    "the plate was the diffraction grating with uniaxial sinusoidal corrugations of period @xmath14 nm and amplitude @xmath15 nm .",
    "the side of the plate was equal to 1 cm allowing to consider it infinitely large .",
    "the grating was made of a hard epoxy with density @xmath16 and coated with an au layer of thickness @xmath17 nm . the corrugations on the bottom surface of a polystyrene sphere of density @xmath18 were imprinted under pressure from the plate . for technological purposes",
    "the sphere was coated with a layer of cr of thickness @xmath19 nm , then with a layer of al of thickness @xmath20 nm , and finally with a layer of au of thickness @xmath21 nm .",
    "the outer radius of the coated sphere was measured to be @xmath22 m .",
    "the imprinted corrugations on the sphere have had the same period as on the plate and the amplitude @xmath23 nm .",
    "the size of the imprint area was @xmath24 m , i.e. , much larger than the corrugation period @xmath25 .",
    "now , let us calculate the normal ( i.e. , perpendicular to the mean levels of boundary surfaces ) force acting between a sinusoidally corrugated spherical envelope of thickness @xmath26 and a sinusoidally corrugated plate of thickness @xmath27 due to exchange of two axion - like particles between protons and neutrons belonging to them .",
    "we assume the pseudoscalar character of an axion - fermion coupling and neglect the axion - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "the account of the latter and possible scalar axion - fermion coupling @xcite could lead to only a minor strengthening of the obtained constraints .",
    "the pseudoscalar interaction of axions @xmath28 with fermions @xmath29 is described by the lagrangian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the coupling constant for an axion to a proton ( @xmath32 ) or to a neutron ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "note that the originally introduced qcd axions are pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons and their interaction with fermions is described by the pseudovector interaction lagrangian @xmath34 both the pseudoscalar and pseudovector lagrangians ( [ 0a ] ) and ( [ 0b ] ) result in one and the same action after the integration by parts is performed .",
    "however , the quantum field theory with the pseudoscalar lagrangian ( [ 0a ] ) is renormalizable , whereas it is nonrenormalizable with the pseudovector lagrangian ( [ 0b ] ) .",
    "this may result in some nonequivalence @xcite .",
    "below we assume the pseudoscalar interaction ( [ 0a ] ) which is applicable to a wide class of axion models , specifically , to all gut axion - like particles @xcite .    first , we consider two plane parallel plates of infinitely large area with thicknesses @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "let the coordinate plane @xmath35 coincide with an upper surface of the lower plate , and the @xmath36 axis be perpendicular to it .",
    "let @xmath36 be the varying separation distance between the plates . using the pseudoscalar lagrangian ( [ 0a ] ) , the effective interaction potential due to exchange of two axion - like particles between two nucleons situated at the points @xmath37 of the lower plate and @xmath38 of the upper plate has the form @xcite @xmath39 here , @xmath40 for protons and @xmath41 for neutrons",

    "the casimir force between a corrugated sphere and a corrugated plate was measured at separations @xmath90 nm and found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions of the scattering theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is a generalization of the lifshitz theory of the van der waals and casimir forces for the case of boundary surfaces of arbitrary shape @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there is a problem in theory - experiment comparison connected with different models for the low - frequency behavior of the dielectric permittivity @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the measurement data of the most precise experiments using a metal - coated sphere above a metal - coated plate agree with theoretical predictions only if the relaxation of conduction electrons is omitted ( in so doing the relaxation properties of bound electrons are taken into account ) . at separation distances of a few hundred nanometers",
    "the effect of relaxation of free electrons comes to only several percent .",
    "however , the theoretical predictions taking this kind of ralaxation into account were reliably excluded in the dynamic experiments performed by means of afm @xcite and micromachined oscillator @xcite .    luckily , this problem is unrelated to experiments with corrugated surfaces under consideration here .",
    "the point is that they are performed by means of afm at shorter separation distances where the dymanic mode is inoperable . as a result ,",

    "this error was determined at the 67% confidence level as a combination of random and systematic errors .",
