    "the physical conditions in the inner parts of the accretion flow surrounding a black hole are likely to be very chaotic .",
    "a situation that has been often considered in the literature is that of the so - called cauldron , where a soup formed by a hot plasma contains small grains constituted by small dense clouds of much colder matter ( e.g. guilbert & rees 1988 ) .",
    "several works were devoted to explain how such a configuration could be physically realized and compute the spectrum emitted by the clouds for different cloud optical depths ( see e.g. rees 1987 ; ferland & rees 1988 ; rees , netzer & ferland 1989 ; celotti , fabian & rees 1992 ; kuncic , blackman & rees 1996 ; collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1996 ; kuncic , celotti & rees 1997 ; krolik 1998 ) .",
    "in particular the main observable effect of optically thick cold clouds is the reprocessing into soft uv photons of the hard x - ray radiation produced in the hot phase by the comptonisation process .",
    "this reprocessed emission is likely to contribute , at least partly , to the big blue bump observed in agn .",
    "in addition , the presence of such clumps inside the hot plasma may also contribute to the formation of a reflection component ( see e.g. nandra & george 1994 ) , responsible for the bump in the hard x - ray domain , commonly observed in seyfert galaxies and galactic black hole candidates .",
    "most of the previous works on cloud models focused on the physics and radiative processes in the clouds themselves , without taking into account the possible effects of the clouds on the characteristics of the hot phase . indeed the soft radiation",
    "re  emitted by the cold material can constitute the main radiation field responsible for the compton cooling of the hot gas .",
    "this in turn affects the temperature of the hot plasma , and thus the emitted x - ray comptonised spectrum .",
    "this feedback loop is identical to that found in accretion disc corona models ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ) .",
    "similarly , the conditions at radiative equilibrium depend mainly on the cold matter distribution relative to the hot plasma . in this context , malzac ( 2001 ) ( hereafter m01 ) studied a geometry where the clouds are external to the hot comptonising plasma and spherically distributed around it .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the effects of the presence of cold optically thick clouds distributed _ inside _ the hot phase . as demonstrated below",
    ", the cooling by the cold clouds is then more efficient than in the case of an external reprocessor .    under assumptions detailed in section  [ sec : assump ] , we use a numerical approach based on non - linear monte - carlo simulations , described in section  [ sec : numap ] , to compute the emitted spectra .",
    "these numerical results are found to be in agreement with analytical formulae , derived in section  [ sec : analrg ] , giving the slope of the primary x - ray comptonised spectrum @xmath0 and the reflection amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "the predictions of the model are then discussed and compared with the data in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "+    the physical characteristics of the clouds are of prime importance for the emitted spectrum .",
    "if they are optically ( thomson ) thin , and with a large covering fraction , partial transmission of the x - ray radiation across a cloud is likely to produce strong absorption features in the x - ray spectrum ( e.g. kuncic , celotti & rees 1997 ) . on the other hand , if the clouds are optically thick and highly absorbing they do not produce , independent of their covering fraction , strong apparent absorption features , as indeed observed ( nandra & george 1994 ) .",
    "for this reason in this analysis we will consider the case of optically thick clouds with zero transmission , which corresponds to typical column densities @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the individual cold clouds are much smaller than the characteristic size of the region occupied by the hot plasma : if the emitting region has a typical dimension @xmath4 , the typical cloud size is of order @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "this constrains the cloud hydrogen density to be large , larger than @xmath7 .",
    "this limit writes @xmath8 @xmath9 in the case of seyfert galaxies ( agn , with @xmath10 @xmath11 cm ) , and @xmath12 @xmath9 in the case of galactic black holes ( gbh , where @xmath13 @xmath14 cm ) .",
    "such large densities in turn constrain the ionization parameter to be relatively low ( @xmath15@xmath1610@xmath17 for a @xmath18 erg s@xmath19 luminosity agn , and @xmath15@xmath1610@xmath20 for a @xmath21 erg s@xmath19 gbh ) and thus the possible effects of ionization are likely to be weak ( ycki et al .",
    "in our calculations we will then assume that the clouds are neutral .",
    "we will consider a system in radiative equilibrium .",
    "the effective temperature of the clouds @xmath22 can be simply estimated .",
    "assuming that the flux is uniform inside a spherical hot phase of bolometric luminosity @xmath23 , a cloud surface element will receive a flux @xmath24 . if the clouds are dense enough this flux is fully absorbed and re  radiated as a quasi - blackbody ( e.g. ferland & rees 1988 ) and the stefan ",
    "boltzmann s law gives well known characteristic energies : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the bolometric luminosity expressed respectively in @xmath18 and @xmath21 erg s@xmath19 units .",
    "we will assume that the radiation reprocessed by the clouds is the only source of soft seed photons .",
    "as we are focusing on the spectral signatures of this two phase medium and as they do not constrain  as already mentioned  the physical status of the clouds ( as long as they are optically thick and dense enough to maintain a low temperature ) , the clumps might exist with a large range of conditions .",
    "nonetheless the range of parameters considered ( in dimension and density ) are consistent with assuming that the gas reaches radiative equilibrium ( i.e. the cooling timescales are shorter than the dynamical one ) and pressure equilibrium ( with a size @xmath5 small enough to reach it in a dynamical timescale ) .    in general if neutral clouds are confined by a hot ionized environment the thermal pressure balance can be written in terms of the cloud thomson optical depth @xmath28 : @xmath29    for typical observationally inferred values of @xmath30 and @xmath31=100 kev , and using the expressions  ( [ eq : temp ] ) for the temperature of the cold clouds , equation  ( [ eq : preseq ] ) reads : @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "we note however that this simple estimate does not consider the possibility of a two temperature plasma and the consequent effects of hot ions on the thermal balance ( see zdziarski 1998 ; spruit & haardt 2000 ; deufel & spruit 2000 ) .",
    "thus the thick clouds considered here can be confined by the hot phase , but in any case thicker clouds may exist and be e.g. magnetically confined ( for more details see e.g. kuncic , blackman & rees 1996 ) . note that the clumps do not need to survive for longer that their cooling time provided they can be continuously replaced .",
    "let us now consider the spectrum produced in these environment .",
    "the three main parameters controlling the resulting x-/@xmath34-ray spectral shape are the following :    1 .   the amount of cold clouds pervading the hot plasma .",
    "since we consider small scale clumps we can quantify the amount of cold matter by using an effective `` cloud '' optical depth @xmath35 , such that a photon crossing the hot plasma has a probability @xmath36 of intercepting a cloud .",
    "@xmath35 may be thus defined using a cross section formalism , considering an individual cloud as a particle : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the plasma volume , @xmath39 is the total number of cold clouds , @xmath40 is the average geometric cross section of each cloud . for spherical clouds pervading a spherical plasma , @xmath35",
    "can be written explicitly in term of the number and size of the clouds : @xmath41 2 .   the thomson optical depth @xmath42 of the hot plasma .",
    "3 .   the characteristic energy of the soft photons emitted by the clouds .",
    "we assume a blackbody spectrum with a fixed temperature @xmath22 . as the radiative equilibrium is not extremely sensitive to the value of @xmath22",
    ", we will fix @xmath22=5 ev and @xmath22=150 ev as typical values for seyfert galaxies and gbh sources , respectively , as from equation  ( [ eq : temp ] ) .",
    "as said before , the amount of cold matter and its distribution with respect to the hot plasma are of prime importance . on the other hand ,",
    "the actual geometry of the emitting region has little effects on the emitted spectrum .",
    "we studied both the spherical and infinite slab geometries illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] . as the results were qualitatively similar for both geometries , in",
    "the following we consider the spherical case only .",
    "in order to estimate the resulting physical parameters and spectra we use the monte - carlo code of malzac & jourdain ( 2000 ) which is based on the non - linear monte - carlo method ( nlmc ) proposed by stern ( stern 1985 ; stern et al .",
    "we consider a spherical geometry .",
    "the sphere is divided in 5 shells with equal thicknesses and is assumed to have a uniform density .",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath42 are defined along the radius @xmath4 of the sphere .    in the hot phase ,",
    "the simulations are fully non - linear : both photons and electrons are followed using the large particles ( lp ) formalism described in stern et al .",
    "this enables the equilibrium temperature to be computed in each zone according to the local energy balance heating = compton cooling .",
    "the interaction between a photon and a cloud is dealt as a regular monte - carlo interaction between two particles . however , as the cold clouds structure is assumed to be unaffected by the radiation field , the clouds themselves are not followed . as the clouds are small and homogeneously distributed , @xmath35 is simply the reaction rate for 1 photon , with time expressed in units of the light crossing time @xmath43 of the medium .",
    "when a lp photon interacts with a cloud , it is assumed to enter a semi - infinite slab medium with standard abundances and neutral matter ( morrison & mc  cammon 1983 ) .",
    "the linear monte - carlo code of malzac et al .  (",
    "1998 ) , is then used to track the path and the energy changes of the lp photon in this medium , until it is either absorbed or escapes from the cold matter slab . as long as the clouds are optically thick , the reflection spectrum on a cloud does not differ much from slab reflection ( nandra & george 1994 ) . a more detailed modeling of the reflection component would rely on a specific cloud geometry which is essentially unknown .",
    "the energy deposited in the cloud is re - injected in the hot phase in the form of thermal soft photons lp . both the reflected and reprocessed lp",
    "have a direction of propagation drawn from an isotropic distribution .",
    "there are two parameters generally used to phenomenologically describe the x - ray spectral properties of accreting black hole sources , namely the amplitude @xmath1 of the reflection component with respect to the primary continuum and the photon spectral index @xmath0 of the power - law shaped primary component ( see malzac , beloborodov & poutanen 2001 , mbp hereafter ) .",
    "these parameters were determined from the numerical simulations in a way similar to that described in mbp .",
    "the reflection was estimated by computing the flux ratio between our simulated reflection , and the angle - averaged slab - reflection produced by a source having the same primary spectrum as the simulated one .    however , using the simple escape probability formalism described in the following , it is also possible to independently derive analytical estimates for @xmath1 and @xmath0 , as follows .",
    "a power @xmath44 is deposited in the plasma as heating and escapes the system as three different kinds of radiation : @xmath45 respectively the uv / soft x - ray reprocessed luminosity , the x - ray ( comptonized ) luminosity , and the reflected luminosity .",
    "let @xmath46 be the total radiative energy inside the hot plasma .",
    "with similar notations as in equation  ( [ eq : lumbal ] ) we have : @xmath47    the escaping luminosity is related to the internal energy through the escape probability ( lightman & zdziarski 1987 ) : @xmath48 which depends on the geometry , sources distribution , optical depth and energy .",
    "we consistently indicate as @xmath49 , @xmath50,@xmath51 the escape probability for comptonised , soft and reflected radiation and will use the analytical approximation to @xmath52 given in the appendix ( equation  ( [ eq : peschomsph ] ) ) .",
    "let us now estimate the three different luminosities .",
    "the soft luminosity in the hot phase is produced by the clouds through absorption and reprocessing of the comptonized and reflected radiation and disappears through escape or comptonisation .",
    "thus , the radiative equilibrium balance for @xmath53 reads : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the clouds energy and angle integrated albedo for a comptonised and a reflection spectrum , respectively . for neutral matter",
    "the typical values are @xmath57 ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ; mbp ) and @xmath58 ( malzac 2001 ) .",
    "similarly , the reflected radiation is formed through reflection of the comptonised and reflected radiation on the clouds , and disappears via escape , comptonisation in the hot plasma and absorption by the clouds : @xmath59    the fraction of the internal energy in the form of comptonised radiation has as main source the power dissipated in the hot plasma but also the comptonised soft and reflected radiation ; the sink term is due to escape , absorption and reflection by the clouds : @xmath60    excluding the reflection component , the total luminosity sinking out of the hot phase either through escape or interaction with the clouds is : @xmath61 while the soft luminosity entering the hot phase ( coming from the clouds ) is given by equation  ( [ eq : usbal ] ) : @xmath62    therefore combining equations ( [ eq : l ] ) and ( [ eq : ls ] ) with equations ( [ eq : usbal ] ) and ( [ eq : urbal ] ) provides an estimate for the amplification factor @xmath63 : @xmath64 where the factor @xmath65 is given by : @xmath66 note that at first order @xmath67 and @xmath68 and thus : @xmath69    finally the amplification factor is clearly directly related to the photon index @xmath0 , which can therefore be expressed  using the phenomenological formula given by beloborodov ( 1999 )  as @xmath70 where the parameter @xmath71 for agn and @xmath72 for gbhs .    in addition equation  ( [ eq : urbal ] ) provides an estimate for the second parameter , the reflection coefficient : @xmath73 this formula corresponds to an angle averaged reference slab - reflection spectrum . actually , the reflection coefficient also depends on the assumed inclination angle for the infinite slab model ( see e.g. pexrav model in xspec , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : r ] ) could be corrected for this , for example by dividing it by the angular factor given by equation 2 of ghisellini , haardt & matt ( 1994 ) . however , for the relatively low inclination angles usually assumed in spectral fits , the correction is small and , for simplicity , we will neglect it .",
    "figure  [ fig : exspectra ] shows some of the simulated spectra for different values of @xmath35 .",
    "the radiative cooling from the clouds appears to be extremely efficient and starts being effective for values of @xmath35 as low as a few @xmath74 . at fixed @xmath42 and @xmath75 ,",
    "increasing @xmath35 increases the cooling of the plasma ( because of the enhancement of the reprocessing and the subsequent increase of the soft radiation field ) and therefore decreases its temperature ( see below ) .",
    "this affects the shape of the emitted spectrum which becomes softer and cuts off at lower energies .",
    "note that for the same set of parameters the spectra of gbhs ( right panel of the figure ) are harder than the agns ones ( left panel ) due to the larger energy domain where the luminosity can be released in the latter objects ( see e.g. mbp ) .",
    "the spectra shown are rather similar to what is observed in seyfert galaxies and galactic black hole candidates in their hard state ( see e.g. zdziarski et al .",
    "1997 , poutanen 1998 ) .",
    "the dependence of the hot plasma temperature on @xmath35 is illustrated more precisely by fig .",
    "[ fig : tedetaub ] . as just said the temperature is generally lower in agns ( for the same @xmath35 ) and it is higher for lower thomson optically depths .",
    "while these are general features ( see e.g. mbp ) of the self - regulated compton emission generally invoked by the two - phase models ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ) , note that in our case the product @xmath76 is @xmath77 expected to be constant at fixed @xmath35 since here the compton parameter depends also slightly on @xmath42 ( see section  [ sec : analrg ] ) .",
    "the observed range of temperatures  say 50 - 200 kev  inferred from observations of the high energy cut off in seyfert galaxies and gbhs can be reproduced for @xmath35 in the range @xmath78@xmath79 , depending also widely on @xmath42 . in the optically thick case",
    "larger values of @xmath35 may induce very low temperatures .",
    "a second observable parameter is the index of the ( primary ) x - ray spectrum .",
    "[ fig : rgdetaub ] shows the evolution of the 210 kev spectral slope for increasing @xmath35 : as expected the spectrum softens very quickly for larger @xmath35 .",
    "one can see that the range of spectral slopes observed in seyfert galaxies and gbh in the hard state ( approximately the range 1.42.2 ) can be achieved for @xmath35 roughly in the interval 10@xmath80@xmath79 ( larger @xmath35 clearly lead to a too soft spectrum ) . note that although such interval is rather large , the dependence on @xmath35 is quite steep especially in the gbh case .",
    "finally let us examine the results on the intensity of the reflection component , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgdetaub ] ( left - hand panel ) .",
    "this immediately reveals that the inferred values of @xmath1 are rather low , even when @xmath35 approaches unity , and in general significantly lower than observed . according to equation  ( [ eq : r ] ) , @xmath1 values of order of unity",
    "can be achieved in the limit of large @xmath35 . however",
    ", this corresponds to very large ( and unobserved ) @xmath0 , as discussed in the next section .    as shown in the same fig .",
    "[ fig : rgdetaub ] , we also stress here that there is good agreement between the numerical results and the analytical estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath0 derived in section [ sec : analrg ] . concerning @xmath0,we note however a significant discrepancy for the gbh optically thin case , for which the simulations give a much harder spectrum than the analytical estimates .",
    "indeed , in this case the first compton scattering order falls in the 210 kev range .",
    "this forms a bump making the spectrum locally harder in the energy range used to estimate @xmath0 , and with a break at higher energy .",
    "this ( unobserved ) radiative transfer effect is due to the low optical depth ( @xmath42=0.5 ) considered .",
    "a part from this the main discrepancies appear in the optically thick case and at large @xmath35 ( corresponding to @xmath0 outside the observed range ) arising because in this interval of parameters associated with low temperatures , equation  ( [ eq : belo ] ) , which is formally valid for a spherical plasma with temperature in the range 50100 kev , does not provide a good approximation to the @xmath0 vs @xmath81 relation anymore .",
    "+    from the computation of the spectra expected in a scenario where cold reflecting and reprocessing gas is embedded in a coronal hot plasma we have inferred constraints on the distribution of such cold gas . in fact , having assumed that the gas can be described as small optically thick clouds , the main parameter regulating the amount of reprocessing ( in turn responsible for the compton cooling ) and reflection is the cloud optical depth @xmath35 , which quantifies the covering factor of the cold component .",
    "this has to be relatively low .",
    "in fact , the observed range of spectral slopes constrains @xmath82 .",
    "this limit however forbids to produce simultaneously a reflection amplitude larger than @xmath83 .",
    "the situation is even more critical since @xmath84 is predicted only for the softest sources which observationally appear to show the largest reflection amplitude ( @xmath85 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgcor ] .",
    "thus , in order to reproduce the spectral characteristics of numerous objects ( both seyfert galaxies and gbh sources ) with significant reflection the model requires an additional reflecting medium which does not contribute to the soft photon field , such as e.g. a cold outer accretion disc , reflection on a torus in the case of seyfert galaxies or on the companion star in the case of x - ray binaries .    the reported correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgcor ] ) is generally interpreted as being due to plasma cooling on soft photons emitted by the same medium that gives rise to the reflection component ( see zdziarski et al . 1999 ; gilfanov et al .",
    "if the @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation were indicative of a common medium for soft photon creation and reflection , such a medium can not be provided by cold matter mixed together with the hot phase , and another reflector should contribute to , and even dominate the radiative cooling of the hot plasma .",
    "a related problem is the observed correlation between the degree of relativistic broadening of the fe line with @xmath0 ( gilfanov et al .",
    "2000 for black hole binaries , lubiski & zdziarski 2001 for seyferts , see however yaqoob et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the context of the present model",
    "this correlation would suggest that the overall cloud distribution is not homogeneous .",
    "the changes in the amount of cold material pervading the hot plasma should be stronger in the innermost parts of the accretion flow where the relativistic broadening is important .",
    "however , since the reflection amplitude produced by the cold clump is weaker than observed , this requires that the bulk of the line would be emitted by the cold clouds while the reflection would come mainly from an external reflector .",
    "thus , the origin of both soft photons and reflection are unlikely to be matter mixed inside the hot comptonising plasma . in the framework of the cloud models",
    "this suggests that the cold clouds should be essentially external to the hot comptonising plasma .",
    "then the radiative cooling is much less efficient and the reflection component may be larger .",
    "variations in the covering factor and the distribution of the clouds may even produce a correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( as e.g. in the spherical case considered by m01 )",
    ".    these conclusions should be however tempered by the fact that , in seyfert galaxies , the @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation is still a controversial matter on several grounds .",
    "indeed , the measurment of the reflection amplitude @xmath1 suffers from large uncertainties .",
    "in particular , it appears that the @xmath1 values derived from spectral fits are very sensitive to the modelling of the primary spectrum ( see e.g. petrucci et al .",
    "2001 ; perola et al .",
    "2002 ; malzac & petrucci 2002 ) as well as to the eventual presence of a secondary components such as a soft excess ( matt 2001 ) .",
    "possible effects such as ionization of the reflecting material , eventual relativistic smearing , comptonisation of the reflected component may all affect the @xmath1 values derived from the neutral slab reflection model generally used ( pexrav ) .",
    "we also note that in ngc 5506 , lamer , uttley & mchardy ( 2000 ) find an anti - correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "also , even if the correlation is real , its interpretation could be different . indeed , following nandra et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , malzac & petrucci ( 2001 , 2002 ) show that at least part of the observed correlation could be understood in term of the effects of time - delays between the fluctuations of the primary emission and the response of a large - scale distant reflector ( e.g a torus ) . obviously ,",
    "because of the time - scales involved , this interpretation can not be valid for black - hole binaries .",
    "on the other hand , in seyfert galaxies , it is supported by spectral and variability studies indicating that , in several sources , an important fraction of the reflected features is produced at large distances from the central engine ( e.g. chiang et al . 2000 for ngc 5548 ; matt et al .",
    "2001 and lamer et al .",
    "2000 , for ngc 5506 ; done , madejski & ycki 2000 for ic4329a , papadakis et al .",
    "2002 , for a sample of sources ) . in a context",
    "where the reflection features would be produced mainly on distant material , the `` cauldron '' scenario considered here would remain a viable possibility .",
    "future observational studies of the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation in samples of sources as well as in individual objects should clarify this point .",

    "let us consider a medium where both scattering and absorption of radiation are effective , with @xmath86 the total optical depth of the medium for the scattering process and @xmath87 for absorption .",
    "assume one injects instantaneously in the volume a number of photons according to a given spatial distribution .",
    "the photons can disappear from the medium either by real escape ( i.e. by crossing the volume boundaries ) or by absorption .",
    "let @xmath88 be the distribution of the photons at their disappearance time , and @xmath89 the fraction of photons that truly escape the medium ( i.e. not absorbed ) .",
    "then , from the definition of the escape probability given by equation  ( [ eq : pesc ] ) , it is straightforward to show that : @xmath90    using a standard monte - carlo method , we estimated @xmath89 and the @xmath88 function for different geometries and source distributions . in these calculations",
    "the scattering process was assumed isotropic and the distribution of scatterers and absorbers was homogeneous .",
    "we then computed numerically @xmath91 and searched for analytical formulae giving a reasonable representation of the numerical results in the range @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the expressions given below agree within 5@xmath94 with our numerical results . for slab and sphere geometries , the optical depths @xmath87 and @xmath86 are defined along the full height of the slab and the radius of the sphere , respectively .",
    "these expressions are general and can be applied to any situation where both absorption and scattering are important .",
    "for the situation considered in this work , the scattering @xmath86 and absorption @xmath87 optical depths depend on the type of radiation considered ( see section  [ sec : analrg ] ) :    * for the comptonised component : @xmath86=@xmath42 and @xmath87=@xmath35 * for the reflected component : @xmath86=@xmath99 , @xmath87=@xmath42+@xmath1001-@xmath56)@xmath35 * for the soft component : @xmath86=@xmath35 , @xmath87=@xmath42"
