    "the development of structure in the universe was well advanced at high redshifts .",
    "quasars have been detected nearly to @xmath2 , and the most distant galaxies to even greater distances ( weymann 1998 ) .",
    "the forest in the spectra of high redshift qsos shows that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) itself developed extensive nonlinear structures by early times . still unknown , however , is the epoch during which the first generation of stars was formed , and the time scale over which the transition from a neutral universe to one that is almost completely reionized took place .",
    "while numerical simulations have shown that the igm is expected to fragment into structures at early times in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogonies ( cen 1994 ; zhang 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ; zhang 1998 ) , the same simulations are much less able to predict the efficiency with which the first gravitationally collapsed objects lit up the universe at the end of the `` dark age '' ( rees 1998 ) .",
    "the nature of the first dominant ionizing sources is still unknown , and although ir observations will permit even higher redshift galaxies to be observed , detections become increasingly difficult because of the surface brightness dimming from cosmological expansion .",
    "madau , meiksin , & rees ( 1997 , hereafter mmr ) demonstrated that radiation sources prior to the epoch of reionization may be detected indirectly through their impact on the surrounding neutral igm and the resulting emission or absorption against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at the frequency corresponding to the redshifted 21cm line .",
    "while its energy density is estimated to be about two orders of magnitude lower than the cmb , the 21cm spectral signature will display angular structure as well as structure in redshift space due to inhomogeneities in the gas density field ( hogan & rees 1979 ; scott & rees 1990 ) , hydrogen ionized fraction , and spin temperature ( mmr ) .",
    "because of the smoothness of the cmb sky , fluctuations in the 21cm radiation will dominate the cmb fluctuations by about 2 orders of magnitude on several arcmin scales .",
    "radio observations at meter wavelengths have therefore the potential to tell us how ( as well as when ) the primordial gas was reheated and reionized : if the reheating was due to ultraluminous but sparsely distributed sources like qsos , or by fainter but more uniformly distributed objects like an abundant population of pregalactic stars .    in this paper",
    "we discuss possible ways in which the next generation of radio telescopes could provide the first observations of a neutral igm at a level of a few tenths of @xmath3jy arcmin@xmath4 . the proposed _ square kilometer array _",
    "( _ ska _ ) would provide an enhancement of about two orders of magnitude in sensitivity relative to present ",
    "day radio telescopes ( taylor & braun 1999 ) .",
    "we discuss the technical requirements necessary to detect the 21cm signature from the igm and describe a possible design for a special purpose telescope .",
    "we emphasize that within existing technological limits , radio astronomy could effectively open up much of the universe to a direct study of the reheating and reionization epochs .",
    "the ground state hyperfine levels of hydrogen will very quickly reach thermal equilibrium with the cmb . in order to detect the igm in either emission or absorption ,",
    "it is crucial that an effective mechanism be present to decouple the hydrogen spin states from the cmb .",
    "following mmr , we briefly review below the mechanisms that determine the level populations of the hyperfine state of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( see also meiksin 1999 ) .",
    "the emission or absorption of 21cm radiation from a neutral igm is governed by the hydrogen spin temperature @xmath5 , defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the singlet and triplet @xmath9 hyperfine levels , @xmath10k , @xmath11 is the frequency of the 21cm transition , @xmath12 is planck s constant , and @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant . in the presence of only the cmb radiation with @xmath14k",
    ", the spin states will reach thermal equilibrium with the cmb on a timescale of @xmath15yr ( @xmath16s@xmath17 is the spontaneous decay rate of the hyperfine transition of atomic hydrogen ) , and intergalactic will produce neither an absorption nor an emission signature .",
    "a mechanism is required that decouples @xmath5 and @xmath18 , e.g. by coupling the spin temperature instead to the kinetic temperature @xmath19 of the gas itself .",
    "two mechanisms are available , collisions between hydrogen atoms ( purcell & field 1956 ) and scattering by photons ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1958 ) .",
    "the collision  induced coupling between the spin and kinetic temperatures is dominated by the spin ",
    "exchange process between the colliding hydrogen atoms .",
    "the rate , however , is too small for realistic igm densities at the redshifts of interest , although collisions may be important in dense regions , @xmath20^{-2}$ ] ( mmr ) .    in the low density igm ,",
    "the dominant mechanism is the scattering of continuum uv photons redshifted by the hubble expansion into local photons .",
    "the many scatterings mix the hyperfine levels of neutral hydrogen in its ground state via intermediate transitions to the @xmath21 state , the wouthuysen  field process .",
    "an atom initially in the @xmath9 singlet state absorbs a photon that puts it in an @xmath22 state , allowing it to return to the triplet @xmath9 state by a spontaneous decay .",
    "as the neutral igm is highly opaque to resonant scattering , the shape of the continuum radiation spectrum near will follow a boltzmann distribution with a temperature given by the kinetic temperature of the igm ( field 1959 ) . in this case",
    "the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen is a weighted mean between the matter and cmb temperatures , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tspin ] ) .",
    "the radio emission may make an important contribution in the vicinity of a radio  loud quasar ( bahcall & ekers 1969 ) , and would itself permit the igm to be detected in 21cm radiation .",
    "this may be an important process if the emission of ionizing radiation is more tightly beamed than the radio continuum emission , allowing the gas to remain neutral near the quasar after it has switched on ( mmr ) . ]",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pumping efficiency . here",
    "@xmath25 is the indirect de  excitation rate of the triplet @xmath9 state via absorption of a photon to the @xmath22 level , and @xmath26 is assumed . if @xmath27 is large , @xmath28 , signifying equilibrium with the matter .",
    "a consideration of the net transition rates between the various hyperfine @xmath9 and @xmath22 levels above shows that the @xmath29 transition rate via scattering is related to the total rate @xmath30 by @xmath31 ( field 1958 ) .",
    "this relation and equation  ( [ eq : tspin ] ) are derived in the appendix . in the limit @xmath32 ,",
    "the fractional deviation in a steady state of the spin temperature from the temperature of the cmb is @xmath33 there exists then a critical value of @xmath30 which , if greatly exceeded , would drive @xmath34 .",
    "this `` thermalization '' rate is ( mmr ) @xmath35      consider a patch of neutral hydrogen with an angular diameter on the sky larger than the beamwidth of the telescope , and a radial velocity width broader than the bandwidth . in an einstein  de sitter universe with @xmath36 and baryon density parameter @xmath37 , the optical depth of the patch at @xmath38 cm for a spin temperature @xmath39 is @xmath40 the optical depth will typically be much less than unity .",
    "since the brightness temperature through the igm is @xmath41 , the differential antenna temperature observed at earth between this region and the cmb will be @xmath42 if the intergalactic gas has been significantly preheated , @xmath5 will be much larger than @xmath18 , and the igm will be observed in emission at a level that is independent of the exact value of @xmath5 . by contrast , when @xmath43 ( negligible preheating ) , the gas will appear in absorption , and @xmath44 will be a factor @xmath45 larger than in emission , so that it becomes relatively easier to detect intergalactic ( scott & rees 1990 ) .",
    "the presence of a sufficient flux of photons will thus render the neutral igm `` visible . '' without heating sources , the adiabatic expansion of the universe will lower the kinetic temperature of the igm well below that of the cmb , and the igm will be detectable through its absorption . if there are sources of radiation that preheat the igm , it may instead be possible to detect the igm in emission .",
    "the energetic demand for heating the igm above the cmb temperature is meager , only @xmath46 ev per particle at @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , even relatively inefficient heating mechanisms may be important warming sources well before the igm has been reionized .",
    "possible preheating sources are soft x  rays from an early generation of quasars or thermal bremsstrahlung emission produced by the ionized gas in the collapsed halos of young galaxies ( mmr ) . while photons emitted by a quasar just shortward of the photoelectric edge are absorbed at the ionization front , photons of much shorter wavelength will be able to propagate into the neutral igm much further .",
    "most of the photoelectric heating of the igm by a qso is accomplished by soft x ",
    "the timescale required for the radiation near the light front to heat the intergalactic gas to a temperature above that of the cmb is typically 10% of the hubble time .",
    "the region produced by a qso will therefore be preceded by a warming front .",
    "an additional heating source is the photon scattering itself ( mmr ) . the heating rate by the recoil of scattered photons is @xmath48 where @xmath30 is the scattering rate per hydrogen atom , and @xmath49 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . in the case of excitation at the thermalization rate @xmath50 , equation  ( [ eq : edot ] ) becomes @xmath51 the characteristic timescale for heating the medium above the cmb temperature via resonant scattering at this rate is @xmath52 about 20% of the hubble time at @xmath53 .",
    "this result has an important consequence : if a substantial population of sources of uv radiation turn on quite rapidly at ( say ) @xmath47 , there exists a finite interval of time during which photons couple the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the igm before heating the gas above the cmb ( reionization occurs at even later times ) . a window",
    "is then created in redshift space where a large fraction of intergalactic gas may be observed at @xmath54mhz in _ absorption _ against the cmb .",
    "we will show next how this transient phase may imprint a strong signature on the radio sky .",
    "numerical @xmath55body / hydrodynamics simulations of structure formation within the framework of cdm  dominated cosmologies ( cen 1994 ; zhang 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ; zhang 1998 ) have recently provided a definite picture for the topology of the igm at @xmath56 , one of an interconnected network of sheets and filaments with virialized systems located at their points of intersection . in between the filaments",
    "are underdense regions .",
    "this `` cosmic web '' appears to be a generic feature of cdm ( pogosyan 1998 ) , a pattern imprinted in the matter fluctuations at decoupling and sharpened by gravity . in a uv photoionizing background , modestly overdense filaments ( @xmath57 ) will give rise to the forest seen in the spectra of high redshift quasars .",
    "as discussed below , radio observations at meter wavelengths on several arcmin scales may probe the cosmic web at times prior to the epoch of reionization .",
    "because of the clumpiness of the igm , the 21cm optical depth of equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) will vary for different lines of sight . to estimate the _ rms _ level of brightness temperature fluctuations at @xmath38 cm , we shall consider three different cosmological models with parameters suggested by a variety of recent observations : an open model ( ocdm , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath9 ) , a flat model ( @xmath60cdm , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath9 ) , and an einstein  de sitter tilted model ( tcdm , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) . in all cases",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum or , equivalently , the value of the _ rms _ mass fluctuation in a @xmath68 mpc sphere , @xmath69 , has been fixed in order to reproduce the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters in the local universe ( e.g. eke 1998 ) .",
    "the tilted model has been designed to also match _ cobe _ measurements of the cmb on large scales .",
    "our choice of an open cdm cosmology ( with a normalization which is 2 _ rms _ away from the value observed by _ cobe _ ) is guided by the growing evidence in favour of a low value of @xmath70 from cluster studies ( e.g. carlberg 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath60dominated model matches both the cluster constraint on small scales and _ cobe _ constraint on large .",
    "it is also able to account for most known observational constraints , ranging from globular clusters ages to cmb anisotropies ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) to recent analyses of the type ia sne hubble diagram ( perlmutter 1998 ; riess 1998 ) , and just fits within the constraints imposed by gravitational lensing ( kochanek 1996 ; cooray 1999 ) . in all cosmologies the baryon density is @xmath71 ( burles & tytler 1998 ) .",

    "brightness temperature fluctuations will be present both in frequency and in angle across the sky . at high redshifts , and with a spatial resolution of @xmath85 arcmin",

    "it is also legitimate to assume that the baryons follow the dark matter , since segregation effects are important only on smaller scales .",

    "the detection thresholds are scaled according to a theoretical _ rms _ continuum noise in a 80  mhz bandwidth at 150  mhz of 64  njy over an 8 hour integration , allowing for only 21 of the 30 dishes in a compact array configuration ( taylor & braun 1999 ) , @xmath107 the central compact array in the ` straw man ' _ ska _ design proposal has a diameter of @xmath108  km in order to achieve 110 arcsec resolution . a more appropriate resolution for measuring fluctuations in the igm intensity",

    "each angular resolution observation corresponds to a different compact array diameter @xmath111 ( in other words , the array is being optimally resized to match its resolution to the desired angular scale ) .",
    "because the received flux is proportional to the solid angle of the beam , the signal decreases with decreasing angular scale until it falls below the detection threshold , indicated by the solid lines . with 100 hours of observation in a tcdm model",
    ", 2 @xmath3jy fluctuations will be detectable only on scales exceeding 3 arcmin .",

    "massive objects grow ` bottom  up '  low mass perturbations collapse early , then merge into progressively larger systems . in such a scenario ,",
    "one naturally expects the high redshift universe to contain small scale substructures , systems with a virial temperature well below @xmath120k .",
    "the resultant virialized systems will remain as neutral gas clouds unless they can cool due to molecular hydrogen , in which case they may form pop iii stars .",
    "these stars will produce a background of uv continuum photons near the frequency which will immediately escape into the igm , while at the same time ionizing the gas in their vicinity .",
    "photons will propagate into uncollapsed , largely neutral regions of the igm where the kinetic temperature in the absence of preheating will be @xmath121 ( couchman 1985 ) , well below @xmath18 because of adiabatic cooling during cosmic expansion .",
    "if pop iii sources are in sufficient abundance throughout the universe , the flux will couple the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature , and @xmath5 will be pulled below @xmath18 everywhere .",
    "after about @xmath122 yr ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : theat ] ) , the same photons responsible for the coupling will warm the igm to a temperature well above that of the cmb",
    ". eventually a sufficient number of photons above 1 ryd may be able to penetrate all of the surrounding neutral gas in the cloud , reach the external intergalactic gas , and create expanding intergalactic regions .",
    "the crucial assumption we make here is that the radiation field switches on at a redshift @xmath123 following the formation of the first stars , and reaches the thermalization value @xmath50 at @xmath124 on a timescale much shorter than the hubble time at that epoch .",
    "while in hierarchical models of structure formation the spatial number density of halos of a given mass grows initially exponentially ( press & schechter 1974 ) , the rise time of the uv radiation background will be modulated by gasdynamical processes . in the model of gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) , for instance ,",
    "a metagalactic flux is rapidly produced in the range @xmath125 . in this case coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath126 is almost instantaneous at @xmath127 , and the igm is suddenly detectable in absorption . for @xmath128 ,",
    "photons begin to heat the igm and the kinetic temperature increases at the rate @xmath129 until @xmath130 and the igm is now detectable in emission . here , @xmath131 is the mean molecular weight for a neutral gas with a fractional abundance by mass of hydrogen equal to 0.75 .",
    "such a chain of events will leave a strong imprint on the cmb , and mark the epoch of reheating by the first generation of stars . at 150 mhz ( @xmath132 ) , the brightness temperature ( shown in figure 4 ) shows an absorption feature of 40 mk , with a width of about 10 mhz .",
    "such a depression in the cmb is much easier to observe compared with brightness fluctuations , as the isotropic signal may be recorded with a larger beam area . assuming @xmath133 mk as a fiducial estimate , the signal  to  noise ratio for the _ ska _ is @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the frequency resolution",
    ", @xmath136 is the beam area in arcmin@xmath137 , and @xmath138 is the observation time . while the strength of this feature depends mainly on the timescale @xmath139 over which the continuum ly@xmath0 background field reaches the thermalization value , we have checked that the absorption dip is well above the detection limit for all timescales @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the then hubble time .",
    "note that similar sharp signatures in the radio background at meter wavelengths could also be produced at the reionization epoch , as recently discussed by gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) and shaver ( 1999 ) .",
    "very little is actually known observationally about the nature of the first bound objects and the thermal state of the universe at early epochs .",
    "if ionizing sources are uniformly distributed , like an abundant population of pregalactic stars , the ionization and thermal state of the igm will be the same everywhere at any given epoch , with the neutral fraction decreasing rapidly with cosmic time . as discussed above",
    ", this may be the case in cdm dominated cosmologies , since bound objects sufficiently massive ( @xmath142 ) to make stars form at high redshift .",
    "on the other hand , reionization may also occur in a highly inhomogeneous fashion , as widely separated but very luminous sources of photoionizing radiation such as qsos , present at the time the igm is largely neutral , generate expanding regions on mpc scales : the universe will be divided into an ionized phase whose filling factor increases with time , and an ever shrinking neutral phase . if the ionizing sources are randomly distributed , the regions will be spatially isolated at early epochs .",
    "in such a scenario , 21cm emission on mpc scales will be produced in the quasar neighborhood as the medium surrounding it is heated by soft x ",
    "rays from the qso itself ( mmr ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the ( differential ) radio map resulting from a qso ` sphere of influence ' soon after it turns on at @xmath104 ( tcdm ) . the kinetic temperature profile and radiation field around the quasar",
    "were computed including finite light travel time effects and heating by secondary electrons collisionally produced by primary electrons photo  ejected by the soft x  rays ( mmr ) .",
    "the specific luminosity of the qso was taken to be proportional to @xmath143 , normalized to a production rate of ionizing photons of @xmath144 .",
    "the igm was assumed uniform with @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the resulting radial temperature profiles were then superimposed on the surrounding density fluctuations as computed using hydra .",
    "the visual effect is due to the convolution of the spin temperature profile with the ( linearly ) perturbed density field around the quasar . outside the bubble",
    ", there is an inner thin shell of neutral gas where the igm is heated to @xmath147 as the hyperfine levels are mixed by continuum photons from the qso , and a much larger external shell where @xmath148 because of adiabatic cooling . at larger distances from the quasar the coupling strength is weakening as @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "as the warming front produced by the quasar expands , a growing amount of the surrounding igm is unveiled both in emission and in absorption . the size and intensity of the detectable 21cm region",
    "depend on the qso luminosity and age . in the figure the signal ranges from @xmath151jy to @xmath152jy per beam .",
    "note that , although the quasar was placed in a high density region in the corner of the simulation volume , the figure can equally be viewed as the emission due to heating by a beam of soft x  rays from the quasar with an opening angle of @xmath153 . thus imaging",
    "the gas surrounding a quasar in 21cm emission could provide a direct means of measuring the opening angle of quasar emission .",
    "the requirements for observing the epoch of igm reheating and reionization are a narrow bandwidth ( @xmath154 1 mhz ) , to achieve adequate resolution in velocity space at the relevant redshift , and an angular resolution of a few arcminutes , the typical scale of the expected density fluctuations .",
    "the straw man proposal for the _ ska _ suggests a large diameter for its central compact array in order to achieve a resolution of @xmath155 arcsec .",
    "while gas density fluctuations would persist to smaller scales in the igm , figure 2 shows that the associated signal would drop well below the threshold for a practical detection . for a successful experiment",
    "it is necessary to significantly decrease the diameter of the compact array .",
    "the current design for the _ ska _ ( and the _ gmrt _ ) has too widely distributed ` sub ",
    "apertures ' for a program oriented toward detecting arcmin scale structures .",
    "an alternative possibility is to build a compact , special purpose radio telescope dedicated to searching for the expected reheating and reionization signals at low frequencies . a single dish with a diameter of 200  m ( smaller than arecibo )",
    "would resolve scales of 30 arcminutes , corresponding to @xmath156 comoving mpc .",
    "this is comparable to the largest scale expected for coherent primordial density fluctuations ( pogosyan 1998 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that the expected brightness temperature fluctuations on this scale will be in excess of 1  mk .",
    "rms _ brightness temperature is given by the radiometer equation as @xmath157 ( burke & graham ",

    "if a density fluctuation filled the beam , it would be detectable at the @xmath106 level in a 300 hour integration .",
    "since such structures tend to be filamentary , a more typical covering factor may be @xmath160 , increasing the required integration time by a factor of 10 .",
    "this may be offset by increasing the bandwidth .",
    "the velocity width of a @xmath161 comoving mpc filament at @xmath104 corresponds to a frequency width at 150  mhz of about 8  mhz .",
    "a bandwidth of 5  mhz would then require an integration time of 500 hours .",
    "such a survey operating over several years would enable a substantial range in redshift to be probed .",
    "the history of the universe between the epoch of recombination and the birth of bright sources of radiation by @xmath162 is currently shrowded in mystery :  the absence of radiation sources leaves this period a `` dark age . ''",
    "yet spectra of qsos show not only metal absorption features in their spectra , the signature of ongoing and past star formation , but evidence for non  linear density fluctuations on large scales as well , a `` cosmic web '' in the form of the forest .    we have shown that it may be possible to detect both the development of the cosmic web and the epoch of the first radiation sources , whether stars or qsos , using 21cm measurements from intergalactic gas .",
    "prior to reionization , the radio signal will display emission and/or absorption structures both in angle across the sky and in redshift .",
    "fluctuations in 21cm emission will result from non  uniformities in the gas density and from non  uniformities in the distribution of radiation sources required to decouple the spin temperature from the cmb temperature . with an instrument like the _ square kilometre array _ , such fluctuations would be detectable on arminute scales , and so reveal whether the reheating is due to galaxies or qsos .",
    "absorption measurements may permit the epoch of the first stellar sources to be determined .",
    "the continuum radiation from an early generation of stars , redshifted to , will couple the spin temperature to the low kinetic temperature of the igm for a transitory interval before heating the gas above the cmb temperature .",
    "the result is a detectable absorption signature against the cmb that would flag the first epoch of massive star formation in the universe .",
    "if reheating were due to ultraluminous but sparsely distributed sources ( e.g. , the first bright qsos ) , the resultant patches would have a larger scale than any gravitationally  induced inhomogeneities . because of the very large scales involved , there is no difficulty in principle in achieving a sufficiently narrow bandwidth and an adequate angular resolution with the _ ska _ or _ gmrt _ ; the main limitations are the low flux levels and the radio background subtraction .",
    "alternatively , a special purpose telescope dedicated to scanning the sky in frequency along cold lines of sight through the galaxy may be used to detect the epochs of reheating .",
    "subsequent high resolution measurements with the _ ska _ would provide a means of identifying the nature of the first radiation sources and so shedding new light on the thermal and reionization history of the universe .    support for this work was provided by nasa through atp grant nag54236 ( pm , am , and pt ) , and by the royal society ( mjr ) . we thank the anonymous referee for clarifying the technical requirements needed for this project .",
