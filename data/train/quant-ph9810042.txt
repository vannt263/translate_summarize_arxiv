    "quantum mechanics is known to produce a variety of phenomena in lack of classical interpretation . in recent years",
    "the fields of quantum computation and quantum communication have tried to exploit these phenomena to propose computers and communication devices which are superior to their classical counterparts .",
    "one particular example is quantum teleportation which is based on the nonlocal features of the epr - paradox .",
    "quantum teleportation is transmission of qubits without actually sending the physical system , e.g. transfer of the state of an atom to another atom at a different location .",
    "classically teleportation can be performed by measuring the state of an object and sending the information to the receiver who reconstructs the state in a similar object . in the quantum world",
    "it is not that easy .",
    "quantum mechanics forbids us to gain exact knowledge of the state of an object . however , bennett et al .",
    "have suggested that it is still possible to perform teleportation@xcite , provided that the transmitting system does not retain any information about the state which is transmitted .",
    "recently quantum teleportation of a photonic state has been achieved experimentally @xcite .    in practical realizations of teleportation",
    "the system may be subject to noise in the transmission channels .",
    "recently , van enk et .",
    "al . have shown that the effect of the noise can be completely avoided , if we make suitable physical assumptions about the noise in the channels @xcite .",
    "eliminating noise on quantum information is considerably more complicated than eliminating noise on classical information because quantum mechanics forbids copying of information @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the state of a qubit ( @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "however , quantum mechanics does allow what we shall call a backup copy @xmath3 , where a single quantum system is transfered to a state with projections on two different subspaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are both equivalent to the initial state .",
    "( we use unnormalised states except where otherwise stated ) .",
    "we call it backup copying because if one half is `` lost '' ( projected out ) , say the @xmath5 part , we may still have the intact quantum state in the @xmath4 part . (",
    "the exact meaning of this statement will become clear below ) .",
    "in this paper we use the backup encoding to perform quantum communication in the presence of errors in the channel used for communication . rather than considering teleportation as discussed by van enk et .",
    ", we perform a perfect control - not operation , which is slightly more general than teleportation . to perform the operation we use off - resonant dispersive interactions between atoms and the transmitted photons .",
    "we assume that all errors are due to imperfections in the transmission between atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 and imperfections in the dispersive interaction , whereas measurements and unitary evolutions on a single atom are assumed ideal . with this assumption",
    "we show that our scheme works ideally even in the presence of a quite general class of errors .",
    "we emphasize that our scheme is not a conventional quantum error correcting code @xcite .",
    "we use a specific physical model of the noise to remove errors to all orders with a limited number of qubits whereas conventional error codes introduce new qubits to correct errors up to a certain order .",
    "the control - not gate works between two atoms or ions .",
    "the control atom is called @xmath6 and the target is called @xmath7 . here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two three level atoms , where each level has a two fold zeeman degeneracy ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the states of @xmath6 are denoted by @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the states of @xmath7 are called @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and 1 represents the azimuthal quantum numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 , see figure [ config ] . in practice , one may have recourse to systems with a different arrangement of states , but our procedures are most easily explained in the suggested realization .    if we consider the quantum information to be stored in the two zeeman degenerate ground state levels , the action of the control - not operation can be characterized by its action on suitable basis vectors for the atomic ground state @xmath18    \\begin{array}{cccc }      \\rightarrow\\\\      \\rightarrow\\\\      $ \\raisebox{-1ex}[0cm][0cm]{$\\searrow \\hspace{-1em } \\nearrow$}$\\\\       \\end{array }    \\left [      \\begin{array}{cccc }        |a_0\\rangle |d_0\\rangle\\\\        |a_0\\rangle |d_1\\rangle\\\\        |a_1\\rangle |d_1\\rangle\\\\        |a_1\\rangle |d_0\\rangle      \\end{array }    \\right].\\ ] ] the control - not operation interchanges the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xmath7 if and only if @xmath6 is in the state @xmath21 . a comment on notation : rather than considering the evolution of a superposition of the four basis vectors ( @xmath22 ) , we consider the evolution of each basis vector .",
    "this emphasizes that each vector in eq .",
    "[ cnot ] could be entangled with other qubits as in a computational task .",
    "our scheme consists of local encodings and two transmissions of photons from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "we begin with a local backup encoding on @xmath6 .",
    "we then perform the first transmission followed by a symmetrization on @xmath6 and protection of relevant states of @xmath7 .",
    "another transmission is performed and finally we extract the desired quantum states .    the effect of the transmissions is to entangle the levels of the two atoms .",
    "by performing local operations we can then use this entanglement to implement the control - not operation .",
    "the stability of our scheme arises from the horizontal symmetry among the atomic states in figure [ config ] . in the transmission",
    "we only use linearly ( @xmath23 ) polarized pulses which couple states vertically .",
    "this means that the photons contain no information about whether @xmath6 is in 0 or 1",
    ". the photons only contain information about the levels of @xmath6 .",
    "if , for instance , we start with a superposition @xmath24 and a photon is absorbed during a transmission , the wavefunction will collapse to some energy level ( for instance @xmath4 ) , but our quantum mechanical superposition between 0 and 1 will be intact ( @xmath25 ) . from this `` backup '' state",
    "we can start the transmission again and continue until we are successful .",
    "we first describe the evolution in the ideal situation where we have perfect error free transmissions .",
    "to perform the evolution described by eq .",
    "[ cnot ] we suggest using an experimental setup as shown in figure [ setup ] . our setup can be divided into a sending section , a receiving section and the channels connecting them .",
    "the sending section consist of a beam splitter , the atom @xmath6 and another beam splitter .",
    "the receiving part is the atom @xmath7 , a beam splitter and two photon detectors .",
    "all beam splitters are 50/50 .",
    "the channels are the two photon lines connecting the two sections . in a realistic implementation",
    "it might be preferable to use a delay rather than two distinct channels , but for the sake of clarity we apply two lines in our analysis .",
    "initially the qubits are stored in the ground states @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we first perform a local backup encoding on @xmath6 . with a linear @xmath28 pulse",
    "we take @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "we then perform the first photon transmission .",
    "a single linearly polarized photon is split into two orthogonal states @xmath31 and @xmath32 by a beam splitter .",
    "the field state @xmath31 interacts non - resonantly with the atom @xmath6 coupling the level @xmath5 with a detuning @xmath33 and a coupling constant g to a higher lying state in the atom .",
    "the energy shift of the level @xmath5 can be calculated in second order perturbation theory to be @xmath34 . if we choose an interaction time @xmath35 the phase of the state vector will change by @xmath23 if @xmath6 is in the level @xmath5 .",
    "a phase change of @xmath23 may not be realistic in an experiment , and we shall relax this assumption later .",
    "we then recombine the two photon amplitudes yielding the two states @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    the receiving atom @xmath7 is prepared with a linearly polarized @xmath28 pulse so that @xmath27 is taken to @xmath38 . the photon state @xmath39 now couples @xmath40 non - resonantly to a higher level yielding a conditional phase shift of @xmath23 as described for atom @xmath6 , and",
    "we then apply a second @xmath28 pulse so that if the field is in the @xmath41 state @xmath7 will be taken back to @xmath27 by the last pulse , but if the field is in the @xmath39 state @xmath7 will be taken to @xmath40 due to the phase change induced by the field .",
    "since the @xmath41 and @xmath39 states correspond to @xmath6 being in @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , this will create the desired entanglement between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but at this point the atoms are also entangled with the photon .",
    "we get rid of the photon with a quantum eraser : the two photon states @xmath41 and @xmath39 interfere yielding the two detector states @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we assume here that the mirrors are aligned so that @xmath42 corresponds to the incoming state @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we then perform a measurement revealing whether the photon is in @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath42 is measured we change the sign of the level @xmath5 to compensate a sign induced by the eraser .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the transmission performs the operation @xmath44 during transmission the zeeman degeneracy plays no role .",
    "subscripts i and j denoting the zeeman state have only been written for later convenience .    had we included the evolution of the level @xmath45 , the transmission would be a control - not between the levels @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath46 and @xmath45 , but this control- not will be vulnerable to errors .",
    "our backup scheme makes it possible to perform a perfect control - not between the states @xmath47 , @xmath21 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , also in the presence of errors .",
    "paradoxically this may be achieved by means of the transmission described by eq .",

    "our only requirement is that that the states @xmath12 and @xmath94 in @xmath7 are coupled only when @xmath6 is in level @xmath5 .",
    "we wish to emphasize another important feature of our proposal , well illustrated in figure [ extfig ] .",
    "the use of atoms with two plus two relevant states , rather than pairs of atoms with two times two states , offers a simple geometric picture of the transfer protocol , cf .",
    "in particular the diagonal extraction in figure [ extfig ] ( b ) .",
    "we believe that such pictures may be useful in the development of further ideas , not only for fault - tolerant transmission .    as an example , consider computation distributed on several quantum computers @xcite , with signalling atoms responsible for communication . following our proposal these atoms may be entangled vertically , prior to the calculation , and when ready for transmission , horizontal qubits may be communicated by the diagonal extraction procedure and other local operations .    also multi - particle entanglement may be accommodated following these lines .",
