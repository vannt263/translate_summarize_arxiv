    "the one dimensional dtqw protocol employed in recent experiments@xcite is depicted schematically in fig.[qwpicture]a .",
    "the basis states of the system are described in terms of the position of the `` walker , '' defined on integer lattice sites @xmath2 , and its internal `` spin '' state which can be either up ( @xmath3 ) or down ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the quantum evolution is produced by repeatedly applying a unitary operation @xmath5 that defines one `` step '' of the quantum walk .",
    "each step consists of a spin rotation @xmath6 , followed by a coherent spin - dependent translation @xmath7 \\label{translation}\\ ] ] that shifts the walker to the right ( left ) by one lattice site if its spin is up ( down ) .",
    "this step protocol is a unitary generalization of the classical process in which a random walker hops left or right according to the outcome of a stochastic `` coin - flip . '' here , as in the experiments of refs.@xcite , we consider the case where @xmath6 corresponds to a spin rotation around the @xmath8-axis through an angle @xmath9 , @xmath10    although the step protocol is defined explicitly in terms of the discrete unitary operations @xmath11 and @xmath6 , the net evolution over one step is equivalent to that generated by a time - independent effective hamiltonian @xmath12 over the step - time @xmath13 , @xmath14 the evolution operator for @xmath15 steps is given by @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the dtqw provides a stroboscopic simulation of the evolution generated by @xmath12 at the discrete times @xmath17 .",
    "below we take units in which @xmath18 .",
    "the dtqw protocol described above is translationally invariant .",
    "the evolution operator @xmath19 and the hamiltonian @xmath20 are thus diagonalized down to @xmath21 blocks in the basis of fourier modes , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . for the choice of @xmath6 in eq.([rotation ] ) , @xmath12 can be written as @xmath24\\otimes{|k\\rangle}{\\langle k|},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the vector of pauli matrices and the unit vector @xmath26 defines the quantization axis for the spinor eigenstates at each momentum @xmath27 . because the evolution is prescribed stroboscopically at unit intervals , the eigenvalues @xmath28 of @xmath12 are only determined up to integer multiples of @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding band structure is thus a `` quasi - energy '' spectrum , with @xmath29 periodicity in energy . for @xmath30 or @xmath29 ,",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 a typical band structure @xmath28 is shown in fig.[qwpicture]b .",
    "note that for @xmath35 or @xmath29 , the spectrum of @xmath36 is gapless and @xmath37 is ill - defined for @xmath38 .",
    "hamiltonians of the form ( [ hk ] ) can support topological phases if they possess certain symmetries , as indicated in fig.[toptable ] .",
    "the time - reversal and particle - hole symmetries of this table are defined by the existence of antiunitary operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 the hamiltonian @xmath12 given by eqs.([hk ] ) and ( [ nk ] ) possesses phs ( [ phs ] ) with @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the complex conjugation operator . to see this , note that the evolution operator @xmath44 given by eqs.([basicwalk]-[rotation ] ) is real , and thus invariant under @xmath43 . along with eq.([heff ] ) , this implies @xmath45 , which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ phs ] ) with @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , using eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) , it is straightforward to check that @xmath12 possesses a unitary `` chiral '' symmetry of the form @xmath46 with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is perpendicular to @xmath49 for all @xmath27 .",
    "the presence of both phs ( [ phs ] ) and chiral symmetry ( [ chiral ] ) guarantees that @xmath12 is invariant under trs ( [ trs ] ) with @xmath50 , see refs.@xcite .",
    "the symmetry classes identified in fig.[toptable ] are distinguished by whether the relevant symmetry operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 square to @xmath51 or @xmath52 . because here both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath12 belongs to the class of hamiltonians labeled `` ssh . ''",
    "the corresponding integer - valued topological invariant @xmath0 has a simple geometrical interpretation .",
    "chiral symmetry ( [ chiral ] ) constrains @xmath55 to lie on a plane which is perpendicular to @xmath56 , and which contains the origin ( see fig .",
    "[ qwpicture]c ) .",
    "thus , @xmath12 can be characterized by the number of times @xmath57 winds around the origin as @xmath27 runs from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . since the winding number of @xmath49 given by eq.([nk ] ) is 1 for all @xmath60 , the dtqws implemented in experiments @xcite simulate the @xmath61 ssh topological phase .",
    "the non - trivial topological character of the system can be revealed at a boundary between topologically distinct phases . to open the possibility to create such a boundary",
    ", we introduce the `` split - step '' dtqw protocol shown in fig.[rudnerwalk_scheme]a .",
    "starting from the dtqw defined by eq.([basicwalk ] ) , we split the translations of the spin - up and spin - down components , and insert an additional spin - rotation @xmath62 around the @xmath8-axis in between : @xmath63 where @xmath64 shifts the walker to the right ( left ) by one lattice site if its spin is up ( down ) .",
    "the split - step protocol defines a family of effective hamiltonians @xmath65 parametrized by the two spin - rotation angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this family realizes both @xmath68 and @xmath69 ssh topological phases as displayed in fig.[rudnerwalk_scheme]b , with chiral symmetry ( [ chiral ] ) given by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( see methods ) .",
    "gapped phases with winding numbers @xmath68 and @xmath69 are separated by phase transition lines where the quasi - energy gap closes at either @xmath73 or @xmath74 , as indicated in the figure .",
    "we propose to create a phase boundary in the dtqw by replacing the second ( spatially - uniform ) spin rotation @xmath62 of eq.([splitstep ] ) with a site - dependent spin rotation @xmath75 $ ] , which rotates the walker s spin through an angle @xmath76 about the @xmath8-axis at each site @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , we consider the situation where @xmath77 for @xmath78 and changes monotonically to @xmath79 for @xmath80 ( see fig.[rudnerwalk_scheme]c ) .",
    "although this protocol is not translationally - invariant , symmetries ( [ trs]-[chiral ] ) are preserved . in particular",
    ", the system retains the chiral symmetry under @xmath81 for arbitrary @xmath76 as long as @xmath66 remains uniform .",
    "when the rotation angles @xmath82 and @xmath83 are chosen to realize topologically distinct phases with @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the regions @xmath78 and @xmath80 , a bound state with energy @xmath84 or @xmath59 exists near the phase boundary @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a bound state is guaranteed by topology , and does not depend on the details of the boundary .",
    "the bound state can be probed by initializing the walker at @xmath85 as demonstrated in fig.[rudnerwalk_scheme]d .",
    "because this initial state has a non - vanishing overlap with the bound state , part of the walker s wavepacket will remain localized near @xmath85 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the pairs @xmath82 , @xmath83 are chosen to lie within the same `` diamond''-shaped region of fig.[rudnerwalk_scheme]b , then the system can be made spatially uniform through a continuous deformation of the hamiltonian without closing either gap at @xmath86 or @xmath87 . in this case , there are no topologically protected modes localized at the boundary . for monotonic @xmath76 ,",
    "this guarantees that the system does not support _ any _ bound states , and the probability to find the walker at @xmath88 decays to zero with an increasing number of dtqw steps ( see fig.[rudnerwalk_scheme]e ) .    with further modifications to the dtqw protocol , each of the topological classes in 1d given in fig.[toptable ] can be realized ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "in addition , as we will now discuss , a straightforward extension of the protocol to a higher - dimensional lattice allows the dtqw to simulate topological phases in two dimensions .",
    "to begin , we consider a family of 2d quantum walks in which the walker possesses two internal states as in the 1d dtqws above .",
    "non - trivial topological phases can be realized in a variety of 2d lattice geometries .",
    "here we consider the case of a triangular lattice , and discuss equivalent square lattice realizations in the supplementary material .",
    "one step of the quantum walk is defined by the unitary operation @xmath89 where @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) translates the walker with spin up ( down ) in the @xmath92(@xmath93)@xmath94 direction , with @xmath95 defined in fig.[triangularwalk]a .",
    "the net result of eq.(11 ) is to make the walker hop between sites of a superlattice defined by twice the primitive unit cell .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for this 2d dtqw takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ hk ] ) with the integration over @xmath96 taken over the 2d brillouin zone ( bz ) of the superlattice .",
    "we now study the topological properties of the 2d dtqws defined by eq.([u_triangular ] ) .",
    "the corresponding effective hamiltonians lack time - reversal symmetry , and are thus contained in the symmetry classes in the bottom row of fig.[toptable ] .",
    "because @xmath97 is real , this system possesses phs with @xmath71 ( see above ) . with a slight modification ,",
    "this symmetry can be broken and phases in the class labeled iqh in fig.[toptable ] can also be realized ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "these phases are analogous to those of the haldane model@xcite , which exhibits an integer quantum hall effect in the absence of a net magnetic field .",
    "the phases realized by the 2d dtqw , eq.([u_triangular ] ) , are characterized by an integer - valued topological invariant called the first chern number .",
    "this quantity is defined in terms of the unit vector @xmath98 , see eq.([hk ] ) , as @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "geometrically , the chern number is equal to the number of times @xmath98 covers the unit sphere as @xmath100 is taken over the 2d brillouin zone .",
    "we have numerically calculated chern numbers for 2d dtqws throughout the full range of spin - rotation angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( see methods ) .",
    "as shown in fig.[triangularwalk]b , phases with @xmath101 and with @xmath102 can be realized .",
    "similar to the 1d case , non - trivial topology in 2d dtqws is manifested in the presence of protected mid - gap modes bound to the interface between two topologically distinct phases .",
    "these gapless modes are analogous to the chiral edge modes of quantum hall systems , and are robust against perturbations . to confirm the existence of such edge modes , we have used numerical diagonalization to study a non - uniform 2d dtqw on a 100@xmath103100 site triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions , see fig.[triangularwalk]c .",
    "we take the spin - rotation angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 in eq.([u_triangular ] ) to be site - dependent , with @xmath104 chosen to realize the @xmath105 phase inside the red strip @xmath106 , and @xmath107 chosen to realize the trivial @xmath108 phase outside .",
    "the quasi - energy spectrum is plotted in fig.[triangularwalk]d as a function of the conserved momentum component @xmath109 parallel to the interface .",
    "two counter - propagating chiral edge modes exist inside the bulk gap .",
    "these modes are separately localized at the two boundaries between the @xmath101 and @xmath110 phases , as indicated in fig.[triangularwalk]c .",
    "as described above for 1d , these chiral edge modes can be probed by performing the spatially inhomogeneous 2d dtqw described above with the walker initialized at the boundary between two topologically distinct phases . because a general state localized near the phase boundary has a non - zero overlap with the chiral edge mode , part of the walker s wavepacket",
    "will propagate unidirectionally along the boundary .",
    "such unidirectional propagation is protected by topology , and hence is robust even in the presence of an irregularly - shaped boundary .",
    "finally , we present a time - reversal - invariant 2d dtqw with @xmath111 , which can realize the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) phase ( see fig.[toptable ] ) .",
    "the realization of this phase requires the presence of at least four bands , which contain two pairs of time - reversed partners .",
    "therefore , we now consider a dtqw where the walker possesses four internal states ( e.g. a four - level atom , see also experiment @xcite ) .",
    "we label these four states by a `` spin '' index @xmath112 , which takes the values @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and a `` flavor '' index @xmath113 which takes the values @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the time - reversal - invariant unitary step operator @xmath116 is constructed in a block - diagonal form , @xmath117 where @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) only acts on the walker if its flavor index is equal to @xmath114 @xmath120 . by fixing @xmath121 ,",
    "we ensure that @xmath116 is invariant under the trs operation @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a pauli matrix which acts on the flavor index . as an example , if @xmath118 is chosen according to eq .",
    "( [ u_triangular ] ) , then @xmath124 .",
    "note that @xmath125 translates the walker in the direction @xmath93(@xmath92)@xmath94 if its spin is up ( down ) ; i.e. @xmath126 acts opposite to @xmath90 .",
    "time - reversal invariant systems in 2d with @xmath111 are characterized by a @xmath1 topological invariant ( middle row of right panel in fig.[toptable ] ) . if @xmath66 and @xmath67 are chosen such that @xmath118 is characterized by an odd chern number , then @xmath127 realizes a qsh phase with the @xmath1 invariant equal to @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the effective hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath116 conserves the flavor index @xmath113 and as a result supports topological phases classified by an integer @xmath0 , rather than the binary invariant @xmath1 .",
    "however , this additional symmetry can be broken by introducing a coupling between @xmath114 and @xmath115 states which preserves trs . in this way ,",
    "the generic @xmath1 classification can be retrieved ( see supplementary materials ) .",
    "because the edge modes bound to interfaces between topologically distinct phases in 1d and 2d are topologically protected , their existence is expected to be robust against a broad range of perturbations which may arise in real experiments . in particular , their existence is insensitive to the details of the boundaries , which may be sharp or smooth , straight or curved ( in 2d ) , etc . in some cases ,",
    "the topological protection arises from certain symmetries ( e.g. chiral symmetry in the 1d examples above ) .",
    "however , even if these symmetries are slightly broken by small errors in the spin - rotation axes and/or angles , the edge states are expected to persist due to the absence of nearby states inside the bulk energy gap .    throughout this work ,",
    "we have focused on signatures of topological phases in single - particle dynamics . however",
    ", some dramatic manifestations of topological order , e.g. charge fractionalization and the quantization of the hall conductivity , appear for specific many - body states such as the `` filled - band '' ground states of fermionic systems . to observe these phenomena in dtqws with multiple walkers",
    ", analogous many - body states can be prepared schematically as follows . for special choices of the dtqw parameters , the bloch eigenstates are simple , i.e. local in space , and uniform in spin . by preparing a single filled band comprised of such states",
    ", more complicated filled band states can be obtained through a quasi - adiabatic evolution in which the dtqw parameters are changed slightly from step to step .",
    "even if an energy gap closes along the way , the number of excitations created in the process can be controlled by the effective sweep rate . in this way , many - body aspects of topological phases may also be studied using dtqws .    in this paper , we have shown that discrete time quantum walks provide a unique setting in which to realize topological phases in 1d and 2d . with only slight modifications to the quantum walk protocol which was realized in recent experiments ,",
    "the entire `` periodic table '' of topological insulators @xcite in one and two dimensions can be explored .",
    "in addition , we have provided a method to detect the presence of topological phases through the appearance of robust edge states at boundaries between topologically distinct phases .",
    "recently , several promising system - specific methods have been proposed to realize topological phases using cold - atoms @xcite , polar molecules@xcite , or photons@xcite .",
    "our work advances this emerging field by providing a general framework for studying topological phases in a wide variety of available experimental systems including cold - atoms , trapped ions and photons . by extending this work to three dimensions",
    ", it may be possible to realize new topological phases , such as the hopf insulator@xcite , which have not yet been explored in condensed matter systems .",
    "in addition , multi - particle generalizations of discrete time quantum walks will open new avenues in which to explore the quantum many - body dynamics of interacting fermionic or bosonic systems .",
    "the unitary evolution of the 1d split - step dtqw , eq.([splitstep ] ) , is generated by a hamiltonian of the form of eq.([hk ] ) with @xmath128 , and @xmath129 it is straightforward to check that @xmath130 is perpendicular to @xmath131 for all @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the system possesses chiral symmetry ( [ chiral ] ) with @xmath132 . as a result",
    ", the split - step dtqw can be characterized by the winding number of @xmath131 around the origin , denoted by @xmath0 . using the explicit expression for @xmath131 in eq .",
    "( [ splitstepn ] ) , we find @xmath69 if @xmath133 , and @xmath68 if @xmath134 .",
    "the spectrum is gapless along the lines @xmath135 .",
    "thus we obtain the phase diagram displayed in fig .",
    "[ rudnerwalk_scheme ] ( b ) .",
    "in addition to the dynamical simulations presented in the main text , we have confirmed the existence of topologically protected edge states with energy @xmath86 or @xmath136 in the 1d split - step dtqw through an analytical calculation for an infinite system with a _",
    "boundary , using @xmath137 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , we have used numerical diagonalization to study the spectrum of a finite ( periodic ) system on a ring which hosts two phase boundaries . in all cases",
    ", we find that if the phases on the two sides of a boundary are topologically distinct , i.e. characterized by different winding numbers @xmath0 , then a single localized state with energy @xmath86 or @xmath87 exists at the boundary .    for _ smooth _ boundaries as described in the main text , other localized states that are not protected by topology could appear .",
    "these bound states always appear in pairs with energies @xmath141 and @xmath142 due to chiral symmetry .",
    "therefore , when the phases on the two sides of a boundary are topologically distinct , an odd number of bound states appears at the phase boundary@xcite .",
    "here we briefly describe a general procedure for determining the phase diagrams of 2d dtqws .",
    "because the value of a quantized topological invariant can only change across a phase boundary where a gap closes , we first identify the lines in parameter space along which a gap vanishes in the quasi - energy spectrum .",
    "once these phase boundaries are determined , the topological phases between boundaries can be identified by computing the topological invariant at any single point within each region . for the 2d dtqw with evolution operator given by eq.([u_triangular ] ) , we have obtained phase boundaries analytically from the spectrum @xmath143 which gives the lines shown in fig .",

    "in this section , we provide explicit dtqw protocols which can be used to realize topological phases in each of the symmetry classes listed in fig.1 of the main text .",
    "these protocols are summarized in supplementary fig.[table ] .",
    "each dtqw presented in fig.[table ] can realize both trivial and non - trivial phases within a given symmetry class . the specific phase which is realized is determined by the spin rotation angles which parametrize the quantum walk ; the system can be driven through a topological phase transition by tuning these spin rotation angles . in the following ,",
    "we denote the presence of time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) with @xmath145 by trs@xmath146 , and the absence of time - reversal symmetry by trs@xmath147 .",
    "similarly , we denote the presence of particle - hole symmetry ( phs ) with @xmath148 by phs@xmath149 , and its absence by phs@xmath147 .",
    "we denote the presence of chiral symmetry under the unitary operator @xmath150 by ch=1 , and its absence by ch=0 .",
    "note that because the chiral symmetry operator @xmath150 is _ unitary _ , rather than _ antiunitary _ , the phase of its square does not carry any additional information .",
    "in particular the transformation @xmath151 results in @xmath152 .",
    "for all of the dtqws considered below , the presence of any two of the symmetries \\{trs , phs , ch } automatically ensures the presence of the third .",
    "for example , if a system possesses phs and ch under the operators @xmath40 and @xmath150 , then it also possess trs under the operator @xmath153 .",
    "quantum walks with trs@xmath154 can be readily constructed from dtqws with trs=0 through the `` doubling procedure '' used to construct @xmath155[eq.(12 ) ] in the main text .",
    "first the walker is endowed with an additional two - fold `` flavor '' index @xmath113 which can take either the value @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "we then choose an evolution operator which is diagonal in the flavor index and which satisfies @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the evolution operator which acts on the walker with flavor @xmath114(@xmath115 ) . with this possibility in mind ,",
    "below we focus on examples with trs=0 .",
    "the split - step dtqw described by eq.(10 ) of the main text realizes the symmetry class with trs=@xmath51 , phs=@xmath51 , ch=@xmath51 . by an appropriate change of the direction of the spin - rotation axes , trs and phs",
    "can be broken while ch is retained . thus in order to realize the related symmetry class trs=@xmath84 , phs=@xmath84 , ch=@xmath51 , we will break the phs of the split - step dtqw . in the main text we showed that any dtqw whose unitary evolution operator is _ real _ possesses phs with @xmath71 , where @xmath43 is the complex conjugation operator .",
    "the existence of phs is in fact more general : if the two spin - rotations in a split - step dtqw are performed around the same axis , and if that axis lies in the @xmath159-plane , then the dtqw will have phs=1 . to see this ,",
    "suppose that both rotations are performed around the axis @xmath160 .",
    "it is then straightforward to check that the resulting effective hamiltonian possesses phs under the operator @xmath161 .    on the other hand ,",
    "phs is absent if we choose a rotation axis that contains a non - zero @xmath162 component .",
    "an example of a dtqw with phs=0 is provided by the evolution operator @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a spin - rotation around the axis @xmath165 through the angle @xmath9 .",
    "although phs is absent , this system possesses chiral symmetry under the symmetry operator @xmath166 , where @xmath167 .",
    "the absence of trs can be checked in the following way .",
    "if the energy eigenvalues of the two states with momentum @xmath27 are given by @xmath168 , then trs@xmath146 requires @xmath169 .",
    "we have explicitly checked that this relation is not satisfied for the dtqw defined by eq.([uv ] ) , and thus conclude that trs is absent .",
    "the split - step dtqw above , eq.([uv ] ) , can realize distinct topological phases by tuning the spin - rotation angle @xmath170 .",
    "for example , the trivial phase with winding number @xmath68 is realized with @xmath171 and @xmath172 and the phase with winding number @xmath69 is realized with @xmath171 and @xmath173 .    the recent experimental implementation of a dtqw with photons@xcite employed the rotation operator given by the hadamard gate @xmath174 , with @xmath175 .",
    "since the rotation axis contains a non - zero @xmath162 component , we conclude that this `` hadamard walk '' belongs to the symmetry class trs=@xmath84 , phs=@xmath84 , ch=@xmath51 .    using the doubling procedure described above , a time - reversal symmetric dtqw with trs=@xmath52 , phs=@xmath52 , and ch=@xmath51",
    "can be constructed based on the dtqw defined in eq .",
    "( [ uv ] ) . the corresponding evolution for one step of the dtqw",
    "is given by @xmath176 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to check that this quantum walk possesses chiral symmetry under the operator @xmath177 $ ] . by construction",
    ", this dtqw possesses trs@xmath154 with @xmath178 . using these two symmetries",
    ", we construct a phs operator @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "the construction of a dtqw with trs=@xmath84 , phs=@xmath51 , ch=@xmath84 starts from the split - step dtqw with trs=@xmath51 , phs=@xmath51 , ch=@xmath51 [ see main text , eq . (",
    "the chiral symmetry can be broken by adding extra operations to the split - step dtqw .",
    "on the other hand , in the previous section we showed that phs can be retained quite generally as long as the two rotation axes are the same and taken to lie on @xmath159-plane .",
    "in order to construct a dtqw with ch=@xmath84 , we begin with eq.(10 ) and add an additional spin - dependent translation @xmath11 which translates the walker to the right(left ) by one lattice site if its spin is up(down ) [ see eq.(2 ) ] .",
    "explicitly , the evolution operator for one step of a representative dtqw from this symmetry class is given by @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a spin - rotation around the @xmath8 axis through an angle @xmath9 [ eq.(3 ) ] .",
    "since @xmath184 is real , this dtqw retains phs=1 with @xmath71 .",
    "the absence of chiral symmetry for this walk can be verified by observing that the quantization axis @xmath131 does not lie on a plane which includes the origin .",
    "therefore , no single operator @xmath150 can be found which satisfies @xmath185 for all @xmath27 .",
    "one dimensional systems with particle - hole symmetry exhibit two distinct topological phases@xcite .",
    "these two phases are indexed by the berry phase , which can only take the quantized values @xmath84 and @xmath59 due to the presence of phs .",
    "explicitly , the invariant is given by @xmath186 here , @xmath187 is the eigenstate in `` lower band '' with momentum @xmath27 .",
    "the dtqw described above can realize both topological phases , with the trivial phase ( @xmath188 ) realized for @xmath189 , and the non - trivial phase with @xmath190 realized for @xmath191 .    using the doubling procedure",
    ", we can construct a time - reversal invariant dtqw with trs=@xmath52 , phs=1 , ch=1 based on eq .",
    "( [ uch0 ] ) .        the triangular lattice 2d dtqw defined by eq.(11 ) of the main text involves only spin rotations around the @xmath8-axis .",
    "consequently , the evolution operator @xmath97 is real and possesses phs=@xmath51 with @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the time - reversal invariant dtqw @xmath155 constructed from @xmath192 , eq.(12 ) , is contained in the symmetry class trs=@xmath52 , phs=@xmath51 , ch=@xmath51 .    as noted in the main text ,",
    "@xmath155 is diagonal in the flavor index @xmath193 and thus possess an extra symmetry related to the conservation of @xmath194 .",
    "here we describe a more general 2d dtqw with trs=@xmath52 which does not possess this additional symmetry .",
    "the operator for one step of this modified time - reversal invariant dtqw is given by @xmath195 where @xmath196 acts on the walker if its flavor index is @xmath197 .",
    "the rotation @xmath198 explicitly introduces mixing between the @xmath114 and @xmath115 flavors , and thus breaks the conservation of @xmath199 .",
    "this dtqw is characterized by trs=@xmath52 with the symmetry operator @xmath178 if @xmath200 is chosen according to @xmath201 .",
    "if the chern number associated with @xmath202 is odd , then @xmath203 with @xmath204 realizes a non - trivial qsh topological phase . because this phase is protected by trs",
    ", the presence of a small @xmath205 can not take the system out of this phase .",
    "the existence of topological phases characterized by a non - zero chern number does not rely on the presence of phs .",
    "therefore , the topological phase with chern number @xmath51 in the trs=@xmath84 , phs=@xmath51 , cs=@xmath84 symmetry class can be directly transformed to the corresponding phase in the trs=@xmath84 , phs=@xmath84 , cs=@xmath84 symmetry class by a perturbation which breaks phs .",
    "such a perturbation can be achieved by changing the rotation axis for the second rotation stage in eq.(11 ) .",
    "the resulting dtqw single - step evolution operator is given by @xmath206 where @xmath207 is a spin rotation around the @xmath8 axis , and @xmath208 is a spin rotation around the axis @xmath209 with @xmath210 .",
    "the operators @xmath211 correspond to spin - dependent translations along the directions @xmath212 , as defined in fig.4a .",
    "the absence of phs is confirmed by examining the relationship between energy eigenvalues @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "the presence of phs implies @xmath215 .",
    "this condition is violated for dtqw ( [ u_2d_p ] ) .",
    "therefore this system does not possess phs .",
    "dtqw ( [ u_2d_p ] ) realizes both topologically trivial and non - trivial phases with zero and nonzero chern numbers .",
    "for example , the choice @xmath216 generates the phase with chern number @xmath52 , while @xmath217 corresponds to the phase with chern number @xmath84 .",
    "since phs is absent , this dtqw belongs to the class with trs=0 , phs=0 , cs=0 .",
    "the related time - reversal invariant dtqw constructed by applying the doubling procedure to this walk has trs@xmath154 , phs=0 , ch=0 .",
    "quantum walks with phs=@xmath52 can be constructed through a doubling procedure similar to that used to construct dtqws with trs=@xmath52 .",
    "consider the block - diagonal evolution operator @xmath218 where @xmath196 acts on the walker if its flavor index is @xmath197 .",
    "if we choose @xmath219 , then the resulting dtqws possess phs=@xmath52 with @xmath220 . by choosing @xmath202 according to eq.([u_2d_p ] ) with parameters to give a chern number of @xmath51 , eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) produces a dtqw which realizes a non - trivial topological phase in the symmetry class trs=0 , phs=@xmath52 , ch=0 .",
    "in the main text , we have provided examples of 2d dtqws which realize topological phases on a triangular lattice . however , these dtqws can also be implemented on a square lattice , as we explain below .",
    "a square lattice may be easier to realize in some experimental implementations , such as cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "generally speaking , the phase diagram of a dtqw is determined by the amplitude for the walker to hop from one site to another after one complete step of the evolution .",
    "thus , as long as the hopping amplitudes between all pairs of sites are preserved , geometrical deformations of the lattice do not change the phase diagram .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram of a dtqw is insensitive to geometric deformations of its host lattice .",
    "in particular , 2d dtqws with non - zero chern number can be realized on a square lattice by replacing the translations along the vectors @xmath212 on the triangular lattice in eq.(11 ) with the vectors @xmath221 shown in fig.[squarelattice ] . here , @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "this protocol is obtained simply by `` shearing '' the lattice used in eq.(11 ) and fig.4a .",
    "note that the diagonal translation along @xmath225 can be implemented by a compound translation along @xmath226 followed by a translation along @xmath227 ."
