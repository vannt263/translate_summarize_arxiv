    "tools have been inspiring and pedestalling the development in fundamental electronics , in parallel with experimental means , ever since the birth of this scientific branch .",
    "memristors were first postulated theoretically by l. o. chua in 1971 ingeniously on the observation of formal symmetries in the mathematical links among four elementary electronic quantities , and was proved on the ground of electromagnetics@xcite .",
    "the concept was revived by the realization of the titanium dioxide memristor in 2008@xcite , which has been responded by massive studies .",
    "consequently , the mathematical structure of passive electronic elements has been extended to a large family consisting of memristive , memcapacitive and meminductive systems@xcite@xcite . and",
    "recently , the class of heterogeneous memristive systems has further broadened the concept from the prevailing homogeneous systems@xcite . despite of the richness in the structures , the understanding of memristive systems",
    "is still far less accurate and systematic , as compared to the existing theories of bjt or mos transistors .",
    "this is mainly caused by the lack of proficient tools in solving the governing nonlinear differential equations .",
    "in fact , since the emergence of the titanium dioxide memristor , the dynamics of various systems have been mainly studied by numerical simulations .",
    "this is due to the rarity of integrable models ( models that are solvable in the closed form ) in memrisitve systems , unlike the cases of the various long - existing transistors , governed by algebraic equations .",
    "numerical simulations have the merits of flexibility and versatility , but also suffer from the drawback that the physical relations of dominating factors to the dynamics can only be determined empirically or remain undetermined . in contrast",
    ", solutions in the closed form can offer the insight in such relations and render the behaviors reasonable and predictable . in this paper , we give the analytical solution to the titanium dioxide memristor with arbitary order of window functions , which takes into account the nonlinear ionic drift model . we demonstrate that the characteristic curve of state , as the achieved solution , is a useful tool in determining the operation point , waveform and saturation level , similar to the characteristic curve for bjt or mos transisitors . at the meantime , a natural question is proposed whether there can be some classes of memristor models in general that are solvable or conditionally solvable in closed form . in ref.@xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors heading for this question pioneered in proposing a class of memristive systems that conform to bernoulli differential equations and argued that all current- or voltage - controlled memristors are classified therein .",
    "however , due to the implicit dependence of the memristance @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) on the current ( voltage ) , this argument is only true for very special cases , _",
    "e.g. _ , the titanium dioxide memristor based on linear ionic drift model .",
    "we propose another class of ( conditionally ) solvable memristive systems that conform to ( generalized ) abel differential equations .",
    "the equations of state of the titanium dioxide memristor based on both linear and nonlinear ionic drift models are typical integrable examples , which can be categorized into this abel memristor class .",
    "the titanium dioxide memristor , based on the mechanism of tunable doped region , was first implemented by b. strukov , _ et al _ , and was formulated with a linear ionic drift model@xcite",
    ". however , the linear model fails in revealing the boundary effects , which should differ the rate of the change in the size of the doped region in the bulk from that at the boundary . to overcome this serious drawback , y. n. joglekar , _ et al _ ,",
    "proposed a nonlinear ionic drift model in @xcite , which modifies the linear drift equation with a window function of defined orders @xmath3 : @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "it characterizes a milder drop in the rate of the dopant scale @xmath6 at the boundaries with a smaller @xmath3 , while a sharper drop with a larger @xmath3 .",
    "the entire set of equations describing the dynamics therefore reads as    [ tm ] @xmath7 i(t )   \\label{tm1}\\\\       & \\frac{dw(t)}{dt}=\\frac{\\mu_v r_{on } } d i(t ) f\\left(\\frac{w(t ) } d\\right )   \\label{tm2 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is an analytically solvable model . by eliminating @xmath8 in eq .",

    "in fact , the eos corresponding to different values of @xmath3 can be categorized into a class of abel differential equations@xcite .",
    "when @xmath12 , eq . ( [ wt ] ) is an abel equation of the second kind , which conforms to the equation @xmath13\\frac{dy(t ) } { dt}=f_2(t)y(t)^2+f_1(t)y(t)+f_0(t)\\ ] ] when @xmath14 , it is a generalized abel equation in the form of @xmath15\\frac{dy(t ) } { dt}&=&f_{m-1}(t)y(t)^{m-1}+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+f_2(t)y(t)^2+f_1(t)y(t)+f_0(t)\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there have been solutions to vast forms of the abel equations and well - established qualitative analysis tools .",
    "however , one can observe that the abel equation in eq .",
    "( [ wt ] ) has a special form , which can be integrated directly by variable seperation . making use of the special integral ( for @xmath16 ) in the hypergeometric form @xmath17,\\left[1+\\frac 1 m\\right],z^m\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the gaussian hypergeometric function ( also known as the ( 2 , 1)-ordered generalized hypergeometric function)@xcite , the general solution to eq .

    "numerical simulations , though flexible and versatile , are not proficient to reveal the inner relation between the parameters and the phase - planar dynamics .",
    "critical questions , such as how the initial condition plays a role in the dynamics , which is crucial to a nonlinear system , and what determines exactly the deviation of the @xmath0 orbital shape from a standard hyteretic loop , remain unexplained . the @xmath46 curve in the closed form , as given in eq . ( [ ser ] ) , which we name as the _ characteristic curve of state _ , provides a useful tool for characterizing the dynamics of the memristor , which can determine the operation point , amplitude , waveform and saturation level , as using the characteristic curve in analyzing bjt or mos transistors .",
    "the procedure is explained as follows :    suppose that the input voltage signal is @xmath47 , which corresponds to a flux band with the width of @xmath48 . for memristors ,",
    "two factors are needed to determine the dynamical behavior of the nonlinear system : the input signal and the initial condition .",
    "we can see that the initial condition for the titanium oxide memristor actually functions as an operation point .",
    "the analytical solution in eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) indicates that different initial conditions @xmath38 are represented as a translation of the characteristic curve @xmath49 , which determines the intersection of the characteristic curve and the input flux band . when the steeper part of the curve is within the interval @xmath50 $ ] , the input signal @xmath20 is mapped onto the dopant scale @xmath9 with a larger amplitude ; and vice versa .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath9 determines directly the change in the memristance @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) and hence the shape of the @xmath0 orbital shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ) .",
    "similar to the case in transistors , the characteristic curve also reveals the saturation level in @xmath9 , as it occurs , for example , in the upper peaks ( @xmath52 ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "in fact , the saturation in @xmath9 will result in a deformation of the @xmath0 orbital shape ( see the triangular shaped orbit with a sharper negative resistance in fig . [ fig1](d ) for @xmath41 ) , as compared with a standard - shaped hysteretic loop ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) for @xmath53 ) .",
    "it is of special interest that the same input signal can output completely different @xmath0 orbital dynamics under different initial conditions , which is the uniqueness of memristors !    the narrowing of the @xmath0 orbital shape is usually observable when raising the operation frequency@xcite .",
    "however , the above analysis implies that this phenomenon can also be obtained by varying the initial condition .",
    "it is preceivable that a sufficiently large input signal will cause saturation on both upper and lower peaks ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) in @xmath9 , which will produce a heavier deformation in the @xmath0 orbit .",
    "the drastic difference in orbital shapes reminds us that to control the initial condition properly is critical in the correct operation of memristors , which is highly related to the reliability of memristive networks .",
    "in fact , this characterizing method can be well regarded as an analogy of using the characteristic curve in transistors for similar purposes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , in which the output signal @xmath44 or @xmath45 encounters saturation when the operation point @xmath56 on the load line is close to the saturation region of the transistor . therefore ,",
    "with the characteristic curve @xmath46 in the closed form , one is able to determine the main characteristics of the dynamics of the memristor prior to amounts of numerical simulations in the same manner as for transistors .",
    "as researchers have seen that analytical solutions can offer a deterministic characterizing tool for memristive systems , a natural question is raised whether there can be certain classes of analytically solvable memristive systems .",
    "this problem was first addressed by p. georgious , _ et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , an argument was made that any current - controlled memristor(similar for the case of voltage - controlled memristor ) belongs to the class of bernoulli memristive systems .",
    "more specifically , the nonlinear first order ordinary differential equation of the memristor on the current @xmath8 : @xmath57 \\frac{i^2(t)}{v(t)}\\ ] ] is argued to conform to a bernouli differential equation , in the general form of @xmath58 where @xmath1 denotes the current - controlled memristance . as demonstrated in the referred papers@xcite@xcite ,",
    "this classification is correct for the titanium dioxide memristor based on linear ionic drift model as a current - controlled memristor@xcite .",
    "however , this argument is not valid in general , due to the implicit dependence of the memristance @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) on the current ( voltage ) .",
    "the titanium dioxide memristor model with nonlinear dopant drift , discussed in the last section , is a typical system beyond this category , despite of its current - controlled memristive nature . to see this point ,",
    "it is noticeable that the relation between the charge @xmath59 and the dopant scale @xmath6 is modified by a hypergeometric factor for @xmath60 : @xmath61,\\left[1+\\frac 1 { 2p}\\right],\\left(\\frac{2w } d-1\\right)^{2p}\\right)+b , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is an integration constant . noting the relation in eq .",

    "( [ qw ] ) , the right - handside of eq .",
    "( [ mqphi ] ) has a dependence on the unsolved @xmath9 .",
    "henceforth , the @xmath0 behavior of the system does not conform to a bernoulli equation .     and the dopant scale @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath69 limit approaches the linear relation without window functions .",
    ", width=283 ]    instead of bernoulli dynamics , the eos of the titanium dioxide memristor based on both linear and nonlinear ionic drift models conform to the abel differential equations , as demonstrated in the previous section .",

    "let us consider a memristive system with single state - variable .",
