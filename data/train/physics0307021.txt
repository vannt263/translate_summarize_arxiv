    "electromagnetic properties of periodic stratified media have been a subject of extensive research for decades ( see , for example , strat1,strat2,strat3 and references therein ) .",
    "of particular interest has been the case of periodic stacks ( @xmath0 photonic crystals ) made up of lossless dielectric components with different refractive indices .",
    "photonic crystals with one - dimensional periodicity had been widely used in optics long before the term  photonic crystals  was invented .",
    "let us look at the classical problem of a plane electromagnetic wave incident on the surface of semi - infinite plane - parallel periodic array , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sis1 ] .",
    "the well known effects of the slab periodicity are : ( i ) the possibility of omnidirectional reflectance when the incident radiation is reflected by the slab , regardless of the angle of incidence ; ( ii ) the possibility of negative refraction , when the tangential component of the energy flux @xmath1 of transmitted wave is antiparallel to that of the incident wave ; ( iii ) dramatic slowdown of the transmitted wave near photonic band edge frequency , where the normal component of the transmitted wave group velocity @xmath2 vanishes along with the respective energy flux @xmath1 .",
    "the extensive discussion on the subject and numerous references can be found in omni1,omni2,omni3 , negrefr1,negrefr2,joann1,scalora1,agua01,scalora2,scalora97 .",
    "all the above effects can occur even in the simplest case of a semi - infinite periodic array of two isotropic dielectric materials with different refractive indices , for example , glass and air .",
    "the majority of known photonic crystals fall into this category . the introduction of _ dielectric anisotropy _ , however , can bring qualitatively new features to electromagnetic properties of periodic stratified media and open up new opportunities for practical applications ( see , for example , a recent publication @xcite ) .",
    "one of such phenomena is the subject of this work .      consider a semi - infinite periodic stack with at least one of the constituents being an anisotropic dielectric material with oblique orientation of anisotropic axis .",
    "a simple example of such an array is presented in fig .",
    "[ stackab ] .    we will show that under certain physical conditions , a monochromatic plane wave incident on the semi - infinite slab is converted into an abnormal electromagnetic mode with huge amplitude and nearly tangential energy density flux , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sis2 ] .",
    "such a wave will be referred to as the _ axially frozen mode _ ( afm ) .",
    "the use of this term is justified because the normal ( axial ) component @xmath3 of the respective group velocity becomes vanishingly small , while the amplitude of the afm can exceed the amplitude of the incident plane wave by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the group velocity @xmath2 of the afm is parallel to the semi - infinite slab boundary and , therefore , the magnitude of the tangential component @xmath4 of the respective energy density flux @xmath5 is overwhelmingly larger than the magnitude of the normal component @xmath6 .",
    "but , although @xmath7 , the normal component @xmath6 of the energy density flux inside the slab is still comparable with that of the incident plane wave in vacuum .",
    "this property persists even if the normal component @xmath3 of the wave group velocity inside the slab vanishes , i.e.,@xmath8the qualitative explanation for this is that the infinitesimally small value of @xmath3 is offset by huge magnitude of the energy density @xmath9 in the afm . as the result ,",
    "the product @xmath10 , which determines the normal component @xmath11 of the energy flux , remains finite .",
    "the above behavior is totally different from what happens in the vicinity of a photonic band edge , where the normal component @xmath3 of the wave group velocity vanishes too .",
    "indeed , let us introduce the transmittance @xmath12 and the reflectance @xmath13 of a lossless semi - infinite slab@xmath14 in line with eq .",
    "( [ sz > 0 ] ) , in the afm  regime the transmittance @xmath15 remains significant and can be even close to unity , as shown in an example in fig .",
    "[ te](a ) . in other words ,",
    "the incident plane wave enters the slab with little reflectance , where it turns into an abnormal afm with infinitesimally small normal component of the group velocity , huge amplitude , and huge tangential component of the energy density flux .",
    "by contrast , in the vicinity of a photonic band edge ( at frequencies near @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ te](a ) ) , the transmittance of semi - infinite slab always vanishes , along with the normal component @xmath3 of the wave group velocity .",
    "it turns out that at a given frequency @xmath17 the afm regime can occur only for a special direction @xmath18 of the incident plane wave propagation@xmath19this special direction of incidence always makes an oblique angle with the normal @xmath20 to the layers . to find @xmath18 for a given @xmath17 or , conversely , to find @xmath17 for a given @xmath18 , one has to solve the maxwell equations in the periodic stratified medium",
    "this problem will be addressed in section 3 . in section 2",
    "we consider the relation between the afm regime and the singularity of the electromagnetic dispersion relation responsible for such a peculiar behavior . if the frequency @xmath21 and the direction of incidence @xmath22 do not match explicitly as prescribed by eq .",
    "( [ n0,w0 ] ) , the afm regime will be somewhat smeared .",
    "let @xmath23 be the transmitted electromagnetic field inside the semi - infinite slab ( the explicit definition of @xmath24 is given in eqs .",
    "( [ me4 ] ) and ( [ t = ex+ev ] ) ) .",
    "it turns out that in the vicinity of the afm regime , @xmath23 is a superposition of the extended and evanescent bloch eigenmodes@xmath25where @xmath26 is an extended mode with @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is an evanescent mode with @xmath29 . as shown in an example in fig .",
    "[ amz ] , both the contributions to @xmath30 have huge and nearly equal and opposite values near the slab boundary , so that their superposition ( [ psi tz ] ) at @xmath31 is small enough to satisfy the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) . as the distance @xmath32 from the slab boundary increases , the evanescent component @xmath33 decays exponentially , while the amplitude of the extended component @xmath26 remains constant and huge . as the result , the field amplitude @xmath34 reaches its huge saturation value @xmath35 at a certain distance from the slab boundary ( see eqs .",
    "( [ psi ev ] ) , ( psi(n ) ) and ( [ psit0 ] ) ) .",

    "conversely , when the frequency @xmath21 tends to its critical value @xmath17 for a given direction of incidence @xmath18 , the saturation value of the afm amplitude diverges as @xmath40 . in the real situation , of course",
    ", the afm amplitude will be limited by such physical factors as : ( i ) nonlinear effects , ( ii ) electromagnetic losses , ( iii ) structural imperfections of the periodic array , ( iv ) finiteness of the slab dimensions , ( v ) deviation of the incident radiation from a perfect plane monochromatic wave .",
    "[ beam ] gives a good qualitative picture of what really happens in the vicinity of the afm regime .",
    "consider a wide monochromatic beam of frequency @xmath21 incident on the surface of semi - infinite photonic slab .",

    "as frequency @xmath21 tends to @xmath17 from either direction , the normal component @xmath3 of the transmitted wave group velocity approaches zero , while the tangential component @xmath43 remains finite @xmath44this relation together with the equality@xmath45involving the refraction angle @xmath46 , yield@xmath47hence , in the vicinity of the afm regime , the transmitted ( refracted ) electromagnetic wave can be viewed as a _",
    "grazing mode_. the most important and unique feature of this grazing mode directly relates to the fact that the transmittance @xmath15 of the semi - infinite slab remains finite even at @xmath42 ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ te](a ) ) .",
    "indeed , let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be the cross - section areas of the incident and transmitted ( refracted ) beams , respectively .",
    "obliviously,@xmath50let us also introduce the quantities @xmath51where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the energy density fluxes of the incident and transmitted waves . @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the total power transmitted by the incident and transmitted ( refracted ) beams , respectively . the expressions ( [ theta 2 ] ) and ( [ theta 3 ] ) imply that@xmath56which is nothing more than a manifestation of the energy conservation law . finally , eq .

    "the expressions ( [ theta 1 ] ) and ( [ theta 5 ] ) show that in the vicinity of the afm regime , the transmitted wave behaves like a grazing mode with huge and nearly tangential energy density flux @xmath53 and very small ( compared to that of the incident beam ) cross - section area @xmath49 , so that the total power @xmath60 associated with the transmitted wave can not exceed the total power @xmath54 of the incident wave : @xmath61 .    the above qualitative consideration",
    "is only valid on the scales exceeding the size @xmath62 of the unit cell ( which is of the order of magnitude of @xmath63 ) and more importantly , exceeding the _ transitional distance _",
    "@xmath64 from the slab boundary where the evanescent mode contribution to the resulting electromagnetic field @xmath30 is still significant .",
    "the latter means that the width of both the incident and the refracted beams must be much larger than @xmath65 .",
    "if the above condition is not met , we can not treat the transmitted wave as a beam , and the expressions ( [ theta 1 ] ) through ( [ theta 5 ] ) do not apply . instead , we would have to use the explicit electrodynamic expressions for @xmath23 , such as the asymptotic formula ( [ psit0 ] ) .",
    "note that if the direction @xmath22 of the incident wave propagation and the frequency @xmath21 _ exactly match _ the condition ( [ n0,w0 ] ) for the afm regime , the transmitted wave @xmath23 does not reduce to a superposition ( [ psi tz ] ) of canonical bloch eigenmodes .",
    "instead , the afm is described by a general floquet eigenmode @xmath66 from eq .",
    "( [ psi 01 ] ) , which diverges inside the slab as @xmath20 , until the nonlinear effects or other limiting factors come into play .",
    "the related mathematical analysis is provided in sections 3 and 4 .    in some respects ,",
    "the remarkable behavior of the afm , is similar to that of the _ frozen mode _ related to the phenomenon of _ electromagnetic unidirectionality _ in nonreciprocal magnetic photonic crystals pre01,prb03 . in a unidirectional photonic crystal , electromagnetic radiation of a certain frequency @xmath17",
    "can propagate with finite group velocity @xmath67 only in one of the two opposite directions , say , from right to left .",
    "the problem with the electromagnetic unidirectionality , though , is that it essentially requires the presence of magnetic materials with strong circular birefringence ( faraday rotation ) and low losses at the frequency range of interest .",
    "such materials are readily available at the microwave frequencies , but at the infrared and optical frequency ranges , finding appropriate magnetic materials is highly problematic .",
    "thus , at frequencies above @xmath68 hz , the electromagnetic unidirectionality along with the respective nonreciprocal magnetic mechanism of the frozen mode formation may prove to be impractical .",
    "_ by contrast , the occurrence of afm does not require the presence of magnetic or any other essentially dispersive components in the periodic stack .",
    "therefore , the afm regime can be realized at any frequencies , including the infrared , optical , and even ultraviolet frequency ranges_. the only essential physical requirement is the presence of anisotropic dielectric layers with proper orientation of the anisotropy axes .",
    "an example of such an array is shown in fig .",
    "[ stackab ] .    in section 2 we establish the relation between the phenomenon of afm and the electromagnetic dispersion relation of the periodic layered medium .",
    "this allows us to formulate strict and simple symmetry conditions for such a phenomenon to occur , as well as to find out what kind of periodic stratified media can exhibit the effect .",
    "relevant theoretical analysis based on the maxwell equations in stratified media is carried out in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss some practical aspects of the phenomenon .",

    "although the explicit expression for @xmath348 is rather complicated and cumbersome , it has very simple and transparent structure .",
    "indeed , the tangential energy flux can be represented in the following form@xmath349where the tangential group velocity @xmath350 behaves regularly at @xmath351 .",
    "therefore , the magnitude and the space distribution of the tangential energy flux @xmath346 in and near the afm regime literally coincides with that of the electromagnetic energy density @xmath352 , which is proportional to @xmath353 . a typical picture of that is shown in fig .",
    "[ amz](a ) .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , a distinctive characteristic of the afm regime is that the incident monochromatic radiation turns into a very unusual grazing wave inside the slab , as shown schematically in figs .",
    "sis2 and [ beam ] . such a grazing wave is significantly different from that occurring in the vicinity of the total internal reflection regime , where the transmitted wave also propagates along the interface .",
    "the most obvious difference is that near the regime of total internal reflection , the reflectivity approaches unity , which implies that the intensity of the transmitted ( refracted ) wave vanishes .",
    "by contrast , in the case of afm the light reflection from the interface can be small , as shown in an example in fig .",
    "[ te](a ) .",
    "thus , in the afm case , a significant portion of the incident light gets converted into the grazing wave ( the afm ) with huge amplitude , compared to that of the incident wave .",
    "for this reason , the afm regime can be of great utility in many applications .",
    "another distinctive feature of the afm regime relates to the field distribution inside the periodic medium .",
    "the electromagnetic field of the afm can be approximated by a divergent floquet eigenmode @xmath354 from ( [ psi 01 ] ) , whose magnitude @xmath355 increases as @xmath356 , until nonlinear effects or other limiting factors come into play .",
    "in fact , the field amplitude inside the slab can exceed the amplitude of the incident plane wave by several orders of magnitude , depending on the quality of the periodic array , the actual number of the layers , and the width of the incident light beam .",
    "looking at the @xmath20 component of light group velocity and energy flux , we see a dramatic slowdown of light in the vicinity of the afm regime , with all possible practical applications extensively discussed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite , and references therein ) . in principle , there can be a situation when the tangential components @xmath357 of the group velocity also vanish in the afm regime , along with the axial component @xmath3 .",
    "although we did not try to achieve such a situation in our numerical experiments , it is not prohibited and might occur if the physical parameters of the periodic array are chosen properly .",
    "in such a case , the afm regime reduces to its particular case  the frozen mode regime with @xmath358 inside the periodic medium .",
    "this regime would be similar to that considered in prb03 , with one important difference : it is not related to the magnetic unidirectionality and , hence , there is no need to incorporate nonreciprocal magnetic layers in the periodic array .",
    "the latter circumstance allows to realize the frozen mode regime at the infrared , optical , and even uv frequency range .",
