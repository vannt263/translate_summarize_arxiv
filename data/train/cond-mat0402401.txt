    "high-@xmath0 superconductive cuprates ( htsc ) belong to the class of substances where the strong electron correlations are important .",
    "this circumstance and also the fact that these substances have non - trivial phase diagrams ( see e.g. review @xcite ) lead to the difficulties in description of htsc in framework of first principles ( _ ab initio _ ) methods , especially in the low doping region .",
    "so at present moment the most adequate method of htsc theoretical investigations is the model approach .",
    "effective models of htsc ( e.g. @xmath2 model ) usually contain free parameters that could be fitted to experimental data ( comparison of calculated and experimental fermi surfaces , dispersion curves , etc . )",
    "but as soon as one uses model approach the question concerning correctness of these parameters arises .",
    "one of the possible ways to answer this question is to obtain relations between parameters of some effective model and microscopic parameters of the underlying crystal structure .",
    "the underlying crystal structure of htsc could be described either by the 3-band emery model @xcite or by the multiband @xmath3 model @xcite .",
    "one can compare parameters bound to these models with parameters obtained by very different approach , e.g. with _ ab initio _ calculated parameters .",
    "it does not mean that the _ ab initio _ band structure is correct .",
    "due to the strong electron correlations it is for sure incorrect in the low doping region where these correlations are most significant . nevertheless , the single electron parameters are of interest and may be compared with the appropriate parameters obtained by fitting to the experimental arpes data .    in the present paper",
    "we obtain relations between microscopic parameters of the multiband @xmath3 model and parameters of the effective singlet - triplet @xmath2 model for hole doped htsc .",
    "then we compare these parameters and the @xmath2 model parameters obtained in the _ ab initio _ calculations . in section [ section : abinitio ] the details of _ ab initio _ calculation within density functional theory are presented . in section [ section : heff ]",
    "formulation of the effective singlet - triplet model as the low - energy hamiltonian for the multiband @xmath3 model with generalized tight - binding ( gtb ) method applied are described . in both methods",
    "the parent insulating compound @xmath4 is investigated .",
    "parameters are obtained at zero doping because within the gtb method the evolution of the band structure with doping is described only by changes in the occupation numbers of zero - hole , single - hole , and two - hole local terms , while all parameters are fitted in undoped case and therefore fixed for all doping levels .",
    "the resulting parameters of both approaches ( gtb and _ ab initio _ ) are in very good qualitative and quantitative agreement with each other and parameters extracted from experiment . also , these parameters are in reasonable agreement with @xmath2 model parameters used in the literature",
    "we conclude that the obtained set of model parameters should be used in effective models for proper quantitative description of htsc in the whole doping region .",
    "the band structure of @xmath4 was obtained in frames of the linear muffin - tin orbital method @xcite in tight - binding approach @xcite ( tb - lmto ) withing the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the crystal structure data @xcite corresponds to tetragonal @xmath4 .",
    "the effective hopping parameters @xmath5 were calculated by the least square fit procedure to the bands obtained in lda calculation @xcite .",
    "the effective exchange interaction parameters @xmath6 were calculated using the formula derived in @xcite , where the green function method was used to calculate @xmath6 as second derivative of the ground state energy with respect to the magnetic moment rotation angle via eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained in lda+@xmath7 calculation @xcite .",
    "the lda+@xmath7 approach allows to obtain the experimental antiferromagnetic insulating ground state for the undoped cuprate in contrast to the lda approach which gives a nonmagnetic metallic ground state @xcite .",
    "the coulomb parameters @xmath8  ev and @xmath9  ev used in lda+@xmath7 calculation were obtained in constrained lsda supercell calculations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 @xcite and hubbard @xcite models are widely used to investigate htsc compounds . while using these models one , in principle , can catch up qualitatively essential physics .",
    "the parameters in these models ( _ i.e. _ the hopping integral @xmath10 , antifferomagnetic exchange @xmath11 , hubbard repulsion @xmath7 ) are typically extracted from experimental data .",
    "thus , these parameters do not have a direct microscopical meaning .",
    "more consequent approach is to write down the multiband hamiltonian for the real crystal structure ( which now includes parameters of this _ real _ structure ) and map this hamiltonian onto some low - energy model ( like @xmath2 model ) . in this",
    "case parameters of real structure could be taken from the _ ab initio _ calculations or fitted to experimental data .",
    "as the starting model that properly describes crystal structure of the cuprates it is convenient to use 3-band emery @xmath3 model @xcite or the multiband @xmath3 model @xcite .",
    "the set of microscopic parameters for the first one was calculated in @xcite . while this model is simplier then the multiband @xmath3 model it lacks for some significant features , namely importance of @xmath12 orbitals on copper and @xmath13 orbitals on apical oxygen .",
    "non - zero occupancy of @xmath12 orbitals pointed out in xas and eels experiments which shows 2 - 10% occupancy of @xmath12 orbitals @xcite and 15% doping dependent occupancy of @xmath13 orbitals @xcite in all htsc of p - type ( hole doped ) . in order to take into account these facts",
    "the multi - band @xmath3 model should be used : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the annihilation operator in wannier representation of the hole at site @xmath16 ( copper or oxygen ) at orbital @xmath17 with spin @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",

    "gtb method @xcite consist of exact diagonalization of intracell part of @xmath3 hamiltonian ( [ eq : hpd ] ) and perturbative account for the intercell part . for @xmath44",
    "the unit cell is @xmath45 cluster , and a problem of nonorthogonality of the molecular orbitals of adjacent cells is solved by an explicit fashion namely by constructing the relevant wannier functions on a five - orbitals initial basis of the atomic states @xcite . in a new symmetric basis",
    "the intracell part of the total hamiltonian is diagonalized , allowing to classify all possible effective quasiparticle excitations in @xmath46-plane according to a symmetry .",
    "calculations @xcite of the quasiparticle dispersion and spectral intensities in the framework of multiband @xmath3 model with use of gtb method are in very good agreement with arpes data on insulating compound @xmath47 @xcite ( see fig .",

    "this pinning appears due to the in - gap state , spectral weight of this state is proportional to doping concentration @xmath49 and when fermi level comes to this in - gap band then fermi level `` stacks '' there . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the doping dependence of chemical potential shift @xmath50 for n - type high-@xmath0 @xmath51 ( ncco ) and p - type high-@xmath0 @xmath44 ( lsco ) is shown .",
    "the localized in - gap state exist in ncco also for the same reason as in lsco , but its energy is determined by the extremum of the band at @xmath52 point and it appears to be above the bottom of the conductivity band .",
    "thus , the first doped electron goes into the band state at the @xmath53 and the chemical potential for the very small concentration merges into the band . at higher @xmath49",
    "it meets the in - gap state with a pinning at @xmath54 and then @xmath55 again moves into the band .",

    "was obtained with the following set of the microscopic parameters : @xmath59    as the next step we will formulate the effective model . simplest way to do it is to completely neglect contribution of two - particle triplet state @xmath60",
    ". then there will be only one low - energy two - particle state - zhang - rice - type singlet @xmath61 - and the effective model will be the usual @xmath2 model .",
    "but in the multiband @xmath3 model the difference @xmath62 between energy of two - particle singlet and two - particle triplet depends strongly on various model parameters , particularly on distance of the apical oxygen from the planar oxygen , energy of the apical oxygen , difference between energy of @xmath12-orbitals and @xmath63-orbitals . for the realistic values of model parameters",

    "<S> the present paper covers the problem of parameters determination for high-@xmath0 superconductive copper oxides . </S>",
    "<S> different approaches , _ ab initio _ lda and lda+u calculations and generalized tight - binding ( gtb ) method for strongly correlated electron systems , are used to calculate hopping and exchange parameters of the effective singlet - triplet model for @xmath1-layer . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting parameters are in remarkably good agreement with each other and with parameters extracted from experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this set of parameters is proposed for proper quantitative description of physics of hole doped high-@xmath0 cuprates in the framework of effective models . </S>"
