    "the availability of ubiquitous communication through the internet is driving the migration of business transactions from direct contact between people to electronically mediated interactions .",
    "people interact electronically either through human - computer interfaces or through programs representing humans , so - called agents . in either case ,",
    "no physical interactions among entities occur , and the systems are much more susceptible to fraud and deception .    traditional methods to avoid cheating involve cryptographic schemes and _ trusted third parties _ ( ttp s ) that overlook every transaction .",
    "such systems are very costly , introduce potential bottlenecks , and may be difficult to deploy due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the environment : e.g. , agents in different geographical locations may be subject to different legislation , or different interaction protocols .",
    "reputation mechanisms offer a novel and effective way of ensuring the necessary level of trust which is essential to the functioning of any market .",
    "they are based on the observation that agent strategies change when we consider that interactions are repeated : the other party remembers past cheating , and changes its terms of business accordingly in the future . therefore , the expected gains due to future transactions in which the agent has a higher reputation can offset the loss incurred by not cheating in the present .",
    "this effect can be amplified considerably when such reputation information is shared among a large population , and thus multiplies the expected future gains made accessible by honest behavior .",
    "existing reputation mechanisms enjoy huge success .",
    "systems such as ebay or amazon implement reputation mechanisms which are partly credited for the businesses success .",
    "studies show that human users seriously take into account the reputation of the seller when placing bids in online auctions @xcite , and that despite the incentive to free ride , feedback is provided in more than half of the transactions on ebay @xcite .",
    "one important challenge associated with designing reputation mechanisms is to ensure that truthful feedback is obtained about the actual interactions , a property called _ incentive - compatibility_. rational users can regard the private information they have observed as a valuable asset , not to be freely shared .",
    "worse even , agents can have external incentives to misreport and thus manipulate the reputation information available to other agents @xcite . without proper measures ,",
    "the reputation mechanism will obtain unreliable information , biased by the strategic interests of the reporters .",
    "honest reporting incentives should be addressed differently depending on the predominant role of the reputation mechanisms .",
    "the _ signaling _ role is useful in environments where the service offered by different providers may have different quality , but all clients interacting with the same provider are treated equally ( markets with _ adverse selection _ ) .",
    "this is the case , for example , in a market of web - services .",
    "different providers possess different hardware resources and employ different algorithms ; this makes certain web - services better than others .",
    "nevertheless , all requests issued to the same web - service are treated by the same program .",
    "some clients might experience worse service than others , but these differences are random , and not determined by the provider .",
    "the feedback from previous clients statistically estimates the quality delivered by a provider in the future , and hence signals to future clients which provider should be selected .",
    "the _ sanctioning _ role , on the other hand , is present in settings where service requests issued by clients must be individually addressed by the provider",
    ". think of a barber , who must skillfully shave every client that walks in his shop .",
    "the problem here is that providers must exert care ( and costly effort ) for satisfying every service request",
    ". good quality can result only when enough effort was exerted , but the provider is better off by exerting less effort : e.g. , clients will anyway pay for the shave , so the barber is better off by doing a sloppy job as fast as possible in order to have time for more customers .",
    "this _ moral hazard _",
    "situation can be eliminated by a reputation mechanism that punishes providers for not exerting effort .",
    "low effort results in negative feedback that decreases the reputation , and hence the future business opportunities of the provider .",
    "the future loss due to a bad reputation offsets the momentary gain obtained by cheating , and makes cooperative behavior profitable .",
    "there are well known solutions for providing honest reporting incentives for signaling reputation mechanisms . since all clients interacting with a service receive the same quality ( in a statistical sense ) , a client s private observation influences her belief regarding the experience of other clients . in the web - services market",
    "mentioned before , the fact that one client had a bad experience with a certain web - service makes her more likely to believe that other clients will also encounter problems with that same web - service .",
    "this correlation between the client s private belief and the feedback reported by other clients can be used to design feedback payments that make honesty a nash equilibrium . when submitting feedback , clients get paid an amount that depends both on the the value they reported and on the reports submitted by other clients .",
    "as long as others report truthfully , the expected payment of every client is maximized by the honest report  thus the equilibrium . and show that incentive - compatible payments can be designed to offset both reporting costs and lying incentives .    for _ sanctioning _ reputation mechanisms the same payment schemes are not guaranteed to be incentive - compatible .",
    "different clients may experience different service quality because the provider decided to exert different effort levels .",
    "the private beliefs of the reporter may no longer be correlated to the feedback of other clients , and therefore , the statistical properties exploited by are no longer present .    as an alternative , we propose different incentives to motivate honest reporting based on the repeated presence of the client in the market .",
    "game theoretic results ( i.e. , the _ folk theorems _ ) show that repeated interactions support new equilibria where present deviations are made unattractive by future penalties . even without a reputation mechanism ,",
    "a client can guide her future play depending on the experience of previous interactions . as a first result of this paper ,",
    "we describe a mechanism that indeed supports a cooperative equilibrium where providers exert effort all the time .",
    "the reputation mechanism correctly records when the client received low quality .",
    "there are certainly some applications where clients repeatedly interact with the same seller with a potential moral hazard problem .",
    "the barber shop mentioned above is one example , as most people prefer going to the same barber ( or hairdresser ) .",
    "another example is a market of delivery services .",
    "every package must be scheduled for timely delivery , and this involves a cost for the provider .",
    "some of this cost may be saved by occasionally dropping a package , hence the moral hazard .",
    "moreover , business clients typically rely on the same carrier to dispatch their documents or merchandise .",
    "as their own business depends on the quality and timeliness of the delivery , they do have the incentive to form a lasting relationship and get good service .",
    "yet another example is that of a business person who repeatedly travels to an offshore client .",
    "the business person has a direct interest to repeatedly obtain good service from the hotel which is closest to the client s offices .",
    "we assume that the quality observed by the clients is also influenced by environmental factors outside the control of , however observable by , the provider . despite the barber s best effort",
    ", a sudden movement of the client can always generate an accidental cut that will make the client unhappy .",
    "likewise , the delivery company may occasionally lose or damage some packages due to transportation accidents .",
    "nevertheless , the delivery company ( like the barber ) eventually learns with certainty about any delays , damages or losses that entitle clients to complain about unsatisfactory service .",
    "the mechanism we propose is quite simple . before asking feedback from the client ,",
    "the mechanism gives the provider the opportunity to acknowledge failure , and reimburse the client .",
    "only when the provider claims good service does the reputation mechanism record the feedback of the client .",
    "contradictory reports ( the provider claims good service , but the client submits negative feedback ) may only appear when one of the parties is lying , and therefore , both the client and the provider are sanctioned : the provider suffers a loss as a consequence of the negative report , while the client is given a small fine .",
    "one equilibrium of the mechanism is when providers always do their best to deliver the promised quality , and truthfully acknowledge the failures caused by the environmental factors .",
    "their `` honest '' behavior is motivated by the threat that any mistake will drive the unsatisfied client away from the market .",
    "when future transactions generate sufficient revenue , the provider does not afford to risk losing a client , hence the equilibrium .",
    "unfortunately , this socially desired equilibrium is not unique .",
    "clients can occasionally accept bad service and keep returning to the same provider because they do nt have better alternatives .",
    "moreover , since complaining for bad service is sanctioned by the reputation mechanism , clients might be reluctant to report negative feedback .",
    "penalties for negative reports and the clients lack of choice drives the provider to occasionally cheat in order to increase his revenue .    as a second result",
    ", we characterize the set of pareto - optimal equilibria of our mechanism and prove that the amount of unreported cheating that can occur is limited by two factors .",
    "the first factor limits the amount of cheating in general , and is given by the quality of the alternatives available to the clients .",
    "better alternatives increase the expectations of the clients , therefore the provider must cheat less in order to keep his customers .",
    "the second factor limits the amount of unreported cheating , and represents the cost incurred by clients to establish a reputation for reporting the truth . by stubbornly exposing bad service when it happens , despite the fine imposed by the reputation mechanism , the client signals to the provider that she is committed to always report the truth .",
    "such signals will eventually change the strategy of the provider to full cooperation , who will avoid the punishment for negative feedback . having a reputation for reporting truthfully is of course , valuable to the client ; therefore , a rational client accepts to lie ( and give up the reputation ) only when the cost of building a reputation for reporting honestly is greater than the occasional loss created by tolerated cheating .",
    "this cost is given by the ease with which the provider switches to cooperative play , and by the magnitude of the fine imposed for negative feedback .",
    "concretely , this paper proceeds as follows . in section [ related_work ]",
    "we describe related work , followed by a more detailed description of our setting in section [ setting ] .",
    "section [ gtanalysis ] presents a game theoretic model of our mechanism and an analysis of reporting incentives and equilibria .",
    "here we establish the existence of the cooperative equilibrium , and derive un upper bound on the amount of cheating that can occur in any pareto - optimal equilibrium .",
    "in section [ buidingreputation ] we establish the cost of building a reputation for reporting honestly , and hence compute an upper bound on the percentage of false reports recorded by the reputation mechanism in any equilibrium .",
    "we continue in section [ evilbuyers ] by analyzing the impact of malicious buyers that explicitly try to destroy the reputation of the provider .",
    "we give some initial approximations on the worst case damage such buyers can cause to providers .",
    "further discussions , open issues and directions for future work are discussed in section [ future_work ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] concludes our work .",
    "the notion of _ reputation _ is often used in game theory to signal the commitment of a player towards a fixed strategy .",
    "this is what we mean by saying that _ clients establish a reputation for reporting the truth _ : they commit to always report the truth . building a reputation",
    "usually requires some incomplete information repeated game , and can significantly impact the set of equilibrium points of the game .",
    "this is commonly referred to as the _ reputation effect _ ,",
    "first characterized by the seminal papers of , and .",
    "the reputation effect can be extended to all games where a player ( @xmath0 ) could benefit from committing to a certain strategy @xmath1 that is not credible in a complete information game : e.g. , a monopolist seller would like to commit to fight all potential entrants in a chain - store game @xcite , however , this commitment is not credible due to the cost of fighting . in an incomplete information game where the commitment type has positive probability , @xmath0 s opponent ( @xmath2 ) can at some point become convinced that @xmath0 is playing as if she were the commitment type .",
    "at that point , @xmath2 will play a best response against @xmath1 , which gives @xmath0 the desired payoff .",
    "establishing a reputation for the commitment strategy requires time and cost .",
    "when the higher future payoffs offset the cost of building reputation , the reputation effect prescribes minimum payoffs any equilibrium strategy should give to player @xmath0 ( otherwise , @xmath0 can profitably deviate by playing as if she were a commitment type ) .    study the class of all repeated games in which a long - run player faces a sequence of single - shot opponents who can observe all previous games .",
    "if the long - run player is sufficiently patient and the single - shot players have a positive prior belief that the long - run player might be a commitment type , the authors derive a lower bound on the payoff received by the long - run player in any nash equilibrium of the repeated game .",
    "this result holds for both finitely and infinitely repeated games , and is robust against further perturbations of the information structure ( i.e. , it is independent of what other types have positive probability ) .    provides a generalization of the above result for the two long - run player case in a special class of games called of `` conflicting interests '' , when one of the players is sufficiently more patient than the opponent .",
    "a game is of conflicting interests when the commitment strategy of one player ( @xmath0 ) holds the opponent ( @xmath2 ) to his minimax payoff .",
    "the author derives an upper limit on the number of rounds @xmath2 will not play a best response to @xmath0 s commitment type , which in turn generates a lower bound on @xmath0 s equilibrium payoff . for a detailed treatment of the reputation effect , the reader is directed to the work of .    in computer science and information systems research ,",
    "_ reputation _ information defines some aggregate of feedback reports about past transactions .",
    "this is the semantics we are using when referring to the reputation of the provider .",
    "reputation information encompasses a unitary appreciation of the personal attributes of the provider , and influences the trusting decisions of clients . depending on the environment , reputation has two main roles : to _ signal _ the capabilities of the provider , and to _ sanction _ cheating behavior @xcite .",
    "_ signaling _ reputation mechanisms allow clients to learn which providers are the most capable of providing good service .",
    "such systems have been widely used in computational trust mechanisms . and describe systems where agents use their direct past experience to recognize trustworthy partners .",
    "the global efficiency of the market is clearly increased , however , the time needed to build the reputation information prohibits the use of this kind of mechanisms in a large scale online market .    a number of signaling reputation mechanisms also take into consideration indirect reputation information , i.e. , information reported by peers .",
    "and use social networks in order to obtain the reputation of an unknown agent .",
    "agents ask acquaintances several hops away about the trustworthiness of an unknown agent .",
    "recommendations are afterwards aggregated into a single measure of the agent s reputation .",
    "this class of mechanisms , however intuitive , does not provide any rational participation incentives for the agents .",
    "moreover , there is little protection against untruthful reporting , and no guarantee that the mechanism can not be manipulated by a malicious provider in order to obtain higher payoffs .",
    "truthful reporting incentives for signaling reputation mechanisms are described by .",
    "honest reports are explicitly rewarded by payments that take into account the value of the submitted report , and the value of a report submitted by another client ( called the _ reference reporter _ ) .",
    "the payment schemes are designed based on _ proper scoring rules _ , mathematical functions that make possible the revelation of private beliefs @xcite . the essence behind honest reporting incentives is the observation that the private information a client obtains from interacting with a provider changes her belief regarding the reports of other clients . this change in beliefs can be exploited to make honesty an ex - ante nash equilibrium strategy .",
    "extend the above result by taking a computational approach to designing incentive compatible payment schemes . instead of using closed form scoring rules",
    ", they compute the payments using an optimization problem that minimizes the total budget required to reward the reporters . by also using several reference reports and filtering mechanisms",
    ", they render the payment mechanisms cheaper and more practical .",
    "presents a comprehensive investigation of binary _ sanctioning _ reputation mechanisms . as in our setting , providers are equally capable of providing high quality , however , doing so requires costly effort .",
    "the role of the reputation mechanism is to encourage cooperative behavior by punishing cheating : negative feedback reduces future revenues either by excluding the provider from the market , or by decreasing the price the provider can charge in future transactions .",
    "dellarocas shows that simple information structures and decision rules can lead to efficient equilibria , given that clients report honestly .",
    "our paper builds upon such mechanisms by addressing reporting incentives .",
    "we will abstract away the details of the underlying reputation mechanism through an explicit penalty associated with a negative feedback . given that such high enough penalties exist ,",
    "any reputation mechanism ( i.e. , feedback aggregation and trusting decision rules ) can be plugged in our scheme .    in the same group of work that addresses reporting incentives",
    ", we mention the work of , and .",
    "@xcite consider exchanges of goods for money and prove that a market in which agents are trusted to the degree they deserve to be trusted is equally efficient as a market with complete trustworthiness . by scaling the amount of the traded product ,",
    "the authors prove that it is possible to make it rational for sellers to truthfully declare their trustworthiness .",
    "truthful declaration of one s trustworthiness eliminates the need of reputation mechanisms and significantly reduces the cost of trust management .",
    "however , the assumptions made about the trading environment ( i.e. the form of the cost function and the selling price which is supposed to be smaller than the marginal cost ) are not common in most electronic markets .    for e - bay - like auctions , the goodwill hunting mechanism @xcite provides a way to make sellers indifferent between lying or truthfully declaring the quality of the good offered for sale . momentary gains or losses obtained from misrepresenting the good s quality",
    "are later compensated by the mechanism which has the power to modify the announcement of the seller .",
    "describe an incentive - compatible reputation mechanism that is particularly suited for peer - to - peer applications .",
    "their mechanism is similar to ours , in the sense that both the provider and the client are punished for submitting conflicting reports .",
    "the authors experimentally show that a class of common lying strategies are successfully deterred by their scheme . unlike their results , our paper considers _ all _ possible equilibrium strategies and sets bounds on the amount of untruthful information recorded by the reputation mechanism .",
    "we assume an online market , where rational clients ( she ) repeatedly request the same service from one provider ( he ) .",
    "every client repeatedly interacts with the service provider , however , successive requests from the same client are always interleaved with enough requests generated by other clients .",
    "transactions are assumed sequential , the provider does not have capacity constraints , and accepts all requests .",
    "the price of service is @xmath3 monetary units , and the service can have either high ( @xmath4 ) or low ( @xmath5 ) quality .",
    "only high quality is valuable to the clients , and has utility @xmath6 .",
    "low quality has utility 0 , and can be precisely distinguished from high quality . before each round , the client can decide to request the service from the provider , or quit the market and resort to an outside provider that is completely trustworthy .",
    "the outside provider always delivers high quality service , but for a higher price @xmath7 .",
    "if the client decides to interact with the online provider , she issues a request to the provider , and pays for the service . the provider can now decide to exert low ( @xmath8 ) or high ( @xmath9 ) effort when treating the request .",
    "low effort has a normalized cost of 0 , but generates only low quality .",
    "high effort is expensive ( normalized cost equals @xmath10 ) and generates high quality with probability @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is fixed , and depends on the environmental factors outside the control of the provider .",
    "@xmath13 , so that it is individually rational for providers to exert effort .    after exerting effort",
    ", the provider can observe the quality of the resulting service .",
    "he can then decide to deliver the service as it is , or to acknowledge failure and roll back the transaction by fully reimbursing the client .",
    "we assume perfect delivery channels , such that the client perceives exactly the same quality as the provider .",
    "after delivery , the client inspects the quality of service , and can accuse low quality by submitting a negative report to the reputation mechanism .    the reputation mechanism ( rm )",
    "is unique in the market , and trusted by all participants .",
    "it can oversee monetary transactions ( i.e. , payments made between clients and the provider ) and can impose fines on all parties .",
    "however , the rm does not observe the effort level exerted by the provider , nor does it know the quality of the delivered service",
    ".    the rm asks feedback from the client only if she chose to transact with the provider in the current round ( i.e. , paid the price of service to the provider ) and the provider delivered the service ( i.e. , provider did not reimburse the client ) .",
    "when the client submits negative feedback , the rm punishes both the client and the provider : the client must pay a fine @xmath14 , and the provider accumulates a negative reputation report .      although simplistic , this model retains the main characteristics of several interesting applications .",
    "a delivery service for perishable goods ( goods that lose value past a certain deadline ) is one of them .",
    "pizza , for example , must be delivered within 30 minutes , otherwise it gets cold and loses its taste .",
    "hungry clients can order at home , or drive to a more expensive local restaurant , where they re sure to get a hot pizza .",
    "the price of a home delivered pizza is @xmath15 , while at the restaurant , the same pizza would cost @xmath16 . in both cases ,",
    "the utility of a warm meal is @xmath17 .",
    "the pizza delivery provider must exert costly effort to deliver orders within the deadline .",
    "a courier must be dispatched immediately ( high effort ) , for an estimated cost of @xmath18 .",
    "while such action usually results in good service ( the probability of a timely delivery is @xmath19 ) , traffic conditions and unexpected accidents ( e.g. , the address is not easily found ) may still delay some deliveries past the deadline .",
    "once at the destination , the delivery person , as well as the client , know if the delivery was late or not . as it is common practice , the provider can acknowledge being late , and reimburse the client .",
    "clients may provide feedback to a reputation mechanism , but their feedback counts only if they were not reimbursed .",
    "the client s fine for submitting a negative report can be set for example at @xmath20 .",
    "the future loss to the provider caused by the negative report ( and quantified through @xmath21 ) depends on the reputation mechanism .",
    "a simplified market of car garagists or plumbers could fit the same model .",
    "the provider is commissioned to repair a car ( respectively the plumbing ) and the quality of the work depends on the exerted effort .",
    "high effort is more costly but ensures a lasting result with high probability .",
    "low effort is cheap , but the resulting fix is only temporary . in both cases , however , the warranty convention may specify the right of the client to ask for a reimbursement if problems reoccur within the warranty period",
    ". reputation feedback may be submitted at the end of the warranty period , and is accepted only if reimbursements did nt occur .",
    "an interesting emerging application comes with a new generation of web services that can optimally decide how to treat every request . for some service types ,",
    "a high quality response requires the exclusive use of costly resources .",
    "for example , computation jobs require cpu time , storage requests need disk space , information requests need queries to databases .",
    "sufficient resources , is a prerequisite , but not a guarantee for good service .",
    "software and hardware failures may occur , however , these failures are properly signaled to the provider .",
    "once monetary incentives become sufficiently important in such markets , intelligent providers will identify the moral hazard problem , and may act strategically as identified in our model .",
    "from game theoretic point of view , one interaction between the client and the provider can be modeled by the extensive - form game ( @xmath22 ) with imperfect public information , shown in figure [ fig : game ] .",
    "the client moves first and decides ( at node 1 ) whether to play @xmath23 and interact with the provider , or to play @xmath24 and resort to the trusted outside option .",
    "once the client plays @xmath23 , the provider can chose at node 2 whether to exert high or low effort ( i.e. , plays @xmath9 or @xmath8 respectively ) .",
    "when the provider plays @xmath8 the generated quality is low .",
    "when the provider plays @xmath9 , nature chooses between high quality ( @xmath4 ) with probability @xmath12 , and low quality ( @xmath5 ) with probability @xmath25 .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is assumed common knowledge in the market .",
    "having seen the resulting quality , the provider delivers ( i.e. , plays @xmath26 ) the service , or acknowledges low quality and rolls back the transaction ( i.e. , plays @xmath27 ) by fully reimbursing the client . if the service is delivered , the client can report positive ( @xmath28 ) or negative ( @xmath29 ) feedback .",
    "a pure strategy is a deterministic mapping describing an action for each of the player s information sets .",
    "the client has three information sets in the game @xmath22 .",
    "the first information set is singleton and contains the node 1 at the beginning of game when the client must decide between playing @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the second information set contains the nodes 7 and 8 ( the dotted oval in figure @xmath30 ) where the client must decide between reporting @xmath29 or @xmath28 , given that she has received low quality , @xmath5 .",
    "the third information set is singleton and contains the node 9 where the client must decide between reporting @xmath29 or @xmath28 , given that she received high quality , @xmath4 .",
    "the strategy @xmath31 , for example , is the honest reporting strategy , specifying that the client enters the game , reports @xmath29 when she receives low quality , and reports @xmath28 when she receives high quality .",
    "the set of pure strategies of the client is : @xmath32    similarly , the set of pure strategies of the provider is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , for example , is the socially desired strategy : the provider exerts effort at node 2 , acknowledges low quality at node 5 , and delivers high quality at node 6 .",
    "a pure strategy profile @xmath35 is a pair @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 denotes the set of probability distributions over the elements of @xmath0 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are mixed strategies for the client , respectively the provider , and @xmath42 is a mixed strategy profile .",
    "the payoffs to the players depend on the chosen strategy profile , and on the move of nature .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the pair of expected payoffs received by the client , respectively by the provider when playing strategy profile @xmath1 .",
    "the function @xmath44 is characterized in table [ tab : normalform ] and also describs the normal form transformation of @xmath22 . besides the corresponding payments made between the client and the provider , table [ tab : normalform ] also reflects the influence of the reputation mechanism , as further explained in section [ reputation_mech ] .",
    "the four strategies of the client that involve playing @xmath24 at node 1 generate the same outcomes , and therefore , have been collapsed for simplicity into a single row of table [ tab : normalform ] .",
    "cc    provider    &    .normal transformation of the extensive form game , @xmath22 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      for every interaction , the reputation mechanism records one of the three different signals it may receive : _ positive _ feedback when the client reports @xmath28 , _ negative _ feedback when the client reports @xmath29 , and _",
    "neutral _ feedback when the provider rolls back the transaction and reimburses the client . in figure",
    "[ fig : game ] ( and table [ tab : normalform ] ) positive and neutral feedback do not influence the payoff of the provider , while negative feedback imposes a punishment equivalent to @xmath21 .",
    "two considerations made us choose this representation .",
    "first , we associate neutral and positive feedback with the same reward ( 0 in this case ) because intuitively , the acknowledgement of failure may also be regarded as `` honest '' behavior on behalf of the provider .",
    "failures occur despite best effort , and by acknowledging them , the provider should nt suffer .",
    "however , neutral feedback may also result because the provider did not exert effort .",
    "the lack of punishment for these instances contradicts the goal of the reputation mechanism to encourage exertion of effort .",
    "fortunately , the action @xmath45 can be the result of rational behavior only in two circumstances , both excusable : one , when the provider defends himself against a malicious client that is expected to falsely report negative feedback ( details in section [ evilbuyers ] ) , and two , when the environmental noise is too big ( @xmath12 is too small ) to justify exertion of effort .",
    "neutral feedback can be used to estimate the parameter @xmath12 , or to detect coalitions of malicious clients , and indirectly , may influence the revenue of the provider . however , for the simplified model presented above , positive and neutral feedback are considered the same in terms of generated payoffs .",
    "the second argument relates to the role of the rm to constrain the revenue of the provider depending on the feedback of the client .",
    "there are several ways of doing that",
    ". describes two principles , and two mechanisms that punish the provider when the clients submit negative reports .",
    "the first , works by exclusion . after each negative report",
    "the reputation mechanism bans the provider from the market with probability @xmath46 .",
    "this probability can be tuned such that the provider has the incentive to cooperate almost all the time , and the market stays efficient .",
    "the second works by changing the conditions of future trade .",
    "every negative report triggers the decrease of the price the next @xmath47 clients will pay for the service . for lower values of @xmath47",
    "the price decrease is higher , nonetheless , @xmath47 can take any value in an efficient market .",
    "both mechanisms work because the future losses offset the momentary gain the provider would have had by intentionally cheating on the client .",
    "note that these penalties are given endogenously by lost future opportunities , and require some minimum premiums for trusted providers .",
    "when margins are not high enough , providers do not care enough about future transactions , and will use the present opportunity of cheating .",
    "another option is to use exogenous penalties for cheating .",
    "for example , the provider may be required to buy a licence for operating in the market .",
    "the licence is _ partially destroyed _ by every negative feedback .",
    "totaly destroyed licences must be restored through a new payment , and remaining parts can be sold if the provider quits the market . the price of the licence and the amount that is destroyed by a negative feedback can be scaled such that rational providers have the incentive to cooperate . unlike the previous solutions , this mechanism does not require minimum transaction margins as punishments for negative feedback are directly subtracted from the upfront deposit .    one way or another , all reputation mechanisms foster cooperation because the provider associates value to client feedback .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be the value of a positive , respectively a negative report . in the game in figure",
    "[ fig : game ] , @xmath48 is normalized to 0 , and @xmath49 is @xmath21 . by using this notation , we abstract away the details of the reputation mechanism , and retain only the essential punishment associated with negative feedback .",
    "any reputation mechanism can be plugged in our scheme , as long as the particular constraints ( e.g. , minimum margins for transactions ) are satisfied .",

    "the values of the discount factors can also be interpreted in terms of the minimum number of rounds the client ( and the provider ) will likely play the game .",
    "for example , the discount factor can be viewed as the probability that the client ( respectively the provider ) will `` live '' for another interaction in the market .",
    "it follows that the average lifetime of the provider is at least @xmath112 interactions ( with all clients ) , while the average lifetime of the client is at least @xmath113 interactions ( with the same pizza delivery service ) .",

    "the continuation payoffs enforcing a pareto - optimal ppe payoff profile are also pareto - optimal .",
    "therefore , clients falsely report positive feedback even under the more restrictive notion of negotiation - proof equilibrium . ]    however , a client who could commit to report honestly , ( i.e. , commit to play the strategy @xmath118 ) would benefit from cooperative trade .",

    "can then `` fake '' the committed client , and `` build a reputation '' for reporting honestly . when the reputation becomes credible",
    ", the provider will play @xmath34 ( the best response against @xmath121 ) , which is better for the client than the payoff she would obtain if the provider knew she was the `` rational '' type .    as an effect of reputation building",
    ", the set of equilibrium points is reduced to a set where the payoff to the client is higher than the payoff obtained by a client committed to report honestly .",
    "as anticipated from proposition [ prop : boundnorep ] , a smaller set of equilibrium points also reduces the bound of false reports recorded by the reputation mechanism . in certain cases , this bound can be reduced to almost zero .",
    "formally , incomplete information can be modeled by a perturbation of the complete information repeated game @xmath122 such that in period 0 ( before the first round of the game is played ) the `` type '' of the client is drawn by nature out of a countable set @xmath123 according to the probability measure @xmath124 .",
    "the client s payoff now additionally depends on her type .",
    "we say that in the perturbed game @xmath125 the provider has incomplete information because he is not sure about the true type of the client .",
    "two types from @xmath123 have particular importance :    * the `` normal '' type of the client , denoted by @xmath126 , is the rational client who has the payoffs presented in figure [ fig : game ] . * the `` commitment '' type of the client , denoted by @xmath127 , always prefers to play the commitment strategy @xmath121 . from a rational perspective , the commitment type client obtains an arbitrarily high supplementary reward for reporting the truth .",
    "this external reward makes the strategy @xmath121 the dominant strategy , and therefore , no commitment type client will play anything else than @xmath121 .    in theorem [",
    "th : equilibrium ] we give an upper bound @xmath128 on the number of times the provider delivers low quality in @xmath125 , given that he always observes the client reporting honestly .",
    "the intuition behind this result is the following .",
    "the provider s best response to a honest reporter is @xmath34 : always exert high effort , and deliver only when the quality is high .",
    "this gives the commitment type client her maximum attainable payoff in @xmath125 , corresponding to the socially efficient outcome . the provider , however , would be better off by playing against the normal type client , against whom he can obtain an expected payoff greater than @xmath97 .    the normal type client may be distinguished from a commitment type client only in the rounds when the provider delivers low quality : the commitment type always reports negative feedback , while the normal type might decide to report positive feedback in order to avoid the penalty @xmath14 .",
    "the provider can therefore decide to deliver low quality to the client in order to test her real type .",
    "the question is , how many times should the provider test the true type of the client .    every failed test ( i.e. , the provider delivers low quality and the client reports negative feedback ) generates a loss of @xmath129 to the provider , and slightly enforces the belief that the client reports honestly .",
    "since the provider can not wait infinitely for future payoffs , there must be a time when the provider will stop testing the type of the provider , and accepts to play the socially efficient strategy , @xmath34 .",
    "the switch to the socially efficient strategy is not triggered by a revelation of the client s type .",
    "the provider believes that the client _ behaves _ as if she were a commitment type , not that the client _ is _ a commitment type .",
    "the client may very well be a normal type who chooses to mimic the commitment type , in the hope that she will obtain better service from the provider .",
    "however , further trying to determine the true type of the client is too costly for the provider . therefore , the provider chooses to play @xmath120 , which is the best response to the commitment strategy @xmath121 .",
    "if the provider has incomplete information in @xmath122 , and assigns positive probability to the normal and commitment type of the client ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) , there is a finite upper bound , @xmath128 , on the number of times the provider delivers low quality in any equilibrium of @xmath125 .",
    "this upper bound is :    @xmath132    [ th : equilibrium ]    first , we use an important result obtained by about statistical inference ( lemma 1 ) : if every previously delivered low quality service was sanctioned by a negative report , the provider must expect with increasing probability that his next low quality delivery will also be sanctioned by negative feedback .",
    "technically , for any @xmath133 , the provider can deliver at most @xmath134 low quality services ( sanctioned by negative feedback ) before expecting that the @xmath135 low quality delivery will also be sanctioned by negative feedback with probability greater then @xmath46 .",
    "this number equals to :    @xmath136    as stated earlier , this lemma does not prove that the provider will become convinced that he is facing a commitment type client .",
    "it simply proves that after a finite number of rounds the provider becomes convinced that the client is playing as if she were a commitment type .",
    "second , if @xmath137 but is strictly smaller than @xmath28 , the rational provider does not deliver low quality ( it is easy to verify that the maximum discounted future gain does not compensate for the risk of getting a negative feedback in the present round ) . by the previously mentioned lemma , it must be that in any equilibrium , the provider delivers low quality a finite number of times .",
    "third , let us analyze the round , @xmath138 , when the provider is about to deliver a low quality service ( play @xmath139 ) for the last time .",
    "if @xmath46 is the belief of the provider that the client reports honestly in round @xmath138 , his expected payoff ( just before deciding to deliver the low quality service ) can be computed as follows :    * with probability @xmath46 the client reports 0 .",
    "her reputation for reporting honestly becomes credible , so the provider plays @xmath34 in all subsequent rounds .",
    "the provider gains @xmath140 in the current round , and expects @xmath141 for the subsequent rounds ; * with probability @xmath142 , the client reports @xmath28 and deviates from the commitment strategy , the provider knows he is facing a rational client , and can choose a continuation ppe strategy from the complete information game .",

    "providers cheat less if they a priory expect with higher probability to encounter honest reporting clients .",
    "a client that has once built a reputation for truthfully reporting the provider s behavior will benefit from cooperative trade during her entire lifetime , without having to convince each provider separately .",
    "therefore the upper bound on the loss a client has to withstand in order to convince a provider that she is a commitment type , becomes an upper bound on the total loss a client has to withstand during her entire lifetime in the market .",
    "how to effectively share the reputation of clients within the market remains an open issue .",
    "correlated with this idea is the observation that clients that use our mechanism are motivated to keep their identity . in generalized markets where",
    "agents are encouraged to play both roles ( e.g. a peer-2-peer file sharing market where the fact that an agent acts only as `` provider '' can be interpreted as a strong indication of `` double identity '' with the intention of cheating ) our mechanism also solves the problem signaled by related to cheap online pseudonyms .",
    "the price to pay for the new identity is the loss due to building a reputation as truthful reporter when acting as a client .    unlike incentive - compatible mechanism that pay reporters depending on the feedback provided by peers ,",
    "the mechanism described here is less vulnerable to collusion .",
    "the only reason individual clients would collude is to badmouth ( i.e. , artificially decrease the reputation of ) a provider",
    ". however , as long as the punishment for negative feedback is not super - linear in the number of reports ( this is usually the case ) , coordinating within a coalition brings no benefits for the colluders : individual actions are just as effective as the actions when part of a coalition . the collusion between the provider and client",
    "can only accelerate the synchronization of strategies on one of the ppe profiles ( collusion on a non - ppe strategy profile is not stable ) , which is rather desirable .",
    "the only profitable collusion can happen when competitor providers incentivize normal clients to unfairly downrate their current provider .",
    "colluding clients become _ malicious _ in this case , and the limits on the harm they can do are presented in section [ evilbuyers ] .",
    "the mechanism we describe here is not a general solution for all online markets . in general retail e - commerce",
    ", clients do nt usually interact with the same service provider more than once . as we have showed along this paper ,",
    "the assumption of a repeated interaction is crucial for our results .",
    "nevertheless , we believe there are several scenarios of practical importance that do meet our requirements ( e.g. , interactions that are part of a supply chain ) . for these , our mechanism can be used in conjunction with other reputation mechanisms to guarantee reliable feedback and improve the overall efficiency of the market .",
    "our mechanism can be further criticized for being centralized .",
    "the reputation mechanism acts as a central authority by supervising monetary transactions , collecting feedback and imposing penalties on the participants .",
    "however , we see no problem in implementing the reputation mechanism as a distributed system .",
    "different providers can use different reputation mechanisms , or , can even switch mechanisms given that some safeguarding measures are in place .",
    "concrete implementations remain to be addressed by future work .",
    "although we present a setting where the service always costs the same amount , our results can be easily extended to scenarios where the provider may deliver different kinds of services , having different prices .",
    "as long as the provider believes that requests are randomly drawn from some distribution , the bounds presented above can be computed using the average values of @xmath186 , @xmath3 and @xmath187 .",
    "the constraint on the provider s belief is necessary in order to exclude some unlikely situations where the provider cheats on a one time high value transaction , knowing that the following interactions carry little revenue , and therefore , can not impose effective punishments .    in this paper , we systematically overestimate the bounds on the worst case percentage of false reports recorded by the mechanism .",
    "the computation of tight bounds requires a precise quantitative description of the actual set of ppe payoffs the client and the provider can have in @xmath80 . and",
    "pose the theoretical grounds for computing the set of ppe payoffs in an infinitely repeated game with discount factors strictly smaller than 1",
    ". however , efficient algorithms that allow us to find this set are still an open question .",
    "as research in this domain progresses , we expect to be able to significantly lower the upper bounds described in sections [ gtanalysis ] and [ buidingreputation ] .",
    "one direction of future research is to study the behavior of the above mechanism when there is two - sided incomplete information : i.e. the client is also uncertain about the type of the provider .",
    "a provider type of particular importance is the `` greedy '' type who always likes to keep the client to a continuation payoff arbitrarily close to the minimal one . in this situation",
    "we expect to be able to find an upper bound @xmath188 on the number of rounds in which a rational client would be willing to test the true type of the provider .",
    "the condition @xmath189 describes the constraints on the parameters of the system for which the reputation effect will work in the favor of the client : i.e. the provider will give up first the `` psychological '' war and revert to a cooperative equilibrium .",
    "the problem of involuntary reporting mistakes briefly mentioned in section [ evilbuyers ] needs further addressing . besides false negative mistakes ( reporting @xmath29 instead of @xmath28 )",
    ", normal clients can also make false positive mistakes ( report @xmath28 instead of the intended @xmath29 ) . in our present framework ,",
    "one such mistake is enough ro ruin the reputation of a normal type client to report honestly .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we chose a sequential model where the feedback of the client is not required if the provider acknowledges low quality .",
    "once the reputation of the client becomes credible , the provider always rolls back the transactions that generate ( accidentally or not ) low quality , so the client is not required to continuously defend her reputation .",
    "nevertheless , the consequences of reporting mistakes in the reputation building phase must be considered in more detail .",
    "similarly , mistakes made by the provider , monitoring and communication errors will also influence the results presented here .",
    "last , but not the least , practical implementations of the mechanism we propose must address the problem of persistent online identities .",
    "one possible attack created by easy identity changes has been mentioned in section [ evilbuyers ] : malicious buyers can continuously change identity in order to discredit the provider . in another attack ,",
    "the provider can use fake identities to increase his revenue .",
    "when punishments for negative feedback are generated endogenously by decreased prices in a fixed number of future transactions , the provider can adopt the following strategy : he cheats on all real customers , but generates a sufficient number of fake transactions in between two real transactions , such that the effect created by the real negative report disappears . an easy fix to this latter attack",
    "is to charge transaction or entrance fees .",
    "however , these measures also affect the overall efficiency of the market , and therefore , different applications will most likely need individual solutions .",
    "effective reputation mechanisms must provide appropriate incentives in order to obtain honest feedback from self - interested clients . for environments characterized by adverse selection , direct payments can explicitly reward honest information by conditioning the amount to be paid on the information reported by other peers . the same technique unfortunately does not work when service providers have moral hazard , and can individually decide which requests to satisfy . sanctioning reputation mechanisms",
    "must therefore use other mechanisms to obtain reliable feedback .",
    "in this paper we describe an incentive - compatible reputation mechanism when the clients also have a repeated presence in the market . before asking feedback from the clients",
    ", we allow the provider to acknowledge failures and reimburse the price paid for service . when future transactions generate sufficient profit ,",
    "we prove that there is an equilibrium where the provider behaves as socially desired : he always exerts effort , and reimburses clients that occasionally receive bad service due to uncontrollable factors .",
    "moreover , we analyze the set of pareto - optimal equilibria of the mechanism , and establish a limit on the maximum amount of false information recorded by the mechanism .",
    "the bound depends both on the external alternatives available to clients and on the ease with which they can commit to reporting the truth .",
