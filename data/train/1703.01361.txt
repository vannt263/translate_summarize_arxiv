    "while lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of the standard model of particle physics , violations of this symmetry are allowed in a variety of models  @xcite at or around the planck scale , @xmath1gev . at energies relevant to modern experiments , then",
    ", lorentz invariance violating ( lv ) processes are expected to be suppressed at least by @xmath2 .",
    "an experimental observation of such phenomena would provide direct access to physics at the planck scale and a variety of precision tests have been performed to overcome this suppression ( c.f .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "neutrino oscillations can be used as a natural interferometer to probe even weak departures from this symmetry and have been studied with accelerator neutrinos  @xcite , reactor neutrinos  @xcite , and atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "lorentz and charge - parity - time ( cpt ) symmetry violation can be described generically within the context of the standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite , an observer - independent effective field theory that incorporates all possible spontaneous lv operators with the standard model lagrangian . in general",
    "the sme allows two classes of effects for neutrino oscillations , sidereal violations , in which the presence of a preferred spatial direction induces oscillation effects that vary with the neutrino travel direction , and spectral anomalies , in which , for instance , the oscillation amplitude has no dependence on or is proportional to the energy of the neutrino  @xcite . for a terrestrial fixed - baseline experiment ,",
    "the rotation of the earth induces a change in the direction of the neutrino target - detector vector relative to a fixed coordinate system such that a lv signal of the former type would manifest itself as a variation in the neutrino oscillation probability with sidereal time .",
    "this paper reports on a search for evidence of sidereal - dependent @xmath3 disappearance over an average baseline of 233.6  m using the t2k experiment . after introducing lorentz invariance violating oscillations within the sme and describing the t2k experiment ,",
    "the selection of an analysis sample composed predominately of muon neutrinos inside the ingrid  @xcite detector is presented .",
    "results of two complementary analyses of the data and concluding remarks follow thereafter .",
    "in this analysis , the lv is probed through @xmath4 disappearance channel . in the sme framework ,",
    "the disappearance probability of a @xmath4 over short baselines is given by  @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance travelled before detection .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : shortprob ] ) is valid as long as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the typical distance of standard @xmath9 oscillations  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath10 is the local sidereal time and @xmath11 is the earth s sidereal frequency . under a three flavour neutrino hypothesis",
    ", oscillations of @xmath4 to @xmath12 and @xmath13 can occur .",
    "in general , the ten coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are functions of the neutrino energy @xmath20 , the neutrino beam direction at the time origin ( see below ) , and of forty parameters within the sme which carry explicit lorentz and cpt violation information : @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath19 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are constant coefficients associated with cpt odd ( even ) vector ( tensor ) fields .",
    "it should be noted that the set of ten coefficients depend on the absolute direction of the neutrino baseline  @xcite . in the analysis to follow , a search for a sidereal variations is performed relative to an inertial frame centered on the sun assuming it to be stationary during the data taking period .",
    "other than the choice of the origin of the time coordinate , this frame is the same as in  @xcite . the time origin @xmath23 is chosen as 1 january 1970 , 09:00:00 coordinated universal time .",
    "data will be studied using the local sidereal phase ( lsp ) , which is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "the t2k long - baseline neutrino experiment uses the collision of 30  gev protons from the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) with a graphite target , and focuses charged mesons produced in the subsequent interactions along the primary proton beam direction using a series of magnetic horns .",
    "downstream of the production target is a 96  m long decay volume in which these mesons decay to produce a beam of primarily muon neutrinos ( @xmath25 @xmath26 along the beam axis ) .",
    "the present study is based on data accumulated from 2010 to 2013 , divided into four run periods , and corresponds to @xmath27 protons on target ( pot ) exposure of the ingrid detector . during this time period ,",
    "the horn current was chosen to focus positively charged pions and thereby enhance the neutrino , as opposed to antineutrino , composition of the beam .",
    "the neutrino beamline is located at the coast of the pacific ocean .",
    "the impact of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 on equation  ( [ eq : shortprob ] ) depends on the variation of the direction of the neutrino beam in the sun - centered frame .",
    "equivalently , the neutrino beam is defined by the beam colatitude @xmath30 in the earth - centered frame with the same fixed axis than the sun - centered frame . at the beamline location ,",
    "a local frame is defined where the z - axis corresponds to the zenith . the beam direction in this local frame",
    "is defined by the zenith angle @xmath31 and at the azimuthal angle @xmath32 .",
    "a more detailed description of the t2k experiment , its beamline , and detectors can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the ingrid detector is located @xmath33  m downstream of the graphite target and is composed of 14 @xmath34  @xmath35  @xmath36 cm modules assembled in a cross - shaped structure .",
    "each module holds 11 tracking segments built from pairs of orthogonally oriented scintillator planes interleaved with nine iron planes .",
    "it also holds three veto planes located on the top , bottom and one side of the module .",
    "the most upstream tracking plane is used as a front veto plane .",
    "the scintillator planes are built from 24 plastic scintillator bars connected to multi - pixel photon counters ( mppcs ) to detect scintillation light .",
    "ingrid monitors the neutrino beam direction , profile and intensity , selecting @xmath3 and @xmath37 interactions in its modules .",
    "situated on the beam center , its high event rate makes it well suited to a search for a sidereal variation in these interactions .",
    "although the @xmath38 oscillation probability in equation  ( [ eq : shortprob ] ) depends on the square of the neutrino flight length , the precise distance from creation to detection for each neutrino is unknown .",
    "indeed , the neutrino s parent meson may decay anywhere along the 96  m long decay volume which leads to a variety of path lengths to the detector as shown in figure  [ fig : nuz ] . as a result the present analysis uses the mean of this distribution , @xmath39  m , as an effective distance travelled for all candidate events .",
    "similarly , the mean neutrino energy of the flux at the ingrid detector , @xmath40 , is used .",
    "flight length to the ingrid detector for mc @xmath3 produced in the t2k decay volume .",
    "the distribution is separated based on the neutrino s parent particle . ]",
    "to prevent lv oscillation - induced @xmath41 and @xmath42 from washing out an lv effect on the @xmath3 data , it is essential to select a sample with very high @xmath3 purity .",
    "since the @xmath42 cc interactions have a 3.5  gev production threshold , their cross section in the t2k energy range is very small .",
    "their impact on the analysis was evaluated to be negligible even if they are produced as a lv signal .",
    "consequently , no attempts were made to further reject them in the signal selection .",
    "+ charged - current neutrino @xmath3 interactions within ingrid are identified by a reconstructed track consistent with a muon originating in the detector fiducial volume , and coincident in time with the expected arrival of neutrinos in the beam originated from a given proton bunch .",
    "in addition to a set of cuts to define a basic lepton - like sample  @xcite , a likelihood function , hereafter referred to as muon confidence level or @xmath43 , is used to further separate tracks produced by muons from showers produced by electrons or hadrons .",
    "this function is based on four discriminating variables : the number of active scintillator bars transverse to the beam direction averaged over the number of active planes , _",
    "i.e. _ planes having at least one hit belonging to the track ; the primary track s length ; the dispersion of the track s energy deposition with distance ; and the number of active scintillator bars close to the primary interaction vertex .",
    "the first three variables focus on the tendency for showers to have a broader transverse development and varying rate of energy deposition , whereas muons at t2k energies are minimum ionizing and are more longitudinally penetrating .",
    "the fourth variable is based on a region defined by only the two planes upstream and downstream of the event vertex and is useful for discriminating against showers with additional particles near the event vertex and proton - induced activity .",
    "since the total neutrino flux is constant and the neutral current ( nc ) cross section is the same for each neutrino flavor , the nc event rate within ingrid is expected to be constant with sidereal time .",
    "accordingly , no additional cuts to remove nc events are used .",
    "figure  [ likelihood ] shows the @xmath43 likelihood distribution for reconstructed data and monte carlo ( mc ) @xmath3 cc , @xmath41 cc and nc interactions .",
    "variable for @xmath3 cc ( blue ) , @xmath41 cc ( red ) , and nc events ( green ) from the mc are overlaid with data ( black ) .",
    "the data , @xmath3 cc and @xmath3 nc histograms are first normalized by protons on target .",
    "then , these three histograms are scaled by one over the number of @xmath3 cc events in order to preserve their relative proportions .",
    "the @xmath41 cc histogram is area normalized to compare with the @xmath3 cc histogram .",
    "the pink arrow represents the lower cut value on the @xmath43 that defines the @xmath4 event selection . ]",
    "a cut on @xmath44 has been selected to ensure that the @xmath41 contamination of the final sample is smaller than the statistical error on the @xmath3 component while maximizing the @xmath4 statistics . after applying all analysis cuts the @xmath3 cc selection efficiency is @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath41 efficiency , @xmath46 , has been reduced to 13.3% by using @xmath43 .",
    "there are @xmath47 events remaining in the final sample , which provides an average statistical error of @xmath48 in each of the 32 analysis bins ( defined below ) .",
    "if an oscillation effect equivalent to three times the statistical error on the @xmath3 component appears as @xmath41 in the final sample the resulting contamination will be @xmath49 . assuming no oscillation due to lv effect , the final sample has @xmath50 nc events .",
    "the operation of the t2k beam , and hence the target exposure , is not constant in time and varies with the hour of the day and season of the year .",
    "therefore , the effect of time - dependent changes in the neutrino event rate must be corrected since they can mimic an lv - oscillation signal or reduce the analysis sensitivity .",
    "such effects can be separated into two distinct classes depending on whether they alter the neutrino beam itself or the ingrid detector .",
    "the first class consists of three time - dependent corrections considered for the neutrino beam :    * beam center variations during each run : since the neutrino interaction rate itself is insufficient to estimate these variations , muons collected spill - by - spill with a muon detector just downstream of the decay volume  @xcite are used to estimate the beam center position . for each of the four run periods considered in this exposure , the beam center position as a function of lsp is estimated after correcting for tidal effects at the detector .",
    "these data are then used to extrapolate the position of the neutrino beam center , which is aligned with the muon direction , at ingrid .",
    "lsp - dependent corrections to observed event rate at ingrid due to shifts in the neutrino beam center are estimated using mc .",
    "* beam center variation between runs : changes in the average beam center position between run periods are evaluated using the ingrid neutrino data and a correction is estimated and applied as in the above .",
    "* beam intensity variation between runs : variations in the beam intensity between runs and non - uniform pot exposure as a function of lsp during each run can mimic lv - like effects . to remove such effects a correction",
    "is applied to bring the event rate per pot in each lsp bin in line with the average for the entire run .",
    "the correction is applied for each event based on its run and sidereal phase .",
    "a further correction is applied to make the average event rate per pot of each run consistent with that of a reference run chosen to be near the end of the data taking period .",
    "the second class of effects consists of three additional corrections to account for changes in the response of ingrid :    * event pile - up variations : typically only single interactions in an ingrid module are reconstructed and other interactions in the same data acquisition timing window ( one for each neutrino bunch ) are lost ( pile - up events )",
    ". however , changes in the beam intensity affect the probability of multiple interactions within an ingrid reconstruction timing window .",
    "accordingly , events at ingrid are corrected as a function of lsp to account for the variation in pile - up events with variations in the beam intensity .",
    "the number of lost pile - up events varies between 3% and 7% across the ingrid modules and has a linear dependence on the number of protons in a beam bunch . *",
    "dark noise variations : variations in the temperature and humidity at the experimental site affect the mppc dark rate , which in turn weakly affects the neutrino detection efficiency",
    ". the maximal variations of the dark rate with the sidereal time is @xmath51 .",
    "a correction to account for this efficiency variation has been applied assuming a linear dependence on the dark rate . * variations in the photosensor gain : in addition to dark rate variations , the mppc gain is influenced by environmental changes , and the scintillator gain might decrease over time .",
    "gain changes impact both the reconstruction and the analysis selection ( through the energy dispersion variable in @xmath43 ) and are corrected using a sample of beam - induced muon interactions in the rock upstream of ingrid .",
    "the effect of variations in the charge at the minimum ionization peak of these muons is simulated in mc and used to correct the neutrino event rate .",
    "the size of the correction varies with lsp and does not exceed 1% .",
    "the validity of the above corrections has been tested by separating the analysis data set into day and night subsamples .",
    "though time - dependent differences are expected in the split samples due to , for instance , cooler temperatures at night or beamline maintenance during the day , the data should be consistent with one another when viewed in the lsp coordinate if the above corrections have been applied consistently .",
    "figure  [ beforeaftercorrections ] shows the day and night distributions as a function of lsp .",
    "the two subsamples are in agreement . data before and after all corrections also appear in the figure .",
    "systematic errors for each of the corrections have been evaluated and are listed in table  [ tab : lv : syssum ] .",
    "the total systematic error is @xmath52 , which is small when compared to the statistical error of the final sample , @xmath48 .",
    "-like events per pot as a function of lsp .",
    "data before ( magenta ) and after ( black ) corrections are shown together with the corrected sample additionally split into day ( red ) and night ( blue ) subsamples .",
    "agreement between the full , day , and night samples indicates that corrections to the event rate have been applied consistently ( details in text . ) ]    .[tab : lv : syssum ] summary of systematic uncertainties induced from correcting for time dependent variations in the neutrino event rate .",
    "entries in the table refer to the largest deviation in the sample event rate under a @xmath53 variation of the error source .",
    "the beam position variation between and within run periods have been combined into a single entry in the table . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as expected from the fft method , no indications of lv oscillations are found and @xmath54 upper limits are set for each parameter . those limits are compared with the sensitivity obtained by determining the parameter absolute values for which @xmath55 of some mc experiments generated without lv effects shows higher absolute values .",
    "the contour limits are constructed following a constant @xmath56 method and are shown in figure  [ fig : lv : acas ] for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 parameters that show important anti - correlations . while correlated - parameter analyses have been performed elsewhere  @xcite , this is the first search to do so using all ten parameters simultaneously .",
    "the five harmonics in equation  ( [ eq : shortprob ] ) heavily correlate the ten parameters as shown in figure  [ fig : lv : acas ] .",
    "neglecting the correlations between the parameters will lead an underestimation of the parameter limits .",
    "since these correlations vary with the direction and position of each experiment , any comparison or combination of the limits found by different experiments requires to preserve these correlations .     coefficient plane .",
    "the other parameters are marginalized over .",

    "the t2k experiment has performed a search for lorentz and cpt invariance violations using the ingrid on - axis near detector .",
    "two complementary analysis methods have found no evidence of such symmetry violations for the energy , neutrino baseline , and data set used .",
