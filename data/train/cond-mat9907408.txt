    "experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold atomic clouds @xcite has stimulated a new direction in the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena . basically , the interaction between two confined bosons in a condensate is determined by the s - wave scattering length @xmath0 and it can be either repulsive ( @xmath1 ) or attractive @xmath2 ) . although first bec experiments were commonly realized with gases promoting a positive scattering length , trapped @xmath3li atom gases , which are characterized by a negative scattering length , have raised an increasing interest @xcite justified by the rich and complex dynamics mixing instability and generation of solitonlike structures , which substantially alters the formation of condensates .",
    "furthermore , novel experimental results @xcite suggested the possibility of using so - called _ feshbach resonances _ to continuously detune @xmath0 from positive to negative values by means of an external magnetic field , which brings a new insight into the experimental realization of becs with attractive interactions .",
    "the dynamical behaviors of gases with negative scattering length are especially interesting , because in the absence of trapping the condensate is described by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , whose localized , multi - dimensional solutions are unstable and may collapse in finite time ( for a review see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "similarly , collapse also occurs in confined condensates with attractive interactions , as emphasized by many theoretical works @xcite , and sequences of collapse events have been experimentally detected in becs of @xmath3li gas @xcite , in which the condensate was observed to shrink on time scales of the trap oscillation period .",
    "general conditions for collapse follow from the virial theorem applied to the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the bec wavefunction , @xmath6 is the three - dimensional laplacian , @xmath7 measures the anisotropy ratio of the condensate and @xmath8 characterizes the two - body interaction ( @xmath9 is the atom mass and @xmath10 the trap frequency ) .",
    "these conditions imply the existence of a critical value , @xmath11 , that the total number of atoms @xmath12 must exceed for initiating the collapse . for @xmath13 below critical , attractive condensates are now known to be capable of relaxing to stationary states of the gp equation , reading as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 has the meaning of a chemical potential .",
    "these solutions consist of solitonlike ground states , whose stability was recently analyzed by means of numerical continuation methods @xcite .",
    "it was in particular revealed that as @xmath13 approaches @xmath11 from below , the condensate modeled by this ground state becomes more unstable and no stationary condensate forms for @xmath16 .",
    "besides , a new investigation @xcite showed that bec with large negative scattering length can be modulationally unstable and decay into periodic fringe patterns of parallel solitons , which again stresses the important role of the latter in this field .    in spite of these recent results ,",
    "some fundamental points , however , remain unsolved .",
    "first , conditions for the existence of stationary condensates have never been established for high - dimensional systems and we still do not know how they may be compatible with the conditions for collapse , which mainly follow from the hamiltonian properties of the gp equation .",
    "second , we ignore how trapped condensates can evolve towards ground states .",
    "third , for practical uses , it is highly desirable to know whether stability of stationary condensates can be inferred from their number of particles , _ and from this number only_. the aim of this paper is to answer these questions and to clear up the link between the non - occurrence of collapse with respect to the stability of localized , stationary ground states when @xmath17 . in the following , we review the conditions required for the collapse of two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) condensates and present a rigorous derivation of the stability criterion for the ground - state solutions of the gp equation .",
    "3d isotropic becs are analyzed in the limit @xmath18 , for which radially - symmetric solutions only depend on the radius @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in 2d , the model ( [ 1 ] ) can be employed to describe the dynamics of anisotropic condensates having a pancake - shape geometry with @xmath20 . in this configuration",
    ", @xmath21 exhibits a longitudinal component , @xmath22 , frozen on the gaussian shape @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the condensate dynamics is then basically governed by the 2d version of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with radius @xmath24 .",
    "1d becs are disregarded , since related results are already available in the current literature devoted to optical solitons @xcite .",
    "instead , we focus our attention on situations allowing for collapse , which basically concerns high dimension numbers @xcite .",
    "as collapse properties depend on more than the dimensionality rather than the geometry of nonlinear objects , we only address the stability of isotropic condensates .",
    "> from the viewpoint of the nonlinear dynamics of localized modes , studying multi - dimensional trapped condensates is equivalent to investigating the solutions of the @xmath25-dimensional equation @xmath26 . in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , the time and space variables are measured in units @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ; the new wavefunction @xmath29 scales as @xmath30 , and @xmath31 stands for the trap frequency @xmath10 , which is formally kept undefined for technical convenience .",
    "briefly speaking , collapse occurs as the mean - square radius of the wavefunction , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 accounts for the rescaled particle number , tends to zero in finite time , while the amplitude of @xmath34 diverges in the same limit .",
    "to be triggered off , this singular phenomenon requires special conditions on the initial data @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for the sake of clarity .",
    "these requirements are basically inferred from the so - called `` virial '' relation @xmath37 which is merely derived by multiplying eq.([5 ] ) with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 means complex conjugate ) and by combining the imaginary and real parts of the results , respectively @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 7 ] ) then shows that the mean - square radius @xmath41 inevitably vanishes at a finite time , @xmath42 , whenever @xmath43 and when the conserved hamiltonian integral @xmath44 where @xmath45 fulfils conditions making the right - hand side of ( [ 7 ] ) negative .",
    "two analytical estimates are usually employed to determine necessary requirements on the particle number for initiating the collapse @xcite , namely , the `` uncertainty '' inequality @xmath46 from which the gradient norm @xmath47 blows up as @xmath48 , and the sobolev inequality @xmath49 this expression proceeds from optimizing the estimate @xmath50 by means of variational methods , which amount to minimizing the functional @xmath51 and provide a dependence between the best constant @xmath52 and the quantity @xmath53 . here , @xmath53 is the value of @xmath13 computed with the radially - symmetric ground - state @xmath54 satisfying the nls equation @xmath55 with no trap , such that @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath60 [ free nls ] , a sufficient condition for collapse is @xmath61 . in the 2d case ,",
    "( [ s ] ) then imposes that @xmath13 must be larger than @xmath62 . in the 3d case , sharper estimations of the complete identity ( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath63 , yield the more stringent sufficient condition for collapse @xmath64 , after bounding @xmath65 from below with ( [ s ] ) @xcite .    when @xmath66 , the mean - square radius @xmath67 satisfies @xcite @xmath68 where the strict equality concerns the 2d case only , and @xmath61 is also sufficient for collapse , since it leads to @xmath69 from eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) . because @xmath65 expands as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , this requirement implies @xmath72 . for @xmath57",
    ", @xmath13 must thus necessarily exceed @xmath73 @xcite . in the opposite case @xmath74",
    ", two distinct dynamics can develop : ( a ) when @xmath72 , collapse occurs again within the domain @xmath75 for which the existence of a finite maximal blow - up time , @xmath76}$ ] , makes sense .",
    "in the special case @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , 2d wavefunctions blow up with an amplitude diverging at @xmath79 .",
    "( b ) when @xmath80 with @xmath81 , there is no collapse for @xmath57 : condensates having @xmath82 never blow up and evolve by oscillating with the constant frequency @xmath83 @xcite . for @xmath84 , the latter conclusion must , however , be subdued , because sharper criteria for blow - up may still apply @xcite , so that @xmath82 just consists of a _ necessary _ condition for the absence of collapse .    hence , although reinforced with a parabolic trap @xcite , the collapse generally manifests under specific conditions , such as @xmath85 . in the opposite case , @xmath82 , collapse can disappear and the wavefunction @xmath29 does not systematically spread out , but may instead oscillate or even form _ robust _ solitonlike states . _",
    "this possibility of forming stable condensates remains an open problem for high dimension numbers_. therefore , it is worth knowing whether the stationary bound states of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , expressing as @xmath86 can exist for spatial dimensions @xmath43 .",
    "these ground states are defined by the solutions of the differential equation @xmath87 which functionally depend on @xmath88 and are localized in space , i.e. , @xmath89 at @xmath90 . here , the parameter @xmath88 is sign - opposite to the energy eigenvalue @xmath91 , which corresponds to the above - defined chemical potential @xmath15 in reduced units . to start with",
    ", we examine the precise conditions under which these states may form .",
    "we multiply eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , then combine the results to find @xmath94 , } \\\\ * [ 9pt ] { \\displaystyle y_s = \\frac{n_s}{(4-d ) } [ 2\\lambda + \\omega_0 ^ 2 \\langle r^2   \\rangle_s ] , } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where subscript @xmath95 applies to the integrals computed on the ground - state solution . as @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "are both positive quantities , it is easy to check that localized solutions @xmath98 exist for @xmath99 , provided that @xmath100 unlike their free nls counterparts ( @xmath60 ) , _ confined stationary states can thus exist for negative parameters _ @xmath88 and the requirement ( [ 14 ] ) implies that the energy @xmath101 must be less than twice the mean - square radius of the stationary condensates .",
    "furthermore , the integral @xmath65 for the ground states reads @xmath102 which ensures @xmath103 from eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , as expected . combining relation ( [ 15 ] ) with the existence condition ( [ 14 ] ) then yields the constraint that the hamiltonian must satisfy on the stationary solutions : @xmath104 thus , @xmath105 for steady solutions of trapped becs is strictly positive .",
    "moreover , we can observe from the result ( [ 16 ] ) that @xmath105 _ belongs to the range _",
    "@xmath106 , _",
    "where there is no collapse for @xmath57 if @xmath107 , and where collapse can be prevented for @xmath59_. on the other hand , since collapse implies the blow - up of the gradient norm @xmath108 as @xmath109 [ see eq.([8bis ] ) ] , a sharper condition assuring the collapse at dimensions @xmath110 can be inferred in the domain @xmath111 from the virial relation ( [ 7 ] ) rewritten as @xmath112 - ( d+2 ) \\omega_0 ^ 2 \\langle r^2 \\rangle,\\ ] ] and it reads @xmath113 . from expression (",
    "[ 15 ] ) , @xmath105 can be seen to never belong to this class of hamiltonians .",
    "therefore , as @xmath105 always lies above this bound together with the limit value @xmath114 below which any initial datum certainly promotes the collapse , it is important to investigate the stability of the stationary states @xmath98 .",
    "we first use the heuristic argument , following which the functional dependences of @xmath65 on @xmath29 under the constraint of a fixed particle number @xmath13 provides some qualitative information about stability . indeed , as is readily seen from the variational problem @xmath115 , @xmath98 governed by ( [ 10 ] )",
    "realizes an extremum of @xmath65 at fixed @xmath13 . under this constraint",
    ", we employ the compatible substitution @xmath116 , where @xmath117 plays the role of a lagrange multiplier , and we plug it into @xmath65 to obtain @xmath118 where the integrals @xmath96 and @xmath97 are here expressed in terms of @xmath119 , while @xmath120 .",
    "it is then clear from eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) that @xmath121 admits a global minimum for @xmath57 , whenever @xmath122 . also for @xmath59",
    ", @xmath121 may exhibit a local minimum under the same condition .",
    "the minima of @xmath121 are given by the roots of the identity @xmath123 , i.e. , @xmath124 , which is nothing else but the characteristic relation for the ground states , as this can be refound from eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "this argument points out that the minima of @xmath65 are reached on the stationary states @xmath98 , that constitute stable equilibrium solutions around which any nearby solution can be trapped , provided that @xmath122 .",
    "note that this inequality is always satisfied by all bound states @xmath98 when @xmath43 . for comparison , with the same arguments",
    "the free nls ground states ( @xmath60 ) are found to be unstable and @xmath121 has no global minimum for these dimension numbers .    to derive a more rigorous proof for the stability of stationary wavefunctions , we now perturb the latter by means of the following solution @xmath125 \\mbox{e}^{i\\lambda t},}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 are real functions , which we assume to be radially - symmetric . inserting ( [ 20 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , linearizing and decomposing the resulting equation into real and imaginary parts then yield @xmath127 where the differential operators @xmath128 have the properties @xmath129 @xmath130 with @xmath131",
    ". it is interesting to notice that the small - amplitude perturbations described by eqs .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) to ( [ vk ] ) provide an alternate form of the usual bogoliubov excitations . here",
    ", @xmath98 is supposed to be the unique , radially - symmetric solitonlike bound state of eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) with no zeroes .",
    "so , as @xmath132 $ ] is nonnegative and admits the discrete eigenvalue @xmath133 for @xmath98 only , zero is the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath134 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath98 has no node , @xmath135 possesses a single node .",
    "we then apply a basic theorem from spectral theory claiming that if @xmath136 is an eigenstate for @xmath137 such that @xmath138 , and if @xmath136 has exactly @xmath139 zeroes , then @xmath140 is the @xmath141th eigenvalue ranked as @xmath142 .",
    "this theorem holds when the eigenfunctions of @xmath143 are @xmath144-integrable , which is here ensured since the linear eigenstates of @xmath143 decay much faster with gaussian tails than their free nls counterparts . for @xmath60 , @xmath145 is equal to zero and , therefore , a unique negative eigenvalue @xmath146 exists .",
    "let us now observe what happens with a trapping potential ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "first , @xmath143 has certainly a strictly positive eigenvalue since @xmath147 where @xmath148 denotes the standard @xmath144 scalar product applied to real functions .",
    "second , it is obvious that the vectors @xmath149 and @xmath150 are both orthogonal to the ground state @xmath98 .",
    "a combination of eq . ( [ vk3 ] ) then leads to @xmath151 and , thus , @xmath149 is an eigenstate of @xmath152 with positive eigenvalue . for @xmath134 being positive definite , this property indicates that @xmath153 .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue @xmath154 of @xmath143 is necessarily negative , although larger than for @xmath60 , because @xmath155 attains negative values with , e.g. , @xmath156 .",
    "moreover , @xmath143 has exactly one negative eigenvalue in its spectrum @xcite .",
    "these technical conditions being fulfilled , we look for perturbations growing as @xmath157 with growth rate @xmath158 and determine the condition assuring the stability of ground states by maximizing @xmath159 in the subspace of functions @xmath160 orthogonal to @xmath98 .",
    "stability then results from the proof that @xmath161 is positive under the constraint @xmath162 . according to standard procedures @xcite",
    ", we identify the discrete spectrum of @xmath143 by setting @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is a lagrange multiplier related to the orthogonality condition @xmath162 .",
    "we construct a complete basis of orthonormalized eigenfunctions as @xmath165 , such that @xmath166 , and combine these relations to get @xmath167 in ( [ 22c ] ) , the function @xmath168 monotonously increases from @xmath169 to @xmath170 in the range @xmath171\\lambda_0,\\lambda_1[$ ] . with @xmath146 and @xmath153",
    ", stability follows from the sign of @xmath172 , which must be negative in order to ensure @xmath173 .",
    "as @xmath174 is defined by @xmath175 , we conclude that _ a sufficient condition for stability _ is given by @xmath176 this condition guarantees the orbital stability of the stationary condensate . by `` orbital '' stability ,",
    "it is meant that , modulo the elementary symmetries of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , the shape of a bec soliton is preserved by perturbations having no growing modes , when they act on any solution staying nearby the ground state orbit @xcite .",
    "conversely , @xmath177 is sufficient for any bound state of eq.([5 ] ) to be unstable . if we moreover admit that @xmath178 also leads to instability , condition ( [ 25 ] ) is not only sufficient , but also necessary for the stability of ground states .",
    "identified through numerical integrations of eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , some radially - symmetric , bell - shaped solutions @xmath98 are presented in figure 1 for different parameters @xmath88 and @xmath31 .",

    "dotted lines indicate the variations of the ground - state particle number @xmath179 with respect to @xmath88 for the free nls equation ( @xmath60 ) , namely , @xmath180 in 2d and @xmath181 in 3d @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath179 for @xmath66 always lies below these free particle numbers . in the limit @xmath182",
    ", the solution @xmath98 behaves as free nls solitons , _ which are all unstable with @xmath183_. in contrast , as can be seen from this set of figures , _ trapped ground states are stable _ for every @xmath88 with moderate values when @xmath57 , whereas for @xmath59 , the criterion ( [ 25 ] ) predicts their stability for negative @xmath88 only , i.e. , @xmath184 , where @xmath185 corresponds to the maximum number @xmath186 .",
    "the difference between `` free '' and trapped solutions is that _ the discrete spectrum of @xmath187 is here shifted towards the range of positive eigenvalues_. thereby , stability of ground states seems `` reinforced '' by the parabolic trap , compared with the case @xmath60 .",
    "such a result can not be obtained for a detrapping potential ( @xmath188 ) , because the linear eigenstates of @xmath143 are not @xmath144-integrable in this configuration . even if the above procedure could be applied in that case , eq.([22 ] ) furthermore suggests that at least two negative eigenvalues would appear in the discrete spectrum of @xmath143 , from which instability surely follows .",
    "finally , we have plotted in fig .",
    "3 the temporal evolutions of solutions to eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) with a parabolic trap for various initial data .",

    "3(b ) represents similar evolutions from ground states having @xmath192 , among which the solution initiated with @xmath193 inexorably collapses .",
    "dots show the same initial data undergoing small - amplitude periodic perturbations . from those",
    ", we can observe the robustness of the 2d and 3d ground states of the gp equation , for which both inequalities ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 25 ] ) are always verified .",
    "note that perturbations do not affect the ground state orbits , as long as @xmath88 is far below the critical values beyond which stationary solutions must become unstable , i.e. , @xmath194 for @xmath57 and @xmath195 for @xmath59 .",
    "stability is lost as @xmath88 attains large positive values , in accordance with the criterion ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "we have discriminated the different regions of collapse / no - collapse for the non - stationary solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and determined the exact conditions under which stationary localized states of this equation can exist .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the stationary ground states lie in the region @xmath196 , where collapse is definitively absent in 2d and can be avoided in 3d , and that they are stable provided @xmath197 is positive .",
