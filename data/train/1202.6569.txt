    "<S> pure kinematics suggests that the ejecta emerges at an angle intermediate between the drop surface and the pool , thus @xmath16 should increase with @xmath25 . </S>",

    "<S> this interaction of the drop and the ejecta sheet observed experimentally occurs earlier at higher reynolds numbers , eventually breaking the ejecta sheet . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the interpretation that this interaction is responsible for the irregular splashing observed at higher @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> vorticity also appears to play an important role in the dynamics of the ejecta sheet [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : base](e , f ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the flow around a curved free surface generates vorticity ( see for instance batchelor @xcite 5.14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , concentrated vorticity is observed in the simulations near points t and b at the base of the ejecta , as the flow moves around the base to enter the ejecta . at the early stage of the ejecta formation , both sides of the base produce a similar strength of vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> this initial vorticity scales as @xmath20 as observed previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the difference in vorticity ( absolute values ) between the two sides is observed to increase initially linearly with time , before decreasing again . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this difference is higher for larger @xmath10 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : base](f ) ] .        by looking closely at the neck region during the impact </S>",
    "<S> , we can identify fundamental changes in the vorticity structure as @xmath10 is increased ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vortstructures ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vortstructures](a ) most of the liquid in the sheet originates from the pool , in agreement with dye visualizations @xcite . for the lower range of @xmath10 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vortstructures](a , d ) ] , the vorticity stays concentrated near the free surface at the neck of the ejecta sheet . as there is stronger vorticity generated at the top of the ejecta base </S>",
    "<S> , a vorticity layer of one sign separates the drop and the pool liquids but it remains stable . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 affects the shape of the outer part of the ejecta sheet , as we observe by comparing fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vortstructures](a , d ) , consistently with experimental observations @xcite . for intermediate @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> the interface remains stable in its early evolution . in the bumping case ( b ) , the rising ejecta sheet contacts the downwards moving drop surface . </S>",
    "<S> this creates a shear instability , generating a toroidal vortex structure around the entrapped bubble . in the quartering case ( e ) </S>",
    "<S> , the ejecta sheet leaves the neck region to climb up the drop , pulled by higher surface tension . </S>",
    "<S> this also creates a shear instability between the climbing liquid from the pool and the drop liquid moving down , forming a row of vortex rings of the same sign . </S>",
    "<S> these vortices near the free surface leave their signature @xcite by creating waves below the rising sheet , a feature also observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> however , all such vortical effects are absent from inviscid theory and simulations @xcite    at even higher @xmath10 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vortstructures](c , f ) ] , vorticity is shed behind the base of the ejecta sheet , in a way reminiscent of the von krmn vortex street , here forming alternating - sign vortex rings . for the first 7 shedding cycles , the local reynolds number based on the radial speed and width of the neck takes value around 70 and the strouhal number @xmath29 is around @xmath30 , in good agreement with related krmn streets . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the free surface at the base is also affected by the shedding , reinforcing the oscillations @xcite . during the early shedding [ fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : vortstructures](g ) ] , surface tension effects are higher because of the sharper surface geometry . as the angle of the neck increases , the amplitude of the oscillations increases . </S>",
    "<S> the ejecta can then climb on the drop at lower @xmath5 ( f ) , or impact alternatively on the drop and the pool ( c ) , in a similar way to the bumping , entrapping a row of bubble rings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> four bubble rings can be clearly identified in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vortstructures](c ) , and a fifth one being created . </S>",
    "<S> only well resolved bubbles and droplets ( larger than 30 cells ) are kept in the numerics , suggesting that smaller bubbles could be entrapped earlier .    from systematic experimental observations , reproduced with axisymmetric simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we have detailed a new mechanism explaining the irregular splashing of a water drop . </S>",
    "<S> previously studied mechanisms have described the droplet separation from the rim of the ejecta @xcite , or the destabilization of a liquid sheet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our mechanism however explains the breakup of the ejecta sheet by the destabilization of its base , through vortex shedding from the free surface .    </S>",
