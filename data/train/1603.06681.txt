    "the leptonic flavour violating ( lfv ) decay of the higgs boson @xmath4 , which is a smoking gun for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , has been looked for by both cms and atlas collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and the branching ratio ( br ) is @xcite ( h ) = 0.84^+0.39_-0.37%  ( cms ) ,   0.53 0.51%  ( atlas ) , so that the 95% cl upper limits on the br is 1.51% ( cms ) and 1.41% ( atlas ) . while there is no official averaging",
    ", one might take @xmath5 .",
    "this has given rise to a lot of model building efforts to explain the signal @xcite .",
    "as the @xmath6-@xmath7 pair has an invariant mass suggestive of a parent of mass close to that of the higgs boson , there are only two possibilities : ( i ) by some mechanism ( possibly from mixing with other scalars ) the sm higgs boson has acquired some small flavour - changing ( fc ) coupling ; ( ii ) the leptons are coming from some other scalar degenerate with the higgs boson .",
    "both possibilities have been explored in the literature @xcite , although the second possibility appears to be more constrained from the data .",
    "there is also a third possibility of introducing the lfv coupling through loop effects without enhancing the sm scalar sector ( but other new degrees of freedom may be needed ) @xcite ; however , this is equivalent to the introduction of an effective lfv coupling , as is the case for the first possibility .",
    "let us assume that the decay occurs through a term @xmath8 $ ] in the lagrangian , where @xmath9 is the scalar resonance at 125 gev .",
    "written in full , the relevant term is -y _",
    "( |_l _ r + |_r _ l ) h -y _",
    "( |_l _ r + |_r _ l ) h. [ lfv - lag ] the br is given by ( h ) = ( |y_|^2 + | y_|^2 ) ^2 .",
    "if @xmath0 ( and other possible new decay channels ) have a small br , one can write @xmath10 mev for @xmath11 gev .",
    "the measurement constrains @xmath12 . unless we measure the @xmath6 or @xmath7 polarizations , no further information about the individual couplings can be drawn .",
    "the upper bound from atlas @xcite suggests < 3.410 ^ -3 at 95% cl .",
    "if there is a hierarchy between the two couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 , this is the bound on the larger coupling .",
    "if both are equal , the bound on each of them is @xmath15 times that on @xmath16 .",
    "we will show how far @xmath16 can be probed .",
    "its relationship with the yukawa couplings and mixing angles is model - dependent .",
    "if the new channels have a significant br , one should use = .",
    "note that such a scenario is quite feasible .",
    "experimentally , @xmath17 has a strong lower bound but a very weak upper bound , so even larger values of @xmath16 can be allowed in principle .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath17 from direct measurement is 1.7 gev @xcite and from indirect measurement , 22 mev @xcite .",
    "this makes the @xmath18 upper bound on @xmath16 to be 0.063 ( direct measurement ) or 0.007 ( indirect measurement ) approximately , assuming the only new channel to be @xmath0 , for which one may allow a large branching ratio .",
    "we would like to find out how far the fc coupling(s ) can be explored at the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "while there are such studies in the literature in the context of supersymmetric lfv models @xcite , we would like to give more general constraints based on the updated ilc parameters .",
    "almost all the models that try to explain the fc decay invoke an extended scalar sector . as we have said before ,",
    "there are generically two classes of models . the first class , which we may call the lonely higgs ( lh ) models , has an extended scalar sector , but all the scalars except the higgs boson @xmath9 are heavy . one or more of these extra degrees of freedom may mix with the sm doublet , and that gives rise to a small fc coupling of @xmath9 .",
    "if the fc yukawa coupling of the heavy scalars be @xmath19 and the mixing angle with the sm doublet be @xmath20 , we expect @xmath21 .",
    "the precise relation between @xmath16 and @xmath22 depends on the model chosen and its parameters .",
    "the lh models have been widely investigated in the literature and include type - iii 2hdm @xcite , or scalar sectors with discrete symmetries , or even composite higgs models .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that in a flavour - changing 2hdm , the effective yukawa coupling of @xmath23 is a function of the angles @xmath24 ( the mixing angle of the two cp - even neutral states ) , @xmath25 ( the mixing angle of the charged scalar states , and the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 ( the mixing angle of the charged leptons @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , apart from the fc yukawa coupling of the second doublet .",
    "since the functional form depends on the model chosen , we will not go into any particular model and express all our results in terms of @xmath16 as defined before .",
    "we will also assume all other scalars of such lh models to be beyond the reach of ilc .    the second class , which we may call the degenerate higgs ( dh ) models , involves , apart from @xmath9 , more scalars at 125 gev , some ( or all ) of them having nonzero fc couplings and giving rise to the @xmath6-@xmath7 signal .",
    "examples of dh models are in refs .",
    "@xcite . as these models are not very well investigated but may be interesting from an experimental point of view regarding clear signals or possible falsifiability , let us give a very brief outline of one of the dh models discussed in @xcite .    in this model ,",
    "all the neutral scalars are almost degenerate .",
    "the sm higgs boson @xmath9 has only flavour - conserving couplings ; the other cp - even neutral scalar @xmath31 and the cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath32 can decay to the flavour - violating channels .",
    "the approximate degeneracy is forced by the observed signal , where the @xmath6-@xmath7 invariant mass peaks at @xmath33 .    in the exact alignment limit , with @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "defined before , -= ( 2n+1 ) , which makes the lighter cp - even eigenstate identical in properties with the sm higgs boson . , the heavy cp - even eigenstate is identical to the sm higgs .",
    "this possibility is also not ruled out from the lhc data .",
    "] this is the limit that is favored by the lhc data , but small deviations can still be entertained .",
    "the amount of the allowed deviation depends on the type of 2hdm @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath32 does not have any @xmath34 or @xmath35 coupling , so it can never be produced by the bjorken process or gauge boson fusion .",
    ", double scalar productions from the two gauge - two scalar quartic interactions are anyway negligibly small . ]",
    "if one is away from the alignment limit , the @xmath9 production rate is @xmath36 , and the @xmath31 production rate is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the sm higgs boson production cross - section . on the other hand ,",
    "the fc coupling of @xmath9 ( @xmath31 ) is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ( effective ) fc yukawa coupling of @xmath31 , like @xmath13 or @xmath14 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ lfv - lag ] ) .",
    "one must mention that the simplest version of this model as in ref .",
    "@xcite does not work because the model predicts a large branching ratio for @xmath42 which has not been observed by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "still , one may tweak the model and have a deviation from the strict alignment limit to satisfy all the experimental constraints @xcite .",
    "thus , what one can bound from the data is either ( i ) the yukawa coupling of the @xmath6-@xmath7 pair with the heavy scalar , multiplied by @xmath43 , where @xmath20 is the mixing angle between the sm higgs and the heavy neutral one , for the lh models , or ( ii ) the yukawa coupling of the other neutral scalar @xmath31 to @xmath44 multiplied by a measure of the deviation from the alignment limit , for the dh models .",
    "any further information would require a knowledge of the model , as investigated in ref .",
    "various lfv models were also studied in the literature before this signal came into prominence ; for example , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite .",
    "the designed cm energies for the ilc are 250 and 500 gev .",
    "while it can be upgraded to 1 tev in future , we will work with the two designed energies only .",
    "the reason is that the sensitivity to lfv couplings are best at the low energy options .",
    "ilc is planned to run with four polarization options : p1 @xmath45 , p2 @xmath46 , p3 @xmath47 and p4 @xmath48 respectively @xcite .",
    "the numbers give the degree of polarization of the beams ; for example , the first option ( p1 ) means that the @xmath49 beam is 80% left polarized and the @xmath50 beam is 30% right polarized .",
    "the effective polarization is given by p_eff = , where @xmath51 is positive for left polarized electron beam and @xmath52 is positive for right polarized positron beam .",
    "the projected integrated luminosities for the four polarization options at @xmath53 gev , are ( in fb@xmath54 ) : : 337.5 ,  p2 : 112.5 ,  p3:25 ,  p4 : 25 , which will finally be upgraded to @xmath55 fb@xmath54 respectively . at @xmath56 gev , initial ( upgraded ) integrated luminosities",
    "are ( in fb@xmath54 ) : : 200 ( 1600 ) ,  p2 : 200 ( 1600 ) ,  p3:50 ( 400 ) ,  p4 : 50 ( 400 ) .",
    "the dominant higgs production processes at the ilc are the bjorken process @xmath57 and the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) @xmath58 through @xmath59 fusion .",
    "the cross - section for the former falls with @xmath60 and that of the latter rises . at @xmath1 gev ,",
    "the bjorken process dominates , while at @xmath61 gev , both the processes become compatible .",
    "the final state that we look for is @xmath62 or @xmath63 , with @xmath64 . to reliably reconstruct the @xmath7 from its one - prong or three - prong decays",
    ", one should use the collinear approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath7 is so boosted that the neutrino goes essentially in the same direction as its parent .",
    "if there are no other sources of missing energy , this reconstruction is quite reliable @xcite .",
    "thus , we will not consider the @xmath65 fusion further , first because the contributions are less than those coming from the bjorken process , and second , because the extra neutrinos make the @xmath7 reconstruction more uncertain .",
    "it is unlikely that to get the lfv signal from a 125 gev resonance , one has to wait till the 1 tev upgrade , when the initial options , through the bjorken process , provide a better sensitivity .",
    "option is a must , either at the ilc or the @xmath66 mode of the future circular collider ( fcc - ee ) . ]",
    "if we focus only on the bjorken process , there are no further sources of missing energy and the @xmath7 reconstruction efficiency @xmath67 is about 70% @xcite . in the clean environment of the @xmath66 collider",
    ", the two jets can be detected with almost 100% efficiency ( we do not need to tag the flavour ) , and so can be the muon .",
    "the electron detection efficiency is about @xmath68 , while that of the muon is almost 100% .",
    "note that the @xmath69 channel involves an extra combinatoric , _",
    "i.e. _ one needs to check which muon pair came from the @xmath70 and which one came from the higgs boson .",
    "this reduces the efficiency of the three - muon channel by about 20% compared to the @xmath71 channel . which approximately offsets the gain coming from the better detection efficiency",
    ". a detailed discussion will follow .",
    "there is , of course , one possible source of background as discussed in ref .",
    "this comes from the decay @xmath72 , with one of the tau leptons decaying into a muon .",
    "if the missing energy is small , this can fake the signal event .",
    "we have calculated the number of such fake events , @xmath73 , for different ilc configurations and final states . an explicit evaluation ( at parton level )",
    "was performed by calchep , generating the @xmath74 final state at the ilc , including all possible amplitudes .",
    "we then applied the cuts as mentioned later : the @xmath75 invariant mass at an interval of @xmath76 gev , the @xmath44 invariant mass within @xmath77 gev , and missing energy less than 20 gev .",
    "the cuts reduce the uncut cross - section by at least 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is expected as the @xmath44 pair can come from many sources , not necessarily from @xmath78 .",
    "after multiplication by the @xmath7 detection efficiency @xmath79 and the projected luminosity , the number of fake events becomes completely negligible .",
    "slightly conservative estimate is given in ref .",
    "@xcite which we show in the tables .",
    "while the number of such fake events @xmath73 is completely negligible for @xmath80 final states , it is quite small ( and even zero for some configurations ) for @xmath62 final states too .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the number of signal as well as parent background ( with @xmath72 ) events are much smaller for the former case compared to the latter , coming from @xmath81 .",
    "the second reason is that the tau lepton can be more easily reconstructed in the former case than the latter .",
    "the cross - section for the bjorken process and the subdominant @xmath82 fusion are shown in table [ tab : hprod ] .",
    ".higgs production cross - section for different @xmath60 and polarization options at the ilc . computed with calchep v3.6.23 @xcite with isr and beamstrahlung",
    "options switched on . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in view of the lfv channel @xmath0 with a substantially strong hint at the lhc , we investigate the reach of ilc to probe the corresponding lfv yukawa coupling .",
    "the advantage of ilc is a relatively clean environment and much less qcd background compared to the lhc .",
    "an important aspect of the signal is that any sm background has to contain missing @xmath83 coming from the two neutrinos .",
    "thus , if the higgs boson is produced through the bjorken process and the @xmath70 decays to two jets or two leptons , one may have a signal which is background - free .",
    "this helps us to achieve at least one order of improvement to what we have at the lhc now .",
    "the reach for the yukawa coupling @xmath16 also depends on the integrated luminosity @xmath84 and goes as @xmath85 . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath86 fb@xmath54",
    ", @xmath87 can be probed up to a level of @xmath88 even at @xmath1 gev , which in turn means @xmath89 .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude improvement over the lhc .",
    "the bjorken process is favoured over the @xmath65 fusion because of the absence of missing energy .",
    "the reach also depends on the various choices of the beam polarization options . to compare with the possibility of unpolarized beams , the reach of @xmath16 is @xmath90 for identical @xmath60 and integrated luminosity , when the polarization option is switched off .    from the above discussion as well as from the tables , it is obvious that the discovery will most probably be made at the low-@xmath60 options",
    "this is easy to understand : the bjorken cross - section falls with increasing @xmath60 , which is nothing but a propagator suppression of the amplitude . at @xmath91 tev ,",
    "the vbf cross - section becomes important .",
    "the @xmath65 fusion has neutrinos associated with it and therefore one must take care of the background coming from @xmath92 followed by leptonic decays of the @xmath93 .    the job of the theoreticians is to translate the model parameters , for both lh and dh types to @xmath16 . if the new yukawa couplings are predicted by the model , the experiment will give the mixing angle @xmath20 between the sm doublet and the new scalar .",
    "for the dh models , the data will give the shift from the alignment limit .",
    "the ilc will similarly be a good probe for any lfv couplings of the higgs , like @xmath94 or @xmath42 .",
    "the reaches will be quite similar as one looks at the bjorken process followed by hadronic @xmath70 decays .",
    "note that the @xmath95 final state will have a detection efficiency better than final states containg a @xmath7 lepton , and so the reach should improve .",
    "however , there is no hint for any excess in these channels as yet @xcite , and so we do not go into any discussion of them .        i.c .",
