    "when a quantum dot is connected to superconducting electrodes , the proximity effect drastically modifies the dot s electronic structure due to the local formation of cooper pairs .",
    "the density of states on the dot thus exhibits a gap , so that the formation of discrete sub - gap states arises @xcite .",
    "these andreev bound states ( abs ) play certainly an important role as they may contribute a large part of the spectral weight @xcite and carry most of the josephson current.@xcite a physical understanding of the abs requires to characterize how these states are connected to the atomic ( or molecular ) levels of the uncoupled quantum dot , and to describe quantitatively their evolution as a function of several parameters , such as gate voltage , coulomb interaction , tunnel couplings , and superconducting gap .",
    "whereas the abs have been observed in metal - superconductor hybrid structures @xcite , no direct spectroscopy has so far been achieved in quantum dot systems .",
    "andreev bound states come in pairs , one state above and one below the fermi level , forming a two level system .",
    "consequently , recent interest in the spectroscopy of the bound states has also been stimulated by proposals to use the latter as a qubit .",
    "@xcite at present , several routes have been suggested , such as stm measurements on carbon nanotubes , @xcite microwave cavity coupling , @xcite visible light emission using a josephon diode , @xcite or noise experiments .",
    "@xcite    experimentally , superconducting quantum dots can be realized with carbon nanotubes junctions or semiconducting inas islands .",
    "it has been shown that quantum dots connected to superconducting electrodes can be tuned from a coulomb blockade regime , to a kondo regime,@xcite to a weakly interacting fabry - perot regime by changing local gate voltages .",
    "@xcite the josephson current at zero bias and multiple andreev reflections at finite bias voltage have been measured in such devices.@xcite the transition from a @xmath0-junction to a @xmath1-junction , namely a reversal in the sign of the josephson current , @xcite has also been been observed when a magnetic moment forms on the dot . @xcite as a possible application of superconducting junctions , nano - squid devices have also been fabricated .",
    "@xcite    an exact theoretical description of a quantum dot coupled to superconducting leads is only possible when the coulomb interaction is fully neglected .",
    "hence the interacting single dot system , as described by the anderson model with superconducting electrodes , has been so far analyzed by treating the coulomb interaction with various analytical schemes , such as the mean field theory , @xcite the perturbation expansion in the coulomb interaction @xcite or in the tunnel coupling .",
    "@xcite non - perturbative calculations , using the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , @xcite or the functional renormalization group ( frg ) , @xcite as well as numerical simulations based on the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , @xcite or quantum monte carlo @xcite have also been developped .",
    "none of the analytical approaches mentioned above is able to describe entirely the physics of a quantum dot coupled to superconducting leads .",
    "whereas lowest order perturbation expansions in the tunnel coupling will hardly capture the proximity effect induced by the electrodes  @xcite , mean field and weak - interaction approaches will miss the kondo effect .",
    "nrg calculations on the other hand can capture the physics of such a system over a wide range of parameters , but are numerically demanding and not easily portable to more complex molecular systems .",
    "more importantly , in the view of describing the abs alone , none of these techniques does provide a simple physical picture .",
    "henceforth we will develop in this paper a new perturbative approach based on an effective local hamiltonian for dressed abs , that extends the limit of large superconducting gap proposed previously @xcite , which was used by many authors .",
    "@xcite this approach will illuminate the nature of the abs in interacting quantum dots , which can be generally viewed as renormalized superconducting atomic states .",
    "this will provide as well a simple analytical framework that is accurate in the most relevant cases , and that may thus be useful for interpreting future spectroscopic experiments . in particular , calculations provided in the proposals of refs . and only _ qualitatively _ apply in realistic situations where the gap is comparable or smaller that the atomic energies , even when the gap is large compared to the hybridization to the electrodes .",
    "this interesting regime is precisely the one that we want to address in the present work .",
    "in addition , we note that our formalism , which incorporates the atomic ( or molecular ) levels from the outset , can easily be extended to describe more complex systems , as for instance superconducting double quantum dots or molecules with more complicated orbital structure ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theoretical_form ] , the system is mapped onto an effective local hamiltonian , similarly to the widely used atomic limit , but including the proximity effects due to the superconducting leads . in sec . [",
    "sec : pert ] , the perturbation theory around this limit is set up and self - consistent equations for the abs energy renormalizations are derived in order to extend the validity of the bare perturbative approach .",
    "[ sec : results ] illustrates how this expansion can describe abs in superconducting quantum dots over a wide range of parameters , by a comparison to available nrg data .",
    "we focus in this paper on a single - level quantum dot coupled to superconducting leads , which is relevant experimentally for molecular junctions with large single - electron level spacing . a simple hamiltonian able to describe such a system is given by the superconducting anderson model    @xmath2    where    @xmath3    in the above equations , @xmath4 is the annihilation operator of an electron with spin @xmath5 on the dot , @xmath6 that of an electron with spin @xmath5 and wave vector @xmath7 in the lead @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the leads are assumed to be described by standard s - wave bcs hamiltonians @xmath10 with superconducting gaps @xmath11 .",
    "the phase difference of the latter is noted @xmath12 . furthermore , the leads are assumed to have flat and symmetric conduction bands ,",
    "i.e. the kinetic energy @xmath13 measured from the fermi level ranges in @xmath14 $ ] and the density of states is @xmath15 .",
    "we assume @xmath7-independent and symmetric tunneling amplitudes @xmath16 between the dot and both superconducting leads .",
    "the dot has a level energy @xmath17 and coulomb interaction @xmath18 .",
    "experimentally , the crucial characteristic energy scales , namely coulomb interaction @xmath18 , total hybridization @xmath19 and gap @xmath20 , are typically all of the same order of magnitude , @xcite providing a challenge for analytical methods .",
    "the physics of the quantum dot can be described via its green s function @xmath21 where the nambu spinor @xmath22 has been introduced . because we will only be interested in stationary equilibrium physics , @xmath23",
    "shall be computed in the matsubara frequency formalism .",
    "as the above hamiltonian has no exact solution , some approximations must be made . among the physical ingredients we want to include in a non - perturbative way",
    "is the local pairing on the dot that is crucial for the evolution of the andreev bound states .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb interaction shall be taken into account in an exact manner in order to describe the atomic states faithfully , and to highlight how these are adiabatically connected to the abs .",
    "however , the usual development in weak tunnel coupling @xmath16 around the atomic limit @xcite is not sufficient to describe the proximity effect at lowest order .",
    "therefore , we shall consider in what follows an expansion around a _ superconducting atomic limit_.    such simple solvable limiting case of the model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_complete_normal ] ) is often referred to as the limit of large gap @xmath24 , and has been discussed previously  @xcite .",
    "expansions for finite @xmath20 have not however been discussed to our knowledge , and are the topic of this paper .",
    "we emphasize from the outset ( see equation  ( [ eq : greens_leads_nambu ] ) below ) , that the superconducting atomic limit as used normally in the literature corresponds to the limit @xmath25 ( i.e. infinite electronic bandwidth ) , taken before @xmath24 .",
    "the order of the two limits is crucial : if the limit @xmath24 was to be taken first , the dot would be completely decoupled from the leads and the proximity effect would be lost , so that the limit of infinite gap would reduce to the usual atomic limit .",
    "as will be shown now , the superconducting atomic limit should rather be interpreted as a low frequency expansion , i.e. a limit where the gap is much larger than the characteristic frequencies of the dot .",
    "we start off by deriving the green s function defined in eq . using the equations of motion .",
    "thereby , the coulomb interaction @xmath18 will at first be omitted for the sake of clarity .",
    "note that in the end , @xmath18 will simply give an extra contribution which adds to the effective hamiltonian .",
    "fourier transformation straightforwardly yields    @xmath26    in eq .",
    ", @xmath27 is a fermionic matsubara frequency , @xmath28 the bare green s function in nambu space of electrons with a wave vector @xmath7 in the lead @xmath29 , and the pauli matrices @xmath30 have been introduced .",
    "transforming the sum over wave vectors @xmath7 into an integral over energies yields    @xmath31    in the limit @xmath32 , the green s function becomes purely _",
    "static _ and reduces to    @xmath33    note that the low frequency limit we consider here yields a green s function that indeed depends on the finite bandwidth @xmath34 , and this shows that the limit @xmath35 shall not be taken for the proximity effect to survive . in what follows , we will therefore keep both @xmath34 and @xmath20 finite . plugging eq . into the green s function @xmath36 leads to the same result as would have been obtained with the effective local hamiltonian    @xmath37    where the local pairing amplitude induced by the leads on the dot reads @xmath38 which explicitly depends on the ratio @xmath39 . by an appropriate gauge transformation for the operators",
    "@xmath40 , it is always possible to choose @xmath41 , as shall be done from now on .",
    "the complete local effective hamiltonian is obtained when the coulomb interaction is taken into account again .",
    "defining @xmath42 , the energy level of the dot is shifted such that the hamiltonian clearly exhibits particle - hole symmetry for @xmath43 :    @xmath44    the physical interpretation of this effective local hamiltonian is simple . for finite gap ,",
    "the quantum dot is coupled to both the cooper pairs and the quasiparticles in the leads .",
    "the cooper pairs , which lie at the fermi level , are responsible for the proximity effect . the quasiparticles give rise to conduction electrons excitations with energies higher than the gap @xmath20 . in the limit @xmath32 , the quasiparticles are far in energy and the coupling between them and the dot vanishes , which greatly simplifies the physics and makes an exact solution possible . yet , as the dot is still coupled to the cooper pairs at the fermi level , the proximity effect survives with a local pairing term proportional to the hybridization @xmath45 between dot and leads .",
    "as the coulomb interaction simply yields an extra energy shift of @xmath46 for both empty and doubly occupied dot , the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the local effective hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h_eff ] ) are readily obtained by a bogoliubov transformation  @xcite , in perfect analogy with solution of the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath47 has thus four eigenstates , the singly occupied spin @xmath48 states @xmath49 and @xmath50 with energy @xmath51 , and two bcs - like states given by    @xmath52 denotes the empty dot and @xmath53 the doubly occupied dot . the amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "can always be chosen to be real with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the energies corresponding to these bcs - like states are @xmath58 .    , energy level @xmath59 and hybridization @xmath45 to superconducting electrodes in the effective local limit .",
    "the transition line corresponds to @xmath60 . ]",
    "as @xmath61 is always larger than @xmath62 , the effective local hamiltonian has two possible ground states : the low energy bcs - like state @xmath63 or the degenerate spin @xmath48 doublet @xmath64 . in the @xmath63 state ,",
    "the energy is minimized for @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the spin singlet phase corresponds to a @xmath0-junction ( a result well known from the weak coupling limit  @xcite ) .",
    "the transition between the singlet phase and the spin @xmath48 doublet takes place at @xmath66 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diag - inf ] shows the corresponding phase diagram for variable @xmath59 , @xmath67 and @xmath18 .",
    "the state adopted by the quantum dot in the large gap limit therefore results from a competition between the local pairing ( induced by the proximity effect and characterized by the hybridization @xmath45 ) and the coulomb interaction .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , the coupling to superconducting leads induces a gap in the spectral function of the dot , inside which discrete andreev bound states can form .",
    "the spectral function of the dot shows therefore sharp peaks , which could be measured by stm @xcite or microwave-@xciteoptical @xcite experiments as proposed recently .",
    "these peaks indicate addition energies at which an electron may enter ( or leave ) the dot , and correspond therefore to transitions between states with @xmath68 and @xmath69 electrons .",
    "hence , the abs peaks in the spectral function may be interpreted as transitions between the superconducting atomic levels of the dot @xmath70 , possibly renormalized by single - particle tunneling events neglected in @xmath47 ( to be included in the next section ) .",
    "furthermore , transitions from a spin @xmath48 doublet to a spin singlet necessarily involve an electron exchange between the dot and the superconducting leads .",
    "as the states @xmath63 and @xmath71 correspond to the superposition of an empty and doubly occupied dot , this electron exchange and the final singlet states can be understood within the andreev reflection picture .",
    "putting everything together , our effective local hamiltonian in eq .",
    "describes the energies of the andreev bound states as transition energies from the spin 1/2 doublet to the spin singlet states.@xcite there are thus four andreev bound states in the large gap limit for the model ( [ eq : hamiltonian_complete_normal ] ) , with energy @xmath72 and @xmath73 which read :    @xmath74    the @xmath0/@xmath1 transition corresponds to the crossing of the @xmath63 and @xmath75 states , which occurs for @xmath76 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is not sufficient to obtain satisfying results for all regimes of parameters .",
    "first , @xmath47 only describes the @xmath0/@xmath1-junction transition due to the competition between a local moment state ( stabilized by the coulomb blockade ) and a spin singlet ( induced by the proximity effect ) .",
    "however , if the coulomb interaction is strong ( i.e. @xmath77 below the kondo temperature ) , the local moment can be screened by the kondo effect , which will compete with the superconducting gap for the @xmath78 transition , so that a typical scaling in the ratio of the kondo temperature to the gap @xmath20 will appear .",
    "also , the josephson current in the @xmath1-phase identically vanishes from @xmath47 , as the spin doublet does not disperse with the superconducting phase difference , a limitation of the large gap limit . on a more quantitative basis ,",
    "the experimental gap @xmath20 is usually of the order of a few kelvins , which is also the typical scale for both @xmath45 and @xmath18 in carbon nanotube quantum dot devices .    in order to extend the description of the quantum dot s physics , energy corrections",
    "shall be calculated with a perturbation theory around the effective hamiltonian .",
    "once these corrections have been obtained , physical observables like the josephson current may be computed via the free energy @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the inverse temperature .",
    "therefore , it is most convenient to work in an action based description , which directly yields the partition function @xmath81 .",
    "following ref . , we first integrate over the fermions in the leads . omitting the resulting irrelevant constant ,",
    "the partition function reads    @xmath82    where we have introduced the grassmann nambu spinors at matsubara frequency @xmath83 ,    @xmath84    denoting the grassmann fields associated with electrons in the dot by @xmath85 and @xmath40 .",
    "the perturbation consists of the terms in eq . that are not contained in the action @xmath86 corresponding to the effective local hamiltonian . a simple identification yields    @xmath87    note that @xmath86 contains the local pairing term derived in section [ subsec : local_eff_ham ] .",
    "the proximity effect is thus treated non - perturbatively ( just like the coulomb interaction ) , which is the crucial ingredient of our analytic approach .",
    "the perturbation @xmath88 simply corresponds to the tunnel coupling between the dot and the electrodes other than the lowest order proximity effect .",
    "the actual corrections are calculated by expanding the partition function to the first order in @xmath88 according to    @xmath89    which we then identify with @xmath90 where the renormalized superconducting atomic levels @xmath91 and @xmath92 are obtained from : @xmath93    because the coulomb interaction is taken into account , wick s theorem can not be used to calculate @xmath81 . instead",
    ", expectation values are calculated using lehmann representation .",
    "explicit calculations may be found in the appendix . in the zero temperature limit @xmath94 , the energy corrections are    @xmath95    with the quasiparticle energy @xmath96 .",
    "- yield the first corrections to the energy levels , so that the bound states energies @xmath97 and @xmath98 are simply shifted by @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "obviously , these expressions are logarithmically divergent when the bound states energies @xmath97 and @xmath98 approach the gap edge , and are therefore only valid as long as e.g. @xmath101 $ ] . in the limit of large gap @xmath102 , these corrections to @xmath97 are thus of the order @xmath103 , so that the small dimensionless parameter is indeed @xmath104 .",
    "however , this peculiar logarithmic dependence of the abs energy renormalization shows that doing a straightforward @xmath105 expansion around the effective local hamiltonian will be rapidly uncontrolled , and will have a hard time reproducing the logarithmic singularities at @xmath20 close to @xmath97 .",
    "for this reason , and also because the large gap limit becomes trivial for a finite electronic bandwidth , as discussed in section  [ subsec : local_eff_ham ] , it was indeed more appropriate to single out in the total action all terms left over with respect to the local superconducting effective hamiltonian , see equation  ( [ eq : s_pert ] ) , and do perturbation theory around these .    because our lowest - order expansion obviously still breaks down when the gap becomes comparable to the bound state energy , one would naturally seek to resum the leadind logarithmic divergences in equations  ( [ eq : es])-([eq : e- ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved using a self - consistency condition inspired by brillouin - wigner perturbation theory , @xcite which allows to extend greatly the regime of validity of the perturbative scheme .",
    "the resulting self - consistent equations that we obtain are :    @xmath106    and @xmath107 with @xmath108 , and @xmath109 have been defined in eqs .",

    "the analytically obtained phase diagram is indeed identical to the nrg data for @xmath116 . for smaller @xmath117 , the kondo effect sets in , but the transition lines remain quantitatively correct for @xmath59 near @xmath118 , with increasing deviations from the nrg calculations close to the particle - hole symmetric point @xmath43 at large coulomb interaction u. in this regime , the @xmath0-phase possesses a kondo singlet ground state .",

    "fig : phase - diag ] only indicates the transition line between the spin @xmath48 doublet and the lowest bcs spin singlet , it is also instructive to look at the actual renormalization of the energy levels while varying the gap @xmath20 from large values to smaller ones beyond the critical point .",

    "[ fig : scaling - delta ] shows that , in the limit of vanishing gap , our approach is only valid as long as @xmath128 ( as has been mentioned in section [ subsec : renorm ] ) , because the lowest bound state artificially escapes from the gap .",

    "[ fig : scaling - off_ph_2 ] shows that the dispersion of both abs weakens for increasing hybridization . indeed , the more the dot is hybridized with the leads , the less the andreev bound state energy is sensitive to the bare values of the dot parameters .      in order to further analyze the evolution of the states in the dot as a function of the parameters in the model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian_complete_normal ] )",
    ", we investigate now the superconducting correlations @xmath139 on the dot . for the effective local hamiltonian , these correlations are zero in the spin doublet phase . in the bcs - like phase ,",

    "it can thus be concluded that the correlations should be normalized by the gap if one is interested in measuring only the mixing effect .",

    "furthermore , our results are quantitatively precise if the gap if larger than the hybridization @xmath45 for all values of @xmath18 , while relatively small deviations appear for @xmath143 , as shown by the comparison to the nrg data from ref",

    ", for @xmath145 and at particle - hole symmetry @xmath122 .",
    "solid lines are the results of our self - consistent equations , diamonds correspond to nrg data from ref . , and crosses are perturbation theory in @xmath18 at second order . ]    finally , we analyze how the correlations evolve outside particle hole symmetry . as mentioned above , one expects the correlations to decrease because the dot evolve from a superconducting atomic limit toward a usual atomic limit ( i.e. from the states @xmath146 toward the states @xmath140 and @xmath53 ) . on the other hand , there will be a transition from the spin doublet to the singlet phase and therefore a mixing effect .",
    "[ fig : correl_xi ] shows the competition between the mixing effect ( that increases the correlations outside particle hole symmetry ) and the evolution toward the normal atomic limit ( that lowers the correlations ) if @xmath59 is increased .",

    "we now turn to the josephson current through the quantum dot .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath149 ( where @xmath150 is the free energy ) .",
    "at zero temperature , the free energy is the same than the level energies , so that the josephson current can readily be obtained once the renormalized energy levels have been calculated .",
    "nevertheless , our analytical approach only describes the effective local limit atomic states , and we can therefore only determine the current through the andreev bound states .",
    "yet , it is known that the josephson current also contains a contribution of the continuum of states.@xcite the latter can be of the same order and opposite sign as the bound state contribution .",
    "furthermore , bauer at al.@xcite have shown that the spectral weight of the bound states may vary importantly as a function of the different parameters ( like the coulomb interaction @xmath18 ) , especially in the spin doublet phase .",
    "as we exclusively investigate the effective local limit states , we do not keep track of this effect as well .",
    "therefore , the josephson currents obtained in our approach will only provide a rather rough and qualitative idea of the actual total josephson current .    , @xmath151 .",
    "[ fig : current_xi ] shows the josephson current calculated as the phase derivative of the ground state energy @xmath152 , @xmath153 , for different values of @xmath59 .",
    "one notices two regimes : if the phase is close to @xmath65 , the system will be in the bcs - like state .",
    "as there is no magnetic moment in this phase , the ground state corresponds to a @xmath0-junction ( i.e. phase difference @xmath65 ) . if @xmath154 increases , the energy of the bcs - like state increases ( as can be understood in the effective local limit , where @xmath155 ) .",
    "when the bcs - like state crosses with the spin doublet , the ground state changes and the dot becomes singly occupied .",
    "this magnetic moment leads to a discontinuous jump in the josephson current and the formation of a @xmath1-junction .",
    "again , we notice that the spin doublet is stabilized in the particle hole symmetric case .",
    "in this section we summarize our main results .",
    "first , it has been shown how the hamiltonian of a quantum dot coupled to superconducting leads can be mapped onto an effective local model if the superconducting gap @xmath20 is much bigger than the characteristic energy scales of the dot .",
    "this limit can be quite generally regarded as a low frequency expansion of the green s function of the dot rather than the limit @xmath24 used in the literature .",
    "this enabled us to extend the effective local hamiltonian to leads with a finite electronic bandwidth .",
    "we have then set up a perturbation theory around this local effective hamiltonian and established self - consistent equations for the energy renormalizations of the andreev bound states .",
    "we have derived those equations based on the fact that the latter correspond to transitions between different states of the local effective hamiltonian .    in a last section",
    ", we used our formalism to calculate physical quantities such as the andreev bound state energies or superconducting correlations , and understood how these evolve as a function of gate voltage , hybridization , coulomb interaction and superconducting gap amplitude .",
    "it has been shown that our simple approach agrees well with nrg data in a vast range of parameters , with the main limitation that the kondo temperature is not quantitatively described near particle - hole symmetry .",
    "however , most experimentally interesting regimes should be described correctly by the simple equations we have derived .",
    "the simplicity and portability constitute the main advantages of our approach , if one is interested in the andreev bound states only , compared to extended numerical simulations .",
    "as the perturbative description is analytical and based on atomic - like levels , it should in principle be able to describe more complex systems like multiple quantum dots or molecules with several orbitals coupled to superconducting environments , and be readily applicable to describe future spectrosopic measurements .",
    "extensions of our formalism to the computation of the tunneling current at realistic gap values in three - terminal geometries @xcite relevant for stm experiments should certainly deserve further scrutiny .",
    "we wish to acknowledge stimulating discussions with d. feinberg and c. winkelmann , and thank j. bauer , a. oguri and a. hewson for providing us their nrg data .",
    "the partition function is derived starting from the action s perturbation expansion in section [ sec : pert ] .",
