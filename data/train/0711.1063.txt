    "one of the most important problems in mathematics is the proof of the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) which states that the non trivial zeros of the classical zeta function all have real part equal to 1/2 @xcite .",
    "the importance of this conjecture lies in its connection with the prime numbers .",
    "if the rh is true then the statistical distribution of the primes will be constrained in the most favorable way . according to michael berry",
    "the truth of the rh would mean that `` there is music in the primes '' @xcite .",
    "otherwise , in the words of bombieri , the failure of the rh would create havoc in the distribution of the prime numbers @xcite .",
    "in so far , the proof of the rh has resisted the attempts of many and most prominent mathematicians and physicist for more than a century , which explains in part its popularity @xcite . for these and other reasons the rh stands as one of the most fundamental problems in mathematics for the xxi century with possible implications in physics .",
    "in fact , physical ideas and techniques could probably be essential for a proof of the rh @xcite .",
    "this suggestion goes back to polya and hilbert which , according to the standard lore , proposed that the imaginary part of the non trivial riemann zeros are the eigenvalues of a self - adjoint operator @xmath5 and hence real numbers . in the language of quantum mechanics",
    "the operator @xmath5 would be nothing but a hamiltonian whose spectrum contains the riemann zeros .",
    "the polya - hilbert conjecture was for a long time regarded as a wild speculation until the works of selberg in the 50 s and those of montgomery in the 70 s .",
    "selberg found a remarkable duality between the length of geodesics on a riemann surface and the eigenvalues of the laplacian operator defined on it @xcite .",
    "this duality is encapsulated in the so called selberg trace formula , which has a strong similarity with the riemann explicit formula relating the zeros and the prime numbers .",
    "the riemann zeros would correspond to the eigenvalues , and the primes to the geodesics .",
    "this classical versus quantum version of the primes and the zeros was also at the heart of the so called quantum chaos approach to the rh ( see later ) .",
    "quite independently of the selberg work , montgomery showed that the riemann zeros are distributed randomly and obeying locally the statistical law of the random matrix models ( rmm ) @xcite .",
    "the rmm were originally proposed to explain the chaotic behaviour of the spectra of nuclei but it has applications in another branches of physics , specially in condensed matter @xcite .",
    "there are several universality classes of random matrices , and it turns out that the one related to the riemann zeros is the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) associated to random hermitean matrices .",
    "montgomery analytical results found an impressive numerical confirmation in the works of odlyzko in the 80 s , so that the gue law , as applied to the riemann zeros is nowadays called the montgomery - odlyzko law @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that the prime numbers , unlike the riemann zeros , are distributed almost at random over the set of integers .",
    "indeed , it is believed that one can find arbitrary pairs of nearby odd numbers @xmath6 , as well as pairs arbitrarily separated .",
    "the only thing known about the distribution of the primes is the gauss law according to which the n@xmath7 prime @xmath8 behaves asymptotically as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this statement is called the prime number theorem proved by hadamard and de la valle - poussin in 1896 .",
    "if the rh is true then the deviation from the gauss law is of order @xmath10 .",
    "the analogue of the gauss law for the imaginary part of the riemann zeros ( called it @xmath11 ) is given by the riemann law where the n@xmath7-zero behaves as @xmath12 .",
    "hence , large prime numbers are progressively scarced , while large riemann zeros abound .",
    "an important hint suggested by the montgomery - odlyzko law is that the polya - hilbert hamiltonian @xmath5 must break the time reversal symmetry .",
    "the reason being that the gue statistics describes random hamiltonians where this symmetry is broken .",
    "a simple example is provided by materials with impurities subject to an external magnetic field , as in the quantum hall effect .",
    "a further step in the polya - hilbert - montgomery - odlyzko pathway was taken by berry @xcite . who noticed a similarity between the formula yielding the fluctuations of the number of zeros , around its average position @xmath13 , and a formula giving the fluctuations of the energy levels of a hamiltonian obtained by the quantization of a classical chaotic system @xcite .",
    "the comparison between these two formulas suggests that the prime numbers @xmath14 correspond to the isolated periodic orbits whose period is @xmath15 . in the quantum chaos scenario",
    "the prime numbers appear as classical objects , while the riemann zeros are quantal .",
    "this classical / quantum interpretation of the primes / zeros is certainly reminiscent of the one underlying the selberg trace formula mentioned earlier .",
    "one success of the quantum chaos approach is that it explains the deviations from the gue law of the zeros found numerically by odlyzko .",
    "the similarity between the fluctuation formulas described above , while rather appealing , has a serious drawback observed by connes which has to do with an overall sign difference between them @xcite .",
    "it is as if the periodic orbits were missing in the underlying classical chaotic dynamics , a fact that is difficult to understand physically .",
    "this and other observations lead connes to propose a rather abstract approach to the rh based on discrete mathematical objects known as adeles @xcite . the final outcome of connes work is a trace formula whose proof , not yet found , amounts to that of a generalized version of the rh . in connes approach there is an operator , which plays the role of the hamiltonian , whose spectrum is a continuum with missing spectral lines corresponding to the riemann zeros .",
    "we are thus confronted with two possible physical realizations of the riemann zeros , either as point like spectra or as missing spectra in a continuum .",
    "later on we shall see that both pictures can be reconciled in a qm model having a discrete spectra embedded in a continuum .",
    "in 1999 berry and keating on one hand @xcite , and connes on the other @xcite , proposed that the classical hamiltonian @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath14 are the position and momenta of a 1d particle , is closely related to the riemann zeros .",
    "the classical trayectories of the particle are hyperbolas in the phase space @xmath18 , hence one should not expect a discrete spectrum even at the semiclassical level ( see fig .",
    "[ semiclassical ] . to overcome this difficulty , berry and keating proposed to restrict the phase space to those points where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the number of semiclassical states , @xmath22 , with energy between 0 and @xmath11 is given by the allowed area in phase space divided by @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ semiclassical ] )",
    "\\(e ) = ( -1 ) + 1 [ 1 ]    eq.([1 ] ) coincides asympotically with the smooth part of the formula that gives the number of riemann zeros in the same interval .",
    "this result is really striking given the simplicity of the hamiltonian and the asumptions made .",
    "on the other hand connes started on the same classical hamiltonian @xmath24 but constrained the phase space to those trayectories satisfying @xmath25 , with @xmath26 a cutoff which is sent to infinity at the end of the calculation .",
    "the number of semiclassical states is given by    \\(e ) = - ( -1 ) [ 2 ]    the first term describes a continuum of states in the limit @xmath27 , while the second term coincides with minus the average position of the riemann zeros ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this result lead connes to propose the missing spectral interpretation of the riemann zeros described earlier .",
    "a third possible regularization of the xp model , proposed in references @xcite , is that @xmath28 , which leads to the following counting of semiclassical states ,    \\(e ) = [ 3 ]    this result agrees with the asymptotic part of ( [ 2 ] ) , meaning that there is a continuum spectrum but the possible connection with the riemann zeros is lost .",
    "the main advantage of the latter regularization is that it arises from a consistent quantization of @xmath0 unlike the two previous semiclassical regularizations .",
    "the classical hamiltonian @xmath0 can be consistently quantized in two cases depending on the choice of the domain in the @xmath17 coordinate : 1 ) @xmath31 and 2 ) @xmath28 @xcite . in the first case",
    "@xmath5 is essentially self - adjoint , while in the second it admits a one parameter self - adjoint extension .",
    "we shall consider the latter case .",
    "to do so one first define the normal ordered operator @xcite    h_0 = ( x p + p x ) = -i ( + ) [ 4 ]    where @xmath32 .",
    "the formal eigenfunctions of ( [ 4 ] ) are    _",
    "e(x ) = , 1",
    "< x < n [ 5 ]    where we have normalized @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ". one can show that ( [ 4 ] ) is self - adjoint if the wave functions satisfy the boundary condition    e^i _ e(1 ) = n^1/2 _ e(n ) [ 6 ]    where the angle @xmath35 parameterizes the self - adjoint extension of @xmath5 . imposing ( [ 6 ] ) on ( [ 5 ] ) yields    n^i e = e^ i [ 7 ]    which determines the eigenvalues of @xmath5    e_n = ( n + ) , n = 0 , 1 ,  [ 8 ]    this equation agrees with the semiclassiclassical result ( [ 3 ] ) . in the particular case",
    "where @xmath36 , the spectrum ( [ 8 ] ) becomes symmetric around 0 .",
    "notice that the zero eigenvalue is excluded .",
    "another way to derive this result is by considering the inverse of the operator ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this can be done as follows ,    h_0 = ( x p + p x ) = x^ p x^ h^-1 = x^- p^-1 x^- [ 9 ]    where @xmath37 is well defined since @xmath38 .",
    "the inverse of the momenta operator @xmath14 is given by the 1d green function    p^-1 = , [ 10 ]    where @xmath39 is the sign function .",
    "the schroedinger equation associated to ( [ 9 ] ) is    _",
    "e(x ) = _ e(x ) .",
    "[ 11 ]    which in terms of the new wave function    _",

    "e(x ) - _ 1^n dx ( x - x ) _",
    "e(x ) = 0 [ 13 ]    whose solution is    n^i e = -1 , ( x ) = [ 14 ]    hence we recover eqs.([5 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) in the particular case where @xmath36 . on the other hand , eq.([13 ] ) looks as the eigenvalue equation of yet another hamiltonian that we shall discuss next .",
    "in reference @xcite it was defined an extension of the bcs model of superconductivity , called the russian doll model , whose hamiltonian , when restricted to the one body case becomes    h_rd(x , x ) = ( x ) ( x - x ) - ( g + i h ( x - x ) ) [ 15 ]    where @xmath40 represents the energies of pairs of electrons occupying time reversed states in the band @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the standard bcs coupling constant and @xmath43 a coupling that breaks the time reversal symmetry .",
    "the eigentates and eigenfunctions of ( [ 15 ] ) are given by    ( ) ^i h = , ( x ) = [ 16 ]    comparing ( [ 16 ] ) with ( [ 14 ] ) , one obtains the following map between the eigenstates of the xp model and the rd model    & e_rd = 0 e 0 & [ 17 ] + & h e & + & ( /2 ) & + & x^-1/2 _ e &    in the particular case where @xmath44 and then @xmath36 .",
    "one can add a @xmath42 coupling term in the definition ( [ 9 ] ) of the operator @xmath45 , in which case the correspondence between the rd model and the xp model will cover all the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath46 .",
    "the rd model provides an example where the renormalization group , instead of ending at fixed points , run in cycles @xcite . in the rd model ,",
    "the coupling that runs periodically under the rg is @xmath42 , with a period equal to @xmath47 , while the coupling @xmath43 remains invariant .",
    "this fact in turn implies the existence of several bound states whose number is given by @xmath48 .",
    "if we replace @xmath43 by @xmath11 , the latter equation becomes @xmath49 which coincides with the number of eigentates of the xp model .",
    "incidentally , we would like to mention that the field theory realizations of the cyclic renormalization group , of references @xcite , are at the origin of leclair s approach to the rh @xcite . in this reference",
    "the zeta function on the critical strip is related to the quantum statistical mechanics of non - relativistic , interacting fermionic gases in 1d with a quasi - periodic two - body potential .",
    "this quasi - periodicity is reminiscent of the zero temperature cyclic rg of the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of @xcite , but the general framework of both works is different .",
    "the previous results establish an interesting correspondence between two apparently different models which also suggests a way to add interactions to the xp model .",
    "indeed , the interacting term of the rd hamiltonian ( [ 15 ] ) that is proportional to the coupling constant @xmath42 is basically a proyector operator @xmath51 , with wave function @xmath52 @xmath53 . as we said above , adding that term to the inverse hamiltonian ( [ 9 ] ) would give rise to a @xmath54 term associated to the self - adjoint extensions of xp .",
    "instead we want to add an interacting term that reflects the existence of two boundaries in the bk regularization of the xp model .",
    "the simplest possibility is to define    h^-1 = h_0 ^ -1 + ( |_a _ b | - |_b _ a | ) [ 18 ]    where @xmath55 are two wave functions whose properties will be specified below .",

    "is that the scroedinger equation is exactly solvable , the reason being that it is equivalent to a first order differential equation supplemented with a boundary condition .",

    "the diagram consists of an infinite series of closed loops passing through the origin every time @xmath115 vanishes ( see fig .",
    "[ zeta1 ] ) .",
    "this loop structure is similar to the argand plots of partial wave amplitudes of some physical models with the two axis being interchanged .",
    "however the analogy is flawed since the real part of @xmath118 is negative in small regions of @xmath119 , a circumstance which never occurs in those physical systems .",
    "in fact , the loop structure of the models proposed by bkl is identical , up to a scale factor of 2 , to the model with the potential ( [ 54 ] ) ( see fig .",
    "( [ step1 ] ) ) , where the loops representing @xmath64 , for @xmath102 , are circles of radius 1/2 , centered at @xmath120 . for general models of type i , the loops are not circles but",
    "the real part of @xmath121 is always positive ( see eq.([48 ] ) ) , and therefore they can never represent @xmath113 .",
    "incidentally , this constraint does not apply to the models of type ii , where @xmath122 may become negative .",
    "this suggests that @xmath113 could indeed be the jost function @xmath64 of a type ii model for a particular choice of @xmath71 and @xmath123 .",
    "if this were the case then the riemann zeros would become eigenenergies of the hamiltonian realizing in that manner the polya and hilbert conjecture which may also give hints into the solution of the riemann hypothesis . a complete answer to this problem",
    "is not yet known but we shall present below some encouraging results along this direction .",
    "the first step is to recover quantum mechanically the smooth approximation to the riemann zeros .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to the following condition    1 + e^ 2 i ( e ) = 0 [ 72 ]    where    e^ 2 i ( e ) = ^-i e [ 73 ]    the function @xmath124 gives the phase of the zeta function , e.g.    ( 1/2 - i t ) = z(t ) e^i ( t ) [ 74 ]    while @xmath125 is the riemann - siegel zeta function which is real and even due to the duality relation satisfied by the zeta function ( e.g. @xmath126 ) . the reason that ( [ 72 ] ) is a good approximation to the location of the zeros , can be seen in fig .",
    "[ zeta1 ] which plots the real and imaginary parts of @xmath113 .",
    "observe that in the vicinity of a zero , the curves cut the imaginary axis where @xmath127 so that @xmath128 , which is nothing but eq.([72 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath129 satisfies    n = + [ 75 ]    which asymptotically coincides with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) up to a constant term .",
    "this result can be obtained choosing the following potential in the type i model    a(x ) = - 2 [ 76 ]    whose mellin transform ( [ 27 ] ) gives    \\(t ) = - e^2 i ( t ) + o(1/t ) [ 77 ]    up to @xmath130 terms .",
    "the corresponding jost function is    \\(e ) = 2 ( 1 + e^2 i ( e ) ) + o(1/e ) [ 78 ]    whose zeros agrees with ( [ 72 ] ) asymptotically .",
    "hence the smooth approximation to the riemann zeros can be obtained asymptotically by the potential ( [ 76 ] ) . why this potential is able to yield this result ?",
    "one may suspect that it must implement at the quantum level the bk boundary conditions of the semiclassical approach .",
    "indeed , let us show how this works in detail .",
    "the potential ( [ 76 ] ) corresponds to the wave function    _",
    "a(x ) = - 2 [ 79 ]    which satisfies the equation    h_0 ^ 2 _ a ( x ) = ( ( 2 x ) ^2 - ) _",
    "a(x ) , [ 80 ]    where @xmath131 is the hamiltonian ( [ 9 ] ) . dropping @xmath132 in both sides and replacing @xmath133 by @xmath134 ,",
    "one obtains a classical version of ( [ 80 ] ) ,    ( x p ) ^2 = ( 2 x)^2 - p = 2 , [ 81 ]    which describes a curve in phase space that approaches asymptotically the lines @xmath135 .",
    "we shall identify these asymptotes with the bk boundary in the momenta @xmath136 .",
    "recall on the other hand the boundary condition @xmath137 , which combined with the previous identification reproduces the planck cell quantization condition ,    l_p = 2 , l_x = 1 l_p l_x = 2 [ 82 ]    the bk condition @xmath138 has already built in into the model and this is also reflected in the state @xmath139 which is concentrated near the position @xmath140 . in the model we have proposed ,",
    "the two bk boundary conditions are realized asymmetrically , as opposed to the semiclassical model .",
    "it would be desirable to have a more symmetric treament of them .",
    "this indeed can be done and the results will be presented elsewhere .    the next natural step is to see wether the zeta function @xmath113 can be realized as the jost function of the model .",
    "the analyticity properties of the jost functions implies that @xmath70 must be of the form    \\(e ) = c ( 1/2 - i e ) [ 83 ]    which does not have poles in the upper - half plane ( @xmath109 and @xmath141 are normalization constants ) . in fig .",
    "[ zeta1 ] we plot an example with @xmath142 .",
    "since the real part of @xmath113 , and thus of @xmath70 , become negative in small regions of @xmath11 one is forced to consider the type ii model with two non trivial functions @xmath132 and @xmath143 .",
    "the problem of finding @xmath55 is rather non trivial .",
    "one can in principle fix one of them , say @xmath143 , and try to solve for @xmath132 as a function of the jost function ( [ 83 ] ) and @xmath143 . in the case of the zeta function @xmath144 , with @xmath2 , we were able to solve this problem perturbatively thanks to the fact that the zeta function is bounded .",
    "however for @xmath145 the zeta function is unbounded which may lead to problems of convergence . in any case , it seems clear that one needs further physical insights to make progress into this difficult problem . as we said above",
    ", one needs a more symmetric treatment of the coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath14 , and a clearer physical interpretation of the wave functions @xmath55 .",
    "another important ingredient to be implemented is the duality symmetry of the zeta function which in the present formulation of the model is not manifest but which is expected to play a central role .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented in this work an interacting version of the xp hamiltonian which may ultimately lead to a spectral realization of the riemann zeros , as suggested long ago by polya and hilbert .",
    "the main ingredient of the model is the non local character of the interaction in terms of two potentials which are the quantum version of the semiclassical phase space constraints of berry and keating .",
    "the generic spectrum of the model consists of a continuum of eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit which may also contain bound states embedded in it .",
    "we conjecture the existence of potentials giving rise to the riemann zeros as the discrete spectrum embedded in the continuum . if this were the case that would resolve the emission versus absortion spectral interpretation of the riemann zeros",
    ". this would also open the way to a better understanding of the riemann hypothesis .",
    "we have also pointed out the need to implement in an explicit way the duality properties of the zeta function , which implies a more symmetric treatment of the @xmath17 and @xmath14 coordinates as in the semiclassical model .",
