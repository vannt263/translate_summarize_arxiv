    "measurements of the @xmath0-hadron production cross section in high energy @xmath1 collisions provide an excellent test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations of the @xmath0-hadron cross section @xcite have been available for more than a decade .",

    "these measurements were consistently higher than theoretical expectations from nlo calculations .",

    "the first was an inclusive measurement using @xmath18 decays , where @xmath4 denotes a @xmath0 hadron @xcite .",
    "this measurement was performed for @xmath7 @xcite and was the first to map out the @xmath0-hadron cross section down to zero transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath19 cross - section result , along with an improved fonll calculation @xcite , prompted studies @xcite suggesting that prior discrepancies had been resolved with improved measurement and calculational techniques .",
    "more recently , the cdf collaboration has performed a measurement of the @xmath20 meson cross section using @xmath21 of data through the fully reconstructed decay chain @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , for @xmath20 transverse momentum , @xmath24 , greater than @xmath25 and @xmath26 . with large statistics and a high purity signal ,",
    "the total uncertainty on this measurement is smaller than @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "in addition to being statistically independent , many of the systematic uncertainties of this result are distinct from those of previous measurements .",
    "this result therefore provides a unique and independent measurement of the @xmath4 cross section at the tevatron .",
    "we have measured the @xmath0-hadron production cross section in @xmath35 and @xmath317 decays using the cdf ii detector at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the muon plus charm hadron decay signature was acquired using a dedicated trigger that takes advantage of the muon signature as well as the long @xmath4 lifetime . by selecting an event sample based upon decay length information measured in the trigger ,",
    "it is possible to acquire clean @xmath4 signal samples at lower @xmath36 than have been measured before .",
    "complementary data samples are used to measure the trigger efficiencies for this analysis and monte carlo simulation is used to measure the acceptance . after accounting for backgrounds that mostly arise from heavy flavor ( @xmath220 and @xmath219 production ) the cross section is measured to be    @xmath318    for @xmath0 hadrons with @xmath286 and @xmath7 .",
    "we additionally present the differential cross section @xmath9 in this kinematic region , which extends to lower @xmath36 than previous measurements in semileptonic modes .",
    "we find the results presented here to be in good agreement with other recent measurements of the @xmath4 cross section and in good agreement with fixed order next - to - leading logarithm calculations .",
    "we thank the fermilab staff and the technical staffs of the participating institutions for their vital contributions .",
