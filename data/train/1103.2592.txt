    "searching out effective constituents in the structure of hadrons is a clue to understand strongly interacting systems .",
    "certainly , quarks and gluons are the fundamental constituents of hadrons , but the current quarks appearing in the qcd lagrangian can not be effective degrees of freedom to describe the hadron structure in simple and intuitive ways .",
    "constituent quark models give a simple picture of the baryon structure , reproducing the magnetic moments of the low - lying octet baryons by group theoretical argument and also their masses by the gell - mann  okubo mass formula , which is a consequence of the flavor su(3 ) with its small breaking by the quark masses .",
    "the success of the constituent quark models indicates that the symmetry of quark is realized in the baryon structure through the constituent quarks .",
    "in contrast , baryon resonances are decaying particles into mesons and a baryon by strong interaction , and thus it is natural that baryon resonances may have large hadronic components apart from quark - originated components . therefore",
    ", for the investigation of the baryon resonance structure , the aspect of hadron dynamics is unavoidable to be considered . in this paper",
    ", we discuss hadronic resonance states in term of chiral dynamics .",
    "first , we briefly review the present theoretical status of the @xmath0 resonance , which is now to be considered as one of the typical examples of meson - baryon quasibound states .",
    "then we further develop the idea of the hadronic quasibound state into few - body hadronic systems with kaons .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance is the lowest baryon with @xmath12 .",
    "it is not easy to explain the light @xmath0 mass and the @xmath13 splitting against @xmath14 in simple quark models , once one determines the model parameters in the nucleon sector .",
    "@xmath0 is located in a 100 mev window between the @xmath15 and @xmath8 thresholds and the decay width of @xmath0 is given by the open @xmath15 channel .",
    "thus , for the study of the @xmath0 structure , one needs dynamical description with coupled channels , at least , with the @xmath8 and @xmath16 channels .",
    "one of the powerful theoretical frameworks to describe hadronic resonances in hadron dynamics is the coupled - channels approach based on chiral dynamics , so - called chiral unitary model , in which the resonances are described in hadron - hadron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the elementary interactions of the scattering system are introduced by the chiral effective lagrangian , and scattering equation is solved in a way to keep the @xmath3-channel unitarity . for the @xmath3-wave meson - baryon scattering with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , this approach successfully reproduces the total and differential cross sections of @xmath19 scatterings , and the @xmath0 resonance is obtained as a dynamically generated object without introducing explicit pole terms  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 was found also to be an almost purely hadronic object  @xcite . after reproducing the observed scattering quantities ,",
    "the chiral unitary model can be used to investigate the structure and properties of the dynamically generated resonances .",
    "the mass and width is obtained as the pole position of the scattering amplitude and the coupling nature of the resonance is extracted from the residues of the pole .",
    "one of the important consequence of the chiral unitary model for @xmath0 is that the observed spectrum of @xmath0 is composed by two resonance states having different coupling nature  @xcite .",
    "the two poles for @xmath0 in chiral dynamics was found first in ref .",
    "@xcite and later its significance was discussed in ref .",
    "one of the pole is located at @xmath20 mev with a strong coupling to the @xmath15 channel , while the other is at @xmath21 mev with a dominant coupling to the @xmath8 channel  @xcite .",
    "although these two states appear definitely different positions in the complex plane , due to their closer masses and decay widths , their contributions to the @xmath0 spectrum seen on the real axis are entangled and these two states can not be seen separately in the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "what one can observe in experiments is interference of these two states ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) . as a result of the presence of the two states with the different nature of the meson - baryon couplings , the @xmath0 spectrum depends on the initial channel of the @xmath0 production  @xcite .",
    "for example , if the @xmath0 resonance is created by the @xmath8 channel , the higher pole gives more contribution to the spectrum than the lower pole .",
    "consequently the resonance peak in the @xmath15 spectrum appears around 1420 mev , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "this means that , since initial wight of the @xmath15 and @xmath8 contributions to the @xmath0 production is different in each reaction mechanism , the peak position can be different in each reaction .",
    "thus , when one investigates the @xmath0 properties from scattering experiments , it is extremely important to pin down the production mechanism of @xmath0 in each experiment .     in arbitrary units  @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows the @xmath15 invariant mass spectrum ( red line ) of @xmath22 with @xmath23 calculated by the chiral unitary model together with the separated contributions of the lower and higher poles of @xmath0 . the right panel shows a comparison of the @xmath15 spectra of @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "( the heights are adjusted . ) , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   in arbitrary units  @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows the @xmath15 invariant mass spectrum ( red line ) of @xmath22 with @xmath23 calculated by the chiral unitary model together with the separated contributions of the lower and higher poles of @xmath0 . the right panel shows a comparison of the @xmath15 spectra of @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "( the heights are adjusted . ) , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the evidence of the double pole structure of @xmath0 is given by observing the peak position of the @xmath0 spectrum initiated by the @xmath8 channel , which will be at around 1420 mev and be different from the resonance position observed in other experiments .",
    "since @xmath0 is sitting below the @xmath8 threshold , one can not produce @xmath0 directly by the @xmath8 channel .",
    "a recent work has shown that @xmath25 is a good reaction  @xcite , in which kaon brings strangeness into the system and @xmath15 can not be the initial state of @xmath0 production .",
    "the theoretical calculation  @xcite has also shown that the @xmath0 resonance is produced mostly in backward angles as a consequence of dominant contributions from the two - step reaction , and the @xmath0 spectrum peaking at 1420 mev is consistent with an old bubble chamber experiment of @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "further detailed experiments will be performed at j - parc  @xcite and dafne .",
    "it is also worth to mention that , in @xmath27 reaction , since the resonance position of the @xmath0 produced by @xmath8 will be at 1420 mev with a narrower width , one could have a chance to observe @xmath28 and @xmath0 as separated peaks in the missing mass spectrum of the emitted neutron  @xcite .",
    "the reason that there are two poles around the @xmath0 energies is that the elementary meson - baryon interaction has two attractive channels , single and octet in the su(3 ) flavor language or alternatively @xmath8 and @xmath15 in the particle basis .",
    "it has turned out in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath0 is essentially described by @xmath8 and @xmath15 , and the @xmath29 and @xmath30 channels give minor contributions to the @xmath0 poles . in the single channel calculation",
    "there are a @xmath8 bound state and a @xmath15 resonance in the @xmath8 and @xmath15 channels , respectively , while with the @xmath15-@xmath8 channel coupling , the @xmath8 bound state obtains its decay width to the @xmath15 channel .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the @xmath0 resonance is described by the @xmath8 bound state and the @xmath15 strong correlation .",
    "this is the meaning of the double pole structure of @xmath0 .",
    "there is minor model dependence of the @xmath0 pole positions within the chiral unitary approach  @xcite .",
    "the higher pole , which dominantly couples to @xmath8 , has less model dependence in the pole position , located around 1420 mev , because it is constrained by well - observed @xmath8 scattering data , while the lower pole strongly coupling to @xmath15 has strong model - dependence due to lack of @xmath15 scattering data .",
    "this implies that the @xmath8 scattering data alone can not determine the full structure of @xmath0 , and data for the @xmath15 scattering , such as the scattering length and effective range , are necessary to investigate the structure of @xmath0 further  @xcite .",
    "dominance of @xmath8 in the @xmath0 resonance could be seen in the nonmesonic decay of @xmath0 in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dia ] shows possible one - meson exchange diagrams for the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) transition . since , according to the su(3 ) flavor relation of the meson - baryon couplings , the @xmath34 and @xmath35 couplings are small , the @xmath4 ( @xmath36 ) exchange is dominated in the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) transition .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the transition rates of @xmath39 to @xmath40 and @xmath41 is strongly sensitive to the @xmath42 coupling strengths to @xmath8 and @xmath15 .",
    "the form factor of @xmath0 was also calculated within the chiral unitary approach using the chiral effective theory for the couplings of the external currents with the hadronic constituents  @xcite .",
    "the density distributions and mean - squared radii were calculated from the form factor  @xcite .",
    "the electric radus of @xmath0 at the pole position is obtained as a complex number @xmath43 @xmath44 , whose modules is much larger than that of neutron .",
    "this implies that kaon spreads spatially in wide range around nucleon .",
    "it is also interesting seeing the @xmath0 resonance in the su(3 ) limit  @xcite , to see the role of the flavor symmetry in dynamically generated resonance . in a su(3 ) flavor limit in which the octet mesons and baryons have averaged masses , there are two bound states with 70 mev and 5 mev binding energies in the flavor single and octet channels , respectively .",
    "these binding energies are smaller than typical su(3 ) breaking scale , @xmath45 mev , and therefore the su(3 ) breaking effects should be larger than the low lying hadrons .",
    "this is a different aspect from constituent quark models .",
    "as we discussed above , it is most probable that @xmath0 is a dynamically generated resonance of a meson and a baryon , and especially one of the states can be a quasi - bound state of @xmath8 .",
    "such a quasibound state is called as hadronic molecular state .",
    "hadronic molecular state is a ( quasi ) bound system composed of hadronic constituents which keep their identity as they are in isolated systems , appearing just below the threshold of break - up into the constituent hadrons . driving force to make hadronic molecular states is hadronic interaction rather than inter - quark dynamics and confinement force .",
    "thus , inter - hadron distances inside the hadronic molecular states are larger than the typical size of the low - lying hadrons which is characterized by the quark confinement range . nucleus , which is a bound system of baryons , is also classified into this category .    here",
    "let us consider hadronic molecular states with kaon and nucleon constituents . for hadronic molecular states , pion has a too light mass to form bound states with other hadrons by hadronic interaction , since the pion kinetic energy in a confined system by hadronic interaction overcomes attractive potential energy .",
    "in contrast , kaon plays a unique role in hadronic molecular state due to nambu - goldstone boson nature and its heavier mass .",
    "chiral effective theory suggests @xmath3-wave attraction in the @xmath8 and @xmath11 channels , which is enough strong to form two - body quasibound states .",
    "the mass of kaon is so moderately heavy that kaon kinetic energy in hadronic bound systems can be smaller .",
    "in kaonic few - body systems , hadronic molecular states are unavoidably resonances decaying into pionic channels .    in chiral dynamics",
    "the fundamental interaction is given by chiral effective theory , and for @xmath3-wave interaction , the tomozawa - weinberg interaction is a driving force of the hadronic molecular system .",
    "it is an interesting fact that the strength of the tomozawa - weinberg interaction is given by su(3 ) flavor symmetry and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are classified into the same state vector in the octet representation .",
    "therefore , the fundamental interactions in @xmath3-wave are very similar in the @xmath11 and @xmath8 channel . consequently in these channels with @xmath23 , there are quasibound states of @xmath11 and @xmath8 with a dozen mev binding energy .",
    "this similarity between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is responsible for systematics of three - body kaonic systems , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : family ]",
    ".        the celebrated @xmath5 state with @xmath46 can be classified into the kaonic few - body family .",
    "this state was originally suggested by  @xcite , and recent theoretical investigations shows that the @xmath5 system is bound with a large width in spite of discrepancy between theoretical predictions of the mass and width .",
    "a study based on chiral dynamics predicts smaller binding energy around 20 mev  @xcite . for further investigation",
    "it is extremely important to understand coupled - channel effects of @xmath15 to the @xmath5 system .",
    "if it gives significant contribution , especially it is probable for a larger binding case , one should treat @xmath15 as a dynamically active channel . for this purpose",
    ", one needs more precise data on two - body @xmath15 scatterings  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath47 states with @xmath46 and @xmath48 , which are @xmath49 and @xmath50 resonances , respectively , were studied first in refs .",
    "@xcite with a single - channel non - relativistic potential model .",
    "the @xmath6 system was found to be bound with 20 mev binding energy  @xcite , and later was investigated in a more sophisticate calculation  @xcite based on a coupled - channels faddeev method developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which a very similar state to one obtained in the potential model was found .",
    "recently the @xmath6 state was found also in a fixed center approximation of three - body faddeev calculation  @xcite . the @xmath6 state is essentially described by a coexistence of @xmath51 and @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "an experimental search for @xmath6 was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 state with @xmath46 and @xmath53 , being an excited state of kaon , was studied in a two - body @xmath54 and @xmath55 dynamics  @xcite , in the three - body faddeev calculation  @xcite and in the non - relativistic potential model  @xcite .",
    "the three - body faddeev calculation was done in coupled - channels of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 and a resonance state was found at 1420 mev , while the potential model suggested a quasi bound state with a binding energy 20 mev .",
    "this state is essentially described by the @xmath7 single channel and its configuration is found to be mostly @xmath54 .",
    "experimentally , particle data group tells that there is a excited kaon around 1460 mev observed in @xmath59 partial - wave analysis , although it is omitted from the summary table .    in the potential model calculations of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 states",
    ", it was found that the root mean - squared radii of these systems are as large as 1.7 fm , which are similar with the radius of @xmath60he .",
    "the inter - hadron distances are comparable with an average nucleon - nucleon distance in nuclei .",
    "it was also found that the two - body subsystems inside the three - body bound state keep their properties in isolated two - body systems .",
    "these features are caused by weakly binding of the three hadrons , for which the @xmath61 and @xmath62 repulsive interaction plays an important role to form hadronic molecular states .",
    "we have discussed the structure of the @xmath0 resonance in chiral dynamics . we have found that the @xmath0 resonance can be described by meson - baryon dynamics . due to the presence of two attractive channels in fundamental meson - baryon interactions the observed @xmath0 resonance",
    "is composed by two pole states .",
    "one of the states is a quasi - bound state of @xmath8 located at around 1420 mev and dominantly couples to the @xmath8 channel .",
    "thus , this is the relevant resonance for the kaon - nucleus interaction .",
    "this finding is completely a consequence of chiral dynamics with constraint from the @xmath19 scattering data , not a theoretical ansatz nor one putting by hand , unlike ref .",
    "@xcite in which the @xmath0 position , 1405 mev , is an input .",
    "the double pole structure of @xmath0 can be confirmed experimentally by observing @xmath25 , in which @xmath0 is produced by the @xmath8 channel and the peak position appears around 1420  mev .",
    "the idea that @xmath0 is a quasibound state of @xmath8 can be extended to further few - body states with kaons like @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 having dozens mev binding energy . in these states , a unique role of kaon is responsible for the systematics of the few - body kaonic states .",
    "kaon has a half mass of nucleon and a very similar coupling nature to nucleon in the @xmath3-wave chiral interaction .",
    "this leads to weakly bound systems within the hadronic interaction range .",
    "the hadronic molecular state is a concept of weakly binding systems of hadron constituents .",
    "if a resonance state has a large binding energy measured from the break - up threshold , coupled - channel effects , like @xmath15 against @xmath8 , and/or shorter range quark dynamics may be important for the resonance state .",
    "in such a case the hadronic molecular picture is broken down , and one should take into account the coupled channels contributions and quark dynamics for the study of the structure .    for some specific hadronic resonance , hadrons themselves can be effective constituents .",
    "the hadronic molecular configuration is a complemental picture of hadron structure to constituent quarks , which successfully describe the structure of the low - lying baryons in a simple way .",
    "strong diquark configurations inside hadrons can be effective constituents  @xcite , and mixture of hadronic molecular and quark originated states is also probable in some hadronic resonances  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic molecular state has a larger spacial size than the typical low - lying hadrons . in heavy ion collision , coalescence of hadrons",
    "to produce loosely bound hadronic molecular systems is more probable than quark coalescence for compact multi - quark systems  @xcite .",
    "thus , one could extract the structure of hadrons by observing the production rate in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the auther would like to thank his collaborators for their collaborations on the works presented here .",
