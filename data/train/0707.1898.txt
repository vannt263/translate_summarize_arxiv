    "ideal fluid dynamics has been used successfully to reproduce many aspects of heavy - ion collisions at rhic @xcite . however , even though the hydrodynamic model correctly describes the hadron spectra at low transverse momenta , it fails to reproduce the transverse hbt radii ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) at rhic @xcite .",
    "it does , however , yield the correct normalized oscillation amplitudes for @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we use it here to predict the expected trends for the evolution of the hbt radii at mid - rapidity in @xmath4 collisions from rhic to lhc , including their normalized oscillation amplitudes in non - central collisions .",
    "these trends may be trustworthy , in spite of the model s failure to correctly predict the hbt radii at rhic .",
    "extending the hydrodynamic code azhydro @xcite from rhic conditions to the lhc regime requires a recalculation of the glauber initial conditions to reflect the achieved higher initial energy density and temperature .",
    "some of the expected trends were outlined in @xcite where the initial temperature was increased to 2gev to show the possibility of a transition from out - of - plane to in - plane deformation of the freeze - out source in non - central pb+pb collisions .",
    "such extreme initial temperatures are , however , not likely to be reached in pb+pb collisions at the lhc . we here present predictions for a more realistic range of initial conditions and a better equation of state ( eos ) than the ideal guark - gluon gas without phase transition used in @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics can not predict its own initial conditions as a function of @xmath6 , but it does provide a unique relation between the initial entropy density profile and the final hadron multiplicity .",
    "the predicted increase of the final charged multiplicity from various models ranges from less than twice to more than 4 times the multiplicity at rhic @xcite .",
    "we therefore present our results as a function of final charged multiplicity , parameterizing it through the initial peak entropy density @xmath7 at thermalization time @xmath8 in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we cover the range from @xmath9 ( rhic ) to @xmath10 ( lhc ) .",
    "we use an eos that transitions from an ideal quark - gluon plasma phase above a critical temperature @xmath11 to a chemically non - equilibrated hadron resonance gas below @xmath11 ( rappeos @xcite ) .",
    "the final hadron yields are assumed to freeze out directly at @xmath12mev .",
    "the hadron momenta are taken to decouple at energy density @xmath13gev/@xmath14 , @xmath15mev .",
    "spectra and hbt radii are calculated from the emission function obtained via the cooper - frye prescription @xcite along this decoupling surface . for simplicity",
    ", we compute the hbt radii from the space - time variances of this emission function instead of doing a gaussian fit to the two - pion correlation function , knowing that this overestimates the longitudinal radius @xmath16 by 20 - 25% @xcite . a corresponding overall downward correction",
    "should thus be applied to all @xmath16 values shown below .",
    "as the initial entropy density @xmath7 and temperature @xmath17 increase we reduce the thermalization time @xmath8 , keeping @xmath18 constant .",
    "this yields a reduction from @xmath19fm/@xmath20 for @xmath21@xmath22 , @xmath23 ( `` rhic initial conditions '' ) to @xmath24fm/@xmath20 for @xmath25@xmath22 , @xmath26 ( `` lhc initial conditions '' ) .",
    "( color online ) pion hbt radii for central ( @xmath27 ) au+au collisions as a function of transverse pair momentum @xmath28 ( left ) and of initial entropy density @xmath7 or final charged multiplicity @xmath29 ( right ) . ]",
    "shows the pion hbt radii for central au+au ( pb+pb ) collisions in the out - side - long coordinate system @xcite as functions of transverse momentum and total charged multiplicity .",
    "there are no dramatic changes , neither in magnitude nor in @xmath28-dependence , of the hbt radii as we increase the charged multiplicity by up to a factor 3 .",
    "the largest increase is seen for @xmath2 ( by @xmath30 at low @xmath28 ) while @xmath3 ( which follows @xmath2 at @xmath31 by symmetry ) even slightly decreases at large @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath16 changes hardly at all .",
    "for comparison we also performed calculations with a transitionless ideal massless gas eos @xcite ( not shown graphically ) . in this case",
    "we see the smallest ( @xmath32 ) increase in @xmath2 , about 10 - 15% increase in @xmath3 ( at all @xmath28 ) , and about 25 - 30% increase in @xmath16",
    ". none of these changes will be easy to measure , but one sees that differences in the small predicted changes depend on the eos , in particular on whether or not it embodies a phase transition .",
    "the main deficiency of hydrodynamic predictions for the hbt radii at rhic ( too weak @xmath28-dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and a ratio @xmath33 much larger than 1 ) is not likely to be resolved at the lhc unless future lhc data completely break with the systematic tendencies observed so far @xcite .",
    "( color online ) pion hbt radii for non - central ( @xmath1fm ) au+au collisions as a function of azimuthal angle @xmath34 for different pair momenta @xmath28 , for `` rhic '' initial conditions ( see text ) . ]",
    "one of the strengths of azhydro is simulating anisotropic , non - central collisions . for rhic initial conditions , although the magnitudes of the hbt radii in central collisions were not predicted accurately , their normalized oscillation amplitudes at small @xmath28 ( which measure the source eccentricity at freeze - out @xcite ) were correctly reproduced @xcite .",
    "their extrapolation to lhc initial conditions may therefore have predictive power .    in figures [ oscillationrhic ] and [ oscillationlhc ]",
    "we show the azimuthal oscillations of the hbt radii for semiperipheral au+au collisions at @xmath1fm , for both `` rhic '' and `` lhc '' initial conditions defined above . at low pair momentum @xmath28 , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 show an inversion of the sign of the oscillation amplitude between rhic and lhc .",
    "this is indicative of a transition from out - of - plane to in - plane deformation of the source at freeze - out @xcite .",
    "shows cuts through the decoupling surface ( as well as through the hypersurfaces indicating the transition from qgp to mixed phase and from mixed phase to hadron gas ) along the @xmath35 and @xmath36 axes ( in - plane and out - of - plane , respectively ) for `` lhc '' initial conditions : one observes that the source is initially wider in the @xmath36-direction ( out - of - plane ) , but later becomes larger in the @xmath35-direction ( in - plane ) . with an ideal gas eos",
    "this shape transition requires much higher initial entropy densities and temperatures @xcite .",
    "retiere and lisa @xcite introduced the normalized @xmath37 order fourier components @xmath38 of @xmath39 , shown in as functions of @xmath28 and @xmath7 .",
    "they showed @xcite that the zero - momentum limit of @xmath40 is a direct measure of the spatial source eccentricity at freeze - out :    ( color online ) same as , but for `` lhc '' initial conditions . ]",
    "@xmath41 . using this relationship , the lower left panel in shows that the freeze - out source eccentricity flips sign between rhic and lhc , and that at lhc the freeze - out source is elongated in the reaction plane direction by about as large a factor as it was still out - of - plane elongated in the rhic case .",
    "this is different in runs with an ideal massless gas eos where even with `` lhc initial conditions '' the final freeze - out source is found to be still out - of - plane elongated ( although just barely so ) .",
    "( color online ) normalized hbt oscillation amplitudes as a function of @xmath28 at rhic and lhc ( top ) and as function of @xmath7 for two values of @xmath28 ( bottom ) . ]",
    "by varying the initial entropy density to control the final charged multiplicity , we used the hydrodynamic model to predict trends for the pion hbt radii from au+au or pb+pb collisions as one moves from rhic to lhc energies . in spite of a documented failure of the hydrodynamic model to reproduce the hbt radii measured at rhic ,",
    "the model has had great success for most other soft - hadron observables , so the predicted trends may still be trustworthy .",
    "we find very little variation in the hbt radii for central collisions , and whatever small differences we see depends sensitively on details of the equation of state , in particular whether or not it embodies a quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "clear and characteristic changes are predicted for the normalized azimuthal oscillation amplitudes of the hbt radii from non - central collisions , indicative of a qualitative change of the shape of the source at freeze - out which evolves from an out - of - plane elongated freeze - out configuration at rhic to an in - plane elongated shape at the lhc . + * acknowledgements : * this work was supported by the u.s .",
