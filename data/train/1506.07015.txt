    "photometry , the measurement of source brightness in a given wavelength range , is one of the most fundamental techniques in astronomy . it is practised throughout the electromagnetic spectrum , and x - ray astronomy is no exception . in optical astronomy",
    ", photometric passbands have been standardised between observatories since the introduction of the johnson and morgan system @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "the benefits of a well - defined set of photometric x - ray bands have been recognised before , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but despite more than 50 years of x - ray astronomy , there is as yet no system of photometric passbands that applies to more than a single x - ray observatory . in this letter",
    "i will describe the concept of synthesized x - ray passbands that can be applied to existing and future x - ray astronomy instruments , and so permit the establishment of standard , multi - mission x - ray photometric passbands . as an example , i will show that the _ rosat _ pspc 0.5 - 2 kev passband can be synthesized with the _ xmm - newton _ epic pn camera , so that x - ray photometry gathered with _",
    "rosat _ and _ xmm - newton _ can be compared directly .",
    "i will adopt a definition of photometry as the measurement of source brightness through a well defined passband relative to some standard reference . the standard reference could be an astronomical object such as the star vega .",
    "alternatively it could be a theoretical reference , such as the constant flux density spectrum used as a reference in the ab system @xcite , provided that the throughput of the instrument performing the photometric measurements is sufficiently well calibrated .",
    "almost all measurements of source brightness in x - ray astronomy may be considered to conform to such a definition : the curves of effective area against energy commonly employed in x - ray astronomy represent well defined passbands which have already been calibrated in physical units .",
    "however , where x - ray photometry is disadvantaged with respect to e.g. optical photometry , is that each instrument on each x - ray observatory has a different effective area curve . to mitigate this problem ,",
    "x - ray astronomers have developed tools such as pimms @xcite which allow a measurement with one instrument to be translated into a predicted count rate for a different instrument , given a model for the x - ray spectrum of the source . however ,",
    "if the spectrum of the source is not known or is only poorly determined , then the predicted count rate will not be accurate .    in a photon counting detector , as usually employed in x - ray astronomy instrumentation , the count rate @xmath0 can be related to the spectrum of a source and the effective area of the instrument as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is frequency , @xmath3 is planck s constant , @xmath4 is the flux per unit frequency interval of the source and @xmath5 is the effective area of the instrument . for an imaging system",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath5 is the overall effective area of the instrument and telescope combined .",
    "the limits @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the minimum and maximum frequencies at which @xmath5 is significant .    if we define @xmath8 and @xmath9 so that @xmath10 is the normalised respose curve of the system , then @xmath11    the fundamental quantity measured in astronomical photometry is the quantity on the right hand side of equation  [ eq : photometry ] , the integral over the passband of the flux of the source multiplied by the response of the system .",
    "the quantity on the left hand side of equation  [ eq : photometry ] is the measurement itself , the count rate divided by the peak effective area of the system . in optical astronomy the measurement is usually expressed as a magnitude @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the zeropoint , defined such that a reference standard has zero magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". a vega - based magnitude system would not be appropriate in the x - ray regime , because vega has yet to be convincingly detected as an x - ray source @xcite , but the ab magnitude system would be well suited to x - ray astronomy . nonetheless , the adoption of magnitudes as a convenient unit is not necessary for the establishment of a system of photometric passbands in x - ray astronomy . what _ is _ essential is the ability to perform the measurement described by equation  [ eq : photometry ] with different instruments on different observatories with similar response functions , or passbands , @xmath10",
    "the synthesis of a passband is only possible for instruments which discriminate the energies of the incoming photons . in x - ray astronomy",
    ", data are usually telemetered to earth as ` event lists ' , in which the individual photons are listed with their properties such as arrival time , position on the detector and energy channel .",
    "the energy resolution of non - dispersive charge - coupled device ( ccd ) based x - ray instruments is limited , usually @xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the relationship between energy channel and ( real ) photon energy is described by the redistribution matrix .",
    "the redistribution matrix contains , for a sequence of discrete energy ranges , the probability of a photon within that energy range being recorded in each of the energy channels .",
    "i will refer to the product of the redistribution matrix and the effective area as a function of energy ( i.e. for each discrete energy range , the channel probability distribution multiplied by the effective area in that energy range ) as the response matrix . for each energy channel @xmath16",
    ", the response matrix contains the effective area for that channel as a function of energy , and therefore frequency @xmath17 .",
    "x - ray astronomers choose passbands for their instruments by selecting ranges of energy channels which correspond to their desired energy ranges ; the _ chandra _ acis bands advocated by @xcite , and the bands chosen for the 2xmm catalogues @xcite are examples of this approach , and i will refer to these bands as natural instrumental passbands . for natural passbands ,",
    "the count rate in the band @xmath0 is related to the count rates in the individual energy channels @xmath18 by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the minumum and maximum channels of the passband .",
    "the effective area of the band @xmath5 is related to the effective areas @xmath17 of the individual channels by @xmath22 while natural passbands can be chosen to cover similar energy ranges with different instruments on different missions , there is little scope in this approach to control ( and thus standardize ) the shapes @xmath10 of the passbands .    to synthesize a passband , it must be possible to control the shape as well as the energy range",
    "this can be accomplished by assigning weights @xmath23 to the channels that form the band when calculating the count rate within the band .",
    "thus for a synthesized band : @xmath24 and @xmath25 the weights can be chosen so that the synthesized band has a response @xmath10 as close as possible to the response desired . the weights @xmath23 therefore act as a synthetic filter , controlling the shape of the passband .",
    "the capability to compose and apply the synthetic filter after the data have been taken is a distinct advantage of x - ray instrumentation compared to that employed for photometry at longer wavelengths .",
    "in order to synthesize a passband with an instrument , the instrument must be sensitive over a similar or larger frequency range than that covered by the passband . the degree to which the shape of a passband can be controlled by the choice of the weights @xmath23 depends on the width of the channel distribution at a given energy in the response matrix ( i.e. the energy resolution of the instrument ) and to a lesser degree on the shape of this distribution .",
    "the introduction of the weights @xmath23 implies a reduction in the signal to noise of the count rate with respect to that in a natural passband .",
    "in general , x - ray instruments have improved in both spectral resolution and collecting area with time , and this trend is expected to continue with the future european space agency mission _ athena _ @xcite . thus it is more practical to use present - day or future instruments to synthesize the natural bands of earlier x - ray astronomy instruments than the other way round .    in general , the more closely the response curves",
    "@xmath10 of two passbands match , the more similar the photometry will be between them . therefore the best photometric performance from a synthesized band will be obtained by choosing the weights @xmath23 to match as closely as possible the desired @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the smoother , and more uniform the @xmath23 , the higher the signal to noise will be .",
    "therefore , in choosing the weights @xmath23 , there might be some trade - off between obtaining the desired shape @xmath10 and maximising the signal to noise ratio , particularly if the best match to @xmath10 corresponds to large fluctuations in @xmath23 between adjacent channels .",
    "another consideration is that the count rate in a synthesized band will no longer be poisson distributed as it is in natural bands ; instead it will be distributed as the sum of the weighted poisson distributions , and error analysis is more involved",
    ". however , the subtraction of background also causes the count rates of sources to deviate from poisson statistics , and this is routinely performed in x - ray astronomy already , so the importance of this consideration should not be exaggerated .",
    "nonetheless , the reduction of signal to noise and the increased complexity of error analysis are disadvantages associated with synthesized passbands , to be traded off against the advantages of standardising the passbands between missions .",
    "as an example , i will now show that the 0.5 - 2 kev band of the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter can be synthesized with the _ xmm - newton _",
    "european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn instrument @xcite .",
    "to date the only imaging all - sky survey carried out in x - rays used the _ rosat _ pspc , so this instrument has provided photometric measurements of a large body of x - ray sources @xcite . many of these sources have been observed subsequently with _",
    "xmm - newton_. it would be useful to be able to compare directly the photometric measurements from _ rosat _ and _ xmm - newton _ , for example to study the long term variability of x - ray sources . following the logic of section  [ sec : considerations ] , it is more practical to synthesize the _ rosat _ pspc passband with the xmm - newton epic pn than the other way around , because epic pn has better energy resolution , and a larger effective area than the pspc .    the _ rosat _ pspc 0.5 - 2 kev band is formed from pspc energy channels 52  201 .",
    "the normalised response @xmath10 of this band is shown as the grey curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : passbands ] .",
    "the distribution of weights @xmath23 to be applied to the epic - pn channels was obtained by iteratively adjusting the weights so as to minimize the sum of the squares of the difference between the pspc and synthesized response @xmath10 at each point of the @xmath10 curve over the frequency range of the synthetic band , i.e. a least - squared fit .",
    "no smoothing critera were applied during the fitting of the weights .",
    "[ fig : weights ] shows the channel weights @xmath23 corresponding to the synthesized passband .",
    "the distribution of @xmath23 is quite smooth with fluctuations between adjacent channels rarely exceeding 2 per cent , so smoothing the @xmath23 would have little impact on the signal to noise ratio of photometry through the synthesized band .",
    "the synthesized @xmath10 is shown as the black , dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : passbands ] .",
    "the match between the _ rosat _ pspc and epic pn synthesized bands is good , with @xmath10 differing by less than 0.01 over most of the band , and by no more than 0.05 at any point .",
    "however , the weak tail in the synthesized passband which stretches to higher frequency is irreducible , because it corresponds to the low energy tail of the ccd response .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to investigate the performance of the synthesized band in reproducing pspc photometry , i have similated a number of spectral models and folded them through the responses of the pspc , epic - pn and the synthesized 0.52 kev band using xspec11 @xcite .",
    "for the normal epic - pn 0.52 kev response , i simply selected the pn channels that have nominal energies within the range 0.52 kev .",
    "the spectral models were chosen to span the range of spectral shapes typically exhibited by sources in the 0.52 kev band , and comprise power laws , with photon index @xmath261 , 2 and 3 , a power law with @xmath27 , absorbed by cold gas with a column density of @xmath28  @xmath29 , optically thin thermal plasmas ( mekal in xspec ) with @xmath300.3 , 0.7 and 1.5 kev , and a black body with @xmath300.3  kev .",
    "each of the spectral models was normalised so as to have the same true 0.52",
    "kev flux of @xmath31  erg  @xmath29  s@xmath32 , and the count - rates were simulated with zero statistical error , so that any differences in the photometry from the 3 passbands are systematic differences related to the shapes of of the passbands .    in x - ray astronomy , photometry",
    "is normally derived from imaging surveys by measuring the count rate in a given band , and dividing this by an `` energy conversion factor '' ( ecf ) which is specific to the instrument and band to obtain a flux in physical units .",
    "we have followed this process in simulating the photometry that would be obtained through the different passbands .",
    "the ecf itself is typically derived by folding a simulated source of known flux and spectral shape through the response of the instrument following the same procedure as we are employing to obtain the count rates for our simulated sources . to generate ecfs for the three passbands ,",
    "we adopt the spectral model used for the 3xmm catalogue , a power law of photon index @xmath33 absorbed by cold gas with a column density @xmath34  @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the ecfs for the pspc , epic - pn and the synthesized band are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ergs@xmath32  @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the results of the simulated photometry are given in table  [ tab : simulations ] .",
    "it can be seen that the flux derived from the pspc differs significantly for several spectral models from the flux derived from photometry in the natural epic - pn 0.52  kev band . in the worst case of the heavily absorbed spectrum ,",
    "the flux differs by 25 per cent .",
    "in contrast , the flux derived from the synthesized band differs from the pspc flux by less than 1 per cent for all spectral models except for the strongly absorbed spectrum . in that case",
    "the difference is only 4 per cent , and is due to the weak tail towards higher energy in the synthesized response , where the absorbed spectrum is rising rapidly .",
    "i have outlined a method for synthesizing photometric passbands in x - ray astronomy .",
    "it offers the potential to standardize photometry from different x - ray astronomy instruments and missions .",
    "i have limited this letter to a conceptual description of the approach , and provided an example to illustrate how it might be used .",
    "widespread , practical application of the method will require considerably more work .",
    "software tools will be required to optimize the shapes of the synthetic filters @xmath23 used to shape the passbands , and software tools will be needed to compute photometry for real astronomical sources in the synthetic passbands .",
    "not least , for this method to facilitate the large - scale provision of photometry in standardized x - ray passbands , there will need to be concordance within the x - ray astronomy community , at least amongst the curators of archives and the constructors of astronomical catalogues , as to what to choose as the minimum set of standard passbands .",
