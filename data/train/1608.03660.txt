    "@xcite ( hereafter g16 ) presented an extension to the sham model , dubbed as scam ( subhalo clustering and abundance matching ) , which allows central and satellite galaxies to have different galaxy - halo relations and matches ( fitting ) both galaxy abundance and clustering . by comparing the modeling results for galaxy projected and redshift - space 2pcfs with the hod , sham , and scam model , g16 concluded that the hod and scam models generally produce better fits to the observed galaxy 2pcfs than the sham model , with the hod model having slightly lower @xmath4 values",
    "the main difference between the hod and scam models lie in the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies inside halos .",

    "we directly use the bestfit hod and scam models from g16 that jointly fits both the projected and redshift - space 2pcfs to calculate the redshift - space 3pcf and compare with the observation . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , we briefly describe the galaxy sample , the 3pcf measurements , and the modelling of the 3pcf .",
    "we present the modelling results in section  [ sec : results ] and conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    ".samples of different luminosity thresholds [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     generally , the hod and scam models show different predictions of the 3pcfs on both small and intermediate scales . for the most luminous galaxy sample of @xmath5 , all the three models provide reasonable fits to the data , with @xmath6 varying from 0.80 to 1.09 .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : zeta ] , except for the smallest scale ( top - left panel ) , the three model predictions for this sample are comparable to each other . for the two fainter galaxy samples ,",
    "the hod model has much smaller @xmath4 values than the two scam models .",
    "the overall trend is similar to the 2pcf case  for luminous samples ( with luminosity threshold above @xmath0 ) all three models are reasonable , while for faint samples ( with luminosity threshold below @xmath0 ) hod model shows better performances .",
    "we note that the @xmath7 ranges of the expected @xmath4 distribution for the 3pcfs of the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 samples are approximately @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively . for faint samples ,",
    "the differences in the @xmath4 values of the three models are much more significant with the 3pcfs than those with the 2pcfs , implying that 3pcfs can help further discriminate different models .    .",
    "from left to right and bottom to top , the normalized covariance matrix is shown for the six @xmath14 bins from small to large scales , as labeled in fig .  [",
    "fig : zeta].,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    figure  [ fig : zeta ] suggests that the discrimination power has a large contribution from small scale 3pcfs .",
    "this is further supported by the structure in the covariance matrix .",
    "figure  [ fig : cov3pcf ] shows the normalized covariance matrix of the 3pcf measurements for the @xmath15 sample . on large scales ( @xmath16 ) , there is strong correlation between the different @xmath17 bins at each @xmath14 bin . on small scales ,",
    "the correlation is approximately between @xmath17 and @xmath18 bins .",
    "this is in the fingers - of - god regime , and such a correlation is expected from one - halo galaxy triplets ( see below ) . on scales of @xmath19 , the measurements in different @xmath14 bins",
    "are also strongly correlated with each other ( much stronger than those seen for the luminous sample in @xcite ) .",
    "the differences among the different model predictions on large scales ( being mainly an amplitude shift ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : zeta ] ) therefore do not contribute significantly to the differences in the @xmath4 values .    to further investigate the constraining power of the 3pcfs from different scales ,",
    "we perform a test with the @xmath15 sample by removing the 3pcf measurements in a @xmath14 bin at a time and compare the resulting @xmath6 .",
    "we find that for all three models , the resulting @xmath6 is largest when the 3pcf measurements from the smallest @xmath14 bin ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) are dropped .",
    "the small - scale 3pcfs of this sample provides the most discrimination power , consistent with the finding of @xcite .",
    "the hod sample clearly shows a better fit to the small - scale data , which leads to the corresponding smallest @xmath4 value ( 15.1 ) .",
    "even though the @xmath22 model prediction agrees better ( by eye ) with the data points on large scales , it does not fit the smallest scale ( @xmath23 ) data and the overall @xmath4 ( 48.5 ) is much larger .    for the @xmath8 sample ,",
    "the hod model also has the smallest @xmath4 value .",
    "the covariance matrix for the @xmath8 sample is similar to that of the @xmath15 sample with strong correlations shown on all scales .",
    "the small volume of the @xmath8 sample leads to a noisy covariance matrix using the jackknife method , with 46 eigenmodes dropped from the svd analysis , which reduces the constraining power of its 3pcf .",
    "the three models determined from fitting the projected and redshift - space 2pcfs show differences in the redshift - space 3pcf predictions , suggesting that 3pcfs can help further constrain models . to quantify the improvements in model constraints by adding the 3pcfs",
    ", one needs to perform a joint fit to both 2pcfs and 3pcfs . in general , the bestfit model from the joint modeling will shift with respect to the 2pcf - determined model , and the relative contributions from the 2pcfs and 3pcfs will be different from what we have in this paper . while there are accurate and efficient methods to obtain model predictions for the 2pcfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an accurate and efficient method for predicting the model 3pcfs is demanding .",
    "we therefore focus on models that reproduce the 2pcfs and investigate their performances for the 3pcfs to gain some general insights .",
    "there are efforts to perform joint modeling with 3pcfs calculated based on mock catalogs .",
    "for example , @xcite jointly model the 2pcfs and 3pcfs of @xmath24 luminous red galaxies in the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey @xcite .",

    "the implications from the study with the 2pcf - determined models here qualitatively agree with their results based on the joint 2pcf and 3pcf modeling .",
    "the mock catalogs created in this work not only allow us to measure the model predictions but also enable us to decompose the model 3pcfs into various components . in what follows , we use the @xmath15 sample as an example to show the differences in the 3pcf components from different models , which can enhance our understanding of the models .     in fig",

    "the total 3pcf is decomposed into the contributions of one - halo , two - halo , and three - halo components ( denoted as ` 1h ' , ` 2h ' and ` 3h ' , respectively ) .",
    "the different halo components are further divided into contributions of galaxy triplets formed by different combinations of central ( denoted as ` c ' in the figure ) and satellite ( denoted as ` s ' ) galaxies , as labeled . on small scales",
    "( a few tenth @xmath27 ) , the one - halo term has a large contribution , as expected .",
    "in particular , it dominates the signal for degenerate triangle configurations ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) , which results from the triplets elongated along the line of sight caused by the non - linear redshift - space distortion ( the fingers - of - god effect ) . on large scales",
    "( a few @xmath27 ) , the three - halo term ( especially from central - central - central triplets ) dominates , with two - halo components involving central galaxies contributing substantially .",
    "the decompositions of the two scam models ( @xmath30 and @xmath22 ) models have similar trends as for the hod model . however , the three models are different in details . in figure",
    "[ fig : decomp_diff ] , we compare the decompositions of the three models on small ( @xmath31 ) and large ( @xmath32 ) scales . on scales of @xmath33 ,",
    "the hod model agrees with the data better ( fig .  [ fig : zeta ] ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : decomp_diff ] , it is clear that the differences in the models are mainly caused by the one - halo term .",
    "the hod model has significantly larger contributions from the one - halo satellite - satellite - satellite triplets ( ` 1h s - s - s ' ) , while such triplet contributions in the two scam models are less substantial ( lower than the hod model by a factor of about two ) .",
    "as shown in figures  14 and 15 of g16 , in the scam models , satellite galaxies tend to populate slightly less massive halos and move faster ( higher satellite velocity bias ) than in the hod model .",
    "even though the scam models have a higher satellite fraction , the fast motion of satellites dilutes the amount of small - scale galaxy triplets , reducing the one - halo ` c - s - s ' and ` s - s - s ' triplets .",
    "we note that even at such small scales , the two - halo and three - halo terms still have significant contributions .",
    "this is a consequence of the redshift - space distortion effects that change the line - of - sight distribution of galaxies in redshift - space ( see fig .  2 of @xcite for the case of the 2pcf , where the two - halo terms still have significant contributions to the small - scale fingers - of - god feature ) .",
    "on large scales , the hod model seems to agree with the @xmath30 model quite well .",
    "figure  [ fig : decomp_diff ] shows that the dominant contributions , the three - halo ` c - c - c ' and ` c - c - s ' triplets , have similar 3pcf amplitudes for the two models .",
    "there are differences in other components , e.g. , in the hod model higher contributions from the ` 1h c - s - s ' , ` 1h s - s - s ' , ` 2h c - s - s ' , and ` 2h s - s - s ' components and smaller contributions from the ` 3h c - s - s ' and ` 3h s - s - s ' terms .",
    "the central galaxy occupation functions for these two models are quite similar ( g16 ) , as they are well constrained by the sample number density and the large - scale galaxy bias @xcite .",
    "the above subtle differences mainly originate from the different satellite galaxy occupation functions and satellite velocity bias .",
    "these differences are trivial , as their contribution to the total 3pcfs is insignificant .    comparing the different components of the @xmath30 and @xmath22 models , the @xmath22 model usually has higher amplitudes on scales of @xmath34 . for smaller scales ,",
    "the @xmath22 model is only slightly lower for the two one - halo components of ` 1h c - s - s ' and ` 1h s - s - s ' , and much larger for other components .",
    "this is consistent with what we find in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta ] and table  [ tab : chi2 ] , where the @xmath22 model generally has a higher 3pcf amplitude than the @xmath30 model .",
    "the decomposition also demonstrates that the shape dependence ( i.e. , dependence on @xmath17 ) of the 3pcf varies in the different components .",
    "the one - halo terms show the strongest dependence .",
    "the nonlinear redshift - space distortion ( fingers - of - god effect ) makes the distribution of galaxies inside halos appear to be elongated along the line of sight , favoring triplets close to degenerate triangles ( @xmath35 or @xmath29 ) .",
    "the strong shape dependence of the one - halo terms dominates on small scales , but plays almost no role on large - scale 3pcfs , as their contribution to the total 3pcf diminishes .",
    "the large - scale shape dependence comes from the three - halo terms , reflecting the filamentary structure on linear or weakly nonlinear scales from gravitational evolution @xcite .",
    "the radial distributions of the satellite galaxies in the hod and scam models are different ( g16 ) , with the hod model having a steeper satellite distribution .",
    "this difference ( as well as the mean occupation function of satellites ) contributes to the difference in the small - scale 3pcfs from the three models .",
    "the shape of the halo , defined by the satellite galaxies , can be another factor , as the relative mass scale shift among the three models corresponds to halo shape change .",
    "however , as already discussed , the shape dependence of the small - scale 3pcf mainly results from redshift - space distortion , the ( real - space ) shape of halos is not expected to play a big role . to test this",
    ", we compare the halo shape in the hod and scam models . given that halos can be well described by triaxial ellipsoids @xcite",
    ", we follow the method laid out in @xcite to compute the eigenvectors of the reduced inertial tensor for the triaxial ellipsoids traced by satellite galaxies in the three models , and the directions of the eigenvectors define the three principal halo axes . we perform the calculation for all the halos with three or more satellites in the three models .    figure  [ fig : shape ] shows the probability distributions of the two axis ratios of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the three models , assuming the lengths of the semi - principal axes of @xmath38 .",
    "the overall distributions of the axis ratios in the three models are quite similar .",
    "the average axis ratios in all three models are around @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the probability distributions of the axis ratios roughly keep the same even if we consider the satellite galaxy distributions within different distances to the halo centers .",
    "while the overall halo shape distribution marginalized over the full model parameter spaces could be different for the case shown here , the comparison made in figure  [ fig : shape ] is to check the effect of the halo shape on the bestfit models shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : zeta ] .",
    "the comparison implies that the differences seen in the model predictions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta ] ) are the result of the differences in the radial distribution , the mean occupation function , and the velocity bias of satellite galaxies , rather than the shape distribution of satellite galaxies . in addition , given the large role played by the small - scale redshift - space distortion in the shape dependence of the small - scale 3pcfs , it is unlikely that the intrinsic halo shape ( defined by the satellite distribution ) can be well constrained by the redshift - space 3pcfs .",
    "in this paper , we present the luminosity - dependent redshift - space galaxy 3pcf measurements for the sdss dr7 main galaxy sample .",
    "the measurements are then used to test three models , the hod model and two scam models ( based on @xmath30 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "these models are obtained by fitting the projected and redshift - space galaxy 2pcfs ( g16 ) , and the 3pcf predictions come from mock catalogs .    for the most luminous galaxy sample ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the predictions from all the three models agree well with the 3pcf measurements . for the fainter samples ( @xmath15 and @xmath8 ) , the prediction from the hod model generally provides a better match to the measurements .",
    "this strengthens the trend seen in modeling galaxy 2pcfs ( g16 )  all models work reasonably well for samples with luminosity threshold above @xmath0 , while the hod model stands out in better fitting faint samples ( with luminosity threshold below @xmath0 ) .",
    "we decompose the total 3pcfs into contributions from different types of galaxy triplets . on small scales ,",
    "the 3pcfs are dominated by contributions from one - halo galaxy triplets , and the dependence on the triangle shape is driven by the redshift - space distortion ( the fingers - of - god effect ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the 3pcfs in projected space have a much weaker shape dependence than those in redshift space , as found by @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic halo shape defined by the distribution of satellites , however , does not contribute much to the shape dependence of the 3pcfs , as the halo shape in redshift space is largely determined by the motion of satellites . on large scales , the 3pcfs are dominated by contributions from three - halo galaxy triplets , and the shape dependence reflects the filamentary structure from gravitational evolution .",
    "the small - scale 3pcfs , where the three model predictions more strongly deviate from each other ( in both 3pcf amplitude and shape ) , are related to the radial distribution , the mean occupation function , and the velocity bias of satellite galaxies , so we expect that the small - scale 3pcfs can further constrain the above galaxy - halo connection and distinguish different models .    in conclusion , besides the traditional application of the galaxy 3pcf to measure the nonlinear galaxy bias ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the additional information encoded in the 3pcf can be used to distinguish the various halo ( and subhalo ) models , as well as tighten the constraints on the occupation distribution of galaxies inside halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
