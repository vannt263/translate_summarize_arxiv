    "the formation of dark matter halos plays a central role in the studies of galaxy formation as well as of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "a widely used analytical theory for the formation of halos is the extended press - schechter ( ps thereafter ) formalism @xcite , which can be used to model the mass function of dark halos @xcite , the bias parameter as a function of halo mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mw96 ) , as well as the formation histories of dark halos @xcite . in the simplest excursion - set model of @xcite ,",
    "the physical properties of dark halos are expected to depend only on halo mass , but not on large - scale environments .",
    "however , it has been known for almost a decade that neither the ps mass function nor the mw96 bias model matches well @xmath5-body results for halo masses @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is defined such that the rms linear density fluctuation within a sphere of mass @xmath2 is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed an ellipsoid collapse model to replace the spherical collapse model in the ps theory , and found a better agreement between the theory and @xmath5-body simulations in both the mass function and the bias function .",
    "earlier investigations with cosmological @xmath5-body simulations did not find any strong environmental dependence of halo properties , such as the spin parameter , concentration and formation time @xcite .",
    "however , the poor resolutions and small dynamical ranges covered in these simulations make it difficult to detect any signals that are relatively weak or outside the dynamical range , and so a significant age - dependence of halo clustering can not be ruled out",
    ". note also that there were earlier attempts to develop empirical models for the age - dependence of halo clustering @xcite .    with the use of a very large @xmath5-body simulation",
    ", @xcite recently demonstrated convincingly that the clustering strength of dark halos does depend on halo formation time .",
    "in particular , they found that this dependence is strong only for halos with @xmath8 and becomes very weak for @xmath9 .",
    "this also explains why @xcite could not detect an age dependence , because they focused on halos with @xmath9 at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite have examined the physical process that may be responsible for the age dependence of halo clustering .",
    "they found that halos embedded in dense environments accrete mass less efficiently than the spherical collapse model predicts , because the matter to be accreted is ` heated ' by the large - scale structure ( like the pancake heating considered in , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this explains why the old population of small halos has a higher bias than the young population of the same mass .",
    "it also qualitatively explains why the ps mass function and bias functions deviate from @xmath5-body simulations at small masses .",
    "it is well known that the concentration parameter of halos at a given mass , @xmath10 , has a broad log - normal distribution , and is correlated with the halo formation epoch @xmath11 in such a way that halos of earlier formation have a higher concentration @xcite .",
    "therefore the age dependence of halo bias should yield a concentration dependence of halo bias .",
    "such dependence is indeed observed in recent @xmath5-body simulations .",
    "@xcite found that , for masses @xmath12 , halos with higher concentrations are more strongly clustered , as expected from the age dependence and the correlation between the age and concentration of dark halos .",
    "more interestingly , @xcite found reversed concentration dependence for @xmath9 , in the sense that halos with higher concentrations are actually less biased .",
    "this result was not seen by @xcite who explored the age dependence only for @xmath13 .",
    "more recently , @xcite examined both the age dependence and concentration dependence of halo clustering for massive halos .",
    "while they found concentration dependence similar to that found by @xcite , they did not detect any significant dependence on formation epoch .",
    "note , however , that @xcite used halos identified at different redshifts to increase the dynamical range probed by their simulations , while both @xcite and @xcite used halos identified at the same time .",
    "it is unclear how to make a detailed comparison between the different results .",
    "the environmental dependence of halo formation and structure has important implications not only for improving the ps theory but also for improving semi - analytical models of galaxy formation based on ps merger trees and current halo occupation distribution ( hod ) models . in this _ letter _ , we use a large set of cosmological simulations , each with @xmath14 particles , to investigate in detail the concentration and formation epoch dependence of halo clustering .",
    "the model considered here is a canonical spatially - flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with the density parameter @xmath15 , the cosmological constant @xmath16 , the hubble constant @xmath17 , and the baryon density parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the primordial density field is assumed to be gaussian with a scale - invariant power spectrum @xmath19 .",
    "for the linear spectrum , we adopt the fitting transfer function of @xcite , and the normalization is set by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the present linear rms density fluctuation within a sphere of radius @xmath22 .",
    "we use an upgraded version of the particle - particle - particle - mesh ( @xmath23 ) code of @xcite to simulate structure formation in the universe .",
    "the code has now incorporated the multiple level @xmath23 gravity solver for high density regions @xcite . in order to have a large mass resolution range , we run a total of 7 simulations with @xmath14 particles in different simulation boxes ( table [ tab : simu ] ) .",
    "the simulations were run on an sgi altix 350 with 16 processors with openmp parallelization in shanghai astronomical observatory .",
    "we have 4 realizations with boxsize @xmath24 in order to reliably measure the bias of the most massive halos , which is the focus of the present _",
    "letter_.    dark matter halos are identified using the standard friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length @xmath25 equal to @xmath26 times the mean particle separation .",
    "unbound particles ( with positive binding energy ) are excluded .",
    "we use halos containing 100 particles or more , and our analysis covers halos with masses ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "once the number density field of dark matter halos , @xmath29 , and the density field of dark matter @xmath30 , are given , the conventional way to estimate the halo bias factor @xmath25 is to use the definition , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the two - point correlation function of dark halos , and @xmath33 that of dark matter .",
    "here we adopt a slightly different approach by using the cross power spectrum of @xcite .",
    "we first fourier transform both @xmath29 and @xmath30 into @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and then measure the bias factor through @xmath36 as shown by @xcite , this method suppresses poisson noise due to a limited number of dark halos more effectively than the correlation method , because the number of dark particles is in general much larger than that of dark halos .",
    "this is particularly important for the present study , as we need to accurately determine the bias for massive halos whose number density is low .",
    "we have estimated the bias factors for the four realizations of the @xmath37 box simulations , using both the correlation method and the cross power spectrum method .",
    "the average values of the bias over the four realizations obtained with the two methods are consistent , but the scatter with the correlation method is about a factor of 2 larger than that with the cross power spectrum . the cross power spectrum method is therefore preferred .",
    "errors on @xmath38 are estimated following @xcite : ten random samples are generated for each simulated halo sample , and the scatter of @xmath38 among them is used as the error in @xmath38 for the real sample .",
    "we have compared the error so obtained with that estimated from the scatter among the 4 realizations of the @xmath24 box simulation .",
    "the errors given by the two methods are comparable .",
    "our analysis focuses on the halo populations at the present time , @xmath39 .",
    "halos are divided into mass bins ( specified by @xmath40 $ ] with @xmath41 ) according to their masses . for each mass bin , we sort the halos into 5 populations according to formation redshift , @xmath42 , which is defined as the redshift at which the mass of the most massive progenitor of a halo is equal to half of its mass .",
    "although analysis was carried out for all the five populations , here we present the results only for the 20% youngest halos with the smallest @xmath42 and for the 20% oldest ones with the largest @xmath42 . in what follows , these two populations are simply referred to as the young and the old populations , respectively . to ensure that the bias obtained here",
    "is in the linear regime , we only consider fourier modes with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a wavenumber at which the variance @xmath45 . figure [ fig : fig1 ] plots examples of the bias factor for massive halos with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , in the @xmath24 box simulations .",
    "the top - left panel shows the results for the young population , while the top - right panel shows the same measurement for the old population .",
    "the results clearly show that the bias factors are nearly scale independent in the linear regime .",
    "the solid line in each panel is the mean value obtained by a least square fit to the data points at @xmath43 .",
    "the bias factor for the young population is about 10% higher than that for old population .",
    "we present the mean bias factor @xmath49 as a function of mass obtained from different simulations in the top panel of figure [ fig : fig2 ] . for a given halo mass ,",
    "the measurement of @xmath49 is more accurate in a simulation of a larger volume .",
    "therefore we plot the data points for each simulation only up to a halo mass which corresponds to 100 particles in the next larger simulation , except for the @xmath37 box simulation , where we plot all the data points available .",
    "note that the bias factors obtained from different simulations agree extremely well with each other , and so the set of simulations used here allows us to explore the age dependence of halo bias over four orders of magnitude in halo mass . for @xmath50 , the old population ( red symbols )",
    "is more strongly biased ( has stronger clustering ) than the young population ( blue symbols ) , which is in a good quantitative agreement with the results obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cyan lines ) . with the millennium simulation with a boxsize of @xmath51",
    ", @xcite was not able to explore accurately the age dependence of halo clustering for higher halo mass .",
    "our results clearly show that the difference between the old and young populations decreases with increasing halo mass up to @xmath52 , at which the young population starts to surpass the old population in the bias factor . for @xmath53 , the bias factor for the young population",
    "is about @xmath54 higher than that of the old population , with weak dependence on halo mass .",
    "although the difference in the bias factor between the old and young populations is small at the high mass end , it is detected at a high statistical confidence ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the concentration of each halo is obtained following the fitting method of @xcite .",
    "the density distribution within each halo is fitted with a nfw profile to obtain the scale radius @xmath56 , and the concentration is defined as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the virial radius within which the mean density is 361 times the mean density of the universe . here only halos with 320 particles or more are used , because the concentration may not be measured accurately for halos containing smaller number of particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the lower two panels of figure [ fig : fig1 ] show the bias factor as a function of wavenumber for massive halos with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "results for the least concentrated 20% are plotted in the lower left panel , while those for the most concentrated 20% are in the lower right panel . here",
    "again , the bias factor is almost scale - independent .",
    "the amplitude of the bias factor for massive halos clearly depends on concentration , with halos with higher concentration less strongly biased . to see how the concentration - dependence changes with halo mass , we plot in the lower panel of figure [ fig : fig2 ] the bias factor for the most concentraed 20% and the least concentrated 20% of the halos in each of the mass bins .",
    "note that there is good agreement between simulations with different box sizes , suggesting that 320 particles may be sufficient to sample the concentration for the purpose of the present paper.our results show clearly that the more concentrated halos have a larger bias for @xmath3 , but the trend is reversed for @xmath59 , in qualitative agreement with the results in @xcite .    comparing the results here with the dependence on the formation epoch ( the upper panel ) , we see that the concentration dependence is weaker than the age dependence for @xmath3 , but stronger for @xmath60 . the difference in the bias factor between the most concentrated 20% and the least concentrated",
    "20% is about 25% for @xmath61 - @xmath62 , larger than the 10% between the youngest 20% and oldest 20% .",
    "this may be why concentration dependence was but age dependence was not found for halos with @xmath59 in previous investigations @xcite .",
    "our results also show that the concentration dependence reverses almost exactly at @xmath63 , while the reversal of age dependence occurs at a much larger mass , @xmath64 .",
    "finally , the concentration dependence does not seem to become stronger with increasing mass for @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , the difference in the bias factor between the most concentrated 20% and the least concentrated 20% is only about 10% at @xmath65 .",
    "so far we have used a finite mass bin @xmath66 $ ] with @xmath67 to study the age and concentration dependence of the bias for halos of a given mass . since",
    "more massive halos on average have younger ages and smaller concentration , and since the bias factor increases strongly with halo mass at the high mass end , the use of a finite mass bin to represent a givn mass may artificially introduce age and concentration dependence . to check thie effect ,",
    "we repeat our analysis using narrower mass bins with @xmath68 .",
    "the results are plotted as the solid and dashed lines in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the results are almost indistinguishable from those obtained with @xmath67 , demonstrating that the mass bins we used is sufficiently small .",
    "our major findings in this paper can be summarized as follows :    ( i ) : :    the younger halo population is significantly less clustered than the    old one for @xmath69 ; ( ii ) : :    for @xmath70 , the age dependence is reversed , and the    bias factor of the youngest 20% of the halos with a given mass is    approximately 10% _ higher _ than that of the oldest 20% of the same    mass ; ( iii ) : :    when the halos are divided into subsamples according to concentration    parameter , the halo bias is larger ( smaller ) for halos with higher    concentrations for @xmath12 ( @xmath9 ) .    the first result is a confirmation of the result of @xcite with the use of a much larger data set and a different clustering measure ( our cross power spectrum versus their auto - correlation function ) .",
    "our use of a large set of simulations in large boxes enables us to quantify , for the first time , the age dependence of halo bias for @xmath71 .",
    "the weak age dependence for massive halos relative to low - mass halos ones may reflect the fact that these halos have a narrower distribution in formation time ( see fig.1 of * ? ? ? * ) , but the opposite trend , although weak , is not easy to explain .",
    "the third result is qualitatively in agreement with @xcite .",
    "however , their results are based on halos identified at different times , while ours are based on halos identified at the same tme as it should be .",
    "our results also show that the concentration dependence is weaker than the age dependence for @xmath3 but stronger for @xmath72 .",
    "there is also indication that both the age and concentration dependence becomes weaker at the very massive end .",
    "the difference in the age and concentration dependence implies that caution must be taken in comparing model predictions with observational results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since it is unclear whether the formation epoch , as defined by @xmath42 , or concentration , or even some other properties of a halo is more important in determining the properties of the galaxies that form in it .",
    "the dependence of halo bias on formation epoch and concentration implies that the simple excursion set theory of halo formation @xcite is not accurate . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the problem with the simple excursion set theory is that spherical collapse model , which neglects large - scale tidal field , over - predicts the collapse of small halos ( @xmath73 ) in high density environments .",
    "they argue , however , that this dynamical effect should be smaller for large halos ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "it is possible that the large - scale tidal field also plays a role in the formation of massive halos .",
    "but instead of truncating mass accretion , as is for the case of low - mass halos , the large - scale tidal field may delay the accretion , enhancing the accretion at later times .",
    "this possibility should be checked further by examining in detail the accretion histories and environments of massive halos in simulations .",
    "the extended ps theory @xcite has been implemented in a variety of cosmological studies with clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the present results for massive halos point to a limitation of the theory in such applications , and indeed should prompt the exploration of an improved theoretical framework in the future .",
