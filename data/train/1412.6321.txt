    "cm and qm are theories belonging to different dynamical hierarchies .",
    "another example of such a hierarchy is observed in dynamics of fluids , where macroscopic behaviors of its constituent particles can be described by a coarse - grained dynamics called hydrodynamics .",
    "however , particles which have much larger scales are suspended in a fluid , we need to solve coupled equations of the particles and the fluid @xcite .",
    "this is an example of the appearance of a hybrid dynamics of different hierarchies .",
    "then it is interesting to ask whether we can construct an effective hybrid dynamics when quantum and classical degrees of freedom coexist .",
    "in fact , there are several situations where such quantum - classical hybrids ( qch ) seem to show up : quantum measurement @xcite , quantum - to - classical transition in early universe @xcite , einstein gravity interacting with quantum objects @xcite , berry s phase @xcite and so on .",
    "moreover , qch has been studied to simplify complex numerical simulations in quantum chemistry @xcite .",

    "@xcite and the references therein .",
    "there are already many models of qch , but still no established theory .",
    "the successful theories are constructed so as to combine quantum and classical systems consistently @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study this problem from a different perspective . we first prepare a quantum system and derive a model of qch by employing  _ classicalization _ \" , which is a systematic method to replace quantum degrees of freedom with classical variables @xcite .",
    "our classicalization is based on the hypothetical view that quantization can be formulated in the form of a variational principle by using the stochastic variational method ( svm ) , which was proposed by yasue @xcite so as to reformulate nelson s stochastic quantization @xcite . as a pedagogical introduction of this approach ,",
    "see ref .",

    "let us consider a non - relativistic two - particle system with the masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and an interaction potential @xmath2 .",
    "newton s equation of motion of this system is given by optimizing the action defined by @xmath3 with @xmath4 being a kinetic term .",
    "yasue showed that the schrdinger equation is derived by employing svm to this classical action , replacing particle trajectories with stochastic variables .",
    "the stochastic trajectories of the two particles @xmath5 and @xmath6 are characterized by the stochastic differential equations ( i=1,2 ) , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent wiener processes .",

    "to quantize this classical system , we obtain the corresponding stochastic lagrangian by substituting @xmath15 as @xmath16 here , two different time derivatives , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are introduced , because stochastic trajectories have zig - zag forms and the classical definition of velocity is not applicable . as was discussed by nelson @xcite , the mean forward derivative @xmath17 and the mean backward derivative @xmath18 are defined by @xmath19 , \\\\",

    "the framework of svm itself is more than the method of quantization and various applications are found in , for example , ref .",
    "let us derive a model of qch under the assumption that the particle 1 is approximately described as a classical particle for a certain initial condition .",
    "then we need to _ classicalize _ the degree of freedom of the particle 1 .",
    "as we have seen , the origin of quantum fluctuation is attributed to the fluctuation of @xmath15 induced by the wiener process in svm .",

    "( [ fsde ] ) , we employ the following equation only for the particle 1 as the procedure of the classicalization , @xmath45 here @xmath46 takes positive and negative values .",

    "remember that the noise intensity is proportional to the inverse of the mass of particles and thus the above approximation will be justified for heavier particles . of course , the applicability of the classicalization depends also on initial conditions .",
    "a more precise criterion of this applicability will be discussed later .",
    "this modification of the definition drastically changes the result of the variation .",
