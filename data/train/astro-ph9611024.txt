    "the final fate of the cooling gas seen by x  ray telescopes in clusters of galaxies has long been sought and any system which can provide evidence for star formation arising in a system of cooling gas is of great interest . the cd galaxy in abell 1795 ( @xmath4 ) has been an object of much study since it was identified with the radio source 4c 26.42 ( @xcite ) and later found to reside in a cluster cooling flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent optical studies ( @xcite ) found it to possess extended nuclear emission ",
    "line gas ( @xmath5kpc , @xmath6 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies in both the ultraviolet and optical reveal an unusual blue continuum ( @xcite ) whose structure has been recently traced in broad band optical imaging ( @xcite ) .",
    "these properties have made it one of the best candidate galaxies for exhibiting star formation arising from a cluster cooling flow though other mechanisms can be invoked to explain the radio emission and emission  line gas .",
    "hubble space telescope observations , improved ccd sensitivity at blue wavelengths and the ultraviolet telescopes on board the astro space shuttle payload have made this galaxy an object of renewed interest ( @xcite ) .",
    "these recent observations have revealed regions with colors bluer than normal ( @xmath7;@xcite ) for an expected old stellar population , near the galaxy nucleus that may be the sites of recent star formation .",
    "these blue regions are confined to the very central ( @xmath8 ) region of the galaxy .",
    "the cd appearance at long wavelengths ( @xmath9 ) where the light is dominated by the oldest stars is smooth and does not suggest that a recent globally disturbing event ( e.g. a major galaxy interaction ) has occurred to trigger a burst of central star formation .",
    "suggested possible triggers for the star formation have included radio jets , collision with a smaller galaxy ( @xcite ) , and the interaction of the gas cooling out of the x  ray halo with the galaxy interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "each of these interpretations predict some recent star formation in the galaxy nucleus , but with potentially differing morphologies , resultant population mixes and emission  line properties .",
    "if the galaxy has undergone recent star formation then it is natural to turn to the ultraviolet ( uv ) part of the spectrum for observational confirmation .",
    "young stars will most easily be distinguished from the preexisting stellar population by observations shortward of the 4000 break .",
    "in particular , observations by the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) in its far  uv filter may be used as a valuable diagnostic for stars which are extremely hot ( @xmath10k ) . at the distance of cd ( @xmath4 ) as few as",
    "1200 o stars would be detectable with uit ( provided there was no obscuration by dust ) . at the wavelengths observed by the uit all of the underlying old population ( primarily g , k and later type stars ) will be invisible , with the important possible exception of extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars ( @xcite ) .    in section  [ sec : data ]",
    "we discuss the uit data and photometry as well as archival data used in the analyses .",
    "we follow in section  [ sec : summary ] with a discussion of the implications these new uv data have for star formation properties in abell 1795 .",
    "we present our image obtained with the uit during the astro2 space shuttle mission of march 1995 in figure  [ fig : cluster ] .",
    "the uit took several exposures using a far  uv filter with @xmath11=1520 ; @xmath12 ( which we shall hereafter denote by the first two digits of its central wavelength ) .",
    "for this study we used only the deepest ( 1310.5 sec ) exposure . for a complete description of the instrument and preliminary data reduction steps involved",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the uit has a large field of view ( 40diameter ) so the entire cluster core was imaged , but little beyond the cd itself was detected .",
    "the nominal stellar point ",
    "spread function ( psf ) for the uit has a fwhm of @xmath13 , but the abell 1795 images have poorer resolution with fwhm of the stellar psf of @xmath14 .",
    "several factors can contribute to decreased resolution with the most common being crew motions onboard the shuttle during the observation . in section",
    "[ sec : others ] we briefly discuss objects other than the cd in the uit image .",
    "we have also assembled a collection of archival data to complement our uit observations of this cluster .",
    "these additional data , when combined with that from uit create a unique , long wavelength lever arm with which to examine the star formation properties .",
    "we extracted two pipeline calibrated image data sets , taken with the f555w ( hst `` v '' ) and f702w filters , from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) archives ( u2630401 - 6 ) . after correcting the image headers for updated wfpc2 astrometry ( j. hu , private communication ) we removed the cosmic rays and applied a charge transfer correction as outlined in @xcite and combined the two longest exposure images ( 800 sec each ) . since the portion of the cd galaxy seen by the uit is the central @xmath15 we used only that portion of the hst data ( pc chip ) .",
    "no sky subtraction was performed on the hst images because the short exposure times ( 800 sec ) combined with small pixel size imply that there is little if any contribution to the f555w and f702w signal from a background .",
    "b. mcnamara kindly provided us with a copy of his calibrated @xmath16band image obtained with the kitt peak national observatory s 2.1 m telescope ( @xcite ) . for comparing the global stellar population with that of the electrons responsible for the radio emission we acquired a copy of previously published vla data from j.p .",
    "ge ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the primary goals of the uit was to investigate the changes in galaxy morphology with wavelength for a variety of galaxy types . as part of this effort",
    "we have constructed a series of figures comparing the uit image of the cd galaxy with those from other passbands ( figures  [ fig : uitha ] through [ fig : uitvla ] ) .",
    "these figures show the uit image resembles the h@xmath17 emission more nearly that the broad band optical emission and that the uv morphology has no obvious link to the radio morphology .",
    "the similarity of the uv and h@xmath17 morphologies prompted us to estimate the amount of ly@xmath17 contamination in our uit filter band .",
    "to determine the strength of any ly@xmath17 emission from the center of the galaxy we extracted an archival iue spectrum of the cd galaxy ( @xcite ) and convolved it with the uit filter response curve .",
    "though the system does exhibit moderately strong ly@xmath17 emission ( see  [ sec : photometry ] ) this contributes little to the uit measured flux .",
    "moreover , astro-2 hopkins ultraviolet telescope spectra show those emission  lines that are present in the uit filter are weak and do not contribute substantially to the overall uv flux ( dixon , private communication ) .",
    "thus , despite the superficial resemblance of the uit cd image to the h@xmath17 morphology we conclude that the light is from a continuum source and not extended emission  line gas .",
    "direct comparison of the hst optical and uit uv morphologies is complicated to interpret due to the great difference in resolution .",
    "however , the presence of the dust lane dramatically revealed in the hst data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hstuit ] ) is reflected in the pinching of the uv contours in the uit image . in general , the uv morphology is much less regular than the hst f555w and f702w morphologies .",
    "the blue lobes seen by @xcite may be associated with the north and south peaks of the uv contours separated by @xmath18 , but we do not find these regions to be bluer than the galaxy as a whole ( in 1520-@xmath1915-@xmath20 ) .",
    "the 3.6 cm and 1520 morphologies of the cd galaxy are coaligned roughly north  south ( figure  [ fig : uitvla ] ) .",
    "@xcite found the blue lobes at the ends of the radio emission leading them to posit that the jets may be inducing star formation via interaction with the galaxy ism .",
    "the uv data suggest very weak concentrations in flux near the outer edges of the radio emission .    to further investigate the morphology of the uv light we compare it surface brightness profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) with those at longer wavelengths we generated surface brightness profiles in the uv , f555w and f702w bands using the stsdas ellipse task ( fig . [ fig : rprofile ] ) , and fit a function to the profile in @xcite for the @xmath16 profile .",
    "there is no evidence for a point source component to the uv surface brightness profile .",
    "we fit both elliptical ( @xmath21law ) and disk galaxy ( exponential ) light profiles to the uit data and find that the disk galaxy light profile is a better match . table  [ tab : galfits ] gives the results for our model galaxy profile fits .",
    "we also performed fits to the f702w profile .",
    "the best fit was achieved with a combined point source , exponential disk and @xmath21-law bulge model . however , the disk central surface brightness for this fit is more than 2 magnitudes brighter than the corresponding characteristic bulge surface brightness ( @xmath22 ) indicating that the central region ( @xmath23 ) of the cd has a predominantly disk - like light distribution .",
    "thus both the uv and visual light from the central portion of the galaxy are better characterized by exponential light distributions than by elliptical galaxy light distributions , but with the uv light being more extended ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found spectroscopic evidence for for emission  line gas rotation in the central part of the cd while @xcite found no evidence for a rotating disk , but neither measurements were sensitive to the small spatial scales accessible to hst nor to the young stellar population easily isolated by the uit .",
    "the color index does not vary significantly over the central portion of the cd .",
    "however , the ( 15-@xmath20 ) index does change with the central part being slightly redder than the outer parts .",
    "this is most likely do to the presence of the dust so easily visible in the hst image .",
    "@xcite found that several ellipticals observed with uit generally become bluer with decreasing radius , but none of those galaxies were know to possess significant amounts of centrally concentrated dust .",
    "we performed our photometry using software specifically tailored to uit data , but modeled on the daophot aperture photometry routine .",
    "curve of growth analysis shows that the cd galaxy light ( centered at @xmath2513:48:52.42 , @xmath2626:35:34.7 ) is contained within a circle of radius @xmath27 .",
    "the aperture magnitude and corresponding flux for the galaxy are @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "henceforth , all photometric comparisons will be confined to this region or specific apertures within this radius . using archival iue spectra we are able to estimate the contribution to the uit flux arising from the ly@xmath17 emission in the galaxy",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have corrected the uit magnitudes by @xmath30 to account for this emission  line contribution , yielding @xmath31 .",
    "there was no detectable uv flux associated with the blue filamentary region described by @xcite . to check for the presence of the blue lobes we placed small ( @xmath32 ) apertures on the locations of lobes ( from @xcite figure 6 ) and on the galaxy center .",
    "we find no significant difference between the colors in these various regions .",
    "however , the low spatial resolution of the uit image and typical uncertainty in its photometry ( @xmath33mag ) folded in with stochastic variations of the spatial distribution of o  stars imply that detecting color difference with these images would be difficult .",
    "we photometered the hst and u band data within the same region and list the resulting magnitudes and colors in table  [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "steps outlined in @xcite were taken to calibrate the hst photometry .",
    "for both the u and hst images we digitally removed a small elliptical galaxy at @xmath34 replacing the pixels with those from a region at the same radius , but 180 degrees different in position angle .",
    "the hst magnitudes were corrected for emission ",
    "line contributions using the data from @xcite .",
    "these corrections were small with @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the only emission line in the @xmath16band filter is the [ ] @xmath37 for which we correct by @xmath38 .",
    "the optical magnitudes have been @xmath39corrected using the models from @xcite .",
    "we estimated the @xmath39correction for the 1520 ( @xmath40 ) by convolving a numerically redshifted o star spectrum with the uit filter response and comparing this with its @xmath41 counterpart .",
    "no corrections for galactic extinction have been applied because @xmath42 .",
    "we also photometered a polygonal region ( @xmath43 ) centered on the dust lane visible within the hst image to compare the colors inside and outside this region .",
    "the change in color compared with an identical region centered on the optical nucleus is @xmath44 .",
    "there are 10 previously cataloged objects , excluding the cd galaxy , visible in the uit image .",
    "five of these are cataloged only in the hst guide star catalog ( gsc ) while the other five are sao82997 ( @xmath45 , ( 15-@xmath20)=4.89 , f8v ) , sao83004 ( @xmath46 , ( 15-@xmath20)=4.97 , f0v ) , abell cluster galaxies # 40 and # 151,(@xcite ) and 1345.6 + 2639 ( @xmath47 , ( 15-@xmath20)=0.15 ; a seyfert galaxy )",
    ". the two stars and the seyfert galaxy are all point sources .",
    "there is no previously published photometry for the two cluster galaxies , but we have estimated their colors based upon their digitized palomar sky survey ( dposs ) images .",
    "we find : abell # 40 , @xmath48 , ( 15-@xmath20)=3.0 , abell # 151 , @xmath49 , ( 15-@xmath20)=2.3 . these magnitudes have not been corrected for @xmath39dimming or for extinction ( external or intrinsic ) .",
    "both objects are quite blue for normal cluster galaxies and may be experiencing some star formation . assuming their uv light is due to young stars we estimate that abell # 40 and abell # 151 contain @xmath50 o stars .",
    "this would imply star formation rates of approximately 1 m@xmath51yr@xmath1 we note however that their ( 15-@xmath20 ) colors are similar to those seen in galaxies with `` uv upturns '' arising from hot ehb stars in the old population ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , without other evidence for recent star formation ( h@xmath17 emission for example ) we can not distinguish between young stars and ehb stars as the primary cause for blue colors .",
    "in addition to these sources there are four uncataloged sources ( all are 5@xmath52 detections ) with mean magnitude @xmath53 .",
    "comparison of their positions with the dposs suggest all of these are stars or groups of stars too faint in the visible to be included in the hst gsc .",
    "comparison with deep optical images has proven to be fruitful in identifying faint uit sources ( @xcite ) which are easily overlooked on the poss .",
    "we expect the same may be true for this image as there are several faint ( @xmath54 ) sources without optical counterparts in the dposs .",
    "to estimate the star formation history or current star formation rate using the uv measurements from uit we must first determine the nature of the uv light . if the light arises primarily from emission  line gas then it will tell us little about massive star formation . early iue spectroscopy by @xcite suggested that the uv light was due to high temperature gas , but later iue observations did measure a continuum ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , recent optical spectroscopy has found strong evidence of a hot continuum ( @xcite ) at optical wavelengths .",
    "spectroscopy at all wavelengths reveals line ratios from the emission ",
    "line gas that are inconsistent with ionization via a nuclear , nonthermal power  law source . the liner  like spectrum of abell 1795 is better fit by shock models ( @xcite ) or photoionization by a hot population ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the bulk of the uv emission in the uit bandpass does come from a continuum of hot stars which may in turn be responsible for ionizing some of the emission  line gas .",
    "since at least some portion of the observed h@xmath17 and ly@xmath17 flux arises from gas photoionized by a uv continuum there must be a significant population of young hot stars , implying either a recent episode of star formation ( @xmath55few myr ) or continuous star formation . the uit magnitude listed in table",
    "[ tab : photometry ] implies a luminosity at 1500 , @xmath56 erg sec@xmath1 . we can estimate the number of o5 stars required to produce the measured uit flux and then compare that with the expected star formation rate needed to fuel the h@xmath17 emission . using kurucz model atmospheres ( @xcite ) , assuming and effective temperature and luminosity of 38,000k , @xmath57 for a mid o star , and cosmology with @xmath58 , @xmath59 we require @xmath60 stars to match the uit , @xmath39corrected flux .",
    "this represents the _ minimum _ number of ionizing stars because no extinction correction has been applied and mid o stars produce more ionizing flux than early b stars . without ultraviolet spectroscopic information we can not further restrict the relative contributions of various stellar types with temperatures greater than 15000k to the uit flux . adopting the extinction ( @xmath61 ) from @xcite and assuming a galactic extinction law ( savage and mathis 1979 ) and foreground screen dust model causes the estimated number of o stars to rise to @xmath62 .",
    "recent optical spectroscopy by @xcite predicts @xmath63 o stars ( adjusting to our cosmology ) using similar extinction , suggesting that the screen model may be a reasonable approximation for the dust extinction in the galaxy center .",
    "the implied star formation rate ( sfr ) is in the range @xmath64yr@xmath1 , depending on the imf model , with the lower bounds corresponding to a @xcite imf and the upper bound corresponding to a @xcite imf .",
    "since some of the h@xmath17 emission comes from shocked gas a sfr derived assuming all the emission come from photoionized gas is an upper limit .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the actual sfr is closer to the lower limit in the case of abell 1795 .",
    "this sfr is consistent with the predicted star formation rates one calculates from the h@xmath17 luminosity ( @xmath65yr@xmath1 , @xcite ) .",
    "these star formation rates are substantially lower than those estimated from recent x  ray analyses ( @xmath66yr@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .    to further test the various scenarios for possible star formation histories we use models based upon ( a ) a single , instantaneous burst of star formation ( b ) a single , exponentially decaying burst of star formation ( c ) continuous , constant star formation ( d ) a single , instantaneous old burst with smaller , younger bursts superimposed .",
    "the first three models are described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the fourth model is simply a scaled superposition of the models in ( a ) .",
    "we have plotted color  color diagrams using the four colors ( 15-@xmath67 ) , ( 15-@xmath68 ) , ( @xmath69 ) , ( ) for each set of the above models to compare with the global colors of the cd galaxy ( figure  [ fig : c - cd ] ) .",
    "the colors have been corrected for @xmath39dimming , but not extinction .",
    "extinction vectors based upon various models for the distribution of the dust are added to the plot .",
    "several models for the star formation history can be ruled out .",
    "models with exponentially decaying star formation and those in which the central population was created in a single burst of age greater than @xmath70few hundred myr all have broad - band colors too red to match the cd .",
    "models with some levels of continuous star formation and/or those with recent bursts however can reproduce the colors .",
    "the most plausible burst model is one in which an old galaxy ( @xmath71 ) experiences a salpeter imf burst of age 4myr and total mass @xmath72 of the old population , within the photometered aperture .",
    "we estimated the mass interior to @xmath73 by comparing the fraction of light within this radius for an @xmath74law galaxy with its total and assumed a constant @xmath75 ratio of 20 .",
    "since this likely underestimates the central @xmath75 ratio the mass required of our burst to match the cd colors is an upper limit .",
    "the most plausible continuous , constant star formation model which matched the far uv - visible colors is one inn which the galaxy has been forming stars at a rate @xmath76yr@xmath1 over the past 5 gyr .",
    "the dust lane visible in figure  [ fig : hstuit ] complicates the interpretation of broad  band observations , particularly those involving ultraviolet light . by comparing the measured @xmath77 ly@xmath17 flux to h@xmath17 flux and assuming suitable values for the intrinsic line flux ratio ,",
    "@xcite estimated the intrinsic @xmath78=0.14 , but with a wide possible range ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "recent optical spectroscopy by @xcite suggests @xmath78=0.22 .",
    "the straight line vectors in figure  [ fig : c - cd ] show the effects of dust assuming both the galactic @xcite ( @xmath80 ) and smc extinction laws .",
    "the curved lines ( for a dusty galaxy , similar to a spiral and an elliptical galaxy model ) are the extinction curves based upon the dust / stellar distribution models of @xcite .",
    "their models of mixed dust , gas and stars generally produce smaller extinction in the uv than a simple foreground screen models .",
    "the location of the galaxy in the color  color diagrams is consistent with systems having continuous star formation over the last 5 - 10gyr when combined with the @xmath78=0.14 , galactic - law screen or dusty galaxy extinction models , or with a system characterized by an old population with a 2 - 5myr burst and the same extinction laws .",
    "extinction laws with @xmath78=0.22 combined with measured cd colors generally produce values too blue to be consistent with any of our galaxy models .",
    "our analyses reveal several things .",
    "the light at 1520 is best characterized by an exponential or disk - like light profile with a scale length of 4kpc .",
    "similarly , the f702w light is best matched by a predominantly disk - like profile but with scale length of 2 kpc .",
    "the uv  optical colors match those of models with continuous star formation for @xmath81 gyr or those of an old galaxy with a massive , young ( @xmath82 myr ) burst .",
    "both of these properties are consistent with the uv light coming from an accreted population formed in a cluster cooling flow or from an episode of star formation induced by an interaction with a much smaller galaxy .",
    "the cooling flow scenario has the following points as supporting evidence ( a ) line ratios indicative of shock heated gas and ( b ) the inner surface brightness profile does not show significant disturbances in the uv or optical bands .",
    "however , detailed image analyses of deep @xmath16 imaging by @xcite appears to have revealed possible debris associated with an interaction of the cd with two small galaxies .",
    "these features are too faint to have been detected with the uit .",
    "high resolution images in the uv would help further constrain the nature of the uv bright population .",
    "we wish to thank brian mcnamara for providing us with a @xmath83-band image of abell 1795 .",
    "eps also thanks jason pinkney for helpful comments about photometry of hst images .",
