    "gamma - ray lines from solar flares were first observed in 1972 with the gamma - ray spectrometer ( grs ) aboard the _ oso-7 _ satellite @xcite . since then , repeated observations with various space missions , including the _ solar maximum mission_/grs ( e.g. share & murphy 1995 ) , all four _ compton gamma ray observatory _ instruments ( e.g. share , murphy , & ryan 1997 ) and the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ ;",
    "e.g. lin et al .",
    "2003 ) , have firmly established gamma - ray astronomy as an important tool for studying the active sun .",
    "prompt gamma - ray lines are produced from deexcitation of nuclei excited by nuclear interactions of flare - accelerated particles with the solar atmosphere .",
    "detailed spectroscopic analyses of this emission have furnished valuable information on the composition of the ambient flare plasma , as well as on the composition , energy spectrum and angular distribution of the accelerated ions ( e.g. ramaty & mandzhavidze 2000 ; share & murphy 2001 ; lin et al .",
    "2003 ; kiener et al .",
    "additional information about the density and temperature of the ambient plasma is obtained from the positron - electron annihilation line at 0.511 mev ( murphy et al .",
    "2005 ) and the neutron capture line at 2.223 mev ( hua et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the bombardment of the solar atmosphere by flare - accelerated ions can also synthesize radioactive nuclei , whose decay can produce observable , delayed gamma - ray lines in the aftermath of large flares .",
    "one of the most promising of such lines is at 846.8  kev resulting from the decay of @xmath6co ( half - life @xmath9=77.2  days ) into the first excited state of @xmath6fe @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the time dependence of the 846.8  kev line emission that would have been expected after the 6 x - class flares of june 1991 .",
    "smith et al .",
    "are now searching for this delayed line emission with the _ rhessi _ spectrometer after the very intense series of flares that occured between 2003 october 28 and november 4 ( the analysis is in progress , d. smith 2006 , private communication ) .",
    "the observation of solar radioactivity can be important for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the radioisotopes can serve as tracers to study mixing processes in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "additionally , their detection should provide a new insight into the spectrum and fluence of flare - accelerated ions .",
    "in particular , since the accelerated heavy nuclei are believed to be significantly enhanced as compared to the ambient medium composition ( e.g. murphy et al . 1991 ) , the radioisotopes are expected to be predominantly produced by interactions of fast heavy ions with ambient hydrogen and helium .",
    "thus , the delayed line emission can provide a valuable measurement of the accelerated metal enrichment .",
    "we performed a systematic study of the radioactive line emission expected after large solar flares .",
    "in addition to gamma - ray lines emitted from deexcitation of daughter nuclei , we considered radioactivity x - ray lines that can be produced from the decay of proton - rich isotopes by orbital electron capture or the decay of isomeric nuclear levels by emission of a conversion electron .",
    "we also treated the positron - electron annihilation line resulting from the decay of long - lived @xmath2-emitters . the radioisotopes which we studied are listed in table  1 , together with their main decay lines .",
    "we selected radioactive x- and gamma - ray line emitters that can be significantly produced in solar flares ( see   2 ) and with half - lives between @xmath310  min , which is the typical duration of large gamma - ray flares @xcite , and 77.2  days ( @xmath6co half - life ) .",
    "we neglected radioisotopes with mean lifetime @xmath15 greater than that of @xmath6co , because ( 1 ) their activity ( @xmath16 ) is lower and ( 2 ) their chance of surviving at the solar surface is also lower .    in   2 , we present the total cross sections for the production of the most important radioactive nuclei . in   3 , we describe our thick - target yield calculations of the radioisotope synthesis .",
    "the results for the delayed line emission are presented in   4 .",
    "prospects for observations are discussed in ",
    "all of the radioactive nuclei shown in table  1 can be significantly produced in solar flares by h and he interactions with elements among the most abundant of the solar atmosphere and accelerated particles : he , c , n , o , ne , mg , al , si , s , ar , ca , cr , mn , fe and ni . we did not consider the production of radioisotopes with atomic number @xmath17 . we also neglected a number of very neutron - rich nuclei ( e.g. @xmath18 mg , @xmath19s ... ) , whose production in solar flares should be very low .",
    "most of the radioisotopes listed in table  1 are proton - rich , positron emitters .",
    "their production by proton and @xmath1-particle reactions with the abundant constituents of cosmic matter was treated in detail by kozlovsky , lingenfelter , & ramaty ( 1987 ) .",
    "the work of these authors was extended by kozlovsky , murphy , & share ( 2004 ) to include @xmath2-emitter production from the most important reactions induced by accelerated @xmath0he .",
    "however , new laboratory measurements have allowed us to significantly improve the evaluation of a number of cross sections for the production of important positron emitters . in the following , we present updated cross sections for the formation of @xmath20cl@xmath8 , @xmath7mn@xmath10 , @xmath7mn@xmath8 , @xmath12co , @xmath6co , @xmath14ni , @xmath13co@xmath10 , @xmath11cu , and @xmath21cu , by proton , @xmath0he and @xmath1 reactions in the energy range 110@xmath0 mev nucleon@xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we evaluate cross sections for the production of the 4 radioactive nuclei of table  1 which are not positron emitters : @xmath23be , @xmath24na , @xmath6mn and @xmath13co@xmath8 .    the reactions which we studied are listed in table  2 .",
    "we considered proton , @xmath0he and @xmath1-particle interactions with elements of atomic numbers close to that of the radioisotope of interest and that are among the most abundant of the solar atmosphere .",
    "spallation reactions with more than 4 outgoing particles were generally not selected , because their cross sections are usually too low and their threshold energies too high to be important for solar flares .",
    "we generally considered reactions with elements of natural isotopic compositions , because , except for h and the noble gases , the terrestrial isotopic compositions are representative of the solar isotopic abundances @xcite .",
    "furthermore , most of the laboratory measurements we used were performed with natural targets .",
    "most of the cross section data were extracted from the exfor database for experimental reaction data .",
    "when laboratory measurements were not available or did not cover the full energy range , we used 3 different nuclear reaction codes to obtain theoretical estimates .",
    "below a few hundred mev ( total kinetic energy of the fast particles ) , we performed calculations with both empire - ii ( version 2.19 ; herman et al .",
    "2004 ) and talys ( version 0.64 ; koning , hilaire , & duijvestijn 2005 ) .",
    "these computer programs account for major nuclear reaction models for direct , compound , pre - equilibrium and fission reactions .",
    "they include comprehensive libraries of nuclear structure parameters , such as masses , discrete level properties , resonances and gamma - ray parameters .",
    "the talys and empire - ii calculations were systematically compared with available data and the agreement was generally found to be better than a factor of 2 .",
    "we obtained , however , more accurate predictions for isomeric cross sections with talys than with empire - ii .    above the energy range covered by talys and empire - ii",
    ", we used the `` silberberg & tsao code '' ( silberberg , tsao , & barghouty 1998 and references therein ) when experimental cross section data for proton - nucleus spallation reactions were lacking .",
    "this code is based on the semiempirical formulation originally developed by @xcite for estimates of cross sections needed in cosmic - ray physics .",

    "these prompt narrow lines are produced in reactions of energetic protons and @xmath1-particles with ambient @xmath33c , @xmath34n , @xmath35o and @xmath91ne ( see kozlovsky et al .",
    "we can see that , relative to these two gamma - ray lines , the production of most of the radioisotopes increases as the accelerated particle spectrum becomes harder ( i.e. with decreasing @xmath90 ) .",
    "this is because the radioactive nuclei are produced by spallation reactions at higher energies , on average , than the @xmath33c and @xmath35o line emission , which partly results from inelastic scattering reactions .",
    "because of the enhanced heavy accelerated particle composition , most of the yield is from interactions of heavy accelerated particles with ambient h and he .",
    "for example , the contribution of fast fe and ni collisions with ambient h and he accounts for more than 90% of the total @xmath6co production , whatever the spectral index @xmath90 .",
    "because we are interested in emission after the end of the gamma - ray flare , we show in the fifth column of table  3 a factor @xmath92 which should be multiplied with the given yields to take into account the decay of the radioactive nuclei occuring before the end of the flare .",
    "it was calculated from the simplifying assumption that the radioisotope production rate is constant with time during the flare for a time period @xmath93 .",
    "we then have @xmath94 where @xmath15 is the mean lifetime of radioisotope @xmath60 . in table  3 , @xmath92 is given for @xmath93=10  min .",
    "calculated fluxes of the most intense delayed lines are shown in tables  46 for three different times after a large gamma - ray flare .",
    "the lines are given in decreasing order of their flux for @xmath90=3.5 .",
    "the calculations were normalized to a total fluence of the summed 4.44 and 6.13  mev prompt narrow lines @xmath95=300 photons  @xmath96 , which is the approximate fluence observed in the 2003 october 28 flare with _",
    "integral_/spi @xcite .",
    "the flux of a given delayed line @xmath97 produced by the decay of a radioisotope @xmath60 at time @xmath98 after the end of the nucleosynthesis phase was obtained from @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the yields ( table  3 ) of the parent radioisotope and summed prompt @xmath33c and @xmath35o lines , respectively , and @xmath102 is the line branching ratio ( the percentages shown in table  1 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath92 was calculated for a flare duration of 10  min ( table  3 ) .",
    "the calculated fluxes do not take into account attenuation of the line photons in the solar atmosphere .",
    "unless the flare is very close to the solar limb , the attenuation of the delayed gamma - ray lines should not be significant ( see hua , ramaty , & lingenfelter 1989 ) as long as the radioactive nuclei do not plunge deep in the solar convection zone .",
    "the delayed x - ray lines can be more significantly attenuated by photoelectric absorption ( see below )",
    ".    a full knowledge of the delayed 511  kev line flux would require a comprehensive calculation of the accelerated particle transport , solar atmospheric depth distribution of @xmath2-emitter production and transport of the emitted positrons , because ( 1 ) the number of 2@xmath103 line photons produced per emitted positron ( @xmath104 ) crucially depends on the density , temperature and ionization state of the solar annihilation environment @xcite , ( 2 ) significant escape of positrons from the annihilation region can occur , and ( 3 ) the line can be attenuated by compton scattering in the solar atmosphere . here , we simply assumed @xmath104=1 ( see kozlovsky et al .",
    "2004 ; murphy et al . 2005 ) and neglected the line attenuation .",
    "we see in tables  4 and 5 that the annihilation line is predicted to be the most intense delayed line for hours after the flare end .",
    "after @xmath32  days however , its flux can become lower than that of the 846.8  kev line from the decay of @xmath6co into @xmath6fe ( see table  6 ) .",
    "we show in figure  11 the time dependence of the 511  kev line flux , for @xmath90=3.5 and @xmath93=10  min , together with the contributions of the main radioactive positron emitters to the line production .",
    "we see that from @xmath31 to @xmath314  hours , @xmath105f is the main source of the positrons .",
    "since this radioisotope can be mainly produced by the reaction @xmath35o(@xmath0he,@xmath39)@xmath105f , we suggest that a future detection of the decay curve of the solar 511  kev line could provide an independent measurement of the flare - accelerated @xmath0he abundance .",
    "prompt line measurements have not yet furnished an unambiguous determination of the fast @xmath0he enrichment ( manzhavidze et al .",
    "1997 ) .    among the 9 atomic lines listed in table  1",
    ", the most promising appears to be the co k@xmath1 line at 6.92  kev ( tables  45 ) .",
    "it is produced from both the decay of the isomer @xmath13co@xmath8 by the conversion of a k - shell electron and the decay of @xmath14ni by orbital electron capture .",
    "additional important atomic lines are the fe and ni k@xmath1 lines at 6.40 and 7.47  kev , respectively . the x - ray line fluxes shown in tables  4 and 5 should be taken as upper limits , however , because photoelectric absorption of the emitted x - rays was not taken into account , as it depends on the flare location and model of accelerated ion transport .",
    "calculations in the framework of the solar magnetic loop model ( hua et al .",
    "1989 ) showed that the interaction site of nuclear reactions is expected to be in the lower chromosphere , at solar depths corresponding to column densities of 10@xmath106 to 10@xmath22  g @xmath96 .",
    "these results were reinforced by the gamma - ray spectroscopic analyses of @xcite , who showed that the bulk of the nuclear reactions are produced in flare regions where the ambient composition is close to coronal , i.e. above the photosphere .",
    "for such column densities of material of coronal composition , we calculated from the photoelectric absorption cross sections of @xcite that the optical depths of 6.92  kev escaping photons are between @xmath310@xmath106 and 10@xmath22 .",
    "thus , the attenuation of this x - ray line is expected to be @xmath10710% for flares occuring at low heliocentric angles .",
    "however , the line attenuation can be much higher for flares near the solar limb .",
    "a serious complication to the x - ray line measurements could arise from the confusion of the radioactivity lines with the intense thermal emission from the flare plasma .",
    "in particular , this could prevent a detection of the delayed x - ray lines for hours after the impulsive flaring phase , until the thermal emission has become sufficiently low .",
    "the necessary distinction of thermal and nonthermal photons would certainly benefit from an x - ray instrument with high spectral resolution , because k@xmath1 lines from neutral to low - ionized fe , co or ni are not expected from thermal plasmas at ionization equilibrium .",
    "the neutral co line at 6.92  kev could still be confused , however , with the thermal k@xmath1 line of fe xxvi at 6.97  kev .",
    "the neutral fe k@xmath1 line at 6.40  kev is commonly observed during large solar flares ( e.g. culhane et al .",
    "1981 ) , as a result of photoionization by flare x - rays and collisional ionization by accelerated electrons ( e.g. zarro , dennis , & slater 1992 ) .",
    "however , this nonthermal line emission is not expected to extend beyond the impulsive phase .",
    "a near future detection of delayed nuclear gamma - ray lines is perhaps more probable .",
    "we see in table  4 that at @xmath98=30  min after the flare , the brightest gamma - ray line ( after the 511  kev line ) is at 1434  kev from the @xmath2 decay of the isomeric state @xmath7mn@xmath8 into @xmath7cr .",
    "the flux of this line is predicted to significantly increase as the accelerated particle spectrum becomes harder , because it is mainly produced from fe spallation reactions at relatively high energies , @xmath10810  mev nucleon@xmath22 ( figure  4 ) . for @xmath98@xmath1093  hours ,",
    "the radioactivity of @xmath7mn@xmath8 ( @xmath9=21.1  min ) has become negligible and the 1434  kev line essentially results from the decay of the ground state @xmath7mn@xmath10 ( @xmath9=5.59  days ) .",
    "thus , this line remains significant for several days after the flare .",
    "however , for @xmath98@xmath1092  days , the most intense line could be at 846.8  kev from @xmath6co decay , depending on the spectral index @xmath90 ( see table  6 ) .",
    "additional important gamma - ray lines during the first hour are at 1332 and 1792  kev from the radioactivity of @xmath11cu . during the first two days",
    ", one should also look for the line at 931.1  kev from the radioactivity of @xmath12co and for those at 1369 and 2754  kev from @xmath24na decay .",
    "we now discuss the influence of the accelerated ion composition on the delayed line emission . in figure  12 , we show calculated fluences of the 846.8 and 1434  kev lines as a function of the accelerated @xmath88 abundance ratio .",
    "they were obtained from the equation @xmath110 where the yields @xmath100 and @xmath101 were calculated for various proton abundances relative to @xmath1-particles and the other accelerated ions .",
    "thus , the predicted fluence variations with accelerated @xmath88 actually show the relative contributions of reactions induced by fast protons .",
    "the fluences decrease for decreasing @xmath88 ratio ( i.e. increasing proton abundance ) , because , for @xmath88@xmath1090.05 , the radioisotopes are predominantly produced by spallation of accelerated heavy nuclei , whose abundances are significantly enhanced in impulsive flares , whereas the ambient @xmath33c and @xmath35o lines largely result from fast proton interactions .",
    "this effect is less pronounced for @xmath90=5 , because for this very soft spectrum , the contribution of @xmath1-particle reactions to the prompt line emission is more important .",
    "obviously , the detection of any delayed line from a solar flare should furnish valuable information on the accelerated particle composition and energy spectrum .",
    "determination of the accelerated particle composition from spectroscopy of prompt line emission is difficult .",
    "we have made a detailed evaluation of the nuclear data relevant to the production of radioactive line emission in the aftermath of large solar flares .",
    "we have presented updated cross sections for the synthesis of the major radioisotopes by proton , @xmath0he and @xmath1 reactions , and have provided theoretical thick - target yields , which allow flux estimates for all the major delayed lines at any time after a gamma - ray flare .",
    "together with the 846.8  kev line from @xmath6co decay , whose importance was already pointed out by @xcite , our study has revealed other gamma - ray lines that appear to be promising for detection , e.g. at 1434 kev from @xmath7mn@xmath50 , 1332 and 1792  kev from @xmath11cu , 2127 kev from @xmath20cl@xmath8 , 1369 and 2754  kev from @xmath24na , and 931.1  kev from @xmath12co . the strongest delayed x - ray line is found to be the co k@xmath1 at 6.92  kev , which is produced from both the decay of the isomer @xmath13co@xmath8 by the conversion of a k - shell electron and the decay of @xmath14ni by orbital electron capture . distinguishing this atomic line from the thermal x - ray emission",
    "can be challenging until the flare plasma has significantly cooled down .",
    "however , a few hours after the flare the thermal emission will be gone or significantly reduced and the delayed co k@xmath1 line will be more easily detected .",
    "delayed gamma - ray lines could be detected sooner after the end of the impulsive phase , as the prompt nonthermal gamma - ray emission vanishes more rapidly .",
    "the lines will be very narrow , because the radioactive nuclei are stopped by energy losses in the solar atmosphere before they decay .",
    "although generally weaker than the main prompt lines , some delayed lines emitted after large flares can have fluences within the detection capabilities of the _ rhessi _ spectrometer or future space instruments .",
    "multiple flares originating from the same active region of the sun can build up the radioactivity , thus increasing the chance for detection .    however , a major complication to the measurements can arise from the fact that the same radioactivity lines can be produced in the instrument and spacecraft materials from fast particle interactions .",
    "a line of solar origin could sometimes be disentangled from the instrumental line at the same energy by their different time evolutions .",
    "but the bombardment of the satellite by solar energetic particles associated with the gamma - ray flare can make this selection more difficult .    a positive detection of delayed radioactivity lines , hopefully with _ rhessi _",
    ", would certainly provide unique information on the flare - accelerated particle composition and energy spectrum .",
    "in particular , since the enrichment of the accelerated heavy elements can be the major source of the radioisotopes , their detection should furnish a valuable measurement of this enhancement .",
    "thus , a concomitant detection of the two lines at 846.8 and 1434  kev could allow measurement of not only the abundance of accelerated fe ions , but also of their energy spectrum ( see figure  12 ) .",
    "a future measurement of the decay curve of the electron - positron annihilation line or of other delayed gamma - ray lines would be very useful for studying solar atmospheric mixing .",
    "the lines should be strongly attenuated by compton scattering when the radioactive nuclei plunge deep in the solar interior .",
    "the use of several radioisotopes with different lifetimes should place constraints on the extents and timescales of mixing processes in the outer convection zone .",
    "in addition , the imaging capabilities of _ rhessi _ could allow measurement of the size and development of the radioactive patch on the solar surface .",
    "this would provide unique information on both the transport of flare - accelerated particles and dynamics of solar active regions .",
    "it is noteworthy that solar radioactivity can be the only way to study flares that had recently occured over the east limb .",
    "radioactive nuclei produced in solar flares can also be detected directly if they escape from the sun into interplanetary space . at present , only two long - lived radioisotopes of solar - flare origin have been identified , @xmath34c ( @xmath9=5.7@xmath11110@xmath0 years , jull , lal , & donahue 1995 ) and @xmath112be ( @xmath9=1.51@xmath11110@xmath113 years , nishiizumi & caffe 2001 ) , from measurements of the solar wind implanted in the outer layers of lunar grains .",
    "based on the measured abundances relative to calculated average production rates in flares , a large part of these radioactive species must be ejected in the solar wind and energetic - particle events rather than being mixed into the bulk of the solar convection zone .",
    "detection of solar radioactivities with shorter lifetimes , either directly in interplanetary space or from their delayed line emission , are expected to provide a new insight into the destiny of the nuclei synthesized in solar flares .",

    "<S> we have studied the radioactive line emission expected from solar active regions after large flares , following the production of long - lived radioisotopes by nuclear interactions of flare - accelerated ions . </S>",
    "<S> this delayed x- and gamma - ray line emission can provide unique information on the accelerated particle composition and energy spectrum , as well as on mixing processes in the solar atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> total cross sections for the formation of the main radioisotopes by proton , @xmath0he and @xmath1-particle reactions are evaluated from available data combined with nuclear reaction theory . </S>",
    "<S> thick - target radioisotope yields are provided in tabular form , which can be used to predict fluxes of all of the major delayed lines at any time after a gamma - ray flare . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest delayed line for days after the flare is found to be the 511  kev positron - electron annihilation line resulting from the decay of several @xmath2 radioisotopes . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath32  days however , the flux of the @xmath4@xmath5 annihilation line can become lower than that of the 846.8  kev line from the decay of @xmath6co into @xmath6fe . </S>",
    "<S> our study has revealed other delayed gamma - ray lines that appear to be promising for detection , e.g. at 1434 kev from the radioactivity of both the isomer @xmath7mn@xmath8 ( @xmath9=21.1  min ) and the ground state @xmath7mn@xmath10 ( @xmath9=5.59  days ) , 1332 and 1792  kev from @xmath11cu ( @xmath9=23.7  min ) , and 931.1  kev from @xmath12co ( @xmath9=17.5  hours ) . the strongest delayed x - ray line is found to be the co k@xmath1 at 6.92  kev , which is produced from both the decay of the isomer @xmath13co@xmath8 ( @xmath9=9.04  hours ) by the conversion of a k - shell electron and the decay of @xmath14ni ( @xmath9=35.6  hours ) by orbital electron capture . </S>",
