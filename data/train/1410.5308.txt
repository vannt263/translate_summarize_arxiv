    "in recent years , modeling and simulation ( m&s ) tools have become ubiquitous due to the rapid growth in computing power and significant developments in numerical techniques .",
    "predictive science , which involves the utilization of verified and validated computer simulations in studying complex physical phenomena , has become especially useful in multi - physics applications involving heat transfer , fluid flow , structural dynamics , chemical kinetics and nuclear processes , due to the difficulty and costs associated with experimental testing",
    ". however , to validate numerical predictions against experimental observations , uncertainties ( characterized as random quantities ) must be included within the associated physical model .",
    "this is primarily because mathematical descriptions of physical processes are often unphysical idealizations of their target scenarios ( in terms of material and geometric properties ) , and also because knowledge of the model parameters is usually limited .",
    "uncertainty quantification ( uq ) has therefore emerged as a vital discipline in the certification of predictive simulations .",
    "once the uncertain parameters of a physical system have been identified , a uq study entails the following sequence of steps : ( 1 ) uncertainty characterization , ( 2 ) uncertainty propagation and ( 3 ) uncertainty analysis .    in most cases where",
    "physical systems are formulated as partial differential equations ( pdes ) with random inputs , uncertainty propagation becomes a compuationally demanding task .",
    "monte - carlo ( mc ) based sampling [ , ] , wherein a set of input samples are generated and the corresponding output samples are collected via repeated simulation runs , is the simplest strategy to tackle this problem .",
    "however , obtaining a large enough sample size to perform accurate uncertainty analysis can be prohibitively expensive due to the slow convergence rate of mc .",
    "alternative approaches , involving the construction of response surfaces of the quantities of interest using sparse regression methods [ , ] and subsequently sampling the surrogate model , have been proposed . however , in the context of multi - physics models , governed by coupled pde systems , these methods ignore the coupling structures , which can be potentially exploited to reduce computational costs .",
    "although spectral uncertainty propagation methods , for example , generalized polynomials chaos ( gpc ) [ ] based methods , exhibit geometric convergence properties , their monolithic implementations , would succumb to the curse of dimensionality .",
    "multi - physics systems , are naturally suited for modular ( partitioned ) solution strategies [ , ] , wherein specialized numerical methods and solvers for each constituent single - physics component can be reused and integrated with minimal effort , to construct solvers for the full system .",
    "these methods can therefore facilitate a natural division of m&s expertise , and consequently a drastic reduction of developmental costs and maintanence overheads associated with multi - physics software .",
    "however , extending standard modularization practices for efficient uncertainty propagation yet remains challenging .    in this work",
    ", we propose a module - based reduced intrusive spectral projection ( isp ) method for gpc based uncertainty propagation in coupled pde solvers .",
    "in addition to providing a practical framework for solver modularization , our proposed method mitigates the curse of dimensionality by constructing reduced approximations of the input data before being communicated to their respective computational modules .",
    "the reduced approximations are constructed via simple linear algebraic transformations , and corresponding optimal quadrature rules are constructed to significantly reduce the repeated number of module executions .",
    "previous work has exploited relatively trivial coupling structures , for example , unidirectional coupling [ ] and linear coupling [ , , ] , to reduce the costs of uncertainty propagation , while here , we consider a more general setup with bidirectional and nonlinear coupling structures in the model .",
    "moreover , constantine et .",
    "al [ ] successfully demonstrated a reduced approximation method for network ( weakly ) coupled systems and our proposed method extends the approach towards field ( strongly ) coupled models .",
    "several components of our proposed approach have been motivated by the recent works of arnst et .",
    "al [ , , ] , wherein reduced chaos representations [ ] are proposed as the reduced approximations .",
    "a limitation of their approach however , is that computational gains can only be achieved in some of the modules , since the dimension and order reduction is implemented unidirectionally .",
    "we address this limitation in our proposed method by facilitating the construction of reduced approximations across all the modules .",
    "moreover , the respective tolerance values , which control the approximation errors , can be individually prescribed for each module .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in",
    ", the preliminary definitions and concepts concerning isp based uncertainty propagation for a stochastic multi - physics system are introduced along with a description of the standard isp method . in",
    ", we describe the proposed reduced isp method by addressing each of its components individually . in , we report and compare the performance and accuracy of the standard and reduced isp method implementations on two numerical examples .",
    "without loss of generality , we consider to a multi - physics setup wherin a two - component system of stochastic , steady - state pdes are bidirectionally coupled .",
    "the analysis that will be presented can be trivially extended to unsteady systems as well .",
    "a spatial discretization of each component of the system yields the coupled stochastic algebraic system:@xmath0\\in\\xi,$ ] @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the component residuals , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the component solution vectors , which represent the respective finite - dimensional discretizations of the spatially varying solution fields intrinsic in each respective component pde system .",

    "moreover , the indexing in the polynomial series is assumed to follow a total degree ordering , such that @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 denotes the total degree of @xmath32 .",

    "moreover , a corollary to the theorem states that if the regularity of @xmath20 is @xmath44 , then the asymptotic rate of convergence is polynomial and the upper bound in the mean - square error would be @xmath45 .    for computing statistical quantities of interest such as the moments and",
    "related probability density functions of the solutions via exhaustive sampling , the gpc approximation can be used as a significantly cheaper surrogate model when compared to repeated executions of a costly numerical pde solver .",
    "in particular , approximations of the first two moments can be computed directly from the gpc coefficients as follows .",
    "@xmath46    moreover , the probability distribution function of any related quantity of interest can be computed with the kernel density estimation ( kde ) method [ , using a large number of surrogate solution samples .",
    "therefore , prior to any uncertainty analysis , the coefficient matrices of the solutions must be computed via intrusive spectral projection ( isp ) or non - intrusive spectral projection ( nisp ) based uncertainty propagation methods .",
    "the focus of this work is the stochastic galerkin method [ , which is a commonly used isp based uncertainty propagation method .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the space of polynomials in @xmath17 , with total degree @xmath48 .",

    "can be numerically solved using either monolithic ( fully - coupled ) or modular ( partitioned ) methods .",
    "a monolithic approach , for example , newton s method , would require the solution of the fully - coupled linear system @xmath59\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\underline{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{1}^{\\ell+1}}-\\underline{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{1}^{\\ell}}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\underline{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{2}^{\\ell+1}}-\\underline{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{2}^{\\ell } } \\end{array}\\right]=-\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\underline{{\\displaystyle \\hat{\\boldsymbol{f}}_{1}}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{1}^{\\ell};\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{2}^{\\ell}\\right)\\\\ \\\\ \\\\",

    "for example , fluid - structure interaction models [ contains elliptic and hyperbolic pdes , which are spatially discretized using finite element and finite volume methods respectively .",
    "moreover , the quadratic convergence rate may not be guaranteed in practice .",
    "furthermore , variants of newton s method , for instance , gauss - newton [ and levenberg - marquardt [ , when implemented in this monolithic fashion , would also be affected by these limitations .    a modular solution method , for example",
