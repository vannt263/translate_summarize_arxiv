    "changes in as correlations relative to the ss peak should first be attributed to the parton - parton relationship , dominated by @xmath16 production during initial - state n - n ( parton - parton ) scattering .",
    "the role of @xmath16 ( nucleon - intrinsic and from initial - state parton multiple scattering ) even in p - p collisions is quite significant .",
    "the as peak width in p - p collisions is typically 50% larger than the ss peak , reflecting jet acoplanarity from the @xmath16 contribution to parton - parton transverse center - of - mass motion .",
    "the mean nucleon path length ( as n - n encounters ) is six in central au - au , implying up to six - fold increase in @xmath16 variance or 2.5-fold increase in as peak width , which then accounts for typical as widths @xmath164 in central au - au collisions .",
    "application of @xmath3 cuts to emulate jet reconstruction can strongly bias jet - related azimuth correlations , leading to misinterpretations . to interpret the consequences of @xmath3 cuts correctly a valid model of parton fragmentation ( fragmentation functions or ffs in vacuum and medium ) and parton - parton correlations ( @xmath16 effects ) is required .    for single - parton fragmentation ( e.g. , `` in - vacuum '' jets ) in 200 gev p - p collisions the following trends",
    "are observed  @xcite : 1 ) the peak ( mode ) of ffs occurs in 1 - 2 gev / c for all parton energies from 3 gev up to several hundred gev  @xcite .",
    "2 ) p - p ffs are strongly suppressed below 1 gev / c compared to jets in @xmath165-@xmath166 collisions .",
    "3 ) about half the fragments from minimum - bias jets or `` minijets '' in p - p collisions , with most - probable parton energy = 3 gev , appear below 1 gev / c .",
    "some implications of those systematics are : 1 ) a typical trigger @xmath3 cut at 4 gev / c eliminates _ most _ scattered partons , since @xmath167 , the mode of the parton spectrum is near 3 gev and the spectrum is falling @xmath168 .",
    "2 ) ff suppression at smaller fragment momentum in p - p collisions already narrows jet angular correlations relative to in - vacuum jets from e - e collisions .",
    "3 ) an associated @xmath3 cut at 2 gev / c ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) eliminates most of the ff for any parton energy , further narrowing jet angular correlations ( only the `` tip '' of the jet survives ) .",
    "a trigger @xmath3 cut biases the underlying parton spectrum to larger energies and so could in principle be useful for systematic energy - loss studies .",
    "however , the trigger cut also biases the associated @xmath16 distribution , especially in more - central au - au collisions where accumulated @xmath16 can be large .",
    "aside from jet ( parton ) acoplanarity ( @xmath16 broadening of the as azimuth peak ) a unique consequence of the trigger cut is a @xmath16 bias in which the parton - pair @xmath16 sum is preferentially oriented nearly parallel to the trigger - parton momentum , thereby increasing the trigger - parton momentum and decreasing the partner momentum _ in the laboratory frame_. such @xmath16 bias can give an impression of large as energy loss in a dense medium when the ss / as momentum asymmetry is actually due to initial - state @xmath16 .    in - medium modification of ffs in more - central au - au collisions can be described by alteration of the splitting process  @xcite , wherein energy is not lost from a jet , is instead redistributed on @xmath3 to a degree depending on au - au centrality .",
    "more _ jet - correlated _ fragments appear at smaller @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the effect is observed in untriggered two - particle correlations , including a sharp transition at intermediate au - au centrality between unmodified p - p jets and strongly - modified but still intact jets in more - central au - au  @xcite .",
    "modification of ffs in central au - au collisions can transport much of the jet below an associated - particle @xmath3 cut interval , giving the false impression that back - to - back _ parton _ pairs are suppressed , i.e. , that one parton is `` thermalized '' in a dense medium .      this analysis demonstrates that for any case where there is significant ss and as peak overlap the zyam assumption discards a significant fraction of the true jet yield . in more - central collisions up to 90% of the jet yield",
    "may be discarded as a result of zyam plus @xmath1 oversubtraction , as in fig .",
    "[ phenix ] ( as peak ) .",
    "oversubtraction of @xmath1 , which is guaranteed by conventional subtraction methods , further reduces the apparent jet yield and introduces strong distortions in as correlations .",
    "the resulting distortions can be misinterpreted as evidence that a large fraction of scattered partons is thermalized in a dense medium , and that novel qcd phenomena result .    in",
    "@xcite the double - peaked as structure induced in two - particle correlations is duplicated in a more - complex three - particle correlation analysis .",
    "the analysis is intended to demonstrate that relative to a trigger particle some pairs of as particles are widely separated by a characteristic angle which might imply conical emission from a parton passing through a dense medium , as in mach - cone shock waves  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the distance of as `` mach peaks '' from @xmath19 ( `` cone opening angle '' ) does not depend on a - a centrality or associated - particle @xmath3 .",
    "the fixed opening angle has been interpreted to measure the speed of sound in the qcd medium  @xcite . yet",
    "the properties of a true qcd medium ought to depend strongly on a - a centrality ( e.g. , compared to p - p collisions ) .",
    "the present analysis indicates that the as double peak is an artifact having a fixed form for simple algebraic reasons , with no relation to collision dynamics or a qcd medium .",
    "untriggered 2d angular autocorrelations  @xcite differ from conventional triggered dihadron correlation analysis in several ways : 1 ) absent trigger / associated @xmath3 cuts the entire fragment yield from the entire minimum - bias parton spectrum is measured .",
    "2 ) no _ ad hoc _ ( zyam ) offset is imposed ; the offset is inferred from free fits to correlation structure .",
    "3 ) model fits impose only minimal _ a priori _ assumptions which are subsequently tested with data .",
    "4 ) no external @xmath4 measurement is imposed ; an independent quadrupole component is inferred directly from the model fit .",
    "5 ) the ss peak is uniquely isolated in the 2d fit due to its @xmath17 dependence .",
    "6 ) remaining structure is described by model - independent azimuth fourier amplitudes .",
    "the measured quadrupole amplitude serves as an upper limit to any nonjet quadrupole component .",
    "unsubtracted dihadron correlations for pairs within specific @xmath3 cut bins serve as the best measurement of joint distribution @xmath169 simultaneously with corresponding jet structure .",
    "zyam subtraction disregards direct @xmath0 measurements , instead invokes products of @xmath9 marginal values of questionable accuracy ( large jet or `` nonflow '' contribution likely ) .",
    "conventional @xmath9 measurements for 0 - 5% central au - au collisions imply @xmath170 , whereas untriggered 2d angular correlations return @xmath171 .",
    "the difference in quadrupole amplitude @xmath1 is a factor 30 - 50 .",
    "the ss 2d gaussian is tightly constrained by the 2d fit .",
    "its amplitude is not available , as in a 1d fit , to offset distortions of the as peak imposed by @xmath1 ( quadrupole ) oversubtraction . _",
    "no double - peaked as structure has been observed in 2d angular autocorrelations_.      whatever the subsequent analysis , unmodified dihadron pair distributions with absolute pair numbers per collision event should be published for all collision systems . a neutral presentation method for untriggered angular correlations normalizes the number of mixed pairs ( reference ) to the number of sibling ( same - event ) pairs  @xcite .",
    "the integral of the net - pair distribution ( number of `` correlated '' pairs ) is made zero by construction to avoid suggesting that the net - pair number is known a priori .",
    "the true offset can be estimated subsequently via model fits .",
    "mean event multiplicities for accepted particles should be included in the presentation .",
    "the fit model should be as simple as possible ( minimum parameter number ) yet physically interpretable .",
    "peaks can be distinguished from background by model fits as long as the peaks are resolved according to the rayleigh criterion ( sum of r.m.s .",
    "widths significantly less than peak separation @xmath19 , which is typically satisfied for azimuth correlations ) . the gaussian shape for the ss peak may be questioned in isolated cases ( cf .",
    "[ pythia ] ) , but for most cases of relevance to rhic data the 1d ( on azimuth ) or 2d gaussian model should be adequate .    for higher @xmath3 cuts and/or p - p collisions the as azimuth peak may be described by a gaussian . for untriggered correlations and/or for more - central au - au collisions",
    "the as peak width increases substantially , the higher fourier components of the as gaussian decrease , and only a few terms of a fourier series may be required . in the asymptotic limit",
    "( e.g. , @xmath172 ) periodic as peak structure simplifies to a pure dipole plus constant .",
    "in intermediate cases fits with both models ( two gaussians+quadrupole , gaussian+dipole+quadrupole ) , including a sextupole in the fourier decomposition , provide optimal descriptions and estimates of systematic uncertainty .",
    "fits should be performed over the unbroken @xmath47 interval to respect and enforce periodicity of peak arrays .",
    "analysis of ss or as subintervals independently is inconsistent with discrete fourier series and can be misleading .",
    "i have examined the validity of jet structure isolated from dihadron azimuth correlations by combinatoric background subtraction based on zyam ( zero yield at minimum ) and conventional @xmath9 measurements .",
    "simulations of ideal correlation data compared to published rhic data demonstrate that in some cases zyam plus @xmath4 subtraction produces substantial distortions and underestimation of jet yields .",
    "combinatoric correlation analysis is a convenient method to access jet correlations in a - a collisions , but isolation of jet structure from the non - jet background presents technical challenges .",
    "the conventional background model includes a constant offset @xmath39 and an `` elliptic flow '' contribution nominally of the form @xmath22 .",
    "the zyam principle is invoked to determine @xmath39 , but zyam has no basis in conventional distribution analysis .",
    "the zyam method is defended by arguing that the detailed shapes of jet correlations are not known a priori .",
    "possible radiation effects and/or medium modifications to fragmentation could distort jet - related structure .",
    "zyam is then said to reduce systematic errors arising from uncertainties about jet peak shapes .",
    "in this study i use simulations with known peak structures to demonstrate that the zyam procedure can produce large systematic errors .",
    "systematic distortions may be much larger than any effects due to peak - shape uncertainties . especially for more - central a - a collisions the zyam assumption leads to substantial underestimation of jet correlation amplitudes , interpreted in turn to imply large parton energy loss in a thermalized dense medium",
    "i demonstrate that for typical correlations from rhic collisions simple peak models adequately describe jet correlation data .",
    "intrajet correlations ( same - side peak ) are well - described by a gaussian . in special cases",
    "a modified gaussian could accommodate width fluctuations due to radiation effects .",
    "interjet correlations ( awayside peak , back - to - back jets ) are well - described by a gaussian or , if the as width is large ( typical ) , by an azimuth dipole component . that model permits accurate determination of the background offset value , in contrast to zyam .",
    "conventional measurements of @xmath9 are susceptible to `` nonflow '' ( jet correlations ) . in the conventional method of dihadron correlation analysis @xmath22",
    "is overestimated , especially in more - central a - a collisions . as a result of @xmath1 oversubtraction the same - side jet peak",
    "is further reduced , and the away - side peak acquires a minimum at its center .",
    "away - side distortions have been interpreted as manifestations of mach shocks arising from sound propagation in a thermalized dense medium .    as a result of zyam subtraction",
    "the impression may be formed that most partons are stopped in a thermalized dense medium ( `` opaque core '' ) , that shock waves may be produced in the same medium as partons traverse the medium , giving rise to anomalous as structure .",
    "in contrast untriggered angular correlations described by free model fits reveal that jet yields increase even faster than binary collisions in more - central au - au collisions . there is no isolated `` away - side '' jet .",
    "away - side structure is undistorted and reflects jet - jet ( parton - parton ) correlations .",
    "jets are modified in more - central collisions , but all partons survive as final - state correlation structure .",
