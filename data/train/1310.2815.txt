    "in the field of dynamical systems , the notion of chaos means ` sensitivity to initial conditions ' and is quantified by the lyapunov exponent @xmath13 which governs the exponential growth of the distance between two dynamical trajectories @xmath14 that are separated by an infinitesimal distance @xmath15 at time @xmath16 . in the field of spin - glasses , the notion of chaos has been introduced as the sensitivity of the renormalization flow seen as a dynamical system , with respect to the initial conditions ( the random couplings ) or with respect to external parameters like the temperature @xmath17 or the magnetic field @xmath18 . on hierarchical lattices where explicit renormalization rules exist for the renormalized couplings @xmath19 , the chaos properties have been thus much studied @xcite . for other lattices without explicit renormalization rules , the droplet scaling theory @xcite allows to define the chaos properties as follows :    \\(i ) the effective renormalized coupling @xmath19 of a @xmath20-dimensional disordered sample of linear size @xmath21 containing @xmath22 spins can be defined as the difference between the free - energies @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponding to periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in the first direction respectively ( the other @xmath25 directions keep periodic boundary conditions ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the usual droplet exponent associated to the linear size @xmath21 , and where @xmath28 is an @xmath29 random variable of zero mean ( with a probability distribution symmetric in @xmath30 ) . in the following , we will use the droplet exponent @xmath31 defined here with respect to the total number @xmath32 of spins , in order to consider also fully connected models where the notion of length does not exist .",
