    "<S> in this paper , some new results are reported for the study of riemann zeta function @xmath0 in the critical strip @xmath1 , such as @xmath0 expressed in a generalized euler product only involving prime numbers . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , some new absolutely convergent series representations of @xmath0 based on binomial expansion are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial progress is to find that @xmath0 can be expressed as a linear combination of polynomials of infinite degree , whose consequences are shown in several aspects : ( i ) numerically it provides a scenario to construct very fast convergent algorithm to calculate @xmath0 ; ( ii ) interestingly it shows that lagrange interpolation using infinite number of integer euler zeta functions reproduces the exact complex @xmath0 ; ( iii ) surprisingly it demonstrates that alternating riemann zeta function ( or other entire functions removing the pole of zeta function ) is admissible to melzak combinatorial transform for polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> applying the functional symmetry on @xmath0 in the form of melzak transform induces @xmath0 being written as the difference of two symmetrized factorials whose zeros are proved to all have real part of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the two symmetrized factorials are proved to have interlacing between the two sequences of the imaginary part of their zeros on upper ( or lower ) half plane , which ensures the difference of the two symmetrized factorials [ proportional to @xmath0 ] attaining the same feature of zeros with real part of @xmath2 to endorse riemann hypothesis . </S>"
