    "heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite and non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite are two effective theories that describe the interactions of almost on - shell heavy quarks .",
    "hqet describes the interactions of quarks of mass @xmath2 in which the momentum transfer @xmath3 is much smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "the hqet lagrangian has an expansion in powers of @xmath4 .",
    "hqet is typically applied to hadrons containing a single heavy quark , such as the @xmath5 meson , in which @xmath6 , the scale of the strong interactions .",
    "the hqet expansion is thus an expansion in powers of @xmath7 .",
    "nrqcd describes the interactions of non - relativistic quarks , and is typically applied to @xmath8 bound states such as the @xmath9 .",
    "the nrqcd lagrangian also has an expansion in powers of @xmath10 .",
    "the momentum transfer in nrqcd is of order @xmath11 , so that the small expansion parameter in nrqcd is the velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the size of a term in the nrqcd lagrangian can be estimated using velocity counting rules  @xcite .",
    "the basic difference between hqet and nrqcd can be seen from the first two terms in the effective lagrangian , @xmath13 in hqet , the first term is of order @xmath14 , and the second term is of order @xmath15 , whereas in nrqcd both terms are of order @xmath16 . as a result , the quark propagator in hqet is @xmath17 , and in nrqcd it is @xmath18    the hqet / nrqcd lagrangian is computed in this paper to one loop and order @xmath1 .",
    "only the terms bilinear in fermions are considered here .",
    "there are also four - quark operators in the effective lagrangian .",
    "their coefficients are order @xmath19 , and can be obtained simply from tree - level matching .",
    "the hqet effective theory matching computation is a straightforward generalization of known results to order @xmath20@xcite .",
    "one can compute diagrams in the full and effective theories , and match to a given order in @xmath10 . since the hqet propagator is @xmath2 independent",
    ", the hqet power counting is manifest  one counts powers of @xmath10 directly from the vertex factors .",
    "this means that graphs with a vertex of order @xmath21 do not make any contributions to terms of order @xmath22 , with @xmath23 to any order in the loop expansion .",
    "the use of nrqcd as an effective field theory is more subtle .",
    "nrqcd with the propagator eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) can not be used as an effective lagrangian to compute matching corrections , since the velocity power counting breaks down .",
    "the matching conditions for nrqcd should be computed using the hqet power counting , by expanding in @xmath24 .",
    "after the hqet lagrangian has been computed , it can be used for computing bound state properties using the nrqcd velocity power counting rules . in other words , the nrqcd propagator eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) should be thought of as the infinite series @xmath25 where one uses the right hand side inside any ultraviolet divergent feynman graph .",
    "this is necessary when a cutoff such as dimensional regularization is used to regulate the feynman graphs .",
    "nrqed matching conditions have previously been computed using a momentum space cutoff  @xcite . in this case",
    ", there is no difference between using the left or right hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "however , a momentum space cutoff can not be used in nrqcd , since it breaks gauge invariance .    the difference between using the two forms of eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) in a loop graph can be illustrated by a simple example .",
    "consider the integral @xmath26 a typical nrqcd loop integral has the form eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "the power @xmath27 increases as one considers more and more divergent loop graphs in the effective theory .",
    "the denominator of a typical nrqcd loop graph has poles at @xmath28 , where @xmath3 is the external momentum , _ and _ at @xmath29 where @xmath2 is the quark mass .",
    "thus the scales @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) can be taken to be of order @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "one can see immediately that the nrqcd power counting breaks down .",
    "loop graphs with insertions of higher dimension operators are divergent , and can be proportional to positive powers of @xmath2 because of the @xmath32 term in eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "the positive powers of @xmath2 from the loop integral can compensate for inverse powers of @xmath2 in the coefficient , and the entire effective lagrangian expansion breaks down .",
    "now consider the same integral , but first expand @xmath33 evaluate the integral , and then resum the series .",
    "the answer is @xmath34 the integral is missing the @xmath32 term since it is non - analytic at the origin for @xmath35 , which is where the integral is evaluated in @xmath36 dimensions . equation  ( [ a5 ] ) only has inverse powers of the high momentum scale @xmath37 , and leads to an acceptable effective field theory .",
    "thus nrqcd and hqet matching conditions are computed in the same way , and the two lagrangians are the same .",
    "the continuum nrqed effective lagrangian at one - loop has previously been computed  @xcite using a photon mass to regulated the infrared divergences , and a momentum space cutoff .",
    "this procedure can not be used in a non - abelian gauge theory such as qcd .",
    "the kinetic terms in the nrqcd lagrangian at one - loop have previously been computed by morningstar  @xcite using a lattice regulator .",
    "the computations in this letter will be done in the continuum using dimensional regularization for the infrared and ultraviolet divergences , and for on - shell external states .",
