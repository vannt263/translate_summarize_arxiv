    "dwarf novae are a group of cataclysmic variable stars that consist of a white dwarf ( primary ) and a late - type star ( secondary ) ( for a review , see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital periods of the majority of dwarf novae are below 9 hours @xcite .",
    "the secondary star fills its roche lobe , transferring gas into the primary roche lobe via the inner lagrangian point ( l1 ) .",
    "this process results in formation of an accretion disk around the primary .",
    "the accretion disk plays the main role in dwarf nova outbursts which are driven by the thermal limit - cycle instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are one subclass of dwarf novae , whose orbital periods are shorter than 2 hours except for a few systems ( for a review , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these systems exhibit two types of outbursts .",
    "one is normal outburst , whose duration is typically a few days .",
    "the other is superoutburst , whose duration is longer than 10 days and their maximum magnitude is @xmath50.5 mag brighter than that of normal outburst . during the superoutburst , the light curve shows tooth - like modulations called superhump with an amplitude of @xmath50.2 mag .",
    "the period of the superhump ( @xmath2 ) is a few percent longer than those of the orbital period ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this slightly longer periodicity and the modulations are attributed to phase - dependent removal of the angular momentum in a tidally deformed eccentric disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the mean superhump periods , the fractional superhump excess , and the duration of the plateau stage are quite a typical for the `` textbook '' su uma - type dwarf novae @xcite .",

    "the data include 229 negative observations and 104 positive observations from 2005 june to 2008 april .",
    "although the short baseline of the archival data and its faintness even at the maximum brightness can not give a convincing result as to whether some outbursts had been missed , we detected six outbursts in total .",
    "figure [ longlc ] shows the long - term light curves of nsv 4838 .",
    "if we missed no superoutbursts , an estimated supercycle of nsv 4838 is about 340 days , which is a typical value for su uma - type dwarf novae . on the other hand ,",
    "the total number of the recorded normal outburst is too small for the estimated supercycle of nsv 4838 @xcite .",
    "one possibility may be that the faintness of its maximum magnitude of normal outburst prevented its detection .",
    "if we did not overlook any normal outbursts , the event ratio of the normal outburst to superoutburst is unusually small ( see .",
    "e.g. , table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "future continuous observations of this object are needed to clarify the activity of nsv 4838 .      according to an empirical relation of @xcite , the absolute magnitude of dwarf novae at the maximum of the _ normal outburst _",
    "is given as a function of its orbital period , @xmath38 where @xmath12 is in the unit of hour .",
    "according to multicolor photometry , the color index shows @xmath39 0 near the bright maximum @xcite .",
    "thus the maximum magnitude in @xmath16 band may be almost the same value as that in @xmath40 band . since no filter is close to @xmath40 , it is not unreasonable that we regard the magnitude in non - filter as that in @xmath16 band .",
    "extensive observations of su uma - type dwarf novae suggest that the maximum magnitude of the normal outburst is fainter than that of the superoutburst by about 0.5 mag ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in conjunction with the above facts including figure [ longlc ] , a maximum magnitude of normal outburst for nsv 4838",
    "is expected to be around 15.5 mag in @xmath16 band . using this value",
    ", we roughly estimated 1.1 kpc as a distance to nsv 4838 .",
    "the general consensus concerning the superhump period change is that the majority of su uma - type dwarf novae show a decrease in their superhump periods during superoutburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that this is possibly due to shrinkage of the disk radius , or consequence of mass depletion from the accretion disk .",
    "recently , it has been recognized that some su uma - type dwarf novae show an increasing superhump period change during a plateau phase of superoutburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "so far , we have confirmed this increase for about 15 su uma - type dwarf novae , most of which have their superhump periods shorter than 0.065 days @xcite .",
    "based on the refined thermal - tidal instability model proposed by @xcite , the maximum radius during the superoutburst without a precursor is larger than that with a precursor .",
    "when the accretion disk reaches the tidal truncation radius ( the maximum radius ) at the onset of the outburst , the matter will be piled up at this radius , at which the stored matter works as a wall .",
    "the wall prevents the cooling wave from propagating inward because the continuous tidal dissipation at the tidal truncation radius urges matter to infall . in this case , no precursor is observed at the onset of the superoutburst . on the other hand , when the accretion disk does not reach the tidal truncation radius at the onset of the outburst , the cooling wave can propagate from the outermost annulus , which is observed as a rapid decline like a normal outburst .",
    "if the eccentricity of the accretion disk grows to some extent , the heating wave can again propagate from the outermost annulus , because the tidal torque enhancement supplies the gas to the inner annulus .",
    "this process is observed as a superoutburst with a precursor .",
    "recently , @xcite studied superhump period changes for the 2001 and 2004 superoutbursts of a short period su uma - type dwarf nova tv crv .",
    "it was found that the 2001 superoutburst showed no evidence of a precursor and the superhump period increased during the plateau phase .",
    "on the other hand , the 2004 superoutburst was accompanied by a precursor and the superhump period kept almost constant during the plateau phase . in combination with this observations and the refined thermal - tidal instability model , @xcite suggested that enough propagation of the eccentric mode outside the 3:1 resonance radius may be observed as an increase in the superhump period .",
    "therefore , short period su uma - type dwarf novae , in which there exists a large annulus between the 3:1 resonance radius and tidal truncation radius , tend to show a positive period derivative . on the other hand , long period su uma - type dwarf novae and those with a precursor during superoutburst , in which the gap between the 3:1 resonance radius and the tidal truncation radius is small , tend to show negative or zero period derivatives .",
    "figure [ figure9 ] illustrates the @xmath41-@xmath2 diagram of su uma - type novae , in which we added the results of nsv 4838 .",
    "it should be noted that nsv 4838 showed the positive period derivatives despite the fact that the superhump period of the system is as long as 0.070 days . in figure",
    "[ figure9 ] , one can notice that a few systems of @xmath420.07 days also show the positive @xmath43 .",
    "such systems include vw crb ( @xmath2=0.07287 days , @xcite ) , tt boo ( @xmath2=0.07796 days , @xcite ) , and rz leo ( @xmath2=0.07853 days , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , these systems commonly show long - lasting ( exceeding 2 weeks ) , large - amplitude ( exceeding 6 mag ) superoutursts and long supercycles .",
    "on the other hand , nsv 4838 exhibits relatively a small amplitude ( @xmath444 mag ) magnitude is close to @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from this ,",
    "@xmath16 magnitude in quiescence may be around 18.8 , which corresponds to 3.7 in figure [ label1 ] . ] and a moderate supercycle ( @xmath441 year ) .",
    "in addition , the negative @xmath41 was reported in the 1991 october superoutburst of ef peg , which exhibited a long - lasting and large - amplitude superoutburst , as well as a long recurrence time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that these properties do not necessarily lead to the positive @xmath41 .",
    "although the exact mechanism causing superhump period changes still remains unknown , the present results imply that an additional physical parameter on the accretion disk should be required for explaining the observed diversity of the superhump period changes . in order to clarify the nature of the superhump period changes , we should collect further samples .",
    "in this paper , we present ccd photometry of the dwarf nova nsv 4838 during the 2005 june and 2007 february superoutbursts , as well as the long - term behavior of the system . during the 2007 february superoutburst ,",
