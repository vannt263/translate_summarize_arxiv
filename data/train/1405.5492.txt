    "hence we do not have natural dg algebras associated to @xmath0-angulations of surfaces , and the category equivalence of keller - yang @xcite is not established yet .",
    "fortunately , king - qiu s result @xcite on the hearts of @xmath9 together with the geometric realization of the @xmath107-cluster category of type @xmath2 by baur - marsh @xcite allows us to apply the framework of @xcite for our cases .",
