    "among the most fundamental models studied widely in applied mathematics and employed for the description of an extremely large variety of physical phenomena are nonlinear schrdinger ( nls )  equations @xcite .",
    "applications of nls equations have become even more prominent in recent years due to enormous theoretical and experimental progress that has taken place in studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and nonlinear optics @xcite . through the formal similarity between coherent matter waves and electromagnetic waves , research on these topics",
    "has become closely connected , and progress in one area frequently also benefits the other .",
    "the cross - fertilization between these two fields is extremely important not only from a theoretical perspective but also for applications .",
    "for example , coherent matter waves can be manipulated using devices such as atom chips @xcite whose design was initially suggested by previously - developed optical counterparts .    in the mean - field approximation , and at sufficiently low temperatures , the dynamics of matter waves are accurately modeled by a cubic nls equation incorporating an external potential . in this context , it is called the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite , @xmath4 is the atomic mass , @xmath5 is the macroscopic wave function of the condensate , normalized to the number of atoms @xmath6 ( so that @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the external potential , and the effective interaction constant is @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath0 is the _ s_-wave scattering length , and @xmath10 measures the density of the atomic gas @xcite .    the properties of becs  including their shape , collective nonlinear excitations ( such as solitons and vortices ) , and fluctuations above the mean - field level ",
    "are determined by the sign and magnitude of the scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , one of the key tools used in current studies of becs relies on adjusting @xmath0 ( and hence the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath11 defined above ) .",
    "a well - known way to achieve this goal is to tune an external magnetic field in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use a feshbach resonance induced by an optical @xcite or dc electric @xcite field . in low - dimensional settings",
    ", one can also tune the effective nonlinearity by changing the bec s transversal confinement olshani , napoli .",
    "adjusting the scattering length _ globally _",
    "( i.e. , modifying @xmath0 in a spatially uniform manner ) has been crucial to many experimental achievements , including the formation of molecular condensates molecule and probing the so - called bec - bcs crossover @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent theoretical studies have predicted that a spatially uniform but time - periodic modulation of the scattering length , with @xmath12 periodically changing its sign , can be used to stabilize attractive condensates in two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions and thus help to create robust matter - wave solitons @xcite .",
    "[ in the three - dimensional case , the feshbach resonance - based technique should be combined with a quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) periodic potential , known as an optical lattice ( ol ) . ] other nonlinear waves besides solitons have also been studied in this context . for example , it was predicted that spatially periodic or quasiperiodic 2d patterns resembling the classical faraday ripples in hydrodynamics can be excited in a bec via a nonlinear parametric resonance induced by the spatially - uniform and temporally - periodic modulation of @xmath0 ( but , in general , without changing the sign of @xmath0 ) @xcite .",

    "such spatial dependence of the scattering length , which can be implemented utilizing a spatially inhomogeneous external magnetic field in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance @xcite , renders the collisional dynamics inhomogeneous across the bec .",
    "condensates with a spatially inhomogeneous nonlinearity have recently attracted considerable attention , as they are relevant to many significant applications , including adiabatic compression of matter waves @xcite , bloch oscillations of matter - wave solitons @xcite , atom lasers @xcite , enhancement of transmittivity of matter waves through barriers @xcite , and the dynamics of matter waves in the presence of periodic or random spatial variations of the scattering length @xcite . additionally , while these works chiefly concentrated on quasi-1d condensates , studies in a quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) setting",
    "were also recently reported malspace ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a qualitatively similar model in a different physical context ) .    in the present work",
    ", we consider an effectively one - dimensional bec whose scattering length is subjected to a periodic variation : @xmath13 for some period @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the case of no zero crossings , so that @xmath3 always has the same sign .",
    "such a _ nonlinear lattice _ can be realized experimentally ( see , e.g. , the diagram in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and it offers various possibilities for the study of matter - wave solitons ( as discussed in refs .",
    "fka3,malspace , fka4 ) .",
    "here we focus on the dynamics of spatially extended states ( rather than solitons ) , which have not yet been considered in earlier works in the context of nonlinear lattices .",
    "extended states can be created experimentally , as has been done , for example , in the setting of a bec in an optical superlattice @xcite .    the analysis of the problem under consideration proceeds as follows .",
    "first , we apply a transformation to the quasi-1d gp equation with the nonlinearity coefficient periodically modulated in space in order to derive an effective gp equation with @xmath15 . with this transformation",
    ", the original inhomogeneity of @xmath3 is mapped into an effective linear potential taking the form of a modified superlattice .",
    "we consider spatially extended solutions of the transformed gp equation in the form of _ modulated amplitude waves _ ( maws ) , whose slow - amplitude dynamics we derive using an averaging method .",
    "these analytical considerations , presented in section ii , are followed in section iii by an investigation of the dynamics and stability of the maws using both direct numerical simulations of the original gp equation and fixed - point computations with the maws as numerically exact solutions .",
    "we thereby show that  on - site \" solutions , whose maxima correspond to maxima of the nonlinear lattice , tend to be more stable than  off - site \" solutions .",
    "we summarize our findings and present conclusions in section iv .",
    "we then discuss some technical details of the averaging procedure in an appendix ( section v ) .",
    "the 3d gp equation ( [ gpe ] ) can be reduced to an effectively 1d form provided the transverse dimensions of the bec are on the order of its healing length and its longitudinal dimension is much larger than the transverse ones @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the 1d approximation is derived by averaging eq .",

    "( [ nls3 ] ) , the same transformation defined above can be used ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) provided @xmath50 never vanishes .",
    "as is well known , the time - dependent coefficient in front of the nonlinear term is then translated into a linear dissipative term on the right - hand side of the equation for @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this term has the time - dependent coefficient @xmath52 . while this latter setting may be of interest in its own right ( perhaps especially when the dissipation coefficient is constant so that the time dependence can be completely factored out ",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the existence and stability of modulated amplitude waves ( maws ) in quasi - one - dimensional bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in  nonlinear lattices \" .",
    "in particular , we considered an experimentally feasible situation in which the condensate s @xmath227-wave scattering length is modulated periodically in space .",
    "accordingly , we analyzed the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation with a spatially periodic nonlinearity coefficient .",
    "we transformed this gp equation into a new gp equation with a constant nonlinearity coefficient and ( for small modulations of the scattering length ) an effective ( quasi-)superlattice potential .",
    "we subsequently studied spatially extended solutions by applying a coherent - structure ansatz to the latter equation , which leads to a nonlinear generalized ince equation governing the amplitude s spatial dynamics . in the small - amplitude limit , we used averaging to construct maw solutions , whose stability we examined using both direct numerical simulations of the original gp equation and fixed - point computations with the maws as numerically exact solutions .",
    "while direct simulations suggest stability of the constructed maw solutions for sufficiently weak periodic modulations , the fixed - point computations indicate that even those are weakly unstable ( though they can persist long enough to permit experimental observations ) for  off - site \" solutions , whose maxima do not coincide with maxima of the nonlinear lattice . on the other hand ,  on - site \" maw solutions are stable for much longer times even for large periodic modulations of the scattering length .",
    "this may render the latter solutions more straightforward to excite and sustain / observe in an experiment in comparison to the former ( even though both exist for wide regimes of the relevant parameters ) .",
    "the findings are consistent with recent theoretical work in @xcite on nls equations with a periodic potential and constant nonlinearity coefficient , suggesting that the results reported in that work can be extended to models with spatial modulation of the nonlinearity , such as the one studied in the present work .",
