    "theories of fully developed turbulence rely on the energy conservation in inviscid flows to derive the scaling laws of a turbulent system .",
    "however , energy is not the only quadratic invariant of the three dimensional ( 3d ) incompressible euler equation , there is also the helicity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the velocity field and @xmath4 is the vorticity field @xcite .",
    "helical motions are observed in a wide variety of geophysical flows , such as supercell convective storms which seem to owe their long life and stability to the helical nature of their circulation @xcite . in astrophysics",
    "it is well known that helicity plays a key role in the generation of large scale magnetic fields through dynamo action @xcite . in hydrodynamic isotropic and homogeneous turbulence , recent studies of flows with net helicity",
    "confirmed that there is a joint cascade of energy an helicity to smaller scales @xcite , as expected from theoretical arguments @xcite . in the case of non - helical flows ,",
    "velocity and vorticity tend to align locally creating patches of strong positive and negative helicities . in helical flows , helicity still fluctuates strongly around its mean value , both in space and time , creating locallized patches with helicity much larger or smaller than the mean .",
    "as helicity is not positive definite , the study of its turbulent fluctuations is difficult and has received less attention .",
    "the scaling laws followed by helical fluctuations are unclear , and few comparisons are available between helical and non - helical flows to understand their impact on the energy cascade .",
    "it has been proposed that helical structures may have an impact on the dynamics of turbulent flows as helical regions have the velocity and vorticity aligned , with a resulting quenching of the non - linear term in the navier - stokes equation @xcite .",
    "intermittency in the helicity flux has also been recently studied in numerical simulations @xcite , and the geometry of helical structures was considered using wavelet decompositions @xcite and minkowski functionals in the magnetohydrodynamic case @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use the the cancellation exponent @xcite to study the fast fluctuations of helicity in turbulent helical and non - helical flows .",
    "the cancellation exponent was introduced to study fast changes in sign of fields on arbitrarily small scales , and is based on the study of the inertial range scaling of a generalized partition function built on a signed measure . under some conditions ,",
    "it was shown to be related to the fractal dimension of structures in the flow and to the holdr exponent @xcite .",
    "it was used to characterize fluctuations in hydrodynamic turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic dynamos @xcite , as well as in two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence @xcite . in solar wind observations",
    "it was used to show that magnetic helicity is sign singular @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , no studies of helical fluctuations in hydrodynamic turbulence have been done using the cancellation exponent .",
    "we analyze data stemming from direct numerical simulations ( dnss ) of the navier - stokes equation in a three dimensional periodic box at large resolutions ( up to @xmath5 grid points ) with different external mechanical forcings . both helical and non - helical flows are considered .",
    "we find that helicity fluctuations are sign singular in both cases , and the scaling of helicity fluctuations seems to be independent of the net helicity of the flow .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a relation between the helicity cancellation exponent , the fractal dimension of helical structures and the first order scaling exponent of helicity .",
    "the cancellation exponent @xcite was introduced to characterize the behavior of measures that take both positive and negative values , and to quantify a form of singularity where changes in sign occur on arbitrarily small scales .",
    "we can introduce the cancellation exponent for the helicity considering a hierarchy @xmath6 of disjoint subsets of size @xmath7 covering the entire domain occupied by the fluid @xmath8 of size @xmath9 .",
    "for each scale @xmath7 , a signed measure of helicity is introduced as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the helicity density such that the total helicity is @xmath12 . since the normalization factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) is the integral of the absolute value of @xmath13 over the entire domain , the signed measure is bounded betwen @xmath14 and @xmath15 and can be interpreted as the difference between two probability measures , one for the positive component and another for the negative component of the helicity density . to study cancellations at a given length scale ,",
    "we build the partition function @xmath16 in the inertial range , the scaling law followed by the cancellations can be studied by fitting @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cancellation exponent .",
    "this exponent represents a quantitative measure of the cancellation efficiency .",
    "if such a scaling law exists and its range increases as the inertial range increases , the signed measure is called sign singular . in this case , changes in sign occur everywhere and in any scale considered in the limit of infinite reynolds number . on the other hand , for a smooth field @xmath19 .",
    "the data we use for the analysis stems from dns of the incompressible navier - stokes equation with constant mass density , @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the velocity field , @xmath23 is the pressure ( divided by the mass density ) , @xmath24 is the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath25 represents an external force that drives the turbulence .    for the analysis , we consider six numerical simulations at different reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions , with different forcing functions that inject either energy or both energy and helicity .",
    "the simulations are listed in table [ tab_tabla1 ] and described in more detail in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "spatial resolutions range from @xmath26 to @xmath5 grid points , with reynolds numbers @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 the rms velocity and @xmath9 the integral scale ) ranging form @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and taylor reynolds numbers @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the taylor scale ) ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "two forcing functions were considered : taylor - green ( tg ) forcing , which injects no helicity in the flow ( although helicity fluctuations around zero develop as a result of nonlinearities in the navier - stokes equation ) , and arnold - beltrami - childress ( abc ) forcing , which injects maximum ( positive ) helicity in the flow .",
    "the forcings were applied respectively in the shells in fourier space with wavenumber @xmath35 and 3 .",
    "all runs were continued for over ten turnover times after reaching the turbulent steady state . as a measure of the helicity content of each flow",

    "to study scaling laws of helicity fluctuations in the inertial range of helical and non - helical flows , we performed a signed measure analysis and computed the cancellation exponent @xmath18 for all runs .",

    "( [ eq : chi ] ) , this can be done by computing @xmath44 and fitting @xmath45 in the inertial range .    although a detailed analysis of the simulations can be found in @xcite , in fig .",
    "[ fig : espectros ] we show as a reference the energy spectrum of the two simulations at the larger reynolds numbers attained ( runs a3 and t3 ) .",
    "the spectra present a short inertial range followed by a bottleneck , as is usual in simulations of hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the runs also have a range with approximately constant energy flux , as well as a range of scales consistent with kolmogorov 4/5 law when third - order structure functions are computed . as usual , these ranges have slightly different extensions depending on the quantity studied , and it will be shown that the cancellation exponent shows a scaling range comprised betwen @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which correspond roughly to wavenumbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which is wider than but includes the inertial range of both runs . at the lower resolution ,",
    "the inertial range in the energy spectrum and flux , or in the third - order structure function , is shorter and harder to identify .",
    "[ fig : espectros ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : cancelacionp ] ( left ) shows the signed measure of helicity as a function of the scale for runs t1 , t2 , and t3 from top to bottom ( non - helical , with increasing reynolds numbers ) . as the reynolds number increases",
    ", a wider scaling range can be identified .",
    "the values obtained for the cancellation exponent are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 respectively for runs t1 , t2 , and t3 .",
    "the values obtained and the dependence with reynolds number support the idea that in the limit of vanishing viscosity , helicity fluctuations are sign singular , i.e. , that fast changes in sign of helicity occur everywhere in arbitrarily small scales in the flow .",
    "this result is consistent with helicity cascading towards small scales , and with observations of the helicity distribution being highly intermittent @xcite ( albeit the previous studies are only for flows with net helicity ) .        as mentioned earlier , the flows with abc forcing are helical . for such flows the direct cascade of helicity and its intermittency has been studied before using spectral quantities .",
    "although helicity fluctuations develop in these flows , given the predominant sign of helicity , fluctuations occur around the mean value and less changes in sign take place .",
    "indeed , if the signed measure of helicity and the cancellation exponent is computed for run a3 , we obtain @xmath53 .",
    "this smaller value of the exponent is consistent with the less cancellations , and the larger error is associated to the fact that larger fluctuations are observed in the signed measure as less events whith changes of sign are available .",
    "however , we are interested in helicity fluctuations around the mean value , and to correctly consider these fluctuations the mean value of helicity @xmath13 was subtracted from the helicity density in runs a1 , a2 , and a3 prior to the analysis .",
    "the resulting signed measures are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cancelacionp ] ( right ) . in this case",
    "we also observe scaling of @xmath44 expanding over a wider range of scales as the reynolds number increases , indicating that also for helical flows helicity fluctuations are sign singular .",
    "the results obtained for the helicity cancellations in helical and non - helical runs are similar .",
    "the cancellation exponents are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 respectively for runs a1 , a2 , and a3 . at the highest resolution three",
    "ranges can be identified in both the a3 and t3 runs . at the smaller scales ,",
    "viscous effects dominate and the flow is smooth .",
    "this results in less changes of sign in helicity and a shallower distribution of the signed measure .",
    "the slope tends to zero , as expected for a smooth flow , and the signed measure tends to one for the smallest resolved scale . at intermediate scales",
    "an inertial range is observed , and at larger scales the results are affected by the external forcing . in this scales , large fluctuations in the value of @xmath44 are observed as a result . as mentioned before , the inertial range of @xmath44 is wider than the inertial range observed in the energy spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with observations of the helicity spectrum decaying slower than the energy spectrum near the dissipative range in helical turbulence @xcite .",
    "the cancellation exponent obtained in all runs as a function of the taylor based reynolds number is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : kappa ] ( a ) .",
    "for both the helical and non - helical runs @xmath18 decreases with the reynolds number , and for the largest reynolds numbers studied the value of @xmath18 seems to saturate and is the same within error bars for both helical and non - helical flows .",
    "note that because of the different forcing functions , the helical and non - helical runs have slightly different reynolds numbers even when the same grid resolution is used .",
    "the similarities between the scaling laws of the helical and non - helical flows suggests that statistics of the helicity fluctuations are the same in both cases .",
    "this is further confirmed by a histogram of the helicity fluctuations around its mean value for the t3 and a3 runs . as fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] ( b ) shows , turbulent fluctuations of helicity are similar , with small differences on the tails .     as a function of the taylor based reynolds numbers for the helical ( triangles ) and the non - helical ( diamonds ) .",

    "helicity fluctuations are sign singular .",
    "the fast oscillations in sign point to a highly intermittent quantity that fluctuates rapidly in localized structures at arbitrarily small scales for infinite reynolds numbers .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the cancellation exponent can be related to the geometry of such structures , and under some conditions these relations can be rigorously derived @xcite .",
    "the relations can be found also using simple geometrical arguments . in the following , we extend the analysis of @xcite for the current density in magnetohydrodynamics to consider the case of kinetic helicity in hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "we assume the helicity is spatially correlated ( although not necessarily locally smoth ) in @xmath57 dimensions and uncorrelated in @xmath58 dimensions , where @xmath59 follows from the dimension of the space . with this choice",
    ", a correlated helicity distribution has @xmath60 , and a completely uncorrelated helicity distribution has @xmath61 . for intermediate cases",
    ", we can estimate the signed measure of helicity as follows @xmath62 where we used homogeneity to replace the sum over all subsets @xmath63 by @xmath64 ( the total number of terms in the sum ) times the integral over a generic box @xmath65 of size @xmath7 .",
    "since the absolute values in the denominator prevent any cancellation , the integral below was approximated by the characteristic value @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the rms value of the helicity density .    in the inertial range , and still under homogeneity asumptions , the helicity follows some scaling law which can be represented by helicity structure functions @xmath68 , where @xmath69 represents a lineal increment .",
    "we can then split the integral over the domain @xmath65 in integrals over subdomains with volume @xmath70 such that they separate the contributions from domains where the helicity is correlated of domains where the helicity is uncorrelated in space .",
    "then , the remaining integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fractal ] ) can be estimated as @xcite @xmath71 the uncorrelated dimensions give a value proportional to the square root of their volume @xmath72 .",
    "the correlated dimensions give a contribution proportional to @xmath73 , wich for @xmath74 ( locally smoth helicity ) is proporcional to their volume . replacing this results in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fractal ] ) , we get that the signed measure of helicity @xmath44 scales as @xmath75     of the slice is shown .",
    "left : contours with @xmath76 , i.e. , places where cancellations take place .",
    "right : contours with @xmath77 .",
    "note how contour levels of zero helicity fill the space , while white patches are observed in the contour levels of non - zero helicity , as well as filamentary structures.,width=529 ]    thus the cancellation exponent @xmath18 , the fractal dimension @xmath57 , and the scaling exponent @xmath78 are related through @xmath79 a completely smooth field ( @xmath60 ) has @xmath80 , in agreement with the definition of @xmath18 and of the first order ( hlder ) scaling exponent @xmath78 for the field ( see @xcite ) . in a turbulent flow , the global helicity",
    "is observed to follow kolmogorov scaling , and therefore we can assume @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "then from the value of @xmath82 it follows that helical structures are filamentary with fractal dimension @xmath83 , in good agreement with previous observations of helical vortex filaments @xcite . as an illustration , fig.[fig : filamentos ] shows a slice of the helicity density in the t3 run .",
    "filamentary structures can be identified , specially for the contour levels corresponding to large concentration of helicity .",
    "structures less elongated were confirmed to correspond to filaments that cross the slice perpendicularly .",
    "signed measures of helicity were calculated for turbulent flows with different reynolds numbers and helicity contents . for both helical and non - helical flows",
    "cancellation exponents were calculated , obtaining a value compatible with @xmath82 for helicity fluctuations for both cases at the largest reynolds number considered .",
    "the scaling range increases with the reynolds number , and the value of @xmath18 obtained indicates helicity is sign singular in the limit of infinite reynolds number .",
    "simple geometrical arguments were used to link the cancellation exponent @xmath18 to the fractal dimension @xmath57 of the structures . to do this we assumed a single scaling exponent @xmath78 for the lineal helical increments . assuming @xmath81 , a value consistent with numerical results , we obtain that helicity fluctuations are filamentary with fractal dimension of @xmath83 , also in agreement with observations .",
