    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is one of the essential components of galaxies because stars are born in and return to them .",
    "the ism is greatly influenced by massive stars due to their stellar winds and supernova after their death .",
    "therefore , the formation process of massive stars within the ism is crucial for understanding of the nature and evolution of galaxies . in the milky way galaxy ,",
    "a large fraction of the ism is in the form of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ; @xcite ) , and they are known to be major sites of massive star formation ( @xcite ) .    at this spatial scale , i.e. , a few tens to a hundred pc we can find a wide variety of star - formation activities and the nature of molecular clouds .",
    "for example , in the lmc , the variation in star - formation activity from cloud to cloud also becomes visible at this spatial scale , and it is interpreted as indicating different evolutionary stages of gmcs along the star formation processes ( @xcite ) . furthermore , no tight correlation between the molecular gas masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) can be found among gmcs in m33 seen at a scale of @xmath5100 pc or smaller ( @xcite ) , despite the fact that there exists a tight correlation between the molecular gas masses and sfrs at scales of a few thousand to a few hundred pc in galaxies , known as the kenicutt ",
    "schmidt law ( k - s law ; kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the reported breakdown of the k - s law in m33 is presumably due to the differences in the star - formation properties , i.e. , gmcs at different evolutionary stages ( @xcite ) . with @xmath5100-pc - scale observations of multitransition co lines ,",
    "the coexistence of gmcs in various evolutionary stages has also been reported within the supergiant hii region ngc 604 in m33 , suggesting that sequential star formation is on - going ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , a survey of gmcs at a spatial scale of @xmath5100 pc is essential for understanding of the processes of massive stars from the ism .",
    "in addition to this , an unbiased survey is also important because it can sample gmcs in various environments , i.e. , in the central region , outer region , spiral arms , inter - arm regions , etc .",
    "formations of gmcs , dense molecular gas , and massive stars will be affected not only by local processes within individual gmcs but also by these global structures of a galaxy or environments within a galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is also essential to understanding the nature and evolution of the ism , since the first phase of star formation process is the formation of a dense gas cloud from the diffuse ism .",
    "many studies of the transition from atomic to molecular gas have been conducted using both theoretical and observational approaches .",
    "@xcite introduced the molecular fraction @xmath8 as a parameter to quantify the transition .",
    "it is the ratio of the molecular gas surface density to the total gas surface density including both atomic and molecular gases .",
    "@xmath8 can be expressed as a function of metallicity , uv radiation field , and gas pressure .",
    "in particular , metallicity is considered to have a strong impact on the transition of a gas from atomic to molecular .",
    "observationally , the presence of a `` molecular front , '' i.e. , a sharp transition front from molecular to atomic , has been identified in some nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas occurs within a very narrow span along the galactic radius , and the variation in interstellar metallicity has been suggested to play a crucial role in this phase transition ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , these previous studies on the gas phase transition were based on observations at a resolution of a few hundred pc . it is important to understand the transformation process of the gas phase at the gmc scale , an essential spatial scale for the ism , in order to obtain a unified picture of the change in the ism from the diffuse atomic phase to massive stars .",
    "m33 is one of the nearest spiral galaxies in the local group ( @xmath10 = 840 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the proximity of m33 allows us to resolve the individual gmcs with the existing large - aperture single dishes . since m33 has a relatively small inclination angle of 51@xmath11 ( @xcite ) , we can obtain a comprehensive view of a galaxy .",
    "this is a key advantage for the study of the correlation between gmc properties and galactic structures such as spiral arms .",
    "there are many previous studies on the ism and star formation in m33 .",
    "whole - disk surveys of molecular gas in the @xmath2co ( @xmath3 ) line have been conducted with the bima interferometer ( @xcite ) and fcrao 14-m telescope ( @xcite ) , and @xcite combined the results of these data with observations with the 45-m telescope at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) toward a part of the disk . a partial mapping of @xmath2co ( @xmath12 ) has also been conducted with the iram 30-m telescope and a comparison between the co and hi distributions has been made ( @xcite ) .",
    "selected regions of m33 , such as the supergiant hii region ngc 604 , have also been mapped in @xmath2co ( @xmath3 ) lines using the ovro array ( @xcite , ) and nma ( @xcite ) , and @xmath2co ( @xmath3)/@xmath2co ( @xmath13 ) multitransition maps of ngc 604 have been presented using the nro 45-m and aste 10-m dishes ( @xcite ) .",
    "atomic gas ( hi ) in m33 has been studied with the vla and effesberg 100-m telescope ( @xcite ) , and the cold dust component has been mapped in the 1.1 mm ( aztec / aste ; @xcite ) and herschel spire bands ( 250500 @xmath14 m ; @xcite ) , showing a decline in cold dust temperature as a function of radius .    here",

    "wide - band digital autocorrelators ( ac ) were used to cover a velocity width of 1332 km s@xmath17 with a velocity resolution of 2.6 km s@xmath17 at 115.271204 ghz .",
    "we monitored a sio maser source irc+30021 with the five - points observation method using a 43-ghz sis receiver ( s40 ) every 1 h to check the pointing accuracy .",
    "note that the final map was made using data with pointing errors smaller than 7.5@xmath4 and with wind speeds lower than 10 m s@xmath17 to avoid the systematic intensity loss due to the pointing errors .",
    "the resultant total observation time was 136 h.    the observations were performed with the otf mapping technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "the `` scanning noise '' was removed by combining the horizontal and perpendicular scans using basket weaving .",
    "the data reductions were made with the otf reduction software package nostar , which was implemented by the nro . although the beam size of the telescope was 15@xmath4 , the spatial resolution of the final map was 19.3@xmath4 due to the grid spacing of 7.5@xmath4 .",
    "the rms noise levels in the velocity channel map with a velocity range of 2.6 km s@xmath17 and the total integrated intensity map were 130 mk and 1.6 k km s@xmath17 , respectively , in the main beam temperature scale .",
    "the noise level in the integrated intensity map corresponds to 9.6 @xmath21 in the beam size ( 80 pc ) by applying the galactic co - to - h@xmath22 conversion factor , 3 @xmath23 @xmath24 ( k km s@xmath17)@xmath17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this value corresponds to a limiting mass surface density of 15@xmath25pc@xmath26 , including a correction of he , and is much lower than the surface density of gmcs in the milky way , @xmath27pc@xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",

    "this figure reveals many clumps with a typical size of @xmath5100 pc , similar to that of gmcs in the milky way ( @xcite ) rather than that of giant molecular associations ( gmas ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are chains of such `` gmcs '' in the northern and southern spiral arms .",
    "note that most of the emission consists of such gmcs and no diffuse emission is seen in the map above the limiting mas surface density of 15 @xmath25pc@xmath26 .",
    "we see no concentration of co at the galactic center in this map , unlike in most molecule - rich galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "these properties are consistent with maps obtained by previous studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity field of the @xmath2co ( @xmath3 ) emission in figure  [ fig:2 ] is similar to that of hi emission ( @xcite ) , except for a few gmcs ( e.g. , gmcs located in the southern arm ) .",

    "they are de - projected considering the inclination of m33 .",
    "we found that the surface density of atomic gas is higher than that of molecular gas at all radii in this figure .",

    "( 2010 ) ; the molecular gas surface density at central kilopersec is higher than that of the atomic gas in their result , although overall tendency on h@xmath22 and hi radial distributions are similar to us .",
    "one of the possible causes for this discrepancy can be due to the lower atomic gas surface density estimated based on the only vla data without the correction of missing flux .",
    "the radial distribution of molecular gas surface density shows an overall decline , with two significant local peaks at the radii of 0.1 and 0.5 kpc . by contrast , the surface density of atomic gas is rather flat , although it shows several small peaks .",
    "the radial distribution of sfr is similar to that of molecular gas ; again , it shows a decline from the center to the outer part of the galaxy , and we also found four local peaks in the radial distribution of sfr , at radii of 0 , 0.5 , 1 , and 3 kpc from the center .",
    "the first two peaks near the center correspond to the local peaks in molecular and atomic gas surface densities .",
    "the third sfr peak at @xmath31 1 kpc is associated with a hi peak , but there is no corresponding co peak .",
    "as mentioned above ( section 3.2 ) , most of the molecular clouds are associated with local hi peaks in the outer regions , whereas no such clear correspondence can be found in the inner regions .",
    "this suggests that the process of transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is different in the outer and inner regions and that the process is more efficient in the inner region . to address the issue quantitatively",
    ", we derive the fraction of molecular gas to the total gas surface densities ( hi + h@xmath22 ) , @xmath8 , which is expressed as follows ( @xcite ) .    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the molecular and atomic gas surface densities , respectively .",

    "we found that the @xmath8 values range from @xmath350.1 to 0.6 , showing difference among gmcs .",
    "this figure also reveals that @xmath8 is higher in the inner region than the outer region .",
    "the radial distribution of @xmath8 ( figure  [ fig:6 ] ) also confirms this finding : it has two peaks near the center and at a radius of @xmath50.5 kpc , and decreases toward the outer regions .",
    "this suggests that molecular gas is formed more efficiently in the inner region . a sharp decrease in @xmath8",
    "is clearly seen around @xmath36 kpc , and we suggest that the molecular front ( sofue et al . 1995 ; honma et al .",
    "1995 ) exists in this region .",

    ", no correlation between h@xmath22 and sfr is seen due to differences in the evolutionary stages of the gmcs ( @xcite ) , and this figure also indicates no correlation between @xmath8 and sfr .",
    "it indicates that the fraction of molecular gas in each gmc is not affected by the current star forming activity .",
    "@xmath8 is determined by ism pressure ( @xmath37 ) , metallicity ( @xmath38 ) , and the uv radiation field ( @xmath39 ) ( @xcite ) . here , in hydrostatic equilibrium for gas and star disk , total midplane gas pressure",
    "is given as follows ( @xcite ) ;    @xmath40    @xmath41 and @xmath42 are velocity dispersions of gas and stars , respectively . assuming that the distributions of stars and gas are similar",
    ", @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "then , @xmath37 is proportional to the square of the gas surface density , @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , @xmath8 can be expressed as a function of @xmath46 for given @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows the correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath8 .",
    "the red , blue , and green dots indicate the measured data points at the inner ( @xmath47 1.5 kpc ) , intermediate ( 1.5 kpc @xmath48 3.0 kpc ) , and outer radii ( @xmath49 3.0 kpc ) , respectively .",
    "we find the presence of two sequences in the @xmath45@xmath8 correlation in this figure : one is the sequence that can be seen in the upper left part of the figure or in the inner region ( @xmath50 kpc ) , showing higher @xmath8 values with respect to a certain @xmath45 .",
    "the other sequence can be found at the lower right part of the figure , i.e. , in the outer region ( @xmath51 kpc ) of the galaxy , where lower @xmath8 values can be seen compared with the previous @xmath45@xmath8 sequence .",
    "this means that we find two distinct @xmath45 values for a certain @xmath8 value : i.e. , the @xmath45 for a given @xmath8 value is higher in the outer part of the galaxy than in the inner part for the same @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , for a given gas surface density , @xmath8 value is higher in the inner part than in the outer part .",
    "this causes high @xmath8 of gmcs in the inner region shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] .    here",
    "we investigate the possible causes for the existence of two sequences in the @xmath52 diagram .",
    "the first possibility is that molecular gas is formed more efficiently in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "another possibility is that we are overestimating the gas density in the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "dynamical effects such as shock compression due to spiral arms can also be a possible cause .",
    "these three possibilities are examined below .",
    "( 150mm,80mm)fig5.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)fig6.eps    ( 150mm,80mm)fig7.eps      here we discuss the first possibility .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath8 can be governed by the interstellar radiation field strength @xmath39 and metallicity @xmath38 .",
    "if the radiation field strength @xmath39 is constant over the whole radius , the observed higher @xmath8 value in the inner part of the galaxy can be explained by higher metallicity @xmath38 .",
    "for instance , the two observed sequences correspond to two distinct metallicities , i.e. , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , for the inner and outer parts , respectively , at @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58",
    ". here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the values of @xmath39 and @xmath38 in the solar neighborhood , respectively . in short , a difference in @xmath38 of a factor of two can explain the two observed sequences if @xmath39 is constant throughout the galaxy .",
    "in fact , an early observational study on the metallicity distribution in m33 ( @xcite ) suggests that there is a sharp increase in metallicity in the central @xmath152.4 kpc region .",
    "although the existence of a metallicity gradient within m33 is still under debate ( @xcite ) , we suggest that the existence of a difference in @xmath38 between the inner and outer parts of m33 is a plausible explanation for the presence of two sequences in the @xmath61 diagram .",
    "on the other hand , a difference in @xmath39 between the inner and outer parts is needed to explain the two sequences if we assume that @xmath38 is constant across the galaxy .",
    "for example , we suggest that @xmath58 and @xmath62 for the inner and outer parts , respectively , if @xmath56 at all radii .    is there any observational evidence for enhanced radiation field strength in the outer parts of m33 ?",
    "if the interstellar radiation field originates from massive stars , elevated star formation should be expected in the outer parts , but in reality , we see no such tendency , as shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "moreover , if this was the case , we could expect a smaller @xmath8 value for larger sfr , but again no such correlation is found ( right panel in figure  [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "it is possible for the strength of the interstellar radiation field to be determined by intermediate- and/or low - mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but again the strength of @xmath39 does not account for the observed tendency of @xmath8 ; a significant enhancement of @xmath39 by a factor of 5 is needed in the outer disk , which is inconsistent with the stellar distribution traced by k - band images . considering these facts , we suggest that differences in the radiation field strength is not the cause for the presence of two sequences in the @xmath61 diagram . for the first possibility , therefore , the two observed distinct sequences can be explained by differences in @xmath38 between the inner and outer parts .",
    "next , we discuss the possibility that we are overestimating @xmath45 in the outer part . in figure",
    "[ fig:7 ] , the value of the horizontal axis corresponds to the gas pressure , or volume density , @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath63 is given by the surface density @xmath45 multiplied by the scale height @xmath64 , and here we assume that @xmath64 is constant for all radii .",
    "therefore , if there is a difference in @xmath64 between the inner and outer parts of the galaxy , @xmath63 values should be modified accordingly .",
    "for instance , if @xmath64 is higher by a factor of 2 at the outer radii , @xmath63 should be lower by the same factor . in this case",
    ", the value of the horizontal axis in figure  [ fig:7 ] is overestimated by a factor of 2 and the true data points should be shifted to the left . if this is the case , the true @xmath52 correlation ( after correction for overestimation caused by the differences if @xmath64 ) will show just a single sequence .",
    "is there any observational support for differences in @xmath64 in m33 ?",
    "although no direct measurement of @xmath64 has been conducted for in m33 , it has been pointed out that @xmath64 is larger in the outer parts than in the inner region by a factor of two or more in the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we can not reject this scenario as a possible cause of the two observed sequences .",
    "it is worth noting that the variation in either metallicity or scale height is rather bimodal  not continuous .",
    "nir observations have revealed the existence of an @xmath65 stellar distribution ( or bulge ) with a scale length of @xmath66 or 2 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the putative bulge size of 2 kpc is close to the threshold of these two sequences ( @xmath51.5 kpc ) , leading to a speculation that the different environments in and outside the bulge are the cause of the bimodality of the correlation .",
    "another possibility is a dynamical effect such as a shock compression of ism due to spiral arms .",
    "for example , spiral density wave shocks may push the transition from warm neutral material to cold neutral atomic gas , or simply increased self - shielding to allow for the the formation of molecules .",
    "such perturbations may be weaker in the outer parts of galaxies owning to the decrease in the stellar density and shallower spiral potentials .",
    "we suggest that this is indeed another possibility , although it may not be a major driver of the observed two sequences , because the strength of the spiral density wave in m33 is very weak as mentioned in previous section .    in summary",
    ", we have three plausible explanations for the two observed sequences in the @xmath45@xmath8 diagram .",
    "the first is the enhanced molecular formation caused by higher metallicity in the inner parts of m33 .",
    "another is the idea that two sequences are observed because of differences in the scale height of the gas disk between the inner and outer parts of m33 , and the true @xmath52 diagram ( after correction for the overestimation of @xmath63 ) will show just a single correlation sequence .",
    "dynamical effects such as compression of ism due to spiral arms may also a possible cause .",
    "we performed all - disk mapping of @xmath2co ( @xmath3 ) in the nearby spiral galaxy m33 using the nro 45-m telescope .",
    "the observed area covers the central @xmath0 ( 7.3 kpc @xmath1 7.3 kpc ) of m33 , including most of the famous hii regions such as ngc 604 and ngc 595 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the resultant map is 19@xmath4.3 , corresponding to 81 pc , which is sufficient to identify each gmc in the disk .      1 .   the total integrated intensity map of @xmath2co ( @xmath3 ) emission shows a clumpy structure with a typical spatial scale of @xmath5100 pc , corresponding to gmcs .",
    "we find no diffuse , smoothly distributed components of molecular gas at this sensitivity .",
    "the overall distribution of molecular gas roughly agrees with that of hi ; that is , co emission coincides with the peaks of hi emission in general .",
    "however , close inspection of the co and hi maps suggests that not every co emission is associated with local hi peaks , particularly in the inner portions of the disk ( @xmath6 2 kpc ) , although most of the co emission is located at the local hi peaks in the outer parts .",
    "we find that most of the uncovered gmcs are accompanied by massive star - forming regions , although the sfrs vary widely from cloud to cloud .",
    "the azimuthally averaged hi gas surface density exhibits a flat radial distribution .",
    "however , the co radial distribution shows a significant enhancement within the central 12 kpc region , which is very similar to that of the sfr .",
    "we find that hi is the dominant component compared with co at all radii .",
    "we obtained a map of molecular fraction , @xmath67 , at a 100-pc resolution .",
    "this is the first such map covering an entire galaxy at gmc - scale resolution .",
    "we find that @xmath8 tends to be high in the inner region .",
    "the correlation between @xmath8 and gas surface density was investigated .",
    "we found two distinct sequences in the correlation .",
    "the presence of two correlation sequences can be explained by differences in metallicity , i.e. , higher metallicity in the central region ( @xmath9 1.5 kpc ) than in the outer parts ( a factor of @xmath52 ) .",
    "alternatively , differences in scale height can also account for the two observed sequences , i.e. , increased scale height toward the outer disk .",

    "<S> the overall distribution of molecular gas roughly agrees with that of hi . </S>",
    "<S> however , closer inspection of the co and hi maps suggests that not every co emission is associated with local hi peaks , particularly in the inner portion of the disk ( @xmath6 2 kpc ) , although most of co emission is located at the local hi peaks in the outer radii . </S>",
    "<S> we found that most uncovered gmcs are accompanied by massive star - forming regions , although the star formation rates ( sfrs ) vary widely from cloud to cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthally averaged hi gas surface density exhibits a flat radial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , the co radial distribution shows a significant enhancement within the central 12 kpc region , which is very similar to that of the sfr . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a map of the molecular fraction , @xmath7 , at a 100-pc resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first @xmath8 map covering an entire galaxy with a gmc - scale resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath8 tends to be high near the center . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between @xmath8 and gas surface density shows two distinct sequences . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of two correlation sequences can be explained by differences in metallicity , i.e. , higher ( @xmath52-fold ) metallicity in the central region ( @xmath9 1.5 kpc ) than in the outer parts . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , differences in scale height can also account for the two sequences , i.e. , increased scale height toward the outer disk . </S>"
