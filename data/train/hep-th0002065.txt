    "over the last few years , following the pioneering ideas of ghoshal and zamolodchikov , and others @xcite , much work has been done to investigate integrable quantum field theory with a boundary . in particular , the affine toda field theories have offered a surprisingly rich structure which is just beginning to be understood .",
    "the classical affine toda field theories are known to remain integrable in the presence of certain ( generally quite restricted ) boundary conditions confining them to a half - line , or to an interval @xcite .",
    "the corresponding quantum field theories are hardly explored although there has been progress in certain cases associated with the @xmath4 class of models @xcite .",
    "the first of these ( @xmath5 ) is the sinh - gordon model and , unlike all the others has a set of integrable boundary conditions depending on a pair of extra parameters , the so - called boundary parameters .",
    "however , even in this case , it remains to be seen precisely how the two boundary parameters influence quantities of interest such as the reflection factor .",
    "the sinh - gordon model is related to the sine - gordon model and its reflection factors are related to the reflection factors of the lightest breather in the sine - gordon model .",
    "indeed , the results obtained by ghoshal and zamolodchikov @xcite allow a determination of the general form of the sinh - gordon reflection factor and this is a very useful piece of information .",
    "however , apart from two special cases ( neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions ) ghoshal and zamolodchikov s formulae fail to provide a relationship between the reflection factors and the boundary parameters themselves which appear as the data in a lagrangian formulation of the model",
    ".    recently , it was noticed @xcite that for certain ranges of the boundary parameters in the sinh - gordon model there are real periodic classical finite - energy solutions called boundary breathers .",
    "the sinh - gordon model has no real finite - energy solutions at all on the whole line ( other than @xmath6 ) but , once there is a boundary singularities may be hidden behind it allowing solutions restricted to a half - line to have finite energy .",
    "the existence of periodic solutions allows a semi - classical quantization determining the spectrum of boundary bound states .",
    "once the spectrum of bound state energies is known it may be compared with a boundary bootstrap calculation of the energies of the same states and hence may be used , in principle , to find a relationship between the lagrangian boundary parameters and the data in ghoshal s formula . in fact",
    "this is complicated and was carried out in @xcite for the simpler situation in which the two boundary parameters are equal and the @xmath7 symmetry of the bulk theory is preserved .",
    "the corresponding calculation in the more general case is not yet completed .",
    "the semi - classical calculation may turn out to be exact ( as it did for the energy spectrum of the breathers in the bulk sine - gordon model itself ; for a review see @xcite ) but , failing a proof of exactness the results may be checked against low - order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "if the two boundary parameters are different and the @xmath8 symmetry is broken , the perturbation theory becomes substantially more complicated : the lowest energy static background is no longer the configuration @xmath9 and therefore the perturbation theory must be developed within a non - trivial background , leading to additional cubic and higher odd order couplings as well as a substantially more intricate propagator .",
    "nevertheless , as will be shown below , provided calculations are restricted to first order in the difference of the two boundary parameters , some of the complications disappear and we are able to calculate the correction to the reflection factor at one loop .",
    "the result we obtain is consistent with a conjecture for the relationship between the boundary parameters and ghoshal s formula in the more general setting . a full discussion , to all orders in the difference of the boundary parameters , even at one loop order in the bulk coupling ,",
    "must be postponed .",
    "the sinh - gordon theory corresponds to the affine toda field theory associated with @xmath10 .",
    "the bulk lagrangian density of the theory is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 the real constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 provide a mass scale and a coupling constant , respectively , and it is customary in affine toda field theory to choose @xmath15 .    assuming two sinh - gordon particles of relative rapidity @xmath16 scatter from each other elastically , the bulk s - matrix characterizing this process is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and the symbol @xmath19 denotes the hyperbolic building block : @xmath20 the s - matrix is invariant under the following weak - strong coupling transformation    @xmath21    a property known as weak - strong coupling duality .",
    "a sinh - gordon theory on the half - line is described by the following lagrangian density :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is regarded as a functional of the field only , not its time derivative . moreover ,",
    "the generic form of @xmath23 is given by @xcite @xmath24 note , the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 are a pair of real numbers , essentially free ( but see @xcite ) , which represent the extra parameters permitted at the boundary @xmath27 .",
    "the equation of motion and the boundary condition for the sinh - gordon model on the half - line become ( after rescaling the mass scale to unity ) : @xmath28 @xmath29",
    "when a sinh - gordon particle is moving towards the boundary located at @xmath27 it will reflect elastically from it meaning that the in- and out- one particle states , conveniently labelled by rapidity , will be related by a reflection factor @xmath30    the general form of this reflection factor is known although its detailed dependence on the boundary parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 appearing in ( [ bboundary ] ) is known only in special cases .",
    "the sequence of arguments determining its form is somewhat indirect , stemming from the work of ghoshal and zamolodchikov @xcite as follows . solving the boundary yang - baxter equation , and using general constraints implementing unitarity and a form of crossing symmetry",
    ", it proved possible to calculate the reflection factor for the sine - gordon soliton . since breathers are soliton - anti - soliton bound states , a subsequent set of calculations using the boundary bootstrap led ghoshal @xcite to conjecture reflection factors for each member of the full tower of breathers .",
    "finally , the reflection factor for the lightest breather is supposed to be identical with that of the sinh - gordon particle provided the sine - gordon coupling @xmath14 is replaced by @xmath33 .",
    "thus , suitably transformed in the manner described , ghoshal s formula for the sinh - gordon reflection factor is given by : @xmath34 actually , ghoshal s notation was a little different and made use of two other quantities @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 .",
    "there are special cases in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 have been conjectured .",
    "for example , the neumann boundary condition which is defined by @xmath39 has been argued by ghoshal and zamolodchikov to need a reflection factor containing @xmath40    more recently @xcite , the boundary breather states of the sinh - gordon model restricted to a half - line were investigated and their energy spectrum calculated in two ways .",
    "first , by using the bootstrap equations , and then by finding a set of periodic finite - energy solutions which could be quantized using a wkb approximation . insisting that the two methods agreed with each other provided strong evidence for a relationship between the boundary parameters , the bulk coupling constant , and the parameters appearing in the reflection factor .",
    "for technical reasons this work was restricted to the case @xmath41 but , nevertheless , yielded an expression for @xmath37 , with @xmath42 . specifically , setting @xmath43 and restricting @xmath44 to the range @xmath45 , @xmath37 is given by , @xmath46 in the limit @xmath47 from above , this is in agreement with ( [ eneumann ] ) .    both of these conjectures are underpinned by low order perturbation theory .",
    "kim @xcite has calculated the one loop correction to the classical neumann boundary condition reflection factor and found agreement with ghoshal s formula to @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "a more general calculation was carried out , also to one loop , agreeing with the conjecture ( [ esimple ] ) , and indeed , preceding it @xcite .",
    "in fact , the perturbative calculation in @xcite agrees with ( [ esimple ] ) for @xmath44 in the range @xmath49 .    however , when @xmath50 the situation becomes much more complicated .",
    "indeed , all that is known up to now is the behaviour of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the limit @xmath51 , deduced from a direct calculation of the classical reflection factor in the general case @xcite . to describe this limit",
    "it is convenient to set @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "then , @xmath55 and , the classical reflection factor itself is given in term of the basic factors ( [ block ] ) by @xmath56    the expression ( [ kclassical ] ) is an essential ingredient of the basic two - point function , or propagator , which takes the form @xcite , @xmath57 where @xmath58 the parameter @xmath59 enters the static background @xmath60 and determines the point at which the background becomes singular .",
    "for this reason , it is crucial that @xmath61 .",
    "actually , @xmath59 is determined by the boundary condition ( [ bcondition ] ) and satisfies @xmath62 on the understanding that @xmath63 , it is enough to consider this situation since ( [ bcondition ] ) is symmetric under @xmath8 and the interchange of @xmath31 with @xmath32 .    in the expression ( [ propagator ] ) for the propagator , the classical reflection factor appears as the coefficient of the reflection part of the free field two - point function calculated within the classical static background . to check ghoshal s formula ,",
    "the strategy introduced by kim @xcite and developed in @xcite is to calculate perturbative corrections to the two - point function and then to identify corrections to the classical reflection factor by picking out the coefficient of @xmath64",
    "previously , as noted above , the first order perturbation calculation was achieved for the specially symmetric case @xmath41 . in this section , this restriction will be relaxed and enough of the ingredients of the perturbation expansion will be calculated to allow a calculation ( in principle ) up to @xmath65 .",
    "we will discover that generally the theory needs three- and four- point couplings which depend upon the @xmath66-dependent static background .",
    "expanding the bulk potential ( [ vbulk ] ) around the background solution to the equation of motion , @xmath67 , we derive the three- and four - point couplings :    @xmath68    and @xmath69    on the other hand , the static background is ( [ background ] ) .",
    "so , after some manipulation , we have @xmath70 and @xmath71    in the same manner , using ( [ bboundary ] ) we can derive the three- and four - point couplings associated with the boundary term : @xmath72 and @xmath73    for future reference , it will be useful to know these to first order in the difference of the two boundary parameters @xmath74 : @xmath75 @xmath76 and similarly , @xmath77",
    "@xmath78    we shall also need the expressions for @xmath79 ( [ fdef ] ) and the classical reflection factor @xmath80 ( [ kclassical ] ) to the same order in @xmath81 since both contribute to the propagator ( [ propagator ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath82 and the classical reflection factor ( [ kclassical ] ) reduces to @xmath83 it is also convenient to write @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the classical reflection factor when the two boundary parameters are equal .    to calculate quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor at one loop order we use perturbative methods generalised to the affine toda field theory on a half - line @xcite .",
    "( for earlier references on boundary perturbation theory in general see;@xcite for affine toda perturbation theory see @xcite , or the review @xcite . )",
    "the @xmath48 correction to @xmath86 has been calculated before and the purpose of this article is to calculate the corrections to @xmath87 to the same order .",
    "the possible diagrams to @xmath48 are :        i ii iii    figure 1 : three basic feynman diagrams in one loop order .",
    "these will be computed in configuration space noting that each vertex may either be situated at the boundary or within the bulk . in effect , there are ten contributions which need to be calculated .    however , there is a simplifying feature provided we are content to work to first order in @xmath81 .",
    "to recognise this it is enough to note that because the three - point coupling is already @xmath88 , implying the type ii and iii diagrams involve @xmath89 , only diagrams of type i need concern us .",
    "thus , there are two contributions which need to be calculated in order to be able to deduce the quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor , both of type i. the first is directly related to the boundary , when the interaction vertex coincides with the boundary , and it takes the form @xmath90 including the correct coupling constant and combinatorial factors .",
    "the second contribution refers to the bulk potential which means the interaction vertex is located inside the bulk region @xmath91 .",
    "this contribution is given by @xmath92 again , the combinatorial factor has been included .",
    "let us first calculate the boundary contribution ( [ bbubble ] ) .",
    "the loop propagator is given to @xmath88 by @xmath93 where we have defined @xmath94    note , the integral is clearly divergent but the divergence is removed by a renormalization of the boundary parameter . in effect , rearranging the part of the integrand containing the offending terms as follows , @xmath95 and making a minimal subtraction of the divergent portion , ( i.e. deleting the ` 2 ' ) , renders the integral finite .",
    "the part of the integral independent of @xmath81 has been calculated before @xcite , therefore we may write , @xmath96 and concentrate on the @xmath88 part .    as far as the remaining integral is concerned ,",
    "focusing on the energy variable and closing the integration contour in the upper half - plane , we encounter a simple pole at @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , we need to evaluate @xmath98 the @xmath99 integration may be performed by closing the contour in the upper ( lower ) half - plane depending on whether @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) . however , because of the branch points at @xmath102 it is convenient to locate the associated branch cuts along the imaginary axis from @xmath102 to @xmath103 . evaluating the integral and assembling the pieces , we obtain @xmath104    at this stage , the contribution to ( [ bbubble ] ) is @xmath105 the integration over @xmath106 ensures energy conservation at the interaction vertex and creates a dirac delta function which immediately removes one of the energy variables , for example @xmath107 .",
    "the remaining integral over the momenta @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be performed by completing the contours in the upper half - plane and taking into account the poles at @xmath110 . however , if @xmath100 it is evident that the expressions for @xmath86 and @xmath87 have no poles inside the contour . if @xmath101 , there is an additional pole but its contribution turns out to be exponentially decreasing in the asymptotic region @xmath111 .",
    "finally , we obtain the boundary contribution ( [ bbubble ] ) in the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "next , we need to calculate the contribution ( [ vbubble ] ) which to @xmath88 is :    @xmath114    the integral over @xmath106 yields a delta function which replaces @xmath107 by @xmath115 . furthermore , to calculate the integration over @xmath116 ,",
    "it is convenient to use the following device @xmath117 where the small positive quantity @xmath118 will be taken to zero at the final stage of the calculations .",
    "the loop integral which corresponds to the middle propagator of ( [ vbubble ] ) , is obviously logarithmically divergent and this divergence will be removed by the infinite renormalization of the mass parameter in the bulk potential .",
    "so , after making the subtraction and integrating @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and as before concentrating on the @xmath88 piece , we obtain the contribution @xmath121    in order to evaluate the integral over @xmath122 , we encounter the following two types : @xmath123 and @xmath124 both of these may be performed by closing an appropriate contour in the upper half - plane ensuring that it runs around the branch cut located from @xmath125 to infinity along the imaginary axis .",
    "note , if @xmath100 , then there is no pole inside the contour ; however , if @xmath100 , there is an extra pole but its residue integrated over @xmath108 and @xmath109 will give a contribution vanishing in the limit @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 .",
    "for example , the integral ( [ typetwo ] ) evaluates to @xmath129    let us divide the bulk contribution ( [ bulk ] ) in two parts : @xmath130 containing integrals over @xmath122 of type ( [ typeone ] ) and @xmath131 whose @xmath122 integrations are of type ( [ typetwo ] ) . for both it is necessary , after performing the integration over @xmath120 , to do the @xmath108 and @xmath109 integrals via closing contours in the upper half - plane to pick up the poles at @xmath108 or @xmath132 .",
    "all other pole contributions lead to exponentially damped terms in the limit @xmath133 .",
    "after some manipulation , @xmath134 is found to be equal to @xmath135    notice that @xmath134 , in the last term inside the braces , depends on @xmath136 in a manner which potentially is very inconvenient for a comparison with ghoshal s formula .",
    "fortunately , this term will be canceled by a matching term in @xmath137 .",
    "after somewhat lengthier calculations , @xmath137 is given by @xmath138    assembling the @xmath88 part of ( [ bbubbleresult ] ) with ( [ bone ] ) and ( [ btwo ] ) we obtain , @xmath139 whence we can deduce the correction to the quantity @xmath87 in ( [ ksplit ] ) .",
    "explicitly , we have , @xmath140 the correction to @xmath86 which was calculated before in @xcite is , @xmath141 this completes the collection of ingredients we need .",
    "in this section , the corrections to the classical reflection factor calculated above will be compared with the formula of ghoshal quoted in ( [ ghoshalformula ] ) .    using ( [ ksplit ] ) , the relative correction to the classical reflection factor @xmath80 is given in terms of the corrections @xmath142 and @xmath143 by @xmath144 hence , using ( [ kone ] ) and ( [ kzero ] ) we have , @xmath145    on the other hand , ghoshal s formula ( [ ghoshalformula ] ) for the reflection factor up to one loop order is given by : @xmath146 where @xmath147 in calculating ( [ f ] ) we have made use of the expansions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 to @xmath48 : @xmath148 with @xmath149 since @xmath150 , we deduce that @xmath151 thence , expanding to @xmath88 , we find , @xmath152    comparing ( [ calculationfinished ] ) with ( [ expansion ] ) we see a pleasing similarity .",
    "in fact the two formulae are identical , to @xmath88 , provided we choose @xmath153 and @xmath154 suitably . in other words , we may deduce that @xmath155 and @xmath156 is proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "unfortunately , the calculation does not allow anything more detailed to be learned about @xmath154 .",
    "to do better would need a correction to the reflection factor to @xmath157 .",
    "the purpose of this calculation was to test a little more deeply the expression for the sinh - gordon particle reflection factor given in @xcite and to learn additional information concerning its dependence on the boundary parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the result of the investigation is gratifying because it agrees with alternative derivations of the reflection factor and it also agrees with the following conjecture .",
    "everything we have learned so far is consistent with quite simple expressions for @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath158 where the coupling constant dependence enters via the expression for @xmath159 given in ( [ b ] ) .",
    "similar expressions for these parameters have been arrived at via other arguments by zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "if ( [ conjecture ] ) is correct then the reflection factor is invariant under the interchange @xmath160 . in effect",
    ", this invariance restores the @xmath161 bulk symmetry which apparently was broken by the boundary condition and replaced by a symmetry under the simultaneous interchange of @xmath162 with @xmath163 and @xmath164 with @xmath165 .",
    "the reflection factor is also invariant if @xmath164 and/or @xmath165 is replaced by its negative , as it should be given the definitions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is consistent with what is known at the special value of the coupling constant , known as the ` free - fermion ' point in the sine - gordon model , where @xmath166 and the s - matrix is unity .",
    "there , the restrictions on the parameters in the reflection factor can be solved exactly and are in agreement with ( [ conjecture ] ) @xcite .",
    "note also , that with the expressions ( [ conjecture ] ) the reflection factor ( [ ghoshalformula ] ) has a weak - strong coupling symmetry matching the symmetry of the s - matrix under @xmath167 . to see this , note that setting @xmath168 defines a new triple of coupling constants with the property that @xmath169    if ( [ conjecture ] ) is correct , implying the duality symmetry ( [ duality ] ) , then we are faced with other puzzles . for example , it is known that the supersymmetric version of the sinh - gordon model is only integrable when restricted to a half - line with some very special boundary conditions ( either @xmath170 or , @xmath171 ) ( see @xcite ) , and this restriction would appear to be incompatible with a weak - strong coupling symmetry without modifying ( [ conjecture ] ) .    it is also known @xcite that the other affine toda field theories constructed from data in the @xmath172 series , when restricted to a half - line , allow only a finite number of possible boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , the @xmath173 or sinh - gordon model is apparently the only example within this series which allows continuous boundary parameters .",
    "expressions for the associated reflection factors for the other models are largely unknown but , it will be interesting to discover if they too can permit a duality symmetry in the presence of a boundary which will match the symmetry of their bulk s - matrices .",
