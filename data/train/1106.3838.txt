    "@xmath0 is played between two teams of agents .",

    "otherwise the spies have a strategy to prevent this for all time and we say the spies win @xmath0 . note that when the revolutionaries first form a number of meetings of size @xmath4 , the spies have one move to guard them all .",
    "if the spies succeed , the game continues ; otherwise , the revolutionaries win .",
    "continuous versions of this problem can also be considered .",
    "for example , one could play the game in the plane , where each agent has the power to move to points within euclidean distance @xmath13 from their current position . or the agents may move continuously at rates less than or equal to @xmath13 .",
    "these variants were suggested by beck @xcite .    there is a similarity between the moves in _ spies and revolutionaries _ and _ cops and robbers _ @xcite .",
    "the latter game is a pursuit game played by a cop and a robber on a graph @xmath1 : the cop chooses a vertex , then the robber chooses a vertex , and players move alternately starting with the cop .",
    "a move consists of either staying at one s present vertex or moving to an adjacent vertex ; each move is seen by both players .",
    "the cop wins if he manages to occupy the same vertex as the robber and the robber wins if he avoids this forever .",
