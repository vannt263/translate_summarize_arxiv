    "there have been recent large group experimental reports@xcite that neutrinos have been observed to travel at super - luminal speeds , i.e. at speeds faster than light in an approximately inertial frame of reference .",
    "the neutrinos were reported to travel at super - luminal speeds from cern in geneva to cngs in gran sasso .",
    "should the experimental assertions of super - luminal neutrino motion turn out to have sufficient verification , then important and deep theoretical understanding of relativistic physics will eventually accrue . our purpose is not to probe the detailed experimental procedures leading to reports of faster than light speed neutrinos . in what follows",
    ", we merely discuss the theoretical implications of such ultra - relativistic processes .",
    "let us first note within the context of quantum field theory , the fact that a neutrino moves in a super - luminal manner by no means implies a breakdown of the einstein special relativity or of lorentz invariance .",
    "it merely means that the experimental lorentz invariant quantities must be chosen with care .",
    "the neutrino moving between geneva to gran sasso is virtual as shown in the feynman diagram of fig.[fig1 ] in sec.[rvp ] .",
    "( i ) the lorentz invariant space - like displacement of the virtual neutrino is denoted by @xmath0 . from the data @xmath2 .",
    "( ii ) the lorentz invariant space - like momentum transfer carried by the virtual neutrino between geneva and gran sasso is denoted by @xmath1 . from the data @xmath3 .    in sec.[slv ]",
    "the special relativity kinematics of super - luminal velocities are discussed .",
    "the method of extracting the lorentz invariant space - like displacement @xmath0 from experimental data is provided .",
    "the particle reactions in geneva and in gran sasso are explored . in sec.[rvp ] the virtual neutrino between geneva and gran sasso are visualized .",
    "the virtual neutrino exchanges a lorentz invariant space - like virtual neutrino momentum transfer @xmath4 [ we use the metric @xmath5 , i.e. ( + 1,+1,+1,-1 ) ] .",
    "the method of extracting the lorentz invariant space - like @xmath1 from experimental data is provided . in sec.[nwf ] the nature of the quantum wave function of a virtual neutrino is explored .",
    "for a particle moving with velocity @xmath6 a sub - luminal velocity defines the lorentz invariant proper time of motion as @xmath7 for a particle moving at super - luminal velocities , the lorentz invariant proper space of motion is @xmath8      for a super - luminal velocity which is uniform in space and time , @xmath9 the lorentz invariant space - like displacement is as in eq.([slv3 ] ) ; i.e. @xmath10 while an experimental measurement of _ r _ and _ v _ depend on that lorentz frame of reference to be named the laboratory frame , the space - like displacement _",
    "l _ is independent of which lorentz frame of reference is chosen for a physics analysis .",
    "what is a bit more subtle is the analysis of the direction of time .",
    "it is well known that feynman@xcite analyzed the notion of a particle as going forward in time and an anti - particle as going backwards in time .",
    "if the particle goes space - like with a displacement _ l _ , as in eq.([slv4 ] ) , then in one lorentz frame the particle may go @xmath11 and in another lorentz frame the anti - particle may go @xmath12@xcite .",
    "for example , if an experimental group reports that a super - luminal neutrino went from geneva to gran sasso in some laboratory lorentz frame of reference , then in another lorentz frame of reference a super - luminal anti - neutrino went from gran sasso to geneva .",
    "there is simply no lorentz invariant way to time order space - like separated events .",
    "all of these considerations do not require that einstein be abandoned .",
    "one can in a relativistic invariant way simply quote the lorentz invariant space - like displacement _ l_. the reported super - luminal european neutrino or anti - neutrino transport asserts a space - like displacement of @xmath13 with values depending on laboratory distance scales @xmath14 and laboratory neutrino energy .",
    "it is crucially important to discuss these matters in terms of physical quantities which are lorentz invariants .",
    "sub - luminal particles are described in terms of lorentz invariant quantities such as mass _ m _ determined by @xmath15 .",
    "one should not forget that energy _",
    "e _ is merely one component of a four momentum @xmath16 . when particles or anti - particles are super - luminal , the four momentum definition perhaps becomes somewhat subtle but the requirement of a lorentz invariant description remains sacrosanct .",
    "consider the decay of an anti - pion into an anti - muon plus a muon neutrino , @xmath17 the neutrino is detected by a nuclear weak interaction via @xmath18 altogether , the reaction amounts to the creation of a muon pair changing the internal state of the nucleus _",
    "n _ ; i.e. @xmath19 there is no neutrino in eq.([slv8 ] ) because the neutrino is merely virtual . in a profound appendix b in a paper@xcite",
    "wherein feynman gave a derivation from quantum field theory of the diagram rules , he asserts that what looks real on a short time scale appears virtual on a long time scale .",
    "let us apply this discussion to the muon pair production eq.([slv8 ] ) with the @xmath20 in geneva and the @xmath21 in gran sasso .",
    "it appears clear that a neutrino or anti - neutrino had to make the cross country trip whether or not one considers such neutrino or anti - neutrino motions as real or virtual .",
    "let us first consider the neutrino or anti - neutrino four momentum _ p_. regarded as a real pion decay process in eq.([slv6 ] ) , the four momentum @xmath22 regarded as a real neutrino absorption in eq.([slv7 ] ) , the four momentum @xmath23 equating the above two expressions for the momentum _",
    "p _ yields the conservation of four momentum pair production eq.([slv8 ] ) for which @xmath24 while it is nice that four momentum in geneva + gran sasso is all conserved , that fact alone does not answer questions concerning a neutrino that no longer appears in the momentum balance .      for a classical",
    "_ real zero mass neutrino _ the four momentum obeys @xmath25 the velocity based on the classical hamilton equation @xmath26 thus , a classical zero mass particle moves at light speed .",
    "this no longer holds true in quantum mechanics wherein a zero mass particle can move off the light cone .",
    "the schwinger action@xcite corresponding to a massless neutrino source spinor @xmath27 reads @xmath28 wherein the zero mass spin one - half particle propagator @xmath29 obeys @xmath30 the one neutrino exchange amplitude for the particle interaction eq.([slv8 ] ) is then @xmath31 corresponding to the feynman diagram in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "solving eq.([qnp2 ] ) in the form @xmath32 yields the propagator @xmath33 obeying @xmath34 upon fourier transformation and with the feynman virtual particle boundary conditions @xmath35 with the notation for principal part left implicit , one may write @xmath36 .   \\label{qnp7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the neutrino four momentum in the diagram of fig.[fig1 ] is @xmath37 .",
    "note that the part of the propagator wherein the neutrino is off the energy shell , i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 , gives rise to motions on the light cone i.e. @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in detail , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 \\frac{d^4q}{(2\\pi ) ^4}=\\frac{\\delta((x - y)^2)}{4\\pi}= \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{qnp8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , the part of the propagator wherein the neutrino is on the energy shell , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 , gives rise to motions off the light cone i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in detail @xmath48 the uncertainty principle @xmath49 _ forbids _ the neutrino to be _ both _ on the energy shell @xmath50 and on the light cone @xmath51 .    from eqs.([qnp8 ] ) and ( [ qnp9 ] ) , it follows that neutrinos can move on the forward and backward light cones .",
    "it can move on time - like and space - like intervals .",
    "the quantum theory goes considerably beyond the classical causal retarded in time viewpoint employing the forward light cone @xmath52 the quantum propagator can be computed from the retarded propagator by an analytic continuation in the imaginary time domain @xmath53 the above method for computing acausal quantum propagation from classical causal propagation has wide validity@xcite .      for the neutrino exchange diagram in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "when employed in four momentum space , the virtual neutrino can have a space - like four momentum , @xmath54 so that the energy of a virtual neutrino @xmath55 or virtual anti - neutrino @xmath56 has the form @xmath57 the velocity of the virtual neutrino @xmath58 finally , @xmath59 typically@xcite the reported values of the lorentz invariants should read @xmath13 and @xmath60 in accordance with eqs.([slv5 ] ) and ( [ vnfm4 ] ) .",
    "in terms of the feynman scattering amplitude we may discuss the neutrino wave function @xmath61 . the neutrino wave function at space - time point _ x _ due to a source event at space - time point _",
    "y _ is given by the amplitude in fig.[fig1 ] or equivalently in eq.([qnp3 ] ) as @xmath62 employing eq.([qnp4 ] ) , the effective source @xmath63 and integrating eq.([nwf1 ] ) by parts yields @xmath64 note that the neutrino wave function obeys the massless dirac equation only away from the source ; i.e. invoking eq.([nwf2 ] ) , @xmath65 again leading to eq.([nwf3 ] ) .",
    "the reported super - luminal velocity neutrinos moving between geneva and gran sasso do not imply a breakdown of the special relativity considerations of conventional quantum field theory if the neutrino motion between geneva and gran sasso is regarded as being virtual .",
    "the two lorentz invariant quantities describing the virtual neutrino are as follows : ( i ) the space - like interval @xmath0 traveled by the virual neutrino is given by @xmath66 ( ii ) even for a massless neutrino , the four momentum of the neutrino can be space - like . thereby the lorentz invariant four momentum square obeys @xmath67 for the experimental reports at hand , the virtual neutrino travels @xmath2 with a momentum transfer of @xmath68 ."
