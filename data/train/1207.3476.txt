    "in 1958 p.w .  anderson @xcite suggested that sufficiently large impurities in a semi - conductor could lead to spatial localization of electrons , called anderson localization .",
    "the field has grown into a rich theory and is studied by both , the physics and the mathematics community .",
    "we consider the discrete random schrdinger operator on the integer lattice of dimension two @xmath1 and assume that the random variables @xmath2 are independent identically distributed with uniform distribution in @xmath3 $ ] , i.e.  each number in the interval is attained with equal probability .",
    "this operator describes the situation where the atoms of the crystal are located ` near ' the integer lattice points @xmath0 .",
    "many approaches to anderson localization are based on scaling theory .",
    "a dimensionless scaling parameter @xcite is the sole indicator whether or not the system exhibits anderson localization .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is the ratio between the heisenberg time ( the maximum time that a wave packet can travel inside a finite region before revisiting the same location ) and the thouless time ( the time it takes an extended state to arrive at the boundary of a finite region ) . roughly speaking , for @xmath5 we have localization , and otherwise the existence of extended states .",
    "our results are in contradiction with much numerical and experimental work using the scaling theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) which indicates that one should expect some `` marginal localization '' in the form of so - called quasi - extended states in dimension two for small disorder .    however , mathematically rigorous proofs for the dynamical localization of the discrete random schrdinger operator on @xmath6 are only known in dimension one at all strengths @xcite and in dimension two and higher for disorders @xmath7 above a certain threshold @xcite . for the discrete random schrdinger operator on @xmath6",
    "there is no proof , whether or not diffusion occurs in dimension two and higher for small disorder @xmath7 .",
    "many results are known for related operators , e.g.  the discrete random schrdinger operator on the tree and other structures .",
    "based on a recent mathematical result @xcite  which is based on the study of rank one perturbations ",
    "the author designed a new numerical approach to indicate conductance in random media .",
    "the key to making this method numerically feasible is that it suffices to track the evolution of just one vector under the repeated application of the random operator .",
    "the details of this numerical experiment , the mathematical background , and related information can be found in @xcite .    in section [ s - setup ] , we explain the idea behind the experiment and how it indicates that the discrete random schrdinger operator in two dimensions does in fact exhibit diffusion for small disorders @xmath8 with positive probability . via variations of the code",
    "we study the evolution over time of the energy of a wave packet initially located at the origin , as well as the dependency with respect to @xmath7 of the location of the energy of such a wave packet in section [ s - scaling ] .",
    "we show how those mathematical and numerical results are related to the thouless parameter , and conclude the existence of extended states in dimension two for small disorder .",
    "the method within can be applied to many operators from a larger class of discrete anderson models , so - called anderson - type hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the author expects a similar result for the discrete random schrdinger operator in dimension three and higher but has not investigated those cases .",
    "however , this method can not not ( yet ) be applied to two other important random hamiltonians : due to memory restrictions , the method is not suited well for the discrete random schrdinger operator on the tree . and",
    "the mathematical result can not be applied for the rademacher potential where the random variables attain the values @xmath9 with equal probability .",
    "consider the discrete random schrdinger operator @xmath10 on @xmath11 with identically distributed random variables @xmath12 with uniform distribution in @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "fix the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 , namely @xmath15    consider the distance @xmath16 between the unit vector @xmath17 and the subspace obtained by taking the span of the vectors @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , let @xmath19    deep mathematical results ( see corollary 3.3 of @xcite ) imply that dynamical delocalization takes place , if we can find a disorder @xmath20 for which the distance @xmath16 does not tend to zero as @xmath21 approaches @xmath22 , i.e.  @xmath23 where @xmath24    it is worth mentioning that this mathematical result is a ` one - sided ' implication . in particular , if @xmath25 , then we can not conclude localization .",
    "some fairly simple arithmetic shows that @xmath26 is given by the following expression @xmath27 where @xmath28 form the orthogonal basis of the linear subspace spanned by @xmath29 for @xmath30 of @xmath11 obtained by the gram ",
    "schmidt process ( without normalization ) , and @xmath31 denotes the euclidean norm .    in the numerical experiments , in order to exclude the possibility that the distance @xmath16 tends to zero logarithmically , we re - scaled time and applying the negative exponent to the horizontal axis which satisfied the least squares property for line approximation .",
    "the intersection @xmath32 of the approximating line with the vertical axis is an estimate for the distance @xmath26 .",
    "further we considered the lower estimate @xmath33 for @xmath32 obtained by taking the lowest @xmath34intercept lines through any two consecutive points .",
    "we repeated the experiment for many realizations of the random variable @xmath35 and chose the smallest values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 obtained from all randomizations .",
    "further , we considered a wide range of disorders @xmath7 .",
    "we include figure [ mainfigure ] ( see @xcite ) which shows these smallest values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 as a function of disorder @xmath7 .",
    "we show @xmath32 ( @xmath36 s ; larger function values ) and @xmath33 ( circles ; smaller function values ) .",
    "we conclude @xmath37 for @xmath38.,width=451 ]",
    "we explain how the delocalization result described in section [ s - setup ] implies the existence of extended states in the sense of the thouless criterion .",
    "the numerator @xmath39 in formula is precisely the @xmath40entry of the vector @xmath41 , while the denominator is the total energy of @xmath42 after successive orthogonalization ( we only consider the new information of each state ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the numerator is small often precisely if the heisenberg time is large , i.e.  it takes a long time to return to the same finite region . and",
    "if much of the energy of the state @xmath41 is located away from the origin , then the thouless time is small .      in the case of small @xmath7 ,",
    "figure [ f - energy2 ] ( see @xcite ) shows that most of the energy of @xmath41 is located ` away ' from the origin almost surely . in particular",
    ", @xmath39 is small often and @xmath41 is relatively large for all @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , a large part of the energy is almost surely located on the outermost diamond which the orthogonalization process leaves unchanged .",
    "in particular , the norm @xmath44 remains comparably large .",
    "this implies that the heisenberg time is large and the thouless time is small , yielding a scaling parameter @xmath45 and the existence of extended states ( in the physicists sense ) , i.e.  conductance of electrons .",
    "as was mentioned above , our method of computing a lower estimate of @xmath26 also indicates dynamical delocalization and hence the existence of extended states ( in the mathematical sense meaning states that do not decay exponentially , and even absolutely continuous spectrum ) .    as the disorder increases , figure [ f - energy2 ] shows that a larger part of the energy remains near the origin , so that @xmath39 is away from zero more often and the ratio @xmath46 is generally larger than for small @xmath7 .",
    "however , in this case a large part of the energy remains near the origin .",
    "the euclidean norm @xmath47 in the denominator of has little to do with the thouless time .",
    "therefore , the relationship between the ratio in formula and the scaling parameter is not directly obvious .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that our new method can not be used to show localization ."
