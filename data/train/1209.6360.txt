    "at the end of a star s life , low- to intermediate - mass stars return their mass to interstellar space by means of slow , dense winds @xcite during the agb phase .",
    "the material expelled from these evolved stars can take the form of irregular / regular patterns and shapes prior to mixing with the interstellar medium .",
    "the dense cses often show strong asymmetries in the late stellar evolutionary stages , whose origin probably lies in their progenitor systems .",
    "recent studies reveal that a binary system may play a crucial role in forming the various shapes of cses @xcite . however , the determination of the system properties of a wide binary is challenging .",
    "afgl 3068 is the first agb binary system that clearly shows a wide spiral pattern .",
    "two point - like sources in near - infrared images have been revealed using the keck adaptive optics @xcite , making afgl 3068 an evolved stellar system in which the binary components are indeed detected . based on a distance of 1kpc ,",
    "the projected separation is 109au , which is relatively large to infer a direct binary interaction .",
    "nevertheless , afgl 3068 exhibits evidence of a binary interaction in view of the large scale spiral pattern within its cse extending over 10,000 au in dust - scattered galactic light @xcite .",
    "this spiral pattern provides support for the role of a companion star in shaping the cse @xcite , necessitating an attempt to constrain binary properties from the large scale density pattern @xcite .    in a parameter study of hydrodynamical simulations on the asymmetric circumstellar pattern due to the binary motions (",
    "* hereafter ) , we have shown the directional dependence of the wind flow blown out from the agb star .",
    "it reflects the difference between the line - of - sight velocity of the flow and the propagation speed of the pattern in the plane of the sky . the pattern propagation speed is @xmath0 throughout the orbital plane , but equals to @xmath1 in the vertical direction , resulting in an overall oblate shape .",
    "this shape is characterized by the aspect ratio @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath3 , which appears as an ellipse with inclination .",
    "in addition , the maximum fluctuation of the gas velocity relative to the average wind velocity value @xmath1 is less than the orbital velocity @xmath4 of the mass - losing star .",
    "based on these findings , we propose a new method to constrain the binary properties from four observed quantities corresponding to the projected axial ratio @xmath5 , the projected binary separation @xmath6 , the position angle of the star from the major axis of the elliptical shape ( pa ) , and the arm spacing @xmath7 . here ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the separation of the agb star and its companion from the center of mass of the system .",
    "for the first application of this method , we place constraints on afgl 3068 , as an extreme carbon star @xcite , at the tip of the agb .",
    "figure[fig : a3068 ] shows the hst image of afgl 3068 , overlaid with our binary model with the mass ratio of 1.13 .",
    "figure[fig : chart ] is a schematic diagram summarizing the procedure of constraining the binary stellar and orbital properties , which takes @xmath4 and @xmath1 as two free parameters .",
    "consider an oblate spheroid given by the relation @xmath10 to describe the overall shape of the circumstellar pattern in a three - dimensional space .",
    "the determination of the projection is key in connecting the observed features to the binary properties .",
    "the projected shape of the oblate spheroid is obtained by coordinate transformation to the coordinate rotated with the inclination angle @xmath11 . defining the @xmath12-axis as the line of nodes ( i.e. , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) yields the elliptical shape in the projected plane as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which simplifies to @xmath18 hence",
    ", the orbital inclination can be estimated from the observed ( projected ) axial ratio , given the relation between the aspect ratio of the oblate spheroid and the orbital - to - wind velocity ratio , @xmath19 , as found from our parameter study in .    similarly , simple geometry yields the orbital separation of the binary stars ( @xmath20 ) as a function of the inclination @xmath11 .",
    "figure[fig : geome ] illustrates the inclined orbit with respect to the plane of the sky , and we obtain the projection effect for the orbital radius of a star to be given by @xmath21 and the same for the companion s orbital radius @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the true orbital separation can be obtained using the observed separation @xmath6 and position angle pa of the stars from @xmath22 and the inclination derived from equation ( [ eqn : incli ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the arm spacing @xmath23 of the spiral pattern in a binary system is determined by the product of the binary orbital period and the pattern propagation speed in the orbital plane : @xmath24 this equation shows that the orbital radius @xmath8 can be obtained from the pattern spacing @xmath23 along the observed longest axis , which refers to a section of the orbital plane , for a given velocity ratio @xmath25 . using @xmath20 and @xmath8 from equations ( [ eqn : separ ] ) and ( [ eqn : drarm ] ) , the binary mass ratio @xmath26",
    "corresponding to @xmath27 is determined .",
    "finally , we employ the formula for the force balance in a binary system , @xmath28 and replace the quantities related to the companion by the quantities of the mass - losing star using the definition of the @xmath29 factor , resulting in @xmath30 .",
    "the companion mass is @xmath31 .",
    "we first find the best fit of an elliptical shape with the dust scattered light pattern of afgl 3068 ( figure[fig : a3068](b ) ) .",
    "the modeled ellipse is characterized by an axial ratio @xmath5 of 1.1 with the major axis in 70  from the west ( i.e. , right ) . identifying the major axis as the line of nodes of the inclined orbital plane for the reference direction ,",
    "the position angle ( pa ) of two point - like sources arranged to the east - west direction is 70 .",
    "the observed separation between two sources @xmath6 is reported @xcite to be 109au(@xmath32/1kpc ) , and the interval between ellipses along the major axis , @xmath7 , is 2350au(@xmath32/1kpc ) , where @xmath32 refers to the object distance .",
    "the slight deviation from a very good match of the elliptical shape with most parts of the spiral pattern implies that partial circular ( or elliptical ) rings observed in other agb cses could also contribute to the spiral pattern driven by a binary motion .      for afgl 3068",
    ", we construct a parameter space , in which @xmath4 and @xmath1 are spanned , and follow the procedure summarized in figure[fig : chart ] to calculate the corresponding orbital properties of the binary system .",
    "figure[fig : degen ] shows the result , restricting the parameter space that satisfies the conditions for afgl 3068 as a carbon - rich agb star in a binary system .",
    "first , the gas velocity can not exceed @xmath33 in any direction , which yields @xmath34  with the line - of - sight velocity of 14  defined from the half width of spectral lines @xcite .",
    "second , the mass of a carbon star such as afgl 3068 is theoretically constrained to be less than 4  since more massive stars ( 4 to 8) are sufficiently hot at the base of their convective envelopes to activate the so - called `` hot bottom burning '' process , which significantly burns the envelope carbon @xcite .",
    "third , we take the lower limit of the carbon star as 0.6 , which is the mean mass of white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these three constraints place the afgl 3068 system within the gray - colored area in figure[fig : degen ] . as a result",
    ", the mass of the companion is constrained to be greater than 2.6  with the binary mass ratio @xmath26 greater than 0.2 .",
    "in addition , the inclination angle of the system is constrained to lie within approximately 4050 .",
    "finally , the orbital period is found to be less than 870 years , and the orbital speed of the carbon star in the range of 2.54 .",
    "assuming an accuracy of the distance measurement to be 20% , the companion mass is estimated to be greater than 2.1 to 3.2 .",
    "if the line - of - sight velocity of the wind is 16  @xcite , the estimated companion mass is larger than 2.8 or 4.2  at distance of 0.8 or 1.2kpc .",
    "the combination of a high wind velocity ( 16 ) and large distance ( 1.2kpc ) results in a large companion mass , leading to an implausible mass @xmath354 , for which the companion should have evolved more rapidly than the carbon star .    as more massive stars evolve more rapidly , the carbon star is likely to be more massive than its companion ( @xmath36 ) , although the mass ratio @xmath29 could be less than unity because the carbon star is in the phase of losing mass at a high rate ( @xmath37yr@xmath38 ) @xcite . in the case",
    "that the total mass lost from the carbon star is not too extensive , the parameters can be further constrained into a small parameter space , indicating individual stellar masses of 34 , speed of 2.53.5  with the orbital period of 700850 years in the plane inclined by approximately 50 .      within the limited area in the parameter space where afgl 3068 can lie",
    ", we select a point ( plus sign in figure[fig : degen ] ) to compare the corresponding hydrodynamic model with the observed pattern in the cse of afgl 3068 .",
    "figure[fig : a3068 ] indeed shows that the model shows good agreement with the scattered light image of afgl 3068 . in particular , the archimedes spiral characterized by having a constant spacing @xcite passes inside the intensity peak positions in the northerly direction , while the spiral of our model better traces the positions of the pattern .",
    "the blurred patterns seen in the northwest and south closely resemble the knotty structures appearing along the line of nodes , which form from the overlap of the two structures generated by the orbital motions of individual stars .",
    "the modeled binary system is characterized by a mass - losing star of mass @xmath39 , velocity @xmath40 , and orbital radius @xmath41au , and a companion of mass @xmath42 , velocity @xmath43 , and orbital radius @xmath44au .",
    "the wind velocity @xmath45 was set to be 10.9  at 30au distance from the mass - losing star .",
    "the gas flow evolves to a quasi - steady state fluctuating about 11.5  with a standard deviation of 0.67 . to achieve a temperature profile of @xmath46 as determined from an analysis of the co molecule excitation @xcite for a density profile of @xmath47 , the adiabatic index @xmath48 of the wind material",
    "is set to be 1.4 with the initial temperature of 1540k@xmath49 at 30au distance from the mass - losing star , where @xmath50 indicates the molecular weight .",
    "figure[fig : tempe ] shows that the resulting temperature profile indeed follows the expected power law with the index of @xmath51 and has an average value of approximately 60k@xmath49 .",
    "additional heating in the post - shock region and cooling via molecular line transitions are not considered as the timescales in the cses of agb stars are comparable @xcite .",
    "the density power law index is @xmath52 in the resulting configuration .",
    "the volume and column density contrasts correspond to a factor of 1030 and 25 , respectively .",
    "we note that the density contrast in the model with @xmath53 is approximately constant , while the contrast in an isothermal model decreases rapidly with distance from the system center .",
    "the dependencies of the overall shape and morphology of the spiral pattern on the orbital - to - wind velocity ratio are insensitive to the value of @xmath48 . the mass loss rate taken as @xmath54yr@xmath38   @xcite provides the scale for the magnitude of the density , but not the density contrast .",
    "the resulting column density toward the star is of order of @xmath55@xmath56 , which varies by a factor of a few with the inclination angle of the system .",
    "the observed pattern thickness of afgl 3068 is thinner than the arm thickness of the modeled column density distribution , and is rather comparable to the density distribution in the mid - plane of the sky . because of the curved geometry of the spiral - shell pattern , the shocked edges of the pattern at different layers are projected into different positions in the plane of the sky , resulting in a broader arm for the column density .",
    "it may imply that the observed dust scattered light is optically thick so that the observed image refers to only part of the pattern in the line of sight .",
    "this is consistent with the high optical depth derived from the spectral energy distribution fitting @xcite .",
    "the observed pattern thickness may also depend on the observed waveband .",
    "in particular , the size distribution of the dust grains may be affected , resulting from coagulation or shattering via grain - grain collisions immediately after encountering the shock with a velocity dispersion of a few  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the variation of the size distribution may affect the intensity across the shock pattern at the observed wavelength .",
    "small grains with a size less than 0.045   tend to strongly couple with the gas , while larger grains are characterized by a different distribution as they are more resistant to the drag force @xcite .",
    "the probable large population of small grains near the shock increases the scattering cross section with the large surface - to - volume ratio of the small grains , resulting in an increase of the scattered light intensity at the corresponding wavelengths .",
    "our model assumes circular motion of the binary stars . however , previous calculations for eccentric orbits do not show a noticeable change in the overall shape outside the second turn of the spiral pattern he07,rag11 , suggesting that our model for the large scale shape of the pattern driven by circular orbits is a good approximation even for the case of non - circular orbits .",
    "although a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath57 ) causing substructure in the inter - arm region ( prominent between the innermost turns ) may be responsible for the extra structure found in the observed image between first and second turns in the northwest and southeast , a circular orbit model also exhibits a weak density enhancement close to the observed substructure .",
    "this substructure can also possibly be affected by local phenomena around the companion ( e.g. , the formation of an accretion disk and radiation pressure effects ) .",
    "we have developed a new method to estimate the stellar and orbital characteristics of binary systems with an agb component using information gleaned from the properties of a spiral pattern in the cse .",
    "as a first application , we have provided constraints on the inclination angle , orbital period , and companion mass in the binary system afgl 3068 based on the pattern shape of afgl 3068 seen in dust scattered light . with molecular line observations , additional kinematic information on the velocity structure of the pattern",
    "will provide further constraints on the system properties .",
    "the potential for estimating system parameters with the method proposed in this paper is promising and can be useful in providing fundamental input about systems where asymmetries in cses are observed . as such one may be able to use these observational data to place constraints on the input parameters and prescriptions used for the evolution of systems in population synthesis studies of detached binary systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that the application of this method to other systems , which we can anticipate will be found with very sensitive and high resolution observations using e.g. , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array , will provide a greater statistical basis for determining the incidence of such evolved binary systems in the total stellar binary population .",
