    "heavy quarkonium such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 is an interesting probe to investigate the properties of the hot dense nuclear matter created by relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it originates from the idea that the suppression of quarkonium in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is the signature of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation  @xcite , and such a suppression has been measured in many experiments  @xcite . now the modification of quakonium yield is understood as the result of many different kinds of nuclear matter effects .",
    "they are classified into the cold and hot nuclear matter effects .",
    "the examples of the former effect are the nuclear ( anti-)shadowing , the cronin effect , the nuclear absorption , and so on .",
    "they mostly happen before quarkonium formation .",
    "the latters are thermal decay and regeneration both in qgp and in hadron gas  @xcite , which take place after the quarkonium formation .",
    "quarknoium is formed from the heavy quark pair produced in parton - parton hard collisions .",
    "the formation time of quarkonium is not short compared to the time for heavy quark pair production .",
    "it ranges from a few tenths to a couple of fermis , depending on model  @xcite .",
    "recently , the quarkonium formation time in qgp was calculated by using dispersion relations and heavy quark potential energies extracted from the lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd )  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the formation time increases with temperature and diverges near quarkonium dissociation temperature .",
    "it is reasonable because the size of quarkonium increases with temperature and the formation must take longer time .",
    "the temperature of the produced nuclear matter in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the top energy of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) or the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is much higher than the critical temperature for qgp phase transition and the qgp phase lasts for several fermis .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider the nuclear matter effect on heavy quark pair before it forms quarkonium in order to understand experimental data .",
    "the color evaporation model is a simple but successful method to calculate the cross section for quarkonium production  @xcite .",
    "it factorizes the initial production of heavy quark pair which is calculated in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) and the quarkonium formation from the pair which is nonperturbative .",
    "the latter is simplified such that a constant fraction of heavy quark pairs of which invariant mass is below continuum threshold forms a certain kind of quarkonium regardless of collision energy .    in this study , we apply the color evaporation model to the quarkonium formation in qgp .",
    "two modifications are made for this purpose : in the model the continuum threshold energy for open charms is twice d meson mass in vacuum . since d meson is supposed to be dissolved in qgp , we substitute the threshold energy by the sum of dressed charm and anticharm quark masses which is obtained by separating them infinitely in lqcd .",
    "the second modification is the heavy quark and heavy antiquark momentum distributions in qgp .",
    "the latter is not negligible if quarkonium formation time is long .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ cem ] , we briefly review the color evaporation model and modify it in qgp . we then describe charm and anticharm quark momentum distributions in qgp by using the pythia event generator and the langevin equation in sec .",
    "[ langevin ] . finally results and a summary are given in sec .",
    "[ results ] and [ summary ] respectively .",
    "quarkonium is produced in nucleon - nucleon collisions through a heavy quark pair production .",
    "because the production of heavy quark pair requires large energy - momentum transfer , it is calculated in pqcd as following : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the invariant mass of heavy quark pair ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the longitudinal momentum fractions of parton @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which produce a heavy quark pair , in parton distribution functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the parton distribution functions and the differential cross section for heavy quark production from partons both depend on the scale @xmath11 , while the differential cross section from nucleon scattering , which is a physical quantity , does not .",
    "once heavy quark pair produced , color evaporates from it to be a color - singlet state by emitting or absorbing soft gluons . through this nonperturbative process ,",
    "some pairs form bound states and the others turn to open heavy flavors . in the color evaporation model the cross sections for hidden and the open charm productions are respectively estimated by  @xcite @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bare charm quark mass and @xmath15 the d meson mass .",
    "the prefactors @xmath16 and @xmath17 are statistical probabilities for heavy quark pair to be a color singlet and a color octet respectively .    because it is not easy to measure all bound states in experiment , an additional constant factor",
    "is multiplied to compare the model with experimental data : @xmath18    the constant @xmath19 has a universal value regardless of collision energy whether in photoproduction or in hadronproduction  @xcite .    in this study , we apply the same evaporation model to the quarkonium production in qgp . because d meson is supposed to be dissolved in qgp , the @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ hidden ] ) is substituted by the sum of the dressed charm and anticharm quark masses which is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the potential energy between charm and anticharm quarks at temperature @xmath23 in qgp , and @xmath24 is the energy required to separate them infinitely . it is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ hidden ] ) , because @xmath25 in potential model .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ hidden ] )",
    "is generalized into    @xmath26        figure [ cmass ] shows the dressed charm quark mass from the free energy potential in lqcd  @xcite as a function of temperature .",
    "the bare charm quark mass and the critical temperature @xmath27 are taken to be 1.25 gev  @xcite and 170 mev respectively . solving the schrodinger equation with the free energy potential ,",
    "no bound state is found above 1.13 @xmath28 . as temperature increases ,",
    "the binding of charmonium becomes weak and the dressed charm quark mass decreases .",
    "the figure implies that the window for charmonium production becomes narrow in eq .",
    "( [ hidden2 ] ) as temperature increases , and it will suppress charmonium production at high temperature .",
    "while heavy quark pair is produced promptly by hard collision , it takes time for the pair to form a quarkonium .",
    "the time varies from several tenths to a couple of fermis , depending on model  @xcite .",
    "recently the formation time of quarkonium in qgp is calculated by using dispersion relations and heavy quark potential energies extracted from lqcd  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the formation time increases with temperature and diverges near the dissociation temperature of quarkonium .     in qgp as a function of temperature with the free energy from lqcd being taken for the potential energy.,width=9 ]    figure [ tform ] shows the formation time of @xmath1 in qgp with the free energy from lqcd being taken for the potential energy between charm quark pair .",
    "the formation time is about 0.6 fm / c at @xmath28 and then increases up to 30 fm / c near the dissociation temperature of @xmath1 .",
    "if the formation time is long , the energy - momenta of heavy quark and heavy antiquark will be modified from their initial ones .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ hidden2 ] ) is changed into @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the invariant mass distribution function of charm quark pairs at charmonium formation time .",
    "we use the langevin equation to get the time evolution of invariant mass distribution .",
    "the macroscopic langevin equation reads : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are random momentum kicks and momentum drag coefficient respectively .",
    "the random momentum kicks have the correlation  @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mean - squared momentum transfer per unit time .    from the solution of the langevin equation , eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) , @xmath36 derived are the relation  @xcite , @xmath37 and the diffusion constant in space  @xcite , which is denoted by @xmath38 , for a particle starting at @xmath39 , @xmath40 assuming @xmath41 .    considering nonzero initial momentum , the random momentum kick is separated into longitudinal and transverse components depending on the direction of heavy quark motion , @xmath42 . each component has the following correlations : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the unit vector of heavy quark momentum . in general @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "are functions of heavy quark momentum and temperature . as heavy quark momentum decreases , @xmath45 and @xmath46 close to each other and eq .",
    "( [ corr2 ] ) returns to eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) .    the solution of the langevin equation with nonzero initial momentum is given by @xmath47 assuming @xmath33 does not depend on heavy quark momentum , and the expectation value of squared momentum as a function of time by @xmath48 we note that there is not a mixed term in eq .",
    "( [ psquare ] ) due to no correlation between initial heavy quark momentum and random momentum kick . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ psquare ] ) is attributed to momentum diffusion of heavy quark and the second term to the attenuation of initial momentum .",
    "we assume that later heavy quark has a gaussian momentum distribution as @xmath49 , \\label{gaussian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is centered at @xmath50 with the longitudinal and transverse widths being respectively @xmath51    for numerical calculations , @xmath52 is taken to be 2 from lqcd  @xcite .",
    "once the diffusion constant , @xmath38 , is given , @xmath33 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for static charm quark are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) and ( [ diffusion ] ) : @xmath53 and then we assume @xmath45 and @xmath46 have the momentum dependence derived in pqcd  @xcite and @xmath33 is a function only of temperature . the latter assumption is supported also by pqcd calculations  @xcite . a sufficient time later @xmath54 disappears , and eq .  ( [ gaussian ] ) turns to a thermal distribution at the temperature given by eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) .    in our study ,",
    "initial charm and anticharm quarks are given by the pythia simulations  @xcite .",
    "the bare charm quark mass , @xmath14 , is tuned to be 1.25 gev for consistency .",
    "the black dashed lines in figure [ distributions ] are the initial distributions of charm quark pairs as functions of invariant mass .",
    "for each temperature one hundred thousand charm quark pairs are generated .     at initial productions and at charmonium",
    "formation times for temperatures of 1.0 @xmath28 and 1.1 @xmath28 . the initial distribution is given at @xmath55 200 gev in p+p collisions by the pythia simulations  @xcite and @xmath52 is taken to be 2 from lqcd  @xcite.,width=9 ]    then eq .",
    "( [ widths ] ) is calculated by multiplying @xmath56 and adding @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , to previous longitudinal and transverse widths at each time step till the charmonium formation time : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are functions of charm quark momentum which is determined from eq .",
    "( [ psquare ] ) by @xmath62 the same steps are taken for anticharm quark .",
    "the formation time of charmonium is calculated in the rest frame of charm quark pair : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the velocity of charm quark pair .",
    "so obtained @xmath65 and @xmath66 at the formation time are substituted into eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) and the momenta of charm and anticharm quarks are decided by the monte carlo method .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ distributions ] are the distributions of charm quark pairs as functions of invariant mass at charmonium formation times for temperatures of 1.0 @xmath28 and 1.1 @xmath28 .",
    "because the formation time is much longer at 1.1 @xmath28 than at 1.0 @xmath28 , the distribution is more shifted to lower invariant mass . in the view of the color evaporation model , it enhances charmonium production at high temperature in qgp , ignoring the change of dressed charm quark mass which was discussed in the previous section .",
    "now we combine sec .  [ cem ] and [ langevin ] to study the nuclear matter effect on charmonium formation in qgp .     200 gev in p+p collision .",
    "the dashed line is the ratio from the threshold energy change , the dotted line from the invariant mass change , and the solid line from both.,width=9 ]    figure [ raaf ] shows the ratios of charmonium production cross section in qgp to that in vaccum as functions of temperature at @xmath55 200 gev in p+p collision .",
    "the dashed line is the ratio of cross sections from the threshold energy change .",
    "the reduced masses of dressed charm and anticharm quarks suppress charmonium production by lowering the threshold energy for open charm production .",
    "the dotted line is the ratio from the invariant mass change of charm quark pair .",
    "the charm and anticharm spectra softened in qgp increase the cross section .",
    "the ratio begins to saturate above 1.1 @xmath28 , where the formation time of charmonium is long enough to thermalize charm quarks .",
    "the solid line is the ratio from both effects .",
    "it is shown that the effect of threshold energy change is stronger than that of invariant mass change .",
    "the cross section ratio decreases to 70 % at 1.0 @xmath28 and 50 % at 1.1 @xmath28 .",
    "however , it does not mean the @xmath1 suppression which is often measured in experiments . among the charmonia produced at @xmath55 200 gev in p+p collisions , roughly 50 % of them are @xmath1 and others excited states such as @xmath67 and @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "taking the free energy from lqcd for the potential energy between charm and anticharm quarks , the excited states of charmonium disappear above @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "therefore the charmonium in figure [ raaf ] is always @xmath1 and the ratio of @xmath1 production cross sections would be twice , which is between 1.0 and 1.4 .",
    "furthermore , it is known that about 40 % of @xmath1 are produced through the decay of @xmath67 and @xmath68  @xcite . subtracting this contribution , the cross section ratio for @xmath1",
    "is supposed to be 0.6 in qgp . in comparison with it",
    "our results are much larger",
    ".    for the potential energy between heavy quark pair , the internal energy from lqcd can be used as well  @xcite . in this case the charmonium production will be more enhanced , because the stronger binding makes the formation time shorter and the threshold energy for open charms higher .",
    "however , the internal energy potential from lqcd has a overshooting problem near @xmath28 where the @xmath1 mass and the binding energy are higher than those in vacuum  @xcite . and a recent study using the qcd sum rule supports the free energy potential rather than the internal energy one  @xcite .",
    "we studied the nuclear matter effect on charomium formation in qgp by using the color evaporation model .",
    "the color evaporation model was generalized to qgp phase by substituting the dressed charm and anticharm quark masses for the threshold energy for open charms and by modifying the invariant mass distribution of charm quark pairs in qgp .",
    "the former was done by using the free energy from lattice calculations as the potential energy between charm and anticharm quarks . the dressed charm and anticharm quark masses decrease with temperature and it suppresses charmonium production in qgp .",
    "the latter was carried out by using the langevin equation .",
    "initial charm and anticharm quarks in p+p collisions are generated by the pythia simulations .",
    "the drag and diffusion coefficients for a static heavy quark are obtained from lattice calculations and their momentum dependence from pqcd results .",
    "the nuclear matter softens charm and anticharm spectra in qgp , which enhances charmonium production in qgp .    combining both effects",
    ", we found that the cross section for charmonium production in p+p collision is reduced by 30 to 50 % in qgp compared to in vacuum .",
    "however , since @xmath1 is the only charmonium formed in qgp for the lattice free energy potential , the above results are interpreted as that @xmath1 production is similar or enhanced in qgp .",
