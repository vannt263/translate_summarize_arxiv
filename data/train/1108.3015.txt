    "beta lyrae a ( also known as hd 174638 , hr 7106 and ads 11745a ; hereafter  @xmath0 lyr \" ) is a bright , well - studied semi - detached eclipsing binary star system .",
    "the primary star is a b6-b8 ii , giant star (  loser \" ) with a mass of 3 m@xmath1 that is transferring matter to its main - sequence b0.5 v , 12.5 m@xmath1 , companion (  gainer \" ) at about @xmath2 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 via roche lobe overflow @xcite .",
    "this process has created a thick accretion disk that obscures the gainer @xcite . a bipolar flow or jet has also been detected in the system through interferometric and spectropolarimetric methods ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hnf ) .",
    "the system s mass ratio , @xmath4 , has been placed between 4.2 and 6 with an inclination angle , _ i _ , of 85@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "other studies have suggested @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "more recent determinations of the orbital inclination place its value at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these large mass ratios are evidence for mass reversal in the system s history .",
    "the disk s ability to obscure the gainer is due to the nearly edge - on inclination angle of the system .",
    "the system has a well - established orbital period of 12.9 days that increases at a rate of 19 s yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent interferometric observations have produced the first images of the system , which show the loser and the disk as separate objects and confirm the orientation of the system axis , near @xmath11 , previously inferred from hnf s polarimetric analysis @xcite .",
    "understanding how mass moves between and around the stars and leaves the system is imperative to understanding the evolutionary future of @xmath0 lyr .",
    "however , interferometric techniques have yet to resolve the mass stream or bipolar outflows .",
    "we have used spectropolarimetry to study the system and begin to unlock the evolutionary clues contained within the circumstellar material .",
    "light scattering from electrons in the highly ionized circumstellar material in @xmath0 lyr produces a variable phase - dependent polarization . since electron scattering preserves information about the orientation of the scattering region , analyzing polarimetric behavior as a function of wavelength allows us to determine from where in the system different spectral features have arisen . in this way",
    ", spectropolarimetric observations of @xmath0 lyr can be used to infer the geometrical properties of the scattering material in the system .",
    "optical polarimetry was used to study @xmath0 lyr as early as 1934 , but it was not known until 1963 that the system exhibited variable polarization @xcite .",
    "appenzeller and hiltner ( 1967 ; hereafter ah ) were the first to publish interstellar polarization ( isp ) corrected broadband _ ubv _ polarization curves of @xmath0 lyr .",
    "more recently , hnf published isp - corrected polarized light curves in the _ v _ band and h@xmath12 and @xmath13 emission lines using a subset of the data we present here .",
    "hnf used the position angles of the polarized uv continuum and the hydrogen balmer emission lines to confirm that a bipolar outflow exists in the @xmath0 lyr system after their discovery by harmanec et al .",
    "hnf also interpreted the average position angle of the visible polarized light ( @xmath14 ) to be the physical axis of the binary system , an interpretation which was borne out by the interferometric images presented by zhao et al ( 2008 ) and schmitt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "in this paper we present new _ bvri _ and @xmath155876 polarization curves and polarized light curves of @xmath0 lyr .",
    "the details of our spectropolarimetric observations and our interstellar polarization corrections are in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents and displays our observational results .",
    "we analyze our findings in section 4 and summarize conclusions in section 5 .",
    "this study compiles data from three distinct data sets .",
    "the first consists of 69 optical spectropolarimetric observations of @xmath0 lyr taken over 6 years with the university of wisconsin s half - wave spectropolarimeter ( hpol ) at the 0.9 m telescope at pine bluff observatory ( pbo ) ; the second data set comprises 6 years of broadband optical polarimetric data obtained at the flower and cook observatory ; and the third is 3 years of archived broadband optical polarimetric data from ah taken with the 24 inch rotatable telescope at the yerkes observatory . to calculate the phase for each observation , we used the ephemeris @xmath16 where _ e _ is the total number of orbits since the primary eclipse that occurred at hjd 2,408,247.966 @xcite .",
    "this is the same ephemeris used by hnf ; it does not significantly differ from the more recent ephemeris presented by ak et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .      the first 14 hpol observations , obtained between 1992 september and 1994 november , used a dual reticon array detector with a wavelength range of 3200 - 7600   and a resolution of 15   ( see wolff , nordsieck , & nook 1996 for further instrument information ) .",
    "the remaining 55 observations , taken between 1995 march and 1998 september , used a ccd - based system .",
    "this extended the wavelength range , 3200 - 10500  , and increased the resolution to 7.5   below 6000   and 10   above @xcite .",
    "the first 29 observations were previously published in hnf ; they have undergone recalibration for use in this study .",
    "table [ betlyrobs ] lists the orbital phases along with civil and heliocentric julian dates for the midpoint of each hpol observation .",
    "each @xmath0 lyr observation covers the full spectral range , with the exception of the four nights indicated in table [ betlyrobs ] .",
    "two observations , 1995 may 27 and 1995 august 14 , used only the red grating ( 6,000 - 10500  ) of the ccd system while the other two , 1997 may 17 and 1997 may 26 , used only the blue grating ( 3200 - 6000  ) .",
    "each individual observation typically lasted between 45 minutes and an hour ( approximately 0.03 to 0.04 days ) when both gratings were used .",
    "we used 11 hpol observations of @xmath0 lyr b taken between 1995 may and 1999 november to obtain an isp estimate .",
    "beta lyr b is a member of the same association as @xmath0 lyr a and is located 45 \" away @xcite .",
    "all of these observations were made using hpol s ccd - based system . table [ betlyrobs ] also lists the civil and heliocentric julian dates that correspond to the midpoints of each observation of @xmath0 lyr b and indicates which grating(s ) were used during the observations . the first two observations , 1995 may 21 and 1996 july 3 , were previously published in hnf and have undergone recalibration for this study .",
    "we reduced all of the hpol observations using the reduce software package ( described by wolff et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we estimated the isp by fitting a modified serkowski law curve to the error - weighted mean of the 11 observations of @xmath0 lyr b @xcite .",
    "the parameters for our isp estimate are @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath18 @xmath21  , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath18 @xmath24 .",
    "we subtracted this isp estimate from the hpol @xmath0 lyr data .",
    "this new isp correction has significantly improved uncertainties over previous estimates ; it is consistent with the hnf estimate ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath18 @xmath27  , and @xmath28 @xmath18 @xmath29 ) , which was determined using only the 1995 may 21 hpol observation .",
    "ah found a similar estimate , @xmath30 @xmath18 @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath18 @xmath33 by taking the weighted mean of the observed polarization of the associated stars @xmath0 lyr b , e , and f.      our second data set is made up of 19 _ b _ band , 88 _",
    "v _ band and 17 _ r _ band observations obtained at the flower and cook observatory between 1987 and 1992 with the pemp instrument @xcite .",
    "the length of each observation was between 20 and 25 minutes ( approximately 0.01 days ) .",
    "the phases along with the civil and heliocentric julian dates for each observation are listed in table [ betlyrobsfco ] .",
    "we have no observations of @xmath0 lyr b taken with the same instrument as this data set .",
    "therefore , we used the serkowski fit to the hpol @xmath0 lyr b observations ( see section 2.1 ) to calculate the isp contributions at the central wavelengths of the _ bvr _ bands and subtracted these estimated values from the observations in this data set .",
    "we list these data and isp subtracted data in tables [ bfcodata ] through [ rfcodata ] .",
    "we also used archival _",
    "polarization data taken between 1964 and 1966 , originally published in ah .",
    "this data set consists of 37 _ b _ band and 127 _ v _ band observations , the details of which can be found in ah ( and references therein ) .",
    "the dc two - channel polarimeter was rotated @xmath34 between 12 separate 20 second exposures of @xmath0 lyr and the sky @xcite .",
    "therefore , the total integration time for both @xmath0 lyr and the sky was 4 minutes ( approximately 0.003 days ) .",
    "we converted these data from polarization magnitudes to percent polarization and converted their julian dates to heliocentric julian dates for use in this study .",
    "for consistency between the hpol and ah data sets , we did not use ah s published isp corrected data because it included two stars ( @xmath0 lyr e and f ) that are not included in the hpol isp estimate .",
    "instead , we subtracted only the ah _ bv _",
    "@xmath0 lyr b observations from their non - isp corrected @xmath0 lyr data in each respective band .",
    "to examine the behavior of the continuum polarization with orbital phase , we applied synthetic _ bvri _ johnson - cousins band filters ( described by bessell 1990 ) to the isp - corrected hpol data .",
    "the filter routine produces broadband values and associated internal errors for each observation ; however , we must still take into account systematic variations in the instrumental polarization between nights .",
    "systematic errors for hpol at pbo were evaluated by periodically analyzing observations of unpolarized standard stars .",
    "tables [ bhpoldata ] through [ ihpoldata ] list broadband polarization values and internal errors determined by the filter routine along with the systematic errors . in the case of the reticon data , the systematic errors are less well determined ; based on our previous experience with these data , we have estimated the uncertainties in the stokes parameters for the reticon data to be @xmath35 in all bands . figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] display these data graphically , using the larger of the internal and systematic errors for each observation , along with the fco and ah data .",
    "the position angles for the _ bvri _ bands remain relatively constant with orbital phase except near secondary eclipse , where the position angle values appear to rotate away from the mean value .",
    "the bottom panels in figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] show this behavior in each band . in the standard picture of the system ,",
    "the polarization is produced by scattering from the accretion disk edge ; the average position angle at these wavelengths should therefore provide us with an estimate of the orientation of the axis of the disk and thus of the system as a whole . to calculate the average position angle in each band",
    ", we excluded the secondary eclipse points ( between phases 0.425 and 0.575 ) because they do not follow the near - constant trend displayed at other phases and performed a linear , error - weighted , least - squares fit to the remaining data in _ q - u _ space .",
    "we then used the slopes of the fitted lines to determine the position angles listed in table [ betlyrpa ] .",
    "we also calculated a position angle for balmer jump index ( the vector difference between the polarization above and below the balmer jump ) .",
    "as discussed in hnf , the broadband polarization in @xmath0 lyr undergoes a @xmath36 position angle rotation across the balmer jump .",
    "thus , this vector difference defines the system axis in _ q - u _ space .",
    "because the balmer jump index is independent of the isp , it provides us with an independent estimate of the orientation of the system axis .",
    "we find the weighted mean position angle of the hpol reticon and ccd bands and the balmer jump index to be @xmath37 .",
    "for each band , the ccd and reticon position angles do not agree within uncertainties , with the reticon data yielding larger position angles in all bands .",
    "this result is due to poor sampling in _ q - u _ space ; the reticon data only consist of 14 data points in each band while there are 55 observations in the ccd _ v _ and _ r _ bands and 53 observations in the ccd _ b _ and _ i _ bands .",
    "this skews the linear fit since the full range of possible observable _ q - u _ values is not well covered by the reticon data .",
    "however , the larger systematic uncertainties we adopt for the reticon data result in these points carrying a lower weight in the fit ; thus , we are confident that our weighted mean is a fair representation of the true system axis .",
    "hnf found the mean _ v _ band position angle to be @xmath38 ; while our estimate is not formally consistent with hnf s , it shows the broad band polarization behavior of the system is the same in all optical bands .",
    "our polarization position angle implies a system position angle , defined by the position angle of the disk axis , of @xmath39 on the sky .",
    "as expected for polarization by electron scattering , the position angle of the polarized light is perpendicular to the position angles describing the system orientation given by zhao et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and schmitt et al .",
    "zhao et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimated the position angle of the system s ascending node as @xmath40 and @xmath41 using two different image reconstruction techniques on their interferometric data and @xmath42 using a model of the system , while schmitt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) estimate @xmath43 .",
    "we rotated all of the hpol , ah and fco data to the average position angle of @xmath14 .",
    "this orients our data with respect to the intrinsic polarization axis of the system . after this rotation ,",
    "@xmath44 averages to zero in each band and the polarization varies significantly only in the @xmath45 direction . in the rest of this paper we present the projected stokes parameter",
    "@xmath46 resulting from this rotation .",
    "the use of this quantity is beneficial because it can be positive or negative , whereas % _ p _ is always positive .",
    "data points that have a position angle near @xmath14 will have a positive @xmath46 value while points with a position angle perpendicular to this ( near @xmath47 ) will have a negative @xmath46 .",
    "hereafter we display only @xmath46 because @xmath48 values scatter around zero . because the rotation is a simple trigonometric calculation , we present in tables [ bfcodata ] through [ ihpoldata ] the unrotated @xmath49 and isp subtracted fco and hpol data only .",
    "the middle panels in figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] show the @xmath46 curves for the _ bvri _ bands after rotation .",
    "we used the program period04 to perform a fourier fit to the data for each band @xcite .",
    "the period04 fitting formula is @xmath50 where _ n _ is the number of sine terms in the fit , _ z _ is the zero point , _ a _ is the amplitude , @xmath51 is the frequency , and @xmath52 is the phase .",
    "the results of the fits are displayed as solid curves in each figure and their parameters are given in table [ fitparam ] .",
    "band , and to a lesser extent the _ b _ band , fourier fits deviate from the data at phase 0.9 ( see figure [ vband ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy disappears in the _ v _ band if we include three frequency terms in the fourier fit .",
    "however , we are not as confident in the third frequency as we are in the first two because the period04 fitting program produces a reasonable third term for the _ v _ band only . therefore , in table [ fitparam ]",
    "we report parameters for only the first two terms , but we display both the two - term and three - term fits in figure [ vband ] .",
    "these fits provide the first quantitative representations of the polarization variations in the @xmath0 lyr system .",
    "the data in the _ bvri _ bands are almost always positive , indicating their position angles stay near @xmath14 throughout the orbital period .",
    "each of the bands displays an increase in @xmath46 at primary eclipse and two other increases near the quadrature phases ( 0.25 and 0.75 ) .",
    "the height difference between the polarization bumps at the quadrature phases noted by hnf disappears now that more data are added , but we note that the _ b _ and _",
    "v _ phase 0.25 bump have a higher dispersion around the average @xmath46 value than does the 0.75 phase bump .",
    "r _ and _ i _ band show the opposite behavior ; future observations will be able to tell us whether this is due to their poor phase coverage or whether it indicates that the _ r _ and _ i _ bands are probing a different region of the disk than the _ b _ and _ v _ bands .",
    "we calculated the variance of the two quadrature bumps between phases 0.25 and 0.35 , and 0.65 and 0.75 to formally show this .",
    "the first quadrature bump has _",
    "bvri _ variances of 0.081 @xmath18 0.006 , 0.110 @xmath18 0.005 , 0.040 @xmath18 0.002 , and 0.016 @xmath18 0.002 respectively , while the second quadrature bump has variances of 0.048 @xmath18 0.005 , 0.027 @xmath18 0.002 , 0.281 @xmath18 0.005 , and 0.069 @xmath18 0.004 .",
    "the _ r _ and _ i _ bands also produce a lower polarization signal than the _ b _ and _ v _ bands .",
    "this change in polarization behavior with wavelength could indicate that scattering mechanisms other than electron scattering are present in the system .",
    "however , more observations in the _ r _ and _ i _ bands are needed to rule out the possibility that the low signal is due to a lack of phase coverage in these bands .",
    "figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] also show that in each band , the polarization curve has a fitted minimum in polarization that occurs just prior to the secondary eclipse in total light .",
    "this minimum is accompanied by a rotation in the position angle of the polarized light away from its average value .",
    "table [ hssize ] gives the phases of the @xmath53 fourier fit minimum in all bands .",
    "the offset between secondary eclipse in polarized light and total light is a new result , seen here for the first time due to the improved phase coverage in these data .",
    "we discuss the implications of this phenomenon in section 4 .    at primary eclipse , there are hints of similar behavior : the polarization maxima in the _ b _ and _ v _ bands occur slightly before phase 0.0 , and all bands show a deviation from the mean position angle at and just after phase 0.0 .",
    "however , we consider the primary eclipse features to be less significant than the ones at secondary eclipse for the following reasons .",
    "the three data points showing noticeable deviations from the mean position angle all occurred on the same night , 1997 august 25 , which suggests that this effect may be due to a non - periodic process intrinsic to the @xmath0 lyr system , or to a change in observing conditions that affected that night s data . if the same structure is responsible for the phenomena at both eclipses , we expect that a similar position angle scatter should exist in observations from the same orbit of the system whose phases are between primary and secondary eclipse , when such a structure should be most visible to the observer .",
    "however , neither the data from 1997 august 26 , nor 1997 august 30 show such behavior .",
    "additionally , the polarization maximum in the _ r _ band occurs at phase 0.0 within the uncertainties , and in the _ i _ band the maximum occurs just after phase 0.0 . if we include the third term in the _ v _ band fourier fit , the primary polarization maximum occurs at phase 0.0 within uncertainties .",
    "because the eclipse behavior is not consistent between bands and the associated position angle scatter appears to have occurred during only one orbit of the system , we consider it unlikely that these are due to a stable physical structure within the system ( see section 4 for further discussion of the effects seen at primary eclipse ) .",
    "figure [ allbands ] displays the projected polarized _",
    "flux light curves for the @xmath0 lyr system . to create these polarized light curves , we multiplied the fitted polarization curves shown in figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] by their respective fourier fit light curves @xcite normalized to maximum light . in all bands ,",
    "the polarized flux remains nearly constant across primary eclipse due to a decrease in total light and an increase in @xmath53 .",
    "the secondary eclipse offset seen in figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] persists in figure [ allbands ] , while quadrature phases display local maxima .",
    "the _ b _ and _ v _ band appear to be the most similar ; they overlap for most phases , while outside of secondary eclipse and the first quadrature phase the _ r _ and _ i _ bands produce the lowest net projected polarized flux .",
    "we do not consider the apparent height differences between bands at the quadrature phases to be significant due to the scatter in the observational points and the lack of coverage in the _ r _ and _ i _ bands .",
    "we also took advantage of the spectropolarimetric nature of the data by studying the polarization behavior of the strongest optical emission lines in @xmath0 lyr s spectrum : h@xmath12 , h@xmath0 , @xmath155876 , @xmath156678 , and @xmath157065 .",
    "hnf hypothesized that the h@xmath12 , h@xmath0 , @xmath155876 and @xmath157065 lines , which show a negative projected polarization , scatter in the bipolar outflow , while the @xmath156678 scatters on the edge of the disk .",
    "however , hnf did not have enough data to construct a full polarization phase curve for the lines .",
    "our expanded data set allows us to do this .",
    "however , we present only our @xmath155876 results in graphical form because our uncertainties are relatively large due to signal - to - noise limitations . rather than present the h@xmath12 , h@xmath0 , @xmath156678 , and @xmath157065 data , we describe their general behavior below .",
    "future observations will allow us to use these data to draw quantitative conclusions about the scattering regions that give rise to the polarization in these lines .    in order to calculate the polarization for each emission line , we used the flux equivalent width method described by hnf , using the same line and continuum regions as far as possible .",
    "we corrected the h@xmath12 and h@xmath0 lines for underlying unpolarized absorption components ( arising from the loser ) in the same manner as hnf , using their preferred absorption equivalent widths of @xmath54 for h@xmath12 and @xmath55 for h@xmath0 .",
    "this has the following effect on the data .",
    "the continuum is positively polarized while the lines are negatively polarized .",
    "if we do not correct for unpolarized absorption , we remove too much continuum , and thus our resulting line polarization is too negative . with the absorption correction ,",
    "the continuum contribution is smaller and the magnitude of the polarization is also smaller , resulting in a less negative @xmath56 .",
    "we do not present the hpol reticon line polarization values due to their large uncertainties .",
    "figure [ hei5876 ] shows @xmath56 and position angle curves for the @xmath155876 line .",
    "it has a negative @xmath56 ; thus its position angle is perpendicular to the intrinsic axis of the system .",
    "in addition , the polarization for the line approaches zero at both primary and secondary eclipses .",
    "for this to happen , the scattering region for this line must lie near enough to the orbital plane of the system to be occulted both by the loser and by the disk .",
    "hnf previously suggested that this line scatters in the bipolar outflows because its average position angles lie near @xmath47 , corresponding to negative values of @xmath53 .",
    "the results from our extended data set support this interpretation and further suggest that the @xmath155876 scattering region within the outflows must lie between the loser and the disk and have a vertical extent comparable to the height of the disk .",
    "the h@xmath12 , h@xmath0 , and @xmath157065 lines also all display a negative @xmath56 and are likely scattered in the same region as the @xmath155876 line .",
    "their average position angles are listed in table [ betlyrpa ] .",
    "the @xmath156678 data show a polarization behavior different from that of the other lines .",
    "the data are generally positively polarized and their average position angle , @xmath57 , agrees more closely with the intrinsic axis of the system than do those of the other emission lines ( see table [ betlyrpa ] ) .      besides the primary orbital period of @xmath0 lyr ( 12.9 days ) , analysis of light curves has revealed several longer periodicities .",
    "a 340-day period was detected by peel ( 1997 ) , while both van hamme et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and harmanec et al ( 1996 ) detected a 282-day period .",
    "wilson and van hamme ( 1999 ) searched polarimetry from ah , hnf , @xcite , and @xcite for periodicities but did not detect anything significant .",
    "we performed a lomb - scargle power spectrum analysis to search for any periodic behavior in our polarimetric broadband ( hpol , ah , and fco ) and line data ( h@xmath12 and @xmath15 5876 ) not associated with the 12.9 day orbital period of the system .",
    "while none of the previously detected longer periods were found , our analysis indicates the presence of periods of approximately 4.3 days in both the _ v _ and _ b _ bands with a false alarm probability ( fap ; horne & baliunas 1986 ) of @xmath58 when using all three data sets .",
    "none of the other bands or the line polarization data appear to contain periods other than the orbital period .",
    "we also searched for periods within the hpol , ah and fco data sets individually to look for any transient periodic variations .",
    "we find that the 4.3 day period also appears in the _ v _ and _ b _ ah data set with a fap of @xmath58 , but it does not appear in the other two data sets .",
    "this period is exactly one third of the 12.9-day orbital period of the @xmath0 lyr system and results from the combination of two separate effects : the increase in polarization at the quadrature phases due to light scattering off the disk edge and the increase in polarization at primary eclipse due to the occultation of unpolarized light by the loser ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hwn ) .",
    "these two effects cause the @xmath56 curves to form a complete cosine curve between phases 0.0 and 0.3 , a second cosine curve between phases 0.3 and 0.6 and a third cosine between 0.6 and 1.0 ( see figures 1 through 4 ) .",
    "therefore , this period does not provide new information about the @xmath0 lyr system .",
    "we also performed a much simpler analysis to search for signatures of the 282-day period , which has been ascribed to variability of the conditions of the circumstellar and circumbinary gas @xcite .",
    "time plots of @xmath56 , @xmath59 , position angle , and percent polarization for each of the _ bvri _ bands and the @xmath155876 line did not reveal the 282-day period and are therefore not shown . however , the time coverage of our observations is very uneven and could have prevented us from detecting variations on this time scale .",
    "the observations in our data set were taken between 1964 and 1998 , but we have no polarimetric observations taken during 1990 , 1991 , or between 1966 and 1987 .",
    "the number of observations performed per year only adds further complications ; several years have very few observations .",
    "we also note that the only the hpol data set has observations of every band and the @xmath155876 line . for these reasons",
    ", we also performed an analysis similar to harmanec et al .",
    "( 1996 ) on the @xmath56 data for each band and the @xmath155876 line .",
    "plotting the data on the 282.37 day period mitigates the lack of time coverage by  folding \" observations onto one cycle .",
    "we plotted the data from selected orbital period phase bins versus their phase on the 282.37 day period ( see harmanec et al .",
    "1996 for a similar analysis of a large amount of _ v _ band total - light photometry ) .",
    "we chose the following five orbital phase bins for several reasons : the 0.0 - 1.0 bin allows us to use all of the data , the 0.6 - 0.15 bin is where harmanec et al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected the 282.37 day period the most strongly , the 0.25 - 0.35 and 0.65 - 0.75 bins allow us to determine whether the polarization of the quadrature phases changes on a 282.37 day time scale , and the 0.425 - 0.575 bin allows us to determine whether the secondary eclipse has a 282.37 day periodic behavior .",
    "the 0.25 - 0.35 , 0.425 - 0.575 , and 0.65 - 0.75 orbital period bins are too tight to leave a useful number of observations in the _ r _ and _ i _ bands and the @xmath155876 line . while the _ b _ and _ v _ bands are slightly less affected by the size of the 0.25 - 0.35 , 0.425 - 0.575 , and 0.65 - 0.75 orbital phase bins , their behavior does not indicate , by eye or by using period04 , the presence of a variation on a 282.37 day period .",
    "the size of the 0.6 - 0.15 and 0.0 - 1.0 bins present the best chance of detecting this period because the amount of data is not severely reduced .",
    "however , neither bin reveals the presence of the 282.37 day period .",
    "we also subtracted the fourier fits from the data in the _ bvri _ bands ( see section 3.1 ) and searched the residuals for the 282.37 day period with the same bins used for the original @xmath56 data .",
    "the analysis on the residuals produced similar results ; we do not find evidence of a 282.37 day period in either the @xmath56 data or the fourier fit subtracted residuals .",
    "however , we note that the fourier fits deviate from the data at some phases ( see section 3.1 ) . plots from this analysis resemble scatter plots and are therefore not shown .",
    "in interpreting their polarized flux curves , hnf proposed two different possibilities for the origin and scattering location of the visible light . in their  disk - disk \" case ,",
    "this light arises from within the disk and scatters from the disk edge ; in the  loser - lobe \" case , the _ v_-band continuum light arises from the loser and scatters from material between the loser and the disk . in this analysis ,",
    "hnf implicitly assumed that all features of the visible polarized flux curve are due to the same origin and scatterer .",
    "however , modeling work by hwn and subsequent modeling results ( hoffman et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "have shown that the scattered light can originate both from the loser and from the disk in differing proportions over the binary cycle .",
    "these newer results suggest the following interpretations of our _ bvri _ polarization curves .",
    "the net increase in @xmath46 at primary eclipse ( figures [ bband]-[iband ] ) is the result of the unpolarized light from the primary star being blocked by the disk material at phase 0.0 .",
    "hnf interpreted the increase in @xmath46 at the quadrature phases as arising in one of two ways : light originating from within the disk and scattering from the disk edge , or light originating from the loser and scattering from material between the stars .",
    "we propose , based on recent modeling work by hoffman , that these  quadrature bumps \" form simply by loser light scattering from the disk edge .",
    "the minimum at secondary eclipse occurs because the unpolarized primary star blocks light scattered in the secondary component .",
    "near secondary eclipse in all four broadband @xmath46 curves , the minimum in polarization precedes the minimum in total light ; the phases for the polarization minimum in the _ bvri _ bands are listed in table [ hssize ] . in each band , this minimum corresponds to a rotation in position angle away from the average value ; the phase ranges for this rotation are also listed in table [ hssize ] . in the basic star - star - disk model for the system , there is no mechanism to produce this disparity . if the loser is an unpolarized source , as indicated by the absence of a primary eclipse in the polarized flux curves ( figure 5 ; hnf ) , then the polarization minimum produced by its transit across the disk should be centered at flux minimum ( phase 0.5 ; hwn ) . thus , to explain this offset",
    ", we need to invoke another system component .",
    "since @xmath0 lyr is a mass transfer system , it most likely contains a mass stream connecting the loser and the disk as well as a ` hot spot ' where the mass stream from the loser interacts with the disk edge ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the geometries proposed by hnf ) .",
    "some studies ( for example , bisikalo et al . 2000 and references therein ) suggest that the manner in which the mass stream approaches the disk prevents a hot spot from forming . instead",
    ", a portion of the stream makes a full revolution around the disk and then interacts with the original stream .",
    "the process of this interaction allows the material that has made a full revolution around the secondary star to become part of mass stream again ; bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) do not consider it to be part of the disk .",
    "since this material s position angle is the same as the disk in the system , polarimetry can not distinguish between the two possibilities .",
    "therefore , we use the term ` hot spot ' to refer to the region where the mass stream interacts with material already encircling the secondary star and assume that any material which has completed a revolution around the secondary star is part of the disk .",
    "even if a true  hot spot \" is not created by the mass stream - disk interaction , the region where the stream and disk meet could potentially decrease observed polarization from the disk edge by disrupting the otherwise smooth structure of the disk edge and adding unpolarized light at phases when it is visible . on the other hand , the mass stream ,",
    "which is elongated in the same direction as the disk , should produce a polarization position angle very similar to that of the disk .",
    "therefore , the presence of the mass stream should not lead to a decrease in the observed polarization .",
    "the effects of a hot spot would be detectable in the polarization light curves in the _ bvri _ bands because the disk is the primary scattering region for visible light in the @xmath0 lyr system .",
    "but , if it is not significantly brighter than the surrounding disk , the hot spot would not be visible in the total light curves .",
    "therefore , we interpret the @xmath56 minimum associated with the randomization of the polarized position angle prior to secondary eclipse as the first direct evidence for the proposed hot spot on the @xmath0 lyr disk edge @xcite .",
    "we expect the hot spot to create an unstructured region on the disk edge where the polarization vectors of the scattered light are randomized in position angle .",
    "when this part of the disk is visible , the hot spot should cause a decreased polarization signal and a rotation in position angle , both of which occur in our polarization curves ( figures [ bband]-[iband ] ) .",
    "as long as the hot spot does not lie on the line connecting the centers of mass of the two stars , and its brightness in the visible continuum is similar to that of the undisturbed disk , its effect should result in a minimum in polarization that does not correspond to a minimum in flux .",
    "hydrodynamical modeling of the @xmath0 lyr system indicates that the mass stream , and therefore its associated hot spot , should lead the loser in the sense of rotation of the system @xcite . in the @xmath0",
    "lyr polarization curves , the polarization minimum and concurrent position angle variation occur just before secondary eclipse , suggesting that the hot spot begins its transit of the disk before the loser does .",
    "in fact , the larger dispersion of points in the _ b _ and _ v _ bands at the first quadrature phase when compared to the second quadrature phase suggests that the hot spot is already in view by phase 0.25 . in this picture",
    ", the minimum polarization occurs at the phases where the disk area disrupted by the hot spot and eclipsed by the loser is maximized .",
    "we sketch this proposed interpretation in figure [ hotspoteffect ] .",
    "we note that in all bands , there are fewer data points after secondary eclipse than before , which may skew the @xmath60 fourier fit near secondary minimum .",
    "however , we have several reasons to believe the eclipse offset is not an artifact of the fit .",
    "the effect is apparent in all filters , some of which have a much lower point density in phase then the _ v _ band .",
    "( however , the _ v _",
    "band displays the smallest difference between the @xmath60 near secondary minimum and phase 0.5 . ) the position angle rotation does not heavily depend on the number of points , is apparent in all bands , and has a larger effect at pre - secondary eclipse phases than post - secondary eclipse phases .",
    "finally , the uncertainties on the phases at which the minima occur are small ( see table [ hssize ] ) compared to the difference between phase 0.5 and the polarization secondary minimum . future work will include filling in the post - secondary data gap with new hpol observations to improve the fourier fits and quantify the @xmath60 near secondary minimum offsets more reliably .    in the subsections below",
    ", we outline three different estimates of the size of the hot spot , assuming it has the same height as the edge of the disk .",
    "we use the following values for system parameters : a loser radius of @xmath61 , a disk diameter of @xmath62 , a binary separation of @xmath63 , and a disk height of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we can use the offset in secondary eclipse to estimate a maximum size for the hot spot . assuming circular orbits",
    ", we have the scenario depicted in figure [ hotspotsize ] .",
    "knowing that phase 0.5 occurs at an angle of 180@xmath5 on the circle depicting the loser s orbit , we can use a simple ratio to find the angle @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the phase for which secondary eclipse occurs in polarized light ( table [ hssize ] ) and @xmath68 is the angle from zero at which phase @xmath67 occurs . if we know @xmath65 , we can also find the length of line @xmath69 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the radius between the center of the disk and the center of the loser . with the length of line @xmath69 we can estimate the projected size of the hot spot , @xmath72 ( hatched region in the observer s view in figure [ hotspotsize ] ) , with the following equation , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the diameter of the accretion disk and @xmath75 is the radius of the loser .    using the above formulae we can calculate the maximum projected hot spot size for the _ bvri _ bands .",
    "table [ hssize ] lists the results .",
    "the maximum hot spot size ranges from 22 @xmath76 to 33 @xmath76 .",
    "since we assume the hot spot has the same height as the disk , these values represent ` widths ' along the projected face of the disk .",
    "we do not calculate formal error bars on these estimates because the estimates vary so widely .",
    "we also used the variations in position angle to estimate a maximum size for the hot spot .",
    "first , we calculated the size of the disk in phase . to do this",
    "we solved equation 2 for @xmath65 when @xmath77 .",
    "the phase for the left side of the disk as depicted in figure [ hotspotsize ] is then given by equation 1 .",
    "we calculate this phase to be 0.413 .",
    "similarly for the right side of the disk we calculate a phase of 0.587 .",
    "the resulting size of the disk in phase is the difference of these phases , or 0.174 .",
    "we then estimated the size of the hot spot in phase by finding how long the randomization of position angle lasts .",
    "we assumed any points near secondary eclipse that deviated significantly from the average position angle were due to the hot spot .",
    "we did not use a formal calculation to find these points ; we chose the smallest and largest phases for the randomized position angles by eye .",
    "we then took the difference in phase between the deviant observations with the smallest and largest phases to calculate the size of the hot spot in phase , @xmath78 ( table [ hssize ] ) . in this case the maximum hot spot size , @xmath79 , is given by the ratio @xmath80 table [ hssize ] lists the maximum projected size of the hot spot across the edge of the disk for each band .",
    "our hot spot size estimates found with this method range from 26 @xmath76 to 58 @xmath76 .",
    "we used a simple model for a third estimate of the size of the hot spot . for this model",
    "we assume the polarization of the disk is uniform across the disk edge .",
    "we first calculated a baseline @xmath81 , the polarized flux due to the disk s self - illumination , by taking the error - weighted mean @xmath53 multiplied by the normalized fourier fit flux of the observations between phases 0.7 and 1.2 for each band ( hwn ) .",
    "this assumes all the polarized flux at these phases is due to light originating within the disk rather than from the loser , a reasonable assumption given the results of hwn .",
    "we also define @xmath82 , the minimum polarized flux near secondary eclipse due to the primary star s eclipse and hot spot s transit of the disk , to be the error - weighted mean @xmath53 multiplied by the normalized fourier fit flux for observations between phases 0.4 and 0.55 .",
    "if we subtract from @xmath81 the amount of polarized flux blocked by the primary star and disrupted by the transit of the hot spot , the result should be @xmath82 , the polarized flux observed at secondary eclipse .    the amount of polarized flux lost due to the primary eclipsing the disk and the hot spot transiting the disk is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the area of the disk eclipsed by the primary star ( shaded region in figure [ hotspotsize ] ) , @xmath85 is the observed area of the edge of the disk , and @xmath86 is the area of the disk edge disrupted by the hot spot .",
    "the fraction @xmath87 gives the polarized flux per unit area from the disk .",
    "the second term is the polarized flux eclipsed by the primary star and the third term is the polarized flux subtracted by the hot spot .",
    "we note that equation 5 assumes an inclination angle of @xmath88 and that each unit area of the disk contributes to the polarized flux equally . in reality , the relative contributions of each portion of a disk with an inclination angle of @xmath88 are not equal due to limb darkening .",
    "taking limb darkening into account would complicate our estimates ; a hot spot near a limb darkened edge of the disk would need to be larger to account for the same amount polarized flux loss that would be lost by a hot spot closer to the center of the disk .",
    "table [ hssize ] gives @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and the resulting hot spot size estimate for the _ bvri _ bands using equation 5 .",
    "assuming an inclination angle of @xmath89 @xcite instead of @xmath36 changes the equation we use to calculate @xmath90 . in this case , the area of the disk that we see is larger than in the edge - on case ; projection effects allow us to see a small portion of the back side of the disk .",
    "the visible portion of the interior of the disk is polarized differently than the disk edge ; the polarized flux from the interior should cancel with some of the polarized flux from the disk edge . also , the area eclipsed by the primary star is larger and the center of the star is no longer aligned with the plane that cuts the disk into equal bottom and top halves .    in order to calculate an estimate for @xmath89 , we make the assumption that the area of the disk we see is rectangular .",
    "this makes our calculations easier since the projected height of the disk does not change across the disk edge , but has the effect of making our estimate smaller ; if the edges of the projected disk have a height of @xmath91 and the center of the projected disk has a larger height due to the projection , the total area of the disk is smaller than a rectangle whose height is the projected height ( see figure [ ieffects ] ) .",
    "this assumption allows us to use equation 5 with a slight adjustment : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the projected disk height .",
    "a simple calculation reveals that @xmath94 .",
    "the area of the hot spot , @xmath86 , remains unchanged because the hot spot is only on the front portion of the disk .",
    "therefore , it does not take up the full projected disk height .",
    "we note that we do not have to account for the cancellation of polarized light due to the contribution from the interior of the disk .",
    "we are using our observations to estimate @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and these numbers should therefore already incorporate this effect , if it is present .",
    "however , we still make the assumption that each portion of the disk contributes to the polarized flux equally . besides the complication due to limb",
    "darkening mentioned previously , this enlarges our size estimate because more area is needed to cancel out the same amount of polarized flux .",
    "table [ hssize ] gives the resulting hot spot size estimate for the _ bvri _ bands when @xmath89 using equation 6 .    in our estimates ,",
    "the size of the hot spot is smaller when the inclination angle is @xmath95 compared to @xmath36 for the following reason .",
    "the area of the disk is larger in the @xmath89 method compared to the @xmath88 method by a factor of approximately 1.3 .",
    "this causes the amount of polarized flux per unit area to decrease by a factor of 0.8 . however , the area eclipsed by the primary star increases by more than a factor of two .",
    "therefore , the amount of polarized light lost due to the hot spot is smaller when @xmath89 than when @xmath88 .      comparing all three methods",
    ", we find a wide range of sizes for the hot spot .",
    "the smallest size estimate is 2 r@xmath96 ( _ i _ band ) while the largest is 58 r@xmath96 ( _ v _ band ) .",
    "r _ and _ i _ band estimates are the most likely to change with additional data because their current phase coverage is not as good as the _ b _ and _ v _ bands .",
    "band estimates have the closest agreement between the three methods ; they range from 22 r@xmath96 to 33 r@xmath96 , while the _ v _ band estimates have the largest range , 9 r@xmath96 to 58 r@xmath96 . the overlap region for size ranges in all the bands",
    "is 22 r@xmath96 to 33 r@xmath96 .",
    "the large size of our estimates lends support to the possibility that we are actually detecting the portion of the mass stream which has not interacted with the disk and not a hot spot , similar to the findings of bisikalo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . the largest hot spot size estimate , 58 r@xmath96 , is similar in size to the diameter of the disk , 60 r@xmath96 , and the same as the binary separation , 58 r@xmath96",
    ". however , this scenario would not likely produce the phenomena seen in figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] because light scattering from the mass stream would tend to have a position angle similar to that of the disk ; therefore , we prefer a large hot spot interpretation .",
    "the 22 r@xmath96 to 33 r@xmath96 range is likely an upper limit for the size of the hot spot for several reasons .",
    "the position angle method ( see section 4.2 ) relies on using the randomization of position angles around secondary eclipse .",
    "we determined the length of time that the randomization in position angle lasts by using data from multiple orbits of the system .",
    "if the spot varies , either in size or location , on time scale similar to the orbital period , this variation would cause our estimate to be larger than the actual size of the hot spot .",
    "also , we made the assumption that the hot spot contributes only unpolarized light to the observations .",
    "it is possible that the hot spot contributes light polarized at a different position angle than light polarized in the disk .",
    "this would cause a cancellation effect to occur ; light polarized in the hot spot would cancel some of the light polarized in the disk . in this case , our estimate would again be larger than the area of the hot spot .    if the hot spot is indeed larger than 30 r@xmath96 , a portion of it may already be visible to the observer during primary eclipse . if this were the case , we would expect the polarization maxima in the affected bands to shift from phase 0.0 to an earlier phase .",
    "this line of reasoning suggests that the primary eclipse effects seen in figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] , if real , may also be due to the hot spot ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "however , such a scenario does not explain why the _ i _ band polarization maximum occurs just after primary eclipse .",
    "the _ r _ band and three - term _ v _ band fourier fits do not show an offset at primary eclipse , suggesting that the hot spot is not visible at this phase ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "we propose that the primary eclipse offsets are likely a result of the fourier fits in some bands being less well determined around primary eclipse due to incomplete phase coverage .    the position angle scatter around primary eclipse in figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] could also be interpreted as evidence that the hot spot is visible at this phase . as the system moves from primary eclipse to secondary eclipse , the amount of the hot spot visible to the observer should only increase if the time scale for changes in the hot spot is large compared to the orbital period .",
    "this suggests that if the scatter in the position angle of the 1997 august 25 observations ( squares between phases 0.000 and 0.015 in figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] ) is due to the hot spot , then a similar scatter should also exist in observations where the hot spot was fully visible during the same orbit .",
    "in particular , the 1997 august 26 ( phase 0.079 ) and 1997 august 30 ( phase 0.385 ) observations should show this effect . however , these two observations appear to have a position angle more similar to the system average than the 1997 august 25 observations .",
    "if that the mass transfer rate varies on time scales shorter than an orbital period , then the hot spot size may have changed over this five - day period to change the amount of position angle scatter .",
    "this scenario would explain the position angle scatter at primary eclipse for a single cycle , but it would not address the fact that no other orbits of the system were observed to have a position angle scatter near primary eclipse . the combination of the arguments for and against the visibility of the hot spot at primary eclipse does not clearly determine whether its effects are discernible near phase 0.0 .",
    "multiple spectropolarimetric observations from the same orbit near primary eclipse will provide more insight into the cause of this phenomena and access its repeatability .",
    "in particular , the evolution of the color index of the polarized flux through primary eclipse compared to the evolution of the color index of the total light flux may shed new light on this situation .",
    "harmanec et al ( 1996 ) derived the location of the ` roots ' of the bipolar outflows , where the bipolar outflows originate within the disk , using the h@xmath12 absorption core and the h@xmath12 emission wings seen in many epochs of spectra ( see figure 1 in @xcite for an artist s view of the location of the outflows ) .",
    "the location of the roots ( marked by a filled square in figure [ hotspotsize ] for the h@xmath12 absorption and by a filled star for h@xmath12 emission ) is in the same quadrant of the disk in which we interpret the hot spot being located .",
    "however , the location of the roots is in the interior of the disk while we suggest the hot spot is a disruption in the structure of the disk edge .",
    "certainly the bipolar outflows and the hot spot are related ; both components are the result of the system s high mass transfer rate .",
    "how far into the interior of the disk the hot spot reaches is unknown .",
    "additionally , the disk is made up of two components : a dense inner disk and an outer less dense disk @xcite .",
    "what constitutes the ` disk edge ' where the hot spot disruption occurs is unclear , although we have assumed it is the outermost edge of the disk ( whose diameter is 60 r@xmath96 ) in our size estimates . because the scattering region for the h@xmath12 line is thought to be the bipolar outflows ( hnf ) , future high precision h@xmath12 line polarization measurements may be able to link the two structures .",
    "if the hot spot location is consistent with the roots of the outflows , we expect the h@xmath12 line polarization to show a secondary minimum offset , similar to those characterizing the broadband curves ( figures [ bband ] through [ iband ] ) , while maintaining a position angle consistent with the outflows .",
    "radial velocity curves of the h@xmath12 line s polarized flux may also provide valuable insight into the relationship between the hot spot and bipolar outflows .",
    "we have presented a large new data set of polarimetric observations of @xmath0 lyr in the _ bvri _ bands and the first fourier fits to the polarimetric variations in these bands and the @xmath155876 emission line .",
    "we have interpreted the minimum in the _ bvri _ projected polarization prior to secondary eclipse and the associated position angle rotations as the first direct evidence for a hot spot on the edge of the accretion disk in the @xmath0 lyr system . using the phases of polarization minimum , the scatter of the position angle and a simple model , we have estimated the maximum size of the hot spot to be between 22 and 33 r@xmath96 across the face of the disk .",
    "more extensive polarimetric modeling of @xmath0 lyr is needed in order to fully understand these results .",
    "insights into the importance of the effects at primary eclipse and more accurate estimates of the hot spot size could be derived from such models .",

    "however , neither set of observations has provided information on the origin of the x - ray emission or observed the system at phases at which we see the hot spot effects .",
    "an x - ray light curve with more complete phase coverage will help locate the source of the x - ray emission .",
