    "capacity characterization of general wireless relay networks is a fundamental problem in network information theory .",
    "however , the capacity is not fully characterized even for the simplest network consisting of single source , single relay , and single destination @xcite . in wireless environments ,",
    "a transmit signal will be heard by multiple nodes , which we call the _ broadcast _ nature of wireless communication , and a receiver will receive the superposition of simultaneously transmitted signals from multiple nodes , which we call the _ interference _ nature of wireless communication .",
    "furthermore wireless channels may be time - varying due to _ fading _ , and there is noise at each receiver . considering all these makes the problem vary hard .    hence , one of the promising approaches is to study simplified relay networks , whose results can provide insights towards exact or approximate capacity characterization for more general wireless relay networks .",
    "let us first look at some cases that the capacity is known . for wireline relay networks or the relay networks with no broadcast and no interference",
    ", routing is enough to achieve the unicast capacity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "routing alone can not achieve the multicast capacity and network coding has been shown to be optimal in this case @xcite . for deterministic relay networks with no interference , the unicast capacity has been characterized in @xcite and the extension to the multicast case has been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "the multicast capacity of erasure networks with no interference has been also characterized in @xcite . when there is no broadcast , the unicast capacity of erasure networks has been characterized in @xcite , which is the dual network studied in @xcite .",
    "for all these mentioned networks , the unicast or multicast capacity can be interpreted as the _ max - flow min - cut theorem_.    notice that although such orthogonal transmission or reception is possible in practice by using time , frequency , or code - division techniques , it is suboptimal in general channels",
    ". therefore , simplification of wireless relay networks while preserving both broadcast and interference natures is crucially important to capture the essence of wireless communication . the simplest model that successfully reflects both broadcast and interference natures might be linear finite - field relay networks @xcite , where a node transmits an element in the finite - field and receives the sum of transmit signals in the same finite - field .",
    "recently , the work in @xcite has shown that the max - flow min - cut theorem also holds for deterministic linear finite - field relay networks .",
    "after the capacity characterization of linear finite - field relay networks , the approximate capacity of gaussian relay networks has been characterized within a constant number of bits using the quantize - random - map - and - forward by the same authors @xcite . in spite of the surging importance of multi - source relay networks , capacity characterization is much more challenging if there exist multiple source - destination ( s - d ) pairs in a network . even for linear finite - field relay networks ,",
    "the extension of the results in @xcite to the multi - source does not seem to be straightforward .",
    "notice that the main difficulty arises from the fact that the transmission of other sessions acts as _ inter - user interference _ and , as a result , the cut - set upper bound is not tight in general . due to these difficulties ,",
    "the existing capacity or approximate capacity results are limited in specific network topologies such as two - user interference channel @xcite , many - to - one interference channel @xcite , two - way channel @xcite , and two - user two - hop relay network @xcite .",
    "therefore , one of the basic questions is whether we can characterize the capacity or approximate capacity for more general network topologies or other classes of relay networks . in this paper , we study _",
    "multi - source linear finite - field relay networks with time - varying channels _ , which capture three key characteristics of wireless environment , i.e. , broadcast , interference , and fading .",
    "note that a random coding strategy , which is still optimal in single - source fading linear finite - field relay networks @xcite , does not work anymore due to the inter - user interference .",
    "as mentioned before , a fundamental issue in multi - source networks is how to manage inter - user interference in a network .",
    "we observe that fading can play an important role in mitigating such interference efficiently , that leads to the capacity characterization for certain classes of networks .",
    "more specifically , for single - hop networks , inter - user interference can be removed completely at each destination by using two particular channel instances jointly . for multi - hop networks , by using a series of particular channel instances over multiple hops , each destination can also decode its message without interference .",
    "as an example , consider the three - user linear binary - field relay network in fig .",
    "[ fig : interference_alignment_mitigation ] , where @xmath0 denotes the information bit of the @xmath1-th source and the symbol in each node denotes the transmit signal of that node . for single - hop networks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interference_alignment_mitigation ] ( a ) , by transmitting the same bit twice at each source through @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , each destination can cancel interference by adding the two received signals , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the two channel instances of the first hop and @xmath5 denotes the identity matrix .",
    "related works dealing with the inseparability of parallel interference channels can be found in @xcite and the references therein , where the idea of opportunistically pairing two channel instances , i.e. , @xmath4 , also appeared in @xcite .",
    "this can be considered as a different and simpler way of doing interference alignment @xcite . for two - hop networks , as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : interference_alignment_mitigation ] .",
    "( b ) , we notice that each destination can receive the information bit without interference if @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the channel instances of the first and second hop , respectively . similarly the interference - free communication is possible for @xmath9-hop networks by opportunistically pairing the series of channel instances from @xmath7 to @xmath10 such that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the channel instance of the @xmath13-th hop .    based on these key observations ,",
    "we propose block markov encoding and relaying schemes which make such opportunistic pairing of channel instances possible . by comparing their achievable rate regions with the cut - set upper bound ,",
    "we characterize the capacity region of single - hop networks and the sum capacity of multi - hop networks for some classes of network topologies and channel distributions . this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sys_model ] , we define the network model and state the multi - source relay problem and the notations used in the paper . in section [ sec : converse ] , we derive the general cut - set upper bound , which will be used to prove the converses in sections [ sec : achievability_single ] and [ sec : achievability_multi ] . in section [ sec : achievability_single ] , the block markov encoding scheme is proposed for single - hop networks and its achievable rate region is derived , which characterizes the capacity region for certain classes of networks . in section [ sec : achievability_multi ] , the block markov encoding and relaying scheme is proposed for multi - hop networks and its achievable rate region is derived , which characterizes the sum capacity for certain classes of networks .",
