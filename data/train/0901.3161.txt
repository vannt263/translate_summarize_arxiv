    "@xmath11 will in general be determined by the universal ( in the sense here of being twist and flavour independent @xcite , though theory dependent ) scaling function @xmath12 ( cf . for instance @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath13 ( with a factor @xmath14 for the field @xmath6 in the fundamental representation @xcite ) with this parametrisation of the t hooft coupling @xmath15 . the universal scaling @xmath12 equals in the @xmath16 sector twice the _ cusp anomalous dimension _ of the light - like wilson loops @xcite and therefore inherits this name .",
    "we denote above by dots terms which are going to zero , whilst we wish to investigate the sub - leading ( constant ) scaling @xmath17 ( for qcd see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the leading scaling @xmath12 has been constrained ( for all the values of @xmath18 ) in @xcite ( cf . also @xcite for the relation with the bethe root density ) by a linear integral equation derived from the _ asymptotic _ bethe ansatz @xcite and from the same bethe ansatz the sub - leading one @xmath17 has been shown in @xcite , after careful consideration @xcite , to enjoy a linear integral equation with the same kernel ( but different inhomogeneous term ; for an alternative approach using the non - linear integral equation @xcite , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is , of course , non - universal in the sense again that it depends explicitly on the twist @xmath10 ( and , if there are other representations than the adjoint one , on the representation carried by the field , as well as on the theory ) .",
    "yet , it will be conjectured in the following with some evidence to be wrapping - free ( at least for the smallest twist @xmath16 ) , thus sharing the destiny of @xmath12 in this respect .. ] the main evidence is coming from the agreement with the recent string computations @xcite , which should seriously allow for gauge loop wrapping effects , as they live at very large coupling @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , a very recent analysis @xcite _ @xmath19 la _ lscher has proved for the scalar twist two operator that the wrapping correction at four loops goes to zero ( like @xmath20 ) .    in any case , thanks to kotikov , lipatov , onishchenko and velizhanin @xcite it is by now well established that ( in @xmath1 sym ) @xmath21 is the same for the operators with the smallest twist @xmath16 ( and determines also that of some twist three operators , see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , all twist two operators belong to the same supermultiplet , and their anomalous dimension is expressed in terms of a universal function defined by the scalars @xmath22 and with shifted lorentz spin for gauginos @xmath23 and gauge fields @xmath24 .    still at the leading twist @xmath16 dixon , magnea and sterman @xcite have pointed out that , although not universal ( as @xmath12 ) , its _ first logarithmic integral _ , @xmath25 , equals the sub - leading correction to the logarithm of the ( diverging ) scattering amplitude ( the following is just a sketchy formula whose precise definitions and regularisation rely on @xcite or references therein , in particular for the connexion between @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 . a similar one between @xmath28 and @xmath12 ( cf .",

    "( [ subleading ] ) ) , the linear integral equation leads us to a split form of @xmath35 into a twist - dependent part and another independent of it , @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "( [ subleading ] ) below ) .",
    "the latter contains somehow the universal @xmath31 and thus might share with it , at very strong coupling , its logarithmic behaviour ( cf . below ( [ analytic ] ) and ( [ fextra ] ) which are in agreement with the string theory calculation by @xcite ) .",
    "this may lead us to the possible proposal @xmath36 \\ , , \\ ] ] with an intriguing object between square parenthesis ( and the presence of @xmath12 may be perhaps motivated by the relation of @xmath31 to a wilson loop @xcite ) .",

    "* note added : * an interesting paper @xcite appears today in the web archives .",
    "it seems to contain an analysis of the strong coupling expansions of @xmath26 in overlap with some of the results of this work .",
    "the present analysis fully relies upon the main achievements of @xcite , where it was shown that the relevant integral equations which enter the computation of the anomalous dimension at large spin are linear .",
    "let us briefly remind some results which will be useful later .    for what concerns the one loop results , we consider equation ( 3.52 ) of that paper .",
    "the meaning of such equation is that , in the high spin limit @xmath39 , the one loop density of roots is approximated , up to orders @xmath40 , by the function whose fourier transform @xmath41 reads as @xmath42 we also showed that the one loop energy , @xmath43 with the function @xmath44 in the high spin limit behaves as @xmath45 and the one loop anomalous dimension reads @xmath46 g^2   + g^2 o(s^0 )   \\label { gamma0 } \\ , .\\ ] ]",

    "as follows from the generalisation of the kotikov - lipatov identity @xcite , the relation of the function @xmath53 with the ( all - loops ) energy ( anomalous dimension ) is @xmath56 we now want to put equation ( [ skeq ] ) in a form which is suitable for analysis of both the weak and the strong coupling limit . it is convenient to restrict to the domain @xmath57 and expand @xmath53 in series of bessel functions @xmath58 with the energy ( [ e - s ] ) given by @xmath59 on the other hand , for what concerns the coefficients @xmath60 , after some simple calculations we find the following system of equations @xmath61 in writing ( [ s0system ] ) we used the notations @xmath62 the structure of the forcing terms appearing in the linear system ( [ s0system ] ) suggests that its solution and - consequently - the ( all - loops ) anomalous dimension can be split as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the ( coefficient of the ) solution of the bes equation @xcite , @xmath65 is the ( coefficient of the ) first generalised scaling density @xcite and the extra coefficients @xmath66 are solutions of the following system @xmath67 from the splitting ( [ splitting ] ) of their solution , we obtain that the all loops energy at high spin is @xmath68 where @xmath12 is the cusp anomalous dimension , @xmath69 is the first generalised scaling function and @xmath70 comes from the solution of ( [ sextsystem ] ) . in other terms , the sub - leading correction is worth @xmath71 with explicit mention to its twist dependence ( since @xmath26 does not depend on @xmath10 ) .    in the next sections we will analyse the weak and the strong coupling expansion of @xmath17 .",
    "since the system ( [ sextsystem ] ) is linear ( as the original linear integral equation @xcite ) , it can be systematically and very easily expanded at small @xmath18 , giving the weak coupling ( convergent ) series of @xmath17 ( via ( [ subleading ] ) ) .",
    "this kind of computations can be automatised by using a program for the symbolic manipulation in order to go on to an arbitrary order .    in view of ( [ subleading ] ) , it is natural to start by the twist two formula up to the order @xmath72 : @xmath73 and we end up with the general twist expansion ( we also expanded @xmath74 according to @xcite ) @xmath75 importantly , this expansion for twist @xmath76 agrees with those up to four loops present in the literature and checked by different means ( cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "thanks to @xcite we can also argue that for twist two ( at least up to four loops ) @xmath26 enjoys the property of being wrapping free , and we would like to conjecture the same in general about @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , last but not least , after the completion of this work we became aware that a five loop calculation ( wrapping inclusive ) on twist @xmath78 would exactly confirm the expansion of this section .",
    "let us pass to consider the strong coupling limit of ( [ sextsystem ] ) . from the results in appendix",
    "a , we get that the leading contribution at large @xmath18 in the forcing terms of ( [ sextsystem ] ) is @xmath79 which allows to write down the following analytic leading behaviour @xmath80 where @xmath12 is the cusp anomalous dimension at strong coupling @xcite and the dots denotes contributions of order @xmath18 or smaller .",
    "this important point will be clarified in the remaining part of the section .    in order to analyse the next to leading terms of @xmath26 at large @xmath18",
    ", we solve numerically the linear system ( [ sextsystem ] ) .",
    "indeed , this system is amenable for the usual numerical treatment as developed in @xcite .",
    "the kernel is the same as in the study of the universal scaling function , settling any issue about convergence .",
    "what changes now is the nature of the forcing terms , which is expected to produce some subtle effects at strong coupling . in particular , as explained in appendix a , the forcing term which contains @xmath81 shows a logarithmic leading asymptotic behaviour for @xmath82 .",
    "a ( numerically ) clean way to study the system at large @xmath18 is to explicitly subtract such a logarithmic dependence in equations ( [ sextsystem ] ) .",
    "we are then led to consider the objects @xmath83 , satisfying the linear system @xmath84 with such a subtraction we have a simple expression for @xmath85 , @xmath86 where @xmath12 is the usual cusp anomalous dimension and @xmath87 , supposed to be free of logarithms , can be easily studied numerically ( a plot of the complete function @xmath85 in the range @xmath88 $ ] can be found in fig .  1 together with a magnification of the weak - coupling behaviour ) .",
    "from a general point of view , it is likely to expect that @xmath89 can be expanded in powers of @xmath18 as follows , @xmath90 the usual numerical analysis @xcite , including up to @xmath91 bessel functions in the neumann expansion , gives the following best fit coefficients : @xmath92 inserting this expansion into ( [ fextra ] ) we obtain @xmath93 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the catalan s constant and @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "now , we may also infer the plausible analytic values @xmath97 in particular , for twist two this value of @xmath98 entails the non - published evaluation @xmath99 by n. gromov , reported in the added note of @xcite .    eventually , for generic twist @xmath10 plugging into ( [ subleading ] ) the asymptotic value of the first generalised scaling function @xmath100 @xcite",

    "\\label { efinal}\\ ] ] this shows clearly how , in this asymptotic expansion , the only trace of the twist comes up in the piece @xmath102 and thus cancels out completely , at order @xmath103 , in the asymptotic ( large @xmath18 ) expansion of @xmath104 .",
    "this cancellation is due to the simple asymptotic expansion @xmath100 @xcite and holds for any @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , it makes possible that the constant term in @xmath104 at order @xmath103 be @xmath105 for any twist and thus future comparison with string theory ( which does not distinguish between null and small values of @xmath10 @xcite ) .",

    "in the present work we have performed a detailed study of the sub - leading ( constant ) contribution to the anomalous dimension of the twist operator in the large spin expansion .    to this aim",
    ", we fully exploited the results obtained in @xcite in order to write down a linear integral equation for @xmath17 .",
    "this approach allowed us to study its weak - coupling expansion up to the order @xmath107 ( and even further ) , and to access the strong coupling behaviour by means of a modification of well established numerical techniques .",
    "an entire range plot is depicted by fig .  1 .",
    "the strong coupling regime is of particular interest , because it shows a leading logarithmic behaviour ( with the t hooft coupling ) , that we are able to single out analytically by inspecting the structure of the inhomogeneous term in the linear integral equation ( see appendix a).moreover , relying on the numerical analysis we are in the position to disentangle the terms of the asymptotic expansion ; in particular , we confirm the string result in @xcite , additionally fix the constant @xmath108 for the twist @xmath109 case and understand how this constant is the same for any other twist .",
    "it is also important to stress that our computations , based on the asymptotic bethe ansatz , are in full agreement with previous findings .",
    "finally , our formalism also allows the treatment and can be seen as a particular case of the high spin and large twist case , when the ratio between the logarithm of the spin and the twist is fixed : this is the subject of the contemporaneous paper @xcite .",
