    "the quantum informational primitive of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows two parties ( alice and bob ) to distill a secret key using an untrusted quantum channel and an authenticated classical channel @xcite .",
    "various forms of qkd have been proposed and experimentally realized in laboratories and under real - life field conditions @xcite , and they can be roughly divided into two different categories which depend on the actual measurement strategy at bob s station : measurement of a discrete variable ( dv )  the photon number  carried out by photon counters or measurement of a continuous variable ( cv ) @xcite  the field quadratures  performed by a homodyne detector .",
    "they are referred to as dvqkd and cvqkd , respectively .    while dvqkd is the most matured scheme in terms of security proofs  @xcite , secure communication distance @xcite and real - life field tests @xcite , the scheme of cvqkd is rapidly becoming a serious competitor due to recent promising developments .",
    "this includes the recent advances in deriving composable security proofs @xcite , the development of very efficient post - processing algorithms for the distillation of a secret shared key from the raw key @xcite , the implementations of long - distance qkd @xcite and the recent developments of more advanced protocols such as measurement - device - independent cvqkd @xcite and squeezed states qkd  @xcite . moreover , most protocols of cvqkd benefit from the fact that the associated technology required for real - world integration is based on standard telecommunication components .",
    "coherent state based cvqkd protocols can be distinguished by the different input alphabets .",
    "previous proposals have included discrete @xcite as well as continuous @xcite modulation patterns of gaussian states in phase space .",
    "most of these schemes are based on the modulation of states in conjugate bases , similarly to the famous bb84 protocol @xcite where a polarization eigenstate is modulated in conjugate bases . in bb84 ,",
    "the swapping between conjugate bases is an absolute necessity for establishing security , but this is not the case for the modulation of gaussian states . in this case , the modulated states are not eigenstates of the modulation basis ( in contrast to bb84 ) but non - orthogonal , and thus the basic non - orthogonality requirement for secure communication is fulfilled even in a single basis @xcite .",
    "single - quadrature modulation has been considered for a two - state protocol with coherent states @xcite and for the continuous modulation of squeezed states @xcite followed by homodyne detection .    in this letter",
    "we develop a protocol using modulated coherent states in a single quadrature .",
    "our security analysis includes excess and preparation noise , and we present a proof - of - principle experimental implementation of the protocol using both homodyne and heterodyne detection .",
    "single - quadrature cvqkd is highly relevant as it allows for a simplification of the required technology at the sending station and , thus , leads to an important reduction in the cost . for a dual - quadrature gaussian modulation scheme ,",
    "an amplitude as well as a phase modulator is needed while the single - quadrature scheme can be implemented with a single modulator , e.g.  leaving out the amplitude modulator .",
    "this constitutes a significant reduction in complexity and cost as an amplitude modulator is based on an interferometric configuration ( that must be stabilized ) and is very expensive in terms of optical power consumption .    in preparation of this manuscript we discovered that the idea of a single quadrature cvqkd protocol has been independently developed by usenko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the implications of an asymmetric channel are considered .",
    "we finalized our security analysis with inspiration from this work .",
    "we consider the prepare - and - measure cvqkd protocol illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "random numbers drawn from a one - dimensional gaussian alphabet are used to modulate the phase quadrature , @xmath0 , at alice s station , thereby preparing independent coherent states along a line in phase space .",
    "this is in stark contrast to previous protocols where a two - dimensional gaussian distribution is used to drive phase and amplitude quadratures .",
    "the prepared states are sent to bob who performs a coherent detection of the quadratures , either using a heterodyne detector or a homodyne detector that switches between an amplitude and a phase quadrature measurement .",
    "the list of data obtained by bob ( when he measured the p quadrature ) is correlated with the list of alice , and this correlation is subsequently used to generate a secret key by means of error reconciliation and privacy amplification .",
    "the security of the scheme can be addressed by using the theoretical equivalence between the prepare - and - measure scheme and an entanglement - based scheme  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . in the entanglement - based scheme",
    ", alice prepares an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state of variance @xmath1 , keeps one mode of the epr state to herself and sends the other mode to bob . if alice performs a heterodyne measurement on her mode ( that is projecting it onto a coherent state ) , the remaining mode will form a 2d gaussian distribution of coherent states while a homodyne measurement at alice will form a 1d gaussian distribution of squeezed states . a 1d distribution of coherent states",
    "can thus be realized by performing a local squeezing operation with a squeezing parameter of @xmath2{\\mu'})$ ] onto the second mode before it is sent to bob .",
    "assuming that the covariance matrix of the epr state has the symmetric form @xmath3 with @xmath4 then the local squeezing transforms it to the matrix @xmath5{\\mu ' } } & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{\\mu ' } & 0 & -\\sqrt[4]{\\mu ' } \\sqrt{\\mu ' - 1 } \\\\",

    "such an attack can be executed by a local unitary equivalent to an asymmetric beam splitter with one mode of an epr state controlled by eve in the secondary input port .",
    "she also has control over the beam splitting ratio and the degree of asymmetricity , and is limited only by the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "eve keeps the other mode of her epr state in a quantum memory and interferes the first mode with the coherent states sent by alice .",
    "the interfered mode is saved in another quantum memory .",
    "eve s information gain in the limit of infinitely many uses of the channel is upper bounded by the holevo quantity @xcite .    in this asymptotic limit ,",
    "the asymptotic equipartition property applies and both the shannon and the von neumann entropy are well defined quantities @xcite .",
    "finite key sizes have a subtle impact on the security proofs @xcite which will not be considered in this paper . as a first approximation , neglecting these issues , one arrives at the following bound on the secret key rate  @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the reconciliation efficiency and @xmath8 is the classical mutual information between alice and bob expressed through the shannon entropy of the corresponding classical stochastic variables of the measurements @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is the holevo quantity @xcite between alice ( bob ) and eve for direct ( reverse ) reconciliation , which can be expressed by the von neumann entropy @xmath10 of the quantum state @xmath11 , @xmath12  @xcite . for gaussian states with zero mean",
    ", @xmath11 can be completely described by its covariance matrix @xmath13 .",

    "we include trusted preparation noise in our model to account for its presence in the experimental implementation  @xcite . theoretically ,",

    ", this beam splitter will of course substitute part of the epr state with vacuum noise , but an appropriate redefinition of the system parameters makes this error insignificant .",

    "firstly , the classical mutual information between alice and bob is , after some algebra , found to be @xmath45    in the limit of @xmath46 and @xmath47 this is similar to the expression one would expect from a dual quadrature protocol with half the alphabet . for heterodyne detection",
    "the expression is quite similar , @xmath48 with the addition of a unit of vacuum .",
    "the relevant transmission in both cases is the one in the @xmath0-quadrature , since this is the encoded quadrature .",
    "similarly , only the excess noise in the @xmath0 quadrature degrades the mutual information .",
    "however , the excess noise in the conjugate quadrature has a profound impact on the security , which will be elaborated on later .",
    "the expression for the holevo bound is significantly more complicated .",
    "we begin by considering the quantity @xmath49 , which denotes the von neumann entropy of eve s epr state .",
    "if we assume that the eavesdropper is able to purify the global state , it is easy to show that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the von neumann entropy of the total multimode system of alice , bob and the epr state which injects the preparation noise .",
    "purification is a useful technique in this case because it allows one to estimate the information gain of the eavesdropper without having access to her measurements . because of the added complication of preparation noise , there is no ( short ) closed expression for the von neumann entropy of this state .",
    "the symplectic spectrum of @xmath52 , which represents this global state is easily calculated numerically , for a given choice of channel and input parameters .",
    "similarly , purification allows the conditional von neumann entropies to be written as @xmath53 . again , since the symplectic eigenvalues , which are used to calculate the von neumann entropies , do not permit short analytical expressions , they are calculated numerically and inserted into eqs .  , and to calculate the secret key rate .",
    "since preparation noise has been incorporated into the security analysis , it makes sense to also investigate the case of direct , rather than reverse , reconciliation since it is known from dual quadrature protocols that it offers an advantage in cases of extremely large preparation noise @xcite .",
    "this is done by considering the conditional entropy @xmath54 rather than @xmath53 , but otherwise offers no additional computational complications .",
    "a security proof for a dual quadrature protocol usually assumes symmetry between the quadratures , but for the presented protocol this is naturally not the case . the fact that only one quadrature is encoded has an important implication , in the sense that the squeezed epr correlations in eq .   in the amplitude quadrature",
    "are not accessible to alice and bob .",
    "in other words , they have no way of estimating @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is estimated as normal , and the variance of the amplitude quadrature has to be monitored to detect the level of excess noise in this quadrature .",
    "however , monitoring the variance alone is not enough to determine @xmath39 .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to place a bound on the possible values of @xmath39 , through heisenberg s inequality . in the covariance matrix description",
    "the inequality has the form @xmath55 , i.e.  the matrix @xmath56 must be positive semi - definite .",
    "the physicality is tested by a simple numerical determination of the eigenvalues of this matrix , as they must be non - negative for @xmath52 to be physical . with this bound one",

    "[ fig : tptqgrid](b ) there is a clear increase in the size of the region of physicality .",
    "if neither excess nor preparation noise is present , the bound enforces the relation @xmath58 .",
    "however , even minute amounts of noise will widen the bound and since @xmath39 is controllable by the eavesdropper a worst case scenario approach is taken and @xmath39 is thus always chosen to give the lowest possible rate .          in fig .",
    "[ fig : rrtheory ] we plot the secret key rate as a function of channel attenuation for different detection strategies both for the 2d and the 1d gaussian modulation patterns , using reverse reconciliation . in fig .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappatheory ] . from this",

    "[ fig : tptqgrid ] , [ fig : noisetheoryrr ] and [ fig : kappatheory ] , it is clear that a single modulated quadrature combined with the right channel offers quantum security , albeit slightly reduced from a protocol using both quadratures . in general",

    "half of the measurements ( @xmath62-quadrature measurements ) are not used for key generation but only for state estimation .",
    "this naturally reduces the rate by a factor of two .",
    "it can , however , be partially compensated by introducing an asymmetry in the heterodyne detector or the switching probability of the homodyne detector .",
    "homodyne detection was done by brightening the local oscillator while dimming the signal beam to satisfy the brightness approximation .",

    "these outputs represent measurements of the amplitude and phase quadrature amplitude , respectively , when both beams have the same optical power . in the homodyne measurement",
    ", @xmath62 and @xmath0 quadrature data is found in post - processing by the difference of the two sampled data streams .",
    "in addition to these measured data ( at bob ) , we also recorded the data resulting from the white noise generator ( at alice ) .",
    "the vacuum reference was measured by disconnecting the white noise generator from the phase modulator .",
    "after that the phase modulation was first set to a modulation variance of @xmath72db above vacuum which set the @xmath73 transmission value .",
    "for heterodyning , the modulation variance was subsequently reduced to simulate optical loss in the channel . since",
    "only coherent states were involved in our implementation this procedure is equivalent to introducing optical loss . however , this scheme enabled us to perform heterodyne detection in the form described above , since the requirement of having the same optical power in reference and signal beam was fulfilled .",
    "for homodyne detection , loss was introduced via beamsplitters and waveplates , as there is no power requirement in the signal beam in this configuration .    for each measurement",
    "run we recorded @xmath74 samples and estimated the excess noise and transmission of the channel .",
    "the magnitude of the correlations directly defines the level of the mutual information , through the formula @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the variance of bob s measurement in the signal quadrature , @xmath77 is the variance of alice s input signal , and @xmath78 is the covariance between the data sets .",
    "the preparation noise was determined at @xmath73 transmission where no excess noise introduced by the eavesdropper is present .",
    "this noise level is calculated by subtracting the ( properly scaled ) input with the output . in the limit of perfect correlations",
    ", one would expect such a subtraction to yield zero .",
    "any residual variance is therefore to be regarded as noise .",
    "if the correlations are poor , the preparation noise consequently goes up . for transmissions lower than unity , the combined excess and preparation noise is again determined by subtraction .",
    "the scaling of the preparation noise with transmission is known , so any leftover noise in the combined noise must be ascribed to the eavesdropper , i.e.  excess noise .       and",
