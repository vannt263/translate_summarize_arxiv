    "there is compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe . already in 1933 , @xcite had collected enough data to postulate the presence of more mass than what could be inferred from visible galaxies . over the past 80 years , additional observations ranging from the rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite to large - scale structure @xcite seem to point in the same direction .",
    "one outstanding prediction of cosmological simulations using cold dark matter particles is that the milky way halo should be heavily populated with thousands of smaller dark matter subhalos as a result of the hierarchical assembly process @xcite . dark matter",
    "subhalos would include any dark matter configuration , from those hosting the largest known dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the milky way to the lightest predicted dark matter substructures with masses around @xmath6 @xcite . conceptually in this scenario , the bulk of the subhalo population is made up by small - scale dark matter substructures with limited or null star formation , which would be almost impossible to detect in existing optical surveys .",
    "should dark matter subhalos without major star formation episodes exist in large numbers , one of the only ways to detect them might be by tracking gamma rays from dark matter annihilation .",
    "the all - sky coverage and unprecedented sensitivity of the large area telescope ( lat ) , on board nasa s _ fermi _  satellite , is enabling the most effective search for potential dark matter subhalos to date .",
    "the obvious place to look for subhalo candidates is among the 3033 sources detected and characterized in the third _ fermi_lat catalog ( 3fgl ) @xcite , in particular , among the 1010 sources listed as unassociated with counterparts of known gamma - ray - producing source classes .",
    "it is plausible that after years of observations , _ fermi _  has already detected dark matter subhalos .",
    "the challenge now is to locate them @xcite .",
    "previous attempts to pinpoint dark matter subhalos have systematically searched for unassociated sources with spectra that are consistent with dark matter annihilation @xcite .",
    "machine - learning classification targeting dark matter subhalos has also been performed using @xmath7-means clustering in the first _ fermi _  lat  catalog ( 1fgl ) @xcite and random forest in the second _ fermi _  lat  catalog ( 2fgl ) @xcite . here",
    "we present an application of machine - learning classifiers that aims to chart all galactic sources outside the plane in the 3fgl . by specifically isolating 3fgl objects at high latitude",
    "we hope to reduce the search space for dark matter subhalos and unknown source classes as much as possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the spectral prescription for locating galactic objects outside the plane in the 3fgl . in section 3",
    "we introduce machine - learning classifiers .",
    "section 4 covers training sample and variable selection . in sections 5 and 6",
    "we discuss cross validation and prediction results . in section 7 , we discuss possible interpretations of the results including a visual search for ultra - faint dwarf galaxy and globular cluster counterparts , as well as direct comparison with statistics from pulsar population synthesis models .",
    "we also place constraints on the annihilation cross section by comparing the number of potential subhalos to predictions from cosmological simulations .",
    "finally , in section 8 we present our conclusions and outlook .",
    "at high galactic latitude , the totality of known galactic gamma - ray emitters correspond to pulsars or globular clusters hosting msps @xcite .",
    "two additional undiscovered gamma - ray - producing source classes have been postulated to exist : dark matter subhalos @xcite and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "dark matter annihilation is expected to dominate the gamma - ray signal from both known galactic dwarf galaxies and from dark matter subhalos .",
    "if two dark matter particles annihilate through typical standard model channels , the decay and hadronization of these particles would create a gamma - ray spectrum that extends up to the rest mass of the dark matter particle with a sharp cutoff @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section , @xmath10 is the dark matter particle mass , and @xmath11 is the gamma - ray yield per annihilation and depends on the particle physics model under consideration @xcite .",
    "the second part of the equation , or the so - called astrophysical factor @xmath12 , corresponds to the integration of the dark matter density squared @xmath13 along the line of sight @xmath14 over a solid angle @xmath15 .",
    "the nearest and/or most massive dark matter subhalos would be easiest to detect even if they host no stars .    figure 1 shows the predicted gamma - ray spectrum for the annihilation of 30 gev dark matter particles into bottom quark ( @xmath5 ) pairs",
    ". the spectral shape from dark matter annihilation would be quite recognizable .",
    "unfortunately , a dark matter annihilation spectrum around a few gev would not be unique .",
    "most known gamma - ray pulsars display nearly identical spectra with sharp exponential cutoffs @xcite . to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have overlaid in figure 1 a typical msp spectrum drawn from the second _ fermi _  lat  pulsar catalog ( 2fpc ) @xcite .",
    "this pulsar - dark matter spectral degeneracy has driven a lively debate about the origin of excess gev emission at the galactic center @xcite ; however , the spectral degeneracy permeates to other astrophysical settings beyond the galactic center . indeed ,",
    "because of this gamma - ray degeneracy , one can not expect to distinguish spectrally between pulsars , low - luminosity globular clusters hosting msps , ultra - faint dwarf galaxies , and dark matter subhalos .",
    "by contrast , none of the known extragalactic sources have exponentially curved lat spectra , except for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) pulsar @xcite .",
    "variability is also a far more likely characteristic of extragalactic objects than of galactic objects at high latitude .",
    "one can turn the spectral degeneracy between some galactic classes and the marked contrast with extragalactic objects into assets by using known pulsar and globular cluster gamma - ray spectra to help hunt down undiscovered dark matter subhalos and ultra - faint dwarf galaxies in the 3fgl with machine - learning classifiers .",
    "we describe such search strategy next .",
    "by machine learning classifier , we denote any algorithm with the ability to perform accurate predictions , after having trained on the properties of a well - known training set of data . for most of this work",
    ", we will concentrate on supervised machine learning classifiers or sets of models that can input a list of variables of a data set and output a prediction model that best describes the relationship between the variables and known classes . for an overview of popular machine - learning classifiers ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . among the plethora of available machine - learning classifiers ,",
    "we have settled on two highly accurate variants of classification trees , i.e. random forest and xgboost @xcite .",
    "random forest is an ensemble learning method that grows a large forest of randomized classification trees and aggregates their predictions made from a list of input variables @xcite .",
    "individual classification trees are constructed by randomly sampling @xmath7 variables from @xmath16 input variables at each node @xcite .",
    "the forest selects a random sample with replacement from the original training set using bagging ( bootstrap aggregating ) .",
    "any data left out of the bootstrap sample helps to measure the internal accuracy directly in the form of an out - of - bag estimates . to classify an object , each tree in the forest issues a prediction . the predictions from all trees for the same object",
    "are then collected and a class is determined through a majority decision . aside from being easy to use , random forest provides outstanding performance and the ability to track proximity matrices .",
    "we adopted the _",
    "randomforest _ set of routines , which implements the original random forest for classification and regression to the r language @xcite .",
    "the final model is based on 1000 trees , with a total of @xmath17 variables sampled at each split , where @xmath18 is the final number of variables .",
    "the extreme gradient boosting xgboost is a modified version of gradient boosting @xcite .",
    "the fundamental difference with random forest is that xgboost uses boosting to reweigh the training set sequentially @xcite .",
    "in contrast to bagging , boosting uses all instances at each repetition but issues a weight for each instance in the training set .",
    "these evolving weights adjust the learners to focus on different instances at each pass .",
    "one of the key problems in tree classifiers is how to find the best split at each node . to expedite this decision",
    ", xgboost finds the best solution over all the possible splits according to percentiles of variable distribution @xcite . in all experiments ,",
    "we boost trees with a learning rate @xmath19 and a maximum number of iterations set to 5 .",
    "in order to construct a base training set for the galactic population outside the plane , we use 143 3fgl pulsars identified by pulsations ( psrs ) , 15 3fgl globular clusters ( glcs ) , and 24 3fgl pulsars with no pulsation seen in lat yet ( psrs ) .",
    "the extragalactic set includes 1745 sources from all agn classes in the 3fgl .",
    "it contains 3 non - blazar active galaxies ( agn ) , 573 blazar candidates of uncertain type ( bcu , bcu ) , 660 bl lacs ( bll , bll ) , 484 flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq , fsrq ) , 5 narrow - line seyferts 1 ( nlsy1,nlsy1 ) , 15 radio galaxies ( rdg , rdg ) , 3 soft spectrum radio quasars ( ssrq ) , 1 compact steep spectrum quasar ( css ) , and 1 seyfert galaxy ( sey ) .",
    "the entire dataset is divided into a training set ( a random sample of 2/3 of the total ) and a testing set ( remaining 1/3 of the total ) .",
    "variable selection is essential to machine - learning classifiers .",
    "starting from a set of parameters or variables the algorithm must be able to classify an object into one of a set of distinct classes .",
    "for any classification problem , there are certain variables that best capture a specific class of objects .",
    "the advantage of using machine - learning classifiers is that the algorithms can explore the entire variable space at once .",
    "initially we started with a total of 35 3fgl variables , excluding positional , uncertainty and descriptive variables . in view of the inherent difficulties in sampling gamma - ray spectra for any given object",
    ", we augmented this original variable set with eight additional derived variables defined by hardness ratios ` hr_{ij}`= @xmath20 and flux ratios ` fr_{ij } ` = ` flux_{i}`/ ` flux_j ` between consecutive @xmath21 bands for 0.10.3 gev ( band 1 ) , 0.31 gev ( band 2 ) , 13 gev ( band 3 ) , 310 gev ( band 4 ) , and 10100 gev ( band 5 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the out - of - bag error as a function of the number of variables used .",
    "the out - of - bag estimates tend to asymptote to a minimum at @xmath22 .",
    "the value shown for @xmath23 corresponds to the optimal scenario when using only ` signif_curve ` and ` variability_index ` as variables . for each classifier",
    ", we also quantify feature importance to pinpoint the features that best discriminate between classes .",
    "table 1 ranks variable importance ( from most to least important ) in terms of the improvement achieved from each variable or @xmath24 for all splits and trees for the xgboost model . for comparison , table 2",
    "ranks the overall percentage decrease in accuracy rate averaged over all trees or @xmath25 measured by random forest @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , the variable rankings are not identical but there is commonality on the top variables .",
    "the differences are an indication of the distinct paths the classifiers follow to achieve a successful prediction . after exploring different variable combinations , we find that the variables that most clearly differentiate galactic and extragalactic populations include ` signif_curve ` , ` variability_index ` , and ` spectral_index ` .",
    "we also include flux ratios and hardness ratios for five energy bands in our final models .",
    "cc     + ` signif_curve ` & 0.47 + ` variability_index ` & 0.26 + ` fr_{45 } ` & 0.10 + ` spectral_index ` & 0.08 + ` fr_{12 } ` & 0.03 + ` fr_{23 } ` & 0.03 + ` pivot_energy ` & 0.02 + ` fr_{34 } ` & 0.01 +    cc + ` variability_index ` & 0.58 + ` fr_{45 } ` & 0.40 + ` signif_curve ` & 0.40 + ` pivot_energy ` & 0.33 + ` hr_{45 } ` & 0.30 + ` spectral_index ` & 0.26 + ` hr_{23 } ` & 0.24 + ` fr_{23 } ` & 0.22 +",
    "during initial tests , we quickly found out that random forest suffered from the fact that the training set was highly imbalanced , i.e. 90% extragalactic versus 10% galactic trainees .",
    "as constructed , random forest tends to build classification trees dominated by the majority class . to alleviate this problem , we artificially increased the training set using over - sampling as implemented in the synthetic minority over - sampling technique ( @xmath26 ) @xcite",
    ". @xmath26 creates a much larger synthetic minority class by replicating the existing sample using five nearest neighbors . with the @xmath26 approach we were able to achieve a test set error rate of 2.8% for random forest .",
    "class imbalanced was not a problem for xgboost and the training was done with the original training and testing samples , reaching a test set error rate of 3.3% .",
    "figure 3 shows the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves for both classifiers @xcite . at various threshold values",
    ", we plot the true positive rate ( the fraction of correctly identified ) versus the false positive rate ( the fraction of candidates incorrectly classified ) . as shown , random forest slightly outperforms xgboost , but only after taking into account the class imbalance .",
    "a perfect classifier would have a true positive rate equal to one .",
    "a complementary measure of accuracy can be accomplished by applying random forest and xgboost retroactively to unassociated sources listed in the 1fgl and 2fgl . since a number of _ fermi _ discoveries",
    "have been made since those early catalogs were first released , we can now directly measure how many high - latitude galactic candidates selected using machine - learning classifiers have been confirmed either as pulsars or globular clusters .",
    "out of 22 galactic candidates above @xmath27 significance picked by the classifiers in the 1fgl , 18 have been confirmed as pulsars to date .",
    "this implies that the accuracy achieved by the classifiers exceeds 80% at that significance level . in figure 4",
    "we show the number of 3fgl galactic candidates at @xmath28 as a function of flux . for comparison , 1fgl and 2fgl candidates using the same machine - learning classifiers are also shown .",
    "we can clearly see the tremendous progress in pulsar discoveries since the release of the 1fgl based on 11 months of _ fermi _  lat  data .",
    "next we applied the classifier models to the entire 3fgl unassociated sample . in order to focus on sources outside the galactic plane , we excluded unassociated 3fgl sources within 5@xmath29  of the plane .",
    "this cut leaves us with a starting list of 675 unassociated objects from a total of 1010 .",
    "since we are only interested in high - quality predictions , we further impose the condition that in order to retain a galactic candidate both classifiers must agree ( probability @xmath30 that the object is galactic in both classifiers ) . finally , we only report predictions for 3fgl objects with a detection significance @xmath31 .    based on these criteria ,",
    "we find a total of 34 high - latitude galactic candidates with energy flux @xmath32 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 between 100 mev and 100 gev at @xmath0 .",
    "table 3 lists these candidates . to check for consistency , we compared our list of candidates with results from spectral fitting of 3fgl unassociated sources @xcite , as well as with pulsar predictions using a combination of random forest and logistic regression @xcite .",
    "the list of galactic candidates at high galactic latitude is in good agreement with both of these works .",
    "armed with these 34 potential high - latitude galactic objects , we can now place the results in context of known and hypothesized gamma - ray source classes .",
    "one possibility is that some of these newly discovered objects are either low - luminosity globular clusters @xcite or ultra - faint dwarf galaxies . in order to examine this possibility",
    "we have visually inspected digitized sky survey ( dss ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images @xcite .",
    "we confined our visual inspection to the area enclosed within the 3fgl 95% uncertainty ellipses of the 34 candidates .",
    "our search mainly focused on visually diffuse and extended objects in the optical , but none were found at least 1 magnitude above the dss optical limit .",
    "it is important to note that the visual approach is limited to objects that can easily standout in the images but it is severely hampered when trying to reach ultra - faint dwarf galaxies as the ones detected by sdss @xcite and des @xcite .    for six optical fields with reliable multi - band sdss photometry ( 3fgl j0318.1 + 0252 , 3fgl j1120.6 + 0713 , 3fgl j1225.9 + 2953 , 3fgl j1625.10021 , 3fgl j2103.71113 , 3fgl j2212.5 + 0703 ) , we systematically searched for unusual concentrations of rr lyrae .",
    "rr lyrae stars are excellent distance indicators , as well as superb tracers of stellar substructures away from the galactic plane @xcite . in order to pinpoint rr lyrae star candidates within the 3fgl 95% uncertainty ellipses , we adopted a simple sdss color cut scheme based on equations 14 derived by @xcite .",
    "we find no anomalous excess of rr lyrae stars in any of the 6 fields with significance greater than @xmath33 .",
    "it is quite possible that fainter stellar structures with very few members could be present below the optical detection limits @xcite .      given the ultra - fast pace of pulsar discoveries with _ fermi _ , it is not surprising that at least five of the galactic candidates identified here have been already confirmed as pulsars since the 3fgl release ( see table 3 ) . in the 3fgl",
    "there are 89 pulsars listed at @xmath0 with energy flux larger than @xmath34 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 between 100 mev and 100 gev . of the 89 known high - latitude gamma - ray pulsars ,",
    "77 are msps with spin period @xmath35 ( s ) and spin - down rate @xmath36 satisfying log@xmath37 + 19.5 + 2.5 log@xmath38 p @xmath39 0 @xcite .",
    "an addition of 34 pulsars would bring the total number of _ fermi _  lat  detected pulsars at high latitude to 123 .    in order to compare this number to theoretical predictions from pulsar simulations",
    ", we performed a new population synthesis of msps @xcite in a similar fashion as in the study of @xcite .",
    "however , we have used improved pulsar spin - down formalism , empirical gamma - ray luminosity , and beam geometries of the high - energy emission models of the high - altitude slot gap ( two pole caustic ) @xcite ( tpc ) , of the outer gap @xcite ( og ) , and of the pair - starved polar cap @xcite ( pspc ) .",
    "in addition to the radio beam geometry used in @xcite , we implemented a radio aligned model ( altpc ) in which the radio emission has the same geometry as the high - energy tpc model .",
    "the characteristics of thirteen radio surveys provided the detection thresholds for simulated radio pulsars , and the _ fermi _ point source threshold map in the 2fpc was scaled for various observing periods to determine the detection of simulated gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "the models predict that _ fermi _  lat  should detect anywhere from 100 to 126 msps in four years with an energy flux larger than @xmath40 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 at @xmath0 ( table 4 ) . assuming that 85% of the 34 galactic candidates are msps , as is observed in the 3fgl catalog at high galactic latitude , then the total number of 3fgl msps at @xmath0 would be @xmath41 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "therefore , the simulated pulsar population is in excellent agreement with the projected number of 3fgl msp detections .",
    "in fact , depending on the pulsar emission model there is some wiggle room ( @xmath42420 ) for additional 3fgl msp discoveries at high galactic latitude .",
    "below @xmath27 and above @xmath43 significance , the machine - learning classifiers find an additional 33 galactic candidates that could easily cover this difference .",
    "the locations of the 34 high - significance galactic candidates and known 3fgl pulsars at @xmath0 are shown in figure 5 .      taking advantage of the predictions in @xcite , we can also directly compare the number of galactic candidates at @xmath28 to the expected number of nearby subhalos detectable by _ fermi _  lat  after four years of observations . because our classifiers rely on the 3fgl variables , we are only sensitive to dark matter annihilation in the 100 mev300 gev energy range .",
    "it is important to note that no significantly exponentially curved candidates at energies @xmath44 gev have been found in any of the hard _",
    "fermi_-lat source catalogs @xcite . as in the original approach outlined in @xcite , the subhalo predictions in @xcite",
    "rely on the distribution of hundreds of thousands of subhalos that were simulated in 6 ultra - highly resolved milky - way sized halos as part of the aquarius project @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the number of detectable aquarius subhalos as a function of _ fermi _  lat  flux and galactic latitude .",
    "recently , @xcite used results of the via lactea ii simulation @xcite scaled to the planck 2015 cosmological parameters and found a slightly smaller number of detectable subhalos , but still consistent with the aquarius results considering the range of assumptions involved . for our comparison of high - latitude candidates with dark matter predictions ,",
    "we removed recently detected pulsars from table 3 .",
    "this brings down the number of @xmath28 subhalo candidates from 17 to 14 .",
    "figure 6 shows the upper limits on @xmath9 for dark matter masses @xmath10 between 30 gev and 10 tev annihilating into a bottom quark ( @xmath5 ) final states based on the detection of 14 potential subhalo candidates at @xmath28 .",
    "note that these limits would only be slightly better if one includes the role of halo substructure to boost the subhalo annihilation flux @xcite .",
    "more precisely , following @xcite , we estimate at most a factor @xmath45 10% stronger limits when boosting the annihilation signal in the mass range @xmath46@xmath47 @xmath48 . for comparison",
    ", we also show constraints if eventually no dark matter subhalos turn up in the 3fgl from the aquarius @xcite and via lactea ii simulations @xcite respectively .",
    "while the current limit is not constraining enough to rule out the canonical thermal relic cross section at energies below 100 gev @xcite , the curve is starting to approach competitive values . indeed",
    ", further associations of some of these candidates with conventional astrophysical sources may only lead to more stringent limits .    as noted by @xcite",
    ", there are significant uncertainties in the number of predicted dark matter subhalos that could shift these dark matter limits by a factor of a few .",
    "the point remains that _ fermi _  lat  might have detected several dark matter subhalos by now , even under the most pessimistic assumptions .",
    "the absence of an overwhelming number of subhalo candidates provides complementary verification of more robust annihilating dark matter limits inferred from dwarf galaxies @xcite and the galactic center @xcite .",
    "we find that the set of variables provided in the _ fermi _  lat  catalogs have the ability to effectively predict gamma - ray source classes in the 3fgl dataset .",
    "after careful examination of various galactic demographics , we find that the 34 additional high - latitude galactic candidates predicted using machine - learning classifiers can be accommodated by existing pulsar population synthesis models without the need to introduce undiscovered globular clusters , dark matter subhalos , or gamma - ray emitting ultra - faint dwarf galaxies . on the other hand , if these objects were produced by annihilating dark matter , the upper limits on the annihilation cross section are starting to approach values at or below the canonical thermal cross section for energies @xmath49 gev",
    ".    the discovery of radio and gamma - ray pulsations will be crucial to address the spectral degeneracy between dark matter annihilation and pulsar emission .",
    "however , blind searches will face greater obstacles in noisy msps and fainter gamma - ray sources as _ fermi _  continues operations .",
    "table 4 shows projected discoveries of msps for 10 years of _ fermi _  lat  data taking .",
    "the most promising follow - up strategy to break these degeneracies will rest on our ability to detect pulsations going from the brightest to the faintest galactic candidates .",
    "some of these searches for the most elusive gamma - ray pulsars are being conducted by the distributed volunteer computing sources , @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "new discoveries will require even larger computing resources and new search strategies .",
    "optical , ultraviolet and x - ray searches for binary objects with temporal variability could also enhance the chances for finding millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "incidentally , the addition of new msps will also bring us closer to the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves based on pulsar - timing arrays @xcite .",
    "should additional high - latitude galactic candidates be confirmed as pulsars , new swaths of annihilation cross sections will be disfavored by direct comparison with statistics from cosmological numerical simulations of milky way - like galaxies .",
    "therefore , subhalo searches represent a powerful complementary method to existing probes of dark matter annihilation .",
    "clearly , there ought to be dedicated multiwavelength campaigns to map the error ellipses of high - latitude galactic candidates for which no radio / gamma - ray pulsations are found .",

    "<S> if these are pulsars , this would bring the total number of msps at @xmath0 to 106 , down to an energy flux @xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 between 100 mev and 100 gev . </S>",
