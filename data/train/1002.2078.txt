    "cylindrical semiconductor nanostructures bridge between quasi-1d systems at small diameters and quasi-2d in the opposite limit , thus extending the wealth of physics and applications of low - dimensional solid - state systems .",
    "the controlled growth of semiconductor quantum tubes ( qts ) with diameters in the 10 - 100 nm range has been recently demonstrated through several techniques , including multi - layer overgrowth of nanowires@xcite and strain - induced bending of a planar heterostructure.@xcite in addition to qts with a solid semiconductor core , it is possible to grow _ hollow _ qts , where the charge carriers are confined in a thin semiconductor shell , encompassed by a barrier material which is only a few nm thick.@xcite large surface - to - volume ratios and the possibility of various functionalizations on both the internal and external surfaces make the latter systems particularly interesting for applications.@xcite    although experiments concerning the optical properties of these systems are still limited , advancements in the optical quality of the samples point to a rapid increase of these investigations.@xcite the excitonic properties of semiconductor qts are particularly interesting with respect to conventional semiconductor quantum wires , where excitons are confined in the core of the nanostructure.@xcite on the one hand , due to the combined effect of the qt curvature and of the quasi-2d confinement of carriers in the cylindrical shell , excitonic binding energies might be substantially stronger than in bulk , even for large diameter qts . on the other hand , a dielectric medium outside the shell of the qt may result in a dielectric confinement of the electric field felt by the optically excited electron - hole pairs , in most cases enhancing their excitonic binding energy . since the dielectric interface is spatially separated from the carriers , which are confined deep inside the shell , excitonic binding and sensitivity to the medium might be strongly enhanced without spoiling the optical properties of the electronic system,@xcite analogously to core - shell nanowires.@xcite the screening provided by the dielectric environment can be varied in a broad range.@xcite the tunability of the dielectric constant in the core of the qt , obtained , _",

    "hereafter we investigate the excitonic binding and oscillator strength in hollow and filled qts for different geometries and dielectric configurations . besides increasing due to the reduced screening ,",
    "the excitonic binding strongly depends on the qt diameter and on the dielectric medium .",

    "we assume that the motion in the radial direction is frozen , and that charge carriers are radially confined in a @xmath0-like well at a distance @xmath1 from the tube axis .",
    "this electronic layer is buried in the middle of a coaxial cylindrical shell of thickness @xmath2 with dielectric constant @xmath3 , while the core and the environmet have in general different dielectric constants , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . since",
    "the shell is a semiconductor material , typically @xmath6.@xcite    the invariance under translations along , and rotations around the tube axis warrants the separation of the center of mass and relative coordinates .",

    "the hamiltonian matrix is block diagonalized using a symmetrized basis set .",
    "in particular , we consider linear combinations of the above basis functions that are even or odd with respect to the inversion of the relative coordinates @xmath62 and @xmath12 , which is the equivalent of inverting the absolute coordinates , since the corresponding inversion operators @xmath63 commute with the relative motion hamiltonian @xmath64 = 0 & , & [ h , \\pi_y ] = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting energy @xmath65 is obtained with respect to the energy minimum of the conduction band . therefore the binding energy of the exciton ground state is @xmath66 . in the presence of a photon gauge field the electron - hole pair recombines emitting a photon of energy @xmath67 .",

    "in the following we investigate the excitonic properties of qts made of the direct gap materials , inas , gaas and inp , and two different dielectric configurations : _ filled _ qts , with a core of the same material of the shell ( @xmath75 ) , and _ hollow _ qts , with the core of the same material as the environment ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we consider qts with diameters in the @xmath77  nm range and a constant shell thickness @xmath78  nm , comparable to state - of - the - art samples.@xcite material parameters used in the calculations are listed in table  [ tab : parameters ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to further investigate the effect of the coulomb interaction between the carriers , we plot the squared modulus of the ground state excitonic wave function for three different dielectric environments , for a inas tube of diameters @xmath79  nm ( fig .  [ fig : wave_20 nm ] ) and @xmath80  nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_100 nm ] ) , for both hollow ( top ) and filled ( bottom ) tubes .",
    "these are two relevant cases , since the former exhibits a geometrical confinement caused by the small circumference , whereas the latter falls fully in the 2d regime without any confinement .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_20 nm ] , the wave function for small tubes is distributed over all the circumference , best visible in the homogeneous case ( @xmath81 ) . reducing the screening by diminishing @xmath5 affects the wavefunctions only weakly , leading to a slightly increased localization , both of the hollow ( upper panels ) as well as of the filled case ( lower panels ) . on the other hand ,",
    "both dielectric configurations lead to similar wavefunctions , reflected in the energies reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : ene_vs_epsilon ] , too .    for large tubes of fig .",
    "[ fig : wave_100 nm ] the wavefunction is no more distributed over all the circumference , but well localized .",
    "therefore the curvature of the tube has no effects on the exciton for larger diameters , making it fully 2d .",
    "again , changing the dielectric configuration , by diminishing @xmath5 as well as by going from hollow ( top panels ) to filled ( bottom panels ) tubes , is changing the wavefunctions only marginally , while the respective energies are very sensitive to it ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ene_vs_epsilon ] ) .",
    "therefore , while the diameter has a definite influence on the dimensionality of the excitonic states , changing the dielectric configuration amounts to modulating the mean screening with nearly no effects on the wavefunction , shifting only the energy .",
    "we have studied theoretically the excitonic properties of semiconductor qts , focusing on the influence of their dielectric environment and its interplay with structural parameters .",
    "we find that , due to the strong increase of the electron - hole interaction and ensuing very large excitonic binding which is possible in these structures , the spectral properties of excitonic absorption are strongly dependent on geometrical parameters and dielectric environment , with energies well below the energies of the dielectrically homogenous case which is always in the 2d regime for typical parameters .",
    "calculations have been performed for inas , gaas and inp .",
    "the low gap material inas shows a peculiar behavior , since in the investigated systems the exciton binding energy is a substantial fraction of the gap .",
    "the very large binding energies , their tunability in a wide range , and the large sensitivity of the excitonic response to the dielectric medium , point to perspective applications of these systems .",
