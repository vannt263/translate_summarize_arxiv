    "the development of new polymeric materials is driven by the increasingly complicated requirements of advanced engineering , as well as by the desire to improve material properties and reduce production cost . beside synthesizing new types of homopolymers and copolymers , blending different polymers",
    "provides another route to obtain new materials @xcite .",
    "polymer blends can have combinative and enhanced properties of their components . from a thermodynamic point of view",
    ", polymer blends may be miscible , partially miscible , or immiscible .",
    "the physical properties of polymer blends vary drastically in these different states . from this perspective ,",
    "a good understanding of the phase behavior of polymer blends is crucial .",
    "because polymer blends are composed of more than one element , their phase behavior is controlled by a large number of parameters , such as chain lengths , monomer interactions and polymer architectures . due to the very large parameter space",
    ", theoretical study is crucially important to understand the phase behavior and material properties in this complex system .",
    "the simplest polymer blend consists of two different homopolymers , a and b. for symmetric binary a / b blends , both homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases exist , depending on the interaction strength @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the flory - huggins interaction parameter and @xmath2 is the degree of polymerization of the polymers @xcite . for small values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the two homopolymers are miscible and the blend is in a homogeneous state . for @xmath0 larger than a critical value ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the two homopolymers become immiscible .",
    "a macrophase separation occurs where the blends separate into a - rich and b - rich phases .",
    "the situation is different when the a and b homopolymers are linked together to form ab diblock copolymers . in this case",
    ", macrophase separation can not take place because of the chemical connections between the a and b blocks .",
    "instead , a microphase separation occurs in which the a and b are separated locally at a length scale determined by the size of the polymers @xcite .",
    "the microphase separation is also controlled by the interaction strength @xmath0 .",
    "for symmetric diblock copolymers , the critical value of @xmath0 for order - disorder transition is about 10.5 .",
    "it is interesting to blend ab diblock copolymers with homopolymers c. in this case the microphase separation of diblock copolymers can compete with the macrophase separation of the homopolymers .",
    "the different interactions between different monomers provide a rich phase behavior .",
    "if the homopolymer c is immiscible with both blocks a and b , the situation is simple : the homopolymers will be separated from diblock copolymers .",
    "a more complex case involves ab / c blends where the homopolymers c are immiscible with one block of the diblock copolymers , but interact favorable with the other block @xcite .",
    "this system is similar to the case of amphiphilic molecules in solution , which is important to understand the self - assembly of surfactants and lipids .",
    "a simple example of this class of blends is that the homopolymers are chemically identical to one of the blocks of the copolymers , i.e. , an ab / a blend .",
    "binary ab / a blends have been extensively studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams of ab / a blends show the coexistence of macrophase separation and microphase separation , and the addition of the homopolymers tends to stabilize some complex ordered structures .",
    "another interesting case occurs for blends consisted of c homopolymers that are miscible with both the a and b blocks .",
    "the miscible nature of the blends may provide potential applications which rely on the homogeneity of the material .",
    "theoretically and practically , the extension to the attractive interactions between compounds may lead to new phenomena and create new materials .",
    "in general , miscible blends are characterized by homogeneous phases .",
    "however , phase separation can be induced by differential monomer - monomer interactions .",
    "an example is found in ternary blends composed of a / b / c homopolymers where all three binary pairs are miscible .",
    "a closed - loop immiscible region is found in the phase diagram @xcite . in cases",
    "that the attractive interaction between a / c is much stronger than that of b / c and a / b , a and c homopolymers tend to be separated from b. on the other hand , macroscopic phase separation of a and b can not take place for ab / c blends , because a and b are chemically bonded together .",
    "similar to the case of diblock copolymers , ab / c blends can reduce their free energy through microphase separation .",
    "indeed , the microphase separation of ab / c blends has been observed in experiment of chen et al .",
    "these authors investigated ab / c blends where the interactions between each pair of segments are favorable .",
    "their experiment revealed a phase diagram with a closed microphase separation loop , despite the fact that the c homopolymers have attractive interactions with both blocks of the copolymers .    in this paper",
    ", we present a theoretic study of the phase behavior of diblock copolymer / homopolymer blends .",
    "the study focuses on the case where the homopolymers attract to one block much strongly than to the other block of the diblock copolymers .",
    "we use the gaussian chain model for the polymers , and apply the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to examine the stability limits of the homogeneous phase , leading to both macrophase and microphase separation transition . while the rpa calculates the stability boundary of the homogeneous phase , we are also interested in the morphological details inside the microphase separation region . for this purpose ,",
    "self - consistent field theory is employed .",

    "here we have neglected terms with order higher than two , and the second - order term can be further written in a quadratic form , where @xmath33 are eigenvalues of matrix @xmath34 .",
    "the stability of the homogeneous phase depends on the sign of eigenvalues @xmath33 . when @xmath35 , the contribution of any fluctuations to the free energy is always positive , so the homogeneous phase is stable . when @xmath36 , the fluctuations reduce the free energy and the homogeneous phase is unstable .    normally , the inverse of the correlation function @xmath34 is a 3@xmath373 matrix for the ab / c blends .",

    "therefore , it is desirable to apply self - consistent field theory to the study of the phase behavior of ab / c blends .    in the framework of self - consistent field theory ,",
    "the system that consists of many interacting diblock copolymer / homopolymer chains is replaced by the problem of an ideal gaussian chain in an averaged effective mean - field potential which depends on the position of the chain .",

    "when the homopolymer concentration is large , the blends exhibit neither the unbinding transition nor the macrophase separation .",
    "this behavior is due to the strong attractive interaction between the a and c monomers . as the homopolymer concentration",
    "is increased close to unity , both cases reach a disordered phase .    when all three binary pairs are miscible , the ab / c blends exhibit another type of phase behavior .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a typical phase diagram for this case with @xmath41 , @xmath59 , @xmath45 and @xmath77 . in this case",

    "ordered phases occur in a closed - loop region , as indicated by the rpa analysis . inside the closed - loop ,",

    "the order - disorder transition is a second - order transition at these two critical points , while the transition is first - order elsewhere .",
    "the nature of the order - disorder transition ( odt ) can be understood by considering the third - order term in the free energy expansion .",
    "a first - order phase transition occurs when a non - zero third - order term is present . in the case of a phase transition from the disordered phase to the bcc phase",
    ", the third - order term does not vanish in general .",
    "therefor a first - order odt is expected . at the critical points",
    ", the odt corresponds to a direct transition from the disordered phase to a lamellar phase . in this case",
    "the symmetry of the lamellar phase ensures the vanishment of the third - order term , resulting in a second - order odt @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out the limitation of the present theory .",
    "the mean - field approach used here approximates the fluctuating potential by a thermal averaged potential .",
    "this assumption becomes inaccurate near the order - disorder transition , where the fluctuations are large .",
    "the fluctuations can shift the position of the phase boundary , and may change the second - order odt into a weakly first - order transition @xcite .    when the homopolymer concentration is increased , the ab / c blends change from a disordered phase to bcc , hex and lam phases .",
    "this sequence of phase transition can be understood by examining how homopolymers are distributed in the diblock melt . since the interaction between a and b are at @xmath59 , which is well below the odt value of 10.5 for symmetric diblocks , the pure diblock copolymers are in a disordered state .",
    "when small amount of homopolymers are added to the system , due to their strong attraction to a - blocks , the homopolymers are distributed around the a - blocks , resulting in an effective segregation of the a - b blocks . ordered phases emerge when this effective segregation becomes strong enough .",
    "another way to picture this effect is to take the homopolymers as the core - forming agents of micelles in a diblock copolymer melt .",
    "the appearance of the spherical phase as the homopolymers are added can be regarded as the ordering of these micelles .",
    "the key observation here is that the reduction of interaction energy from a - c segregation is sufficient to overcome the entropy loss . at the strong - segregation limit ,",
    "a similar mechanism for the formation of reverse structures has been discussed by semenov @xcite .    at higher homopolymer concentration , the volume of a / c domain increases .",
    "the packing requirement of larger a / c domains leads to a change of the interfaces between a / c and b , such that the interfaces are curved more towards the b - domain .",
    "this mechanism lead to order - order phase transitions from bcc to hex , and then from hex to lam phases . after the lam structure , adding more homopolymers induces the phase transition to hex , and then to bcc , where the hex and bcc both have b - blocks as the central components .",
    "eventually , a disordered phase is reached when sufficient amount of homopolymers are added .    in order to explore the effect of the a / c interactions , phase diagrams are constructed for different a / c interactions , either by changing the molecular - weight of c homopolymers or by changing the value of the flory - huggins parameter @xmath12 .",

    "when the interaction parameter @xmath40 becomes attractive , the macrophase separation disappears while the microphase separation can still occur when the magnitude of @xmath40 is large .",

    "another interesting observation of the phase diagram is the reverse morphology where the majority component of the diblock forms the dispersed domains of the ordered structure when small amount of homopolymers are added into the diblock melts .",
