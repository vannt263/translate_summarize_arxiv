    "the spatial distribution and kinematics of the tidal debris of dwarf galaxies or globular clusters is also an important source of information about the gravitational potential of the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in this context , the sagittarius stellar stream ( sgr ) , the most massive stellar stream around the milky way , is a central case study . discovered in 1994 @xcite ,",
    "the tidal tail has been charted across more than one full wrap around the milky way in m - giants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , main sequence stars @xcite , clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars @xcite .",
    "the spatial tightness of the stream in combination with its full @xmath5 span makes it an important probe of the potential , of the disruption process , and of the impact of population gradients and cluster contents of the sgr dwarf on the properties of the tail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the wealth of observational data , models of the stream have failed so far to match all the observational constraints by quite a margin .",
    "to explain the observations different galaxy potentials have been invoked , with arguments for prolate @xcite , spherical @xcite , oblate @xcite or triaxial @xcite dark matter potentials .",
    "to explain some striking features , such as the ` bifurcation ' @xcite , @xcite invoked that the progenitor of the sgr stream may have been a rotating disk galaxy rather than a pressure - supported dwarf galaxy as assumed by most previous models .",
    "however , no single models seems to explain all parts of the stream while it is also not entirely clear that all the overdensities found in the plane of the sgr stream are actually remnants of the same progenitor .",
    "a more precise and more complete empirical picture of the sgr stream could be crucial in clarifying this issue , and this constitutes the central goal of the present paper .    in recent studies of the sgr stream",
    ", there has been increased attention toward bhb stars as a tracer population . due to their relative brightness",
    "they can be observed out to @xmath6 kpc in the stellar halo of the milky way using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data .",
    "however , to take full advantage of area coverage of surveys such as sdss , the identification of these stars needs to be done with photometric data alone .",
    "many publications based their selection on color boxes @xcite that included a significant contamination from other blue stars ( primarily blue straggler ( bs ) stars ) . such contaminants can dominate in number , and are 1 - 2 mag fainter in absolute magnitude , confusing the interpretation of halo structure using such samples .    in this paper , we use sdss data in the north galactic cap to study sgr tidal debris .",
    "we choose color - selected bhb star candidates as sparse tracers of the ancient , metal poor populations with well - defined absolute magnitudes , that are @xmath7 magnitudes brighter than the densely populated main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) stars .",
    "going beyond other recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sgr system in bhb stars we use a refined selection technique based on a spectroscopic training sample which reduces the contamination by other stellar populations ( bell et al .",
    "we show empirically that the distance uncertainties in our sample are small , of the order of 5% .",
    "we use these stars to chart out the sgr stream , focusing on three issues : delineating the distant ( @xmath8 50 kpc ) overdensities that may be associated with the sgr trailing arm , on constraining and measuring the thickness of the leading arm , and on presenting a sample of high - probability sgr bhb star candidates with positions and velocities consistent with sgr membership for further study .",
    "furthermore we are explore the bifurcation that has been found by @xcite perpendicular to the orbital plane of the stream and its appearance in bhb stars .",
    "for this study , we use data release 7 @xcite of the sdss to probe the sagittarius stellar stream with bhb stars .",
    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that has so far mapped a little over @xmath9 of the sky .",
    "imaging data are produced simultaneously in five photometric bands , namely , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the data are processed through pipelines to measure photometric and astrometric properties @xcite and to select targets for spectroscopic follow - up @xcite .",
    "the horizontal branch is populated by stars which have developed past the main sequence stage and are now burning helium in their cores and hydrogen in the shell .",
    "bhb stars have the dual advantages of a high luminosity ( allowing probing of the milky way halo to @xmath8 100kpc ) , and have a small intrinsic spread in absolute magnitudes .",
    "their main disadvantage is that the selection of a clean sample of bhb stars is challenging from photometry alone .",
    "while broad cuts in @xmath15 and @xmath16 are sufficient to isolate bhb stars and other a - type stars ( expected to be bs stars ; @xcite , @xcite ) from low - redshift quasars and white dwarfs , distinguishing bhb stars from the bs contaminants is considerably more challenging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous works have used broad color cuts designed to mitigate this contamination ( @xcite and @xcite used the selection in figure 10 of @xcite ; @xcite used a different cut for their faint sample of bhb candidates ) . yet",
    ", these methods all suffer from very substantial contamination from bs stars .",
    "spectroscopy permits a fairly clean separation of bhb stars from bs stars on the basis of surface gravity dependent balmer line profiles .",
    "@xcite , following @xcite , use a two - stage cut to distinguish bhb from bs stars .",
    "first , stars in the color box @xmath17 and @xmath18 with a relatively low line width and low flux in the line core relative to the continuum are chosen ( this reduces contamination to @xmath19% ) .",
    "then , a srsic profile is fitted to the balmer lines . by combination of these two criteria ,",
    "a @xmath20% pure sample of bhb stars is isolated .",
    "unfortunately , sdss spectroscopy of bhb stars ( mostly from segue ) is limited to certain areas of sky , and only relatively bright bhb stars are targeted , meaning that bhb stars more distant than @xmath21kpc are not well - probed by the sdss .    therefore , we have re - addressed the issue of photometric selection of bhb star candidates ( described in full in bell et al .",
    "we use the spectroscopic classifications of @xmath22 stars from @xcite as a training set .",
    "we calculate the probability of a star in the color box @xmath17 and @xmath18 being a bhb star from this training set ( figure [ fig : selection ] ) .",
    "blue data points show stars that are very likely to be bhb stars on the basis of their spectra ( a contamination of much less than 10% has been argued by @xcite and @xcite for @xmath23 ) .",
    "the thick contour outlines the region of color - color space where the fraction of bhb candidates that are spectroscopically - classified bhb stars is @xmath24% and there were more than 16 stars in a bin of 0.025@xmath250.04 mag . applying this selection to the sdss dr7 @xcite",
    ", we obtain a candidate sample with 389,785 stars within the @xmath17 , @xmath18 color box . in the following",
    "we apply a lower probability limit of 50% for the photometric sample reducing the sample size to 28,270 stars .",
    "tests show that this ` @xmath26 ' probability sample isolates half of the @xmath27 bhb star population , with a contamination of @xmath28% .",
    "performance at fainter limits is expected to degrade gradually , with increasing incompleteness and contamination ( at @xmath29 roughly 1/4 of bhb stars are expected to be kept , and contamination may be as severe as 50% ; bell et al . 2010 ) .",
    "we will later test the influence of changing the probability cuts ( and therefore completeness / contamination ) in section [ probmap ] .",
    "the radial velocity sample , which is a sub - sample of the photometric sample , was selected based on the spectra as described above offering a much higher bhb purity @xmath30% than the method applied on the stars with photometry only . to not unnecessarily restrict the sample size",
    ", we use the full radial velocity sample in these cases and ignore for these stars the probabilities which were assigned based on their colors ( i.e. , we do not use the lower probability limit of 50% mentioned above ) .",
    "the total sample size is 5233 stars , of which 807 are located in the sgr plane ( see section [ planesection ] ) . from these 807 stars 616 would fulfill the 50% probability criterion , giving a success rate of spectroscopic bhb stars in this selection of 76% . throughout this paper",
    "the radial velocities are given in the galactic standard of rest , which are the heliocentric radial velocities corrected for the galactic rotation assuming a rotation velocity of 220kms@xmath4 for the local standard of rest and ( + 10.0,+5.2,+7.2)kms@xmath4 for the solar motion where the directions are defined as pointing towards the galactic center , in the direction of rotation and towards the north galactic pole ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "for much of our analysis , we focus on stars in the presumed orbital plane of the sgr stream only .",
    "we define this ` sagittarius plane ' to encompass the sgr stream and the galactic center ; this is presumably close to the orbital plane of the sgr stream .",
    "to ensure consistency with models , we use the same pole as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath31 .",
    "stars are considered to be in the plane if they lie within @xmath32 of this plane ; this definition naturally yields not a plane but a wedge , whose physical thickness increases with distance from the sun .",
    "stars are projected onto this plane by conserving the distance to the sun ( i.e. , the plane is a projection of shell segments onto the plane ) .",
    "the sagittarius plane defined here includes 73,066 stars ( 6905 with a bhb star probability greater than 50% ) from the total 389,785 stars ( 28,270 with a bhb star probability greater than 50% ) in the sdss volume that are inside the color box .",
    "-color selected bhb star candidates with @xmath33 50% bhb probability ; the rest of the sample with lower probabilities is shown as crosses .",
    "it can be clearly seen that there is a trend towards fainter magnitudes for bluer colors ; the @xmath16 dependent @xmath34 calibration of @xcite follows this trend closely .",

    "a number of previous works have explored the properties of the sgr tidal debris using different stellar tracers , such as main - sequence turnoff stars , m giants , subgiant stars , or bhb stars . in this paper , we have presented a discussion of the structure and properties of the sagittarius stellar stream using candidate bhb stars selected from the sdss coverage of the north galactic cap .",
    "bhb stars are in many senses an excellent tracer of tidal structure : they are luminous and can be traced to @xmath35kpc distances from the sun with current surveys ; they are good standard candles with @xmath36% accurate distances ; and although they are rather sparse compared to other stellar populations , they are still quite numerous in the sgr tidal stream ( with exception of the closest part of the leading arm as shown in figure [ msto ] ) .",
    "recently , there have been a number of sgr stellar stream studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also based on various stellar populations , some including bhb stars in sdss .",
    "in contrast to those studies , we entirely focus on bhb stars for the analysis , using other data only to relate our distance scale to other distance indicators .",
    "we attempt to use as pure a sample of bhb star candidates as is possible for our analysis , minimizing to the greatest extent possible the high levels of contamination seen in earlier studies . for charting out the global structure of the sgr tidal stream we make use of a method that selects bhb stars from sdss imaging data using a spectroscopic training set to isolate areas of @xmath37 color space that give a sample that should consist of @xmath38% bhb stars .",
    "this method does not just make binary acceptance or rejection decisions based on the position in color - space , but assign probabilities to the stars based on their position in color space . in our analysis we mostly reject stars with probabilities @xmath39 and make use of the probability information for the remaining sample by weighting the individual stars by their probabilities .",
    "we evaluate the precision of our distance determination through comparison with distance measurements of known clusters and dwarf spheroidals .",
    "we see an offset in the mean values of @xmath40% for the literature values , and a distance variance of @xmath36% .",
    "comparison to the m giants in the sgr orbital plane implies that the m giant distances should be revised upward by 8% or 12% when compared with our bhb scale or the cluster distance scale in the literature , respectively .",
    "the offset to the previously adopted m giant distance scale is expected to propagate through to the models built to match the m giant observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when studying the kinematics of the sgr tidal tail , we focus on a sample of stars with sdss dr7 spectroscopy classified as bhb stars using the method of @xcite and @xcite ; this sample should be @xmath20% bhb stars .    with these samples , we focus on four sgr stream issues that are not well - explored in the literature : a possible extension of the trailing sgr debris stream , the line - of - sight thickness of the leading tail , the bifurcation of the leading arm and the heliocentric distances of the two branches in bhb stars and the isolation of a small sample of high - probability sgr member stars .    using the photometric sample with a @xmath26 bhb probability limitation",
    ", we identify a possible extension to the trailing tail of the sgr debris stream to @xmath41 kpc .",
    "the densest part of this feature , which coincides spatially with the globular cluster ngc 2419 , was previously argued to be associated with the sgr trailing arm by @xcite .",
    "our bhb star maps confirm a weak overdensity which may be the extension of this arm back towards the milky way , which was also seen by @xcite .",
    "we estimate the significance of this feature to be around 3.8 @xmath2 as compared to random selections of the same area within a region spanning the angular range and distance of the proposed trailing arm .",
    "a concentration in this region , which is claimed to be associated with the trailing arm of sgr was also found by @xcite in 2mass m giants through a group finding technique .",
    "such a feature is expected qualitatively by models of sgr disruption .",
    "quantitatively , all models predict that this ` returning ' segment of the trailing arm should be closer to the sun along these lines of sight .",
    "yet , bhb stars are _ not _ observed at these predicted distances , and this tension would be resolved if one instead interpreted this distant overdensity as this predicted part of the trailing sgr arm and acknowledges a discrepancy between the positions predicted by the models and the observed location . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that recently @xcite reported an overdensity in red clump stars consistent with the predicted trailing arm location in the prolate models in a range of @xmath42 .",
    "owing to confusion between sgr and virgo overdensity debris at the distance ranges probed by @xcite , we were unable to confirm or refute this feature . if their feature is indeed correctly interpreted as trailing arm debris , we would suggest the feature identified here may be another , more distant wrap of trailing arm debris from an earlier close passage of sgr .",
    "we use the @xmath26 probability sample to characterize the leading arm of the sgr stellar stream more closely by measuring the line - of - sight thickness and selecting a high - probability sample of member stars .",
    "we find a mean thickness of @xmath43  kpc , after accounting for distance uncertainties in the bhb stars , comparable to the projected width of sgr on the sky .",
    "these measurements are in a similar range as those given by @xcite in red clump stars ( their table 2 ) , when the assumed overestimation by a factor of @xmath44 which is introduced by their measurement method is taken into account . inspired by the clear appearance of the leading arm in position ( and velocity ) , we use this measurement of the line - of - sight thickness to select a sample of highly likely stream stars from the spectroscopic sdss sample .",
    "we choose stars within 2@xmath2 of the stream in line - of - sight distance .",
    "this subsample of stars shows a clear overdensity in velocity space , which matches model predictions reasonably well .",
    "this strengthens the results of @xcite who showed that bhb star candidates in the area selected to represent the spatial position of the leading arm in k / m - giants were overdense in velocity space .",
    "they find a similar trend in velocity space , but with far more outliers , probably due to the higher level of contamination in the bhb star sample and the broader selection box for the leading arm . from our spatially selected sample ,",
    "we measure an average velocity dispersion of sgr stars of 37kms@xmath4 .",
    "we further select stars within 1@xmath2 of this velocity overdensity to be in our clean sample of @xmath38 sgr bhb stars ; such a sample suffers from the inhomogeneous angle coverage and distance limitations inherent to spectroscopically - selected sdss bhb stars , but has the advantage of high fidelity .",
    "using the spatially selected sgr bhb star sample we examine the observed bifurcation of the sgr stream on the sky and its implications for the distances of the two branches .",
    "different distances of the two branches of the stream have been reported by e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and are also predicted by models @xcite .",
    "this bifurcation is of particular interest for the understanding of the formation history of the sgr stream .",
    "it has been a challenge for models to reproduce and explain the origin of this feature .",
    "it was proposed to have originated from wraps of different age @xcite , but also intrinsic properties of the progenitor were offered as explanations .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a model in which this bifurcation is reproduced when a rotating disk galaxy is assumed as the progenitor .",
    "there is no indication of a spatial bifurcation on the sky in our bhb star sample therefore we use msto stars to define the two branches on the sky .",
    "we measure the mean and width of the two parts along the leading arm and find only a small 1 - 2 kpc offset between the two branches over a wide orbital angle range and no clear systematic separation in the sense that one is always clearly closer in than the other ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported a trend by visual impression that the branch at higher galactic latitude tends to be at closer distances than the branch at lower galactic latitude .",
    "@xcite found similar to slightly higher offsets between the distances of the two branches compared to this study , but here again no clear trend is seen for one branch being always at closer distances than the other .",
    "although the actual values for mean distances of the two branches in our data set seem to be quite sensitive to the precise location of the separation cut on the sky , we clearly do not see a separation on the level shown in @xcite for the same range of positions along the stream or predicted by the models @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that this distance separation appears here to be much smaller than the separation of the two branches on the sky which is at a @xmath45 level .",
    "this strong discrepancy between the small line - of - sight separation and the much larger separation perpendicular to that might be challenging to reproduce in the models .",
