    "<S> properties of proton resonances in @xmath0ne have been investigated efficiently by utilizing a technique of proton resonant elastic scattering with a @xmath1f radioactive ion ( ri ) beam and a thick proton target . </S>",
    "<S> a 4.22  mev / nucleon @xmath1f ri beam was produced via a projectile - fragmentation reaction , and subsequently separated by a radioactive ion beam line in lanzhou ( ribll ) . </S>",
    "<S> energy spectra of the recoiled protons were measured by two sets of @xmath2e - e silicon telescope at center - of - mass scattering angles of @xmath3@xmath4175@xmath5@xmath65@xmath5 , @xmath3@xmath4152@xmath5@xmath68@xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> several proton resonances in @xmath0ne were observed , and their resonant parameters have been determined by an @xmath7-matrix analysis of the differential cross sections in combination with the previous results . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant parameters are related to the reaction - rate calculation of the stellar @xmath8o(@xmath9,@xmath10)@xmath1f reaction , which was thought to be the breakout reaction from the hot cno cycles into the @xmath11-process in x - ray bursters . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12=(3@xmath13 , 2@xmath13 ) are tentatively assigned to the 6.15-mev state which was thought the key 1@xmath13 state previously . in addition , a doublet structure at 7.05 mev are tentatively identified , and its contribution to the resonant reaction rate of @xmath8o(@xmath9,@xmath10)@xmath1f could be enhanced by at least factors of about 4@xmath146 in comparison with the previous estimation involving only a singlet . </S>",
    "<S> the present calculated resonant rates are much larger than those previous values , and it may imply that this breakout reaction could play a crucial role under x - ray bursters conditions . </S>"
