    "at high energies , the cross - sections of all _ hadronic objects _ ( protons , nuclei , or even photons `` fluctuating '' into @xmath6 vector states ) are dominated by scatterings involving gluons .",
    "gluons clearly outnumber quarks in the small momentum fraction ( low-@xmath0 ) range of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) as a consequence of the qcd parton splitting probabilities described by the dglap  @xcite and bfkl  @xcite evolution equations .",
    "the fast growth of the gluon densities @xmath7 for decreasing @xmath0 conspicuously observed in dis @xmath8 at hera  @xcite , can not however continue indefinitely since this would violate unitarity even for scatterings with @xmath9 . for small enough @xmath0 values",
    ", gluons must start to recombine in a process known as gluon saturation  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when the size occupied by the partons becomes similar to the size of the hadron @xmath10 , or in terms of the _ saturation momentum _ @xmath11",
    "when : @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath11 grows with the number @xmath13 of nucleons in the `` target '' , the collision energy @xmath4 , and the rapidity of the gluon @xmath14 , according to : @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath13 dependence implies that , at equal energies , saturation effects will be enhanced by factors as large as @xmath16 6 in a heavy nucleus ( @xmath13 = 208 for pb ) compared to protons .",
    "theoretically , the regime of low-@xmath0 qcd can be effectively described in the `` color glass condensate '' ( cgc ) framework , where all gluon fusions and multiple scatterings are `` resummed '' into classical high - density gluon wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding evolution is given in this case by the bk / jimwlk  @xcite _ non - linear _ equations .",
    "+ experimentally , the most direct way to access the low-@xmath0 pdfs in hadronic collisions is by measuring perturbative probes ( heavy-@xmath17 , jets , high-@xmath18 hadrons , prompt @xmath19 , ... ) at large @xmath4 and _ forward _ rapidities  @xcite . for a @xmath20 parton scattering ,",
    "the _ minimum _ @xmath0 probed in a process with a particle of momentum @xmath18 produced at pseudo - rapidity @xmath21 , is @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "thus , @xmath24 decreases by a factor of @xmath2510 every 2 units of rapidity .",
    "the experimental capabilities of the cms experiment are extremely well adapted for the study of low-@xmath0 phenomena with proton and ion beams .",
    "the acceptance of the cms / totem system is the largest ever available in a collider , and the detector is designed to measure different particles with excellent momentum resolution  @xcite : jets @xmath26 , @xmath19 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 3 ) , muons ( @xmath28 2.5 ) , hadrons ( @xmath28 6.6 ) , plus neutrals in the zero - degree calorimeters ( zdcs , @xmath29 8.3 ) .",
    "we present a selection of four observables measurable in cms which are sensitive to parton saturation effects in the proton and nucleus wave - functions at lhc energies .",
    "other relevant measurements ( e.g. forward drell - yan in p - p at 14 tev ) are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , the _ hadron _ rapidity density @xmath31 is directly related to the number of initially released _ partons _ at a given @xmath21 .",
    "cgc approaches which effectively take into account a reduced initial parton flux in the nuclear pdfs , reproduce successfully the absolute hadron yields ( as well as their centrality and @xmath1 dependences ) at sps  rhic energies  @xcite . at lhc ,",
