    "a `` hidden '' sector of light particles , none of which carry standard model quantum numbers , is still allowed by experiment .",
    "neither direct searches , nor indirect tests of the standard model , nor cosmology or astrophysics can exclude this possibility . if the coupling of such a sector to our own is purely through gravitation , constraints are extremely weak .",
    "but if additional interactions , with characteristic energy scales far below the planck scale , are present , then it is possible to obtain some correlated constraints on the strength of those interactions and the contents of the hidden sector .    since the contents of such a sector are all neutral and may all be stable or metastable , production of anything in that sector may generally be invisible .",
    "in such a case , constraints may be obtained at a wide range of particle colliders , using their searches for unexplained sources of missing momentum . at a hadron collider ,",
    "the typical search is for a jet or a photon plus missing transverse momentum . at an electron - positron collider",
    ", a powerful constraint may be obtained from searches for `` photon - plus - nothing ''  events in which a photon is observed whose momentum is not balanced against any visible object . since the collision energy and momentum are known at a lepton collider , the four - momentum of the missing object , and its square , the `` missing mass , '' may be reconstructed .",
    "the events are very clean and easy to interpret , though a background from @xmath3 , where the neutrinos may or may not originate from an on - shell @xmath4 , must be removed .    in this article",
    ", we consider constraints on hidden sectors from photon - plus - nothing searches at the large electron - positron ( lep ) collider in its two stages , lep i ( at the @xmath5 boson peak ) and lep ii ( at center - of - mass energies up to 209 gev ) .",
    "our focus here will be on exactly or approximately conformal hidden sectors , now often called `` unparticle '' sectors @xcite .",
    "we will obtain constraints on couplings of @xmath6 gauge bosons to low - dimension scalar operators in such sectors .",
    "we only consider operators with dimension less than 2 .",
    "( for @xmath7 , operator renormalizations become necessary and the calculations become sensitive to the ultraviolet , leaving them less predictive .",
    "note also that unitarity requires @xmath8 . )    as an application of our results , we will combine them with the work of @xcite and @xcite to obtain limits on the process @xmath9 , highlighted in @xcite as a possible source of a large effect of an unparticle sector .",
    "we will see that where qualitatively new constraints can be obtained , the allowed signals must lie below 5 fb , even at a 14 tev collider .    in section 2",
    ", we will discuss the general theoretical background and calculations needed for this paper . in section 3 , we will obtain bounds from lep results . finally , we will apply these bounds in the particular case of four - photon production at the lhc .",
    "in what follows , we imagine that , through new physics somewhat above the tev scale , a hidden conformal ( unparticle ) sector is coupled to the standard model gauge bosons .",
    "( couplings to fermions risk flavor - changing neutral currents , unless they occur through conserved currents of dimension 3 , in which case contact terms generally dominate @xcite . )",
    "we assume the following lagrangian , where a scalar primary operator @xmath0 of the conformal sector couples to the electroweak gauge fields .",
    "@xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real and positive .",
    "the two conformal operators in this expression are assumed to be the same , with scaling dimension @xmath14 ; we consider only @xmath15 . as is the standard operating procedure in the literature on scalar unparticle sectors , we ignore serious subtleties involving the generation of the operator @xmath16 through quantum effects , assuming that ( as for the higgs mass operator ) the coefficient of the operator is suppressed through an unspecified mechanism .",
    "examples of possible mechanisms include supersymmetry ; see for example @xcite .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking mixes the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 to form the photon and the @xmath4 , the lagrangian contains the terms    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the following definitions will simplify formulae @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 real and positive .",
    "for the present article the most interesting interactions will be those involving the photon .",
    "the photon  photon ",
    "unparticle vertex , and the photon@xmath4unparticle vertex , lead to vertices with feynman rules @xcite @xmath26    in sec .",
    "[ sec : fourphotons ] , we will assume that the gluons couple to the unparticle sector as well . we will rename @xmath0 and @xmath14 as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and permit the gluons to couple to an operator @xmath29 @xmath30 here , @xmath29 ( and @xmath31 ) may or may not be the same as @xmath27 ( and @xmath28 ) .",
    "( note that @xcite , in considering four photon production at the tevatron and lhc , assumed @xmath32 . )",
    "this lagrangian yields the vertex @xmath33",
    "the amplitude for @xmath34 at tree level ( figure [ feyndiag ] ) is @xmath35 where @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the relative phase difference between the two diagrams in [ photonmediated ] and [ zmediated ] , originally parametrized by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the result for @xmath40 matches @xcite appropriately in the @xmath41 limit .",
    "the differential cross section is calculated with respect to the mandelstam variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as well as with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with @xmath45 the energy of the final state photon . @xmath46",
    "the latter result is most suitable for numerical integration to compare to experiments with lepton colliders .    at the peak of the @xmath4 resonance , @xmath47 , for @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "this ratio becomes the smallest for @xmath50 , where latexmath:[$|a_z| \\sim 35    resonance , we mainly obtain a bound of @xmath25 alone . at lep ii energies , near 200 gev , @xmath52 for @xmath48 , up to a maximum of @xmath53 for @xmath49 , and thus we obtain a limit mainly on @xmath24 .",
    "during the first run of the lep experiment , data was collected at the z - resonance .",
    "unparticle production is therefore dominated by the @xmath54 term ( see eq .  [ alambda ] ) , as was argued in the previous paragraph . to obtain a worst case bound on @xmath25",
    ", we will neglect contributions from the photon channel . is such that interference is maximally destructive , including",
    "the photon channel can decrease the signal by up to @xmath55 .",
    "but this is less than other systematic errors discussed in [ sectionerror ] , so we neglect it . ]",
    "this bound could be only slightly improved by incorporating the data from lep ii .    as can be seen from the energy distribution of the single photon in formula [ photoncrosssection ] ,",
    "unparticles tend to produce very hard photons for values of @xmath14 less than two .",
    "the standard model background for this signal on the other hand is only of order 0.5 - 1 events . to obtain optimal sensitivity for our bounds",
    "we require the photon energy to be larger than a certain minimum energy , @xmath56 , which is determined by optimizing the sensitivity for the bound on @xmath25 .",
    "more details on the energy cuts can be found in appendix [ analysisappendix ] .",
    "none of the four lep i detectors observed events that pass our energy cuts @xcite .    combining ( as described in the appendix ) the available data from all four experiments we establish a 95% confidence level ( cl ) bound on @xmath25 , following @xcite .",
    "our bounds are displayed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "a plot of the allowed regions for @xmath13 and @xmath12 , the couplings to the @xmath57 bosons , is also given in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "for this plot , the entire matrix element was taken into account .    the value we give for @xmath25 when @xmath58 is consistent with the known branching fraction for @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a very light new invisible particle and @xmath61 gev . the partial width for",
    "this process would be @xmath62 since no 45 gev photons plus missing energy were observed in any of the four lep experiments , one can obtain a model - independent @xmath63 cl bound on the branching ratio .",
    "the best such published bound , @xmath64 , was obtained by the l3 experiment @xcite , and this can be converted to @xmath65 tev with @xmath63 cl .",
    "the bound in our table above is consistent with this , though somewhat stronger since we combine all four lep i experiments in our calculation .",
    "the second run of lep scanned center of mass energies from 130 gev to 209 gev .",
    "since the cross section [ photoncrosssection ] grows with @xmath66 , the highest collider energies will give us the best bounds .",
    "the dominant mode of unparticle production at these energies is via the photon channel , and interference effects are small , so we obtain a worst case bound on @xmath24 by neglecting contribution from the @xmath5 channel .    as mentioned above , the best bounds on @xmath24",
    "can be obtained from the highest energies at lep ii .",
    "our bounds below therefore take account only of data from energy in the range 183 - 209 gev .",
    "in particular , delphi @xcite , aleph @xcite , and l3 @xcite published results for @xmath66 between 183 gev and 209 gev , while opal @xcite did not publish a result above 189 gev . if one accounted for the results at lower collider energies , it would be possible to extract a bound that is slightly better than ours .",
    "since the collider energy was changed over time , the data in @xcite are given not in terms of the photon energy itself but in terms of the `` missing mass '' , the mass that an invisible particle would have had if it were recoiling from the observed photon .",
    "for low @xmath14 , the signal is peaked in the low missing mass region,=1 corresponds to a massless invisible scalar particle . ] while for higher @xmath14 , the signal is rather flat . since the standard model background is smallest in the low missing - mass region , far from the @xmath67 peak , integrating the signal from zero missing mass up to some maximum missing - mass @xmath68 yields the best bounds .",
    "the selection of @xmath68 for each @xmath14 , and other details of our analysis , are described in appendix [ analysisappendix ] .",
    "opal , aleph and in particular delphi detected several events that pass our energy cuts .",
    "the bounds we obtain are found in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the allowed regions for @xmath13 and @xmath12 ( the couplings to the @xmath6 bosons ) are given in figure [ fig2 ] ; here the entire matrix element including the @xmath5 contribution is taken into account .",
    "finally , we wish to note that there are ambiguities regarding the interpretation of certain published plots which affect the analyses , and require us to make certain assumptions . a key ambiguity regarding our analysis revolves around the result of the delphi experiment .",
    "( at delphi , as with the other experiments , we only use data from approximately 45 to 135 degrees ; see appendix [ analysisappendix ] . ) in the bin at zero missing mass , there are 7 events , above one expected in background .",
    "this bin was used as an underflow , and at least 6 of the events are from `` photons '' with energy larger than half the beam energy , giving a negative apparent missing mass , which is not consistent with our signal .",
    "we therefore view the interpretation of one unexplained event in this bin as ambiguous .",
    "there are several choices , including discarding this bin as having large background , discarding the 7th event in the bin as being more plausibly background than signal , discarding the delphi data completely , etc .",
    "our table above reflects the most liberal ( but in our view , also the most plausible ) assumption that the seventh event in the zero - missing - mass bin is , like the other six , from a background source .",
    "it is likely that this could be shown to be the case with sufficient information about the delphi data .",
    "if instead we treat the seventh event as a potential signal , the effect on our bounds is substantial in the regime where @xmath14 is small , on the order of 20% in @xmath24 .",
    ".95 @xmath69 confidence level lower bounds on the given scales , in tev , from lep data . for bounds on @xmath70 and @xmath71 , see the figures in appendix a.[table1 ] [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "at both lep i and lep ii , the highest signal - to - background ratio is found for large photon energies .",
    "the only significant source of standard model background in this regime is @xmath72 production , which falls quickly with rising photon energy @xcite . as mentioned before ,",
    "the unparticle signal is peaked at higher photon energy .",
    "optimal values for the photon energy cut were found using the following method .",
    "for any potential value of the cut energy @xmath73 , the bound on @xmath25 or @xmath24 was calculated for any number @xmath74 of observed photon events with energy above the cut .",
    "these bounds were then averaged over @xmath74 , using a poisson distribution for @xmath74 assuming the only source is the background .",
    "the value of @xmath73 that produces the strongest average expected bound on @xmath25 or @xmath24 via this method is then used as the energy cut , following @xcite .",
    "for lep i , we can reproduce reasonably well the shape of each experiment s monte carlo simulation of background with the background model @xcite .",
    "we fit the normalization to account for each experiment s efficiency .",
    "an additional complication was that l3 had a larger angular acceptance than opal , delphi and aleph .",
    "for the purpose of being conservative , we only considered the signal in the wedge that all four detectors have in common , but took into account the background for the entire l3 detector .",
    "the cut energies for different values of @xmath14 were calculated to the nearest 0.2 gev , maximizing the expected bound on @xmath25 , and can be found in table [ lep1cuts ] .",
    "the signal efficiencies for these cuts range from 0.98 for @xmath14 close to 1 to 0.74 for @xmath14 close to 2 .    in the case of lep ii ,",
    "the background model is less clear - cut .",
    "the background in l3 and aleph is very small , and the resolution of the plots is insufficient to make a reliable estimate .",
    "we therefore chose to omit any background from l3 and opal in our analysis .",
    "for opal and especially delphi , the background is more significant .",
    "however , because of the rather low resolution of delphis inner detector wedge ( hpc ) , we can not reproduce the shape of delphis monte carlo with the background model of @xcite .",
    "instead we used a more general fit function with three fit parameters to model the background in opal and delphi .",
    "furthermore , delphi is the only experiment that has separate plots available for the different segments of its detector .",
    "since the signal is rather flat in @xmath75 and the background is peaked in the forward region , we only consider delphis inner wedge to increase the signal to background ratio . as",
    "delphis resolution is inferior compared to the other three experiments , it has some background events leaking into the signal region , resulting from the smearing of the z - peak .",
    "these events significantly weaken our bound for values of @xmath14 close to 2 .    to calculate the cuts ,",
    "the same analysis was performed as was done for lep i , but now in terms of missing mass .",
    "the cut on the missing mass was calculated to the nearest 1.0 gev , maximizing the expected bound on @xmath24 , and can be found in table [ lep1cuts ] .        to determine the bounds at 95@xmath69 confidence level , the following equation was used , from @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the expected number of background events",
    ", @xmath79 is the number of observed events , and @xmath80 is the 95@xmath69 cl upper limit on the expected number of signal events .",
    "note that if @xmath81 , corresponding to no observed events , then @xmath82 independent of the number of expected background events .    at lep",
    "i , none of the experiments observed any events with energies above the cuts .",
    "the bound was imposed by integrating the cross section [ photoncrosssection ] above the appropriate energy cut , within the angular wedge that all four detectors shared ( @xmath83 ) , and accounting for the various detector efficencies and luminosities .",
    "the calculation was performed at each value of @xmath66 used by the experiments , and summed over all values , accounting for the various efficencies and luminosities .    at lep ii",
    ", some events were observed that passed the missing mass cuts .",
    "the events were counted by hand from the graphs in @xcite . as in lep",
    "i , the integrated cross section was bounded to the appropriate value computed from equation [ boundstat ] . again",
    ", the calculation was performed at each value of @xmath66 used by the experiments , and summed over all values , accounting for the various efficencies and luminosities . when computing the expected signal , we have been conservative by only accounting for angular acceptance that all detectors have in common with delphis inner wedge ( @xmath84 ) .",
