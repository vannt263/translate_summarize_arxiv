    "in this paper , the output feedback tracking problem for a class of systems with measurable nonlinearities and unknown disturbances is considered .",
    "this problem has attracted great research interest in recent years @xcite-@xcite . as far as nonlinear systems are concerned ,",
    "several results are available under the minimum phase assumption . in @xcite ,",
    "global disturbance rejection with stabilization for nonlinear systems in output feedback form was solved in spite of the disturbance generated by a finite dimensional exosystem .",
    "the similar problem but subject to unknown parameters on both input matrix and system matrix was considered in @xcite . in @xcite , another control algorithm in simplicity of implementation",
    "was proposed for nonlinear plants with parametric and functional uncertainty in the presence of biased harmonic disturbance .",
    "the problem about nonminimum phase nonlinear systems was further considered . in @xcite-@xcite , adaptive estimation of unknown disturbances in a class of nonminimum phase nonlinear systems , and the stabilization and disturbance rejection based on the estimated disturbances for single - input single - output ( siso )",
    "systems were solved .",
    "the result was further extended to a class of nonminimum phase nonlinear multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems in @xcite . in @xcite , a solution to this problem was provided for nonminimum phase systems with uncertainties in both parameters and order of an exosystem .",
    "the basic idea of the current work is to decompose the output feedback tracking task  into simpler subtasks .",
    "then one can design a controller for each subtask respectively , which are finally integrated together to achieve the original control task .",
    "the motivation of this paper can be described as follows .",
    "first , it is to avoid conflict among tracking performance , rejection performance and robustness .",
    "it is well known that there is an intrinsic conflict between performance ( trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection ) and robustness in the standard feedback framework @xcite,@xcite . by the control scheme mentioned in @xcite-@xcite , as the dimension of the exosystem is increasing",
    ", the closed - loop system will be incorporated into a copy of marginally stable exosystem according to internal model principle @xcite to achieve high performance ( trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection ) .",
    "the price to be paid is a reduced robustness against uncertainties , especially for nonminimum phase systems .",
    "moreover , conflict between tracking performance and rejection performance exists as well when reference and disturbance behave differently @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is to relax the restriction on the disturbance . for the control scheme mentioned in @xcite-@xcite , a regulator equation",
    "often needs to be solved first for a coordinate transformation , which yields an error system with disturbances appearing at the input .",
    "however , these control schemes are only applicable to finite - dimensional autonomous exosystems . while , the control scheme mentioned in @xcite requires the system being minimum phase to shift disturbances to the input channel .",
    "for such a purpose , a new control scheme based on the _ _ additive state decomposition _",
    "_ , called _ additive - state - decomposition - based tracking control _ , is proposed which is applicable to both minimum phase and nonminimum phase systems .",
    "the proposed additive state decomposition is a new decomposition manner different from the lower - order subsystem decomposition methods existing in the literature , see e.g. @xcite,@xcite .",
    "concretely , taking the system @xmath0 for example , it is decomposed into two subsystems : @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3and@xmath4 respectively .",
    "the lower - order subsystem decomposition satisfies@xmath5 by contrast , the proposed additive state decomposition satisfies@xmath6 in our opinion , lower - order subsystem decomposition aims to reduce the complexity of the system itself , while the additive state decomposition emphasizes the reduction of the complexity of tasks for the system .    by following the philosophy above , in the additive - state - decomposition - based tracking _ _  _ _ control scheme , the output feedback tracking is ` additively ' decomposed into three independent subtasks , namely the tracking subtask , the rejection subtask and the stabilization subtask .",
    "three subcontrollers for the three subtasks are designed separately then .",
    "since the resulting controller possesses three degrees of freedom , the proposed scheme in fact gives a potential way to avoid conflict among tracking performance , rejection performance and robustness .",
    "moreover , by the additive - state - decomposition - based tracking _ _  _ _ control scheme , it will be seen that both the tracking subtask and rejection subtask only need to be achieved on a linear time invariant ( lti ) system .",
    "consequently , the tracking controller and disturbance compensator can be designed in both time domain and frequency domain . in this framework",
    ", the existing output regulation methods as in @xcite-@xcite can be incorporated .",
    "also , it can take advantage of some standard design methods in frequency domain to handle general disturbances .",
    "more importantly , nonminimum phase systems can be handled in the same framework .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the problem formulation is given and the additive state decomposition is recalled briefly first . in section 3 ,",
    "the considered system is transformed to a disturbance - free system in sense of input - output equivalence .",
    "sequently , in section 4 , the transformed system is ` additively ' decomposed into three subsystems . in section 5",
    ", controller design is given .",
    "section 6 concludes this paper .",
    "consider a class of siso nonlinear systems similar to @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite:@xmath7 where @xmath8is a constant matrix , @xmath9and @xmath10are constant vectors , @xmath11 is a nonlinear function vector , @xmath12 is the state vector , @xmath13 is the output , @xmath14 is the control , and @xmath15 is a bounded disturbance .",

    "additive state decomposition @xcite is recalled here briefly .",

    "an extended state observer including states of the considered nonlinear system and the exosystem is designed , where the disturbance is assumed to be generated by a finite - dimensional autonomous exosystem . according to this , the model of the disturbance has in fact determined the performance of the observation partly . however , in practice , a general disturbance is difficult to model as a finite - dimensional autonomous one , or with uncertainties . to tackle this difficulty",
