    "in the last few years , considerable progress towards an electronics based on single molecules has been made @xcite .",
    "nanotubes @xcite , fullerenes @xcite , and organic molecules @xcite have been contacted and current - voltage characteristics were measured .",
    "these experimental successes are accompanied by a vast body of theoretical studies @xcite which mostly concentrate on coherent transport through the molecules .",
    "however , relaxation processes on the molecule may lead to _ incoherent _ transport @xcite and some of the experimental data may be interpreted in this sense @xcite .    recently , petrov et al .",
    "@xcite have applied a nonlinear quantum kinetic statistical many - body approach in mean - field approximation to incoherent transport through short molecular wires in the limit of infinitely strong coulomb interaction .",
    "stimulated by this work , we discuss the charge transport through a single wire in the incoherent regime .",
    "assuming that relaxation processes on the wire units are much faster than the time scale for tunneling between different units , a description in terms of rate equations for the electronic state of the wire is then adequate .",
    "the main focus of this paper will be on the influence of coulomb interaction on the electronic transport .",
    "after introducing in section  [ sec : model ] a generic model for the molecular wire and discussing the voltage profile across the wire , the limit of strong coulomb repulsion will be considered in section  [ sec : nospin ] .",
    "this allows us to restrict the calculation to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumo ) and to neglect excitations to higher levels .",
    "in particular , this implies that temperature is sufficiently low so that the coulomb interaction exceeds the thermal energy . in section  [ sec : currentws ] we will include the spin degree of freedom for the electrons which had been neglected in section  [ sec : nospin ] . in this context",
    "the blocking of spin channels due to coulomb interaction will be discussed in detail .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : finitetemp ] we relax the requirement of strong coulomb interaction and study the different regimes arising from the interplay between coulomb repulsion and thermal fluctuations .",
    "in this paper , we will focus on generic properties of incoherent charge transport through a molecular wire . the model for the wire",
    "will consequently be kept as simple as possible : a linear array of @xmath0 identical wire units numbered consecutively from left to right is joined by @xmath1 identical molecular bridges denoted by `` m '' . in order to apply a voltage and to pass a current through the wire , the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wiremodel ] is used where two contacts `` c '' connect the wire to the electrodes marked by `` l '' and `` r '' .        except for section  [ sec : finitetemp ]",
    ", we will confine the discussion to the case of strong coulomb interaction .",
    "this prevents the wire from being charged with more than one electron . neglecting spin for the moment",
    ", the wire will then always be found in one of @xmath2 states : either the wire is in its ground state and all wire units are neutral , or exactly one of the units is charged by an additional electron .",
    "we will denote these states by `` 0 '' for a neutral wire or the number of the unit @xmath3 which carries an extra charge .",
    "since we are interested in the current across the molecule beyond linear response , we also need to specify the voltage drop along the wire . in principle , this requires the solution of the coupled schrdinger and poisson equations of the electrode - molecule - electrode system @xcite , which in itself presents a formidable task that we will not try to tackle .",
    "instead , we will use the simple model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which views the two electrodes as parallel plates forming a capacitor with the molecule in between acting like a dielectric .    within this picture one obtains a potential profile where the applied voltage @xmath4 drops partially by @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the left and right contact , respectively , and decreases linearly by @xmath7 along the wire .",

    "if one of these energy differences is negative , the absence of thermally activated processes will lead to a suppression of the current .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : voltagedrop ] where @xmath19 . if , on the other hand , the energy levels of the molecular sites lie between the electrochemical potentials in the two electrodes , a current may flow even at zero temperature . apart from section",

    ", the electrochemical potential @xmath20 in the right electrode is assumed to lie lower in energy , thereby favoring transport from left to right , which we will denote as forward direction .",

    "the incoherent electron transport through an individual wire shall be described as sequential tunneling events of an electron between the electrodes and the end units of the wire or between adjacent wire units .",

    "we will be particularly interested in the stationary case where the probabilities @xmath37 become time - independent .",
    "then , all currents ( [ eq : currcontact ] ) and ( [ eq : currwire ] ) will be equal , _",

    "as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1a])([eq:1d ] ) , the stationary probabilities @xmath37 depend only on ratios of transition rates .",
    "we therefore introduce the `` backward - forward '' ratios @xmath39 and the `` branching '' ratios @xmath40 the latter two relate molecular properties to contact properties and therefore depend on the microscopic details . the ratios ( [ eq:4 ] ) , on the other hand , combine backward and forward rates at the same contact or bridge .",
    "in order to ensure thermodynamic equilibrium they are given by boltzmann factors at inverse temperature @xmath41 @xmath42 where the energy differences have been introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dem])([eq : der ] ) .",
    "since all energy differences have to sum up to the difference in electrochemical potential between left and right electrode , _ i.e. _ @xmath43 the `` backward - forward '' ratios obey the relation @xmath44      in the following , we will restrict ourselves to the stationary case .",

    "the resulting expression can be cast into the form @xmath52 where we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath53 the current changes its sign when the applied voltage is reversed and at the same time forward and backward rates as well as left and right contacts are interchanged .",
    "this can be verified by noting that under these changes the coefficients ( [ eq:10a])([eq:10c ] ) are transformed according to @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "further insight into the result ( [ eq:10])([eq:10c ] ) can be gained by discussing several special cases .",
    "an important limit , which will be particularly relevant in the discussion of the following sections , is a wire consisting only of one unit and no bridges .",

    "it is instructive to compare the two models for the voltage profile introduced in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we start by considering _ model  a _ where the voltage drops only across the contacts . as a consequence ,",

    "the length dependence of the current can therefore be understood in terms of a random walk where the average time to diffuse across a wire of length @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath65 .    for _ model b _",
    ", where the voltage drops entirely along the wire , the same argument holds provided the thermal energy is much larger than the energy difference between adjacent sites , @xmath66 . at low temperatures , however , the situation differs qualitatively since the backward rates are negligibly small . in order to obtain a finite current even in the limit of zero temperature ,",
    "we assume that @xmath67 . at zero temperature ,",

    "the current now decreases linearly with the number of units or , equivalently , with the length of the wire . in this sense , for model b the wire resembles an ohmic resistor .",
    "the comparison of models  a and b demonstrates that the dependence of the current on the wire length at low temperatures may provide qualitative information about the voltage drop across the molecule . in any case",
    ", however , incoherent transport leads to an algebraic length dependence of the current in clear contrast to the exponential dependence characteristic for coherent transport @xcite .",
    "so far , we have ignored the spin degree of freedom of the electrons . in this section",
    ", we will take the spin into account but , due to the strong coulomb interaction , there will be not more than one electron present on the wire .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the two spin directions are equivalent and that no spin flips occur .",
    "inclusion of the electron spin increases the number of possible wire states to @xmath69",
    ". the wire can now either be neutral ( with probability @xmath70 ) or there can be an extra electron with spin up or down at site @xmath3 ( with probability @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ) .",
    "the possible transitions between the different states are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : statemodelws ] .",
    "we emphasize that , like in section  [ sec : nospin ] , all rates are to be understood as rates per spin direction . in the presence of a magnetic field , the two spin directions would no longer be equivalent and the rates would have to be distinguished by a spin index .     is generalized to include the electron spin .",
    "the two rings corresponding to the two spin directions are joined via the neutral state `` 0 '' of the molecule . ]    a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig : statemodel ] and [ fig : statemodelws ] shows that the two molecular parts are independent of the spin direction and correspond to the molecular part in the spinless case .",
    "the only difference lies in the coupling to the neutral state `` 0 '' .",
    "this motivates to introduce the total probability @xmath73 for an electron on site @xmath34 irrespective of its spin .",
    "the resulting master equation including the normalization condition is of the same form as eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:1a])([eq:1d ] ) in the spinless case .",
    "the only difference consists in a factor of 2 by which the rates @xmath59 and @xmath74 describing the charging of the wire have to be multiplied . for these rates ,",
    "the spin degree of freedom leads to an additional process allowing to occupy the wire .",
    "this is not the case for an electron leaving the wire . in this case",
    ", the spin is fixed and the corresponding rates @xmath75 and @xmath60 are not doubled .",
    "the appearance of a factor of 2 may also be understood in terms of the density of states in the electrodes which enters the tunneling rates .",
    "for tunneling of electrons onto the wire the number of initial states is increased by the spin degree of freedom thereby leading to an effective doubling of the density of states . on the other hand , for tunneling into the electrodes the density of final states",
    "is not increased since the spin is determined by the electron leaving the wire .",
    "taking into account the factor of 2 in the tunneling rates that populate the wire , one finds for the average current @xmath76 here , the probability @xmath46 implicitly contains a factor of 2 since the electron contributing to the backward current may carry either spin up or down . making the required modifications of the rates @xmath59 and @xmath74 , the current ( [ eq:10])([eq:10c ] ) turns into @xmath77 where the coefficients now are given by @xmath78 we remark , that due to the mutual blocking of the electrons one does not obtain an overall factor of 2 in the current relative to the spinless case ( [ eq:10])([eq:10c ] ) .",
    "instead , the current shows a more intricate influence of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the mechanism of blocking is particularly transparent if the wire consists of only one site , _ i.e. _ @xmath63 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of zero temperature where , as in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq:12a ] ) , all backward rates vanish .",
    "then the current ( [ eq:12c ] ) simplifies to read @xmath79 this result has to be compared with the case where the two spin directions lead to independent transport channels so that the expression ( [ eq:12a ] ) is multiplied by a factor of 2 yielding the current @xmath80 the effect of blocking due to the coulomb interaction is quantified by the ratio of the current ( [ eq:12 g ] ) in the presence of coulomb repulsion and the current ( [ eq : i0 ] ) in the absence of interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath81 the blocking is completely determined by the ratio @xmath82 of the rates through the left and right contacts and varies between 1 for @xmath83 and 1/2 for @xmath84 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ii0 ] .    ) due to coulomb interaction is plotted as a function of the ratio @xmath85 of the tunneling rates in the left and right contacts . ]",
    "this dependence on @xmath85 can be understood in terms of the average population of the wire which here is given by @xmath46 . from the stationary solution of the master equation for the case with spin and @xmath63 one obtains @xmath86 the blocking effect on the current ( [ eq : blocking ] ) may therefore be directly related to the average population of the wire by @xmath87 for small @xmath85 , or equivalently @xmath83 , the wire is depleted almost immediately after it has been populated .",
    "the average population of the wire therefore is very small and the passage of another electron is almost never blocked . in the opposite case of large @xmath85 , or @xmath84 ,",
    "the right contact represents a bottleneck which leads to a sizable average population of the wire and therefore to the blocking of transport .",
    "this result clearly shows , that inclusion of the spin degree of freedom does not necessarily lead to a doubling of the current as would be the case in the absence of coulomb interaction on the wire .",
    "apart from the interaction strength , the average population of the wire plays a decisive role and blocking is strongest when the right contact increases the population by acting as a bottleneck .",
    "the calculation of the current - voltage characteristics presented so far was based on the assumption that at any given time there is at most one extra electron on the wire .",
    "although it is straightforward to generalize the rate equations ( [ eq:1a])([eq:1d ] ) to more than one electron by extending the state space , in general one has to solve the rate equations numerically .",
    "some insight into the validity of the limit of strong coulomb interaction can be gained by allowing a second electron on the wire .",
    "then , an analytical treatment is still possible if we restrict the length of the wire to one site , _ i.e. _ @xmath63 .",
    "we will assume that this very site may be occupied by at most two electrons of opposite spin .",
    "then , there exist four different wire states , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , which correspond to no electron , one electron with spin up or down , and two electrons , respectively .",
    "the energies of these four states are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoelec ] where we allow for an interaction energy @xmath92 if two electrons are present on the wire . by changing both , the temperature as well as the one - electron energy @xmath9 relative to the left electrochemical potential",
    ", we may choose the levels which are relevant for the transport through the wire .     and 2 electrons .",
    "@xmath93 is the one - particle energy of the states @xmath89 and @xmath90 and @xmath92 is the coulomb interaction energy between the electrons occupying the site . ]",
    "the discussion in the last section has shown that the effect of blocking is most pronounced when the tunneling rates through the right contact are much smaller than through the left one .",
    "we therefore shall concentrate on this limit .",
    "then , the master equation for the probabilities @xmath94 of being in a state with @xmath95 or @xmath96 electrons depends only on the rates through the left contact .",
    "these tunneling rates may be identified by the change of the number of electrons .",
    "for example , @xmath97 refers to the backward rate through the left contact with initially two electrons on the molecule . with this notation",
    "the master equation reads @xmath98 with the normalization condition @xmath99 the rates @xmath100 and @xmath101 are each multiplied by a factor of 2 , thereby accounting for the two spin directions possible in these processes .",
    "the probability @xmath46 of finding one electron of arbitrary spin on the wire implicitly contains a factor of 2 in the same sense as was discussed after eq .",
    "( [ eq:12b ] ) .",
    "if the probabilities are calculated from the master equation ( [ eq : a1])([eq : a3 ] ) , thereby neglecting tunneling through the right contact , the current has to be evaluated at that contact .",
    "we will assume that the electrochemical potential in the right electrode is so low that the forward rates @xmath60 through the right contact are approximately independent of the occupation of the molecular site and that backward rates may be neglected .",
    "then , the stationary current is obtained as @xmath102 where the factor of 2 accounts for the two spin directions available when one of two electrons is leaving the molecule .    solving the master equation ( [ eq : a1])([eq : a3 ] ) in the stationary limit",
    ", we obtain from ( [ eq : currft ] ) for the current @xmath103 in order to study the effect of blocking , we have to compare this current with the current @xmath104 in the absence of coulomb interaction . in this case @xmath105 and @xmath106 and we find @xmath107 this result still depends on temperature and on the energy @xmath9 of the one - electron level relative to the left electrochemical potential .",
    "the ratio @xmath108 depends only on rate ratios which , as in section  [ subsec : nospinmaster ] , may be expressed in terms of boltzmann factors . for single occupation of the molecule , we have @xmath109 double occupancy costs the additional interaction energy @xmath92 , so that @xmath110 the blocking due to coulomb interaction is then described by @xmath111    figure  [ fig : ii0_t ] depicts this result as a function of @xmath112 for @xmath113 and 2000 .",

    "this is the blocking discussed already in section  [ sec : currentws ] . for @xmath120 ,",
    "double occupancy is possible even in the zero temperature limit and no blocking occurs . as can be seen from the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ii0_t ] , blocking is also absent for @xmath115 . in this case , the current as well as the occupation of the molecule approach zero exponentially for low temperatures . in analogy to the reasoning presented in section",
    "[ sec : currentws ] , blocking thus becomes ineffective .    for @xmath121 , a second regime appears at intermediate temperatures @xmath122 . for @xmath123 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ii0_t ] indeed shows a clear plateau at a blocking factor of 2/3 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that for @xmath124 the backward rate @xmath125 is of the order of the forward rate @xmath126 .",
    "this reduces the population of the molecule and therefore blocking is less effective than at lower temperatures .",
    "the reduction by a factor 2/3 can be understood even without recourse to eq .",
    "( [ eq : block_t ] ) .",
    "for equal forward and backward rates , the probabilities for an empty wire or a wire occupied with one electron of given spin are equal , leading to probabilities @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : currft ] ) one therefore finds @xmath130 . in the absence of coulomb interaction , double occupancy",
    "is allowed and one finds all four possible states with equal probability leading to @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "this yields the current @xmath134 , and thus the blocking factor reads @xmath135 .    finally , in the high - temperature regime , where @xmath136 , the thermal energy is much bigger than the interaction energy @xmath92 so that the latter becomes irrelevant .",
    "therefore , the coulomb interaction can no longer lead to blocking of the electronic transport .",
    "by 400 the influence of coulomb interaction on incoherent electronic transport through a molecular wire has been found to be multifaceted . in the regime of strong coulomb interaction",
    ", the current of spinless electrons shows an algebraic dependence on the wire length characteristic for incoherent transport .",
    "it was found , however , that this length dependence varies as a function of the voltage profile across the system . at low temperatures",
    "a @xmath64 behavior indicates the absence of a voltage drop along the molecule while in the presence of a voltage drop a @xmath137 behavior is expected",
    ".    by -400 inclusion of the spin degree of freedom in the absence of coulomb interaction leads to an increase of the current by a factor of 2 .",
    "coulomb interaction , on the other hand , should lead to a reduction of the current .",
    "it was found that this blocking effect not only depends on the interaction strength but also on the average population of the wire and thus on the tunneling rates ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ii0 ] ) .    for finite coulomb interaction ,",
    "the amount of blocking also depends on temperature . between the limits of suppression of the current by a factor of 2 at zero temperature and the absence of blocking at high temperatures",
    "an intermediate regime may exist .",
    "there , coulomb interaction prohibits double occupancy .",
    "nevertheless the current is only reduced by a factor of 2/3 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ii0_t ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the competition between backward and forward rates , which equally populates the two one - electron levels .    as a final remark , we mention that even though we have restricted ourselves to electronic transport , the approach presented here is also applicable to hole transport .",
    "depending on the situation , holes may be the dominant charge carriers ; the results presented above may easily be adapted to this case . on the other hand ,",
    "if both , holes and electrons , contribute to the transport , an extension similar to the one presented in section  [ sec : currentws ] , where spin is included , becomes necessary ."
