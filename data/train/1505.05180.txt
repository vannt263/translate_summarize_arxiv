    "<S> this process relies on non - degenerate four - wave mixing mediated by an effective negative cross - phase modulation term caused by cascaded soliton - probe sum - frequency generation .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical soliton is remarkably robust as it can both retain its shape despite dispersive or dissipative effects and survive wave collisions . </S>",

    "<S> such a collision can be well understood by generalizing the cherenkov phase - matching condition  degenerate four - wave mixing ( fwm )  to non - degenerate fwm where a soliton interacts with two linear dispersive waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is mediated by cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) : the collision between the soliton ( @xmath1 ) and a linear `` probe '' wave ( @xmath2 ) can become resonantly phase - matched to a new frequency ( the `` resonant '' wave @xmath3 ) according to the fwm phase - matching condition . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency - converts the probe to the resonant wave , which  when completely depleting the probe  gives rise to the peculiar appearance of the probe reflecting on the soliton : when the probe group velocity is higher than the soliton , the resonant wave group velocity will be lower than the soliton , and therefore travel away from the soliton after formation . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency - conversion process therefore in time domain leads to an apparent reflection of the probe on the soliton . </S>",
    "<S> soliton - probe collisions have been studied in fibers , which have a positive kerr nonlinearity . however , through cascaded ( strongly phase - mismatched ) quadratic nonlinear interactions an effective negative kerr - like nonlinearity may be generated ( in bulk this corresponds to a self - defocusing effect ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence soliton formation requires normal dispersion @xcite , and cherenkov phase - matching naturally occurs towards the red side of the soliton spectrum @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : pm](b ) implies that its group velocity is larger than the soliton . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore suitably delayed at the input so the interaction occurs over realistic crystal lengths . </S>",

    "<S> as these represent solitons they are in frequency domain still straight curves , but they are now tilted instead of flat as the group velocity is different from that at @xmath22 ; in wavelength domain this means that they are no longer represented as straight curves , but this is simply due to the @xmath49 relation . </S>",
    "<S> these curves explain how the resonant wave is found slightly more red - shifted than the @xmath30 case predicted . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that the cherenkov ( @xmath13 ) case can be seen in the spectrum , accurately predicted by the blue - shifted soliton phase - matching condition . </S>",

    "<S> the probe at 15 mm is around half depleted , giving most of its depleted energy to the resonant wave that is located at the same temporal position . </S>",
    "<S> after 30 mm the weak probe does not show on a linear scale ( in the plot it is amplified 10 times ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant wave is now delayed 400 fs and it is reduced in intensity and increased in time due to dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> it has a gaussian profile since it is a linear and not a soliton wave . </S>",

    "<S> the soliton initially looses around 2% of its energy through shg to the @xmath23-polarized sh [ ( e ) also shows the total @xmath23-polarized energy ] , causing the initial ripples at @xmath52 mm . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton - probe interaction occurs between @xmath53 mm , and the resonant wave builds up in energy . </S>",
    "<S> after 20 mm the probe is depleted . the energy ratio ( conversion efficiency ) of the resonant wave to the probe is around 0.72 , close to the limit posed by the photon - to - photon ratio @xmath54 as dictated by the manley - rowe relation . </S>",

    "<S> the detuning from gvm has traditionally been kept small to get a large reflection , with the dilemma that the resonant wavelength is almost identical to the probe [ see again fig . </S>",
