    "it is easy to check that conditioned on the fact that the protocol did not abort , the value of @xmath23 is unbiased .    _ a chain with 2 links _ : consider the scenario shown in fig .",

    "as in the quantum scenario @xcite , there exists one natural strategy to distill an unbiased secret bit between two arbitrary nodes , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , of a given lattice @xmath45 .",
    "this protocol consists in trying to convert each biased secret bit ( corresponding to each edge of the lattice ) into an unbiased secret bit , each conversion succeeding with some probability @xmath46 .",
    "if there exists a path among the edges of the unbiased secret bit graph connecting nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 , then , using one - time pad along this path , one can produce a secret bit between nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "based on percolation theory , one can show that the probability that two arbitrary nodes are connected by a path does not depend on their distance in the graph if @xmath46 is larger than the critical percolation threshold probability @xmath47 of the lattice .",
    "for @xmath48 the success probability of the overall procedure decreases exponentially with the distance in the lattice between the two nodes ( see appendix [ percolation ] for details ) . the question that one wishes to answer",
    "is whether or not this simple strategy is optimal and whether the bound corresponding to @xmath47 is tight .",
    "in the case of entanglement percolation , it was shown in @xcite that the strategy described above is asymptotically optimal in the case of one - dimensional chains but not in general for two - dimensional lattices . in the following , we show that these two statements also apply to the case of secret classical correlations .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional chain with @xmath49 links and @xmath50 nodes : @xmath51 .",
    "each link @xmath52 corresponds to a pair of biased perfectly correlated variables , as in eq.([biased ] ) . because each pair is perfectly correlated , we simplify the discussion by noting @xmath53 the single bit shared by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as shown in fig .",

    "we will now show that the probability of establishing a perfect secret bit between the extremities of a chain , ( between @xmath60 and @xmath56 ) decreases exponentially fast with @xmath49 , except if the chain is initially composed of perfect secret bits , _",
    "i.e_. , if @xmath64 . hence , with that respect , distribution of secrecy and distribution of entanglement display the same behavior in the case of one - dimensional chains .",
    "let us first start with the smallest , but non - trivial , case of 2 links .",
    "the general proof will then follow by induction . as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_chain ] , nodes @xmath60 and @xmath65 share the biased secret bit @xmath36 and nodes @xmath65 and @xmath66 share @xmath37 .",
    "both bits , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are biased and have value 0 with probability @xmath67 .",
    "the goal is for @xmath60 and @xmath66 is to distill a secret bit unknown to eve , who had no prior information on @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in order to succeed ,",
    "node @xmath65 has to publicly announce some information , @xmath68 , depending on his own bits @xmath36 and @xmath37 and possibly on some random ancillary bits .",
    "this public information should allow nodes @xmath60 and @xmath66 to distill a secret bit , without giving any information to eve .",
    "in full generality , node @xmath65 may use a probabilistic strategy to generate @xmath68 .",
    "however , because every probabilistic strategy is a convex combination of deterministic ones , a probabilistic strategy can not be better than the best deterministic one .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider the set of deterministic functions @xmath69 . since @xmath65 simply needs to tell node @xmath66 whether it should keep its bit @xmath70 or flip it in order to match the secret bit @xmath36",
    ", @xmath68 only needs to take 2 possible values , 0 or 1 . as a consequence ,",
    "we only need to analyse 16 possible functions @xmath71 of @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ". the constraints of the problem help us find the only possibility for @xmath71 .",
    "first , node @xmath66 should be able to recover @xmath36 from the knowledge of @xmath37 and @xmath68 , imposing @xmath72 .",
    "second , eve should not learn any information about @xmath36 , imposing @xmath73 . up to a relabeling ,",
    "the only function that satisfies these constraints is the _ exclusive or _ ( xor ) : @xmath74 .",
    "it is not surprising that we obtain exactly the one - time pad protocol , which achieves a success probability of @xmath22 for a three node chain , as shown before .",
    "_ generalization to @xmath49 links _ : in a scenario with more links , it is easy to see that the same reasoning applies . in particular , all the intermediate nodes should announce the xor of their two bits , up to some relabeling .",
    "the protocol is therefore the following .",
    "each intermediate node @xmath55 ( for @xmath75 ) publicly announces @xmath76 .",
    "the final node can then compute the value of @xmath36 since @xmath77 .",
    "once nodes @xmath60 and @xmath56 share this ( biased ) secret bit , they can proceed with the optimal probabilistic conversion protocol of theorem [ prob_conversion ] and end up with a unbiased secret bit .",
    "the average success probability reads @xmath78 where @xmath79 corresponds to the success probability of conversion of the bit given that the vector announced by the intermediate nodes is @xmath80 .",
    "the success probability is equal to ( twice ) the first half of the binomial expansion ( see appendix [ analysis ] ) : @xmath81 which can be lower bounded , as shown in the appendix [ analysis ] , by @xmath82 despite doing better than the straighforward strategy , which gives a success probability of @xmath83 , it still decreases exponentially fast with @xmath49 for initial unbiased secret bit ( @xmath84 ) , similarly as in the quantum scenario @xcite .",
    "this result is not surprising as for percolation to occur , it is crucial that the topology of the network allows for many different paths between two given nodes to exist , which is not possible in a one - dimensional chain .",
    "a possible strategy to distill a secret - key between arbitrary nodes of a lattice consists in using the straightforward strategy presented in section [ straightforward ] .",
    "first , one tries to distill a secret bit over each link in the lattice .",
    "if the probability of success is above the percolation threshold of the lattice , then with a positive probability , this procedure created a path consisting of secret bits between the two arbitrary nodes .",
    "this path can then be used to establish a secret bit between these two nodes thanks to one - time pad .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we now give an explicit example of a 2-dimensional lattice where local preprocessing and public communication allows one to change the topology of the initial lattice into another one with a lower percolation threshold .",
    "this shows that there exist non - trivial strategies that succeed to establish a secret bit between two nodes when the naive strategy would fail .",
    "the protocol involves three basic operations that were described in section [ model ] : ( i ) the conversion of a single link into an sbit with success probability @xmath85 ; ( ii ) the conversion of two consecutive links into an sbit , also with success probability @xmath86 ; ( iii ) the conversion of two parallel links , with success probability @xmath87 .",
    "let us consider an initial honeycomb ( hexagonal ) lattice , as shown in figure [ lattice ] , where each link of the lattice consists of 2 biased secret - key bits with parameter @xmath62 .",
    "for this lattice , the naive strategy of section [ straightforward ] succeeds with constant probability as soon as @xmath88 , where the percolation threshold probability for the honeycomb lattice is given by @xmath89 therefore , the straightforward percolation strategy succeeds only for @xmath90 .    as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , one might consider a more elaborate strategy , namely , one can try to change the topology of the lattice in order to facilitate percolation .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the idea is that half the nodes from the original lattice should work together in order to create a triangular lattice . to do that",
    ", these nodes perform one - time pad over each pair of connected biased secret - key bits .",
    "it is easy to see that each link of the triangular lattice will be distilled into an sbit with probability @xmath91 .",
    "percolation can then occur as soon as @xmath92 exceeds the threshold percolation probability of the triangular lattice , @xmath93 this `` topology conversion '' strategy is therefore compatible with percolation of sbits for @xmath94 .",
    "we conclude that in the regime where @xmath95 $ ] , percolation can occur if the nodes use the non - trivial percolation strategy consisting in changing the topology of the lattice from honeycomb to triangular , while the straightforward strategy fails .",
    "other quantum percolation examples @xcite can also been easily adapted to the secet - key percolation scenario , using the tools presented here .",
    "in this paper , using known analogies between entanglement and classical secret - key correlations , we have studied secrecy percolation in networks .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that local operations and public communication can be used to change the topology of a secrecy network and to establish a secret key between nodes , in a regime where the initial lattice configuration is not compatible with percolation of secrecy .",
    "this effect was already known to exist in quantum entanglement networks .",
    "our work shows that this phenomenon thought to be of a genuine quantum nature , already appears in the context of classical secret correlations .",

    "a. l. received financial support from the eu erc starting grant percent .",
    "p . acknowledges financial support from the w. m. keck foundation center for extreme quantum information theory and the alexander von humboldt foundation .",
    "@xcite , the authors characterized the set of transformations which are allowed among probability distributions .",
    "their characterization is reminiscent of the quantum case @xcite and uses the same notion of majorization .        whereas theorem [ determ_conversion ] is only concerned with conversion strategies which work with probability 1 , the following result deals with strategies which work with a finite probability .",
    "note that again , one recovers the same result as in the quantum case @xcite .",
    "the percolation behaviors that appear in the context of quantum networks or secrecy networks are closely related to the concept of bond - percolation .",
    "the scenario of bond - percolation is the following .",
    "consider a lattice @xmath106 such that for each edge of @xmath106 , the bond is open ( or equivalently , the edge is present ) with probability @xmath62 .",
    "taking the limit where the size of @xmath106 is infinite , one can define the probability @xmath107 that a randomly chosen node belongs to a cluster of infinite size .",
    "then , there exists a critical percolation probability @xmath108 such that :      the link to our problem is immediate .",
    "given two arbitrary nodes of the lattice , one is interested in whether an unbiased secret bit can be established between them . in the case where there exists an infinite size component , then both nodes belong to this cluster with probability @xmath113 and an unbiased secret bit can be established between them . otherwise , if there is no cluster of infinite size , the probability of establishing an unbiased secret bit decreases exponentially with the distance between the nodes in the lattice @xmath45 .",
    "let us consider the same scenario of a chain of @xmath49 links where each link is a biased secret bit that takes value 1 with probability @xmath17 , and bound the probability of creating a secret bit between the extremities .    as we saw in section [ only_protocol ] ,",
    "the protocol consists first in publicly announcing the vector @xmath114 , and then conditionally on the value of @xmath115 , try to convert the bit shared by @xmath60 and @xmath56 into an sbit .",
    "the probability of success @xmath116 of this procedure is therefore given by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 corresponds to the success probability of conversion of the bit given that the vector announced by the intermediate nodes is @xmath80 .",
    "putting everything together , one has @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 denotes the hamming weight of the vector @xmath124 and `` first half '' means that the sum contains exactly the first half of the binomial expansion , that is , the @xmath125 first terms of this expansion ."
