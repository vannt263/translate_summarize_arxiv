    "the soft x  ray spectra of luminous low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are believed to originate in geometrically thin accretion disks around neutron stars with weak surface magnetic fields ( see for e.g. white 1995 ) .",
    "an important parameter in modeling these spectra is the maximum value of the effective temperature in the accretion disk .",
    "the effective temperature profile in the disk can be estimated ( assuming the disk to radiate from its surface like a blackbody ) if one knows the accretion energy released in the disk . in a newtonian treatment ,",
    "the innermost region of an accretion disk surrounding a neutron star with weak magnetic field will extend rather close to the neutron star surface .",
    "the amount of energy released in the disk will be one  half of the total accretion energy , the other half being released in the thin boundary layer between the disk s inner edge and the neutron star s surface .",
    "this then gives the disk effective temperature @xmath0 varying with the radial distance @xmath1 as @xmath2 and the maximum effective temperature @xmath3 will depend on the ( nonrotating ) neutron star mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the steady state mass accretion rate .",
    "the value of @xmath3 in the disk , in this approach , occurs at a radial distance @xmath8 .",
    "mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1984 ) parameterized the disk spectrum by the maximum temperature of the disk , using the above formalism and assuming the mass of the neutron star is equal to @xmath9  @xmath10 .",
    "these authors assumed that the inner parts of the disk do not contribute to the x  ray spectrum , and suggested a multi  color spectrum for the x  ray emission from the disk .",
    "it was shown by these authors , that the observed spectra of sco x1 , 160852 , gx 349 + 2 and gx 51 , obtained with the _ tenma _ satellite , can be well fitted with the sum of a multi  color spectrum and a single blackbody spectrum ( presumably coming from the boundary layer ) .",
    "white , stella & parmar ( 1988 ) ( wsp ) suggested that the simple blackbody accretion disk model should be modified to take into account the effects of electron scattering . using _",
    "exosat _ observations , these authors compared the spectral properties of the persistent emission from a number of x  ray burst sources with various x  ray emission models .",
    "this work suggests that either the neutron star ( in each system considered ) rotates close to equilibrium with the keplerian disk , or that most of the boundary layer emission is not represented by a blackbody spectrum .    for accretion disks around compact objects ,",
    "one possibility is that of the accretion disk not being keplerian in nature . for e.g. titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 )",
    "have formulated a boundary problem in which the keplerian accretion flow in the inner disk is smoothly adjusted to the neutron star rotation rate .",
    "the generality of such a formulation permits application even to black holes , but only for certain assumed inner boundary conditions .",
    "these authors demonstrate that there exists a transition layer ( having an extent of the order of the neutron star radius ) in which the accretion flow is sub - keplerian",
    ". an attractive feature of this formalism is that it allows super - keplerian motion at the outer boundary of the transition layer , permitting the formation of a hot blob that ultimately bounces out to the magnetosphere .",
    "this formalism ( titarchuk & osherovich 1999 ; osherovich & titarchuk 1999a ; osherovich & titarchuk 1999b ; titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov 1999 ) therefore provides a mechanism for the production of high frequency quasi  periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in the x  ray flux from several lmxbs .",
    "such effects , when taken into account , can modify the newtonian disk temperature profile ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ) .",
    "there are several other effects which will modify the newtonian disk temperature profile , such as the effects of general relativity and of irradiation of the disk by the central neutron star .",
    "the wind mass loss from the disk and the residual magnetic field near the disk s inner edge may also play a part in modifying the effective temperature ( knigge 1999 ) .",
    "czerny , czerny & grindlay ( 1986 ) calculated lmxb disk spectra assuming that a disk radiates locally as a blackbody with the energy flux detemined by viscous forces , as well as irradiation by the boundary layer , and took into account relativistic effects , some of them in an approximate way .",
    "the possible effects of general relativity were also discussed by hanawa ( 1989 ) , using the schwarzschild ( nonrotating ) metric , assuming that the neutron star radius is less than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( @xmath11 ) , which they identified as the disk inner boundary .",
    "the color temperature was assumed to be higher than the effective temperature by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "it was found by hanawa ( 1989 ) that the observations are consistent with a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk , whose inner edge is at @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the schwarzschild radial coordinate .",
    "an important dynamical aspect of disk accretion on to a weakly magnetized neutron star is that the neutron star will get spun up to its equilibrium period , which is of the order of milliseconds ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 , and refereces therein ) .",
    "the effect of rotation is to increase the equatorial radius of the neutron star , and also to relocate the innermost stable circular orbit ( for a corotating disk ) closer to the stellar surface ( as compared to the schwarzschild case )",
    ". these effects will be substantial for rapid rotation rates in a fully general relativistic treatment that includes rotation .",
    "therefore , for accreting neutron stars with low magnetic fields , the stellar radius can be greater or less than the radius of the innermost stable orbit , depending on the neutron star equation of state and the spacetime geometry",
    ". the effect of magnetic field will be to constrain the location of the inner  edge of the accretion disk to the magnetospheric ( alfven ) radius .",
    "in such a case , @xmath14 would lose the astrophysical relevance as discussed here . however , this will be so only if the magnetic field strength ( @xmath15 ) is large . the problem addressed in this paper",
    "refer to lmxbs which contain old neutron stars which are believed to have undergone sufficient magnetic field decay ( bhattacharya & datta 1996 ) . clearly ,",
    "for low magnetic field case , a number of different disk geometries will be possible if general relativistic effects of rotation are taken into account .",
    "these structural differences influence the effective temperature profile and the conclusions derived by czerny , czerny & grindlay ( 1986 ) and hanawa ( 1989 ) are likely to be modified .    in this paper , we attempt to highlight the effects brought in due to general relativity and rotation of the neutron star on the accretion disk temperature profile and then apply this to the particular case of the x  ray source cygnus x2 . for simplicity",
    "( unlike titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) , we assume the accretion disk to be fully keplerian , geometrically thin and optically thick .",
    "we first give a theoretical estimate of the modifications in @xmath16 that would result if inclusion is made of the rotational effects of general relativity , and illustrate these by taking representative neutron star equations of state .",
    "we then consider a model for the spectrum parameterized by the mass accretion rate , the color factor , and the rotation rate of the accreting neutron star ( assumed to be weakly magnetized ) .",
    "we derive constraints on these parameters for the x  ray source cygnus x2 , for which we take the estimates of @xmath17 , the disk luminosity and boundary layer luminosity from the analysis of wsp .",
    "a conclusion of our work is that the neutron star in cygnus x2 has a rapid spin rate close to the centrifugal mass  shed limit .",
    "the format of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ii ] , we discuss the rotational general relativistic effects on the disk temperature , using a formalism given by page & thorne ( 1974 ) and the disk irradiation by the neutron star .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the temperature profiles with these effects taken into account are presented in section  [ sec : iii ] .",
    "section  [ sec : iv ] deals with comparison with observations , and its implications for parameters of our model for cygnus x2 . a summary and discussions",
    "are presented in section  [ sec : v ] .",
    "the effective temperature in the disk ( assumed to be optically thick ) is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the stephan  boltzmann constant and @xmath20 is the x  ray energy flux per unit surface area .",
    "we use the formalism given by page & thorne ( 1974 ) , who gave the following general relativistic expression for @xmath20 emitted from the surface of an ( geometrically thin and non self  gravitating ) accretion disk around a rotating black hole : @xmath21 where @xmath22 here @xmath14 is the disk inner edge radius , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the specific energy and specific angular momentum of a test particle in a keplerian orbit and @xmath25 is the keplerian angular velocity at radial distance @xmath13 . in our notation ,",
    "a comma followed by a variable as subscript to a quantity , represents a derivative of the quantity with respect to the variable .",
    "also , in this paper , we use the geometric units @xmath26 .    for accreting neutron stars located within the disk inner edge ,",
    "the situation is analogous to the black hole binary case , and the above formula , using a metric describing a rotating neutron star , can be applied directly for our purpose . however , unlike the black hole binary case , there can be situations for neutron star binaries where the neutron star radius exceeds the innermost stable circular orbit radius .",
    "in such situations , the boundary condition , assumed by page & thorne ( 1974 ) , that the torque vanishes at the disk inner edge will not be strictly valid .",
    "use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : teff ] ) will then be an approximation .",
    "this will affect the temperatures close to the disk inner edge , but not the @xmath17 to any significant degree ( see section 5 for discussion ) . in order to evaluate @xmath27 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : teff ] ) , we need to know the radial profiles of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for this",
    ", we have to first compute the equilibrium sequences of neutron stars in rapid rotation .",
    "these can be calculated by noting that the space ",
    "time around a rotating neutron star can be described by the following metric ( cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) : @xmath28 where the metric potentials @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the angular velocity ( @xmath32 ) of the stellar fluid relative to the local inertial frame are all functions of the quasi  isotropic radial coordinate ( @xmath33 ) and polar angle ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "@xmath33 is related to the schwarzschild radial coordinate ( @xmath13 ) through the equation @xmath35 .    on the assumptions that the matter is a perfect fluid and that the space  time described by metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) is stationary , axisymmetric , asymptotically flat and reflection  symmetric ( about the equatorial plane ) , the einstein field equations reduce to three non  homogeneous , second  order , coupled differential equations ( for @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 ) and one ordinary differential equation ( for @xmath31 ) in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( the total energy density and the pressure of neutron star matter respectively ) in addition to terms involving @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 and @xmath31 ( see komatsu , eriguchi & hachisu 1989 ) .",
    "we have solved these equations ( self  consistently and numerically ) to obtain @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( which is the angular velocity of the neutron star matter as measured by a distant observer ) as functions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the angular velocity enters in the equations through the rotation law ( which must be specified ) for the matter distribution .",
    "the equilibrium solutions so obtained can then be used to calculate bulk structure parameters such as gravitational mass @xmath39 , equatorial radius @xmath40 , angular momentum @xmath41 , etc . of the rotating neutron star .",
    "we assume that the neutron star rotates rigidly .",
    "thus , @xmath38 is constant for the stellar matter distribution , and is taken to be equal to @xmath42 , defined as the angular velocity of the neutron star as measured by a distant observer .",
    "( [ eq : teff ] ) gives the effective disk temperature @xmath27 with respect to an observer comoving with the disk . from the observational viewpoint this temperature",
    "must be modified , taking into account the gravitational redshift and the rotational doppler effect . in order to keep our analysis tractable",
    ", we use the expression given in hanawa ( 1989 ) for this modification : @xmath43 with this correction for @xmath44 , we define a temperature relevant for observations ( @xmath45 ) as : @xmath46      for the work presented in this paper , we compute constant gravitational mass ( @xmath39 ) equilibrium sequences for rigidly and rapidly rotating neutron stars using the formalism described above ( see datta , thampan & bombaci 1998 for details ) , keeping in mind the importance of the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath42 for modeling the x  ray emission from lmxbs . these sequences are constructed starting from the static limit all the way upto the rotation rate corresponding to the centrifugal mass shed limit .",

    "we now briefly describe how the quantities @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are calculated ; for details , the reader is referred to thampan & datta ( 1998 ) . for a material particle in the gravitational field described by metric  ( [ eq : metric ] ) ,",
    "we can write down ( see for e.g. misner , thorne & wheeler 1973 ) the equation of motion in the equatorial plane",

    "the spectrum from such a disk is the sum of blackbody emission with a temperature profile @xmath110 wsp have identified this temperature as the effective temperature which , as mentioned by them , is inconsistent since the accretion rate for cygnus x-2 is high ( @xmath111  g  s@xmath77 ) .",
    "however , as mentioned above , identifying this temperature profile as the color temperature makes the model consistent if the color factor is nearly independent of radius .",
    "moreover , the inferred temperature profile ( i.e. @xmath112 ) is similar to the one developed in previous section .",
    "therefore , in this paper we assume that the maximum of the best fit color temperature profile @xmath113 is related to the maximum temperature @xmath68 computed in previous section by ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "shimura & takahara ( 1988 ) suggested a value of @xmath115 for the factor @xmath100 , for an assumed neutron star mass equal to @xmath9  @xmath10and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the eddington luminosity , with the mass to energy conversion efficiency taken as unity .",
    "for the source cygnus x2 , the best spectral fit to the data is when @xmath118 k , @xmath119  ergs  s@xmath77 and @xmath120  ergs  s@xmath77 ( wsp ) , where @xmath121 is the disk luminosity and @xmath122 , the luminosity in the boundary layer .",
    "the distance to the source and the inclination angle to the source have been estimated by orosz & kuulkers ( 1998 ) to be @xmath123 kpc and @xmath124 respectively . from these values",
    "one can obtain , using the formalism described in section 2 , the angular velocity of the neutron star ( @xmath125 ) for a given neutron star mass , accretion rate ( @xmath126 ) , color factor @xmath100 and equation of state .",
    "however , in order to make allowance for the uncertainties in the fitting procedure and in the value of @xmath127 , and also those arising due to the simplicity of the model , we consider a range of acceptable values for @xmath113 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "in particular , we allow for deviations in @xmath113 and the best fit luminosities : we take two combinations of these , namely , ( @xmath128% , @xmath84% ) and ( @xmath129% , @xmath130% ) , where the first number in parentheses corresponds to the error in @xmath113 and the second to the error in the best fit luminosities",
    ". note that we neglect the irradiation temperature here , as @xmath131 at the inner region of the disk ( the region where the disk temperature reaches a maximum ) .",
    "the constraints on @xmath7 , @xmath42 , and @xmath100 are calculated for two values of the mass of the neutron star in cygnus x2 , namely , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we obtain a range of consistent values for @xmath126 , @xmath125 and @xmath100 ( and hence , allowed ranges of different quantities ) .",
    "the procedure is as follows .    as described in previous section",
    ", we can calculate the different quantities ( @xmath52 , @xmath51 , @xmath68 , @xmath40 , @xmath14 , etc . ) as a function of @xmath125 . taking the observed ( or fitted ) values for @xmath113 , @xmath122 and ( @xmath134 ) with the error bars",
    ", we have two limiting values for each of these quantities .",
    "we assume a particular value for each of @xmath100 and @xmath126 , from which we obtain the corresponding fitted values of @xmath68 , @xmath51 and ( @xmath135 ) by the relations @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . by interpolation , we calculate two corresponding limiting @xmath125 s ( i.e. , the allowed range in @xmath125 ) for each fitted quantity .",
    "we take the common region of these three ranges , which is the net allowed range in @xmath125 .",
    "we do this for @xmath126 s in the range @xmath139 to @xmath140 ( which is reasonable for lmxb s ) with logarithmic interval 0.0001 , for a particular value of @xmath100 . if for some @xmath126 , there is no allowed @xmath125 , then that value of @xmath126 is not allowed .",
    "thus we get the allowed range of @xmath126 for a particular @xmath100 .",
    "next we repeat the whole procedure described above for various values of @xmath100 , in the range 1 to 10 . if for some @xmath100 , there is no allowed @xmath126 , then that @xmath100 is not allowed .",
    "thus we get an allowed range of @xmath100 . taking the union of all the allowed ranges of @xmath126",
    ", we get the net allowed range of @xmath126 ( and similarly the net allowed range of @xmath125 ) for a particular eos , gravitational mass and a set of error bars",
    ". the allowed range of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath40 , etc .",
    "then easily follow , since their general variations with respect to @xmath42 are already known .",
    "the results of this exercise for various equations of state is shown in table 2 . from table 2",
    "we can read off the allowed range in @xmath100 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath40 , @xmath69 , @xmath7 .",
    "for e.g. for gravitational mass @xmath80  @xmath10 , an assumed uncertainty of @xmath84% in the luminosity , and @xmath128% uncertainty in color temperature , these are respectively ( @xmath143@xmath144 ) , ( @xmath145@xmath146 )  khz , ( @xmath147@xmath148 )  khz , ( @xmath149@xmath150 )  km , ( @xmath151@xmath152 )  km , ( @xmath153@xmath154 )  @xmath117 .",
    "on relaxing the conditions on luminosity and color temperature to @xmath130% and @xmath129% respectively , the corresponding ranges change to ( @xmath155@xmath156 ) , ( @xmath157@xmath158 )  khz , ( @xmath159@xmath146 )  khz , ( @xmath160@xmath150 )  km , ( @xmath161@xmath162 )  km , ( @xmath163@xmath164 )  @xmath117 .",
    "the eos model ( a ) is the softest in the sample .",
    "the maximum mass of neutron stars ( at @xmath72 ) corresponding to this eos is 1.63 @xmath165 .",
    "so the constraint results for cygnus x2 , using this eos are done only for @xmath80  @xmath10 .",
    "since the luminosity in the boundary layer is about 10% of the disk luminosity , the neutron star is expected to be spinning close to the maximum allowed value .",
    "this is reflected in our results by the ratio of @xmath166 .",
    "in all these cases , the neutron star radius happens to be larger than the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "hence the radius of the inner edge of the disk coincides with the neutron star radius .",
    "therefore , the angular velocity of the particles in the disk inner edge will be very nearly equal to that of the neutron star .",
    "this implies that the viscous torque in the disk inner edge will not be very significant , and the use of the page & thorne ( 1974 ) formalism will not introduce any gross error in the constraint estimates presented by us .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the temperature profiles of accretion disks around rapidly rotating and non  magnetized neutron stars , using a fully general relativistic formalism .",
    "the maximum temperature and its location in the disk are found to differ substantially from their values corresponding to the schwarzschild space  time , depending on the rotation rate of the accreting neutron star .",
    "we have considered a model for the spectrum of the x  ray emission from the accretion disk , parameterized by the mass accretion rate , the color temperature , and the rotation rate of the star .",
    "we have compared the maximum effective temperature in the disk and the accretion luminosities ( corresponding to the disk and the boundary layer ) with the results of spectral fitting for the x  ray source cygnus x2 ( wsp ) , and derived constraints on these parameters for the neutron star in this x  ray binary .",
    "the main conclusion of our analysis is that the neutron star in cygnus x2 has a rapid spin rate ( close to the centrifugal mass shed value ) , and that the system has a fairly large accretion rate ( several times @xmath167  g  s@xmath77 ) .",
    "the low luminosity of the boundary layer compared to that of the disk for cygnus x2 is consistent with the above conclusion that the neutron star in this system has a rapid rotation rate .",
    "the low value of the ratio @xmath168 justifies our assumption that the radiation pressure is negligible in the disk , so that the geometrically thin approximation for the disk is reasonable . according to shimura & takahara ( 1988 ) , the spectrum from the disk",
    "can be represented as a multi - color blackbody only if @xmath169 .",
    "our results for cygnus x2 are in accord with this .",
    "interestingly , if we take the lower value @xmath170 for the color index @xmath100 ( shimura & takahara 1988 ) , we obtain a consistent set of results , except for the stiffest eos model ( d ) .",
    "this suggests that the comparatively lower values of @xmath100 would disfavor stiff eos for neutron star matter .",
    "however , if we take the value of @xmath107 , as reported by borozdin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , one would require an eos model that is stiffer than the stiffest used here , or a mass greater than @xmath66  @xmath10(if one uses the narrower limits on the luminosity and color temperature ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if one were to use the broader limits , the hardening factor @xmath107 is disallowed only by the softest eos model .",
    "we have assumed here that the magnetic field of the neutron star is weak , which implies that the radius of the last orbit of the accretion disk should be much greater than the alfvn radius ( @xmath171 ) ( e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , @xmath172 where @xmath39 is the mass of the neutron star , @xmath173 is the magnetic moment in units of @xmath174 g @xmath175 and @xmath171 is in cm .",
    "the above condition implies that for @xmath176 km .",
    ", @xmath177 and @xmath178 , the magnetic moment @xmath179 or the magnetic field in the surface should be less than @xmath180 g. so the conclusions presented by us will be valid for the neutron star magnetic field upto a few times @xmath181  g.    in our analysis , we have assumed that the the boundary layer between the disk and the neutron star surface does not affect the inner regions of the disk .",
    "this will be a valid approximation when the boundary layer luminosity is smaller than the disk luminosity , and the boundary layer extent is small compared to the radius of the star .",
    "the flux received at earth from this region is      where @xmath183 is the width of the boundary layer , @xmath184 kpc is the distance to the source , @xmath185 is the inclination angle and @xmath186 is the effective temperature .",
    "spectral fitting gives a best fit value for @xmath187 ergs sec@xmath77 @xmath188 and @xmath189 = 2.88/@xmath190  kev , where @xmath190 is the color factor for the boundary layer and @xmath191 is the color temperature of the boundary layer .",
    "using these values , @xmath192 0.2 @xmath193 km , which is indeed smaller than @xmath40 provided the boundary layer color factor @xmath190 is close to unity .",
    "this is supported by the work of london , taam & howard ( 1986 ) and ebisuzaki ( 1987 ) , who obtain @xmath194 .",
    "a few comments regarding the validity of the page & thorne ( 1974 ) formalism for accreting neutron star binaries are in order here . unlike for the case of black holes ,",
    "neutron stars possess hard surface that could be located outside the marginally stable orbit . for neutron star binaries ,",
    "this gives rise to a possiblity of the disk inner edge coinciding with the neutron star surface .",
    "we have assumed that the torque ( and hence the flux of energy ) vanishes at the disk inner edge even in cases where the latter touches the neutron star surface . in the case of rapid spin of the neutron star ( as we infer for cygnus x2 ) , the angular velocity of a particle in keplerian orbit at disk inner edge will be close to the rotation rate of the neutron star .",
    "therefore , the torque between the neutron star surface and the inner edge of the disk is expected to be negligible . independently of whether or not the neutron star spin is large",
    ", page & thorne ( 1974 ) argued that the error in the calculation of @xmath27 will not be substantial outside a radial distance @xmath195 , where @xmath195 is given by @xmath196 . in our calculation , we find that @xmath69 ( which is the most important region for the generation of x  rays ) is greater than @xmath195 by several kilometers for all the cases considered .",
    "the shortest time - scale of the system is given by the frequency in the innermost stable circular orbit ( @xmath197 , table 2 : column 5 ) .",
    "a periodic oscillation in the system should be at a frequency lower than @xmath197 ( unless the model invoked to explain the temporal behavior predicts substantial power in the second harmonic , i.e. , @xmath198 ) .",
    "the maximum frequency of the khz quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) observed for cygnus x-2 is 1005 hz ( wijnands et al .",
    "the stiffest eos , model ( d ) , will then be disfavored since @xmath199  khz for this model .",
    "further , the neutron star mass estimate in cygnus x-2 ( @xmath200 , orosz & kuulkers 1998 ) is not consistent with the soft eos model ( a ) .",
    "our analysis , therefore , favors neutron star eos model which are intermediate in the stiffness parameters .    we have not attempted to model the observed temporal behavior of the source , and in particular , the qpo observations .",
    "beat frequency models identify the peak separation of the two khz qpo observed with the neutron star spin rate . for cygnus x-2",
    "the observed peak separation is @xmath201 hz ( wijnands et al . 1998 ) which is smaller than the typical rotation frequencies calculated here .",
    "however , a pure beat - frequency model has been called into question due to several observations .",
    "for instance , @xmath202 has been observed to vary by about 40% for sco x-1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ) and the khz qpo frequencies have been found to be correlated with the break frequency ( @xmath203 20 hz ) of the power spectrum density .",
    "an alternate model , where the qpos are suggested to originate due to non ",
    "keplerian motion of matter in the disk ( titarchuk & osherovich 1999 ; osherovich & titarchuk 1999a ; osherovich & titarchuk 1999b ; titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov 1999 ) have been proposed .",
    "these authors have also demonstrated the model by applying it to particular sources .",
    "inclusion of this newtonian model into the framework of the calculations mentioned in this paper require a parallel formulation within the space  time geometry chosen herein .",
    "x - ray binaries like cygnus x-2 are believed to be the progenitors of the millisecond pulsars . therefore , the discovery of a pulsar with a period @xmath204 ms will strengthen the model presented in this paper , in terms of a rapidly rotating accreting neutron star .",
