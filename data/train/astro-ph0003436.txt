    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are produced as stars age .",
    "they are fundamental to understanding the evolution of stars whose initial mass lies below the supernova limit .",
    "classically , galactic pne have been divided in population classes according to their spatial distribution , kinematics , and chemical content @xcite .",
    "it appears that there are clearly different pn populations in the galaxy , from old disk population pne ( peimbert s type i ) to extreme pop ii pne , located in the galactic halo or in the bulge ( peimbert s type iv and v ) .",
    "the pn morphology varies systematically across these classes @xcite , and most of the type i pne are asymmetric in shape .",
    "more recent studies of large galactic pne samples have shown that , to first approximation , the morphology of pne is linked to the spatial distribution within the galaxy , and to the mass of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "the fact that most bipolar and quadrupolar pne lie on average closer to the galactic plane than round and elliptical pne , and that highly asymmetric pne appear to host the most massive central stars ( css ) , suggests that asymmetric pne are the likely progeny of a younger stellar population than symmetric pne .",
    "an important and long - standing astrophysical issue is the degree to which pne enrich heavy elements in the ism . in the galaxy ,",
    "pne supply almost an order of magnitude more mass per year than supernovae @xcite .",
    "depending on the progenitor s mass , pne are expected to enrich the ism with carbon and nitrogen @xcite .",
    "pne stellar progenitors undergo several dredge ups ( e.g. , iben & renzini 1983 ) , some of which enrich the surfaces with c and n. subsequent winds will carry the enriched gas into the ism .",
    "pne are known to account for half of the carbon and most of the nitrogen enrichment in the solar environment @xcite .",
    "therefore a study of c and n abundances relative to the elements which are not altered during the evolution of pne progenitors , such as ne , ar , and s , provides a means for gauging the efficacy of c - n enrichment rates by pne .",
    "abundance studies as a function of population class and morphological type have been carried out for galactic pne . however , since asymmetric pne lie close to the plane where foreground extinction is severe , and since such nebulae are also formed from the most massive progenitors , galactic pne suffer a serious selection bias for understanding enrichment rates by pne of different types .",
    "accordingly , we have begun a comprehensive survey of magellanic cloud pne in order to investigate these and other parameters in a large and well - understood sample .",
    "we are using _",
    "hst _ and stis in direct imaging and slitless spectroscopy mode for this survey , and our first observational results are described in @xcite . for our purposes",
    "the advantage of lmc pne is their relatively low foreground extinction ( i.e. , their low selection bias ) as well as their well determined distances .",
    "that is , abundance studies tend to be complete to a limiting nebular luminosity , which is far less of a bias than a brightness limited survey in the presence of highly variable extinction with galactic latitude .    in the study presented here",
    ", we have selected a subsample of lmc pne based solely on the availability of morphological information ( from _ hst _ images ) and relative chemical abundances ( from ground - based spectroscopy in the literature ) .",
    "hst _ data come from @xcite , from the _ hst _ data archive , and from the literature . in @xmath02",
    "we describe the database and the data analysis , and discuss the results ; and in @xmath03 we discuss the uncertainties and possible systematic effects .",
    "the morphological data used in this paper consist of all lmc pne observed in imaging mode with _ hst_. the sample includes the pre - refurbishment data set of pc1 and foc images ( see stanghellini et al .  1999 ) , the unpublished wfpc2 images in the hubble data archive ( _ hst _ program i d : 6407 , pi : dopita , cycle 6 ) , and the set of 27 lmc pne observed to date within our _ hst_/stis snapshot survey @xcite .",
    "the abundance data set was compiled from papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we have used abundances of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , argon , neon , and sulfur where available . however ,",
    "some of the quoted abundances are model dependent @xcite ; abundances therein were used only when the model independent values were not available .",
    "a discussion of the effects of the data set inhomogeneity is presented in the next section , along with a critical analysis of the published abundances , including uncertainties and systematic effects that could affect our conclusions .",
    "we classified pn morphologies homogeneously according to their shape in narrow - band [ ] @xmath15007 images : round , elliptical , bipolar , bipolar core @xcite , quadrupolar , and point - symmetric pne are included in the sample . while classifying the images , we realized that in a few cases the morphologies are uncertain .",
    "these objects are not included in the numerical analysis and discussion , nor in the figures .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the distribution of the morphological types with respect to neon , argon , and sulphur abundances , which have presumably remain unchanged since the birth of the progenitor star . as such",
    ", these elements should be good indicators of the population type of the progenitor stars . the crossed large circles in these figures marks the location of the _ average _ abundance for lmc regions @xcite . these and other young population lmc abundances are given in table 1 , discussed below .",
    "the segregation of morphological type with respect to s and to ne ( fig .",
    "1 ) is striking ; ar does not appear to be as good a discriminant ( fig .",
    "specifically , the overwhelming majority of pne with log ne + @xmath2 are asymmetric , and none is round .",
    "furthermore , all pne with log ne + @xmath3 are symmetric , with the exception of one quadrupolar pn . evidently , pn morphology is a good indicator of progenitor population in the lmc . by comparing the ne abundance in pne with the average for regions ( which gives a good indication of the abundance of the young stellar population )",
    ", it is evident that most of the asymmetric pne are enriched with respect to the young population , while the opposite holds for symmetric pne .",
    "sulfur is related to nebular shape in a similar way .",
    "in fact , only one of the 13 symmetric pne has s larger than the lmc region average , and three asymmetric pne are under - abundant with respect to the regions .    to quantify the importance of the neon , sulphur , and argon overabundance in asymmetric pne , in table 1 we list the average abundances for our pn sample , together with the abundances of other significant lmc objects , namely",
    ", regions and supernova remnants : column ( 1 ) lists the atom ; in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we give the average elemental abundances for the symmetric and asymmetric pne of our samples , in the usual form 12+log ( n / h ) , with the sample size in parenthesis ; column ( 4 ) gives the lmc region average from @xcite , as used in our figures ; columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) give the abundance ranges found by @xcite respectively in lmc regions and lmc supernova remnants .",
    "the ranges are only indicative of the abundance distribution on the lmc , since they include a few observed objects for each diagnostics .",
    "the ratio of the average neon abundance for asymmetric to symmetric pne in the lmc , 1.7 , is similar to that found in the galaxy , 1.6 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the galactic average is based on a sample that is markedly biased toward the symmetric pne ( see @xmath01 ) . a similar overabundance in asymmetric pne is found for sulfur and argon ,",
    "although in these cases this includes a few pne that do not follow the abundance - morphology relation .    figure 3 shows the oxygen distribution among different population pne .",
    "oxygen yield should be invariant with respect to progenitor mass or other parameters , at least in the lmc @xcite .",
    "data shown in figure 3 are consistent with the expectation that the oxygen abundance are within the same range in symmetric and asymmetric pne . these results from our limited sample suggest that progenitors of asymmetric pne were formed in an enriched environment that is typical of a very young stellar population , while precursors of symmetric pne formed in a medium that was under - abundant with respect to the lmc region average .",
    "pne split into two distinct population groups according to alpha - element ( neon , argon , sulphur ) abundance and morphology .",
    "in order to compare our findings with the analysis of galactic pne , we looked for spatial segregation of symmetric and asymmetric pne .",
    "although the sample size is modest , we did not find such a strong spatial segregation of lmc pne across morphological type , or of their location with respect to the lmc bar or any other particular region , with the exception of a very slight predominance of asymmetric pne along , rather than perpendicular to , the bar .",
    "this result is consistent with the short dynamical mixing time of the lmc , and we should not expect a marked segregation of stellar populations as is found , for example , in spiral galaxies .    a number of theoretical models @xcite predict that lower - mass pn precursors typically go through the carbon stars phase , while the hot - bottom burning ( hbb ) takes place in higher mass precursors and prevents carbon star formation .",
    "this aspect of stellar evolution does not depend dramatically on the initial composition , and in particular for lmc pne one expects the same carbon depletion and nitrogen enrichment above @xmath44 @xmath5  of main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "observations of galactic pne support the theory , in that there seem to be two agb star types characterized by distinct carbon - enriched or depleted dust @xcite .",
    "then how do carbon and nitrogen abundances correlate with morphology in the lmc ?",
    "we plot nitrogen against carbon abundance in figure 4 .",
    "it is clear that symmetric pne are well confined in such a plot , and all symmetric pne are carbon - enriched with respect to the lmc region average .",
    "the situation for asymmetric pne is rather different : they are al nitrogen - enriched , yet three of them are also carbon - enriched with respect to the region average .",
    "the figure could be interpreted as follows : low mass stars ( @xmath6 @xmath5  on main sequence ) go through the carbon star phase , and do not produce asymmetric pne .",
    "the high mass stars do not go through the carbon star phase , they suffer hbb on the agb , and they produce asymmetric pne . some of the low - mass stars producing carbon stars also end up as asymmetric pne , perhaps through the common envelope phase .",
    "a discussion of the formation mechanisms for asymmetric pne is in order , in light of our findings .",
    "if asymmetry in pne were due uniquely to common envelope evolution , or binary evolution in general , we would not expect to find any of the separations among morphological classes that we show in figures 1 though 3 .",
    "that is , we do not expect the incidence of close binaries to vary as a function of the mass of the pn progenitor .",
    "though this is a qualitative statement , it is substantiated by other observations ( i.  e. , the existence of bipolar pne that do not show an equatorial ring , such as the galactic pn hubble 5 ) , and studies of the initial mass function . on the other hand",
    ", there may be a small fraction of asymmetric pne that are developed as a consequence of close binary evolution , and this is also supported by observations",
    ". it may be that we are very far from understanding how the morphology of pne is created , as there are a large number of variables in this game .",
    "what we can conclude with some certainty is that asymmetry in pne is related to the population type , and by inference the mass of the progenitor star .",
    "any model for the formation of pne that predicts the morphology must be consistent with this relationship .",
    "if the results of the previous sections are borne out by additional observations and analysis , the effect on subsequent interpretations of pn formation and evolution could be substantial . in this section",
    "we take a critical look at the derivation of the chemical abundances that are the underpinning of the conclusions presented here .",
    "the first step is to give some information on the abundance uncertainties as derived from the original papers .",
    "none of the references that we have used for abundance cite individual errors .",
    "@xcite do not discuss errors , but from the errorbars in their fig .",
    "7 it is possible to infer that the n , o , and c abundances are good to 0.1 dex , while the errors on the alpha - elements are about 0.08 dex .",
    "we should infer similar uncertainties for @xcite , since the three papers use the same abundance determination method .",
    "@xcite evaluate that their oxygen and neon abundances are good to 0.1 or 0.15 dex , while neon and argon abundances are more uncertain , up to 0.2 dex . finally , @xcite determine that most elemental abundances are good to 0.1 dex , with the exception of nitrogen , whose uncertainty is up to 0.2 dex or more .",
    "the potential for systematic errors from using different sources of abundance in the literature is worrisome enough to warrant some scrutiny .",
    "we compared the abundances from different bibliographic sources , and found that the values from @xcite and @xcite agree , within the quoted errors , with the abundances by @xcite . plotting the results of pairs of references shows only a scatter in the final results for most elements with no systematic differences .",
    "the only element that is worrisome is nitrogen . @xcite give a nitrogen abundance that is systematically about 0.3 dex higher than other authors .",
    "however , omitting the work of any one paper does not change the qualitative results of fig .",
    "4 . in particular",
    ", any discrepancies do not correlate with the ionization states of the nebulae is the dominant ionization state , while in high ionization pne the o@xmath7 state dominates . ] .",
    "most abundances are derived from observations using some form of the ionization correction method to convert from measured ionic abundances to total abundances .",
    "an ionization correction `` factor '' ( icf ) for unseen ionization states is required in this conversion .",
    "@xcite found that the icfs are very large in the case of low ionization nebulae , giving , for example , artificially high neon or sulphur abundances that in principle could alter the effects seen in figures 1 though 3 .",
    "we explored the original line intensity lines used for abundance calculation by @xcite , and @xcite , and we related the ionization level from the [ ] to h@xmath8  line ratio , to the morphological type .",
    "the question becomes whether those classes of pne with segregated abundances have systematically low or high ionization .",
    "we found no correlation between ionization level and morphology in our combined sample .",
    "most of the nebulae show high ionization , and the few low - ionization objects are equally distributed among symmetric and asymmetric pne .",
    "the only exception to this rule concerns extremely bipolar pne ( indicated with a filled square in the figures ) . among four of such pne ,",
    "three are low ionization .",
    "eliminating these extreme bipolars from the plots would not change the conclusions of this paper .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xcite compared icf abundances to those of model computation , and they find that ne / h is the most reliable measure of the abundance of primordial elements since the o++ and ne++ volumes are very similar and the corrections for unseen ionization states are relatively small .    in general ,",
    "lmc pne are point - sources when observed from the ground , and the line intensities quoted in the literature typically refer to the global volume of the nebulae , thus the icf problem here is minimal @xcite .",
    "in fact , often magellanic cloud pne are discovered via [ ] imaging ( or [ ] must have been present in an objective prism spectrum ) , so fewer pne in our sample have low ionization .",
    "one last concern comes from the possibility that the line intensities used for abundances calculation suffer from alteration due to the presence of a shock front .",
    "this is particularly worrisome for the sulphur abundances .",
    "in fact , artificially high sulphur abundances may derive from excessively high intensities of the low - ionization states of sulphur .",
    "we have checked the line intensities for all pne with 12+log(s / h)@xmath97 to obtain diagnostic ratios for shocks , as explained by @xcite . in our sample ,",
    "only two pne have log  [ ] ( @xmath16300)/h@xmath8  and log  [ ] ( @xmath16716 + 6731)/h@xmath8  close to the limit for shock fronts ( see the dashed - dotted lines in @xcite s figs . 4 through 6 ) .",
    "we conclude that only a negligible fraction of the asymmetric pne in figure 1 may have high sulphur abundance due to the presence of a shock front .",
    "the overall scientific results that we describe in the previous chapter holds even if this was the case .    in conclusion",
    ", we feel that the results shown in this paper are quite sound , in spite of the inhomogeneous abundances .",
    "this work will be extended to the smc in which the metal abundances are considerably lower than in the lmc .",
    "in addition , we are extending the ground - based spectroscopy to a far larger sample of lmc and smc pne .",
    "both the numbers of targets and the accuracy of the data will be greatly improved as a consequence .",
