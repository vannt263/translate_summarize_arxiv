    "it is now well established that the internal structure of colliding nuclei strongly influences heavy - ion collisions at energies around the coulomb barrier . in particular , the coupling to the collective excitations ( rotation and vibrational states ) in the target and projectile nuclei participating in the reaction significantly enhances the fusion cross sections for intermediate mass systems @xcite .",
    "such couplings give rise to a distribution of the coulomb barrier @xcite , which can most easily be visualized for reactions involving a deformed nucleus . in this case , the nucleus - nucleus potential depends on the orientation angle of the deformed nucleus with respect to the beam direction . since the orientation angle distributes isotropically at the initial stage of the reaction",

    "the concept of barrier distribution can be extended also to systems with a non - deformed target @xcite , where the distribution originates from the coupling between the relative motion and vibrational excitations in the colliding nuclei and/or transfer processes .",

    "this method has stimulated many high precision measurements of fusion excitation function for medium - heavy mass systems @xcite .",
    "the extracted barrier distributions have revealed that the concept indeed holds and the barrier distribution itself provides a powerful tool for investigating the effects of channel coupling on heavy - ion fusion reactions at sub - barrier energies .",
    "it has also been shown recently that the concept of barrier distribution is still valid even for relatively heavy systems , such as @xmath11mo@xmath12mo @xcite .",
    "a similar barrier distribution can also be extracted from quasi - elastic scattering ( a sum of elastic , inelastic and transfer processes ) at backward angles @xcite , that is a good counterpart of the fusion reaction @xcite . in this case , the barrier distribution is defined as the first derivative of the ratio of quasi - elastic to the rutherford cross sections @xmath13 , with respect to @xmath9 , @xmath14 @xmath15/@xmath16 . since the fusion and the quasi - elastic scattering is related to each other because of the flux conservation , a similar information can be obtained from those processes and the similarity between the two representations for barrier distribution has been shown to hold for several intermediate mass systems @xcite .",
    "recently , the quasi - elastic barrier distribution has been exploited to investigate the entrance channel dynamics for fusion reactions to synthesize super - heavy elements @xcite .",
