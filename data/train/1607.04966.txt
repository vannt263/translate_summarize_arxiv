    "outflows in most of the astrophysical objects are considered to be associated with accretion phenomena @xcite .",
    "indeed , they are generally thought to be produced from the boundary layers of the central objects , including black holes ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c96a);@xcite ) , paradoxical as it may sound . in a standard keplerian disk , where the centrifugal force is totally balanced by gravity",
    ", no boundary layer could be formed around a black hole .",
    "this is not the case when the angular momentum is ` not - keplerian ' such as when the flow is transonic which has low and almost constant angular momentum . here",
    ", the outward centrifugal force slows down the infalling matter forming a static or oscillating shock ( see , c96a and references therein ) or , even a shock free flow with a broad and diffused centrifugal barrier @xcite .",
    "the post - shock region is the so - called centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer or cenbol .",
    "it has been shown that a large region of the parameter space allows such a shock formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "when the flow has some viscosity , this parameter space starts to shrink @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when the thermal energy at the base of the jet is dissipated , the drive required to form outflows is also reduced .",
    "so , it is pertinent to ask how the outflow rate depends on both the energy dissipation and the viscosity at the base of the flow , i.e. , the cenbol .",
    "even more important is to know the upper limit of viscosity parameter , when all the flow parameters such as the specific energy and angular momentum at the inner edge of the disk are held constant , which will still allow the formation of shocks in presence of these dissipations .",
    "there are estimates of @xmath0 parameter in accretion disks both from observational and numerical simulations .",
    "if these estimates are lower as compared to our limits , it would indicate that cenbol would form and radiation emitted from it is an integral part of the spectral and timing properties of black holes .",
    "it has been shown recently ( @xcite [ ] ; see also , @xcite , with a different viscous stress prescription ) , that there is an upper limit on the @xcite viscosity parameter above which three sonic points and therefore standing shocks are not possible in a viscous accretion flow .",
    "these results were predicted by @xcite and @xcite in the context of isothemal and polytropic flows respectively where it was shown that the topology of solutions change dramatically beyond a critical value of viscosity . in paper",
    "i , the limit is shown to be @xmath4 .",
    "in presence of dissipation at the shock and mass outflow , this limit is likely to change . in the present paper",
    ", we address this very important issue and show that indeed , shock dissipation tightens the limit to @xmath5 .",
    "if , furthermore , outflows are included , then one requires to have @xmath6 for shock formation .",
    "this reduces the available parameter space even further .",
    "nevertheless , as we show below , this limit is not low enough to prohibit formation of the shocks since even the estimated viscosities in flows from observations are much lower than this value .",
    "thus the observational evidences of shocks which decide on the spectral properties of black holes and shock oscillations in explaining quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) remain valid even when outflows from dissipative shocks are present .    in the next section ,",
    "we present the model equations used for our study . in  3 , we present procedures to solve for the transonic flows properties , including the shock locations . in  4 ,",
    "we discuss how the parameter space , spanned by the specific energy at the inner sonic point and the specific angular momentum on the black hole horizon behave in presence of viscosity , energy dissipation and outflow rate . in  5 , we show a similar analysis for the data from outbursts of different black hole candidates . finally , in  6",
    ", we draw our conclusions .",
    "we begin with the governing equations as presented in c96a by considering a stationary , axisymmetric flow in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium around a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath7 .",
    "this is the so - called 1.5 dimensional hybrid model flow ( chakrabarti , 1989 ; hereafter c89 ) .",
    "the spacetime geometry around the black hole is described by pseudo - newtonian potential first introduced by @xcite .",
    "units of distance and speed are chosen to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the speed of light respectively . here",

    "the local variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 in above equations are the radial velocity , density , isotropic pressure , keplerian angular momentum and specific angular momentum of the flow respectively . also , @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the polytropic index : @xmath20 .",

    "the flow originates at the companion surface with negligible radial velocity and gains speed , becoming supersonic after passing through the outer sonic point .",
    "it then makes a discontinuous jump to the subsonic branch at a point where shock conditions are fulfilled and passes through the inner sonic point before entering into the black hole supersonically .",

    "we compute shock locations following the above procedure , also described in paper i. we follow the standard method for calculating the shock conditions ( c89 , c96a , @xcite ) .",

    "we concentrate only on solutions with standing shock waves .    ;",
    "( b ) @xmath77 ; @xmath82 . ]      in numerical simulations of @xcite and later in @xcite , it was shown that outflows are produced from the post - shock region and matter is ejected in between the centrifugal barrier and the funnel wall of thick advective flow .",

    "also shown is the energy lost @xmath91 through inverse comptonization , for example . ]    in @xcite , this outflow region was used to obtain a complete theoretical solution from the accretion to outflow . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "outflow rates have been computed and it was found that depending on the stength of the standing shock , a significant amount of matter may be ejected from cenbol as outflows . it is to be noted that a completely new set of one - dimensional equations governing the energy and mass accretion rate conservation along the z - axis are needed to carry out the outflow properties , since our hybrid model accretion flow ( 1.5 dimensional ) is not capable of handling the outflow velocity variation .    in recent numerical simulations which include radiative transfer ,",
    "it was also found that the cenbol is responsible for the outflows , and the outflow rate starts to decrease with increasing keplerian disk rate as the cenbol is cooled down by inverse comptonization @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we assume that the cenbol is the origin of the entire outflow .",
    "we assume that the outflow has an angular momentum same as that at the launching radius .",
    "as discussed above , we assume that the boundaries of the outflow are decided by the @xmath83 and @xmath84 surfaces as were observed in numerical experiments mentioned above .",
    "this provides us with an instantaneous cross - sectional area of the flow which is required to compute the velocity profile from which the outflow rate is obtained ( das & chakrabarti , 1999 ) .",
    "we consider the outflow to be polytropic in nature and the energy and mass conservation equations are written as @xcite :    @xmath92    @xmath93    where the variables pertaining to the outflow contain an ` o ' as the subscript . here ,    @xmath94    @xmath95,%eq 10b\\ ] ]    where @xmath88 , @xmath87 and @xmath89 stand for the radius of the centrifugal barrier ( @xmath84 ) , radius of the funnel wall ( @xmath96 ) and the area enclosed between these surfaces respectively , see fig .",
    "2 . at the centrifugal barrier , the centrifugal force balances gravity @xcite . at the funnel wall ,",
    "total effective pressure vanishes .",
    "so we can write ,    @xmath97    @xmath98    as a result , we get the expressions    fig @xmath99^{1/4 } ~~\\mathrm{and}\\\\%eq 12a\\ ] ] @xmath100    using equations 9(a - b ) we calculate locations of sonic points by standard way as explained earlier .",
    "we obtain the equation , @xmath101 where , @xmath102 following a similar method as earlier , equating @xmath103 with zero , we get the value of mach no . at the sonic point and equating @xmath104 with zero , we get the value of sound speed at the sonic point . here",
    ", we use @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the value of angular momentum of the inflow at the shock location .",
    "subsequently , the ratio , @xmath107 can be calculated using the formula , @xmath108 finally , the ratio of the outflow rate to inflow rate is calculated with the formula , @xmath109    following the procedure used in the absence of the outflow , we find shock locations as flow parameters are varied .",
    "to be concrete , we chose @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath1 and @xmath112 and obtained the available parameter space having non - zero value of @xmath113 as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( a - d ) .",
    "the highest values of @xmath113 are 0.13,0.1,0.08 and 0.08 when f=0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 .",
    "the curves are drawn for @xmath0 in the same sequence as those in fig .",
    "1(a ) . from right , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "it is clear that when outflows are included , the parameter space shrinks significantly as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig .",
    "3(b ) when @xmath70 was chosen . in fig .",
    "3(c ) , results of @xmath77 are shown . in fig .",
    "3(d ) , for @xmath116 , the parameter space shrinks even further . when @xmath117 , the parameter space of interest is vanished altogether .",
    "this shows that when cooling is enhanced , the outflows are choked , supporting the findings of numerical simulations of @xcite that softer states would not have stronger jets ( unless there are other effects , such as , magnetic tension which affects the cenbol dynamically and sporadic and powerful , often superluminal , jets are produced ) .",
    "we also find that the maximum @xmath0 called @xmath72 for which shocks are possible is monotonically decreasing .",
    "; @xmath118 , ( b ) for @xmath70 ; @xmath119 , ( c ) f=0.2 ; @xmath120 , ( d ) f=0.3 ; @xmath121 . ]",
    "it may be instructive to see how the ratio of outflow rate and inflow rate , namely , @xmath122 changes with specific angular momentum in the cenbol .",
    "this is because , in numerical simulations of @xcite it was pointed out that this outflow is primarily centrifugal force driven .",
    "if true , @xmath122 generally must have a rising trend with @xmath54 .",
    "this is also verified from our theoretical work as presented in fig .",
    "4 . as before",
    ", the curves are drawn for various @xmath0 from right to left curve : @xmath123 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "4(a ) that the outflow rate decreases gradually as @xmath0 increases and finally vanishes when @xmath124 , when @xmath125 . furthermore , rates are higher when the @xmath54 is also high . from fig .",
    "4(b ) , we observe that only stronger shocks survive when @xmath0 is increased .",
    "most interestingly , as already shown for inviscid flows in @xcite and @xcite , the highest outflow rate is not necessarily seen when the shock is of highest strength .",
    "a balance of the cenbol size and the energy available at the shock plays a major role in deciding this interesting behaviour .     at constant energy , @xmath126 , @xmath70 for various specific angular momenta with @xmath127 .",

    "( d ) behavior of shock strength for the same parameters as in ( c ) . ]    accordingly , if the base of the jet is more energetic ( hot ) , the outflow rate is expected to be high , even if the shock strength is not the highest . in fig .",
    "4(c - d ) , we see this behaviour . in fig .",
    "4(c ) , we plot @xmath128 as a function of @xmath71 for various energy dissipation factor @xmath69 ; @xmath129 throughout .",
    "the more dissipation the shock has , lesser is the outflow rate and the shock strength .",
    "these results are very important to link spectral states with outflows .",
    "we clearly see that for the spectrally softer states ( low temperature of the cenbol ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ct95 ) ) the outflow rate is lower .",
    "though the incoming transonic flow and the outflow have positive energies , it is not necessary that the energy of matter entering into the black hole is positive .",
    "this is because the matter may dissipate significant amount of energy due to cooling processes ( by inverse comptonization , for example ) , and eventually the flow becomes bound .",
    "the outflow would still be possible with positive energy .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "thus , during the rising phase of the outburst , viscosity parameter has evolved from a smaller value in the quiescent state to at least @xmath165 when the soft state is reached . during the peak of the soft state",
    ", the value of the viscosity parameter could have gone much higher than this . however , turning the source of higher viscosity ( e.g. , magnetic field entangling inside the disk ) off would reduce the matter supply in the keplerian component and would initiate the declining phase of the outburst .",

    "thus the viscosity parameter reaches higher than the critical value in the keplerian disc component and lower than the critical value in the advective component in order to form shocks .",
    "if we follow the same procedure to the outburst of maxij1659 - 152 , we find that though its orbital time is only 2.414 hrs , the time duration in which the peak of disk rate followed halo rate was @xmath167 7 days @xcite . in the rising state of the outburst , @xmath65 moves from @xmath168 to @xmath169 before the soft intermediate state is achieved .",
    "low frequency qpos were observed in the range of @xmath170 to @xmath171 . following an analysis similar to the previous case",
    ", we find that for maxij1659 - 152 , @xmath172 would be enough to cause the formation of the soft state . here",
    "the advective component can have @xmath111 as the highest value of the viscosity parameter .",
    "thus the tcaf scenario remains consistent .",
    "@xcite reported that time duration between the peaks of disk rate and halo rate during 2011 outburst of maxij1836 - 194 was @xmath173 days . here",
    ", the orbital period is 4.8 hrs .",
    "it was observed that @xmath65 changed in the range of @xmath174 in the duration of the outburst .",
    "low frequency qpos were observed in the range @xmath175 during the rising phase of the outburst . using the same procedure",
    ", we find that the keplerian component could be formed and the soft intermediate state is reached for this source for @xmath176 .",
    "of course , @xmath0 could be larger when even softer state is reached . in this case also , the advective component viscosity parameter ( @xmath156 ) is much lower , which is consistent .",
    "it is intriguing that the matter can indeed resist strong gravitational pull of a black hole if its angular momentum does not redistribute fast enough to create a keplerian disc . under this circumstance ,",
    "matter forms a centrifugal pressure dominated boundary layer from where hot matter may also escape outward driven by the centrifugal force .",
    "this feature has been explored by several authors @xcite . with the rise of viscosity parameter , formation of the centrifugal barrier",
    "becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "one thus requires an answer to the most relevant question in the subject of accretion disc : is viscosity generated inside the disc sufficient to redistribute low angular momentum matter into a keplerian disc , i.e. , maintain a keplerian distribution in the first place ? if not , then one would have a flow with a centrifugal barrier and a shock so that the hot post - shock region ( cenbol ) acts as the compton cloud and produces the observed power - law component as envisaged by ct95 .",
    "if a keplerian disk is formed at least on the equatorial region due to viscosity higher than a critical value ( ct95 ) its rate would decide if the cenbol would remain hot .",
    "most importantly , if cenbol forms , so does the outflow .",
    "higher rate in the keplerian component would cool the cenbol down and produces a spectrally soft state inhibiting the outflow @xcite .    in the present paper , using theoretical approach , we answered many questions .",
    "we used the appropriate set of equations governing the flow and then modified the rankine - hugoniot condition assuming a viscous dissipative flow having both energy and mass loss .",
    "in paper i , energy loss and outflows from cenbol were not included . in the present paper",
    "we include these after combining the description of the outflow , and formalism of dissipation as present in the literature @xcite . in @xcite @xmath177",
    "was chosen to be continuous which triggers a jump in the angular momentum at the shock , while we use a continuity in angular momentum since we are discussing axisymmetric shocks .",
    "this difference induces major changes in the rankine - hugoniot conditions , though , some of their conclusions remain similar to those present in our work . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "shocks move outward with increasing @xmath0 as in our present paper where we kept the conditions on the horizon and inner sonic points fixed .",
    "major conclusions of our work are the followings :    1 .",
    "\\i ) centrifugal pressure supported standing shocks continue to form even when energy dissipation at the shock and outflows are included .",
    "\\ii ) the parameter space shrinks more than what was shown in paper - i in presence of loss of mass and energy at the centrifugal barrier .",
    "\\iii ) the upper limit of viscosity parameter @xmath72 is reduced to @xmath178 and @xmath179 respectively when only energy dissipation is included and when both the energy dissipation and outflows are included .",
    "this upper limit of @xmath0 was about @xmath112 when neither dissipation and nor outflows are included ( paper i ) .",
    "this implies that the parameter space with standing shocks is reduced .",
    "\\iv ) the outflow rate increases with lower viscosity and with higher specific angular momentum of the flow .",
    "this directly shows that the outflow is centrifugally driven .",
    "\\v ) the ratio of the outflow rate to inflow rate need not be maximum for the strongest possible shocks , a result which was first presented in chakrabarti ( 1999 ) using a simplified spherical flow geometry .",
    "\\vi ) as the dissipation at the base of the outflow , namely cenbol , is increased , the outflow is reduced .",
    "this agrees with detailed numerical simulation results of garain et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that spectrally softer states produce lesser outflows .",
    "\\vii ) analysis of real data of several black hole candidates show that indeed our theoretical result is very stringent . in real flow ,",
    "viscosity parameters required when the shocks are found to be formed appear to be well within our limits .",
    "furthermore , we compute viscosity parameters in outbursting sources from the time lag of soft x - rays and found that the required viscosity in the keplerian component is indeed higher than the critical value . in the advective component , the viscosity is less than the limiting value required for shock formation .    in the literature , there are observations and numerical simulations of magnetized disks which show that the viscosity parameter in a realistic flow can not be too high .",
    "the models relying on magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) for the transport of angular momentum @xcite have produced reliable results in simulating magnetized disks .",
    "such numerical simulations show that a value of @xmath180 is achieved by such process .",
    "if values of @xmath0 greater than this are to be achieved , a net vertical magnetic flux condition has to be imposed @xcite .",
    "smak ( 1999 ) reported that appropriate value of @xmath0 in the hot , ionized state during dwarf - novae - oubtursts was @xmath145 in the keplerian disk . but",
    "taking the measured time intervals between outbursts into account , @xcite suggested the value of @xmath0 in the cool state to be in the order of @xmath181 .",
    "@xcite indicated @xmath182 in the keplerian component .",
    "it is found that most mri simulations find the effective value of @xmath0 to be of the order of @xmath135 while the values calculated from observations are of the order @xmath111 @xcite . since the viscosity of a keplerian disk has to be above the critical value in order to achieve the distribution within the infall time ,",
    "such a result is expected .    combining these results in conjuction with the constraints on viscosity parameter obtained above",
    ", we find that centrifugal barriers and shocks are allowed in a realistic flow even with certain amount of energy dissipation ( through inverse comptonization , for instance ) and mass loss ( outflows ) .",
    "were the upper limit of @xmath0 parameter too low , in view of numerical results stated above , the shocks would not have been formed and the advective flow component would have just behaved as a dynamic corona without a strong centrifugal barrier .",
    "however , satisfactory fitting of observational data with tcaf @xcite indicates that the behaviour of cenbol remained predictable and is indeed an important component of the emission process .",
    "thus the viscosity in the flow can not be too high @xcite to obliterate it , especially in harder states .",
    "in presence of magnetic fields threading the cenbol , the outflow rate would be enhanced removing some angular momentum .",
    "though there is to date no consistent solution which suggests the presence of long range poloidal fields in a turbulent disks we consider , even a small amount of field may affect the dynamics of the flow .",
    "so , it would be instructive to study the effects of the fields on the general conclusions we draw here .",
    "this will be reported in near future .",
