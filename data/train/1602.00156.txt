    "an outstanding problem in nuclear physics is to study the properties of atomic nuclei based on realistic interactions among the protons and neutrons .",
    "the rapid development of @xmath2 @xmath3 methods for solving finite nuclei provides a theoretical foundation that can be numerically solved to high precision using realistic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) and three - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interactions .",
    "a number of meson - exchange potentials , sometimes combined with phenomenological terms to achieve high accuracy in fitting @xmath5 data ( cd - bonn @xcite , nijmegen @xcite , argonne @xcite ) , have been developed that should be used together with modern @xmath6 forces ( urbana @xcite@xcite , illinois @xcite , tucson - melbourne @xcite@xcite@xcite ) to describe properties of many - body nuclear systems .",
    "a very important step in the theory of inter - nucleon interactions is the emergence of realistic @xmath5 and @xmath6 interactions tied to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) via chiral perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "+ in addition , recent advances in the utilization of high - performance computing systems offer an opportunity for @xmath2 @xmath3 approaches to be at the forefront of nuclear structure explorations .",
    "various microscopic many - body methods have been developed for no - core treatments of nuclei , including no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite@xcite@xcite , the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) approach @xcite@xcite@xcite , the coupled - cluster ( cc ) method @xcite@xcite , etc .",
    "the name ncsm is due to the fact that all the nucleons of the nucleus are active and treated on an equal footing and thus no inert core is assumed .",
    "the ncsm method was introduced as a finite matrix truncation of the infinite matrix problem with a renormalized hamiltonian specific to that truncation .",
    "+ here we adopt the @xmath2 @xmath3 no - core full configuration ( ncfc ) approach @xcite@xcite@xcite which is an extension of the ncsm approach . in the ncfc approach ,",
    "the direct solution of the nuclear many - body problem is obtained by diagonalization in a sufficiently large basis space that converged binding energies are obtained - either directly or by simple extrapolation . + we select a traditional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis so there are two basis space parameters , the ho energy @xmath7 and the many - body basis space cutoff @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath8 is defined as the maximum number of total oscillator quanta allowed in the many - body basis space above the minimum for that nucleus .",
    "we obtain convergence in this two - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath9 ) , where convergence is defined as independence of both parameters within estimated uncertainties .",
    "+ in the present work , we investigate the properties of @xmath0li and @xmath0be in the @xmath2 @xmath3 ncfc approach with the jisp16 @xcite@xcite@xcite and chiral nnlo@xmath1 @xcite interactions .",
    "the jisp16 @xmath5 interaction , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is constructed in the j - matrix inverse scattering approach @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is known to provide an excellent description of @xmath10 scattering data with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the interaction was fitted in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of phase - equivalent transformations to a few binding energies of nuclei with @xmath12 , and it provides a good description of bindings and spectra of light nuclei without referring to three - nucleon forces @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . + chiral effective field theory ( eft ) is a promising theoretical approach to obtain a quantitative description of the nuclear force from first principles @xcite .",
    "interactions from chiral eft employ symmetries and the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking of qcd @xcite@xcite .",
    "moreover , the interaction is parametrized in terms of low - energy constants ( lecs ) that are determined by fitting experimental data .",
    "our adopted nnlo@xmath1 interaction at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) is constructed by the optimization tool pounders ( practical optimization using no derivatives for squares ) in the phase - shift analysis @xcite@xcite .",
    "the optimization of the low - energy constants in the @xmath5 sector at nnlo yields a @xmath13/datum of about one for laboratory scattering energies below 125 mev .",
    "the nnlo@xmath1 @xmath5 interaction is also fitted to provide very good agreement with binding energies and radii for a = 3 and 4 nuclei .",
    "some key aspects of nuclear structure , such as excitation spectra , the position of the neutron drip line in oxygen , shell - closures in calcium , and the neutron matter equation of state at subsaturation densities , are reproduced by the nnlo@xmath1 interaction without the addition of three - nucleon forces .",
    "we give a brief review of the ncfc method and , for more details , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "the hamiltonian for the a - body system in relative coordinates is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the two - nucleon ( coulomb ) interaction .",
    "our expression for @xmath16 is somewhat schematic since the @xmath5 interaction may , in general , be non - local .",
    "furthermore , in the present work , we neglect @xmath6 interactions .",
    "we solve the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath17 with numerical techniques formulated within a basis expansion ( configuration interaction ) approach . in the ncfc ,",
    "the wave function @xmath18 is a superposition of slater determinants @xmath19 of single - particle ho states .",
    "@xmath20 + for practical calculations , a finite basis space is specified by the @xmath8 truncation .",
    "we aim for results that are convergent as determined by their independence of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "we present results for even values of @xmath8 that correspond to states with the same parity as the lowest ho configuration ( the @xmath21 configuration ) and are called the `` natural '' parity states .",
    "+ we also need to address the issue of center of mass ( com ) motion . in the above discussion",
    ", the hamiltonian is in the relative coordinate and not in the single - particle coordinates where the ho states are specified .",
    "the methods of solution , including the method to constrain the com motion , are not described in this paper , because these details have been explained in refs .",
    "we obtain our results with the mfdn code , a hybrid mpi / openmp configuration interaction code for @xmath2 @xmath3 nuclear structure calculations @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "+ the properties of @xmath0li with jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 and @xmath0be with jisp16 are given in the next section .",
    "results for @xmath0li with jisp16 up to and including the @xmath22 truncation are in agreement with those in ref .",
    "the values of @xmath0li with the nnlo@xmath1 interaction , as well as the @xmath23li results with jisp16 at @xmath24 , are reported here for the first time .",
    "the properties we present for @xmath0be , the mirror nuclei of @xmath0li , are more extensive than those presented in the related references . in order to assess convergence , we present results for even values of the parameter @xmath8 from 8 to 16 , and for @xmath7 over a range from 10 mev to 40 mev .",
    "the ground state energy is one of the primary observables in nuclear physics .",
    "our results for the ground state energies of @xmath0li with jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 , and of @xmath0be with jisp16 , are plotted in fig . 1 as a function of the ho energy at our selected values of @xmath8 .",
    "with increasing @xmath8 , the minima of the u - shaped curves are closer to each other and the shapes exhibit reduced dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "1 that the energies with jisp16 are lower than those with nnlo@xmath1 for @xmath0li at each value of @xmath8 . moreover ,",
    "the ground state energies from the jisp16 interaction for both @xmath0li and @xmath0be show better convergence patterns than that from nnlo@xmath1 .",
    "the lowest minima ( points closest to convergence ) in the three panels are near @xmath25 mev .",
    "we also indicate the first breakup thresholds in fig . 1 ( @xmath26+@xmath27 for @xmath0li and @xmath28+@xmath27 for @xmath0be ) .",
    "note that we use the experimental energies for the thresholds since both jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 give very accurate binding energies for nuclei with @xmath29 .",
    "the energies with jisp16 in panel 1 and panel 3 are lower than these thresholds .",
    "the energy with nnlo@xmath1 is very close to the threshold where it appears near the tangent of the @xmath24 u - shaped line .",
    "we will next see that , upon extrapolation , the ground state energies of all cases in fig .",
    "1 lie below the lowest thresholds .",
    "+ we now discuss how we extrapolate the results obtained in finite basis spaces to the infinite basis space and produce an extrapolation uncertainty . to obtain the extrapolated ground state energy @xmath30 , we use the exponential form@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , @xmath31 we follow the method described as `` extrapolation b '' in ref . @xcite . under the assumption that the convergence is exponential , we use three successive value of @xmath8 at each value of @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical uncertainty is the difference between the extrapolated results from two consecutive sets of @xmath8 values .",
    "the extrapolated results using the highest available set of @xmath8 values ( 12 , 14 and 16 ) and their numerical uncertainties ( depicted as error bars ) are shown in fig .",
    "these numerical uncertainties due to extrapolations , also defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , are minimal and the extrapolations nearly independent of ho energy near @xmath32 mev for jisp16 and near 25 mev for nnlo@xmath1 indicating favorable convergence estimates at those values of the ho energy .",
    "+            we present the energies of the four lowest excited states as a function of the ho energy with a series of @xmath8 values in fig . 2 and compare with the experimental excitation energies .",
    "the y - axis denotes the excitation relative to the ground state at the same ho energy and @xmath8 value . in general , many of the results show reasonable convergence in the @xmath7 range of 15 - 25 mev where the ground state energies are close to their minima . with increasing @xmath7 ,",
    "the jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 interactions produce similar @xmath7-dependence patterns for @xmath0be and @xmath0li .",
    "+ we now focus on the upper two excited states which have the same total angular momentum @xmath33 . in the left and right panels ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath23li and @xmath23be respectively with jisp16 , the two states are nearly degenerate .",
    "however , with the nnlo@xmath1 interaction for @xmath23li ( central panel ) , there is about a 1 mev larger energy gap between the two states .",
    "in addition , both the @xmath33 curves for nnlo@xmath1 increase monotonically with increasing @xmath7 while the corresponding jisp16 curves display peaks and dips in the lower @xmath7 range which become less pronounced with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "these non - monotonic features in the case of jisp16 may be attributed , at least in part , to the mixing of these two states as we discuss below .",
    "+        let us now turn our attention to observables other than the energies .",
    "the calculated point proton root - mean - square ( rms ) radii are presented for the ground states of @xmath0li and @xmath0be as a function of ho energy for a range of @xmath8 values in fig .",
    "we first note that these rms radii are approximately independent of @xmath8 near @xmath34 mev .",
    "this feature of the rms radii , sometimes referred to as defining the `` interaction '' or `` crossover '' point , has been noted in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite and is sometimes taken as the estimate of the converged rms radius .",
    "we adopt the practice of quoting the crossover point of the rms radii in the current work since the robust extrapolations of rms radii will require additional developments and/or larger basis spaces .",
    "similarly , for other observables quoted below , we cite only an estimate based on a visual inspection of the convergence pattern without an associated uncertainty . over time",
    ", we anticipate that further theoretical developments will provide reliable extrapolation tools that yield refined converged estimates from our results . + with increasing @xmath7 , the patterns of the rms radii are similar for @xmath0be and @xmath0li for the two different interactions .",
    "the radii of @xmath0li and @xmath0be decrease monotonically with increasing @xmath7 and show a weak trend towards convergence as is frequently found for this long - range observable calculated in a ho basis .",
    "the value of the rms radius is a little larger with nnlo@xmath1 than that with jisp16 for @xmath0li at the same @xmath7 and @xmath8 values , which may simply be a reflection of the lower binding energy of nnlo@xmath1 relative to jisp16 .",
    "+ the magnetic dipole moments in units of @xmath35 are depicted in fig .",
    "4 as a function of the ho energy for @xmath0li and @xmath0be with the jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 interactions .",
    "it is easy to see that the magnetic dipole moment for @xmath0be is negative and those for @xmath0li are about @xmath36 with the two different interactions . with increasing @xmath8 ,",
    "the magnetic moments tend to decrease slightly in magnitude but converge to within about 1 - 2@xmath37 .",
    "the converged value of @xmath0be appears to be a little below @xmath38 .",
    "the converged magnetic dipole moment of @xmath0li with nnlo@xmath1 is close to @xmath39 while the result with jisp16 is a little less than @xmath40 .",
    "+ our results for the ground state quadrupole moments , another important electromagnetic observable , are shown in fig .",
    "the patterns for the quadrupole moment results reflect the patterns seen above for the rms radii since they are closely related observables . in particular , we again observe a very weak convergence pattern with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "one may visually estimate that the converged results will be in the region of -3.5 @xmath41 for @xmath23li and -5.5 @xmath41 for @xmath23be .",
    "+ next , we present the results of two b(e2 ) transitions to the ground state ( @xmath42 ) in fig .",
    "6 where the transition from the @xmath43 state is represented by the top three panels and from the @xmath44 state by the bottom three panels .",
    "the left panels and the middle panels are for @xmath0li with jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 respectively .",
    "the right panels are for @xmath0be with jisp16 .",
    "as may be expected , the patterns of these b(e2 ) transitions are also similar to those of point proton rms radii in fig .",
    "we again observe a very weak tendency for convergence reflecting the major role of the radius operator in the b(e2 ) .",
    "comparing both @xmath43 and @xmath45 @xmath46 ground state ( signified by `` g.s . '' in the label ) b(e2 ) transitions for @xmath0li ( with either the jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 interactions ) , the results for the latter transition are about half those of the former transition .",
    "this pattern persists in the @xmath0be transitions also seen in fig .",
    "3 . + the excitation energies , quadrupole moments and b(e2 ) s that we have presented and discussed for @xmath0be are key observables that play a critical role in the identification and characterization of its yrast rotational band @xcite .",
    "indeed , their systematics along with the systematics of the other members of the same band obtained in ncfc calculations with jisp16 are essential to demonstrating emergence of collective rotational motion in @xmath0be .",
    "we present three b(m1 ) transitions as a function of the ho energy in fig .",
    "7 for @xmath0li and @xmath0be with a sequence of @xmath8 values .",
    "the three top graphs display the b(m1 ) transitions from the @xmath43 state to the @xmath42 ground state .",
    "the three middle graphs and the three bottom graphs are from the @xmath47 state and the @xmath48 state to the ground state , respectively .",
    "the subscript @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) on the @xmath51 signifies the lower ( upper ) of the two states with @xmath52 . + it is noteworthy that the top three graphs have the same convergence pattern for @xmath0li and @xmath0be with the jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 interactions .",
    "considering the greatly expanded scales used for these b(m1 ) results , one observes that good convergence is actually attained in all cases shown in fig .",
    "in particular the convergence at the highest @xmath8 shown is good over a fairly large range in @xmath7 from about 15 mev to about 35 mev .",
    "these b(m1 ) s as well as the magnetic dipole moments continue to be among the best converged of the electromagnetic observables in ncfc calculations .",
    "+ features suggestive of the mixing of the two @xmath51 states , which were discussed above in connection with the behaviors of the excitation energies , are also apparent in the b(m1 ) transitions of fig .",
    "the low and the high @xmath7 regions of the @xmath23li transitions from these @xmath51 states with the jisp16 interaction , for example , appear to support the discussions of mixing that were stimulated by the results for the excitation energies . this mixing is again seen to decrease with increasing @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , one may now interpret the results for the b(m1)s from the two @xmath51 states in @xmath23be as suggesting mixing that also decreases with increasing @xmath53 .    in order to better examine the nuclear structure and the relationship between the different states , we present the total magnetic moment and the contributions to the total angular momentum from the orbital motions of the proton and neutron as well as the contributions from intrinsic spin in fig . 8 .",
    "we follow the procedures presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and define these contributions though matrix elements of the projections of these individual contributions on the state s total angular momentum , i.e. by matrix elements of the terms on the right - hand side of the following equation : + @xmath54 from top to bottom , the three graphs are for @xmath0li with jisp16 , @xmath0li with nnlo@xmath1 and @xmath0be with jisp16 respectively .",
    "one may compare the top panel in fig .",
    "8 for @xmath0li with jisp16 to corresponding results in ref .",
    "@xcite where the results were shown through @xmath22 . from the left to the right in each panel , the individual frames are for the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 successively . in the frames for the first three states",
    ", we see that the four components are well converged as they become nearly independent of the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "+ in the two panels with the jisp16 interaction results in fig .",
    "8 , the two states with @xmath33 exhibit trends suggesting there is crossing and mixing as a function of @xmath7 at lower values of @xmath57 .",
    "we have elected to display a larger range of results in fig . 8 for these two states than presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to map out this level crossing as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "clearly with increasing @xmath8 , the level crossing as a function of @xmath7 is disappearing in the @xmath7 range of 10 to 40 mev .",
    "+ we also include the magnetic moment in fig . 8 for each state ( purple symbols and lines ) which is a sum over the weighted contributions from the other results depicted .",
    "thus , the magnetic moment shows a similar convergence pattern to those of its individual contributions .",
    "+ let us examine the results for the @xmath58 state in fig . 8 in some detail",
    ". in all cases , the intrinsic spin ( green ) provides almost no contribution to the total angular momentum . for @xmath23li the neutron orbital motion ( blue )",
    "dominates while for @xmath23be the proton orbital motion ( red ) dominates as may be expected on the basis of isopsin symmetry ( an approximate symmetry since we include coulomb and nnlo@xmath1 is charge - dependent ) . due to the relative weightings of these contributions",
    ", the magnetic moment shows an apparent slower trend towards convergence .",
    "for example , if we take the case of @xmath23li with nnlo@xmath1 , we see that the @xmath58 state has a negative contribution from the neutron intrinsic spin that , due to the large weighting of the neutron intrinsic magnetic moment , provides a slower convergence pattern than observed for the @xmath59 and @xmath60 states .",
    "the source of this weaker convergence is the weaker convergence of the neutron spin contribution ( green ) in the @xmath58 state compared to its contribution in the two lower - lying states - though it may be challenging to see this detail in the central frame of the middle panel in fig .",
    "+ finally , the properties of @xmath0li with the jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 interactions and @xmath0be with jisp16 are listed in table.1 .",
    "the results are compared to the experimental values as well as those from av18+il7@xcite@xcite and chiral nn+nnn@xcite . for @xmath0li ,",
    "the results with different interactions are listed in columns 2 - 6 , and those for @xmath0be are in columns 7 - 9 . in the present work ,",
    "we do not quote the uncertainty which has been explained and discussed in related references . however , the uncertainties estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite remain as valid estimates for our current uncertainties ( see , for example , the extrapolation uncertainties depicted in fig .",
    "1 ) so that we can assert the following : the theoretical results with jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 interaction are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results . nevertheless , the results with av18+il7 appear to be more consistent with experiment .",
    "the values in the fourth column for nnlo@xmath1 show somewhat larger differences with experiment than those with jisp16 and av18+il7 possibly due , primarily , to slower convergence of observables in @xmath23li with this interaction .",
    "we have calculated the properties of @xmath0li and @xmath0be with the jisp16 and nnlo@xmath1 interactions in the no - core full configuration ( ncfc ) approach .",
    "we present results with the many - body truncation parameter @xmath8 up through 16 and for natural parity ( @xmath8 is even ) .",
    "we obtained the energies of the ground and excited states , point proton rms radii , magnetic and quadrupole moments , e2 and m1 transitions .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first time that properties of @xmath0li with nnlo@xmath1 are presented .",
    "the theoretical results and experimental data are compared in table . 1 .",
    "taking into consideration the attained degree of convergence , we find the results with jisp16 or av18+il7 are in better agreement with the experimental data than those with nnlo@xmath1 . in order to aid in the diagnostics of individual states and to better understand the generally good convergence of magnetic moments , we decompose the magnetic moment contributions into proton and neutron orbital and spin components .",
    "this aids us , for example , to observe level crossing in the @xmath61 states found with the jisp16 interaction in both @xmath23li and @xmath23be .",
    "interestingly , we did not observe this level crossing in @xmath23li with nnlo@xmath1 .",
