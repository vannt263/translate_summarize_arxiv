    "in the @xmath0 bilayer quantum hall ( qh ) state , when both layers have the same electron density and sufficiently close together , interlayer coulomb interactions can produce a many - body state even in the absence of interlayer tunneling @xcite .",
    "this collective state is thought to have a broken symmetry , which is viewed as an easy - plane ferromagnet in the pseudospin space .",
    "pseudospin `` up '' ( `` down '' ) refers to an electron in the `` front '' ( `` back '' ) layer .",
    "the huge tunneling conductance observed in this collective state is considered as the goldstone mode of this broken symmetry .",
    "intriguingly , this collective state has a remarkable tilting angular dependence reported by murphy _",
    "@xcite , which is characterized as a rapid decrease of energy gap before crossing over into a roughly angular independent region .",
    "this dependence is explained as a commensurate - incommensurate ( cic ) transition @xcite , a change in pseudospin ferromagnetic properties of the ground state .",
    "the lowest - energy charged excitation has been considered as a pair of pseudospin vortices called meron @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the monolayer @xmath0 state is also a broken symmetry ferromagnetic ground state . in this case",
    ", the spontaneous ferromagnetic order is in the spin space , which leads to the system possessing an unusual spin excitation known as skyrmion @xcite .",
    "the energy gap increases with tilting because the zeeman energy , @xmath1 , is increased @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 is the gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the bohr magneton and @xmath5 is the total magnetic field .",
    "however , except for those two extremes , the bilayer @xmath0 state has scarcely been investigated so far .",
    "it is interesting how the energy gap changes as the density difference is made between the two layers .    in this paper ,",
    "we report on the tilting angular dependence of the activation energy in @xmath0 bilayer qh states , especially when the electron densities in the front layer @xmath6 and in the back layer @xmath7 are different .",
    "our earlier experiment has already revealed a consecutive existance of the @xmath0 bilayer qh state from the bilayer balanced density state to the monolayer limit @xcite , but comprehensive experiments are yet to be performed . representing the normalized density difference as @xmath8",
    ", the energy gap shows a strong @xmath9-dependent behavior and the overall change exhibits a continuous transformation from @xmath10 to 1 .",
    "in addition , we measured the energy gap of the @xmath0 bilayer @xmath10 state in a sample with considerably large tunneling gap .",
    "samples used in this experiment are gaas / al@xmath11 + ga@xmath12as double - quantum - well heterostructures grown by molcular beam epitaxy .",
    "we used mainly two samples ; they both have two 20 nm wide gaas wells separated by a 3.1 nm al@xmath11ga@xmath12as barrier layer .",
    "their tunneling gap @xmath13 are 1k ( @xmath14 ) and 11k ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we additionally prepared a sample with extremely large tunneling gap .",
    "having the barrier layer thickness of 1 nm and the al concentration of 0.33 , the tunneling gap of this sample is 33 k. a unique feature of these sample structures is that the modulation doping is carried out only on the front side of the double quantum well , and electrons in the other side of the layer is fully field - induced by applying a positive bias to an underlying @xmath16 -gaas back gate .",
    "this method enables us to control the electron density without deteriorating the mobility @xcite .",
    "the low temperature mobility of all samples is @xmath17@xmath18/vs , except for @xmath19k sample @xmath20@xmath18/vs at electron density @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "measurements were performed with the sample mounted in a mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "standard low - frequency ac lock - in techniques were used with a current of 20na to avoid heating effects .",
    "a goniometer with a superconducting stepper motor was used to rotate the samples in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the activation energy gap @xmath23 was determined from the temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance @xmath24 .",
    "the angular dependence of the activation energy ( a ) for @xmath25k and ( b ) for @xmath26k .",
    "it looks like that the behavior at @xmath10 transforms into that at @xmath27 continuously in both samples .",
    "the solid thin curves are guides to the eye . ]    in fig .",
    "[ graph_d - q ] , we show the angular dependence of the activation energy at various density differences ( a ) for @xmath28k and ( b ) for 1k . here",
    "@xmath29 is the tilting angle of the magnetic field from the normal line of the sample .",
    "the total density ( @xmath30 ) is fixed to 0.6 @xmath31 @xmath22 . in both samples ,",
    "the activation energy behavior at @xmath10 is substantially the same as the result of murphy _ et al .",
    "the gaps drop until they reach the cic transition angle @xmath32 , and then go into a roughly angle - independent regime .",
    "the transition angle @xmath32 is 43@xmath33 for 11k sample and 27@xmath33 for 1k sample . at the monolayer point ,",
    "the gaps indicate a typical skyrmion - like behavior .",
    "the number of flipped spins is approximately 7 , according to the method employed by schmeller _",
    "_ @xcite . yet",
    "the most remarkable results of this measurement is that the energy gaps transform continuously from the balanced point to the monolayer limit .",
    "it seems that there is no clear transition from meron - pair excitations to skyrmion excitations .",
    "furthermore , the changes at @xmath34 and 0.7 in the sample of @xmath28k are somewhat unexpected and yet more noteworthy .",
    "they drop before the cic transition angle , which is not different from @xmath10 , then they start increasing with further tilting",
    ". the numbers of flipped spins in the region of starting to increase are 2.4 at @xmath34 and 2.5 at @xmath35 , indicating a possible excitation of skyrmions .    , for @xmath361 , 11 and 33k sample .",
    "the gap is diminished with tilting and the phase transition ( indicated by the arrow ) is observed .",
    "the solid lines are guides to the eye . ]",
    "the energy gap of the sample with a large tunneling gap exhibited in fig .",
    "[ d - q_s=0 ] is very intriguing .",
    "we expected an increasing behavior because the zeeman gap @xmath37 ( @xmath38k ) is much smaller than the tunneling gap @xmath13 ( @xmath39k ) , which affects pseudospins as a ` pseudomagnetic field ' @xcite in the one - particle state .",
    "however , the observed angular dependence at the balance point decreases by tilting and shows the characteristic change of the meron - pair excitation .",
    "our experimental result is well reproduced by the following equation [ fig.[fit_d - q ] ] @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the activation energy at density difference @xmath9 and tilting angle @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are polynomial fit to the data at @xmath10 and 1 , respectively , while @xmath44 is a phenomenological bias term .",
    "values of @xmath44 are described in the figure . here",
    "we show the result of the @xmath25k sample only , but we have obtained substantially the same fitting result for the @xmath26k sample .      equation ( [ fitting ] ) indicates two essential points .",
    "first , the excitation gap of the meron - pair and that of the skyrmion are proportional to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "second , a quasiparticle must have the properties of both the meron - pair and the skyrmion at an intermediate value of @xmath9 .",
    "we argue the dependence of the excitation gap on @xmath9 by studying how the spin and pseudospin stiffnesses depend on it . by increasing @xmath9 from zero ,",
    "the effects of the intralayer coulomb interaction becomes larger in the state dominated by the interlayer coulomb exchange interactions .",
    "being accompanied by this coulomb interactions , the spin stiffness @xmath48 , for being originated in the exchange energy between the spins , increases as @xmath47 because the exchange energy is proportional to the probability of the adjacent electron existance .",
    "in contrast , the meron - pair excitation gap becomes smaller since the interlayer coulomb interaction decreases with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "the pseudospin stiffness @xmath49 is calculated within the hartree - fock approximation as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the interlayer exchange stiffness when the layers are balanced@xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9-dependence of the skyrmion excitation gap and the meron - pair excitation gap are expected to be proportional to @xmath47 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we also have to consider the enhancement of the direct coulomb energy concomitant with the excitation .",
    "this could be the origin of the term @xmath44 in equation ( [ fitting ] ) . to suppress this coulomb energy enhancement at the minimum , both spins and pseudospins",
    "must be excited simultaneously .",
    "indeed , our experimental result shows that , in imbalanced density states at @xmath0 , the charged excitation carries both the spin and pseudospin components .",
    "the reason reads as follows .",
    "let us assume either the meron - pair or the skyrmion is excited .",
    "if a level crossing occurs as the sample is tilted , we can argue that it occurs only as in fig.[typicalcrossing ] . in this case , a naive expectation is that skyrmions and meron - pairs are excited for @xmath52 and @xmath53 with a certain critical value @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "then the activation energy must be realized along the solid line in the figure . on the contrary",
    ", our experimental result is against a simple level crossing between a skyrmion and a meron - pair excitations .",
    "thus , to realize the experimental curve , it is necessary that there exists a single excitation carrying both spins and pseudospins which is reduced to the skyrmion in the monolayer limit ( @xmath27 ) and to the meron - pair at the balanced point ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "such a simultaneous flip of spins and pseudospins may be the predicted su(4 ) skyrmion in the @xmath0 bilayer qh state @xcite .",
    "finally , the present experiment suggests that pseudospins are excited at @xmath10 even in a sample with very large tunneling gap [ fig .",
    "[ d - q_s=0 ] ] . an intriguing behavior of this activation energy as a function of the tilting angle in fig .",
    "[ d - q_s=0 ] is yet to be explained .    in conclusion",
    ", we measured the tilting angular dependence of the energy gap by changing the density difference in the @xmath0 bilayer qh state .",
    "we have found a simultaneous excitation of spins and pseudospins in imbalanced density states .",
