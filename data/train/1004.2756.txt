    "the following evolutionary equation for the metric @xmath2 @xmath3 has been recently introduced by kong and liu @xcite and named as _ hyperbolic geometric flow _ , where @xmath4 stands for the ricci curvature tensor of @xmath2 . for the study on the hyperbolic geometric flow",
    ", we refer to the recent papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of a riemannian metric @xmath2 on a riemann surface @xmath5 under the flow ( [ 1.1 ] ) . on a surface , the hyperbolic geometric flow equation ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "simplifies , because all of the information about curvature is contained in the scalar curvature function @xmath6 in our notation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gauss curvature .",
    "the ricci curvature is given by @xmath9 and the hyperbolic geometric flow equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) simplifies the following equation for the special metric @xmath10 the metric for a surface can always be written ( at least locally ) in the following form @xmath11 where @xmath12 therefore , we have @xmath13 thus the equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) becomes @xmath14 namely , @xmath15 denote @xmath16 then the wave equation ( [ 1.6 ] ) reduces to @xmath17 ( [ 1.8 ] ) is a quasilinear hyperbolic wave equation . the global existence and the life - span of classical solutions to the cauchy problem for hyperbolic equations with the initial data with compact support",
    "have been studied by many authors ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) . however",
    ", only a few results have been known for the case of the initial data with non - compact support , which plays an important role in both mathematics and physics .",
    "recently , kong , liu and xu @xcite studies the evolution of a riemannian metric @xmath2 on a cylinder @xmath18 under the hyperbolic geometric flow ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "they prove that , for any given initial metric on @xmath19 in a class of cylinder metrics , one can always choose suitable initial velocity symmetric tensor such that the solution exists for all time , and the scalar curvature corresponding to the solution metric @xmath2 keeps uniformly bounded for all time ; moreover , if the initial velocity tensor is suitably ",
    "large \" , then the solution metric @xmath2 converges to the flat metric at an algebraic rate .",
    "if the initial velocity tensor does not satisfy the condition , then the solution blows up at a finite time , and the scalar curvature @xmath20 goes to positive infinity as @xmath21 tends to the blowup points , and a flow with surgery has to be considered .",
    "this result shows that , by comparing to ricci flow , the hyperbolic geometric flow has the following advantage : the surgery technique may be replaced by choosing suitable initial velocity tensor .",
    "some geometric properties of hyperbolic geometric flow on general open and closed riemann surfaces are also discussed ( see kong et al @xcite ) .    in this paper , we consider the cauchy problem for ( [ 1.8 ] ) with the following initial data @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a suitably small parameter , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two smooth functions of @xmath26 and satisfy that there exist two positive constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 such that @xmath29 ( [ 1.10 ] ) implies that the initial data satisfies the slow decay property , that is , the initial riemann surface are asymptotic flat .",
    "we shall prove the following theorem .",

    "then there exist two positive constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that for any fixed @xmath33 $ ] , the cauchy problem ( [ 1.8])-([1.9 ] ) has a unique @xmath34 solution on the interval @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 is given by @xmath37    as we know , the flow equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) is a system of fully nonlinear partial differential equations of second order , it is very difficult to study the global existence or blow - up of the classical solutions of ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "an interesting and important question is to investigate the evolution of asymptotic flat initial riemann surfaces under the flow ( [ 1.1 ] ) . in this case , although the equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) can simply reduce to ( [ 1.8 ] ) , ( [ 1.8 ] ) is still a fully nonlinear wave equation , only a few results have been known even for its cauchy problem . our main result , theorem 1.1 , gives a lower bound on the life - span of the classical solution of the cauchy problem ( [ 1.8])-([1.9 ] ) .",
    "this theorem shows that the smooth evolution of asymptotic flat initial riemann surfaces under the flow ( [ 1.1 ] ) exists at least on the interval @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we establish some new estimates on the solutions of linear wave equations in two space variables , these estimates play an important role in the proof of theorem 1.1 . based on this , we prove theorem 1.1 in section 3 , which gives a lower bound of the life - span of classical solutions to the hyperbolic geometric flow with asymptotic flat initial riemann surfaces .",
