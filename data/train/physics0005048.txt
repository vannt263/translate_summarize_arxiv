    "branching networks are an important category of all networks with river networks being a paradigmatic example . probably as much as any other natural phenomena , river networks are a rich source of scaling laws  @xcite .",
    "central quantities such as drainage basin area and stream lengths are reported to closely obey power - law statistics  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this scaling has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms including , among others : principles of optimality  @xcite , self - organized criticality  @xcite , invasion percolation  @xcite , and random fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties in establishing any theory is that the reported values of scaling exponents show some variation  @xcite .    with this variation in mind ,",
    "we have in  @xcite extensively examined hack s law , the scaling relationship between basin shape and stream length .",
    "such scaling laws are inherently broad - brushed in their descriptive content . in an effort to further improve comparisons between theory and data and , more importantly , between networks themselves , we consider here a generalization of horton s laws  @xcite .",
    "defined fully in the following section , horton s laws describe how average values of network parameters change with a certain discrete renormalization of the network . the introduction of these laws by horton may be seen as one of many examples that presaged the theory of fractal geometry  @xcite .",
    "in essence , they express the relative frequency and size of network components such as stream segments and drainage basins .    here , we extend horton s laws to functional relationships between probability distributions rather than simply average values .",
    "the recent work of peckham and gupta was the first to address this natural generalization of horton s laws  @xcite .",
    "our work agrees with their findings but goes further to characterize the distributions and develop theoretical links between the distributions of several different parameters .",
    "we also present empirical studies that reveal underlying scaling functions with a focus on fluctuations and further consider deviations due to finite - size effects .",
    "we examine continent - scale networks : the mississippi , amazon , congo , nile and kansas river basins . as in  @xcite",
    ", we also examine scheidegger s model of directed , random networks  @xcite . both real and model networks provide important tests and motivations for our generalizations of horton s laws .",
    "we begin with definitions of stream ordering and horton s laws .",
    "thereafter , the paper is divided into two main sections . in section  [ sec : horton.postform ] , we first sketch the theoretical generalization of horton s laws . estimates of the horton ratios are carried out in section  [ sec : horton.hortonratios ] and these provide basic parameters of the generalized laws . empirical evidence from real continent - scale networks",
    "is then provided along with data from scheidegger s random network model in section  [ sec : horton.generalization ] . in section  [ sec : horton.moments ] we derive the higher order moments for stream length distributions and in section  [ sec : horton.devs ] , we consider deviations from horton s laws for large basins . in the appendix",
    "[ sec : horton.theory ] , we expand on some of the connections outlined in section  [ sec : horton.generalization ] , presenting a number of mathematical considerations on these generalized horton distributions .    this paper is the second in a series of three on the geometry of river networks . in the first  @xcite",
    "we address issues of scaling and universality and provide further motivation for our general investigation . in the third article of the series  @xcite we extend the work of the present paper by examining how the detailed architecture of river networks , i.e. , how network components fit together .",
    "stream ordering was first introduced by horton in an effort to quantify the features of river networks  @xcite .",
    "the method was later improved by strahler to give the present technique of horton - strahler stream ordering  @xcite .",
    "stream ordering is a method applicable to any field where branching , hierarchical networks are important . indeed ,",
    "much use of stream ordering has been made outside of the context of river networks , a good example being the study of venous and arterial blood networks in biology  @xcite .",
    "we describe two conceptions of the method and then discuss empirical laws defined with in the context of stream ordering .",
    "a network s constituent stream segments are ordered by an iterative pruning .",
    "an example of stream ordering for the mississippi basin is shown in figure  [ fig : horton.order_paths_mispi10 ] .",
    "a source stream is defined as a section of stream that runs from a channel head to a junction with another stream ( for an arboreal analogy , think of the leaves of a tree ) .",
    "these source streams are classified as the first order stream segments of the network .",
    "next , remove these source streams and identify the new source streams of the remaining network .",
    "these are the second order stream segments .",
    "the process is repeated until one stream segment is left of order @xmath0 .",
    "the order of the network is then defined to be @xmath0 .",
    "once stream ordering on a network has been done , a number of natural quantities arise .",
    "these include @xmath1 , the number of basins ( or equivalently stream segments ) for a given order @xmath2 ; @xmath3 , the average main stream length ; @xmath4 , the average stream segment length ; @xmath5 , the average basin area ; and the variation in these numbers from order to order .",
    "horton  @xcite and later schumm  @xcite observed that the following ratios are generally independent of order @xmath2 : @xmath6 since the main stream length averages @xmath7 are combinations of stream segment lengths @xmath8 we have that the horton ratio for stream segment lengths @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath10 . because our theory will start with the distributions of @xmath11 , we will generally use the ratio @xmath9 in place of @xmath10 .",
    "horton s laws have remained something of a mystery in geomorphology  the study of earth surface processes and form  due to their apparent robustness and hence perceived lack of physical ( or geological ) content .",
    "however , statements that horton s laws are `` statistically inevitable ''  @xcite , while possibly true , have not yet been based on reasonable assumptions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many other scaling laws can be shown to follow in part from horton s laws  @xcite .",
    "thus , horton s laws being without content would imply the same is true for those scaling laws that follow from them .",
    "other sufficient assumptions include uniform drainage density ( i.e. , networks are space - filling ) and self - affinity of single channels .",
    "the latter can be expressed as the relation  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the longitudinal diameter of a basin .",
    "scaling relations may be derived and the set of relevant scaling exponents can be reduced to just two : @xmath14 as given above and the ratio @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "note that one obtains @xmath16 so that only the two horton ratios @xmath17 and @xmath9 are independent .",
    "horton ratios are thus of central importance in the full theory of scaling for river networks .",
    "horton s laws relate quantities which are indexed by a discrete set of numbers , namely the stream orders .",
    "they also algebraically relate mean quantities such as @xmath18 .",
    "hence we may consider a generalization to functional relationships between probability distributions .",
    "in other words , for stream lengths and drainage areas we can explore the relationships between probability distributions defined for each order .    furthermore , as we have noted , horton s laws can be used to derive power laws of continuous variables such as the probability distributions of drainage area @xmath19 and main stream length @xmath20  @xcite : @xmath21 these derivations necessarily only give discrete points of power laws .",
    "in other words , the derivations give points as functions of the discrete stream order @xmath2 and are uniformly spaced logarithmically and we interpolate the power law from there . the distributions for stream lengths and areas must therefore have structures that when combined across orders produce smooth power laws .",
    "for the example of the stream segment length @xmath22 , horton s laws state that the mean @xmath23 grows by a factor of @xmath9 with each integer step in order @xmath2 . in considering @xmath24 , the underlying probability distribution function for @xmath22 , we postulate that horton s laws apply for every moment of the distribution and not just the mean .",
    "this generalization of horton s laws may be encapsulated in a statement about the distribution @xmath24 as @xmath25 the factor of @xmath26 indicates the that @xmath27 , i.e. , the frequency of stream segments of order @xmath2 decays according to horton s law of stream number given in equation  ( [ eq : horton.hortonratios ] ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we write @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 where constants @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are appropriate normalizations .",
    "we have used the subscripted versions of the lengths and areas , @xmath22 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , to reinforce that these parameters are for points at the outlets of order @xmath2 basins only .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is the number of streams of order @xmath2 within a basin of order @xmath38 .",
    "this will help with some notational issues later on .",
    "the form of the distribution functions @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 and their interrelationships become the focus of our investigations . since scaling is inherent in each of these postulated generalizations of horton s laws , we will often refer to these distribution functions as _ scaling functions_.    we further postulate that distributions of stream segment lengths are best approximated by exponential distributions .",
    "empirical evidence for this will be provided later on in section  [ sec : horton.generalization ] .",
    "the normalized scaling function @xmath43 of equation  ( [ eq : horton.ellwfreq ] ) then has the form @xmath44 where we have introduced a new length scale @xmath45 and stated its appearance with the notation @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is potentially network dependent .",
    "as we will show , distributions of main stream lengths , areas and stream number are all dependent on @xmath45 and this is the only additional parameter necessary for their description . note that @xmath45 is both the mean and standard deviation of @xmath46 , i.e. , for exponential distributions , fluctuations of a variable are on the order of its mean value .",
    "we may therefore think of @xmath45 as a _ fluctuation length scale_. note that the presence of exponential distributions indicates a randomness in the physical distribution of streams themselves and this is largely the topic of our third paper  @xcite .    since main stream lengths are combinations of stream segment lengths , i.e.   @xmath47 , we have that the distributions of main stream lengths of order @xmath2 basins are approximated by convolutions of the stream segment length distributions . for this step ,",
    "it is more appropriate to use conditional probabilities such as @xmath48 where the basin order @xmath2 is taken to be fixed .",
    "we thus write @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes convolution .",
    "details of the form obtained are given in appendix  [ subsec : horton.mainstreamdist ] .",
    "the next step takes us to the power law distribution for main stream lengths .",
    "summing over all stream orders and integrating over @xmath51 we have @xmath52 where we have returned to the joint probability for this calculation .",
    "the integral over @xmath53 is replaced by a sum when networks are considered on discrete lattices .",
    "note that the probability of finding a main stream of length @xmath20 is independent of any sort of stream ordering since it is defined on an unordered network .",
    "the details of this calculation may be found in appendix  [ subsec : horton.powerlawdists ] where it is shown that a power law @xmath54 follows from the deduced form of the @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "we now examine the usual horton s laws in order to estimate the horton ratios .",
    "these ratios are seen as intrinsic parameters in the probability distribution functions given above in equations  ( [ eq : horton.ellwfreq ] ) , ( [ eq : horton.lwfreq ] ) , ( [ eq : horton.awfreq ] ) and  ( [ eq : horton.nwfreq ] ) .    .",
    "horton ratios for the mississippi river . for each range of orders @xmath57 , estimates of the ratios are obtained via simple regression analysis . for each quantity , a mean @xmath58 , standard deviation @xmath59 and",
    "normalized deviation @xmath60 are calculated .",
    "all ranges with @xmath61 are used in these estimates but not all are shown the values obtained for @xmath10 are especially robust while some variation is observed for the estimates of @xmath17 and @xmath62 .",
    "good agreement is observed between the ratios @xmath17 and @xmath62 and also between @xmath10 and @xmath9 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure  [ fig : horton.nalomega_mispi10](a ) shows the stream order averages of @xmath11 , @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath63 for the mississippi basin .",
    "deviations from exponential trends of horton s laws are evident and indicated by deviations from straight lines on the semi - logarithmic axis .",
    "such deviations are to be expected for the smallest and largest orders within a basin  @xcite . for the smallest orders , the scale of the grid used becomes an issue but even with infinite resolution , the scaling of lengths , areas and number for low orders can not all hold at the same time  @xcite . for large orders ,",
    "the decrease in sample space contributes to these fluctuations since the number of samples of order @xmath2 streams decays exponentially with order as @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , correlations with overall basin shape provide another source of deviations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in our theoretical investigations below we will presume exact scaling .",
    "note also that the equivalence of @xmath17 and @xmath62 is supported by figure  [ fig : horton.nalomega_mispi10](b ) where the stream numbers @xmath65 have been inverted for comparison .",
    "similar agreement is found for the amazon and nile as shown in tables  [ tab : horton.mispi10orders ] , [ tab : horton.amazonorders ] , and  [ tab : horton.nileorders ] which we now discuss .",
    "table  [ tab : horton.mispi10orders ] shows the results of regression on the mississippi data for various ranges of stream orders for stream number , area and lengths .",
    "tables  [ tab : horton.amazonorders ] and  [ tab : horton.nileorders ] show the same results carried out for the amazon and nile .",
    "each table presents estimates of the four ratios @xmath17 , @xmath62 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "also included are the comparisons @xmath66 and @xmath67 , both of which we expect to be close to unity . for each quantity , we calculate the mean @xmath58 , standard deviation @xmath59 and normalized deviation @xmath60 .",
    "note the variation of exponents with choice of order range .",
    "this is the largest source of error in the calculation of the horton ratios .",
    "therefore , rather than taking a single range of stream orders for the regression , we examine a collection of ranges . also , the deviations for high and low orders observed in figures  [ fig : horton.nalomega_mispi10](a ) and  [ fig : horton.nalomega_mispi10](b ) do of course affect measurements of the horton ratios . in all cases",
    ", we have avoided using data for the smallest and largest orders .",
    "for the three example networks given here , the statements @xmath16 and @xmath68 are well supported .",
    "the majority of ranges give @xmath69 and @xmath67 very close to unity .",
    "the averages are also close to one and are different from unity mostly by within 1.0 and uniformly by within 1.5 standard deviations .    the normalized deviations , ie .",
    ", @xmath60 , for the four ratios are all below @xmath70 .",
    "no systematic ordering of the @xmath60 is observed .",
    "of all the data , the values for @xmath10 in the case of the mississippi are the most notably uniform having @xmath71 . throughout",
    "there is a slight trend for regression on lower orders to overestimate and on higher orders to underestimate the average ratios , while reasonable consistency is found at intermediate orders .",
    "thus , overall the ranges chosen in the tables give a reasonably even set of estimates of the horton ratios and we will use these averages as our estimates of the ratios .",
    "we now present horton distributions for the mississippi , amazon , and nile river basins as well as the scheidegger model .",
    "scheidegger networks may be thought of as collections of random - walker streams and are fully defined in  @xcite and extensively studied in  @xcite .",
    "the forms of all distributions are observed to be the same in the real data and in the model .    the first distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : horton.ellw_collapse_mispi2](a ) .",
    "this is the probability density function of @xmath72 , fourth order stream segment lengths , for the mississippi river .",
    "distributions for different orders can be rescaled to show satisfactory agreement .",
    "this is done using the postulated horton distribution of stream segment lengths given in equation  ( [ eq : horton.ellwfreq ] ) .",
    "the rescaling is shown in figure  [ fig : horton.ellw_collapse_mispi2](b ) and is for orders @xmath73 .",
    "note the effect of the exponential decrease in number of samples with order is evident for @xmath74 since @xmath75 is considerably scattered .",
    "nevertheless , the figure shows the form of these distributions to be most closely approximated by exponentials .",
    "we observe similar exponential distributions for the amazon , the nile and the scheidegger model .",
    "the fluctuation length scale @xmath45 is found to be approximately @xmath76 meters for the mississippi , @xmath77 meters for the amazon and @xmath78 meters for the nile .    since @xmath45 is based on the definition of stream ordering , comparisons of @xmath45 are only sensible for networks that are measured on topographies with the same resolution .",
    "the above values of @xmath45 are approximate and our confidence in them would be improved with higher resolution data .",
    "nevertheless they do suggest that fluctuations in network structure increase as we move from the mississippi through to the nile and then the amazon .",
    "the distributions of @xmath79 main stream lengths for the amazon river is shown in figure  [ fig : horton.lw_collapse_amazon2](a ) .",
    "since main stream lengths are sums of stream segment lengths , their distribution has a single peak away from the origin .",
    "however , these distributions will not tend towards a gaussian because the individual stream length distributions do not satisfy the requirements of the central limit theorem  @xcite .",
    "this is because the moments of the stream segment length distributions grow exponentially with stream order .",
    "as the semi - logarithmic axes indicate , the tail may be reasonably well ( but not exactly ) modeled by exponentials .",
    "there is some variation in the distribution tails from region to region .",
    "for example , corresponding distributions for the mississippi data do exhibit tails that are closer to exponentials .",
    "however , for the present work where we are attempting to characterize the basic forms of the horton distributions , we consider these deviations to be of a higher order nature and belonging to the realm of further research .    in accord with equation  ( [ eq : horton.lwfreq ] ) , figure  [ fig : horton.lw_collapse_amazon2](b ) shows the rescaling of the main stream length distributions for @xmath73 .",
    "the ratios used , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are taken from table  [ tab : horton.amazonorders ] .",
    "given the scatter of the distributions , it is unreasonable to perform minimization techniques on the rescaled data itself in order to estimate @xmath17 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is best done by examining means , as we have done , and higher order moments which we discuss below .",
    "furthermore , varying @xmath17 and @xmath10 from the above values by , say , @xmath82 does not greatly distort the visual quality of the `` data collapse . ''",
    "similar results for the scheidegger model are shown in figure  [ fig : horton.figsche_lengthomega ]",
    ". the scheidegger model may be thought of as a network defined on a triangular lattice where at each lattice site one of two directions is chosen as the stream path  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : horton.figsche_lengthomega](a ) gives a single example distribution for main stream lengths of order @xmath74 basins .",
    "the tail is exponential as per the real world data .",
    "figure  [ fig : horton.figsche_lengthomega](b ) shows a collapse of main stream length distributions for orders @xmath79 through @xmath83 .",
    "in contrast to the real data where an overall basin order is fixed ( @xmath0 ) , there is no maximum basin order here .",
    "the distributions in figure  [ fig : horton.figsche_lengthomega](b ) have an arbitrary normalization meaning the absolute values of the ordinate are also arbitrary . otherwise , this is the same collapse as given in equation  ( [ eq : horton.lwfreq ] ) . for the scheidegger model ,",
    "our simulations yield @xmath84 and @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "for all distributions , we observe similar functional forms for real networks and the scheidegger model , the only difference lying in parameters such as the horton ratios .",
    "figure  [ fig : horton.aw_collapse_nile2 ] shows more horton distributions , this time for drainage area as calculated for the nile river basin . in figure  [ fig : horton.aw_collapse_nile2 ] , an example distribution for @xmath79 sub - basins is presented .",
    "the distribution is similar in form to those of main stream lengths of figure  [ fig : horton.lw_collapse_amazon2 ] , again showing a reasonably clear exponential tail .",
    "rescaled drainage area distributions for @xmath73 are presented in figure  [ fig : horton.aw_collapse_nile2](b ) .",
    "the rescaling now follows equation  ( [ eq : horton.awfreq ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath17 and @xmath62 were not equivalent , the rescaling would be of the form @xmath86 since we have asserted that @xmath87 , equation  ( [ eq : horton.awfreq2 ] ) reduces to equation  ( [ eq : horton.awfreq ] ) .",
    "the horton ratio used here is @xmath88 which is in good agreement with @xmath89 , the respective standard deviations being @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "both figures are taken from the data of table  [ tab : horton.nileorders ] .      as stated in section  [ sec : horton.postform ] , the horton distributions of @xmath29 and @xmath28 must combine to form power law distributions for @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see equations  [ eq : horton.pa ] and [ eq : horton.l - lom ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lw_powerlawsum2_mispi ] provides empirical support for this observation for the example main stream lengths of the mississippi network .",
    "the distributions for @xmath92 , 4 and 5 main stream lengths are individually shown .",
    "their combination together with the distribution of @xmath93 gives the reasonable approximation of a power law as shown .",
    "the area distributions combine in the same way .",
    "note that the distributions do not greatly overlap .",
    "each point of the power law is therefore the addition of significant contributions from only two or three of the separate distributions .",
    "the challenge here then is to understand how rescaled versions of @xmath40 , being the basic form of the @xmath55 , fit together in such a clean fashion .",
    "the details of this connection are established in appendix  [ subsec : horton.powerlawdists ] .      in considering the generalized horton distributions for number and area ,",
    "we observe two main points : a calculation in the vein of what we are able to do for main stream lengths is difficult ; and , the horton distributions for area and number are equivalent .    in principle , horton area distributions may be derived from stream segment length distributions .",
    "this follows from an assumption of statistically uniform drainage density which means that the typical drainage area drained per unit length of any stream is invariant in space .",
    "apart from the possibility of changing with space which we will preclude by assumption , drainage density does naturally fluctuate as well  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath94 where the sum is over all orders and all stream segments and @xmath95 is the average drainage density .",
    "however , we need to know for an example basin , how many instances of each stream segment occur as a function of order .",
    "for example , the number of first order streams in an order @xmath38 basins is @xmath96 .",
    "given the distribution of this number , we can then calculate the distribution of the total contribution of drainage area due to first order streams .",
    "but the distributions of @xmath30 are not independent so we can not proceed in this direction .",
    "we could potentially use the typical number of order @xmath2 streams , @xmath64 .",
    "then the distribution of total area drained due to order @xmath2 streams would approach gaussian because the individual distribution are identical and the central limit theorem would apply . however , because the fluctuations in total number of stream segments are so great , we lose too much information with this approach .",
    "indeed , the distribution of area drained by order @xmath2 stream segments in a basin reflects variations in their number rather than length .",
    "again , we meet up with the problem of the numbers of distinct orders of stream segment lengths being dependent",
    ".    one final way would be to use tokunaga s law  @xcite .",
    "tokunaga s law states that the number of order @xmath97 side branches along an ( absorbing ) stream segment of order @xmath58 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "the parameter @xmath100 is the average number of side streams having order @xmath101 for every order @xmath58 absorbing stream .",
    "this gives a picture of how a network fits together and may be seen to be equivalent to horton s laws  @xcite .",
    "now , even though we also understand the distributions underlying tokunaga s law  @xcite , similar technical problems arise . on descending into a network , we find the number of stream segments at each level to be dependent on all of the above",
    ".    nevertheless , we can understand the relationship between the distributions for area and number .",
    "what follows is a generalization of the finding that @xmath87 .",
    "the postulated forms for these distributions were given in equations  ( [ eq : horton.awfreq ] ) and  ( [ eq : horton.nwfreq ] ) .",
    "consider @xmath96 , the number of first order streams in an order @xmath38 basin .",
    "assuming that , on average , first order streams are distributed evenly throughout a network , then this number is simply proportional to @xmath102 .",
    "as an example , figure  [ fig : horton.figsche_number_area ] shows data obtained for the scheidegger model . for the scheidegger model ,",
    "first order streams are initiated with a @xmath103 probability when the flow at the two upstream sites is randomly directed away , each with probability @xmath104 .",
    "thus , for an area @xmath102 , we expect and find @xmath105 .",
    "for higher internal orders , we can apply a simple renormalization .",
    "assuming a system with exact scaling , the number of streams @xmath30 is statistically equivalent to @xmath106 .",
    "since the latter is proportional to @xmath107 we have that @xmath108 where the constant of proportionality is the density of order @xmath2 streams , clearly , this equivalence improves as number increases , i.e. , the difference @xmath109 increases .",
    "while we do not have exact forms for the area or number distributions , we note that they are similar to the main stream length distributions .",
    "since source streams are linear basins with the width of a grid cell , the distribution of @xmath110 is the same as the distribution of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , a pure exponential .",
    "hence , @xmath113 is also an exponential . for increasing @xmath2 ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath29 becomes single peaked with an exponential tail , qualitatively the same as the main stream length distributions .",
    "finally , we discuss the higher order moments for the generalized horton distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : horton.figmoments_l_mispi ] presents moments for distributions of main stream lengths for the case of the mississippi .",
    "these moments are calculated directly from the main stream length distributions .",
    "a regular logarithmic spacing is apparent in moments for orders ranging from @xmath114 to @xmath83 .    to see whether or not this is expected , we detail a few small calculations concerning moments starting from the exponential form of stream segment lengths given in equation  ( [ eq : horton.elldist ] ) . as noted previously , for an exponential distribution , @xmath115 ,",
    "the mean is simply @xmath116 . in general , the @xmath117th moment of an exponential distribution is @xmath118 assuming scaling holds exactly for across all orders , the above is precisely @xmath119 . note that @xmath120 . since the characteristic length of order @xmath2 streams is @xmath121 , we therefore have @xmath122    since main stream lengths are sums of stream segment lengths , so are their respective moments .",
    "hence , @xmath123 we can now determine the log - space separation of moments of main stream length .",
    "using stirling s approximation  @xcite that @xmath124 we have @xmath125 + c,\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is a constant .",
    "the @xmath127 term inside the square brackets in equation  [ eq : horton.logsp_mom ] creates small deviations from linearity for @xmath128 .",
    "thus , in agreement with figure  [ fig : horton.figmoments_l_mispi ] , we expect approximately linear growth of moments in log - space .",
    "in this last section , we briefly examine deviations from scaling within this generalized picture of horton s laws . the basic question is given an approximate scaling for quantities measured at intermediate stream orders , what can we say about the features of the overall basin ?    as noted in the previous section , all moments of the generalized horton distributions grow exponentially with order . coupling this with the fact that @xmath129 , i.e. , the number of samples of order @xmath2 basins decreases exponentially with @xmath2",
    ", we observe that a basin s @xmath19 and @xmath20 will potentially differ greatly from values predicted by horton s laws .    to illustrate this , figure  [ fig : horton.lw_blownup_congo ] specifically shows the distributions @xmath130 and @xmath131 scaled up to give @xmath132 for the congo river .",
    "the actual congo s length measured at this 1000 meter resolution is represented by the solid line and is around 57% of the distribution s mean as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "nevertheless , we see that the measured length is within a standard deviation of the predicted value .    in table",
    "[ tab : horton.maxlvariation ] , we provide a comparison of predicted versus measured main stream lengths and areas for the basins studied here .",
    "the mean for the scaled up distributions overestimates the actual values in all cases except for the nile .",
    "also , apart from the nile , all values are within a standard deviation of the predicted mean .",
    "the coefficients of variation , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , all indicate that fluctuations are on the order of the expected values of stream lengths and areas .",
    "thus , we see that by using a probabilistic point of view , this generalized notion of horton s laws provides a way of discerning the strength of deviations about the expected mean . in general",
    ", stronger deviations would imply that geologic conditions play a more significant role in setting the structure of the network .",
    "the objective of this work has been to explore the underlying distributions of river network quantities defined with stream ordering .",
    "we have shown that functional relationships generalize all cases of horton s laws .",
    "we have identified the basic forms of the distributions for stream segment lengths ( exponential ) and main stream lengths ( convolutions of exponentials ) and shown a link between number and area distributions .",
    "data from the continent - scale networks of the mississippi , amazon , and nile river basins as well as from scheidegger s model of directed random networks provide both agreement with and inspiration for the generalizations of horton s laws .",
    "finally , we have identified a fluctuation length scale @xmath45 which is a reinterpretation of what was previously identified as only a mean value .",
    "we see the study of the generalized horton distributions as integral to increasing our understanding of river network structure .",
    "we also suggest that practical network analysis be extended to measurements of distributions and the length scale @xmath45 with the aim of refining our ability to distinguish and compare network structure .    by taking account of fluctuations inherent in network scaling laws ,",
    "we are able to see how measuring horton s laws on low - order networks is unavoidably problematic .",
    "moreover , as we have observed , the measurement of the horton ratios is in general a delicate operation suggesting that many previous measurements are not without error .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the growth and evolution of river networks requires a more thorough approach to measurement and a concurrent improvement in the statistical description of river network geometry .",
    "the present consideration of a generalization of horton s laws is a necessary step in this process giving rise to stronger tests of both real and synthetic data . in the following paper  @xcite ,",
    "we round out this expanded picture of network structure by consdering the spatial distribution of network components .",
    "the work was supported in part by nsf grant ear-9706220 and the department of energy grant de fg02 - 99er 15004 .",
    "the authors would like to express their gratitude to h.  cheng for enlightening and enabling discussions .",
    "in this appendix we consider a series of analytic calculations .",
    "these concern the connections between the distributions of stream segment lengths @xmath22 , ordered basin main stream lengths @xmath28 and main stream lengths @xmath20 .",
    "we will idealize the problem in places , assuming perfect scaling and infinite networks while making an occasional salubrious approximation .",
    "also , we will treat the problem of lengths fully noting that derivations of distributions for areas follow similar but more complicated lines .",
    "we begin by rescaling the form of stream segment length distributions @xmath135 the normalization @xmath136 stems from the requirement that @xmath137 which is made purely for aesthetic purposes . as we have suggested in equation  ( [ eq : horton.elldist ] ) and demonstrated empirical support for , @xmath43 is well approximated by the exponential distribution @xmath138 . for low @xmath53 and also we have noted that deviations do of course occur but they are sufficiently insubstantial as to be negligible for a first order treatment of the problem .",
    "we now derive a form for the distribution of main stream lengths @xmath139 .",
    "as we have discussed , since @xmath47 , we have the convolution  ( [ eq : horton.l - ellconv ] ) .",
    "the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : horton.l - ellconv ] ) consists of exponentials as per equation  ( [ eq : horton.elldist ] ) so we now consider the function @xmath140 given by @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "we are specifically interested in the case when no two of the @xmath143 are equal , i.e. , @xmath144 for all @xmath145 . to compute this @xmath2-fold convolution",
    ", we simply examine the @xmath140 for @xmath146 and @xmath92 and identify the emerging pattern .",
    "for @xmath147 we have , omitting the prefactors for the time being , @xmath148 providing @xmath149 .",
    "convolving this with @xmath150 we obtain @xmath151        note that we have added in a factor of @xmath155 for the appropriate normalization .",
    "in addition , one observes that @xmath156 for all @xmath157 since all convolutions of pairs of exponentials vanish at the origin .",
    "furthermore , the tail of the distribution is dominated by the exponential corresponding to the largest stream segment .",
    "the next step is to connect to the power law distribution of main stream lengths , @xmath158 ( see figure  [ fig : lw_powerlawsum2_mispi ] and the accompanying discussion ) . on considering equation  ( [ eq : horton.l - lom ] )",
    "we see that the problem can possibly be addressed with some form of asymptotic analysis .    before attacking this calculation however",
    ", we will simplify the notation keeping only the important details of the @xmath55 .",
    "our main interest is to see how equation  ( [ eq : horton.l - lom ] ) gives rise to a power law .",
    "we transform the outcome of equation  ( [ eq : horton.pl_om , omdist ] ) by using @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , neglecting multiplicative constants and then summing over stream orders to obtain @xmath163 the integration over @xmath28 has been omitted meaning that the result will be a power law with one power lower than expected .",
    "we now show that this sum of exponentials @xmath164 in equation  ( [ eq : horton.nexpconvgeomratio2 ] ) does in fact asymptotically tend to a power law .",
    "we first interchange the order of summation replacing @xmath165 with @xmath166 to give @xmath167 we thus simply have a sum of exponentials to contend with .",
    "the coefficients @xmath168 appear unwieldy at first but do yield a simple expression after some algebra which we now perform : @xmath169 in reaching the last line we have shifted the indices in several places . in the last bracketed term we have set @xmath170 and then @xmath171 while in the first bracketed term , we have used @xmath172 .",
    "immediately of note is that the last term is independent of @xmath173 and may thus be ignored .",
    "the first bracketed term does depend on @xmath173 but converges rapidly .",
    "writing @xmath174 we have that @xmath175 . taking @xmath176 to be fixed and large enough such that @xmath177 is approximated well by @xmath178 for @xmath179 , we then have @xmath180 as @xmath181 , @xmath182 clearly approaches a product of @xmath183 and a constant .",
    "therefore , the first bracketed term in equation  ( [ eq : horton.ci ] ) may also be neglected in an asymptotic analysis .",
    "hence , as @xmath184 , the coefficients @xmath168 are simply given by @xmath185 and we can approximate @xmath164 as , boldly using the equality sign , @xmath186 where @xmath187 comprises the constant part of the @xmath168 and factors picked up by shifting the lower limit of the index @xmath173 from @xmath188 to @xmath189 .",
    "we have also used here the identification @xmath190 we turn now to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath191 , this being the final stretch of our analysis    there are several directions one may take at this point .",
    "we will proceed by employing a transformation of @xmath191 that is sometimes referred to as the sommerfeld - watson transformation and also as watson s lemma  @xcite .",
    "given a sum over any set of integers @xmath192 , say @xmath193 , it can be written as the following integral @xmath194 where @xmath126 is a contour that contains the points on the real axis @xmath195 where @xmath196 and none of the points of the same form with @xmath197 .",
    "calculation of the residues of the simple poles of the integrand return us to the original sum .",
    "we first make a change of variables , @xmath199 . substituting this and @xmath200 into equation  ( [ eq : horton.s(u)-transform ] )",
    "we have @xmath201 the transformed contour @xmath202 is depicted in figure  [ fig : horton.contour - swtf2 ] .    as @xmath203 ,",
    "the contribution to integral from the neighborhood of @xmath204 dominates .",
    "the introduction of the sin and cos terms has created an interesting oscillation that has to be handled with with some care .",
    "we now deform the integration contour @xmath202 into the contour @xmath205 of figure  [ fig : horton.contour - swtf3 ] focusing on the interval along the imaginary axis @xmath206 $ ] .",
    "choosing this path will simplify the cos and sin expressions which at present have logs in their arguments .",
    "the integral @xmath191 is now given by @xmath207 where @xmath208 writing @xmath209 with @xmath210 , we have @xmath211 and the following for the cos and sin terms : @xmath212 and @xmath213 the @xmath214 term in the integrand becomes @xmath215 where @xmath216 .",
    "the integral @xmath217 now becomes @xmath218 now , since @xmath219 ( taking @xmath220 ) , we can expand the expression as follows @xmath221 the integral in turn becomes @xmath222    the basic @xmath63-th integral in this expansion is @xmath223 substituting @xmath224 and replacing the upper limit @xmath225 with @xmath226 we have @xmath227 here , we have rotated the contour along the imaginary @xmath228-axis to the real @xmath229-axis and identified the integral with the gamma function @xmath230  @xcite .",
    "the integral can now be expressed as @xmath231.\\ ] ] we now need to show that the higher order terms are negligible . note that their magnitudes do no vanish with increasing @xmath53 but instead are highly oscillatory terms . using the asymptotic form of the gamma function  @xcite @xmath232 we can estimate as follows for large @xmath63 that @xmath233 hence , @xmath234 vanishes exponentially with @xmath63 .",
    "for the first few values of @xmath63 taking @xmath235 and @xmath236 , we have @xmath237 and @xmath238 showing that these corrections are negligible .    hence we are able estimate @xmath191 to first order as @xmath239 thus we have determined that a power law follows from the initial assumption that stream segment lengths follow exponential distributions .",
    "this equivalence has been drawn as an asymptotic one , albeit one where convergences have been shown to be rapid .",
    "the calculation is clearly not the entire picture as the solution does contain small rapidly - oscillating corrections that do not vanish with increasing argument . a possible remaining problem and one for further investigation is to understand how the distributions for main stream lengths @xmath28 fit together over a range that is not to be considered asymptotic .",
    "nevertheless , the preceding is one attempt at demonstrating this rather intriguing breakup of a smooth power law into a discrete family of functions built up from one fundamental scaling function ."
