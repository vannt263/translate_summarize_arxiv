    "today s picture of cosmological evolution assumes that all large scale structures we observe today developed from primordial fluctuations on top of a homogeneous and isotropic state of the early universe .",
    "these primordial fluctuations naturally arise in the context of inflation . as a consequence of the accelerated expansion ,",
    "short wavelength vacuum fluctuations are amplified as they exit the horizon scale . after the end of inflation , these fluctuations re - enter the horizon and eventually undergo gravitational collapse .",
    "depending on the total number of @xmath3-folds of inflation , the structures we observe today may originate from fluctuations with extremely small initial wavelengths as defined in the homogeneous frame .",
    "in fact , unless we fine - tune the number of @xmath3-folds , the relevant scales were all well beyond the planck scale at the onset of inflation  @xcite .",
    "inflation , therefore , effectively acts as a spacetime microscope , offering the tempting opportunity to probe very high energies by looking for signatures in the primordial perturbation spectrum  @xcite .",
    "let us denote the scale at which new physics becomes important by @xmath0 .",
    "depending on the nature of the dominant new physics ( which may or may not be of gravitational origin ) , @xmath0 might be the planck scale , the string scale , or below .",
    "demanding that the theory yields the usual results in the infrared generically gives rise to a suppression of the corrections by some power of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hubble scale at the time when the mode @xmath6 under consideration left the horizon .",
    "there are thus two ways of detecting the new physics in the perturbation spectrum .",
    "first , if the correction contains a sharply defined phase factor which is a function of @xmath4 , an oscillatory feature extending over a wide range of the power spectrum may be produced  @xcite .",
    "second , even if oscillations are absent , there is still a possibility that the largest scales we observe today correspond to sufficiently large @xmath4 that the new physics lead to a distinctive suppression or enhancement of the low-@xmath7 power spectrum at a detectable level .",
    "while we do not find effects of the first kind in our model , we conjecture that it generically predicts a large scale modification of the power spectrum .    in the absence of clear predictions from a fundamental theory ,",
    "several types of phenomenological approaches have been proposed .",
    "if lorentz invariance is retained at all energies , see e.g.  @xcite , there is no possibility to introduce deviations from the standard relativistic propagation and thus very little hope to get any signatures .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the breaking of lorentz invariance in the ultraviolet ( uv ) sector , and in fact this was done in essentially all approaches .    in the simplest of these models ,",
    "scalar or tensor perturbation modes are prescribed to be created in their adiabatic vacuum at some fixed initial time , where the initial conditions are specified either on a spacelike surface common to all modes  @xcite , or when the physical momentum @xmath8 of each mode with comoving momentum @xmath6 satisfies @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "these models predict a spectrum with superimposed oscillations whose amplitude is a power of @xmath4 which depends on the degree of non - adiabaticity of the initial state .",
    "the validity of this conclusion was questioned in  @xcite on the basis that the modulation of the corrections artificially follows from the sharp , and thus non - adiabatic , character of imposing the initial state at a given instant .    in another approach  @xcite ,",
    "lorentz invariance is broken by introducing deviations from the relativistic dispersion relation above a uv scale @xmath0 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the proper frequency and the proper momentum as measured in the preferred frame which is assumed to coincide with the cosmological frame   the description of dispersion or dissipation in empty spacetime requires to introduce a preferred frame . in condensed matter systems or in a heat bath , this frame is introduced by the medium itself . in covariant settings ,",
    "the preferred frame is defined by a vector field  @xcite .",
    "if this field is described dynamically , it aligns itself with the cosmological frame exponentially fast in inflationary backgrounds  @xcite . ] .",
    "it has been understood that the standard predictions are robust  @xcite , i.e. the modifications of the spectra scale as a power of @xmath4 , provided the initial state is the asymptotic vacuum and the modes evolve adiabatically . under these conditions ,",
    "dispersive models generically predict no superimposed oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the alternative possibility that lorentz invariance is broken by dissipative effects has received much less attention so far . to be realized while maintaining unitarity , one must introduce additional , unobservable degrees of freedom , hereafter called @xmath13 , which couple to the observable field @xmath14 in the uv sector  @xcite .",

    "one can already conclude that in cosmology , as the proper momentum @xmath8 redshifts , the modes go from a strongly dissipative regime @xmath64 for @xmath65 , to an underdamped regime where @xmath66 . using eq .",
