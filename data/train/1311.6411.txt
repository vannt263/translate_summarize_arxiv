    "the state @xmath18 was discovered in the process @xmath19 , that is generally linked to the charmonium state @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the masses could indicate that all these states are connected to the same particle observed in different processes .",
    "there are evidences , however , that the two reported states , @xmath1 and @xmath8 , could be interpreted as molecular states .",
    "the @xmath8 state has a larger product of the two - photon width times the decay branching fraction than usually expected for charmonium states , as noted in ref .",

    "we obtain the mass for this state and the decay width in the channel @xmath36 .",
    "in order to evaluate the sum rule for the @xmath1 state as a mixed @xmath37 state , with @xmath38 , one employs the following hadronic current j & = & a  j___c0  +   j__d^d^ [ mixj ] where @xmath39 is an arbitrary mixing angle . the meson and molecule currents are , respectively , given by : j___c0 & = &    j__d^d^ & = & ( |q_i _ c_i ) ( |c_j ^q_j )  .",

    "after transferring the continuum contributions to the ope side , the sum rule for the scalar charmonium - molecule , considered as a mixed scalar @xmath2 state , can be written as @xmath63 therefore , one can estimate the ground state mass from the following ratio @xmath64 where at the @xmath65-stability point , one obtains @xmath66      the numerical values for the quark masses and condensates are listed in table [ param ] .",

    "the contribution of the dimension-8 condensate is smaller than @xmath81% of the total contribution for values of @xmath82 , which indicates the starting point for a good ope convergence . in order to determine the maximum value of the borel mass parameter",

    "since the qcdsr approach extracts information only from the ground state , we have to ensure that the pole contribution is greater than the continuum contribution .",

    "<S> using the qcd sum rules approach we study the mass and decay width of the channel @xmath0 for the @xmath1 state , assuming that it can be described by a mixed charmonium - molecule scalar state @xmath2 current with @xmath3 quantum numbers . for the mixing angle @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the value @xmath5 for the mass , which is in good agreement with the experimental mass of the @xmath1 state . for the decay width into the channel @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> we find the value @xmath7 , which is also compatible with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the present description of the @xmath1 as a mixed charmonium - molecule state is a possible scenario to explain the structure of this state . </S>"
