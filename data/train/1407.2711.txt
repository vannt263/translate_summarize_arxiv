    "the good times with scaling law ended when , at the turn of this century , a polarization transfer ( pt ) experiment carried out at jlab yielded values of @xmath26 markedly different from 1 in the range of @xmath27 gev @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the polarization experiment is based on a result shown in @xcite that , again in the ope approximation , the ratio @xmath26 can be accessed in @xmath28 scattering with longitudinally polarized electron by measuring the polarizations of the recoiled proton parallel @xmath29 and perpendicular @xmath30 to the proton momentum in the scattering plane , @xmath31 polarization transfer experiment of this kind is only possible recently at jlab .",
    "it came as a big surprise that the pt experiments yield values of @xmath26 deviate substantially from 1 .",
    "it prompts intensive efforts , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the readers are referred to recent reviews @xcite for details on these developments .",
    "in addition , a comprehensive exposition of the application of the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) to the study of the two - photon exchange ( tpe ) corrections to the electron - proton scattering in the region where the kinematical variables describing the elastic ep scattering are moderately large momentum scales relative to the soft hadronic scale is presented in @xcite .    on the experimental side , a new global analysis of the world s",
    "cross section data was carried out in @xcite .",
    "it is found that the great majority of the measured cross sections were consistent with each other and the disagreement with polarization transfer measurements remains .",
    "a set of extremely high precision measurements of @xmath26 was later performed using a modified rosenbluth technique @xcite , with the detection of recoil proton to minimize the systematic uncertainties , and the discrepancy is again confirmed .",
    "the immediate step taken , on the theoretical side , was to carefully reexamine the radiative corrections which were known to be as large as @xmath32 of the uncorrected cross section in certain kinematics .",
    "of various radiative corrections , only proton - vertex and two - photon exchange ( tpe ) corrections contained @xmath25 dependence .",
    "the proton - vertex corrections had been investigated thoroughly in @xcite and found to be negligible .",
    "realistic evaluations of the tpe corrections are hence called for to see whether they can explain the discrepancy .",
    "a semi - quantittative analysis @xcite quickly established that the discrepancy can possibly be explained by a two - photon exchange correction which would not destroy the linearity of the rosenbluth plot .",

    "@xcite , dispersion approach @xcite , and pqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "they all have found that tpe effects can account for more than half of the discrepancy .",

    "the effects of tpe with @xmath34 excitation , denoted as tpe-@xmath34 hereafter , in the cross sections and the form factors have been studied in @xcite . however , there are rooms for improvement in three aspects of these calculations to arrive at a reliable estimate of the tpe-@xmath34 effects .",
    "first , as was pointed out in @xcite , the expression for the vertex function of @xmath35 used in @xcite has the incorrect sign for the coulomb quadrupole coupling , though it was not considered in @xcite .",
    "next is that the @xmath2 form factors employed in @xcite are not realistic which , as we learn in the case of tpe - n , needs to be studied .",
    "lastly , both @xcite set the coulomb quadrupole coupling to be zero , which is again not satisfactory since recent pion electroproduction experiments and the lqcd results indicate that the ratio of coulomb quadrupole ( c2 ) over magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , denote by @xmath36 grows more negative with increasing @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understandings of the discrepancy between lt and pt experiments , as well as the tpe contributions are still ongoing .",
    "it is important to have the results from various model calculations as accurate as possible so as to understand the strength and the weakness of different approaches and shed light for the further study . accordingly , we set out in this study to improve the previous calculations of the effects of tpe-@xmath34 excitation @xcite on the three aspects described in the above .",

    "taken together the encouraging results from analyzing data94 and the reasonable agreement found between our predictions for @xmath4 and the preliminary data from vepp-3 , one is tempted to say that the real part of the amplitude as prescribed from our model might not be very far from realistic , at least in the low @xmath24 region , especially if the further analyses from vepp-3 and clas will confirm our predictions .",
    "our model descriptions of the polarization data of beam - normal asymmetry @xmath86 and recoil proton polarizations @xmath29 and @xmath88 range from good to poor .",
    "the disagreement between our predictions and some of the polarization data raise intriguing challenge to our model .",
