    "<S> they are related to the internal logic paths of a complex gate . </S>",
    "<S> they are not related to any net / signal in the rtl design . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed , that when all gif on rtl are covered ( 100% ) and the same stimulus is applied , then all gate level stuck - at faults of the netlist are covered ( 100% ) as well . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed rtl atpg model is therefore synthesis independent . </S>",
