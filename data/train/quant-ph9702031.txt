    "the potential use of quantum computers for solving certain classes of problems has recently received a considerable amount of attention ( for a review see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . a major obstacle in the building of quantum computers , however , is the coupling of the computer with its environment or the _ decoherence _ , which rapidly destroys the quantum superposition at the heart of quantum algorithms .",
    "an essential element in the realization of such quantum computers is therefore the use of quantum error - correcting codes , which have been shown to ensure protection against decoherence  @xcite .",
    "quantum codes are similar in many respects to classical codes . in classical coding theory , logical words ( of @xmath0 bits )",
    "are encoded into codewords ( of @xmath1 bits ) .",
    "the latter are suitably chosen among the set of all @xmath2 possible words of @xmath3 bits so that the alteration because of noise of say @xmath4 bits ( at most ) can be recovered . a specific set of codewords then constitutes an @xmath5 $ ] code , encoding @xmath0 bits into @xmath3 bits and correcting all patterns of @xmath4 ( or fewer ) errors among those @xmath3 bits .",
    "the simplest example of a classical code with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the repetition code where a logical bit 0 ( or 1 ) is encoded into 000 ( or 111 ) ; decoding is simply performed using the majority rule , which is enough to recover @xmath8 errors . in classical coding theory ,",
    "corrupted data is thus restored by introducing redundancy ( @xmath1 ) , that is by duplicating part of the information that must be preserved .",
    "( in the above  very inefficient  example , information is triplicated . ) in quantum coding theory , the central issue is to find a set of @xmath9 quantum codewords ( of @xmath3 qubits ) such that _ quantum information _ can be protected against the alteration due to coupling with an environment ( _ i.e. _ , such that the quantum system survives decoherence ) . at first sight , it seems that , since the duplication of an arbitrary quantum state is forbidden by the quantum _ no - cloning _",
    "theorem@xcite , `` quantum redundancy '' is impossible .",
    "however , after the pioneering work of shor@xcite , it has been realized that quantum coding is achievable in spite of the no - cloning theorem , and a great deal of work has recently been devoted to this issue  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that quantum information can be distributed over many qubits through a suitable encoding and subsequently recovered after partial alteration , without violating the no - cloning theorem .",
    "in this paper , we aim at clarifying some aspects of quantum coding from a perspective centered on quantum entropies .",
    "it has been shown recently that classical and quantum entropies can be described within a unified information - theoretical framework involving negative conditional entropies  @xcite , as briefly outlined in appendix  [ sect_app ] . here",
    ", we apply this framework to quantum error - correcting codes , paralleling the classical description of error correction in shannon theory .",
    "we show that , for an arbitrary entanglement between the logical words and a `` reference '' system to be preserved , the quantum _ mutual _ entropy between this `` reference '' and any `` interacting '' part of the codewords must be vanishing prior to decoherence .",
    "in other words , an entropic condition for perfect quantum error correction is that the `` reference '' system is statistically _ independent _ of any arbitrarily chosen part of the codewords that might interact with the environment .",
    "this condition relies on the conservation of quantum mutual entropies implied by unitarity , along with the property of strong subadditivity of quantum entropies ( see appendix  [ sect_app ] ) .",
    "it expresses the fact that the environment can not become _ directly _ entangled with the `` reference '' system ( entanglement may arise only via the codewords ) , or , roughly speaking , that the environment can not extract information about the logical words .",
    "we continue by deriving the analogue of the singleton bound for quantum codes  @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 , using simple arguments based on this entropic approach . such an information - theoretic description of coding sheds new light on the interpretation of this bound in terms of `` weak '' cloning .",
    "while the quantum bits that are altered as a result of any error are statistically independent of the reference ( or the encoded logical word ) , the quantum information stored in the entire codeword remains unaffected .",
    "this results from the fact that the _ ternary _ mutual entropy vanishes for any entangled tripartite system in a pure state , a property which has no classical counterpart  @xcite .",
    "the central point is that , in contrast with classical codes , no duplicating  or full cloning  is achieved by _ quantum _ error - correcting codes .",
    "rather , a `` weak '' quantum cloning is achieved , such that any part of the codeword susceptible to decohere appears independent of the reference although the entire codeword remains entangled with it .",
    "this purely quantum situation is forbidden in classical information theory due to the non - negativity of shannon conditional entropies , and reflects a fundamental difference between classical and quantum error correcting codes .",
    "let us consider a set of orthogonal logical states @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) which are encoded into orthogonal codewords @xmath13 consisting of @xmath3 qubits .",
    "( the index @xmath14 refers to the quantum channel on which the codewords are sent . ) the states @xmath11 belong to the logical hilbert space @xmath15 of dimension @xmath16 spanned by the @xmath0 logical qubits , while the states @xmath13 belong to @xmath17 of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "we have clearly @xmath19 , which is the quantum equivalent of classical `` redundancy '' : the logical states are encoded in some @xmath9-dimensional subspace of the full @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space so that part of the information in the @xmath3 qubits is `` redundant '' . qualitatively speaking ,",
    "@xmath20 qubits of the codewords represent redundant information ( they are equivalent to the `` check bits '' of classical codes  @xcite ) . in section",
    "iv , we will make this concept of quantum `` redundancy '' more quantitative .",
    "the key property of a quantum code lies in its ability to protect an _",
    "arbitrary _ superposition of logical states @xmath21 against decoherence .",
    "equivalently , a quantum code is such that the entanglement of the @xmath0 logical qubits with a `` reference '' system @xmath22 is preserved against decoherence .",
    "in fact , this description of quantum coding as a mean to transmit ( or conserve ) entanglement with respect to @xmath22 in spite of the interaction with an environment is more convenient for our information - theoretic description and will be adopted in the following .",

    "following schumacher s model of a noisy channel  @xcite , we assume that the environment is initially in the pure state @xmath27 and then interacts with the channel according to the unitary transformation @xmath33 , so that the joint state of the entire system becomes @xmath34 ( the prime refers to the systems _ after _ decoherence . )",
    "this noisy channel is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig_schumacher ] and will be the basis of our description of quantum coding in terms of quantum entropies . more specifically , we will consider a `` deterministic '' error model in which the position of the erroneous bits is _ known _ , usually referred to as the quantum _ erasure _ channel  @xcite . in this channel ,",
    "the decoherence induced by the environment involves @xmath35 qubits at known locations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath35 erasures .",
    "the component @xmath36 ( of @xmath35 qubits ) of the codeword interacts with @xmath32 ( suffers @xmath35 erasures ) , while the rest @xmath37 ( of @xmath38 qubits ) is left unchanged by this interaction .",
    "accordingly , the unitary transformation in eq .",
    "( [ eq_uenvir ] ) is of the form @xmath39 as an example , we can suppose that the environment is made of @xmath35 qubits initially in a @xmath27 state and that @xmath40 effects the exchange between these qubits and the @xmath35 qubits of @xmath36 ( a reversible operation ) . as a result ,",
    "the qubits of @xmath36 are erased ( reset to @xmath27 ) while the qubits of @xmath32 get the original value of the erased qubits .",
    "as the environment is traced over in order to determine the state of the channel @xmath14 after decoherence , quantum information is apparently erased even though the overall process is unitary .",
    "of course , any other @xmath40 could result from decoherence , and a quantum erasure - correcting code will be such that the entanglement with @xmath22 is preserved for an arbitrary @xmath40 .    0.25 cm    [ fig_schumacher ] 0.25 cm    2 [ ]    before discussing coding and decoherence using quantum entropies ( section iv ) , let us first review some basics of quantum error - correcting codes .",
    "it is known that , rather than coupling the codewords with an environment , one can model the errors by use of error operators @xmath32 . for the purpose of error correction ,",
    "it is enough to consider errors of the type @xmath41 ( bit - flip ) , @xmath42 ( phase - flip ) , and @xmath43 ( bit- and phase - flip ) , since , by linearity , a code that can correct these errors can correct arbitrary errors  @xcite . for a @xmath5 $ ] code , _",
    "i.e. _ , a code correcting @xmath4 errors at most , the error operators @xmath32 applied on the codewords are of the form @xmath44 , _",

    "the one - bit error operators are any linear combinations of the algebra basis @xmath46 .",
    "it has been shown by knill and laflamme  @xcite that a necessary and sufficient condition on quantum error - correcting codes is that @xmath47 where the @xmath13 and @xmath48 are any two codewords and @xmath49 , @xmath50 are chosen from the set of @xmath4-error operators defined above . conditions ( [ eq_kl1 ] ) and ( [ eq_kl2 ] ) can be understood by considering the decoding operation as an `` inverse '' unitary transformation  @xcite that maps the @xmath3 qubits of the corrupted codeword @xmath51 into @xmath0 qubits ( the original logical word @xmath24 ) and @xmath20 check qubits ( the ancilla @xmath52 ) , as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig_schumacher ] . considering the action of decoding on two codewords @xmath53 and @xmath54 that have been corrupted by errors @xmath49 or @xmath50",
    ", it can be shown that the state in which the ancilla is left can not depend on the logical state , that is the decoding must be such that @xmath55 in other words , the final state of @xmath56 must be the same for both codewords @xmath13 and @xmath48 , and depend only on the error syndrome @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "this condition is clearly required in order to recover an initial _ arbitrary _ superposition @xmath59 ( _ i.e. _ , the ancilla must be in a tensor product with the @xmath0 logical qubits after decoding ) .",
    "conditions ( [ eq_kl1 ] ) and ( [ eq_kl2 ] ) then result straightforwardly from the orthogonality of the logical states @xmath11 and @xmath60 , and the conservation of scalar products by unitarity .    the above considerations also apply to the quantum _ erasure _ channel in which the position of the @xmath35 erroneous bits is _ known _  @xcite .",
    "note that conditions ( [ eq_kl1 ] ) and ( [ eq_kl2 ] ) obviously correspond to the case where the errors are applied at @xmath4 _ unknown _ positions in the codeword .",
    "clearly , if the error - correcting code aims at correcting for _ erasures _ only , the error operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 differ from each other by one - bit error operators at the _ same _ positions only . therefore , as the product of two such @xmath35-erasure operators",

    "this equivalence will be very useful in the following because the quantum erasure channel is easier to treat using an entropic approach . before coming to the information - theoretic analysis of quantum error - correcting codes ( section  iv ) , let us first analyze classical error correction in terms of entropies .",
    "this will make the classical - quantum correspondence more transparent .",
    "just like in the quantum case , one can define two classes of classical noisy channels , depending on the fact that the errors occur at known or unknown locations . in the former case ,",
    "the located errors are called _ erasures _ , and an erasure - correcting code is such that , if @xmath35 bits out of the @xmath3 bits are `` erased '' , it is possible to recover the encoded logical word from the @xmath38 remaining bits only  @xcite . in the latter case of classical codes",
    "capable of correcting @xmath4 errors at unknown positions in codewords of size @xmath3 , all the @xmath3 bits of the corrupted codewords must be used in the decoding operation .",
    "exactly as for quantum codes , it is easy to show that a classical code can correct @xmath4 errors at unknown locations if and only if the same code can correct @xmath62 erasures at known locations .",
    "the proof is as follows .",
    "let us consider two codewords of length @xmath3 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and two error strings , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( the bits in a codeword are flipped where the corresponding bits in the error string are equal to 1 ) . to be able to recover @xmath4 errors",
    ", we must have @xmath67 for any two codewords and for all possible error strings having @xmath4 bits ( or fewer ) equal to one . here",
    ", @xmath68 is the bitwise addition modulo 2 and @xmath69 means that the two strings must differ by at least one bit",
    ". a classical code correcting t errors must therefore be such that the distance between any two codewords is larger than or equal to @xmath70 , since the error strings @xmath65 and @xmath66 can have at most @xmath4 bits equal to one , implying that @xmath71 can have at most @xmath72 bits equal to one . now , in the case of codes capable of correcting @xmath35 erasures , the positions of the bits equal to one in @xmath65 and @xmath66 are identical , so that @xmath73 can have at most @xmath35 ( rather than @xmath74 ) bits equal to one and is therefore another @xmath35-error string just as @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the condition for recovering @xmath35 erasures is @xmath75 in other words , the distance between any two codewords must only be larger than or equal to @xmath76 .",

    "the resulting equivalence @xmath62 will be important for our concern because the entropic analysis is more adapted to erasure correction .",
    "let us shortly describe coding in the case of a classical erasure channel  @xcite .",
    "we consider encoding as a classical channel whose input @xmath77 is made of @xmath0 logical bits and output @xmath78 is made of @xmath3 physical bits ( the codewords ) .",
    "we assume that the set of logical words @xmath79 occur with probability @xmath80 , so that the entropy of the input @xmath77 is @xmath81 the input @xmath77 can be recorded ( a classical variable can be `` cloned '' ) and thus compared with the output @xmath78 . as the encoding is reversible ( it is a one - to - one mapping ) , the mutual entropy is conserved through encoding , that is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is defined as the mutual entropy ( or information ) between input and output that must be preserved in the classical erasure channel .",
    "let us assume that @xmath78 is split into @xmath35 erased bits , @xmath84 , and @xmath38 unchanged bits , @xmath85 .",
    "( the position of the erased and unchanged bits is known . )",

    "since we have @xmath87 as a result of eq .",
    "( [ eq_basiccondition ] ) , _ i.e. _ , it is obviously possible to infer @xmath77 from @xmath88 , we obtain the basic entropic condition for classical error correction @xmath89 physically this expresses that , conditionally on the @xmath38 unchanged bits , no information about @xmath77 is lost in the @xmath35 erased bits .",
    "classical coding works because the @xmath38 unaffected bits contain the entire information @xmath83 about @xmath77 , that is @xmath90 so that the @xmath35 bits that are erased are `` redundant '' . using the chain rule for shannon mutual entropies ,",
    "@xmath91 it is clear that eq .",

    "the general classical entropy diagram corresponding to this situation is represented in fig  [ fig_class ] .",
    "the condition for erasure correction , eq .  ( [ eq_classcond ] ) , appears in this figure as the vanishing entropy shared by @xmath77 and @xmath84 , but _ not _ by @xmath85 .",
