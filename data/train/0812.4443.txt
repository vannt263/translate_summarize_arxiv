    "due to successes in numerical relativity , there is now a good understanding of many features of the gravitational waves from the inspiral and merger of comparable mass black holes@xcite there are , however , areas that are still best investigated with an approximation method for the slow inspiral epoch .",
    "one area is the evolution and gravitational waveform during the slow inspiral ( but strong field ) epoch , since there are too many orbits for numerical relativity to be feasible .",
    "another area is the case of mass ratios too large for numerical relativity , but not large enough for particle perturbation methods .",
    "a slow inspiral approximation method is also useful as a starting point for a better understanding of the radiation reaction fields acting on an inspiralling hole .",
    "the periodic standing wave ( psw ) project is meant to provide such an approximation .",
    "this method seeks a numerical solution for a pair of sources ( black holes , neutron stars ) in nondecaying circular orbits with gravitational fields that are rigidly rotating , that is , fields that are helically symmetric . because the universality of gravitation will not permit outgoing waves and nondecaying orbits ,",
    "the solution to be computed is that for standing waves .",
    "an approximation for slowly decaying orbits with outgoing radiation is then extracted from that numerical solution .",
    "this work has progressed through several stages . in the first stage@xcite , a nonlinear scalar fields model was investigated , and numerical methods were developed to deal with the special mathematical features that would be common to all standing - wave , helically symmetric computations .",
    "these features include : ( i )  a mixed boundary value problem ( regions of the domain in which the equations are hyperbolic and other regions in which they are elliptic ) ; ( ii )  an iterative construction of nonlinear standing wave solutions ; ( iii )  the extraction from the standing wave solution of an approximate outgoing wave solution .",
    "reference @xcite introduced a new technique that promised to reduce the computational burden : `` adapted coordinates '' that were well suited to the geometry of the problem both near the sources and far from them . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that with these coordinates good results could be computed by keeping only a very small number of multipoles , typically just the monopole and quadrupole moments .",
    "that method was applied to linearized general relativity in ref .",
    "@xcite and to the post - minkowski approximation to general relativity in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the current paper",
    "we apply this method , psw in adapted coordinates , to full general relativity .",
    "the mathematical infrastructure for this is rather involved .",
    "it includes the definition of standing waves for nonlinear fields ; extraction of the outgoing solution ; the adapted spatial coordinates ; the multipole decomposition in adapted coordinates ; the reduction to helical symmetry for tensorial fields ; the full vacuum field equations ; the inner boundary conditions on surfaces outside black holes .",
    "this infrastructure has been thoroughly documented in earlier papers , and the complete infrastructure is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . rather than",
    "give yet another lengthy presentation of this infrastructure , here we will give only enough of the mathematical background necessary in order to explain the numerical results we are presenting , and to compare them with other numerical results .",

    "we invoke a set of coordinates labelled @xmath0 for which the spacetime metric @xmath1 deviates only slightly from the flat metric @xmath2 at large coordinate distances from the binary sources .",

    "this leads us to suggest that a similar eclectic use of algebraic manipulation software and numerical programming is a powerful approach not only for our problem but for other problems in which code must be generated for complex and lengthy mathematical expressions for which human coding is prone to error .",
    "however it is worth noting that neither maple nor any other computer algebra system is able by itself can directly generate the c expressions required for this kind of project . although most algebra systems features parsers to generate c code most of the time the native parsing algorithm can not deal with some subtleties .",
    "some of these subtleties include type specification for intermediate variables , data type signature of functions , the appropriate translation of some mathematical functions and the creation of header files among others .",
    "for the present work it became necessary to modify the native parser of _ maple _ in order to deal with these subtleties .",
    "in particular the syntax definition of the c parser was enlarged in order to include some mathematical functions while the parsing algorithm was modified in order to ensure the correct signature for the functions defined during the automated process .",
    "in addition some fine tuning was performed in the parser algorithm in order to avoid incorrect or unnecessary operations in the translated code , such as some type casts or incorrect array indexing .",
    "these kind of subtleties must be addressed and tailored to the occasion by any other project that wants to use a similar approach of the mixing computer algebra systems and analytic tools .",

    "( [ qterm ] ) , and through the very complicated dependence of @xmath143 on @xmath37 encoded in the equations ( [ eq : ginv ] ) , ( [ eq : hdef ] ) and ( [ eq : psifirst])([eq : psilast ] ) . in our work on the post - minkowski approximation@xcite only the first dependence was kept , since inclusion of the dependence through @xmath143 would have gone beyond the order of the approximation .",
    "but in the present work , for the full equations of general relativity , we can not ignore this deeper nonlinearity .",
    "in fact , it is precisely this dependence that , in our formalism , distinguishes full general relativity from the second - order post - minkowski approximation .",
    "the complexity of this nonlinearity , however , leads to a practical problem .    in our work , here and",
    "previously , with nonlinear equations , the mathematical problem to be solved was cast into the form @xmath144 in which @xmath145 is a linear operator on the unknown function , or set of functions @xmath146 .",
    "a solution could be sought in two ways .",
    "a direct iteration could be used in which an approximate solution @xmath147 is substituted into @xmath148 and the linear equation @xmath149 for a new approximation @xmath150 is solved , with appropriate boundary conditions . alternatively , newton - raphson iteration can be used . in this method a linear equation is found by expanding the @xmath146 dependence of @xmath148 about @xmath151 , with a jacobian playing the role of the derivative of @xmath152 with respect to the fields @xmath146 .",
    "newton - raphson iteration is expected to have better convergence properties than direct iteration , and this was indeed found to be the case in previous work .    in principle , then , it is a newton - raphson scheme that is to be sought .",
    "but due to the complicated dependence of @xmath153 on @xmath141 this does not turn out to be feasible . with _",
    "maple _ generated code the evaluation of the jacobian needed in the newton - raphson method becomes unreasonable long .",
    "the main reason for this is that the code generated by _",
    "maple _ is optimized for execution time by unrolling lengthy evaluations explicitly in several steps using several temporary variables . as a consequence",
    "this highly optimized code is extremely lengthy in terms of the number of code lines . as the number of terms given to _ maple",
    "_ increases so does the code that must be compiled .",
    "if the number of terms is high enough the raw code generated with the _ maple _ tools becomes so lengthy that it is impossible to compile .",
    "this has severely limited the applicability of this automated process for newton - raphson methods for a fully relativistic model .",
    "for this reason the fully relativistic model was ultimately implemented using a direct iteration scheme .     using direct iteration .",
    "the field is shown as a function of coordinate radius along a line in the orbital plane approximately through the source points ( i.e. , at @xmath154 ) .",
    "the simulation parameters here are @xmath155 , @xmath156 , with @xmath157 .",
    "the computation includes all multipoles up to @xmath158 ( monopole and quadrupole terms kept ) although the monopole term @xmath124 is not included in the results displayed . ]",
    "we have found that the use of direct iteration does not seem to be a major problem . in particular ,",
    "models with parameters that allowed convergence for post - minkowski models with newton - raphson iteration have been found to converge in full general relativity with direct iteration .",
    "one reason for this , is that we have limited our application of the full general relativity models to those for which the post - minkowski approximation is valid . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , this means that @xmath159 must not be chosen very small , to avoid very strong nonlinearities .",
    "this in turn leads to the constraint on model parameters@xcite @xmath160 with this restriction on field strengths convergence has been found to be very good .",
    "this successful convergence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullgrconvergence ] for @xmath118 .",
    "these results show that convergence is attained after 3 to 4 iterations for angular velocity @xmath155 ; similar or faster convergence is found for all smaller values of @xmath4 .",
    "we usually consider @xmath155 to be the limit of the angular velocity for which the psw method gives a good approximation to the outgoing solution .",
    "a very important consideration for the success of the computations , and of the psw approach , is the value of @xmath159 , since this parameter determines the maximum field strength encountered in the computation .",
    "moreover , results that are sensitive to the choice of @xmath159 raise questions about the underlying assumption in the psw approach that the details of the inner boundary condition are not important to the fields except very near the inner boundary",
    ". figures [ fig : fullgromega0.15differentinnerchis ] show the results for all fields , for a model with @xmath155 .",
    "these results , show somewhat mixed results for the insensitivity to the value of @xmath159 . for the `` coulombic '' field @xmath117 the computed result is particularly insensitive to @xmath159 .",
    "several of the fields show significant diffrences in the results for the three values of @xmath159 .",
    "one would expect that the results for the largest value of @xmath159 should have errors in representing the boundary conditions appropriate for a `` point '' particle , since @xmath161 is not really justified as a `` near source '' surface .",
    "one might expect better agreement between the two smaller values of @xmath159 , since both inner boundaries are reasonably close to the source `` points . ''",
    "the results tend to confirm this , though with exceptions .",
    "of particular interest are the results for @xmath162 , since these fields carry the information about gravitational waves in the weak wave zone .",
    "for these fields the results for @xmath163 and @xmath164 agree moderately well in phase , but have amplitude differences as large as a factor of 2 .",
    "a study of the origin of this difference will help clarify the nature of the correct boundary conditions .",
    "it should be noted that the computations of the fields within full general relativity have turned out to be less sensitive to the choice of @xmath165 than are the post - minkowski computations . in some way ,",
    "the inclusion of the dependence of @xmath143 on the fields moderates the sensitivity of the results to @xmath165 .",
    "another type of comparison is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : linpmnrfullgromega0.075 ] , the comparison of computations based on linearized , post - minkowski and fully relativistic models for @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the monopole term @xmath124 is not included in the results shown for @xmath119 , @xmath118 , and @xmath117 .",
    "the results show that @xmath117 and @xmath168 are very well approximated within the post - minkowski model .",
    "all other fields differ in more or less a significant way with respect to the post - minkowski results , showing that the fully relativistic contributions are of significance , even for the moderate field strengths of these computations . in this connection",
    "it should be noted that the field @xmath117 is very well approximated by lower order approximations .",
    "it is only this field that was used in the source term for the iterations in ref .",
    "thus , it is not the imperfections in @xmath117 that are the basis of the inaccuracies , but rather the suppressed dependences on additional fields .     +   +   +     +   +   +",
    "the results presented in the previous section for the fully relativistic case show the same convergence rate as was found for the directly iterated post - minkowski approximation and show similar limitations in field strength as the newton - raphson method for the post - minkowski approximation .",
    "the results also reveal that the nonlinearities present in the fully relativistic model produce important changes in the numerical solutions for most of the fields . for",
    "the most important field of the post - minkowski approximation @xmath117 , it is comforting to note that there is excellent agreement of the post - minkowski and fully relativistic results .",
    "the fact that @xmath168 is also well represented by the post - minkowski computation is also a good sign .",
    "these good agreements are expected qualitatively since the post - minkowski approximation is correct up to second order in the small parameter @xmath169 while @xmath117 and @xmath168 are of order 1 and 1.5 , respectively , in the same parameter . in this sense",
    "the relativistic results confirms the validity of the post - minkowski approximation .",
    "it is important to mention not only the strengths of the method but also its shortcomings .",
    "first , the use of adapted coordinates gives a solution on an irregular computational grid on the minkowski background of the problem . as a consequence the results obtained from the computations require a difficult interpolation if they are to be compared with other results or used as initial data for evolution codes .",
    "second , the method is inherently limited in its accuracy .",
    "higher accuracy , would ultimately require more multipoles , and an increase in the number of multipoles adds to the size of the equation set to be generated by _",
    "maple _ , and to the compilation problem .    the current accuracy , however , is sufficient for us to see in the results presented in the previous section that there is sensitivity of the computed fields to the location of the inner boundary @xmath170 .",
    "the inner boundary conditions used for the computations are those for a a spherically symmetric mass point , or schwarzschild hole , boosted so that it is instantaneously comoving with the rotating coordinates .",
    "( for a detailed discussion see ref .",
    "this is , of course , an approximation that ignores the tidal effects of the two source points on each other and the fact that the sources are not moving in straight lines of a minkowksi background",
    ". that approximation would be adequate at sufficiently small @xmath4 , but ",
    "the results suggest  not at @xmath171 .    improved",
    "inner boundary conditions are an important application of the psw method , since this is part of the use of the method to study radiation reaction .",
    "but the issue of the inner boundary condition may not be separable from the issue of the gauge condition , which might explain the sensitivity of the results to @xmath170 even for the relatively small angular rotation rate @xmath171 .",
    "the `` gauge issue '' is the fact that we have used a specific gauge , that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hggauge ] ) , but we have not enforced or checked that gauge in the solution . if the problem is well posed then there should be a solution which can be transformed to this gauge .",
    "the question of well - posedness directs attention to the inner boundary condition , and the multipoles at the inner boundary .",
    "the coarsest parameter in those boundary conditions is simply the mass that we ascribe to the source , a mass that we have linked to the angular velocity @xmath4 through the nonrelativistic kepler law .",
    "one would certainly expect relativistic corrections to that relationship , so in a sense our solution of the fully general relativistic problem has omitted an important source of nonlinearity .    with the adapted coordinate method we have demonstrated that the psw computations can be brought to a level of accuracy adequate for studying features of the strong fields and inner boundary conditions .",
    "it is therefore capable , in principle , of giving useful insights about radiation reaction contained in the details of the near fields .",
    "the method can also be used in the future to provide a quasistationary sequence of simulation parameters ( i.e. , mass , orbital radius and angular velocity ) .",
    "such sequence will represent more than adequately the slow inspiral process of the binary .",
    "the main challenge for this approach is that it is important to show that we are comparing the `` same '' system at different radii ( i.e. , that some physical quantities are conserved although energy is lost during the process ) . for binary neutron stars",
    "the baryon number must be unchanged . in the case of black holes",
    "the issue is more difficult , since the total mass of the system decreases as energy is emitted .",
    "however the local mass of the black holes should not change ; this local mass could be calculated at each stage of the sequence using numerical codes designed to detect horizons locally , as described by ashtekar _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the current work has solved the problem with the accuracy that was sought , and a broader lesson might lie in that success .",
    "the success was achieved through the combination of a computer algebra system such as _ maple _ and numerical programming .",
    "this combination can be a powerful approach to some problems that requires not only fast and sophisticated numerical algorithms but also a fast and sophisticated implementation process .",
    "the lesson in the psw program is that the use of a highly analytical approach to the problem ( adapted coordinates and multipole filtering ) translated into an increased complexity in the algebraic form of the equation . while humans are prone to errors when manipulating lengthy expressions , computers are not . leaving the details of the manipulation and coding to an algebraic manipulation language is a natural choice for this sort of problems",
    "of course such an approach involves the development of tools adapted to the needs of a particular project within _ maple _ or any similar development platform , which can be quite challenging .",
    "however , once the tools are developed and benchmarked the correctness of the numerical implementation is guaranteed , which is a highly desirable feature for projects involving complex numerical implementations .",
