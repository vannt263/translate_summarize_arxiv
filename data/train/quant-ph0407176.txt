    "at a fundamental level quantum information ( qi )  consists of the set of rules that identify and characterize the physical transformations that are applicable to the quantum state of any information system . because of the constraints established by the quantum rules it is found that several classical information tasks are  forbidden or can not be perfectly extended to the quantum world .",
    "a well known and relevant qi  limitation consists of the impossibility of perfectly cloning ( copying ) any unknown qubit @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in other words , the map @xmath4 can not be realized by nature because it does not belong to the set of completely positive @xmath5  maps , i.e. the only ones consistent with all requirements of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this basic result may be the most fundamental difference between classical and quantum information theory .",
    "another forbidden operation is the not gate that maps any @xmath6 in its orthogonal state @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "even if these two processes are unrealizable in their exact forms , they can be optimally approximated by the so - called _ universal quantum machines _ ,",
    "i.e. which exhibit the minimum possible noise . a better understanding of these devices is important since the exact characterization of the quantum constraints within basically simple qi  processes is useful to design more sophisticated algorithms and protocols and to assess the limit performance of complex networks , such as a quantum computer . in this paper",
    "we shall analyze the _ optimal _ realizations of the not gate and of the cloning machine within the enlightening perspective suggested by the new linear optical method that has been recently adopted to achieve such realizations .",
    "the @xmath8  of a gate , i.e. that measures how close its action is to the desired one , is generally quantified by the _ fidelity _ @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 implies a perfect implementation , while noisy processes correspond to @xmath11 .",
    "the universal not ( unot ) gate , the optimal approximation of the not gate , maps @xmath12 identical input qubits @xmath13 into @xmath14 optimal flipped ones in the state @xmath15 .",
    "it achieves the fidelity : @xmath16 = @xmath17 = @xmath18 that depends only on the number of the input qubits @xcite .",
    "indeed the fidelity of the unot gate is exactly the same as the optimal quantum estimation fidelity @xcite .",
    "this  means that such process may be modelled as a  classical  , i.e. exact , preparation of @xmath14 identical flipped qubits following the quantum , i.e. inexact , estimation of @xmath12 input states .",
    "only this last operation is affected by noise . only in the limit",
    "@xmath19 a perfect estimation of the input state is achieved and a perfect flipping operation is also realized . differently from the unot gate , the universal optimal quantum cloning machine ( uoqcm ) , which transforms @xmath12 identical qubits @xmath6 into @xmath14 identical copies @xmath20 , achieves as optimal fidelity : @xmath21 = @xmath22 = @xmath23 = @xmath24 with @xmath25@xcite . as we can see @xmath26 is larger than the one obtained by the @xmath12 estimation approach and reduces to that result for @xmath27 , i.e. for an infinite number of copies . of course the zero - cloning condition",
    "is expressed by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the extra positive term @xmath30 in the above expression accounts for the excess of quantum information which , originally stored in @xmath12 states , is optimally redistributed by entanglement among  the @xmath31 remaining blank qubits encoded by uoqcm @xcite . precisely , the entanglement is established by the cloning process between the blank qubits and the machine itself which may be modelled as a  ancilla  information system .",
    "the first conceptual approach to the realization of these transformations is based on finding a suitable unitary operator @xmath32 , deterministically realized by means of a quantum network and acting on @xmath12 input qubits and on @xmath33 ancillary qubits . at the output of this device",
    "we obtain @xmath14 and @xmath34 qubits which are , respectively , the optimal clones and the best flipped qubits of the input ones @xcite . a different approach to the probabilistic implementation of the @xmath0 cloning process has been proposed by werner @xcite .",
    "it is based on the action of a projective operation on the symmetric subspace of the @xmath12 input qubits and @xmath34 blank ancillas .",
    "this transformation assures the uniform distribution of the initial information into the overall system and guarantees that all output qubits are indistinguishable .",
    "while previous realizations @xcite were inspired by the first approach , the work reported in the present paper follows the path established by the last theoretical proposals , as we see shortly .    in quantum optics",
    "let the qubit to be codified by the polarization state of a single photon .",
    "precisely in this context it was proposed to realize the @xmath35 transformation by exploiting any amplification process e.g. realized by the quantum injected optical parametric amplifier ( qiopa ) in the entangled configuration @xcite .",
    "indeed the experimental demonstrations of the uoqcm and the unot gate have been reported by exploiting precisely this technique @xcite .",
    "the cloning process ( but not the unot gate ) was also realized by a simple laser amplifier in a @xmath36 optical fiber @xcite .    in the present work",
    "the more direct qubit symmetrization path proposed by werner was taken , as said . in this perspective",
    "an entirely new scenario has been disclosed by the recent discovery that it is possible to implement contextually the @xmath2 universal quantum cloning machine ( uoqcm ) and the @xmath37 universal not gate by slightly modifying the quantum state teleportation @xmath38 protocol @xcite . since in this case",
    "the unot gate is transferred , i.e_. teleported _ , in a different location , it will be referred to as the _ tele - unot gate .",
    "_ this indeed realizes a novel qi  protocol : the _   teleportation of a quantum operation_.    in section ii of the present work the tele - unot  protocol is investigated theoretically by a quantum network approach on the basis of the qubit symmetrization process .",
    "furthermore , this same process is shown to lead very naturally to the efficient qubit purification protocol recently realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "section iii reports a most general application of the symmetrization protocol , indeed one of the key results of the present work :  the programmable optimal teleportation of _ any _ anti - unitary gate acting on qubits . in section iv a general and comprehensive theory of the @xmath0 uoqcm and  of the @xmath39 tele - unot  gate is given by adopting a novel and straightforward theoretical approach to the problem , i.e. the well established@xmath40 angular momentum formalism of a general @xmath41spin system .",

    "vi the experimental implementation and characterization of the optimal transpose of a @xmath42 density operator by a stochastic method is reported .",
    "this is done in order to investigate , at a deeper level how the unot gate can be realized starting from the teleportation protocol .",
    "finally , in section vii the main results of the work are summarized and considered in the perspectives of modern quantum information , computation and estimation theories .",
