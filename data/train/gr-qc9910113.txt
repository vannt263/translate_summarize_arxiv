    "<S> we can solve eq.([eq : rot4 ] ) for @xmath38 easily . </S>",
    "<S> a trivial solution is @xmath39 this corresponds to the region of no bosonic matter field , i.e. , the vacuum outside a star . the interior solution for @xmath38 is @xmath40 this describes the configuration of the boson field inside a star .    </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath41 yields a remarkable consequence . for nonzero @xmath42 , any positive value for the solution become impossible in the vicinity of the origin . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for a sufficiently small value for @xmath43 , the solution for @xmath44 must be @xmath45 . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , a rotating boson star has a vacuum `` hole '' in its central region ! </S>",
    "<S> we note that the rotating boson star in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions also has a similar structure in the central region  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if we require that there is no singularity in the central vacuum region , the spacetime must be a usual anti - de sitter spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in the central region @xmath46 this determines the value of @xmath47 in the central region as @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , a set of equations  ( [ eq : rot1]-[eq : rot4 ] ) can not be solved analytically . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we solve these equations numerically here .    to solve the full solution numerically </S>",
    "<S> , we must specify the boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the central vacuum region is the range @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the value for @xmath50 gives the location of the inside boundary of a rotating boson star . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 from the previous consideration . </S>",
    "<S> obviously @xmath11 has a constant value in the vacuum regions . </S>",
    "<S> thus the value for @xmath11 in the vacuum regions can be additively modified by redefinition of the time coordinate , etc .. therefore we take @xmath52 without any loss of generality . because of the continuity of the solution for @xmath38 , a condition is required : @xmath53 where @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we will solve the field equations numerically from @xmath55 . in the numerical solutions , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 becomes zero again at @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the region @xmath57 is outside of a rotating boson star , that is , the vacuum region where @xmath45 . in this region </S>",
    "<S> , we can analytically solve the equations by using the boundary value for variables at @xmath58 . in the outside vacuum region , </S>",
    "<S> the metric is described by btz solution @xcite .    by these conditions </S>",
    "<S> , we can solve the field equations numerically . </S>",
    "<S> now the arbitary parameter set is three conditions , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical solutions for some parameter sets are shown fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] @xmath44 as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath43 is shown . </S>",
    "<S> as seen before , we see that the boson star has a vacuum hole in the center of the star . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 is the parameter that indicates the magnitude of the rotation . for a small @xmath61 , </S>",
    "<S> the configuration of the boson star is similar to the nonrotating boson star . </S>",
    "<S> this nonrotating boson star has already been studied  @xcite . for a large @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> , the boson star has a large vacuum hole and a large radius . </S>",
    "<S> the region where the matter exists becomes narrow .    </S>",
    "<S> we can not , however , caluculate numerical values of @xmath44 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 , and @xmath62 for _ all _ set of the conditions @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath60 . for some parameter sets , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 diverges before connecting the outside vacuum region . </S>",
    "<S> scalar curvature of the rotating boson star is the following : @xmath63.\\ ] ] if @xmath44 diverge , scalar curvature also diverge . </S>",
    "<S> then there is a singularity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is worth noting that the parameter region for the possible solutions is restricted .    for the possible solutions , we can calculate the physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> now , we consider the mass of the boson star . since the external solutions of boson stars correspond to btz solutions , the mass of the boson star is identified with the btz mass . </S>",
    "<S> we define the total mass of the boson star with the mass of the boson star observed at infinity . for the outside of the boson star , the equation ( [ eq : rot1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rot3 ] ) are shown @xmath64 from the equation ( [ 611 ] ) , @xmath65 where @xmath58 is the external boundary of the boson star , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> then we find from the equation ( [ 610 ] ) , @xmath68 we integrate this in the external region of the boson star : @xmath69 here , we note that @xmath70    thus the total mass of the boson star is given , @xmath71 where @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> the particle number of the boson star is given , @xmath73 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2\\pi\\int dr\\frac{re^{\\delta}}{\\delta}2\\varphi^2\\left(\\omega\\ell-\\omega\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2gm}\\int dr_*\\frac{r_*\\varphi^2_*e^{\\delta}\\bar{\\omega}}{c_*r_*^2-\\bar{m } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2gm } \\int dr_*~\\frac{r _ *   e^{\\delta}}{\\delta } \\bar{\\omega } \\varphi_*^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by using the obtained mass and particle number , the binding energy can be defined . the value of btz mass @xmath74 is negative when the matter of boson star is a little . in particular , in the limit of `` no matter '' , @xmath74 approaches @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we will take the binding energy as @xmath76    the binding energy must be negative for the stable boson star . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the region of stable solution is restricted . </S>",
    "<S> the region of the stable and possible solution is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . in this parameter region , the stable boson star can exist . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , the maximum value of the cosmological constant is @xmath77 for @xmath78 . for a nonrotating boson star , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of the cosmological constant is also @xmath77 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is trivial , because a rotating solution approaches a nonrotating solution when @xmath78 . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , one can find the region where the stable boson star can exist is restricted .    </S>",
    "<S> these parameters , particularly @xmath61 and @xmath59 , is not the meaningful physical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus we rewrite these parameters in the meaningful physical parameters . instead of these , we will use the angular momentum of the boson star @xmath79 , the mass of the boson star @xmath74 and the cosmological constant @xmath60 as the meaningful physical parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the angular momentum of the boson star . </S>",
    "<S> since the external solution of the boson star corresponds to btz solution , @xmath12 is given as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the angular momentum of the boson star . </S>",
    "<S> thus the angular momentum of the boson star @xmath79 is given by @xmath82    using these parameter , @xmath79 , @xmath74 and @xmath60 , the region of the stable boson star is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . simplifying fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , the region of the stable boson star is shown with @xmath83 and @xmath74 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] .    in the region of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , the stable boson star can exist . </S>",
    "<S> to understand fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , we consider the case of the black hole physics . in the case of the black hole , it is known that the black hole with the larger angular momentum than its mass has the naked singularity and can not be a usual black hole . in an opposite case , as the larger mass than the angular momentum , the black hole can be a usual black hole . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the boson star become the black hole adiabatically , the boson star with @xmath84 can become the usual black hole .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , there is the relation @xmath85 when the mass is large . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is interesting . because the black hole , which has such the same value of the angular momentum and the mass , is the extreme black hole . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the boson star with the large mass can certainly become the extreme black hole . in the case of boson stars , </S>",
    "<S> how the behavior of the extreme black hole is appeared is very interesting . </S>",
    "<S> but , if the mass of boson star is larger , the singularity is more often caused and we can not calculate the field equations numerically . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the numerical analysis of boson stars with the sufficient large mass is very difficult .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have obtained the numerical solutions describing the rotating boson stars with a very large self - coupling constant in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the rotating boson star has a vacuum hole in the center of the star . and </S>",
    "<S> the region of the solution for the stable boson star is shown . </S>",
    "<S> there is the maximum value of the cosmological constant @xmath77 , where @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the nonrotating case . </S>",
    "<S> when the mass of boson star is large , there is the relation between the angular momentum and the mass of boson star , @xmath85 .    </S>",
    "<S> the future plan for study of boson stars is the following . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of boson star with the actually finite value of self - coupling is of much interest and will be necessary . more general cases including such as a @xmath87 coupling may exhibit more complicated results , but the analysis of them can be carried out in the same manner as in the present study . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the model of the spinning boson star in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions has been studied  @xcite . the similarity and the difference , between our model and the model in the other dimensions , must be further studied . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , it is interesting to study the shape of the boson star with a large angular momentum in various dimensions . </S>"
