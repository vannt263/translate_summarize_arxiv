    "in this section we prove :    a graph on @xmath0 vertices ( where @xmath12 ) with at least @xmath1 edges has @xmath13 as a minor .",
    "we begin with some definitions .",
    "a * graph * @xmath14 is a finite vertex set @xmath15 and edge family @xmath16 , and we mean @xmath14 to be simple , connected , and undirected .",
    "a graph is labeled @xmath17 , and called the * complete graph * on @xmath0 vertices , if every vertex in the graph is adjacent to every other vertex .",

    "* proof : * ( of theorem  [ thmk6 ] ) we proceed using induction on @xmath0 , the number of vertices of our graph @xmath14 . if @xmath23 , then @xmath14 has at least @xmath24 edges . since @xmath13 is the only graph on @xmath25 vertices with @xmath26 edges , @xmath27 .",
    "we now assume that any graph on @xmath28 vertices ( with at least @xmath29 edges ) has a @xmath13 minor .",
    "let @xmath14 be a graph on @xmath0 vertices that has @xmath1 edges .",
    "( note that if @xmath30 , then @xmath14 has a minor on @xmath1 edges which can be obtained through edge deletions . )",
    "if @xmath14 has two adjacent vertices with less than four common neighbors , then contracting their edge results in a graph on @xmath31 vertices with at least @xmath32 edges . by induction",
    ", @xmath14 has a @xmath13 minor .",
    "therefore , we may assume that each pair of adjacent vertices in @xmath14 has at least four common neighbors .",
    "this implies that every vertex in @xmath14 has degree at least five .",
    "suppose every vertex in @xmath14 has degree eight or more .",
    "since the number of edges is half the degree sum , this would mean @xmath14 has at least @xmath33 edges contradicting our assumption of @xmath1 edges .",
    "the remainder of the argument will focus on a vertex @xmath34 of least degree .",
    "that is , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "we are left with three cases , @xmath38 , @xmath25 , and @xmath39 .",
    "suppose @xmath38 .",
    "consider the subgraph @xmath18 on the neighbors of @xmath34 .",
    "each of the neighbors of @xmath34 must share at least four common neighbors with it and , therefore , has degree @xmath40 in @xmath18 .",
    "but then @xmath18 is a simple graph with five vertices and @xmath41 edges , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "thus , because @xmath34 is connected to every vertex in @xmath18 , the graph on @xmath34 and its neighbors is @xmath13 , implying @xmath14 has a @xmath13 minor .    now , suppose @xmath43 .",
    "consider the graph @xmath18 on the neighbors of @xmath34 : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "since every vertex @xmath50 must share at least four common neighbors with @xmath34 , @xmath51 .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 has at least @xmath52 edges .",
    "however , we know that if @xmath53 , then @xmath18 contains a @xmath54 minor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.13 ) , implying that @xmath14 contains a @xmath13 minor .",
    "so , we may assume that @xmath18 has exactly @xmath55 edges and each vertex has degree @xmath40 .",
    "there is only one such graph : a degree 4-regular triangulation on six vertices ( see left of figure  [ figdeg6 ] ) .    a vertex of degree @xmath25 ]    notice that @xmath18 is @xmath13 less the edges @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "if we add back any of those three edges @xmath18 will have at least 13 edges , hence a @xmath54 minor and then @xmath14 will have a @xmath13 minor .",
    "let @xmath60 be the subgraph formed from @xmath14 by removing @xmath34 and its six edges .",
    "then @xmath60 has @xmath31 vertices and @xmath61 edges .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the graph obtained by removing the edges of @xmath18 .",
    "we can assume that there is no path in @xmath62 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , for otherwise , we can contract along the edges of the path to form a minor in @xmath14 of the form @xmath63 with @xmath64 having 13 edges .",
    "that is , @xmath14 would have a @xmath13 minor .",
    "similarly , in @xmath62 we can assume there is no path between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , nor any path linking @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this means that each vertex in @xmath65 is connected to at most three of the vertices in @xmath66 by edges in @xmath62 .",
    "this will allow us to divide @xmath60 into eight subgraphs that overlap only in the subgraph @xmath18 .",
    "to illustrate this , we will construct a new graph @xmath67 consisting of the disjoint union of the eight subgraphs .",
    "let s first use @xmath18 to create eight disjoint triangles @xmath68 , as at right in figure 1 .",
    "note that this entails doubling each edge of @xmath18 and making four copies of each vertex .",
    "the vertices of @xmath67 will be those of @xmath65 along with the vertices of @xmath69 .",
    "so , we ve added three extra copies of each of the six vertices in @xmath18 and , therefore , @xmath67 will have @xmath70 vertices .",
    "the edges of @xmath67 will be those of @xmath62 along with two copies of each edge of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , @xmath67 will have @xmath71 edges .",
    "now , the vertices of @xmath68 are connected as eight @xmath72 s and the vertices in @xmath73 are connected to one another as they were in @xmath62 . to complete the construction of @xmath67",
    ", we need only describe how the edges between vertices of @xmath18 and vertices in @xmath65 are placed in @xmath67 .",
    "for example , let s look at the edges incident on @xmath44 .",
    "suppose @xmath74 is a neighbor of @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath75 can be connected in @xmath62 to at most two other vertices of @xmath18 .",
    "for example , if @xmath75 is also connected to @xmath46 and @xmath48 , then in @xmath67 , we will connect @xmath75 to the vertex @xmath76 in @xmath77 , because @xmath77 is the triangle corresponding to the triangle @xmath78 in @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath75 is connected to at most one other vertex in @xmath18 , say @xmath46 , then in @xmath67 , we have the choice of connecting @xmath75 to @xmath77 or @xmath79 as those are the two triangles containing copies of the vertices @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "we will adopt the convention of connecting it to the @xmath80 of lower index , in this case @xmath77 .",
    "that is , in @xmath67 there will be an edge between @xmath75 and the vertex @xmath76 in @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath75 is connected to no other vertex in @xmath18 , we have four choices , @xmath81 , of where to connect @xmath75 in @xmath67 .",
    "again , we will opt for @xmath77 , the choice of lowest index . in a similar way , each neighbor @xmath75 of @xmath82 is attached to one of the graphs @xmath80 .",
    "this placement is unambiguous if @xmath75 is connected to three vertices of @xmath18 , it is made among a choice of two @xmath80 if @xmath75 is connected to only two vertices , and it is made from a choice of four @xmath80 if @xmath75 is connected to only one vertex in @xmath18 .",
    "when there is a choice , we will use the @xmath80 of least index @xmath83 among the given options .",
    "this completes the construction of @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath84 be the connected component of @xmath80 in @xmath67 . since @xmath14 was connected , @xmath85 . on the other hand , since we are assuming there is no path in @xmath62 connecting @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , or @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the @xmath84 must be disjoint .",
    "now , @xmath67 has @xmath86 vertices and @xmath87 edges . by the pigeon hole principle",
    ", this means that one of the subgraphs @xmath84 has @xmath88 vertices and at least @xmath89 .",
    "this means @xmath84 is not simply a triangle , so @xmath90 ( recall each vertex has degree at least six ) .",
    "thus , @xmath84 is a proper subgraph of @xmath14 that has a @xmath13 minor .",
    "a vertex of degree @xmath39 . ]    finally , suppose @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the induced graph on the neighbors of @xmath34 .",
    "again , each vertex must have degree @xmath40 or more and there are fewer than @xmath92 edges .",
    "there are several such graphs , but only one has no @xmath54 minor .",
    "this time it is a triangulation on seven vertices with two vertices of degree five and five vertices of degree four , and with 10 triangles ( see figure  [ figdeg7 ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath67 has @xmath93 vertices and @xmath94 edges .",
    "there must be a subgraph of @xmath67 that has at least @xmath95 edges .",
    "so , @xmath14 has a subgraph that has a @xmath13 minor , implying @xmath14 has a @xmath13 minor .",
    "in this section we present a classification of intrinsic linking of @xmath3-deficient graphs , i.e. , complete and complete partite graphs .",
    "we also include the classification of intrinsic knotting found in @xcite for the reader s convenience .",
    "we begin with some lemmas .    if we know that a graph @xmath14 contains a linked ( knotted ) minor , then @xmath14 must also be linked ( knotted )  @xcite .",
    "conversely , if we can realize @xmath14 as a minor of an unlinked ( unknotted ) graph , we deduce that @xmath14 must also be unlinked ( unknotted ) .",
    "a useful lemma in this regard shows how we can combine parts of a @xmath10-deficient graph .",
    "recall that @xmath96 denotes the complete @xmath97 partite graph with @xmath88 vertices in the @xmath83th part .",
    "let @xmath98 denote a graph obtained by removing @xmath10 edges from @xmath99 .",
    "[ combparts ] @xmath100 is a minor of @xmath99 .",
    "similarly , every graph of the form @xmath98 has a minor of the form @xmath101 .",
    "* proof : * combining the @xmath102 and @xmath103 parts only involves removing edges between vertices in the @xmath102 part and the @xmath103 part .",
    "recall that with complete partite graphs , the ordering of the subscripts is not important , so this lemma implies that we can combine any 2 parts to get a minor of the original graph .    now , suppose we have a complete partite graph with @xmath10 edges removed and we combine two parts . the result would be a complete partite graph with one fewer part and at most @xmath10 edges removed .",
    "furthermore , if , in @xmath104 , there are @xmath105 edges missing between parts @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we can see that @xmath104 has a minor of the form @xmath106 .",
    "the other main technique we will use in our classifications ( aside from theorems  [ thmik ] and [ thmil ] and lemma  [ combparts ] ) is based on a lemma for intrinsic linking due to sachs  @xcite and an analogous result for intrinsic knotting due to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath107 denote the join of graphs @xmath14 and @xmath18 , i.e. , the graph obtained by taking the union of @xmath14 and @xmath18 and adding an edge between each vertex of @xmath14 and each vertex of @xmath18 .    [ sachs ]",
    "the graph @xmath108 is intrinsically linked if and only if g is non - planar    [ flemming ]    the graph @xmath109 is intrinsically knotted if and only if @xmath14 is non - planar    surveying the methods that we will use in the rest of the paper , we see that we will not be introducing any new minor minimal graphs for intrinsically knotting . indeed , if we use lemma  [ flemming ] to argue that a graph @xmath110 is intrinsically knotted , then , @xmath14 must contain @xmath54 or @xmath111 as a minor .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 contains @xmath8 or @xmath9 as a minor .",
    "similarly , theorem  [ thmik ] is based on showing that the graph has a @xmath8 minor . as our only other technique ( demonstrating an intrinsically knotted minor ) relies on the graphs derived from @xmath8 and @xmath9 by triangle - y exchanges",
    ", our methods can not introduce new minor minimal examples .",
    "in other words , every intrinsically knotted graph that is @xmath3- , @xmath4- , or @xmath5-deficient or a graph on @xmath6 vertices necessarily has as a minor @xmath8 , @xmath9 or a graph obtained from one of these by triangle - y exchanges .",

    ".intrinsic linking of complete @xmath10-partite graphs . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we give the classification of @xmath5-deficient graphs with respect to intrinsic linking and knotting in tables  [ il2def1 ] , [ il2def2 ] , [ ik2def1 ] , [ ik2def2 ] , and [ ik2def3 ] .",
    "the argument justifying this classification is very similar to that presented in the last section and we will not include it here .",
    "see  @xcite for a full account .",
    "* notation : * we will expand the notation that we created in the last section by adding subscripts to the vertices .",
    "for example , if we are removing two edges between parts a and b of @xmath112 , there are 3 cases to be considered : deleting two edges that share a vertex from part a ( @xmath112-\\{@xmath113 } ) , deleting two edges that share a vertex from part b ( @xmath112-\\{@xmath114 } ) , and deleting two edges that share no vertices ( @xmath112-\\{@xmath115 } ) .",
    "also , in some cases , if we delete a particular edge we can then delete any other without affecting the classification of the resulting graph . for example",
    ", if we delete edge ( b , c ) from @xmath112 , we can then delete any other and still have an intrinsically linked graph ; we will denote graphs obtained in this way by @xmath112-\\{@xmath116}. furthermore , in some cases , we can delete any 2 edges and still have an intrinsically linked graph ; for example , @xmath8 will be intrinsically linked no matter what 2 edges we delete .",
    "we denote these graphs @xmath8 - 2e .",
    "in this section we provide a classification of intrinsically knotted graphs on @xmath6 vertices .",
    "this classification was recently independently presented by blain , bowlin , fleming , foisy , hendricks , and lacombe  @xcite .",
    "graphs on @xmath6 vertices are subgraphs of @xmath117",
    ". we will examine in turn subgraphs which are obtained by removing @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 edges from @xmath117 .",
    "we have already noted that @xmath117 , @xmath120 , and both @xmath121 graphs are intrinsically knotted .",
    "of the five graphs @xmath122 , the three which are intrinsically knotted can all be obtained by removing two edges from @xmath123 .",
    "( see classification of @xmath5-deficient graphs above .",
    "note that @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the same graph . )",
    "there are @xmath126 graphs of the form @xmath127 .",
    "seven of these are not knotted as they can be realized by removing an edge from one of the two unknotted @xmath122 graphs .",
    "the remaining four are intrinsically knotted .",
    "three of these four are of the form @xmath128 .",
