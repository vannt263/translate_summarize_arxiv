    "first , a finite drude weight at @xmath131 in a non - integrable system would be surprising , while on the other hand , this observation is consistent with the fact that thermodynamic properties in the phase are well described by an effective @xmath0 model , @xcite which is believed to have ballistic transport properties in its gapless zero - field phase.@xcite moreover , in the ferromagnetic phase @xmath115 , the physics is expected to be well approximated by a weakly - interacting gas of magnons which in turn renders the drude weight large in relation to the total weight .",
    "we stress that similar to @xmath55 , this is a statement about finite systems and temperatures , and much larger system sizes ( see appendix ) would be required to extrapolate the ratio @xmath126 to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we can therefore not pursue this question here .",
    "note though , that in the high - temperature limit ( @xmath132 ) the magnetic field dependence drops out . in this limit ,",

    "further , we can distinguish a field- and a temperature - dominated regime : qualitatively , at @xmath99 , a variation of the magnetic field influences the conductivities , whereas for @xmath102 , the magnetic field has little effect on both the structure and the weight in the conductivities .",
    "figure  [ fig : i05 ] contains the main result of our work : a field - induced increase in both transport coefficients at low frequencies @xmath133 .",
    "next we turn to the discussion of the influence of the strength of dimerization @xmath76 . since we have presented evidence that the drude weights are the dominant contribution in the field - induced phase , we concentrate on these quantities , expecting them to reflect the main qualitative behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig : drudelam ] shows the spin drude weight as a function of the external magnetic field at different temperatures and strengths of dimerization . in all cases , the drude weight for spin transport exhibits a maximum at intermediate fields .",
    "we expect that in the thermodynamic limit and at sufficiently low temperatures , the transition into the field - induced luttinger phase should lead to signatures in the drude weights at @xmath14 and @xmath15 . yet , for the system sizes we can study , and thus the accessible @xmath77 , the location of the inflection points of @xmath55 do not exhibit a clear correlation with critical fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 of fig .",
