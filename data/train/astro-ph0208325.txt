    "weak gravitational lensing deflects the paths of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons propagating from the surface of last scattering .",
    "one result of this lensing is the transfer of power from large angular scales associated with acoustic - peak structures to small angular scales in the damping tail of the anisotropy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "this transfer only results in a few - percent modification of the power associated with the acoustic - peak structure , and the increase in power along the damping tail is significantly smaller than that generated by secondary anisotropies due to reionization @xcite . to indentify the effect of gravitational lensing on cmb data ,",
    "it is necessary to consider signatures beyond that in the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations .",
    "the existence of non - vanishing higher order cumulants is one such non - gaussian signature lensing can generate . since gravitational lensing conserves surface brightness , cmb fluctuations from lensing are at the second order in temperature fluctuations and result in non - gaussian behavior through non - linear mode coupling . though lensing alone does not lead to a three - point correlation function ,",
    "the correlation between lensing and other secondary anisotropies can lead to such a contribution .",
    "this three - point correlation has been widely discussed in the literature in terms of its fourier - space analogue , the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "weak lensing of the primary anisotropies can produce a four - point correlation due to its non - linear mode - coupling nature @xcite , as can correlations between lensing and secondary effects @xcite .",
    "when probed appropriately through quadratic statistics such as the power spectrum of the squared - temperature map , the trispectrum due to lensing alone can be used for a model - independent recovery of the projected mass distribution out to the last scattering surface @xcite . though these statistics have been shown to be interesting and potentially detectable , measurement of these fourier - based statistics is challenging and techniques are still underdeveloped for this purpose .    here , we discuss real - space moments of the lensed cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "real - space statistics are easily measurable from data .",
    "the only drawbacks are that they are unlikely to be optimal and only provide limited knowledge of the full non - gaussian aspect of the temperature distribution . the first attempts to measure non - gaussianity in the cobe data relied on real - space cumulants @xcite , as will attempts using data from its successor experiments such as map and planck .",
    "this motivates our emphasis here on the real - space cumulants such as the skewness and kurtosis ; we make several remarks on higher - order cumulants as well .    as part of this calculation , we extend a previous discussion of the kurtosis due to lensing in ref .",
    "@xcite and also consider effects related to correlations between lensing and secondary effects such as the sunyave - zeldovich ( sz ; @xcite ) effect .",
    "real - space moments can be derived from the one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) of temperature fluctuations , and can conversely be used to constrain the form of this function . in the case of infinite angular resolution",
    ", we conclude that lensing does not modify the pdf of temperature anisotropies produced at the last scattering surface , which is a reflection on the fact that lensing does not create new power but rather transfers power from large to small angular scales .",
    "the higher - order moments are only generated in a temperature map by finite - resolution effects such as beam smoothing introduced either experimentally or artificially by explicit filtering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : lensing ] , we introduce formalism concerning the weak - lensing approximation and define the bispectrum , trispectrum , and corresponding higher - order quantities . the bispectrum and trispetrum induced in the cmb by lensing and secondary anisotropies are derived in ",

    "can be compared to the cumulative signal - to - noise ratio for the direct detection of the full trispectrum due to lensing , which in the case of planck can be as high as @xmath114 55 @xcite . consequently , although the lensing kurtosis can not be detected directly from the data , lensing effects associated with this kurtosis can be used to reconstruct the lensing deflection angle as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , again with cumulative signal - to - noise ratios significantly greater than that for the kurtosis itself .",
    "the higher signal - to - noise ratio in lensing reconstruction is possible for two reasons . unlike the kurtosis , which averages indiscriminately over all configurations of the trispectrum as shown in eq .",
    "( [ e : sbkt ] ) , lensing reconstruction is sensitive to certain configurations of the trispectrum , mainly those that contribute to the power spectrum of squared temperature .",
    "this avoids severe positive - negative cancellations that significantly reduce the signature of non - gaussianity .",
    "secondly , the noise contribution associated with lensing reconstruction is also _ a priori _ reduced through a filter which is designed to extract information on the lensing potentials optimally .",
    "the low signal - to - noise associated with the kurtosis is also consistent with the fact that real - space moments , in general , suffer from excess noise .",
    "though such statistics are easily measurable in data , they do not provide the most optimal methods to search for the existence of non - gaussian signatures . while we recommend construction of cumulants such as skewness and kurtosis as a first step in understanding non - gaussianity from effects such as lensing",
    ", we suggest that full measures of quantities such as bispectrum and trispectrum will be necessary to fully understand the non - gaussian behavior of lensing .",
    "if measurement of such statistics are still cumbersome , we suggest the use of quadratic statistics in real space , such as the squared - temperature  temperature @xcite and the squared - temperature  squared - temperature @xcite power spectra which probe certain configurations of the bispectrum and trispectrum .    this work was supported in part by nsf ast-0096023 , nasa nag5 - 8506 , and doe de - fg03 - 92-er40701 .",

    "a question arose during the composition of this paper as to the appropriate variance for estimates of the skewness and kurtosis of a gaussian distribution .",
    "the true skewness and kurtosis of a gaussian distribution are necessarily zero , but given @xmath93 data points @xmath115 drawn from this distribution even unbiased estimators will yield results distributed about zero with some variance . some sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicate variances of @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively for the skewness and kurtosis estimators defined in eq .",
    "( [ e : est ] ) as opposed to our values of @xmath118 and @xmath119 . this discrepancy prompted us to investigate further .",
    "the estimators of eq .",
    "( [ e : est ] ) differ from those given in ref .",
    "@xcite in that they are estimators for the third and fourth cumulants rather than the dimensionless skewness and kurtosis to which they are proportional .",
    "assuming an underlying gaussian distribution with a variance of unity , standard propagation of errors reveals that the two pairs of estimators have the same variances to lowest order in @xmath94 .",
    "however , the nave estimators @xmath120 ^ 2 \\ ,   \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] do indeed have variances of @xmath116 and @xmath117 for skewness and kurtosis respectively .",
    "we show this explicitly for the nave skewness estimator @xmath121 .",
    "the ensemble average of this estimator is simply @xmath122 so it is truly an unbiased estimator for the skewness .",
    "however , taking the ensemble average of @xmath123 we find @xmath124 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to a variance @xmath125 for a gaussian distribution , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , implying that this estimator measures skewness with a variance of @xmath116 and is therefore less sensitive than @xmath128 defined in eq .",
    "( [ e : est ] ) which was shown to have a variance of @xmath118 .",
    "an entirely analogous calculation shows that the nave kurtosis estimator in eq .",
    "( [ e : naiveest ] ) has a variance of @xmath117 , not @xmath119",
    ".    why do the estimators of eq .",
    "( [ e : est ] ) outperform those of eq .",
    "( [ e : naiveest ] ) ?",
    "although the true mean of the underlying gaussian distribution has been chosen to be zero , the estimated mean @xmath91 of @xmath93 data points will not necessarily vanish .",
    "the more sophisticated estimators of eq .",
    "( [ e : est ] ) take this into account by subtracting the estimated mean from each data point , and are therefore able to provide lower - variance estimates of the skewness and kurtosis .",
    "these lower values for the variances are adopted for all results concerning signal - to - noise mentioned in this paper .",
