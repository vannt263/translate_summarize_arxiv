    "many organic molecules are able to adopt a large number of different conformations at room temperature which has far reaching consequences for their thermodynamic and biochemical properties . in order to separate rotational and translational degrees of freedom ,",
    "molecular conformations are generally expressed in terms of internal coordinates where it is often sufficient to describe the conformational state of a molecule by a set of dihedral angles since the effect of high - frequency bond angle and length fluctuations can approximately be included in the potential energy @xcite .",
    "dihedral angle coordinates are frequently used to sample molecular conformations in monte carlo simulations of biomolecules ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these thermodynamic simulations are usually based on the assumption that the volume element appearing in the partition function is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 are dihedral angles and @xmath2 is the number of rotatable bonds .",
    "this means that in the absence of atomic interactions all values of dihedral angles are sampled with equal probability . in the present paper",
    "it is shown that this underlying assumption is generally not valid , and that the proper metric in internal coordinate space as well as effects arising from the conformation - dependence of the moment of inertia tensor have to be taken into account in order to accurately calculate thermodynamic quantities .    the main mathematical problem in a formulation of the statistical mechanics in the space of molecular conformations ( which we will call briefly _ shape _",
    "space or shape manifold in the following ) poses the proper separation of _ motions _ in internal coordinates ( or shape coordinates ) and rotations .",
    "this is non - trivial since it is not possible to define a body frame of reference in a unique way as it can be done for a rigid body .",
    "in fact , one can choose an arbitrary coordinate system for each different conformation .",
    "it is known that this freedom in the choice of the coordinate system can be expressed in terms of a gauge potential @xcite where local gauge transforms correspond to independent rotations of coordinate systems , hence the gauge symmetry group is so(3 ) .",
    "an interesting property of systems with internal degrees of freedom is the possibility to generate a change in orientation solely by the variation of shape without the application of an external torque , i.e. , by moving through a closed path in shape space .",
    "the most prominent example for this effect is the ability of a falling cat to land on its feet starting from an upside - down position while the total angular momentum is zero .",
    "another example is the observation of a slow rotation of the whole system over time in zero - angular momentum molecular dynamics simulations of proteins @xcite .",
    "this net rotation of the system is an example of a so - called _ geometric phase _ @xcite which is independent of the parametrization of the closed path in shape space and also gauge - invariant . in the case of three - dimensional molecules the practical calculation of these geometric phases",
    "is complicated by the fact that the group of rotations , so(3 ) , is non - abelian , however , this will not be important for the following discussion .",
    "a deeper mathematical foundation of the subject as well as generalizations can be formulated using fiber - bundles @xcite . from a classical mechanical standpoint",
    "all these rotation - related effects can of course also be discussed in terms of coriolis forces .",
    "a comprehensive recent review on the separation of internal motions and rotations in the @xmath3-body problem ( with emphasis on gauge fields ) has recently been given by littlejohn and reinsch @xcite .",
    "in the following section we discuss the classical canonical partition function in shape space ( its detailed derivation is given in the appendix ) and show that it introduces two shape - dependent correction factors which are not present in the usual cartesian - space partition function involving atom coordinates .",
    "the first factor transforms the volume element in shape coordinates to the true volume element on the non - euclidean shape manifold and involves the metric tensor .",
    "the second term reflects the conformation - dependence of the moment of inertia tensor .",
    "using dihedral angles as shape coordinates the importance of these correction terms is discussed in section 3 for a number of small peptides , ace-(ala)@xmath4-nme with @xmath5 , and the pentapeptide met - enkephalin . in section 4 we estimate and compare the correction terms that arise in the folded and unfolded states of a protein .",
    "we consider a molecule consisting of @xmath3 atoms with masses @xmath6 for which a conformation is uniquely described by @xmath2 shape coordinates @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the cartesian atom coordinates are given as functions of the shape coordinates , @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the vectors @xmath11 are taken to be center of mass coordinates , i.e.  we assume that for all tuples @xmath12 it is @xmath13 .",
    "the choice of the functions @xmath11 is of course not unique because the atom coordinates for a given conformation are only determined up to an overall rotation of the molecule . in fact we could replace the functions @xmath11 by their arbitrarily rotated versions , @xmath14 where the rotation matrix @xmath15 is an arbitrary function of the shape coordinates .",
    "the only assumption we make is , that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are sufficiently well - behaved w.r.t .  the existence of derivatives . because of the shape - dependence of the atom coordinates , the moment of inertia tensor @xmath18 ( appendix eq .",
    "( [ moment_of_inertia ] ) ) is also a function of the shape coordinates .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath18 as a dimensionless quantity , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the thermal de broglie wavelength of atom @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the inverse temperature . here",
    ", @xmath23 denotes the outer product of three - dimensional vectors .",
    "we also define the gauge potential ( see eq .",
    "( [ gauge_potential0 ] ) in the appendix ) @xmath24 which is dimensionless by definition ( assuming that the shape coordinates @xmath7 are dimensionless ) , and the metric tensor @xmath25 on the shape manifold ( appendix eq .",
    "( [ metric_tensor ] ) ) that can be written in a dimensionless form as @xmath26 as discussed in the appendix , infinitesimal distances @xmath27 correspond ( up to a constant prefactor ) to mass - weighted root mean square deviations ( rmsd ) minimized w.r.t .",
    "this fact can in principle be used to approximate distances in shape space without referring to underlying coordinates .",
    "the behavior of the gauge potential @xmath28 under the gauge transform ( [ gauge ] ) is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is defined by the partial derivative of the rotation @xmath15 w.r.t .",
    "the shape coordinates , @xmath31 . with ( [ gauge ] ) and ( [ gauge_transform ] ) it is straightforward to see that the quantity @xmath32 and hence the metric tensor @xmath25 ( see eq .",
    "( [ metric_tensor ] ) in the appendix ) is gauge - invariant , i.e.  independent of the choice of the rotation functions @xmath16 .",
    "as noted in the introduction it can be shown that closed paths in shape space are associated with a change in orientation of the molecule . according to eq .",
    "( [ omega_gauge ] ) in the appendix the ( gauge - dependent ) infinitesimal rotation vector @xmath33 associated with the variation of shape coordinates @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 .",
    "the net rotation @xmath36 generated by moving through a closed path in shape space can be calculated by accumulating these infinitesimal rotations along the path . however , because of the non - abelian nature of the rotation group so(3 ) , i.e.  the fact that rotations do not commute if their rotation axes are different , it is only possible to express @xmath36 in terms of a path - ordered product @xcite . as a measurable quantity , @xmath36 is of course gauge - invariant and also independent of the parametrization of the closed path .",
    "it is possible to derive an explicit expression for @xmath36 in the case of infinitesimal small loops where a generalized version of stokes theorem can be applied @xcite . a consequence of the existence of orientational changes associated with closed loops in shape space is the fact that the shape manifold defined by the metric @xmath25 can not be embedded in the @xmath37-dimensional coordinate space as a single - valued function , i.e.  the shape manifold does not only exhibit curvature but also torsion @xcite .",
    "it is shown in the appendix that the classical canonical partition function @xmath38 in shape space reads @xmath39 where the prefactor @xmath40 stems from the integration over all possible orientations of the molecule .",
    "note , that no translational degrees of freedom have been taken into account in deriving @xmath38 since the atom coordinates @xmath11 are defined as center of mass coordinates . however , because of the separability of center of mass movements in the equation of motion , translational effects can simply be included by an additional prefactor of @xmath38 . in the case of orientational constraints",
    "the prefactor @xmath40 would have to be modified accordingly .",
    "the terms @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be included in the boltzmann factor as effective conformation dependent energy terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 below , we will calculate @xmath43 and @xmath44 for a number of molecules . in the remainder of the paper",
    "it is assumed that the shape coordinates @xmath48 are given by the dihedral angles @xmath49 , where @xmath2 is the number of rotatable bonds .",
    "the effect of the correction factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 becomes visible in the probability distributions @xmath50 of the dihedral angles @xmath51 in the absence of atomic interactions . if the correction factors are omitted in eq .",
    "( [ shape_partition_function ] ) values of the dihedral angles are uniformly distributed with @xmath52 , a fact which is sometimes used to test microreversibility in monte carlo simulations with complicated concerted - rotation move sets @xcite . here , these distributions are given by @xmath53^{1/2 } \\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left[\\det\\tilde{\\bf m}(\\phi_1,\\dots,\\phi_{n-1},\\phi,\\phi_{n+1},\\dots,\\phi_m)\\right]^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54^{1/2 } \\left[\\det\\tilde{\\bf m}(\\phi_1,\\dots,\\phi_m)\\right]^{1/2}.\\ ] ]",
    "in this section we calculate the conformation - dependent correction factors in the partition function ( [ shape_partition_function ] ) and the related quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 at @xmath55 k for the peptides ace-(ala)@xmath56-nme as well as for the pentapeptide met - enkephalin with the sequence tyr - gly - gly - phe - met .",
    "we only consider dihedral angles at fully rotatable bonds ( @xmath57-angles are set to 180@xmath58 ) that do not connect to methyl- or nh@xmath59-groups .",
    "conformations of the polyalanines are parametrized by 2 , 4 , and 6 dihedral angles , while 17 dihedral angles have to be taken into account for met - enkephalin .",
    "potential energies have been calculated with the tinker software package @xcite using the opls all - atom forcefield @xcite ( without electrostatic interaction cut off and with @xmath60 ) in conjunction with a gb / sa implicit - solvent term @xcite .",
    "1 shows the terms @xmath61 and @xmath42 as functions of the dihedral angles @xmath62 and @xmath63 for alanine dipeptide ( ace - ala - nme ) .",
    "it is seen that both terms show relative variations of about 25% and 30% respectively .",
    "the corresponding variations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are 0.17 kcal / mol and 0.21 kcal / mol .",
    "note that only these relative variations matter for the calculation of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the distributions of the effective energies @xmath43 and @xmath44 for ace-(ala)@xmath64-nme and met - enkephalin are shown in fig .  2 , 3 , and 4 , where each point @xmath65 corresponds to a low - energy molecular conformation .",
    "for the polyalanines conformations have been obtained on an equidistant grid in dihedral angle space with grid spacing @xmath66 . in total @xmath67 conformations",
    "have been sampled for ace-(ala)@xmath68-nme , and @xmath69 conformations for ace-(ala)@xmath70-nme . of these conformations ,",
    "2 ( fig .  3 ) shows those 200 ( 1000 ) with the lowest potential energies .",
    "the insets in fig .  2 and 3 give the corresponding cumulative energy distributions .",
    "conformations of the larger and more flexible molecule met - enkephalin can not be obtained by explicit enumeration . in this case",
    "conformations have been generated by randomly choosing dihedral angles and subsequently applying an annealing and energy minimization procedure that uses short stochastic dynamics runs at decreasing temperatures followed by steepest - descend minimization , and thereby mostly avoiding steric clashes and other high - energy situations .",
    "this way , 2000 conformations have been generated , of which those 200 with the lowest potential energies have been plotted in fig .  4 along with the cumulative energy distribution shown in the inset .",
    "it is known that met - enkephalin does not adopt a single conformation in aqueous solution at room temperature @xcite , last but not least because of its biological function as a neuro - transmitter binding to a number of different receptors .",
    "one may therefore expect , that many conformations generated by the procedure described above can actually be assumed by the molecule under biological conditions .",
    "variations @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the energies @xmath43 and @xmath44 in fig .  2 , 3 , and 4 ( here defined by the difference between maximal and minimal values in the data ) strongly",
    "depend on the size of the molecule . while for ace-(ala)@xmath68-nme and ace-(ala)@xmath70-nme these variations are small ( @xmath73 kcal / mol and @xmath74 kcal / mol in the first case , and @xmath75 kcal / mol and @xmath76 kcal / mol in the latter one ) , they become more significant for met - enkephalin , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 vary by @xmath77 kcal / mol and @xmath78 kcal / mol according to the data plotted in fig .",
    "4 . fig .",
    "5 shows those conformations of met - enkephalin that correspond to the numbered data points in fig .  4 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 and therefore @xmath61 and @xmath42 assume extreme values .",
    "clearly , conformations with small factor @xmath42 exhibit a small radius of gyration and are therefore more compact than conformations with large values of this term .",
    "the interpretation of the term @xmath61 is more difficult and its values depend on the details of the molecule .",
    "however , consistent with the pictures shown in fig .",
    "5 it can be said that more `` rigid '' , stretched conformations lead to a smaller factor @xmath61 than `` sloppier '' , curved conformations , where small changes in the dihedral angles result in larger changes in the atom coordinates .",
    "since conformations with large radius of gyration are usually more stretched than those with small radius of gyration we may explain the weak negative correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 indicated by the straight lines ( obtained by a least squares fit ) in fig .  2 , 3 , and 4 ( correlation coefficient @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ) .",
    "we do not find correlations between the potential energy @xmath82 and @xmath43 or @xmath44 except for the case of met - enkephalin , where @xmath82 is negatively correlated with @xmath44 because more compact conformations forming hydrogen bonds or salt bridges are found to be energetically favored by several kcal / mol .",
    "the probability distributions @xmath50 of dihedral angles in the absence of atomic interactions defined in eq .",
    "( [ angle_distribution ] ) can be calculated by first obtaining a series of conformations where all values of dihedral angles are sampled with equal probability .",
    "the histograms @xmath83 approximating @xmath50 , are then given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes an average over the series of conformations , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 being the number of bins ) , and @xmath88 it is @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "6 shows the so - obtained distributions for all 17 dihedral angles of met - enkephalin using @xmath69 randomly sampled conformations .",
    "it is seen that deviations from the uniform distribution @xmath91 of up to 40% occur for some of the dihedral angles ( most prominently for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , where the indices refer to the bond indices shown in fig .",
    "this again demonstrates that the correction factors @xmath61 and @xmath42 are significant for met - enkephalin .",
    "in this section we discuss the terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the context of folded and unfolded states of a protein with radii of gyration @xmath95 and @xmath96 . at first ,",
    "an estimate of @xmath43 is given considering only backbone dihedral angles ( @xmath62 and @xmath63-angles ) with the assumption that the contributions of side chain dihedrals to the metric tensor @xmath25 are roughly the same for folded and unfolded states . in order to calculate the determinant of @xmath25 we have to estimate its eigenvalues @xmath97 .",
    "one may argue , that the corresponding eigenvectors are localized on the peptide chain and span about seven adjacent torsion angles , having in mind that six is the number of angles needed to solve the so - called rebridging problem for polymer chains @xcite .",
    "this means , that there is one free parameter in the concerted motion of seven adjacent @xmath98-angles leaving the rest of the protein unchanged .",
    "we therefore assume that an eigenvector of @xmath25 corresponds to a loop of about seven residues with length @xmath99 and with endpoints @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 be the average distance of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and @xmath103 the length scale of the average lateral fluctuations of such a loop w.r.t .  the axis @xmath104 .",
    "since this is a short loop ( w.r.t . to the persistence length scale ) we estimate the scaling behavior of @xmath103 to be @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath25 should scale as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the mass of the loop , and therefore @xmath108 , where @xmath3 is the number of residues . assuming @xmath109 and taking @xmath102 to be proportional to the radius of gyration we obtain @xmath110.\\ ] ] using a value of 1.6 for the ratio of the radii of gyration in the unfolded and folded states from @xcite , and very roughly estimating @xmath111 from the analysis of c@xmath112 distances of protein structures",
    ", we find @xmath113 kcal / mol at @xmath55 k for a protein with @xmath114 residues .",
    "one may therefore conclude that energy corrections due to the metric of the dihedral angle shape manifold are a significant energetic contribution and should be taken into account in folding simulations using monte carlo moves based on dihedral angles .",
    "we now turn to the term @xmath115 .",
    "since this term arises form the thermal equilibration of angular momentum its contribution is for instance not included in molecular dynamics simulations that enforce @xmath116 for the protein . in order to estimate @xmath44 we have to consider inertial effects of the solvent as well .",
    "while these effects should be negligible for small molecules it is reasonable to assume that in the unfolded state of a globular protein many water molecules are effectively trapped and therefore rigidly coupled . for our estimate",
    "we therefore consider two limiting cases : complete viscous coupling of the solvent ( i.e. neglecting inertial effects of the solvent at all ) and complete rigid coupling , ( i.e.  all solvent molecules in the sphere defined by the radius of gyration @xmath117 are rigidly coupled to the protein ) . in the first case",
    "the components @xmath2 of the diagonalized moment of inertia tensor @xmath18 scale as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the mass of the protein , while in the latter case the mass @xmath107 itself scales as @xmath120 , so that @xmath121 assuming a uniform mass density of protein and solvent . with @xmath122 we derive @xmath123 where @xmath124 in the case of viscously coupled solvent and @xmath125 for rigid coupling . at @xmath55 k we get @xmath126 kcal / mol in the first case and @xmath127 kcal / mol in the second .    note , that @xmath71 and @xmath72 have different signs : unfolded or stretched conformations have a smaller value of @xmath128 because the loops are stiffer and therefore dihedral angle variations result in smaller variations in cartesian space , while the moment of inertia is the larger the larger the characteristic length scale of the molecule is .",
    "this confirms the trend that had already been observed for small molecules discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is seen that @xmath129 is by about a factor of 5 larger than @xmath130 for a protein with 50 residues . while @xmath71 depends linearly on the chain length",
    ", @xmath72 is independent of the size of the protein .",
    "it has been shown in the present paper that statistical mechanical sampling of molecular conformations has to account for the correct metric @xmath25 in conformational space as well as the conformation - dependence of the moment of inertia tensor @xmath131 , both of which can be expressed in terms of effective conformation - dependent energy contributions , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . using dihedral angles as internal coordinates",
    ", the distribution of these energy contributions for low - energy conformations has been calculated numerically for a number of short peptides .",
    "while their influence is small for molecules with few rotatable bonds , we find variations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 of about 2.45 kcal / mol ( for @xmath43 ) and 0.77 kcal / mol ( for @xmath44 ) for the pentapeptide met - enkephalin",
    ". a rough estimate of both terms in the folded and unfolded states of a protein with 50 residues leads to the significant energy difference of 7.5 kcal / mol for @xmath43 and between -0.85 kcal / mol and -2.1 kcal / mol for @xmath44 .",
    "this shows that both correction terms should be taken into account when dihedral coordinates are used in thermodynamic monte carlo simulations of protein folding in order to accurately calculate thermodynamic quantities . since @xmath132 is larger in the unfolded state of a protein , monte carlo simulations that omit these corrections lead to free energy differences between unfolded and folded states that are too small .",
    "these simulations therefore underestimate the stability of the folded state .",
    "the efficient implementation of metric and moment of inertia - related correction terms within a monte carlo algorithm will be subject of a future publication .    a related problem , where the consideration of the proper metric in conformational space is important , is the estimate of thermodynamic quantities from a given , finite ensemble of molecular conformations .",
    "such ensembles can be generated for molecules with not too many rotatable bonds and allow for the calculation of free energies and conformational entropies which are otherwise difficult to access in importance sampling - based methods .",
    "an example is the calculation of protein side chain free energies @xcite from rotamer libraries @xcite . in principle",
    "it is possible to estimate thermodynamic properties such as entropies from any given ensemble of conformations without referring to underlying internal coordinates .",
    "distances according to the metric @xmath25 can be approximated by the mass - weighted rmsd between two conformations minimized w.r.t .",
    "rotations and translations .",
    "however , the calculation of the partition function would then require a triangulation procedure in order to calculate volume elements in conformational space .",
