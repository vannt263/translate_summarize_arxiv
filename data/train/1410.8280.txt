    "section [ xsns ] summarizes the basic concepts of x - ray and neutron scattering , sections [ models ] and [ pdf ] review the models of disordered materials and summarize the pair distribution function method , respectively , and finally a brief review of the crystal structures of lead - zirconate - titanate [ pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 , pzt ] is given in section [ pzt_structures ] .",
    "pzt was chosen as an example material due to its wide use in applications , which are often based on the controlled use of defects .",
    "section [ pzt_case ] describes the numerical method applied in the present study .",
    "section [ cluster_section ] describes the method after which selected case studies on pzt clusters are given in sections [ spherical_section ] , [ ellipsoid_section ] and [ domainsection ] .",

    "the intensity maxima correspond to the reciprocal lattice points @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the reciprocal lattice vectors and @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are integers .",
    "( [ amplitude ] ) can be generalized by replacing the discrete atomic densities by a continuous electron density @xmath22 :    @xmath23    so that @xmath5 is the fourier transform of @xmath22 .",

    "the electron density can be expressed as a convolution between the function representing the electron density inside a unit cell and a series of dirac functions representing the crystal lattice .",
    "fourier - transform of the convolution results in the structure factor @xmath28 and further gives the well - known result according to which the intensity of the reflection @xmath29 is @xmath30 .",
    "section [ pzt_case ] focuses on the nanosize clusters which possess short - range order but lack translational symmetry .",
    "the nanosize itself does not remove the translational symmetry : we consider cases in which each unit cell has own lattice parameters ( i.e. , the assumption of translational symmetry is abandoned ) .",
    "if the absorption , extinction , thermal displacements , angle dependent polarization corrections and instrument related factors are not considered , the elastic scattering intensity can readily be computed from eq .",

    "since x - rays interact with electrons and neutrons interact with nuclei the techniques are in many ways complementary . in contrast to x - rays ,",
    "neutrons frequently scatter strongly from light nuclei , such as oxygen and hydrogen , which is essentially why neutrons suit for the determination of light elements positions .",
    "the neutron scattering lengths of different isotopes are often quite different , even possessing different signs , which has made isotope substitution a technique for pinpointing structural details .",
    "since neutrons possess a magnetic moment they interact with the magnetic moments of electrons , the cross section being the same order of magnitude as the neutron - nuclear interaction .",
    "correspondingly , neutron scattering is the most common method for determining magnetic ordering .",
    "magnetic form factors used in the calculations of the cross sections for magnetic scattering of neutrons are given in terms of sums of exponential functions whose coefficients are tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . the form factors decay with increasing @xmath10 so that often the minimum @xmath34-spacing included in the magnetic scattering model is @xmath35 .",
    "the form factors depend on the valence state of the ions and thus it is frequently necessary to complement neutron scattering data by alternative measurements to clarify the valence state(s ) of the ions .",
    "since the scattering power of atoms for neutrons is not @xmath36-dependent ( @xmath37 ) , in contrast to x - rays where the atomic scattering factors fall away rapidly at high-@xmath36 , strong diffuse scattering can be observed well beyond the @xmath36-range where bragg peaks occur @xcite .",
    "computation of diffraction intensities is straightforward once the positions of atoms are given ( see , for instance refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the most challenging problem is to find the atomic scale structure ( structural model ) corresponding to the measured intensity .",
    "numerous recipes to solve the problem have been developed , for instance see refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "space group symmetry determination from the laue symmetry and the reflection conditions , as obtained from the diffraction patterns , is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the final stage of the structure solving task",
    "one introduces a model which is refined by adjusting model parameters so that the difference between the computed intensity and the measured intensity is minimized . a well - known refinement technique for powders is the rietveld method @xcite . in the case of known average symmetry ,",
    "equation ( [ in ] ) is not applied directly , but one computes the squared value of the absolute value of the structure factor , @xmath38 of the bragg reflection @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath38 , however , tells nothing about the linewidths or the shape of the profile function of the reflection .",
    "numerous line shapes were derived for different instruments and sometimes the choice of the profile function for describing the sample and instrument originating line broadening is challenging .",
    "the broadening parameters are refined as a part of the structural model .",
    "more recently , instrument related line broadening has also been computed from the known diffractometer properties as summarized in ref . @xcite . in principle , direct application of eq .",
    "( [ in ] ) gives the _ sample _ contribution to the lineshape .",
    "direct application of equation ( [ in ] ) is a heavy computational task even for relatively small atom clusters .",
    "generally , the problem is challenging once the material lacks periodicity at least in one dimension as even a straightforward computation of the scattered intensity from a collection of atoms with known positions becomes computationally formidable task ( see , however , model # 5 in section [ models ] ) .",
    "thus , to make structure solving or even refinement possible approximations are required .",
    "the most complex structures require tailored solutions as they do not possess the high symmetry required by the commonly available programs .",
    "[ [ defects - in - solids . ] ] defects in solids .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    defects in solids are classified as zero - dimensional ( point defects ) , one - dimensional ( line defects ) and two - dimensional ( surfaces ) , see fig.[figdefects ] .",
    "examples of point , line and two - dimensional crystal defects , which frequently occur together .",
    "point defects include substitute atoms , vacancies and interstitial atoms and are accompanied by a local strain field .",
    "edge dislocations are common in thin film multilayer structures and occur when the mismatch between the thin film layer and substrate is so large that strain is energetically unfavourable . domains in ferroelectrics and magnetic materials dictate the materials response to external field.,width=453 ]    point defects introduce a change in the scattering power by interfering the coherence between scattered waves by introducing a disturbance to the scattering amplitudes ( or lengths ) and scatterer positions . in diffraction experiments",
    "this effect is hardly seen if the defect concentration is small .",
    "however , once the concentration increases not only is the scattering power changing via change in average @xmath39 ( substitutional disorder ) but also bond lengths and angles are spatially varying ( displacement disorder ) .",
    "mathematical treatment of displacement disorder correlated with substitutional disorder in solid - solutions is given in ref .",
    "phenomenologically the displacement disorder following the substitutional disorder can be described using the concept of microstrain introduced in ref . @xcite and it is commonly used to model the @xmath29-dependent line broadening in rietveld refinement : for instance gsas @xcite rietveld refinement software has an option to use profile functions with microstrain broadening formulated in ref .",
    "table [ defects ] summarizes common disorder types observed in solids and the characteristic signatures in x - ray scattering and diffraction .",
    "the models given in table [ defects ] may appear rather specific .",
    "however , the tabulated signatures are also found in more general cases .",
    "for instance , the signal related to the displacement disorder increases with increasing reflection index and vanishes for small values of @xmath10 .",
    "the signatures can be used for distinguishing different structural models .",
    "for example , both sinusoidal composition modulation and sinusoidal displacement modulation produce satellite reflections at the same @xmath34-spacing , if the propagation vector is the same .",
    "the two cases can be identified by their different intensity dependencies . also",
    "the case of correlated substitutional and displacement disorder can be distinguished from the plain substitutional and plain displacement disorder by the characteristic asymmetric intensity of the satellite peaks of each pair .",
    "we note that the _ pure _ size - related line broadening gives the same particle size estimate , no matter which reflection is chosen . however ,",
    "if the broadening is not solely due to the particle size it is important to correctly model the disorder .",
    "section [ pzt_case ] considers several cases in which non - periodical displacement and substitutional disorder are correlated and the results are found to be consistent with the observations seen in periodically modulated cases .    model # 1 is a common and straightforward way to describe scattering from a well - mixed solid solution formed by not - too - different size constituent elements .",
    "the success of the model # 1 is essentially due to the fact that diffraction tends to emphasize average structure and to suppress deviations from it .",
    "however , if the composition and atomic scattering factors vary periodically , for instance as a sine wave form with a propagation vector @xmath40 , then the bragg peaks ( principal nodes ) are surrounded by satellites at distances @xmath41 of each bragg peak .    in the case of a pure sinusoidal composition variation ( in contrast to displacement disorder models # 3 and # 4 which also exhibit characteristic satellite peaks ) the ratio of the intensity of the satellite reflections to that of the corresponding bragg peak intensity is a constant for all the nodes .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , if atomic scattering factor varies as a sine wave , @xmath42 , then the diffracted wave amplitude is @xmath43+\\frac{f\\eta}{2}\\exp[-2\\pi i(\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{k})\\cdot\\mathbf{x}_n]$ ] .",
    "thus , diffraction pattern exhibits two satellites at distances @xmath41 of each node , with intensities which are @xmath44 times that of the principal node .",
    "model # 2 is a well - known description of the atomic displacement originated diffuse scattering implemented in every standard rietveld refinement software .",
    "model # 5 is based on the generation of a scattering object from two types of layers @xmath45 and @xmath46 with proportions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "layers are added to the lattice one at a time and the probability of the new layer being an @xmath45 or @xmath46 type is dependent only on the preceding layer @xcite .",
    "the scattering object is constructed using conditional probabilities @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 ( 0 ) denotes that the site is occupied by an @xmath45 ( @xmath46)-type layer . in the case of an infinite number of layers",
    "rather simple expression is obtained for the diffuse intensity , see model # 5 in table [ defects ] .",
    "model # 5 is an example of a model suitable for describing a layer - by - layer crystal growth .",
    "contemporary growth chambers are often equipped with the _ in situ _ monitoring facilities , such as reflection high energy electron diffraction facility allowing to ensure the growth of correct type of layers @xcite .",
    "optimization of growth parameters includes the adjustment of substrate temperature , gas atmosphere ( e.g. , oxygen gas pressure ) and deposition rate related parameters ( such as laser beam fluence in pulsed laser ablation deposition or sputtering power ) . during _ in situ _ monitoring one observes the diffraction pattern and , if required , conducts parameter adjustment until a correct phase is formed . in the case of a single layer",
    "it is rather straightforward to observe when a correct diffraction pattern emerges .",
    "model # 5 and their extensions are amenable for _ in situ _ modelling of multilayer thin film structures consisted of stacked thin layers possessing different types of layers .

    "[ domains ] illustrates the structural model .",
    "the cases treated below possess complex combination of displacement disorder ( when the boundary halves the particle , left - hand side domain can be obtained from the right - hand side domain by atomic displacements ) and substitutional disorder .",

    "the cation positions are relaxed so that the bond - valence sum criteria is fulfilled .",
    "in contrast to many standard models , the two domains are not considered separately ; instead the scattering intensity is computed for the _ entire cluster_. the purpose of the simulation is to show that ( i ) domain structure has a significant impact on the scattering intensity , ( ii ) the method suits for _ in - situ _ modelling ( e.g. , polarization reversal studies ) , ( iii ) the impact of different elements can be isolated and ( iv ) certain reflections can no more be described by a single asymmetric peak , even if they would originally correspond to a single symmetric peak .",
    "two domains types , referred to as t- and r - domains , are considered . in the t - domain",
    "the domain wall is perpendicular to the @xmath58 direction and in the case of the r - domain the wall is perpendicular to the @xmath59 direction .",
    "the presence of t- and r - domains is most evidently revealed as a split of the @xmath60-type reflections .",

    "scattering geometry and the nature of the incident radiation ( for instance , x - rays or polarized or unpolarized neutron beams ) affects the observed scattering intensity .",
    "the simplest correction is the diffraction geometry dependent lorentz factor @xmath76 , a trigonometric factor due to the fact that different reflections stay different times at the reflection position . in the case of a constant angular speed and single crystal sample @xmath76",
    "is @xmath77 ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for powders",
    "the prevailing measurement geometry is the bragg - brentano , or @xmath78 geometry , in which the sample is rotated at constant speed .",
    "if one assumes that the incident beam probes large set of randomly oriented crystals a further geometrical factor @xmath79 is required as only a fraction of the crystals are in a reflection position with respect to the detector .",
    "the lorentz factor is the same for x - rays and neutrons .",
    "thus , the neutron scattering intensities computed through eq.([in ] ) were multiplied by a factor    @xmath80    in the case of x - rays one needs a further correction to take the polarization of x - rays into account .",
    "typically x - rays emerging from a x - ray tube are unpolarized , and after reflecting from the diffracting plane the component of the electric field parallel to the plane is not attenuated , whereas the electric field component perpendicular to the diffracting plane is attenuated by a factor of @xmath81 , so that the total intensity is reduced by a polarization factor @xmath82 .",
    "monochromators affect the polarization factor and modified expressions for @xmath83 are required : @xmath84 when a monochromator for an incident beam is used @xcite .",
    "@xmath85 is a constant typically close to unity .",
    "the effect of lorentz and polarization corrections is typically put together and expressed as the @xmath86 factor , which multiplies the scattering power or , in the case of crystals , @xmath38 . in this study",
    "the x - ray scattering intensities were multiplied by a factor    @xmath87",
    "instrument also affects the observed lineshape .",
    "when the scattering power is computed by equation ( [ in ] ) as a function of @xmath88 for a chosen direction of @xmath10 , the cluster size and shape dictates the linewidths and , if the cluster is small , is almost entirely responsible for the broadening .",
    "in contrast , when the intensity for a specific reflection is computed as @xmath38 , a specific peak profile must be assumed .",
    "typically , one needs to consider the sample size and shape , possible defects causing symmetric and asymmetric broadening , and the instrumental contribution as is done in conventional rietveld refinement .",
    "the functions describing different contributions are convoluted , which is computationally heavy task .",
    "correspondingly , a large number of different types of profile functions have been introduced to model different cases ."
