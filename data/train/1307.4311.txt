    "landweber iteration is one of the most well - known regularization methods for solving inverse problems formulated in hilbert spaces .",
    "a complete account on this method for linear inverse problems can be found in @xcite including the convergence analysis and its various accelerated versions .",
    "a nonlinear version of landweber iteration was proposed in @xcite for solving nonlinear inverse problems , where an elegant convergence analysis was present .",
    "although landweber iteration converges slowly , it still receives a lot of attention because it is simple to implement and is robust with respect to noise .",
    "the classical landweber iteration in hilbert spaces , however , has the tendency to over - smooth solutions which makes it difficult to capture the special features of the sought solutions such as sparsity and piecewise constancy .",
    "it is therefore necessary to reformulate this method either in banach space setting or in a manner that modern non - smooth penalty functionals , such as the @xmath0 and total variation like functionals , can be incorporated .",
    "let @xmath1 be a linear compact operator between two banach spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 with norms @xmath4 whose dual spaces are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "some recent advances on landweber iteration for linear inverse problems @xmath7 in banach space setting have been reported using only the noisy data @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 with a small known noise level @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath2 is uniformly smooth and uniformly convex , by virtue of the duality mappings , a version of landweber iteration for solving ( [ linear ] ) was proposed in @xcite .",
    "although the method excludes the use of the @xmath0 and total variation like penalty functionals , new ideas were introduced in @xcite which promote the study of landweber iteration in modern setup .",
    "recently a version of landweber iteration was proposed in @xcite using non - smooth uniformly convex penalty functionals .",
    "let @xmath11 $ ] be a proper , lower semi - continuous , uniformly convex functional , then the method in @xcite reads as @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the adjoint of @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 is the duality mapping of @xmath3 with gauge function @xmath17 , @xmath18 are suitable chosen step - lengths , and @xmath19 denotes the duality pairing between @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "the method ( [ land2 ] ) reduces to the one in @xcite when taking @xmath20 with @xmath21 . however , ( [ land2 ] ) has more freedom on @xmath22 so that it can be used to detect special features of solutions .",
    "the convergence analysis of ( [ land2 ] ) is given in @xcite when it is terminated by the discrepancy principle @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the argument in @xcite , however , requires that @xmath25 , the interior of @xmath26 , must be non - empty and that ( [ linear ] ) must have a solution in @xmath25 .",
    "these conditions are indeed quite restrictive ; for instance , the domain of the total variation like functional @xmath27 with @xmath28 over the space @xmath29 on a bounded domain @xmath30 does not have any interior point in @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the total variation of @xmath33 over @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the theoretical result in @xcite can not be applied to this important penalty functional .",
    "it is natural to ask if the convergence of ( [ land2 ] ) can be proved without assuming @xmath35 .",
    "an affirmative answer would theoretically justify the applicability of ( [ land2 ] ) to a wider class of penalty functionals @xmath22 including the total variation like functionals .",
    "the control of @xmath36 presents one of the major challenges . the analysis in @xcite",
    "is based on proving the boundedness of @xmath36 in @xmath5 which consequently enforces to assume that @xmath35 .",
    "we observe that the boundedness of @xmath36 is not essential in the convergence analysis , the most essential ingredient is to control @xmath37 for any solution @xmath38 of ( [ linear ] ) . due to the lack of monotonicity on the residual @xmath39",
    ", it turns out to be difficult to consider @xmath37 for all @xmath40 .",
    "fortunately , with a careful chosen subsequence @xmath41 of integers , we can derive what we expect on @xmath42 which together with some monotonicity results enables us to prove a stronger result , i.e. @xmath43 converges to a solution of ( [ linear ] ) in bregman distance .",
    "instead of considering ( [ land2 ] ) for solving ( [ linear ] ) directly , we consider a more general setup in which ( [ land2 ] ) is extended for solving linear as well as nonlinear inverse problems . instead of studying a single equation",
    ", we consider the system @xmath44 consisting of @xmath45 equations , where , for each @xmath46 , @xmath47 is an operator between two banach spaces @xmath2 and @xmath48 .",
    "such systems arise naturally in many practical applications including various tomography techniques using multiple exterior measurements . by introducing @xmath49 and @xmath50 the system ( [ sys0 ] ) could be reformulated as a single equation @xmath51 .",
    "one might consider extending ( [ land2 ] ) to solve @xmath52 directly .",
    "this procedure , however , becomes inefficient if @xmath45 is large because it destroys the special structure of ( [ sys0 ] ) and results in an equation requiring huge memory to save the intermediate computational results .",
    "therefore , it seems advantageous to use the kaczmarz - type methods , which cyclically consider each equation in ( [ sys0 ] ) separately and hence require only reasonable memory consumption .",
    "some landweber - kaczmarz methods were formulated in @xcite for solving the system ( [ sys0 ] ) when @xmath2 and @xmath48 are hilbert spaces , and the numerical results indicate that artefacts can appear in the reconstructed solutions due to oversmoothness .",
    "recently a landweber - kaczmarz method was proposed in @xcite for solving ( [ sys0 ] ) in banach space setting in the spirit of @xcite and hence the possible use of the @xmath0 and total variation like penalty functionals is excluded .",
    "furthermore , the convergence analysis in @xcite unfortunately contains an error ( see the first line on page 12 in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose a landweber iteration of kaczmarz type in which ( [ land2 ] ) is adapted to solve each equation in ( [ sys0 ] ) and thus general non - smooth uniformly convex penalty functionals @xmath22 are incorporated into the method with the hope of removing artefacts and of capturing special features of solutions .",
    "we give the detailed convergence analysis of our method .",
    "it is worthy pointing out that our analysis does not require the interior of @xmath26 be nonempty and therefore the convergence result applies for the total variation like penalty functionals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some preliminary results from convex analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "we first formulate the landweber iteration of kaczmarz type with general uniformly convex penalty term for solving the system ( [ sys0 ] ) , and then present the detail convergence analysis . in section 4",
    "we give the proof of an important proposition which plays an important role in section 3 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present some numerical simulations on tomography problems in imaging and parameter identification in partial differential equations to test the performance of the method .",
    "let @xmath2 be a banach space with norm @xmath4 .",
    "we use @xmath5 to denote its dual space , and for any @xmath53 and @xmath54 we write @xmath55 for the duality pairing .",
