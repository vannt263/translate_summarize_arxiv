    "control - based continuation is a systematic method for performing bifurcation studies on physical experiments .",
    "based on modern feedback control schemes it enables dynamical phenomena to be detected and tracked as system parameters are varied in a similar manner to how nonlinear numerical models can be investigated using numerical continuation .",
    "control - based continuation was originally developed as an extension to pyragas time - delayed feedback control  @xcite to make it more robust and suitable for parameter studies  @xcite , though its current implementation contains no elements of time - delayed feedback .",
    "the use of feedback control for the investigation of nonlinear systems is not new ; in addition to time - delayed feedback , methods such as ogy control  @xcite have previously been employed to provide non - invasive control to stabilise unstable orbits and investigate dynamical phenomena .",
    "indeed , previous authors have gone as far as to implement such control schemes within parameter continuation studies to numerically simulate particular experiments such as atomic force microscopes  @xcite or reaction kinetics  @xcite .",
    "control - based continuation goes beyond these particular methods to allow the use of almost any feedback control scheme and , as such , it is a general purpose tool applicable to a wide range of physical experiments .",
    "control - based continuation has been successfully applied to a range of experiments including a parametrically excited pendulum  @xcite , nonlinear energy harvesters  @xcite and a bilinear oscillator  @xcite . in each case",
    ", periodic orbits have been tracked through instabilities such as saddle - node bifurcations ( folds ) thus revealing a great deal of dynamical information about the system in question , including the location of a codimension-2 cusp bifurcation in one case  @xcite . as well as bifurcations , other dynamic features such as backbone curves",
    "can also be tracked with control - based continuation  @xcite .    although the basic scheme for control - based continuation is well established ( an overview is provided in sec .  [",
    "sec : cbc ] ) , it lacks many of the features of standard numerical continuation schemes such as bifurcation detection",
    ". only saddle - node bifurcations ( folds ) can be detected readily and that is because they are geometric features in the solution surface .",
    "bifurcations such as period - doubling bifurcations are not geometric features and can go undetected due to the stabilising affect of the feedback controller .    in this paper",
    "we consider only periodically forced systems and hence study periodic orbits , though there is no reason that the methods developed should not be applicable to autonomous systems as well . in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] , we propose a method for calculating the stability ( the floquet multipliers and associated stable and unstable eigendirections ) based on the estimation of a local linearisation around a stabilised periodic orbit .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in sec .",
    "[ sec : apparatus ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] by applying it to a ( physical ) nonlinear mass - spring - damper system where the nonlinearity is geometric in nature  the springs are mounted perpendicular to the direction of motion .",
    "numerical continuation is a path following method used to track solution branches as parameters of the system in question are varied . in a nonlinear system",
    ", these solution branches can encounter bifurcations at particular parameter values which results in a qualitative change in the dynamics of the system .",
    "numerical continuation enables these bifurcations to be detected and tracked in turn .",
    "it is typically applied to differential equation models but it can be used more widely , for example on finite element models .    at a basic level , numerical continuation tracks the solutions of an arbitrary nonlinear function , a _ zero problem _ given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the system state and @xmath2 is the system parameter(s ) .",
    "numerical continuation works in a predictor - corrector fashion ; at each step a new solution @xmath3 is predicted from previously determined solutions and then the solution is corrected using a nonlinear root finder applied to the function @xmath4 ( typically a newton iteration ) .",
    "the use of a nonlinear root finder means that the stability or instability of solutions is unimportant . in certain circumstances ( for example , near a fold or saddle - node bifurcation )",
    "the function @xmath4 must be augmented with an additional equation  the pseudo - arclength equation  which enables the numerical continuation scheme to track solution curves that double back on themselves . in these circumstances , without the pseudo - arclength equation the correction step for a fixed set of parameter values @xmath2 will fail since no solution exists . for extensive information and guidance on numerical continuation see the textbooks  @xcite .",
    "numerical software is also readily available in the form of coco  @xcite and auto  @xcite amongst others .",
    "control - based continuation is a means for defining a zero - problem based on the outputs of a physical experiment , thus enabling numerical continuation to be applied directly without the need for a mathematical model . to do this",
    "there are two key challenges to overcome .",
    "1 ) in general , it is not possible to set the state @xmath1 of the physical system and so it is not possible to evaluate @xmath4 at arbitrary points .",
    "2 ) the physical system must remain around a stable operating point while the experiment is running .",
    "while a numerical model going unstable might prove to be a mild annoyance , a physical system going unstable can prove dangerous .    in order to overcome these challenges ,",
    "a feedback controller is used to stabilise the system and the control target ( or reference signal ) acts as a proxy for the system state .",
    "non - invasive , that is , the controller does not affect the locations of any invariant sets in the experiment such as equilibria or period orbits .",
    "this requirement for non - invasiveness defines the zero problem ; a control target must be chosen such that the control action @xmath5    in this paper , we consider the case of a periodically forced experiment and , as such , only consider periodic motions . in this case",
    "it is appropriate to consider a fourier discretisation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : control_zero ] ) and so find the coefficients of the fourier series of the control target .",
    "( in other circumstances different discretisations may be appropriate . )",
    "@xmath6    to solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cbc_zero ] ) standard root finding algorithms can be used , however , any required derivatives must be estimated using finite differences from experimental data .",
    "consequently , gradient - based methods can be slow despite their good convergence rates .",
    "in previous publications a newton - broyden method , which avoids recomputing derivative information for successive iterates , has proven effective  @xcite .    in this paper , since the control acts through the same mechanism as the forcing , we are able to use a quicker method which exploits the fact that we are performing a parameter study in the forcing amplitude  @xcite .",
    "consider the case where the total input to the system is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the forcing signal the case of sinusoidal forcing where @xmath9    for an arbitrary control target , the fourier coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : u_fourier ] ) will be non - zero .",
    "however , the contribution in the fundamental mode ( coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) can be lumped together with the coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the forcing term giving a new effective forcing amplitude of @xmath14 in essence , instead of setting the forcing amplitude and trying to calculate the correct corresponding control target , we set the control target and measure the corresponding forcing amplitude .",
    "though this procedure leaves the @xmath15 and the higher harmonics untouched , the corresponding control target coefficients required to set the control action to zero can be quickly determined using a fixed - point iteration . in an iterative manner",
    "the remaining coefficients of the control target @xmath16 are simply set equal to the measured coefficients of the system response @xmath17 , the iteration finishes when the response and the control target remain equal for a certain period of time . for the system described below",
    ", this takes a single iteration .",
    "a fixed - point iteration can not be applied to the coefficients of the fundamental mode since , generically , instabilities in the system will manifest in the fundamental mode .",
    "for a typical ordinary differential equation model , the floquet multipliers and hence stability of a periodic orbit are determined by integrating over one period the first variational equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the deviation from    in the context of control - based continuation , even determining whether an orbit is stable or unstable is problematic due to the presence of stabilising feedback control . in @xcite a number of measures are suggested to overcome this problem but all require turning off the feedback control for a period of time ; in many situations this is not desirable as damage could be caused to the experiment or even the experimenter . as such , here",
    "we attempt to fit a time - varying linearisation using techniques from the system identification community . from the fitted time - varying linearisation we are able to calculate the corresponding floquet multipliers and hence the stability properties of the periodic orbit .    rather than try to fit a continuous time model of the response to perturbations such as eq .",
    "( [ eqn : variational ] ) , which requires the estimation of derivatives from experimental data , we instead fit the coefficients of a discrete - time multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) auto - regressive model with exogenous inputs ( arx ) of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21_{i=0\\ldots m-1}$ ] , @xmath22_{i=0\\ldots m-1}$ ] and @xmath23_{i=0\\ldots m-1}$ ] are vectors of data points of the perturbed system response , the perturbed system input ( due to the control action and an additional random perturbation ) and the model error respectively , sampled across a single period of oscillation and @xmath24 is the backward shift operator  ( * ? ? ?",
    "thus @xmath25 corresponds to a discretisation of the perturbed system response using @xmath26 points over the period ; this discretisation is illustrated in fig .",

    "( [ eqn : arx ] ) allows the construction of a linear period map from @xmath39 to @xmath40 . ]    at each point we assume linear observability to state that the next point in the time evolution of the linearisation is determined entirely by the previous @xmath41 points alone .",
    "we assume that @xmath42 ( increase the value of @xmath26 as appropriate ) to obtain a banded matrix structure for @xmath27 of @xmath43 and for @xmath28 @xmath44 thus the system identification procedure must identify the @xmath45 coefficients to fully identify the linear model .",
    "the optimal values for @xmath26 and @xmath41 can be estimated using the akaike information criterion ( aic )  @xcite or similar .",
    "note that while increasing @xmath41 increases the data requirements for successful system identification , increasing @xmath26 does not since more information is taken from the existing time series .",
    "since the experiment is operating in closed loop , the number of available system identification methods is somewhat limited . in this paper",
    "we make use of the direct method for closed - loop identification due to its simplicity however , other methods such as joint input - output identification can be used if required  @xcite . in order to provide sufficiently informative results for system identification purposes",
    ", the random perturbation should have a sufficiently broadband spectrum .",
    "however , to minimise extraneous noise ( that is , random perturbations which are not captured by the discretisation ) the bandwidth of the random perturbation should be less than the nyquist frequency corresponding to the discretisation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : arx ] ) .    must be estimated using a method such as the prediction error method ( pem ) since the straightforward use of linear least - squares will result in bias  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) .",
    "however , linear least - squares provides a quick and effective way of starting the iterative pem optimisation .",

    "corresponds to the first @xmath41 rows and @xmath41 columns of the matrix given by @xmath46 and the floquet multipliers of the periodic orbit are the eigenvalues of @xmath47 .",
    "in addition to the floquet multipliers , the eigenvectors of @xmath47 correspond to the stable and unstable directions of the periodic orbit at a particular point in the oscillation .",
    "to test the effectiveness of this methodology outlined in this paper we apply control - based continuation to a nonlinear tuned mass damper ( ntmd ) similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "the ntmd consists of a mass able to move horizontally on a low friction bearing system while restrained by two springs that are mounted perpendicularly to the direction of motion , thus providing a geometric nonlinearity .",
    "the ntmd is then excited at the base .",
    "this configuration results in a hardening spring - type characteristic . a photograph of the experiment is shown in fig .  [ fig : exp](a ) along with a schematic of the experiment in fig .  [ fig : exp](b ) .",
    "the details of the actuation and measurement equipment are as follows .",
    "the ntmd is excited using an aps-113 long - stroke electrodynamic shaker in current control mode using a maxon ads-50/10 - 4qdc motor controller .",
    "typical base displacements are sinusoidal with a frequency ranging from @xmath48@xmath49 and an amplitude ranging from @xmath50@xmath51 .",
    "the peak response amplitude is limited to @xmath52 ; at resonance , this limitation restricts the amplitude of the base motion to approximately @xmath53 .",
    "the motion of the base and the moving mass are measured using laser displacement sensors ( an omron zx2-ld100 and an omron zx1-ld300 respectively ) .",
    "in addition to the displacement measurements , the force provided by the shaker is measured using an mcl - type load cell .    for the real - time control , a linear proportional - derivative ( pd ) controller",

    "the methodology is relatively insensitive to the control gains used provided they are sufficient to stabilise any unstable orbits that are encountered .",

    "all measurements are made at @xmath54 with no filtering .",

    "<S> control - based continuation is technique for tracking the solutions and bifurcations of nonlinear experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is to apply the method of numerical continuation to a feedback - controlled physical experiment . since in an experiment it is not ( generally ) possible to set the state of the system directly , the control target is used as a proxy for the state . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge then becomes to determine a control target such that the control is non - invasive , that is , it stabilises a steady - state ( or periodic orbit ) of the original open - loop experiment without altering it otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> once implemented , control - based continuation enables the systematic investigation of the bifurcation structure of a physical system , much like if it was numerical model </S>",
    "<S> . however , stability information ( and hence bifurcation detection and classification ) is not readily available due to the presence of stabilising feedback control . </S>",
    "<S> this paper uses methods from the system identification community to extract stability information in the form of floquet multipliers from the closed - loop experiment , thus enabling the direct detection of bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is shown that a periodic auto - regressive model with exogenous inputs ( arx ) can be constructed that approximates the time - varying linearisation of the experiment around a particular periodic orbit . </S>",
    "<S> this method is demonstrated using a physical nonlinear tuned mass damper .    numerical continuation , bifurcation theory , system identification , feedback control </S>"
