    "there have been a number of investigations of the force exerted on a charged particle by an aharonov - bohm flux line .",
    "classically , of course , there is no force , so it , like the aharonov - bohm effect itself , is essentially quantum mechanical , vanishing as @xmath2 .",
    "olariu & popescu ( 1983 , 1985 ) show that for certain localized wavepackets ( these are the fast wavepackets described in below ) , the force , along with the momentum it imparts , is negligible unless the centre of the wavepacket hits the flux line .",
    "nielson and hedegrd ( 1995 ) and shelankov ( 2000 ) compute matrix elements of the force operator for stationary states of the same energy .",
    "shelankov ( 1998 ) calculates the transverse force on a stationary incident beam of finite angular width using a paraxial approximation , a result we refer to as _ shelankov s",
    "formula_. this use of the paraxial approximation has been justified by berry ( 1999 ) , who computes the asymptotic deflection of the beam from an exact representation .",
    "peshkin ( 1981 , 1989 ) computes the expectation value of the force when the flux line is enclosed in an impenetrable cylinder .",
    "recent interest in this problem has been stimulated by the analogy with the iordanskii force ( iordanskii 1966 ) exerted on phonons by a vortex in a superfluid ( see , eg , sonin 1975 , sonin 1997 , thouless 1997 , stone 1999 ) , which has been the subject of some recent debate .    in this paper",
    "we add to these investigations in several ways .",
    "first , we obtain exact expressions for the lorentz force operator due to an aharonov - bohm flux line and its matrix elements between arbitrary stationary states ; the restriction to on - shell matrix elements , between stationary states of the same energy , agrees with previous results .",
    "we also obtain an exact expression for the time integral of the force , the impulse operator , and compute its expectation values for various kinds of wavepackets .",
    "we show that the force operator can be simply derived , formally at least , from purely kinematic considerations , and give a mathematically rigorous demonstration to justify the results obtained in this way .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we give a formal derivation of the ( vector ) lorentz force operator due to an aharonov - bohm flux line . pointing out that the nominal magnetic field operator , @xmath3 , is incompatible with gauge invariance ,",
    "we show that that a modification of the canonical commutation relations restores gauge invariance and yields the lorentz force .",
    "an explicit formula for the expectation value for stationary states follows directly . on -",
    "shell matrix elements between stationary states of the same energy are seen to coincide with previous results .",
    "the transverse component of the force is shown to coincide with shelankov s formula in the paraxial limit ( see also shelankov ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "we then compute ( ) the impulse operator , the integral of the force operator in infinite forward and backward time , in the position representation . in",
    "we compute the leading - order expectation value of the impulse for two kinds of wavepackets . for slow wavepackets ( ) , which spread more quickly than they move",
    ", the impulse is inversely proportional to the initial distance between the wavepacket and the flux line , with magnitude and direction depending periodically on the flux parameter @xmath1 . by treating the deflection of a slow wavepacket as a classical scattering",
    ", we obtain an expression for the scattering cross - section which , surprisingly , coincides with the exact result . fast wavepackets ( ) move more quickly than they spread , so much so that the fractional increase in their width as they pass the flux line is small . in this case , the impulse is proportional to the transverse probability density at the flux line , and its transverse component gives a wavepacket analogue of shelankov s formula .    in the appendix , we give a rigorous derivation of the force and impulse expectation values for a class of well - behaved wavefunctions . in ,",
    "we compute matrix elements of the force operator for two standard regularizations of the aharonov - bohm flux line , the first where the flux is enclosed in an impenentrable cylinder , and the second where it is distributed uniformly in a cylindrical tube .",
    "the aharonov - bohm results of and   are recovered in the limit that the radius of the cylinder goes to zero .",
    "consider a particle of charge @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 moving in the @xmath6-plane in a magnetic field along @xmath7 .",
    "quantum mechanically , the particle is described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the kinetic momentum and @xmath10 is the vector potential .",
    "the force , ie the rate of change of the kinetic momentum , is given by the appropriately symmetrized lorentz force operator , @xmath11 =   \\frac{e}{2c}\\left ( { { \\bi v}}\\wedge ( b{\\,\\hat{{{\\bi z } } } } ) -   ( b{\\,\\hat{{{\\bi z}}}})\\wedge { { \\bi v}}\\right),\\ ] ] where the magnetic field operator is defined by @xmath12.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "the usual commutation relations for position and canonical momentum lead to the usual relation between the magnetic field and the vector potential , namely @xmath14 .    however , this relation is incorrect for the vector potential of an aharonov - bohm flux line ( since we are restricting to the plane , we should perhaps say ` flux point ' , but we will follow conventional usage ) . for a flux line at the origin of strength @xmath15 , and in a circularly symmetric gauge ,",
    "the vector potential is given by @xmath16 as is well known , physically meaningful quantities depend only on the fractional part , @xmath17 , of the flux parameter , @xmath1 ; a unit shift in the flux parameter , @xmath18 , is equivalent to the gauge transformation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 as a consequence , a physically observable operator @xmath21 which depends on the flux parameter must transform under @xmath22 according to @xmath23 for example , the kinetic momentum @xmath24 satisfies this relation , as is easily verified . as the magnetic field operator ( [ eq:2 ] ) is expressed in terms of the commutator of components of kinetic momentum , it must also satisfy ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath25 , which is given by @xmath26 , clearly does not satisfy ( [ eq:6 ] ) ; it is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath22 ( like any operator which depends only on position ) , but is not periodic in @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that substituting @xmath27 for the magnetic field in ( [ eq:1 ] ) can not give the correct expression for the lorentz force operator .",
    "the problem is caused , of course , by the singularity at @xmath28 , and can be avoided by an explicit calculation of the time rate of change of the expectation value of the kinetic momentum for suitably chosen wavefunctions .",
    "this is done in the appendix .",
    "however , we can obtain the same result more easily and more directly from formal arguments .",
    "if the usual canonical commutation relations lead to a magnetic field operator which does not transform correctly under gauge transformations , then the canonical commutation relations must be modified by the flux line . in particular , we show below that , formally , the components of the canonical momentum , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , do not commute  equivalently , the partial derivatives @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not commute  in the presence of nonzero flux .",
    "first , we note that the partial derivatives @xmath31 and @xmath32 certainly commute when applied to smooth wavefunctions .",

    "this implies , formally , the operator relation @xmath41 = 2 \\pi \\delta^2({{\\bi r } } ) \\partial_\\phi,\\ ] ] or , equivalently , @xmath42 = -2\\pi \\rmi \\hbar \\delta^2({{\\bi r } } ) l,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the canonical angular momentum .",
    "using the modified commutation relation ( [ eq:4 ] ) to evaluate the magnetic field operator ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we get , instead of the classical relation @xmath44 , the result @xmath45 +    ( \\nabla\\wedge { { \\bi a}})_z    = -\\frac{\\phi_0}{\\hbar } \\delta^2({{\\bi r}})\\lambda,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the kinetic angular momentum .",
    "it is evident that @xmath47 , and hence @xmath48 , satisfy the transformation law ( [ eq:6 ] ) .    throughout this and",
    "the following sections , it will be convenient to represent vectors in the @xmath6-plane as complex scalars . for example , @xmath49 will be represented by @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath51 is a vector of hermitian operators ( as opposed to real scalars ) , then @xmath52 is the nonhermitian scalar operator whose hermitian and antihermitian parts are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively . in this way , the kinetic momentum @xmath24 is represented by the scalar operator @xmath55 it is useful to note that , in general , @xmath56 is represented by @xmath57 .",
    "we proceed to compute the expectation value of the lorentz force . substituting ( [ eq:15 ] ) for the magnetic field and ( [ eq:13 ] ) for the kinetic momentum into the expression ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we get @xmath58\\psi(r,\\phi)r\\,\\rmd r , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath59 . with @xmath60",
    "resolved into its angular momentum components , @xmath61 the integrals in ( [ eq:14 ] ) are trivially evaluated ( note that @xmath62 ) , with the result @xmath63_{r = 0}.\\ ] ] like any vector operator , @xmath64 couples only consecutive angular momentum components , @xmath35 and @xmath65 , and , as one would expect , depends only on the behaviour of the wavefunction at the flux line . for well - behaved wavefunctions , the leading - order behaviour of @xmath66 as @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 sufficient conditions for ( [ eq : r=0 ] ) are discussed in the appendix .",
    "here , we note that ( [ eq : r=0 ] ) ensures that the energy density , @xmath69 , is finite at @xmath70 . substituting ( [ eq : r=0 ] ) into ( [ eq : f2 ] ) , we get @xmath71    the terms in the sum ( [ eq : f2two ] ) vanish unless @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the integer part of the flux parameter .",
    "thus , only the ` pinioned ' components of the wavefunction , @xmath74 and @xmath75  those whose angular momentum quantum numbers are nearest the flux parameter @xmath1  contribute to the force expectation value ( [ eq : f2 ] ) . from  ( [ eq : f2two ] ) , @xmath76 or , equivalently , @xmath77 where the state @xmath78 corresponds to the singular wavefunction @xmath79 so that @xmath80 .",
    "it is readily verified that the force operator ( [ eq : forceop ] ) transforms according to  ( [ eq:6 ] ) under the gauge transformation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the expectation value ( [ eq : fexpect ] ) for suitably chosen wavefunctions is given in the appendix .    in the preceding derivation",
    ", the force operator due to a flux line , like the force for a nonsingular potential , is derived from kinematics , specifically from the commutation relations .",
    "the derivation does not require the solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to generalize to the case of more than one flux line ( for which solutions of the schrdinger equation are , in general , not available ) ; the force operator is just a sum of contributions ( [ eq : forceop ] ) centred around each flux line .",
    "however , to calculate the force on stationary states , or the time dependence of the force on nonstationary states , it is necessary to solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "as is well known , eigenstates of the aharonov - bohm hamiltonian with energy @xmath81 and angular momentum @xmath82 are given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a bessel function . from the small-@xmath85 behaviour , @xmath86 , and the reflection formula , @xmath87",
    ", we obtain from ( [ eq : forceop ] ) the matrix elements @xmath88 for @xmath89 , ie for stationary states with the same energy , we obtain the on - shell matrix elements @xmath90 in agreement with results of nielson and hedegrd ( 1995 ) and shelankov ( 2000 ) .",
    "a general stationary state @xmath91 is a superposition of eigenstates with @xmath0 fixed , and may be taken to be of the form @xmath92 for @xmath93 , @xmath94 corresponds to a scattered plane wave incident from the right ( aharonov & bohm 1959 ) . from  ( [ eq : onshellmatrix ] ) , we get the expectation value @xmath95 shelankov ( 1998 ) has obtained an approximate formula for the transverse component of the force acting on a stationary beam of finite angular width .",
    "his analysis is carried out in a singular gauge , in which the vector potential vanishes everywhere except along the @xmath96-axis . a stationary beam incident from the right ( in fact",
    ", shelankov takes the beam incident from the left , but we revert to the convention of aharonov and bohm ) is taken to be of the form @xmath97 . treating @xmath98 as small",
    "compared to @xmath99 amounts to a paraxial approximation , in which the wave evolves freely in @xmath100 ( with @xmath100 playing the role of time ) for @xmath101 , and is scattered by the vector potential at @xmath102 .",
    "the change @xmath103 in the transverse kinematic momentum , @xmath104 , is then calculated to be @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the incident wave at @xmath107 , expressed here in terms of its transverse fourier amplitudes @xmath108 .",
    "multiplying @xmath103 by the incident flux , which is given paraxially by @xmath109 , gives _",
    "shelankov s formula _ for the transverse force , @xmath110",
    "we now show that the @xmath96-component of the exact force expectation value , ie the imaginary part of ( [ eq : stationary ] ) , coincides with shelankov s formula ( [ eq : shelforce ] ) in the paraxial regime .",
    "( shelankov ( 2000 ) gives the same argument . )",
    "as discussed by berry ( 1999 ) , the state ( [ eq : super ] ) can alternatively be viewed as a superposition of scattered waves incident from the directions @xmath111 , with amplitudes @xmath112 related to the coefficients @xmath113 according to @xmath114 the paraxial approximation is valid for @xmath112 strongly peaked around @xmath115 , with angular width @xmath116 . in this case , berry ( 1999 ) has shown that @xmath117 . from ( [ eq : psiin ] ) and ( [ eq : b_m ] ) , it then follows that @xmath118 for @xmath119 , so that @xmath120 .",
    "for nonstationary wavepackets @xmath34 , whose wavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian , the expectation value of the force does not itself have much physical significance .",
    "it depends on the behaviour of the wavefunction near the flux line , regardless of where the wavepacket is localized , and can oscillate rapidly as the wavepacket evolves . of greater physical interest",
    "is the impulse imparted to the particle over the course of its evolution , either in the past or future .",

    "the phase factor @xmath153 in ( [ eq : psi ] ) insures that @xmath154 is the kinetic , rather than the canonical , momentum of the wavepacket ; its branch is chosen so that the phase factor is continuous over the region where @xmath34 is appreciable .    from ( [ eq : ifinal ] ) and ( [ eq : psi ] ) , the expectation value of the impulse is given by @xmath155 since @xmath156 has unit width , the integrand in  ( [ eq : iexpect2a ] ) is appreciable only for @xmath157 and @xmath158 . in this region , we can , to leading order in @xmath159 , replace the phase factors @xmath160 and @xmath161 by @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively , where @xmath164 is the polar angle of @xmath146 .",

    "there are two parameter regimes where the expression  ( [ eq : k2 ] ) has a simple asymptotic form , namely @xmath173 , which corresponds to slow wavepackets , and @xmath174 , which corresponds to fast wavepackets .",
    "these cases are discussed separately below .",
    "the condition @xmath173 implies that the wavepacket spreads ( with velocity @xmath175 ) more quickly than it moves ( with velocity @xmath176 ) .",
    "since @xmath156 has unit width , the integrand in ( [ eq : k2 ] ) is appreciable only for @xmath177 of order one . in this case",
    ", for @xmath173 , the phase factor @xmath178 is nearly equal to one . on the other hand , the phase factor @xmath179 oscillates rapidly in this region , and",

    "the impulse  ( [ eq : slow ] ) is independent of the width and momentum of the wavepacket , and is of order @xmath191 ( ie , inversely proportional to the distance from the flux line ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the dispersion of the momentum , which is of order @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , to detect the impulse on slow wavepackets experimentally , one would have to perform a large number of measurements ( on the order of @xmath193 ) of the asymptotic momentum on an ensemble of identically prepared systems .    by treating the motion of the centre of a slow wavepacket as a classical trajectory",
    ", we can derive an expression for the scattering cross - section @xmath194 using the classical formula , @xmath195 here @xmath196 is the impact parameter , and @xmath197 is the angular direction of the outgoing trajectory . consider a slow wavepacket ( [ eq : psi ] ) centred on the @xmath96-axis at @xmath198 at @xmath199 ( thus , @xmath200 and @xmath201 ) , moving in the @xmath202 direction with kinetic momentum @xmath154 .",

    ", the preceding should not be regarded as a legitimate derivation of the scattering cross - section .",
    "apart from certain _ ad hoc _ elements ( eg , circularly symmetric wavepacket and the determination of the impact parameter ) , a proper derivation of the cross - section from time - dependent solutions of the schrdinger equation requires wavepackets ( unlike the slow ones used here ) whose momentum is sharp .",
