    "<S> after mentioning some of the difficulties arising in lattice gauge theory from chiral symmetry , i discuss one of the recent attempts to resolve these issues using fermionic surface states in an extra space - time dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this picture can be understood in terms of end states on a simple ladder molecule .    </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry and lattice gauge theory provide two of the best known approaches to understanding non - perturbative phenomena in relativistic quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , rather interesting clashes appear when these methods are considered together . </S>",
    "<S> our understanding of this problem has seen considerable progress in the last few years , although numerous unanswered questions remain . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this talk is to introduce some of these issues from a general point of view , avoiding technical details . for a more extensive reviews , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the issues involved are rather old , going back to the species doubling phenomena observed with the first papers on lattice gauge theory . to solve this doubling , </S>",
    "<S> the regulator was modified , but this modification directly breaks chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is not a nemesis , but a virtue of the formalism . without such modifications </S>",
    "<S> , there would be no room for the well known chiral anomalies to appear . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , i believe that the conflict between chiral symmetry and the lattice is telling us something deep about the structure of relativistic quantum field theory .    </S>",
    "<S> i begin with a brief reminder of what lattice gauge theory is all about . basically , it is nothing but a mathematical trick . by removing the infinities of the underlying field theory , </S>",
    "<S> the lattice gives us a well defined mathematical system independent of perturbative expansion . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the world lines of a particle are replaced by discrete hops on a four dimensional lattice , as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ worldline ] .        </S>",
    "<S> the lattice spacing @xmath0 is an artificial construct and we must always keep in mind the need to take @xmath1 for physical results . while in place , however , the lattice provides an ultraviolet cutoff at momentum @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to making the theory finite , the lattice enables monte carlo simulations , which currently dominate the field .    </S>",
    "<S> since the lattice is a first principles approach to field theory , one could ask why care about the details of chiral symmetry . just put the problem on the computer , predict particle properties , and they should come out correctly if the underlying dynamics is relevant . while this may perhaps be a logical point of view , it ignores a vast lore built up over the years . in the context the strong interactions , the pion and the rho mesons are made of the same quarks , the only difference being whether the spins are anti - parallel or parallel . yet the pion , at 140 mev , weighs substantially less than the 770 mev rho . </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry is at the core of the conventional explanation . </S>",
    "<S> since the up and down quarks are fairly light , we have an approximately conserved axial vector current , and the pion is believed to be the remnant goldstone boson of a spontaneous breaking of this chiral symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> another motivation for studying chiral issues arises when considering the weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> here we are immediately faced with the experimental observation of parity violation , neutrinos are left handed . in the standard electroweak model </S>",
    "<S> fundamental gauge fields are coupled directly to chiral currents . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding symmetries are gauged , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ they become local , and are crucial to the basic structure of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> since the lattice is the one truly non - perturbative regulator for defining a field theory , if one can not find a lattice regularization for the standard model , the standard model itself may not be well defined .    </S>",
    "<S> a third reason to explore chiral symmetries comes from unified field theories . </S>",
    "<S> these usually have a large natural scale . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> quark and lepton masses are much smaller . in such models chiral </S>",
    "<S> symmetry can protect fermion masses from large renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> this is also one of the prime reasons for the popularity of super - symmetry , which extends this protection to scalar particles , such as the higgs meson .    </S>",
    "<S> the word `` chiral , '' based on the greek word for hand , was introduced into modern scientific jargon by lord kelvin @xcite in 1904 when in a rewriting of his baltimore lectures he said `` i call any geometrical figure , or group of points , chiral , and say it has chirality , if its image in a plane mirror , ideally realized , can not be brought to coincide with itself . ''    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of chirality is most frequently used by chemists . </S>",
    "<S> molecules whose structure is different from their mirror image are called chiral . for the particle theorist , </S>",
    "<S> however , the use of this term is associated with subtleties of the lorentz group and massless particles . </S>",
    "<S> when a particle is massless it travels at the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> this is a limiting velocity for any observer , who can not go faster than such a particle to reverse its direction . </S>",
    "<S> a direct consequence for particles with spin is that their helicity , i.e. angular momentum along their direction of motion , is frame invariant . for spin 1/2 fermions , the left and right handed components , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 and @xmath4 become independent fields . </S>",
    "<S> this independence is naively preserved under gauge interactions ; a relativistic electron tends to preserve its helicity as it travels through electromagnetic fields .    </S>",
    "<S> this concept , however , is clouded by the so - called `` chiral anomalies '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the famous triangle diagram , sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : triangle ] , coupling two vector and one axial vector current is divergent , and no regularization can keep them both conserved . if either is coupled to a gauge field , such as electromagnetism , this diagram must be regulated with that particular current being conserved . </S>",
    "<S> then the other can not be . </S>",
    "<S> these anomalies are at the core of the lattice problems .        in one spatial dimension chirality </S>",
    "<S> reduces to separating perticles into left and right movers . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly is easily understood via simple band theory @xcite . a particle of non - zero mass @xmath5 and momentum @xmath6 has energy @xmath7 . here </S>",
    "<S> i use a dirac sea description where the negative energy states are filled in the normal vacuum . considering the positive and negative energy states together </S>",
    "<S> , the spectrum has a gap equal to twice the particle mass . in the vacuum </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level is at zero energy , exactly in the center of this gap . in conventional band theory language </S>",
    "<S> , the vacuum is an insulator .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for massless particles where @xmath8 , the gap vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes a conductor , as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : conductor ] . of course </S>",
    "<S> , conductors can carry currents , and here the current is proportional to the number of right moving particles minus the number of left movers . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider gauge fields , they can induce currents , a process under which the number of right or left movers can not be separately invariant . </S>",
    "<S> this is the anomaly , without which transformers would not work .        </S>",
    "<S> this induction of currents is not a conversion of particles directly from left into right movers , but rather a sliding of levels in and out of the infinite dirac sea . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization of this discussion to three spatial dimensions uses landau levels in a magnetic field ; the lowest landau level behaves exactly as the above one dimensional case @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one particularly intriguing consequence for the standard model is that baryon number is an anomalous charge . indeed , t  </S>",
    "<S> hooft@xcite pointed out a specific baryon - number - changing mechanism through topologically non - trivial gauge configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the rate is highly suppressed due to a small tunneling factor and is far too small to observe experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the process is there in principle , and any valid non - perturbative formulation of the standard model must accommodate it . if we have a fully finite and exactly gauge invariant lattice theory , the dynamics must contain terms which violate baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> this point was emphasized some time ago by eichten and preskill @xcite and further by banks @xcite .    without baryon violating terms , something must fail . in naive approaches to lattice fermions the problem materializes via extra particles , the so - called doublers , which cancel the anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> for the strong interactions alone , a vector - like theory , wilson @xcite showed how to remove the doublers by adding a chirally non - symmetric term . </S>",
    "<S> this term formally vanishes in the continuum limit , but serves to give the doublers masses of order the inverse lattice spacing . as chiral symmetry is explicitly broken , the chiral limit of vanishing pion mass is only obtained with a fine tuning of the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> this is no longer `` protected '' ; the bare and physical quark masses no longer vanish together . </S>",
    "<S> this approach works well for the strong interactions , but explicitly breaks a chirally coupled gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> this entails an infinite number of gauge variant counter - terms to restore gauged chiral symmetries in the continuum limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is these features that drive us to search for a more elegant formulation .    to proceed i frame the discussion in terms of extra space - time dimensions </S>",
    "<S> the idea of adding unobserved dimensions is an old one in theoretical physics , going back to kaluza and klein @xcite , and often is quite useful in unifying different interactions . </S>",
    "<S> of course the extension of space - time to higher dimensions is crucial to modern string theories . </S>",
    "<S> there are probably further unexploited analogies here , but chiral symmetry in particular can become quite natural when formulated on higher dimensional membranes . here </S>",
    "<S> i use only the simplest extension , involving one extra dimension .        </S>",
    "<S> i start with an observation of callan and harvey @xcite , building on jackiw and rebbi @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they argue that a five dimensional massive fermion theory formulated with an interface where the fermion mass changes sign , as sketched in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : massstep ] , can give rise to a four dimensional theory of massless fermionic modes bound to the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy states on the interface are naturally chiral , and anomalous currents are elegantly described in terms of a flow into the fifth dimension .    while the callan and harvey discussion is set in the continuum , kaplan @xcite suggested carrying the formalism directly over to the lattice . in the wilson formulation </S>",
    "<S> , the particle mass is controlled via the hopping parameter , usually denoted @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the massless situation is obtained at a critical hopping , @xmath10 , the numerical value of which depends on the gauge coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to set up an interface as used by callan and harvey , one should consider a five dimensional theory with a hopping parameter which depends on the extra fifth coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence should be constructed to generate a four dimensional interface separating a region with @xmath11 from one with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> shamir @xcite observed a substantial simplification on the @xmath12 side by putting @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> then that region decouples , and the picture reduces to a four dimensional surface of a five dimensional crystal . the physical picture is sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kaplan ] . for a hamiltonian discussion , </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> . indeed , surface modes are not a particularly new concept ; in 1939 shockley @xcite discussed their appearance in band models when the inter - band coupling becomes strong . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has stimulated several closely related variations that have attracted considerable recent attention @xcite @xcite @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> i will now discuss these `` domain - wall fermions '' from a rather unconventional direction . </S>",
    "<S> following a recent paper of mine @xcite , i present the subject from a `` chemists '' point of view , in terms of a chain molecule with special electronic states carrying energies fixed by symmetries . for lattice gauge theory , placing one of these molecules at each space - time site </S>",
    "<S> gives excitations of naturally zero mass . </S>",
    "<S> this is in direct analogy to the role of chiral symmetry in conventional continuum descriptions . after presenting this picture </S>",
    "<S> , i will wander into some comments and speculations about exact lattice chiral symmetries and schemes for gauging them .        to start , consider two rows of atoms connected by horizontal and diagonal bonds , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ novert ] . </S>",
    "<S> the bonds represent hopping terms , wherein an electron moves from one site to another via a creation - annihilation operator pair in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> later i will include vertical bonds , but for now consider just the horizontal and diagonal connections .    </S>",
    "<S> years ago during a course on quantum mechanics , i heard feynman present an amusing description of an electron s behavior when inserted into a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> if you place it initially on a single atom , the wave function will gradually spread through the lattice , much like water poured in a cell of a metal ice cube tray . with damping </S>",
    "<S> , it settles into the ground state which has equal amplitude on each atom . to this day </S>",
    "<S> i can not fill an ice cube tray without thinking of this analogy and pouring all the incoming water into a single cell .    </S>",
    "<S> i now complicate this picture with a magnetic field applied orthogonal to the plane of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces phases as the electron hops , causing interesting interference effects . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , consider a field of one - half flux unit per plaquette . </S>",
    "<S> this means that when a particle hops around a unit area ( in terms of the basic lattice spacing ) the wave function picks up a minus sign . </S>",
    "<S> just where the phases appear is a gauge dependent convention ; only the total phase around a closed loop is physical . </S>",
    "<S> one choice for these phases is indicated by the numbers on the bonds in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ novert ] .     can not reach @xmath14 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the phase factors cause cancellations and slow diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider the two shortest paths between the sites * a * and * b * in fig .  [ cancel ] . with the chosen flux , these paths exactly cancel . for the full molecule this cancellation extends to all paths between these sites . </S>",
    "<S> an electron placed on site * a * can never diffuse to site * b*. unlike in the ice tray analogy , the wave function will not spread to any site beyond the five nearest neighbors .        as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian has localized eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> while it is perhaps a bit of a misuse of the term , these states are `` soliton - like '' in that they just sit there and do not change their shape . </S>",
    "<S> there are two such states per plaquette ; one possible representation for these two states is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ novertone ] . </S>",
    "<S> the states are restricted to the four sights labeled by their relative wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> their energies are fixed by the size of the hopping parameter @xmath9 .        for a finite chain of length @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath16 atoms , and thus there should be a total of @xmath16 possible states for our electron ( ignoring spin ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath17 plaquettes , and thus @xmath18 of the above soliton states . </S>",
    "<S> this is almost the entire spectrum of the hamiltonian , but two states are left over . </S>",
    "<S> these are zero energy states bound to the ends of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function for one of those is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ noverttwo ] . </S>",
    "<S> we now have the full spectrum of the hamiltonian : @xmath17 degenerate states of positive energy , a similar number of degenerate negative energy states , and two states of zero energy bound on the ends .    </S>",
    "<S> now consider what happens when vertical bonds are included in our molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the phase cancellations are no longer complete and the solitonic states spread to form two bands , one with positive and one with negative energy . however , </S>",
    "<S> for our purposes , the remarkable result is that the zero modes bound on the ends of the chain are robust . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding wave functions are no longer exactly located on the last atomic pair , but now have an exponentially suppressed penetration into the chain . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ icetray3 ] shows the wave function for one of these states when the vertical bond has the same strength as the others . </S>",
    "<S> there is a corresponding state on the other end of the molecule .        </S>",
    "<S> when the chain is very long , both of the end states are forced to zero energy by symmetry considerations . </S>",
    "<S> first , since nothing distinguishes one end of the chain from the other , they must have equal energy , @xmath19 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a change in phase conventions , effectively a gauge change , can change the sign of all the vertical and diagonal bonds . following this with a left right flip of the molecule will change the signs of the horizontal bonds . </S>",
    "<S> this takes the hamiltonian to its negative , and shows that the states must have opposite energies , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicative of a particle - hole symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these results forces the end states to zero energy , with no fine tuning of parameters .    for a finite chain </S>",
    "<S> , the exponentially decreasing penetration of the end states into the molecule induces a small interaction between them . </S>",
    "<S> they mix slightly to acquire exponentially small energies @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> as the strength of the vertical bonds increases , so does the penetration of the end states . at a critical strength , </S>",
    "<S> the mixing becomes sufficient that the zero modes blend into the positive and negative energy bands . in the full model , </S>",
    "<S> the mixing depends on the physical momentum , and this disappearance of the zero modes is the mechanism that removes the `` doublers '' when spatial momentum components are near @xmath22 in lattice units @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> energy levels forced to zero by symmetry lie at the core of the domain wall fermion idea . on every spatial site of a three dimensional lattice </S>",
    "<S> we place one of these chain molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the distance along the chain is usually referred to as a fictitious `` fifth '' dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the different spatial sites are coupled , allowing particles in the zero modes to move around . </S>",
    "<S> these are the physical fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetries that protect the zero modes now protect the masses of these particles . </S>",
    "<S> their masses receive no additive renormalization , exactly the consequence of chiral symmetry in the continuum . the physical picture is cartooned in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ kaplantwo ] , where i have rotated the fifth dimension to the vertical . </S>",
    "<S> our world lines traverse the four dimensional surface of this five dimensional manifold .        </S>",
    "<S> this scheme is for the fermions of the theory , and nothing extra is needed for the gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we do not want the gauge fields to see the extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> thus we keep @xmath23 independent of @xmath24 and have no fifth component , i.e. @xmath25 . in some sense calling our </S>",
    "<S> extra coordinate a dimension is a bit of a convention ; @xmath24 might as well be regarded as a `` flavor '' @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the domain wall approach gives rise to a natural chiral theory on one wall . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a particularly elegant formulation of the strong interactions , minimizing the doubling required by existing no - go theorems . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> the left and right handed quarks reside on opposite walls .    for a chiral theory </S>",
    "<S> , however , the existence of anti - walls raises unresolved questions . for a finite fifth dimension </S>",
    "<S> the walls always appear in pairs . because the gauge fields do not know about the fifth dimension </S>",
    "<S> , the same gauge fields appear on each wall . </S>",
    "<S> the opposite chirality fermion zero modes found there represent `` mirror '' fermions ; a theory with a left handed neutrino on one wall will naturally have a right handed partner on the other . </S>",
    "<S> how to resolve this issue for the standard model is still controversial .    </S>",
    "<S> one speculative approach was presented a few years ago @xcite , where an unusual identification of the particles on the two walls was enabled via the introduction of a four fermion coupling deep in the interior of the extra dimension , as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ transfer ] . </S>",
    "<S> the introduced four - fermion operator is `` technically irrelevant , '' and fully gauge invariant . </S>",
    "<S> it is baryon number violating , but , as noted earlier , this is a necessary feature of any fully finite formulation of the standard model .        </S>",
    "<S> this particular approach has not received much attention because of difficulties in treating the four fermion coupling . in particular , there is a serious danger that such a coupling could induce a spontaneous breaking of one of the gauge symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this would be a disaster for the picture since such breaking would naturally be at the scale of the cutoff .    </S>",
    "<S> i hope this description of domain - wall fermions in terms of simple chain molecules has at least been thought provoking . </S>",
    "<S> i now ramble on with some general remarks about the basic scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the end states relies on using open boundary conditions in the fifth direction . </S>",
    "<S> if we were to curl our extra dimension into a circle , they will be lost . to retrieve them , consider cutting such a circle , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ circleone ] . of course </S>",
    "<S> , if the size of the extra dimension is finite , the modes mix slightly . </S>",
    "<S> this is crucial for the scheme to accommodate anomalies @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> suppose i want a theory with two flavors of light fermion , such as the up and down quarks . for this one might cut the circle twice , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ circletwo ] . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this construction keeps one chiral symmetry exact , even if the size of the fifth dimension is finite . since the cutting divides the molecule into two completely disconnected pieces , in the notation of the figure we have the number of @xmath26 particles absolutely conserved . similarly with @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> subtracting , we discover an exactly conserved axial charge corresponding to the continuum current @xmath28 the conservation holds even with finite @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a small flavor breaking since the @xmath30 mixes with the @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> these symmetries are reminiscent of kogut - susskind @xcite , or staggered , fermions , where a single exact chiral symmetry is accompanied by a small flavor breaking . </S>",
    "<S> now , however , the extra dimension gives additional control over the latter .        despite this analogy , the situation is physically somewhat different in the zero applied mass limit . </S>",
    "<S> staggered fermions are expected to give rise to a single zero mass goldstone pion , with the other pions acquiring mass through the flavor breaking terms . in my double cut domain - wall picture , however , the zero mass limit has three degenerate equal mass particles as the lowest states . to see how this works it is simplest to discuss the physics in a chiral lagrangian language . </S>",
    "<S> the finite fifth dimension generates an effective mass term , but it is not in a flavor singlet direction . </S>",
    "<S> it is in a flavor direction orthogonal to the naive applied mass . in the usual mexican hat picture , the two mass terms compete and the true vacuum rotates around from the conventional `` sigma '' direction to the `` pi '' direction .    </S>",
    "<S> now i become more speculative . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of using multiple cuts in the fifth dimension to obtain several species suggests extensions to zero modes on more complicated manifolds . by having a variety of zero modes </S>",
    "<S> , we have a mechanism to generate multiple flavors . </S>",
    "<S> maybe all the physical fermions in four dimensions arise from a single fermion field in the underlying higher dimensional theory . </S>",
    "<S> schematically we might have something like shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ starbw ] . where each point represents some four dimensional surface and the question remark represents structures in the higher dimension that need specification .     symmetry , and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 could represent a lepton from the same family . ]    </S>",
    "<S> [ starbw ]    one nice feature provided by such a scheme is a possible mechanism for the transfer of various quantum numbers involved in anomalous processes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the baryon non - conserving t hooft process@xcite might arise from a lepton flavor tunneling into the higher manifold and reappearing on another surface as a baryon . </S>",
    "<S> this generic mechanism is in fact the basis of the specific proposed formulation of the standard model on the lattice@xcite mentioned earlier .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> i have argued that because it is totally finite , the lattice forces honesty in understanding any peculiar phenomena that arises , and this can reveal deep features of quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry issues represent a dramatic example of this .    </S>",
    "<S> i presented a simple molecular picture for zero modes protected by symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates the mechanism for mass protection in the domain - wall formulation of lattice fermions . </S>",
    "<S> finally i speculated on schemes for generating multiple fermion species from the geometry of higher dimensional models . </S>",
    "<S> the latter may have connections with the activities in string theory . </S>"
