    "the theoretical approaches for the nuclear pion dynamics @xcite followed so far can be put into different categories .",
    "all works acknowledge and consider the important role of short - range correlation effects .",
    "however , there is no common consensus about their absolute strength .",
    "the latter depends decisively on the subtle details of the considered approach .",
    "for instance the non - relativistic computations @xcite obtain contrasted results for the pion properties in cold nuclear matter . with few exceptions @xcite",
    "non - relativistic many - body techniques are applied .",
    "also works that incorporate the feedback effect of a dressed pion propagator , that depends sensitively on the isobar propagator itself , on the isobar self energy are in the minority @xcite .",
    "it has been found that self - consistency is a crucial effect for the nuclear @xmath2 dynamics .",
    "moreover , the in - medium isobar propagator should be used in the computation of the isobar - hole contribution building up the short range correlation effects @xcite . in the early works that addressed self consistency issues @xcite a quite soft phenomenological form factor",
    "this implies a strong and artificial suppression of pionic soft modes with large momentum that dominate the isobar width @xcite .",
    "the use of such soft form factors explains why in @xcite quite conventional isobar properties @xcite were obtained without the inclusion of vertex correction effects in the isobar self energy .",
    "the use of soft form factors suppresses the in - medium mass and width shifts of the isobar significantly .",
    "noteworthy is the work @xcite , in which isobar properties were computed without relying on soft form factors .",
    "the important role of a hard factors in the nuclear @xmath2 dynamics was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "one may conclude that a description of isobar properties @xcite that relies on soft form factors should not be considered microscopic unless one includes a strong density , energy and momentum dependence in the form factor .",
    "a further possibly important aspect is the splitting of the isobar modes in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "an isobar moving through nuclear matter manifests itself in terms of longitudinal and transverse modes described by distinct spectral functions .",
    "the splitting of the two modes was found to be small in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in @xcite sizeable effects were found depending , however , on the precise structure of the form factors used .",
    "notwithstanding , further clarification on the form of the isobar self energy in nuclear matter is needed .",
    "this is of particular relevance for instance in applications to heavy - ion reactions @xcite .",
    "recently it was demonstrated @xcite that a covariant form of the isobar - hole model differs significantly from non - relativistic versions thereof @xcite .",
    "relativistic corrections are not important everywhere in phase space . as a striking example recall the behavior of the nucleon - hole contribution to the pion self energy .",
    "a proper relativistic treatment leads to a result proportional to @xmath3 , with the pion energy and momentum @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a non - relativistic evaluation provides a factor @xmath6 only @xcite .",
    "obviously , the non - relativistic expression is justified only in a small subspace of phase space . paying contribute to this observation various prescriptions",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) were suggested in the literature .",
    "one may speculate that the incompatible treatment of such effects is an important source for conflicting sets of migdal parameters used in the literature @xcite .    though it should be possible to incorporate relativistic effects in a perturbative manner with possible partial summations required",
    ", we argue that it is more economical to perform computations that are strictly covariant . applying the projector techniques developed recently @xcite it is straight forward to perform such calculations . in @xcite a first manifest covariant and self consistent computation of the pion self energy",
    "was presented .",
    "the incorporation of scalar and vector mean fields for the nucleon was worked out recently in @xcite at hand of the nuclear antikaon dynamics .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend the previous studies of two of us @xcite .",
    "we compute the isobar self energy in a covariant and self consistent manner generalizing the covariant isobar - hole model of @xcite .",
    "vertex correction effects as well as the longitudinal and transverse isobar modes are treated consistently .",
    "results will be presented for a range of parameters centered around a parameter set that was found to be compatible in @xcite with the nuclear photoabsorption data @xcite .",
    "the effect of various approximation is discussed and illustrated comprehensively .",
    "we specify the isobar - hole model in its covariant form @xcite .",
    "the interaction of pions with nucleons and isobars is modelled by the leading order vertices @xmath7 where we use @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 in this work .",
    "short range correlation effects are modelled using the covariant forms of the migdal interaction vertices as introduced in @xcite @xmath11 where it is understood that the local vertices are to be used at the hartree level",
    ". the fock contribution can be cast into the form of a hartree contribution by a simple fierz transformation .",
    "therefore it only renormalizes the coupling strength in ( [ cov - migdal ] ) and can be omitted here . the lagrangian densities ( [ pin - pid ] , [ cov - migdal ] ) are effective in the sense that we consider their coupling constants as functions of the nuclear density .",
    "this is justified since we do not incorporate the physics of higher lying baryon resonances nor further mesonic degrees of freedom like the vector mesons explicitly . integrating out more massive degrees freedom leads to a density dependence of the coupling constants necessarily , which however , is expected to be quite smooth due to high - mass nature of the modes treated implicitly .",
    "unfortunately , there is yet no set of migdal parameters universally accepted .",
    "for instance , the computation @xcite used the universal values @xmath12 , based on a study of isobar properties .",
    "universal values for the migdal parameters were suggested first in @xcite .",
    "nakano et al .",
    "@xcite deduce the constraint @xmath13 together with @xmath14 insisting on the empirical quenching factor @xmath15 of the gamow - teller resonance @xcite .",
    "their consideration assumes that the quenching results exclusively from a mixing of the nucleon - hole and the isobar - hole state . in our work",
    "the parameters @xmath16 are varied around the values @xmath17 obtained from a detailed analysis of the nuclear photo absorption data @xcite .",
    "our studies will be based on the in - medium nucleon propagator parameterized in terms of scalar and vector mean fields : @xmath18\\ , \\delta\\big[(p-\\sigma^n_v\\,u)^2-m_n^2\\big]\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad \\qquad \\times \\,\\big ( \\pslash- \\sigma_v\\,\\uslash + m_n \\big)\\,\\theta \\big[k_f^2+p^2-(u\\cdot p)^2\\,\\big]\\ , , \\label{def - sn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fermi momentum @xmath19 specifies the nucleon density @xmath20 with @xmath21 in the rest frame of the bulk with @xmath22 one recovers with ( [ rho - u ] ) the standard result @xmath23 .",

    "-0.1 cm -0.3 cm    in nuclear matter the isobar self energy tensor , @xmath26 , is a quite complicated object which involves the time - like 4-vector @xmath27 characterizing the nuclear matter frame .",
    "in order to arrive at a reproduction of the p33 pion - nucleon partial - wave amplitude we allow for a phenomenological energy dependence in the free - space isobar mass . we write @xmath28 where we introduce also a scalar mean field @xmath29 for the isobar . at nuclear saturation density",
    "we found the values @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 gev to be consistent with the nuclear photo absorption data in an application of the present covariant and self consistent many - body approach @xcite .",
    "note that latter values are scheme dependent reflecting the particular in - medium processes taken into account explicitly .    making the assumption that the p33 amplitude is determined completely by the s - channel exchange of the dressed isobar , for a given isobar self energy",
    "the mass function @xmath32 can be expressed directly in terms of the empirical p33 phase shift .",
    "based on the self energy to be specified in section 5 we arrive at the mass function shown in fig .",
    "1 with a dashed line .",
    "the sizeable variation of @xmath32 on @xmath33 reflects contributions to the p33 amplitude that are characterized by left - hand branch points .",
    "the amplitude receives , besides the s - channel isobar exchange , additional contributions like from the nucleon u - channel process .",
    "since the latter contribution will be considered being , implied by ( [ pin - pid ] ) , it is not consistent to proceed with the dashed mass function of fig .",
    "a fully consistent approach would require at least the unitarization of the sum of s - channel isobar and u - channel nucleon exchange processes .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of the present work . in order to correct for the presence of the u - channel nucleon exchange we determine the phenomenological mass function @xmath34 in the following way :",
    "the s - channel isobar contribution is adjusted to reproduce the imaginary part of the p33 partial wave amplitude in the vicinity of the isobar peak .",
    "away from the resonance the mass function is kept constant .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "1 with a solid line . as compared to the dashed line , which reproduces the p33 amplitude exactly , the solid line shows a much reduced variation .",
    "this is welcome since the smoother the phenomenological mass function the smaller are the uncertainties implied by the ansatz ( [ def - sigma - s - delta ] ) .",
    "the quality of our prescription is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , where the empirical p33 partial wave amplitude in the convention of @xcite is confronted with the phenomenological amplitude .",
    "real and imaginary parts agree well in the resonance region .",
    "significant deviations are noted close to threshold only , where we expect a strong energy dependence from the u - channel contributions .",
    "this is confirmed by the additional solid line of fig .",
    "2 which shows the contribution of the u - channel nucleon exchange process . close to threshold",
    "it is largest almost making up the difference of the empirical and phenomenological amplitude .",

    "the results depend on the details of the in - medium isobar propagator which will be specified in section 5 and 6 .",
    "following @xcite we construct the pion self energy in terms of the longitudinal nucleon- and isobar - hole loop functions .",

    "such a term is motivated by the fact that the vertices of ( [ pin - pid ] ) do not reproduce the empirical s - wave scattering pion - nucleon length . at tree - level",
    "the vertices ( [ pin - pid ] ) lead to a pion - nucleon isospin averaged scattering length of the form @xcite , @xmath51 this leads to @xmath52 fm , a significant overestimation of the empirical scattering length of about @xmath53 fm @xcite . using the unitarized isobar propagator",
    "as implied by the one - loop isobar self energy of section 5 we obtain @xmath54 fm instead , a value significantly reduced and closer to the empirical constraint . in order to correct for the remaining slight mismatch we use @xmath55 fm in ( [ full - result ] ) .",
    "there are two important technical issues we need to emphasize here .",
    "first the application of the longitudinal and transverse projectors in ( [ def - decom - pi ] ) implies that the loop functions have to satisfy specific constraint conditions .",
    "they follow from the observation that the polarization tensor @xmath43 is regular , in particular at @xmath56 and at @xmath57 .",
    "it must hold @xmath58 the reader may wonder why we discuss this point .",
    "after all the integrals ( [ nh - dh ] ) are finite and the conditions ( [ constraint - polarization ] ) should be satisfied automatically .",
    "however , we argue in favor of a finite renormalization which is not necessarily compatible with ( [ constraint - polarization ] ) . a finite renormalization of the isobar - hole loop functions is useful as to suppress the formation of ghosts in the pion self energy . the latter may be absorbed into a redefinition of the migdal s short - range interaction ( [ cov - migdal ] ) .",
    "the occurrence of ghost causes a severe problem , in particular in a self consistent approach .",
    "it implied that the pion self energy does not satisfy a lehman representation anymore .",
    "a ghost state is present if the pion self energy has a pole for complex energies , i.e. @xmath59 = 0    \\qquad { \\rm with } \\qquad \\im \\omega   \\neq 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that a function that satisfies a lehman representation can have poles only on the 2nd or higher riemann sheets .",
    "in fact , we observe that such artifacts are avoided typically once a finite renormalization is implemented such that all elements @xmath60 are bounded for large energies , i.e. @xmath61 as detailed in appendix a we introduce a finite renormalization for the isobar - hole loop functions by insisting on subtracted dispersion - integral representations thereof .",
    "the construction of the latter was determined by the constraints ( [ constraint - polarization ] ) .",
    "we checked that our numerical pion self energies satisfy a once - subtracted dispersion - integral representation to reasonable accuracy . in our self",
    "consistent simulations we impose such a dispersion - integral representation , where the subtraction constant is determined as to find agreement with the direct computation at @xmath62 .",
    "it is evident that there is a self - consistency issue here .",
    "the isobar propagator defining the isobar - hole loop functions in ( [ nh - dh ] ) is a crucial ingredient to evaluate the pion self energy . since , the isobar self energy depends sensitively on the pion propagator itself a self consistent computation is required .",
    "the importance of self consistency , as discussed above , will be addressed in the second last section when presenting numerical results .",

    "the asymptotic behavior of the isobar - hole loop as given in ( [ matrix - dh ] ) is at odds with the condition ( [ bounded - assumption ] ) .    to derive the general results for the isobar - hole loop functions it is advantageous to choose a representation slightly different to ( [ matrix - dh ] ) .",
