    "in the last few years the number of known extragalactic , non - nuclear x - ray sources emitting well above the eddington limit of a 20 @xmath0 black hole ( l@xmath1 ) has been dramatically increasing with now hundreds of candidates @xcite thanks to the wealth of data acquired by _",
    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , _ suzaku _ and _ swift_. however , the nature of these ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) is still a matter of great debate .",
    "most are probably accreting black holes , but it is still unclear if they represent a new class of intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ; @xmath2 ) or if they are stellar mass black holes ( stmbhs ; @xmath3 ) with super - eddington and/or mildly beamed emission ( see @xcite for a recent review on ulxs ) .",
    "the compact nature of ulxs was first confirmed by detection of x - ray variability on short timescales , down to minutes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for long - term x - ray variability came with the repetition of pointed observations , which showed that they are also variable on timescales of months and years ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the first long - term x - ray monitoring of a ulx was done with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on m82  x-1 @xcite .",
    "m82  x-1 displays a 62-day period over 10 cycles that is likely the orbital period of the system @xcite because the high coherence of the signal over a 3-year monitoring is consistent with a strictly periodic signal .",
    "however , other ulxs are usually fainter ( in terms of observed flux ) or more distant and could not be monitored by rxte .",
    "the arrival of the _ swift _ x - ray telescope @xcite finally opened the way to follow the brightest of these sources with coverage with sufficient cadence and effective area to set statistically meaningful limits on underlying behaviour .",
    "although based on a small sample , it revealed that ulxs were in general highly variable on timescales of days , by factors of a few to 15 @xcite .",
    "however , their variability does not usually show any clear periodic behaviour , with some exceptions .",
    "in addition , the peculiar hlx-1 , the most luminous confirmed ulx , shows strong outbursts that appear to repeat every year @xcite with the x - ray count rate varying by a factor of 40 .",
    "apart from m82  x-1 and hlx-1 , strictly periodic x - ray variability has been reported for only a handful of ulxs .",
    "for example , m  51  x-7 displays a 2.1  hour periodicity @xcite and a ulx in ngc  3379 shows a 12.6  hour periodicity @xcite .",
    "however , these periods have usually been observed in single , short observations and have not been confirmed .",
    "in addition , these few objects are usually observed with an x - ray luminosity that is only slightly above @xmath4 and are probably low - mass , or intermediate - mass x - ray binaries seen to radiate at or slightly above their eddington luminosity .",
    "their short periods favour this explanation @xcite .",
    "brighter ulxs that show evidence for periodicities are quite rare .",
    "ngc  5408  x-1 ( hereafter n5408x1 ) displayed a long , 115  day periodicity in monitoring done with _",
    "swift _ for @xmath5 ( @xcite , hereafter s09 ) .",
    "the latter object is the subject of this paper .",
    "a very luminous and unresolved x - ray source in ngc  5408 ( @xmath6  mpc , @xcite ) was discovered with the einstein observatory @xcite in the early 1980s that revealed itself later to be part of a population of extragalactic accreting black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "ngc  5408  x-1 has since been observed multiple times at different wavelengths ( see @xcite for radio studies , @xcite for optical studies , @xcite for the spectral energy distribution of the source from ultraviolet to near - infrared ) .",
    "it has been seen to display an average x - ray luminosity ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) of @xmath7 ( s09 ) with clear variability on timescales of minutes , days , months , and years within a factor of @xmath8@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the source is also one of the few ulxs where quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been discovered @xcite , although a clear result on their meaning is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the constancy of the x - ray spectral properties of n5408x1 @xcite which does not allow a study of the timing properties over a wide range of spectral parameters @xcite , hampering a clear observational result on the behaviour of the qpos with regard to that in gbhbs .",
    "intensive _ swift _ monitoring of n5408x1 has shown a @xmath10 periodicity that has been interpreted as the orbital period of the ulx system ( s09 , @xcite ) , although @xcite suggests that this modulation may instead be super - orbital .",
    "a study based on high - resolution optical spectra of this ulx @xcite also shows some inconsistency between the available constraints on the mass function and an orbital period of @xmath11 . in this paper",
    ", we examine again the long term x - ray behaviour of n5408x1 using the large number of _ swift _ observations performed since that report up until the end of june 2012 .",
    "this represents a factor of 3 increase in time coverage .",
    "we also discuss peculiarities that are visible in the light curves and suggest new observations that would lead to a better understanding of this ulx .",
    "all observations from the _ swift _ data archive for ngc  5408  x-1 , up until the end of june 2012 , have been retrieved , which amount to 354 observations that span 1532  days ( april 9 , 2008 - june 19 , 2012 , see table  [ tab_xrtdata ] for more details ) .",
    "this corresponds to the most detailed x - ray monitoring of an ultraluminous x - ray source ever , including two periods of quasi - daily observations spanning respectively 116 days ( may 1 , 2011 - august 24 , 2011 ) and 29 days ( january 29 , 2012 - february 26 , 2012 ) .",
    "this is the best sampling used to date to monitor a ulx on long periods , which compares favorably to the @xmath9@xmath12  days cadence of previous observations ( see table  [ tab_xrtdata ] ) and allows us to look for short duration phenomenons in more details ."
