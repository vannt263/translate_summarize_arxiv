    "there is strong evidence that the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in the centers of massive early - type galaxies is bottom - heavy with respect to the imf in the milky way disk .",
    "the evidence primarily comes from three distinct observations .",
    "first , recent stellar population synthesis ( sps ) modeling consistently indicates a relatively large contribution of low mass stars to the integrated light ( e.g. , cenarro et  al .",
    "2003 ; van dokkum & conroy 2010 , 2011 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012b ; smith , lucey , & carter 2012 ; spiniello et  al .",
    "2012 ; la barbera et  al . 2013 ; la barbera , ferreras , & vazdekis 2015 ) .",
    "second , the dynamics of massive galaxies are better fitted when a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf is assumed for the stellar component than when a kroupa ( 2001 ) or chabrier ( 2003 ) imf is used ( e.g. , thomas et  al . 2011 ; cappellari et  al . 2012 ; dutton , mendel , & simard 2012 ) .",
    "dutton et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) show that this also holds for very compact galaxies , which are thought to have only a minor contribution from dark matter within their effective readius .",
    "third , gravitational lensing studies show a behavior similar to the dynamical studies , requiring a salpeter - like imf for the highest mass lenses ( e.g. , treu et  al .",
    "2010 ; spiniello et  al . 2011",
    "; sonnenfeld et  al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "it is encouraging that all three methods are qualitatively consistent , and that comparisons of different techniques generally show the same trends .",
    "conroy et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) show that dynamical and stellar population synthesis modeling of compact galaxies are consistent with each other , and posacki et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) combine lensing with stellar population modeling .",
    "lyubenova et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) find good agreement between dynamical and stellar population measurements of galaxies in the califa survey , carefully controlling for systematic differences in the methodology . taking these studies a step further ,",
    "spiniello et  al . ( 2015a ) combine lensing , dynamics , and sps modeling to constrain both the slope and the cutoff of the imf below 1  for a sample of nine galaxies .",
    "however , not all studies are in agreement , and the question whether the imf varies between galaxies is not yet settled . as shown by smith ( 2014 ) a direct comparison of published results of the same individual galaxies using different techniques shows very large scatter .",
    "in addition , a detailed study of several very nearby strong lenses suggests tension between the lensing masses and the sps - inferred ones ( smith , lucey , & conroy 2015 ) .",
    "another example of possible tension is the lack of variation in the number of x - ray binaries with galaxy velocity dispersion ( peacock et  al .",
    "2014 ) , although this constrains the imf at high masses , not low masses .",
    "it is likely that these disagreements , and the large differences between some independent measurements of the same galaxies ( see smith 2014 ) , are due to a combination of factors .",
    "first , it seems that there is considerable galaxy - to - galaxy scatter in the imf ( e.g. , conroy & van dokkum 2012b ; leier et  al .",
    "furthermore , it is certainly the case that the random errors in all methods underestimate the true uncertainty ( see , e.g. , tang & worthey 2015 ) .",
    "a striking illustration of this is fig .",
    "12 of conroy & van dokkum ( 2012b ) , which shows that the sps - derived imf can vary between milky way - like and super - salpeter for different model assumptions and spectral fitting regions . also , different techniques are sensitive to different stellar mass ranges , as explored effectively in spiniello et  al .",
    "( 2015a ) .",
    "whereas lensing and dynamics measure the total mass , which includes stellar remnants , dark matter , and gas , sps methods are sensitive to the light of stars in specific mass ranges ( see fig .",
    "17 of conroy & van dokkum 2012a , and conroy et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "another possible explanation for the variation between studies is that the imf may not only vary _ between _ galaxies but also _ within _ galaxies .",
    "if this is the case , the use of different effective apertures will introduce scatter even if the same methodology is applied to the same objects .",
    "also , for a given projected aperture , lensing is sensitive to the mass in a cylinder , dynamics to the mass in a sphere , and stellar population synthesis to the projected light .",
    "imf gradients may be expected , because the velocity dispersion , surface mass density , metallicity , age , and @xmath8-enhancement all change with radius ( e.g. , mehlert et  al .",
    "2003 ; kuntschner et  al .",
    "2010 ) , and the imf may correlate with these parameters ( conroy & van dokkum 2012b ; hopkins 2013 ) .",
    "there are also reasons to expect an imf gradient from the formation history of massive galaxies .",
    "there is evidence that the centers of many massive galaxies were assembled in a short period of intense star formation at @xmath9 ( bezanson et  al .",
    "2009 ; oser et  al . 2010",
    "; barro et  al . 2013 ; nelson et  al .",
    "2014 ) that is distinct from their later growth .",
    "the physical conditions inside these star forming cores were very different from those in the milky way disk today ( e.g. , zolotov et  al .",
    "2015 ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "2015 ; barro et  al .",
    "2016 ) .    in the previous papers in this series ( van dokkum & conroy 2012 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012b ) we used an effective aperture of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the projected half - light radius .",
    "this small aperture was largely determined by the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) that is required to measure the imf - sensitive band ( wing & ford 1969 ) . for comparison , dynamical studies typically quote results at @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we extend this analysis to larger radii , using newly obtained data from the kecki telescope in combination with an updated suite of stellar population synthesis models .",
    "this is not a new topic : studies of gradients in imf - sensitive spectral features go back at least to boroson & thompson ( 1991 ) , who found that the doublet increases toward the centers of early - type galaxies .",
    "the difficulty is that stellar abundances also change with radius ; boroson & thompson ( 1991 ) could not clearly distinguish an imf gradient from a gradient in the sodium abundance ( see also worthey , ingermann , & serven 2011 ) .",
    "recent work has provided somewhat conflicting results , even with high data quality and sophisticated modeling .",
    "martn - navarro et  al .",
    "( 2015a ) find evidence for strong imf gradients ( from bottom - heavy in the center to milky way - like at large radii ) in two massive early - type galaxies , and a constant imf in a low mass galaxy .",
    "similarly , la barbera et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) derive a strong imf gradient in a single massive elliptical galaxy using deep optical and near - ir spectroscopy with the very large telescope .",
    "in contrast , mcconnell , lu , & mann ( 2016 ) suggest that the observed line index gradients of two massive early - type galaxies can be fully explained by abundance variations , and zieleniewski et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) use spatially - resolved spectroscopy to derive a milky way imf for two of the three brightest galaxies in the coma cluster . adopting a different approach , davis & mcdermid ( 2017 ) find significant variation in the imf gradients among seven galaxies using their molecular gas kinematics .    in this paper",
    ", we build on this previous work using optical spectroscopy extending to @xmath13 m obtained with the dual - beam low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) on keck .",
    "we obtained high quality spectra out to @xmath14 , thanks to a custom long slit mask and the fact that we spent half of the observing time on empty sky fields .",
    "following the methods we used in previous papers in this series , and in contrast to other studies of imf gradients , we fit state of the art models directly to the spectra rather than to indices .",
    "we obtained spatially - resolved spectroscopy of six early - type galaxies on december 1920 2014 , using lris on the kecki telescope . for three of the galaxies we obtained deep data with a special long slit , and interspersed the science images with blank sky exposures of equal integration time .",

    "the wavelength - calibrated individual amplifiers of each science exposure were placed in a common 2d image , taking the detector gap into account .",

    "this is particularly important for the broad o@xmath50(@xmath51 ) band at @xmath52 , which is independent of the oh lines and varies on short time scales . to do this , a small region at the bottom of the frame",

    "was placed on the top detector away from the chip gap ( the standard slit pointing origin ) , this region is at a radius of approximately @xmath53 from the center .",
    "we verified that the galaxy flux at this radius is sufficiently low that its subtraction has a negligible effect on the analysis in this paper .",
    "the individual science frames were combined , scaling by the collapsed galaxy flux and rejecting high and low pixels .",

    "the spectra were divided by a polynomial in the wavelength direction to reduce the dynamic range and highlight the absorption lines at all radii . with a few isolated exceptions ( such as the strong @xmath565578[oi ] line ) the spectra are very clean with no obvious systematic issues .",
    "for all six galaxies we extracted one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) reduced spectra . the apertures are defined in units of binned ( @xmath26 ) pixels . with the exception of the inner apertures they are spaced quadratically , following the relation @xmath57 , with @xmath58 an integer and @xmath59 the aperture radius in pixels .",
    "this scaling is a compromise between having a sufficiently fine sampling of the full radial range and maximizing the s / n ratio in each bin .",
    "the central aperture is 3 pixels ( @xmath60 ) , corresponding to the approximate seeing .",

    "each radius occurs twice , as spectra are independently extracted from each side of the galaxy . because the weighting and masking are not the same on each side of the galaxy , the positive and negative distances from the center are not identical .",

    "we also show the residual after subtracting the green line .",
    "there are virtually no features in these `` residuals of the residuals '' , which means that we model the _ variation _ of the spectra ( from galaxy to galaxy and as a function of radius ) extremely well .",

    "the residuals are probably not due to problems in the data , as the six galaxies have different radial velocities : if the systematic residuals were related to the sky subtraction , the telluric absorption correction , or the response function they would line up in the observed frame , not the rest - frame .",
    "it is also unlikely that they are caused by errors in the line profiles .",
    "although the assumption of gaussian profiles is a simplification ( see , e.g. , van der marel & franx 1993 ) , there is no correlation between the strength of absorption features and the amplitude of the residuals .",

    "for example , the main deficiency in the red in conroy & van dokkum ( 2012b ) was that the models underpredicted the strength of the calcium triplet lines , whereas in the present study the main residuals are at the locations of tio bandheads .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising given the many changes to the stellar population synthesis models since our previous papers .      in this paper",

    "furthermore , the decrease of nad with radius is gradual rather than abrupt , and there is no obvious kinematic difference between this line and the other absorption lines ( see schwartz & martin 2004 ) .",
    "the  doublet also varies strongly with radius , as do many other spectral features , particularly in the blue .",
    "the  feature and the calcium triplet lines do _ not _ show much variation .",

    "this result is consistent with several recent studies that used different models and were based on index measurements rather than on full spectrum fitting ( see martn - navarro et  al .",
    "2015a ; la barbera et  al .",
    "it is also consistent with earlier work on the centers of the most massive galaxies ( van dokkum & conroy 2010 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012b ) . given all the changes in our models and the vast improvements in data",
    "quality it is remarkable that we reached similar conclusions in 2010 as we do today .",
    "the reason is probably that we began by targeting the most extreme galaxies , which are least sensitive to the details of the modeling .",
    "the agreement is not universal , however .",
    "mcconnell et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) use very similar data , but conclude that the observed radial trends in two early - type galaxies can be explained entirely by abundance gradients .",
    "it may be that those two galaxies happen to have milky way imfs throughout , but that is not a very satisfying explanation .",
    "modeling of the mcconnell et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) data using similar techniques as employed here may shed more light on this .",
    "abundance gradients are certainly a concern in all these studies , as they can mimic imf effects .",
    "it is well known that the  doublet is sensitive to the na abundance , and as discussed by conroy & van dokkum ( 2012a ) and la barbera et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) the  band depends on [ fe / h ] and , in certain regimes , on age and [ @xmath8/fe ] .",
    "the upshot is that the two strongest gravity - sensitive features in the optical window are both difficult , or even impossible , to interpret in isolation .",
    "allowing non - solar abundance ratios is critical , particularly for na .",
    "furthermore , only full spectrum fitting , or a carefully chosen combination of different indices ( see conroy & van dokkum 2012a ) , can isolate imf effects .",
    "as the modeling gets more complex it becomes more difficult to identify the key data that produce a particular result ; the high degree of sophistication in this field carries the risk that the modeling begins to resemble a black box .",
    "some of these issues are addressed in conroy et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , where we use the exquisite ngc1407 data to analyze what specific stellar mass ranges are constrained by the data . in the",
    "somewhat stand - alone  5.1 we address this issue in a different way , analyzing the ratio of two spectra with similar elemental abundances but a different imf .",
    "this `` semi - empirical '' approach follows earlier work on m31 globular clusters and massive ellipticals ( van dokkum & conroy 2011 ) . in the case of ngc1407 and ngc2695",
    "we can point to specific features that drive the outcome , and the analysis also provides understanding of what spectral features constrain the imf in the rest of the sample .",
    "it is fortuitous that we have two such spectra in our small sample ; future studies could specifically single out such matched pairs for deep follow - up spectroscopy to increase the sample .    in  [ imf_int.sec ]",
    "we show that the luminosity weighted imf within an aperture depends strongly on the aperture size .",
    "lensing and dynamical studies typically have an effective aperture of @xmath160 , and we demonstrate in fig .  [ imf_int.fig ]",
    "that the gradients we measure are entirely consistent with the slacs and atlas@xmath7 constraints for galaxies with similar velocity dispersions .",
    "these results are consistent with the recent study of lyubenova et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) , who found that there is good agreement between dynamical and stellar population measurements of @xmath8 when measured in a self - consistent way and in the same aperture .",
    "we emphasize here that our entire analysis applies to massive galaxies only , with @xmath161 . as even the central imf is milky way - like for less massive galaxies ( conroy & van dokkum 2012b ) , they probably have much weaker gradients than the galaxies studied here ( see martn - navarro et  al . ( 2015a ) and spiniello et al .",
    "( 2015b ) for studies of imf gradients in two such galaxies ) .",
    "the fact that the galaxy - integrated imf ( to @xmath162 ) has @xmath163 for our massive galaxy sample may mean that the galaxy - wide imf is not very different from that of the milky way for nearly all galaxies in the universe .",
    "possible exceptions are the most compact massive galaxies ( martn - navarro et  al . 2015b ; conroy et  al . 2013 ) , and ultra - faint dwarf galaxies which may have a bottom - light imf ( geha et  al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the strong gradients that we find have implications for various areas of astrophysics , and we touch on a few here .",
    "first , the large gradient in the @xmath85 ratio ( see panel @xmath96 of fig .  [ starpops.fig ] ) needs to be taken into account when measuring the masses of supermassive black holes . as a case in point , thomas et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) use stellar kinematics to infer the existence of a black hole in ngc1600 with a mass of @xmath164 , among the most massive black holes ever found .",
    "the sphere of influence of this black hole , defined as the radius within which the black hole mass equals the stellar mass , is @xmath165kpc , or @xmath166 . within this radius",
    "we find @xmath167 for ngc1600 , which means that the dynamics are fully consistent with the imf that we derive and no `` ultra - massive '' black hole may be required .",
    "more detailed modeling of the central kinematics , using the stellar @xmath85 constraints derived here , is required to understand the full effect on derived black hole masses .",
    "another implication is that the stars that are in the centers of massive galaxies today formed in a very different way than the stars that are at large radii .",
    "as discussed in  1 there is fairly good evidence that the central @xmath168kpc are indeed unique environments , in that they assembled in a short period of intense star formation at high redshift .",
    "the outer regions were likely accreted at later times , and could therefore have abundance ratios and imfs that more closely resemble low mass satellite galaxies than the galaxy centers . turning this around",
    ", the presence of imf gradients could be viewed as evidence for the kind of two - phase formation models that were proposed by oser et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) and others . in the context of these models , and studies such as fang et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) , van dokkum et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and martn - navarro et  al .",
    "( 2015b ) , one might expect that the imf correlates better with the physical radius than with @xmath136 .",
    "both parameters correlate equally well in our small sample ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "our results do strongly suggest that the imf in compact , massive galaxies at @xmath9  which are thought to be the progenitors of the cores of today s massive galaxies  should be heavier than that of the milky way .",
    "although galaxies obviously evolve over this timeframe , both mixing due to mergers ( sonnenfeld , nipoti , & treu 2016 ) and projection effects are expected to decrease , not increase , the observed central value of @xmath8 over time .",
    "there may be some tension with observations : the dynamics of both star forming and quiescent massive compact galaxies seem to point to relatively low @xmath85 ratios ( belli , newman , & ellis 2013 ; van de sande et  al .",
    "2013 ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "the uncertainties are currently too large to place strong constraints , but this should change with improved measurements of high redshift galaxies in the jwst era . it may turn out that the high redshift galaxies have gradients too , and/or that we are misinterpreting their galaxy - integrated kinematics ( as may be indicated by recent observations ; newman et al .  2015 ; belli et al .",
    "it will also be important to have better calibrated stellar @xmath85 ratios at young ages ( see dutton et  al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "finally , our results have implications for star formation theory .",
    "probably the most important result in this context is the finding that the imf can be even heavier than the salpeter ( 1955 ) form , something that had been suggested in recent studies ( e.g. , chabrier , hennebelle , & charlot 2014 ) .",
    "these implications are discussed in paper iv in this series ( conroy et al .",
