    "the metallic spinel liv@xmath0o@xmath1 has been identified as the first 3@xmath5 system with heavy quasiparticles.@xcite the low temperature specific heat coefficient @xmath60.4 j mol@xmath7k@xmath8 is considerably enhanced as compared with that of simple metals and the same holds true for the spin susceptibility @xmath9 . for high temperatures , @xmath1050 k ,",
    "the latter shows a curie - weiss behavior , @xmath11 , where the curie constant @xmath12 = 0.47 @xmath13k/(mol v ) and the weiss temperature @xmath14 k@xmath15 implies an antiferromagnetic interaction between the v ions .",
    "no magnetic ordering has been observed down to 0.02 k.@xcite concerning the entropy @xmath16 whose temperature dependence is determined from the specific heat , one finds that @xmath17 k@xmath1810 j/(mol@xmath19k ) which is close to 2@xmath202 where @xmath21 denotes the gas constant .",
    "thus at 60 k there is nearly one excitation per v ion .",
    "this suggests strongly that the low - lying excitations which lead to the heavy quasiparticle behavior result from spin degrees of freedom .",
    "needless to say that the original discovery of the heavy quasiparticles in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 has initiated many experimental studies to follow including transport , nmr , @xcite @xmath22sr,@xcite pes,@xcite and inelastic neutron scattering work.@xcite a special feature of the spinels and hence of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is that the v ions occupy the sites of a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the latter consists of corner sharing tetrahedra . for a microscopic understanding of the observed heavy quasiparticle behavior with an average number @xmath23 of @xmath5-electrons per v ion , two different approaches starting from either a strong or a weak coupling limit are possible .",
    "they have been reviewed in ref.and we want to discuss them briefly now .",
    "density functional calculations based on the lda demonstrate that electrons near the fermi energy e@xmath24 are of @xmath25 character.@xcite the calculated density of states within lda is too small by a factor of 25 in order to explain the large @xmath26 coefficient .",
    "therefore in ref .",
    "[ ] the limit of strong correlations was taken as a starting point . in that limit",
    ", charge fluctuations between v ions are strongly suppressed due to both the on - site and nearest neighbor inter - site electron coulomb repulsions.@xcite thus , in the ground state slowly varying charge configurations include v sites that are either singly ( spin-1/2 ) or doubly ( spin-1 ) occupied . in the latter case",
    "s = 1 is due to the hund s rule .",
    "the ground state consists of configurations in which the spin-1/2 and spin-1 sites form two subsets of chains ( rings ) and the spin chains are effectively decoupled because of geometrical frustration in the pyrochlore lattice . within this spin chain model , the nearest neighbor ( @xmath27 ) exchange couplings",
    "@xmath28 are assumed only .",
    "the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , of the spin-1/2 chains is found to be large . only a factor of two is missing as compared with experiment . here",
    "@xmath313 mev is the @xmath27 spin-1/2 chain coupling , as obtained from lda+u calculations .",
    "the spin-1 chains with a gapped spectrum do not contribute to @xmath26 coefficient .",
    "our recent analysis has shown , however , that in the model formulation the next - neares ( @xmath32 ) coupling @xmath33 can not be excluded , which may lead to a considerable renormalization of the above estimate of @xmath26 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath34 , the spin-1/2 chain system may even enter the regime of dimerization .",
    "of course , effects of the kinetic energy which were omitted so far should also be included in an extended spin chain model .    because of these growing complications , it is of interest to investigate what results for the spin correlations are , when one starts from the limit of weak correlations instead . in this limit ,",
    "the @xmath5-electrons are in broad lda energy bands in contrast to nearly localized electronic states in the opposite limit . since the effects of electron coulomb repulsions are neglected ( except for those already contained in the lda )",
    ", the geometrically frustrated lattice structure plays a role only as it affects the form of the lda energy bands .",
    "as shown below , this results however in a characteristic form of the @xmath3-dependence of the unenhanced dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath35 .",
    "so the starting points of both approaches are very different .",
    "the hope is that both limits can eventually brought to convergence in a region which is between the two limiting situations .",
    "the present work was first motivated by results of quasielastic neutron scattering measurements@xcite carried out on polycrystalline samples of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . at low temperatures",
    "strong quasielastic neutron scattering was found in a range of wavevectors , 0.4@xmath36 .",
    "the quasielastic linewidth @xmath37 is of a few mev , indicating a slow spin dynamics in the above @xmath38 region .",
    "because of the relation between the measured dynamic structure factor and the imaginary part of the dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath39 , calculation of @xmath40 is of fundamental importance to interpret inelastic neutron scattering data .",
    "our aim is to include a realistic electronic band structure for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 into rpa - like calculations of the dynamic spin susceptibility .",
    "the latter is enhanced due to exchange - correlation effects of electrons on the vanadium 3@xmath5-orbitals .",
    "the calculations are performed for @xmath41=0 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the study of @xmath2 along high - symmetry directions in the reciprocal space and focus on the analysis of its low frequency behavior .",
    "as shown below , even such a restricted consideration allows us to gain insight into the low - temperature spin dynamics of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and provides a basis for a comparison of computational results with experimental data .",
    "our main findings are the following ( i ) the dominant maxima of the calculated unenhanced spin susceptibility @xmath35 , i.e. , the one from lda occur in the same region of @xmath3-space where the largest intensity of the inelastic neutron scattering is found ; ( ii ) a moderate value of the electronic local exchange - correlation coupling @xmath42 is sufficient within rpa to bring the system close to a magnetic instability and thus to a strong slowing down of spin fluctuations for wave vectors @xmath3 determined by ( i ) .    because we assume local , hubbard - like electron interactions , the exchange - correlation coupling @xmath42 is @xmath3-independent and therefore treated here as an orbital - independent adjustable parameter . along the way , we will discuss possible extensions of the theory in some detail , but not pursue them further .",
    "the random - phase approximation was applied to the one - band hubbard model by izuyama , kim , and kubo in their seminal work@xcite and developed further by doniach.@xcite the multiband generalization of the rpa to the dynamic spin susceptibility adopted here is in a close relation with earlier works by cook@xcite and callaway and co - workers.@xcite we mention also papers by stenzel and winter @xcite along that line .",
    "the connection with these works will be pointed out at various places in the discussion below .",
    "we address also the problem of spin fluctuation contribution @xmath43 to the low temperature specific heat coefficient @xmath26 . as known,@xcite slow spin - fluctuation dynamics can be described approximately by a system of overdamped oscillators . in general",
    ", these oscillators are characterized by @xmath3-dependent spin relaxation rates @xmath44 . based on the available inelastic neutron scattering data @xcite and our rpa calculation of @xmath2 in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , we suggest below a model describing a particular distribution of @xmath44 in @xmath3-space . then we show that a diversity of experimentally determined values of @xmath45 leads to a theoretical estimate for @xmath43 that falls also into a broad range with the largest value being close to @xmath26 observed in experiment .",
    "a similar rpa approach to a fluctuation mechanism in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 based on a tight binding model for the v-3d bands has been proposed in ref .  [ ] in an attempt to explain the specific heat enhancement .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed for the supersymmetric case where all spin / orbital fluctuations are controlled by the same nearly critical interaction parameter . in the numerical calculations",
    "the instability is obtained only around the center of the brillouin zone and the large mass enhancement is due to contributions from all possible spin / orbital fluctuations at @xmath3=0 . in our approach",
    "we take the complementary view point that ( i ) only the spin fluctuations are close to be critical and ( ii ) the critical spin fluctuations at @xmath46 are located in a wide region of @xmath3-space far away from the brillouin zone center in accord with the experimental evidence from inelastic neutron scattering . thus in our model the extended region of nearly critical spin fluctuations in momentum space is a promising candidate for the large mass enhancement .",
    "to define a reciprocal lattice for the cubic spinel structure of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , it is convenient first to introduce the orthogonal basis vectors @xmath47 , ( @xmath48 ) , of the length @xmath49 ; here @xmath50=8.23  is the lattice parameter.@xcite the irreducible brillouin zone ( bz ) of the underlying fcc lattice is a polyhedron depicted in fig .",

    "is calculated within the lda in the framework of lmto ( linear muffin tin orbitals ) and using the atomic sphere approximation .",

    "the octahedral component of the crystal field is strong enough to split the vanadium 3@xmath5 bands into two separate and non - overlapping bands originating from @xmath25 and @xmath61 orbitals .",
    "a weak trigonal component of the crystal field produces a further splitting of the low - lying set of @xmath25 orbitals into ( @xmath62 ) orbitals .",
    "the latter dominate the electronic states near the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "the complexity of the band structure results in many sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "recalling that liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is found to be a paramagnet down to very low temperatures , we assume that the system remains spin disordered at all temperatures , and carry out a calculation of the dynamic spin susceptibility for @xmath46 . without external magnetic field",
    "the longitudinal and the transverse susceptibility are the same .    in the multi - band model under consideration , the time- and space - fourier transform of the dynamic spin susceptibility for the lda band electrons takes the familiar form @xmath63 @xmath64 in ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , the plane - wave matrix elements are calculated on the basis of bloch functions @xmath65 with the band index @xmath66 and energy @xmath67 .",

    "@xmath70 matrix elements of @xmath71 are involved , which lead to the well known problem of large matrix inversion .",
    "since the magnetically active 3@xmath5-orbitals of vanadium ions are rather compact , a large set of the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath54 has to be taken into account and thus a matrix @xmath71 of high dimension has to be inverted .",
    "one encounters a similar problem when calculating the inverse dielectric matrix for electrons in transition metals.@xcite to overcome this difficulty , an elegant procedure based on a simple and reliable approximation has been proposed and developed by several authors.@xcite we are now in a position to discuss some preliminaries of this procedure , the central point of which is the search for a separable form for the plane - wave matrix elements entering eq .",

    "there are altogether twelve bands of dominant @xmath5-character which originate from partially occupied @xmath62 orbitals of the vanadium ions .",
    "therefore , one expects that the bloch functions @xmath72 for the actual @xmath5-bands near the fermi energy can be well described by the orbital basis set @xmath73 of bloch functions defined in terms of atomic - like @xmath62-orbitals localized on the pyrochlore lattice sites @xmath74 : @xmath75 here the sum is over @xmath76 @xmath77-sites of the underlying fcc lattice .",
