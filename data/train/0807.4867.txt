    "one of the most successful attempt to resolve the problems of standard big bang cosmology such as homogeneity , isotropy , and flatness of the universe is the inflationary paradigm , characterised by an epoch of accelerated expansion , `` inflation '' , in the very early universe . during the inflationary epoch , quantum fluctuations",
    "are highly amplified , their wavelengths are stretched to outside the hubble horizon and inevitably , superhorizon fluctuations are generated .",
    "these fluctuations become classical after crossing the event horizon and are coherent on what appear to be superhorizon scales at decoupling . after the end of inflation , they re - enter the horizon , and seed the matter and the radiation fluctuations observed in the universe . these primordial fluctuations",
    "are gaussian , adiabatic and nearly scale - invariant in the majority of inflation models and even a slight deviation from these properties can strongly constrain the assumptions in cosmological models . since the linearity of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy preserves the basic properties of these primordial fluctuations , the cmb radiation anisotropy is a promising tool for testing these properties .",
    "however , it is known that the observed quadrupole ( @xmath0 , which is the largest scale that can be observed ) amplitude has a lower value than the quadrupole expected from a best - fit @xmath1-dominated cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) standard model to the entire power spectrum since the first data of the differential microwave radiometer ( cobe / dmr ) appeared in 1992 .",
    "this anomaly was confirmed with the high resolution data provided by the first year ( 2003 ) and 3-year ( 2006 ) wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap , wmap3 ) .",
    "most recently , the 5-year wmap data did not improve on the quadrupole , it still seems to be outside of the fit .",
    "today , this low value of the quadrupole seems inescapable and the main issue now is to elucidate possible explanations .",
    "the proposed four possible candidates are that this anomaly is due to a systematic error , a pure statistical fluke , astrophysical ( i.e. unexpected foreground ) or cosmological reasons ( e.g. nontrivial spatial geometry of the universe ) .",
    "although the correct explanation is still unknown , the first three candidates seem unlikely .",
    "if it is indeed due to cosmological reasons , since the lowest multipoles represent especially the scale of the horizon at approximately dark energy ( de ) domination , it seems natural to associate the low value of the quadrupole with the nature of the de .",
    "it is known that bianchi universe anisotropies give rise to cmb anisotropies depending on the model type .",
    "recently , campanelli et al . showed that allowing large - scale spatial geometry of the universe to be plane - symmetric with eccentricity ( regardless of the origin ) at decoupling of order @xmath2 can bring the quadrupole amplitude in accordance with observations without affecting higher multipoles of the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy .",
    "although they are controversial , it should be mentioned here that there are also some independent indications of a symmetry axis in the large - scale geometry of the universe , coming from the analysis of spiral galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and from the analysis of polarization of electromagnetic radiation propagating over cosmological distances .",
    "a spatially ellipsoidal geometry of the universe can be described with bianchi type metrics .",
    "however , bianchi type i , v , vii models isotropize at late times even for ordinary matter , and the possible anisotropy of the bianchi metrics necessarily die away during the inflationary era .",
    "in fact this isotropization of the bianchi metrics is due to the implicit assumption that the de is isotropic in nature . if the implicit assumption that the pressure of the de is direction independent is relaxed , the isotropization of the bianchi metrics can be fine tuned to generate arbitrary ellipsoidality ( eccentricity ) .",
    "therefore , the cmb anisotropy can also be fine tuned , since the bianchi universe anisotropies determine the cmb anisotropies .",
    "the price of this property of de is a violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) since the de crosses the phantom divide line ( pdl ) , in particular depending on the direction .",
    "however , it has been known since the 1980s that such energy components might occur and their role as possible de candidates was raised by caldwell at the end 1990s ( see for further references ) . in theory , despite the observational constraints , extensions of general relativity are the prime candidate class of theories consistent with pdl crossing . on the other hand , while the current cosmological data from snia ( supernova legacy survey , gold sample of hubble space telescope ) , cmb ( wmap , boomerang ) and large scale structure ( sdss ) data rule out the @xmath3 , they mildly favor dynamically evolving de crossing the pdl ( see , for theoretical and observational status of crossing the pdl ) .",
    "recently , rodrigues and koivisto & mota have investigated cosmological models with anisotropic equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "rodrigues has constructed a bianchi type - i @xmath1cdm cosmological model with a de component which is non - dynamical but wields anisotropic vacuum pressure in two ways : i ) by implementing of anisotropic vacuum pressure consistent with energy - momentum tensor conservation ; ii ) by implementing a poisson structure deformation between canonical momenta such that rescaling of the scale factor is not violated .",
    "he suggests to fine tune the de so as to not wipe out the anisotropic imprints in the inflationary epoch . on the other hand ,",
    "koivisto & mota have proposed a different approach to resolve cmb anisotropy problem ; even if the cmb formed isotropically at early time , it could be distorted by the direction dependent acceleration of the later universe in such a way that it appears to us anomalous at the largest scales .",
    "they have investigated a cosmological model containing a de component which has a non - dynamical anisotropic eos and interacts with the perfect fluid component .",
    "they have also suggested that cosmological models with anisotropic eos can explain the quadrupole problem and can be tested by snia data .    in reference mota",
    "et al . have concluded that even though a perfect fluid representation might ultimately turn out to be a phenomenologically sufficient description of all the observational consequences of de , imperfectness in de can not be excluded .",
    "although there is compelling evidence that the expansion of universe is speeding up , we are far from understanding of the nature of the de which is thought be the reason for this behaviour .",
    "hence , we should examine models with anisotropic dark energy , in order to determine what possible new physical consequences they might give rise to , and if for no other reason than to rule such models out .",
    "the above discussions lead us to examine the physical behaviours of the two - fluid , particularly @xmath1cdm , cosmological models with an anisotropic de component .",
    "models of de are conveniently characterized by the eos parameter @xmath4 which is not necessarily constant , where @xmath5 is the energy density and @xmath6 is the pressure . however , while energy density is a scalar quantity , pressure is a vectorial quantity , and consequently the eos parameter of de may be determined separately on each spatial axis in a consistent way with the conservation of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "hence , we consider a phenomenological parametrization of minimally interacting de in terms of its time - dependent deviation - free equation of state parameter @xmath7 and deviation parameters @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "since such a parametrization yields an anisotropic expansion which is not compatible with the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric , in section 2 we have used the locally rotationally symmetric bianchi type i ( lrs bianchi - i ) metric which generalizes the flat rw metric in an axially symmetric way and is compatible with our parametrization .",
    "the other component has assumed to be a perfect fluid ( dark matter or ordinary matter ) . with our assumptions ,",
    "the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor implies dynamically anisotropic de except for very special solutions .",
    "we have obtained exact solutions for the equations by assuming a special dynamic for the anisotropy of the dark the energy and a special law of variation for the mean hubble parameter in bianchi metrics , which yields a constant value of deceleration parameter .",
    "the assumption on the mean hubble parameter allows us to determine the scale factors exactly , as well as to examine the behaviour of the anisotropy of de and other cosmological parameters of such a universe .",
    "the spatially homogenous , anisotropic and lrs bianchi - i space - time is described by the line element @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the scale factors ( metric tensors ) and functions of the cosmic time @xmath12 . in natural units ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , the field equations , in the case of a mixture of the perfect fluid and the anisotropic de components , are @xmath15 with @xmath16\\\\ \\nonumber = \\mathrm{diag}[1,-w^{\\mathrm{(m)}},-w^{\\mathrm{(m)}},-w^{\\mathrm{(m)}}]\\rho^{\\mathrm{(m)}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath17\\\\ \\nonumber = \\mathrm{diag}[1,-{w_{x}}^{\\mathrm{(de)}},-{w_{y}}^{\\mathrm{(de)}},-{w_{z}}^{\\mathrm{(de)}}]\\rho^{\\mathrm{(de)}}\\\\ \\nonumber = \\mathrm{diag}[1,-(w^{\\mathrm{(de)}}+\\delta),-(w^{\\mathrm{(de)}}+\\gamma),-(w^{\\mathrm{(de)}}+\\gamma)]\\rho^{\\mathrm{(de)}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is the four - velocity vector ; @xmath20 is the ricci tensor ; @xmath21 is the ricci scalar ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the energy densities of the perfect fluid and de components respectively ; @xmath24 is the eos parameter of the perfect fluid and we will call @xmath25 the deviation - free eos parameter of the de . here",
    ", the perfect fluid represents the ordinary matter or cold dark matter , thus @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the directional eos parameters of the de on @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 axes respectively . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are set to be equal which is convenient with the metric given in ( 1 ) . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are deviations from the deviation - free eos parameter ( hence the deviation - free pressure ) of the de respectively on @xmath30 axis and @xmath31 and @xmath32 axes . in a comoving coordinate system , einstein s field equations ( 2 ) , for the anisotropic lrs bianchi - i space - time ( 1 ) , in case of ( 3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) , read as @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 where the over dot denotes derivation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath12 .",
    "we have the following equation from the bianchi identity , @xmath38 which yields @xmath39 this equation , which is linearly dependent to einstein field equations , also represents the conservation of the total energy momentum tensor .",
    "we have initially 8 variables ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 , @xmath33,@xmath34 ) and four equations , three of which are linearly independent , namely three einstein field equations ( 5 - 7 ) and the bianchi identity .",
    "the system is thus initially undetermined and we need additional constraints to close the system .",
    "we have assumed that the de is minimally interacting , @xmath42 ; thus due to the bianchi identity ( 8) the perfect fluid component is also minimally interacting , @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the bianchi identity has been split into two separately additive conserved components ; namely , the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the de @xmath44 and the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid component @xmath45 once more we may split the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the dark - enery into two parts : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the last term of the @xmath48 in ( 10 ) and arises due to the deviations from @xmath25 , and @xmath49 is the the deviation - free part of the @xmath48 in ( 10 ) .",
    "now , we will do the following strong assumption , @xmath50 which also results in the deviation - free part of the @xmath48 to be null , that is , @xmath51 which looks like the conservation of the energy momentum tensor of a minimally interacting perfect fluid . according to ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) the behaviour of @xmath23 is controlled by the deviation - free part of the eos parameter of the de ( @xmath25 ) , but the deviations will affect @xmath23 indirectly , since , as can be seen later , they affect the value of @xmath25 . if the deviation parameters are assumed to be constants , to assure @xmath52 either @xmath33 and @xmath34 are trivially null or the ratio of the expansion rate on @xmath30 axis to the expansion rate on @xmath31 axis is equal to @xmath53 which is a very special case . on the other hand",
    ", we may get more general solutions , if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are allowed to be function of the cosmic time @xmath12 and we constrained @xmath33 and @xmath34 by assuming a special dynamic which is consistent with ( 13 ) .",
    "the dynamic of the deviation parameter on the @xmath30 axis , @xmath54 , is assumed to be @xmath55 and thus from ( 13 ) the deviation parameter on the @xmath31 and @xmath32 axes , @xmath56 , is found as @xmath57 in such an assumption @xmath54 and @xmath56 are dimensionless parameters , and @xmath58 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the amplitude of the deviation from @xmath25 and can be given real values .",
    "the measure of the anisotropy of the de may be given by @xmath59 and it is null , which implies the de is isotropic , when @xmath60 .",
    "the eos parameter of the perfect fluid has been assumed to be constant , @xmath61 while @xmath25 is allowed to be a function of the cosmic time , since the current cosmological data from snia , cmb and large scale structures mildly favor dynamically evolving de crossing the pdl as mentioned in the section 1 .",
    "hence , since @xmath62 hasnt been constrained , we still need one more constraint to close the system .",
    "we imposed a law of variation for the hubble parameter .",
    "the law of variation for the hubble parameter which was initially proposed by berman for rw space - time and yields a constant value of deceleration parameter .",
    "such a law of variation for hubble parameter given by berman is not inconsistent with observations and is also approximately valid for slowly time varying deceleration parameter @xcite . recently",
    "singh and kumar proposed a similar law of variation for the hubble parameter in anisotropic space - time metrics that yields a constant value of the deceleration parameter , and generated solutions for bianchi type - i , lrs bianchi type - ii , bianchi type - v @xcite metrics in general relativity . according to the proposed law",

    "the anisotropy of the de , @xmath153 , is null for @xmath60 , changes slightly and converges to a non - zero constant for @xmath225 ; see fig [ fig : adem ] .      from ( 24 )",
    "we can see that the initial time of the universe is @xmath227 for @xmath156 . for brevity of the equations",
    ", we may redefine the cosmic time as @xmath228 and by doing that the initial time of the universe has also been set as @xmath160 .",
    "thus we may rewrite the metric as @xmath229 using ( 32 ) we may get the ratios of the scale factors @xmath97 for @xmath156 , and manipulating the result by using ( 24 ) we get the following exact expressions for the scale fators ; @xmath230 @xmath231 where @xmath100 is the positive constant of integration .",

    "but we may mention that this model may only be valid for intermediate epochs of the universe . because @xmath104 diverges at @xmath182 and @xmath183 in this model",
    ", thus @xmath23 will eventually get negative values as @xmath200 goes to extrem values , since the anisotropy of the expansion contribute the energy density of the de negatively .",
    "locally rotationally symmetric bianchi - i cosmological models with dynamically anisotropic dark energy ( de ) and perfect fluid have been constructed in general relativity .",
    "we assume that the dark energy ( de ) is minimally interacting , has dynamical energy density and anisotropic equation of state parameter ( eos ) .",
    "the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the de has been assumed to consist of two separately additive conserved parts .",
    "a special law has been assumed for the deviation from isotropic eos , which is consistent with the assumption on the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the de .",
    "exact solutions of einstein s field equations have been obtained by assuming a special law of variation for the mean hubble parameter , which yields a constant value of the deceleration parameter and is not inconsistent with observations .",
    "some basic geometrical and kinematical features of the models and the dynamics of the anisotropic de in these models have been examined .",
    "a more general eos parameter has been introduced for the de , and the isotropic de can be recovered by choosing @xmath58 to be null , where @xmath58 parametrizes the amplitude of the deviation from isotropic eos parameter of the de .",
    "in all the models , while the anisotropy of the de contributes to the expansion of one of the scale factors , it opposes to the expansion of the other .",
    "two parameters that parametrize the difference between directional hubble parameters , @xmath94 and @xmath58 , give rise to non - trivial , dynamically anisotropic , expansion histories .",
    "this allows for the possibility to fine tune the isotropization of the bianchi metric during an accelerating epoch of the universe in order to generate arbitrary ellipsoidality by choosing a suitable value of @xmath58 .",
    "such a result provides also the possibility to fine tune the cmb anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy of the expansion can mildly or totally isotropize in relatively earlier times of the universe .",
    "nevertheless , it converges to a nonzero constant value for the later times of the universe in all models .",
    "it is also observed that the anisotropy of the de energy does nt always act so as to increase the anisotropy of the expansion , when signs of @xmath94 and @xmath58 are opposite the overall effect is to lower the expansion anisotropy in relatively earlier times of the universe .",
    "one interesting observation is that the higher the anisotropy of the expansion the lower the energy density of the de in each given instant of the cosmic time .",
    "@xmath25 is also dynamical and exhibits non - trivial behaviour in our model , but it eventually converges to a constant in the quintessence region for @xmath242 and converges to @xmath144 for @xmath78 .",
    "such cosmological models are of interest because they give rise to an ellipsoidality of the universe in spite of the inflation , which is one of the promising proposals to the solution of the quadrupole problem and can also be checked by the direction dependency of the redshift - luminosity relation of the snia observations .",
