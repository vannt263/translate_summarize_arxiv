    "magnetite has received a lot of attention both for fundamental and technological reasons . above the verwey transition it is a half - metal and has the highest known @xmath4 of 860 k. the crystal structure is the inverse spinel structure with the formal chemical composition fe@xmath5[fe@xmath6fe@xmath7@xmath8o@xmath9 .",
    "the two octahedrally coordinated @xmath10 positions are symmetry equivalent and order antiferromagnetically with the tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath11 site in the cubic @xmath12 spacegroup . when cooled to the verwey transition temperature , which lies around 122 - 125  k depending on sample , the conductivity of magnetite drops abruptly by two orders of magnitude .",
    "originally the structure below the verwey transition transition was thought to be have iron cations at the @xmath10 sites order as fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath13 along the ( 001 ) planes .",
    "this turned out to be too simple a model and single crystal diffraction studies showed that the low temperature structure is monoclinic with a @xmath14 supercell and a @xmath15 space group symmetry .",
    "a recent nmr study resolved 8 tetrahedral and 16 octahedral environments thereby confirming the @xmath15 space group.@xcite however , the diffracted supercell peaks are extremely weak and even a recent synchrotron diffraction study could only resolve three supercell peaks.@xcite the structure has therefore only been refined in a @xmath16 monoclinic subcell with an additional orthorhombic @xmath17 pseudo symmetry constraint ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description of the structure ) .",
    "it is generally agreed that the charge order model with alternating fe@xmath6/fe@xmath13 layers below the verwey transition is too simple but the full charge order is still not fully understood .",
    "a mssbauer study fitted the spectrum with five components.@xcite one corresponding to fe@xmath5 and four to fe@xmath18 and fe@xmath19 on two non - equivalent octahedral sites.@xcite a resonant x - ray diffraction study reported that if a charge disproportionation takes place it should be below the sensitivity limit of 25% of the experiment.@xcite recently it was noticed that the structural distortions lead to significantly different mean fe@xmath20o distances for the octahedrally coordinated iron sites.@xcite when these distances are used to calculate bond valence sums a charge modulation along [ 001 ] is found and the octahedral iron sites split into two groups with a charge disproportion of about 0.2 electron . furthermore a [ 00@xmath21 second charge modulation is found , which leads to the doubling of the @xmath3-axis compared to the cubic structure.@xcite    theoretically the problem of charge order in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 has been difficult to attack .",
    "first of all the true structure is unknown and even the simplified @xmath16 subcell is highly complex for a theoretical calculation .",
    "furthermore , the local density approximation ( lda ) is not generally applicable to highly correlated transition metal oxides , due to the spurious self interaction .",
    "if the calculations are done in the originally proposed verwey model without structural distortions , an lda calculation converges to a metallic state with the octahedral iron sites in an fe@xmath22 oxidation state.@xcite in the lda+@xmath2 method an orbital dependent field is introduced which can be shown to give a correction for the self interaction.@xcite consequently two studies have shown that the lda+@xmath2 method leads to a charge ordering.@xcite however , both these studies used the original verwey model of the structure thereby omitting both the structural distortions and the additional [ 00@xmath21 charge modulation.@xcite till date only one calculation has been done on the @xmath16 structure.@xcite both a pure lda and three self interaction corrected ( sic)-lda calculations were performed and the authors reached two surprising conclusions.@xcite first of all it was found that the scenario where five @xmath23-electrons move in the sic - lda potential on both the @xmath11 and all @xmath10 sites ( which can be interpreted as all the octahedral iron sites being in the fe@xmath13 oxidation state ) was the most stable.@xcite secondly the lowest energy state shows only a small charge disproportion of 0.1 electron .",
    "this is of similar magnitude to the charge disproportion found using pure lda , leading to the conclusion that the charge disproportion is structural of origin.@xcite one possible objection to these results could be that the minimal basis set and atomic sphere approximation used for the potential@xcite could make the total energies unreliable . a second objection could be that in the sic - lda method one must choose a set of localized states for which the sic is applied",
    ". the actual ground state will thus only be found if it is among those tested .",
    "we have therefore performed lda+@xmath2 calculations using the linearized augmented plane wave(lapw ) method .",
    "furthermore we have tested a method for deriving @xmath2-values using the lapw method .",
    "we do indeed find an electronic configuration that was not considered in the sic - lda study@xcite , but which is in good agreement with the charge disproportion that was proposed based on the experimental bond distances.@xcite the paper is arranged into two sections .",
    "first we describe the lda-@xmath2 method and how we derive @xmath2-values within the lapw method .",
    "secondly the calculated electronic structure is described .",
    "the lda+@xmath2 method essentially consists of identifying a set of atomic like orbitals which are treated in a non - lda manner.@xcite based on the lessons from hubbard model studies these orbitals are treated with an orbital dependent potential with an associated on - site coulomb and exchange interactions , @xmath2 and @xmath24.to avoid double counting in the non - spherical part of potential we use @xmath25 instead of @xmath2@xcite and omit the multipolar terms proportional to @xmath24 in the added lda+@xmath2 potential .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 is the orbital occupation matrix .",
    "this form is both rotationally invariant and is well suited for full potential calculations .    in lda",
    "the electron - electron interactions have already been taken into account in a mean field way .",
    "one must therefore identify the parts that occur twice and apply a double counting correction ( dcc ) .",
    "several different versions of the dcc exist.@xcite in the present work we will use what has been called the fully localized limit ( fll).@xcite the fll - dcc has a clear interpretation and has also been shown to give results in better agreement with experiment than other dcc.@xcite .",
    "the fll - dcc is constructed so that the atomic like limit to the total energy is satisfied , which leads to the following expression@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the orbital dependent potentials entering the kohn - sham equation that arise from the @xmath30 correction to the total energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eorb1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : efll ] ) is then @xmath31 which shows that the fll version of the orbital potential will stabilize an orbital that is more than half occupied and destabilize an orbital that is less than half occupied .",
    "the meaning of the @xmath2 parameter was discussed by anisimov and gunnarsson,@xcite who defined it as the cost in coulomb energy by placing two electrons on the same site . in an atom",
    "the @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath32 of the unscreened slater integrals.@xcite @xmath32 should thus both increase with increased ionicity and as the @xmath23-wave function is contracted across the 3@xmath23 transition series .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : slaterint ] where we show the calculated atomic slater integrals for chemically relevant 3@xmath23 ions .    due to screening",
    "the effective @xmath2 in solids is much smaller than @xmath32 for atoms . to calculate the effective @xmath2 anisimov and",
    "gunnarsson,@xcite constructed a supercell and set the hopping integrals connecting the @xmath33 orbital of one atom with all other orbitals to zero .",
    "the number of electrons in this non - hybridizing @xmath23-shell was varied and @xmath34 was then calculated from @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the spin - up @xmath33 eigenvalue . using the method of anisimov and gunnarsson ,",
    "@xmath2-values have been calculated for the di- and trivalent configurations of the 3@xmath23 elements in la perovskites.@xcite as expected the trends were the same as observed for atoms , fig .",

    ", a constant shift between the m@xmath6 ions , ranging from approximately 6.5  ev ( titanium ) to 8.5  ev ( copper ) , and the m@xmath13 ions , ranging from 8  ev to 10  ev.@xcite    the original lda+@xmath2 method@xcite was based on the linearized muffin tin orbitals basis set , where the individual orbital and hopping terms can be identified .",
    "this is not possible within the lapw method , so the method of anisimov and gunnarsson@xcite can not be directly applied . instead",
    "the hybridization can be removed putting the @xmath23-states into the core or by performing a two - window calculation . to check this procedure",
    "we have performed calculations on the well characterized nio.@xcite two calculations were performed on @xmath37 supercells each with one impurity site with the @xmath23-configuration forced to be as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath23-character of the apws at the impurity sites was eliminated by placing the @xmath23-linearization energy at a very high value .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) we hereby got a value of @xmath34=5.96  ev . the question is how this value should be used in an lda+@xmath2 calculation ? when using the spherically averaged form of @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eorb1 ] ) , @xmath24 simply rescales the orbital term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : efll ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : vfll ] ) .",
    "furthermore eq .  ( [ eq : vfll ] ) shows that an occupied and an unoccupied orbital will be split by @xmath39 .",
    "following the interpretation of anisimov and gunnarsson@xcite , this suggest that @xmath40 .",
    "as the screening of @xmath41 and @xmath42 in solids appears to be small , @xmath24 can to a good approximation be calculated from the atomic values.@xcite using a @xmath43  ev , fig .",
    "[ fig : slaterint ] , we arrive at @xmath44  ev in good agreement with earlier values.@xcite furthermore an effective onsite term of @xmath34=5.96  ev , leading to a corresponding splitting of occupied and unoccupied bands , is in excellent agreement with experiment@xcite    we then applied the method to feo and fe@xmath45o@xmath0 and obtained @xmath46  ev and 7.33 ev for fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath13 respectively .",
    "finally calculations were performed on magnetite using the @xmath37 supercell of the cubic high temperature structure .",
    "we tried placing both fe@xmath47 ( corresponding to one calculation with 3.5 spin up and 3 spin down electrons at the impurity site and one calculation with 3.5 spin up and 2 spin down ) and fe@xmath5 at the tetrahedrally coordinated a site .",
    "thereby values of @xmath484.79  ev and 6.33  ev were obtained . for the octahedrally coordinated b site values of @xmath34(fe@xmath18)=5.03  ev , @xmath34(fe@xmath49)=6.21  ev and @xmath34(fe@xmath19)=7.38  ev were calculated , showing good internal consistency with the feo and fe@xmath45o@xmath0 values .",
    "using the @xmath24 parameters derived from the atomic values , fig .",
    "[ fig : slaterint ] , we then obtain @xmath2(fe@xmath5)=7.69  ev , @xmath2(fe@xmath18)=6.2  ev and @xmath2(fe@xmath19)=8.73  ev for magnetite .",
    "our calculated @xmath34 seem somewhat larger than the @xmath2 and @xmath24 values that were earlier calculated for magnetite.@xcite however it is not clear what oxidation state was used to calculate these values@xcite and furthermore it should be noted that the values for the octahedrally coordinated @xmath10 site are in very good agreement with what was obtained for the octahedrally coordinated fe ions in the perovskites.@xcite",
    "with the @xmath2 values thus fixed we performed calculations on the low - symmetry structure@xcite using the l / apw+lo method@xcite , as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite sphere sizes of 2.0  a.u . and 1.5  a.u . were used for the fe and o sites respectively . the plane - wave ( pw ) cut - off",
    "was defined by min(@xmath50)max(@xmath51)=5.7 corresponding to approximately 3700  pw . the brillouin - zone ( bz )",
    "was sampled on a tetrahedral mesh with 100 k points ( 18 in the irreducible bz ) . on the tetrahedrally",
    "coordinated @xmath11 iron sites the calculated @xmath52  ev was used .",
    "the calculated @xmath53  ev for fe@xmath49 was used on all octahedrally coordinated @xmath10 iron sites so that no charge order was forced .",
    "when discussing charge order it is necessary to define some kind of `` atomic '' charge . in the apw method",
    "these partial charges are most commonly the integrated charge within a given sphere .",
    "they can be named @xmath54 , where @xmath55 refers to a given atomic sphere and @xmath56 to the angular quantum number .",
    "the @xmath54 values have the problem that they depend on the size of the atomic sphere , thus depend on a computational parameter .",
    "they are still useful for comparing atomic charges within the same calculation , if the sphere sizes are kept equal .",
    "they can however not directly be compared with the results of other calculations / experiments .",
    "one way to make the charges more transferable is to estimate the amount of charge leaking out of the sphere and use this for rescaling . to do the rescaling we have calculated the radial function of free fe@xmath6 and fe@xmath13 ions . by integrating the @xmath23-functions up to 2  a.u .",
    "( the sphere size used for iron in the present study ) we get an average scaling of 1.06 . in the following two valencies will be defined for the iron sites @xmath57 ( the @xmath58 and @xmath59 values are less than 0.05 electrons ) and @xmath60 .",
    "as will be shown in the next section the scaling seems to be reasonable as it brings fully localized half shells up to 5 electrons .",
    "table  [ tab : charge ] gives the fractional charges for fe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "it is seen that lda gives only a very small charge disproportionation , thus excluding that the structural distortion should be sufficient to give a charge order .",
    "in contrast the lda+@xmath2 calculation does give a charge disproportionation , table  [ tab : charge ] of approximately 0.2  electrons between the @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( high oxidation state ) and the @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( low oxidation state ) sites , thus confirming the additional [ 00@xmath21 charge modulation.@xcite table  [ tab : charge ] also reports the rescaled partial charges .",
    "it is seen that the scaling brings the charge in the majority spin @xmath23-states of the high oxidation state iron sites close to five .",
    "this is expected and lends credibility to our scaling procedure .",
    "the scaled lda+@xmath2 results in a charge disproportion of 0.2@xmath200.3 electrons and the valencies are found to be smaller than what could be expected from a naive ionic picture .",
    ".fractional charges , valencies and spin ( @xmath65 ) magnetic moments ( in @xmath66 ) calculated as explained in the computational section .",
    "the primed values have been scaled by a factor 1.06 ( see the computational section for explanation ) .",
    "the sites are labeled as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the b1 and b2 sites are both an average over two symmetry - nonequivalent sites .",
    "these sites would be symmetry equivalent in an orthorhombic unit cell and as expected ( the mono - clinic distortion is very small , @xmath67@xcite ) the values calculated for these sites are very similar and therefore only one averaged value is reported . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : fe3o4dos ] shows the calculated density of states ( dos ) for fe@xmath0o@xmath1 in the charge ordered phase . for the lda calculation the oxygen band is found between approximately -4  ev and -8  ev . above these bands one finds the bands of fe-3@xmath23 origin .",
    "furthermore a substantial hybridization between the iron sites and the oxygen @xmath68-states is seen . when the orbital field is introduced the fully occupied minority spin bands on the @xmath11-iron sites",
    "are shifted downwards below the oxygen @xmath68-shell .",
    "the same thing happens for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 iron sites .",
    "this was expected from table  [ tab : charge ] where it is seen that the @xmath61 and @xmath62 have a valency similar to the @xmath11 sites and that the majority spin bands seem to be fully occupied . figure  [ fig : fe3o4dos ] also shows that the picture is very different for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 sites .",
    "these sites are the ones with the long fe@xmath20o distances@xcite and low oxidation states , table  [ tab : charge ] .",
    "it is seen that there is a strong hybridization between the majority spin fe-3@xmath23 and the o-2@xmath68 states .",
    "furthermore there is a non - hybridizing minority spin states just below the fermi level which is not found for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 states and is the cause of the charge order . the electronic structure of the low oxidation state irons sites",
    "can thus be compared to the electronic structure of feo,@xcite where the fe-3@xmath23 states also show a strong hybridization with the o-2@xmath68 states and one sub - band in the minority spin is occupied to accommodate the additional electron .",
    "the experimental work@xcite chose to renormalize their bond valence sums so that the average valency of the @xmath10 sites was 2.5 , which is close to the average unscaled valency , table  [ tab : charge ] , in the present study .",
    "so despite the derived charges being method dependent ( see computational section ) the charges should be comparable . consequently the valencies quoted 2.39 , 2.61 , 2.59 and 2.41@xcite ( @xmath63 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath64 site respectively ) which are in extremely good agreement with the present , table  [ tab : charge ] .",
    "this we believe strongly supports our electronic structure , but then the question arrises why the earlier computational study of the charge ordered magnetite structure@xcite did not reach the same conclusion .",
    "the earlier computational work@xcite reported atomic charges and spin magnetic moments for six different @xmath10 sites in the monoclinic phase for four different types of calculations .",
    "one calculation ( labeled sic(1 ) ) is performed where the simple verwey charge order is implemented , so that the @xmath10 sites alternate between five @xmath23-electrons moving in the sic potential and six @xmath23-electrons moving in a sic potential.@xcite in our labeling a simple verwey charge order corresponds to the atoms @xmath63 and @xmath61 being in a low oxidation state .",
    "these sites are actually split into two sites each in the monoclinic symmetry ( see comment to table  [ tab : charge ] ) and consequently the sic study finds four sites ( in this paper labeled @xmath63 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath64@xcite ) that have a low oxidation state , while two sites ( @xmath62 and @xmath64 in our notation , @xmath69 and @xmath70 in their ) have a high oxidation state .",
    "this immediately explains why these authors found the charge ordered state to be higher in energy than the state where all the @xmath10 sites had five @xmath23-electrons moving in a sic potential .",
    "the simple verwey state considered earlier@xcite does not correspond to the charge ordering that could be expected from the structural distortion,@xcite which means that the @xmath62 site is calculated to be in the high oxidation state despite it having longer distances .",
    "in other words the sic calculation have omitted the second [ 00@xmath21 charge modulation found experimentally.@xcite",
    "by electronic structure calculations using the lda+@xmath2 method we have obtained a periodic charge disproportion along the @xmath3-axis in the monoclinic structure of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the proposed charge order is in good agreement with the one derived from experiment and we have explained the disagreement with an earlier sic - lda calculation ."
