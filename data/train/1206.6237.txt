    "it is well known that every closed orientable @xmath1-manifold @xmath4 can be decomposed into two handlebodies of the same genus .",
    "this is what we call a heegaard splitting of the manifold , and the genus of the handlebodies is called the genus of the splitting . given a genus-@xmath0 heegaard splitting of @xmath4 , the _ goeritz group _ of the splitting , which we will denote by @xmath5 , is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath4 that preserve each of the handlebodies of the splitting setwise . in particular , this group is interesting when the manifold is the @xmath1-sphere or a lens space since it is well known from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , that they have unique heegaard splittings for each genus up to isotopy . in this case , each goeritz group depends only on the genus of the splitting , and so we can define the _ genus-@xmath0 goeritz group _ @xmath5 of each of those manifolds without mentioning a specific heegaard splitting . for the @xmath1-sphere ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite and @xcite that @xmath6 is finitely generated , and subsequently in @xcite and @xcite that @xmath6 is finitely presented and its finite presentation was introduced .",
    "further , in @xcite , a natural generalization of a goeritz group is studied , the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the @xmath1-sphere preserving an embedded genus two handlebody which is possibly knotted .    in this work , we show that the goeritz group @xmath6 of each of the lens spaces @xmath3 is finitely presented . in the main theorem ,",
    "theorem [ thm : presentation ] , their explicit presentations are given .",
    "for the genus-@xmath2 goeritz groups of the other lens spaces and for the higher genus georitz groups of the @xmath1-sphere and lens spaces , it is conjectured that they are all finitely presented but it is still known to be an open problem .",
    "we generalize the method developed in @xcite .",
    "we find a tree on which @xmath6 for @xmath3 acts such that the quotient of the tree by the action of @xmath6 is a single edge , and then apply the well known theory of groups acting on trees due to bass and serre @xcite .",
    "such a tree will be found in the barycentric subdivision of the disk complex for one of the handlebodies of the splitting . for arbitrary lens spaces",
    "@xmath7 , finding such trees , if exist , is much more complicated problem than the case of @xmath3 , which will be fully discussed in @xcite .    throughout the paper ,",

    "finally , @xmath22 will denote a regular neighborhood of @xmath23 and @xmath24 the closure of @xmath23 for a subspace @xmath23 of a polyhedral space , where the ambient space will always be clear from the context .",
    "the fundamental group of the genus-@xmath2 handlebody is the free group @xmath25 of rank two .",
