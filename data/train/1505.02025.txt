    "the `` heavy - photon '' , or @xmath6 , is an hypothetical massive gauge boson associated to an additional @xmath0 hidden symmetry , as predicted by several `` beyond the standard model '' ( bsm ) theories @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 couples to ordinary photons through a `` kinetic mixing '' mechanism @xcite , i.e. through a loop - order effect , mediated by a gut - scale massive particle that carries both the standard - model weak hypercharge and the dark - force equivalent .",
    "this induces an effective parity - conserving interaction @xmath7 of the @xmath6 to the electromagnetic current @xmath8 , with coupling @xmath9 , where the parameter @xmath10 can naturally be in the range 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "consequently , standard model charged particles acquire a `` milli - charge '' @xmath9 for the interaction with the `` heavy - photon '' , resulting in em - like processes such as @xmath6-strahlung ( the emission of an @xmath6 by an high - energy electron ) and the @xmath6 decay to electron - positron pairs .",
    "recently , a possible role of heavy photons in dark matter physics has been suggested , generating great interest to directly search for the @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "results from indirect and direct dark matter searches have been re - interpreted as potential signals of dark matter interacting with heavy photons .",
    "for example , the positron excess in the cosmic - ray flux recently reported by ams @xcite , confirming previous results from pamela @xcite and fermi @xcite , can be explained assuming that dark matter is charged under the `` dark - force '' interaction , and decays or annihilates to @xmath6 particles , that in turn decay to @xmath13 pairs . in this picture , the @xmath6 acts as a `` mediator '' between the standard model and the dark matter sector .",
    "the non - observed excess in anti - proton fraction suggests that the @xmath6 mass is lower than @xmath14 2 gev @xcite .    in the simplest scenarios , the two main parameters that determine the characteristics of the @xmath6 and thus the experimental search strategies are : the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath10 and the mass @xmath15 .",
    "while a huge range of mixing parameters and masses are possible , it is natural that @xmath10 be around @xmath16 , and necessary that masses be around gev , if the positron excess is to be explained .",
    "other than explaining astrophysics anomalies , an @xmath6 in this mass and coupling range can explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "this parameter space region has been investigated by a large number of experiments , with so far no positive results ( see @xcite for a complete review ) .",
    "however , a significant part of it is still unknown and will be explored by planned and proposed experiments .",
    "high luminosity , fixed target experiments provide an unique way to probe this unknown region @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "an electron beam impinges on a high z target , producing heavy photons that subsequently decay to pairs of fermions .",
    "the @xmath6 is then reconstructed by measuring the decay products momenta .",
    "the kinematic of this process , sketched in figure [ fig : kin ] ( left panel ) , is characterized by a very - forward emitted @xmath6 that carries most of the incident electron beam energy @xmath17 .",
    "this results in a very small opening angle of the decay products , of the order of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 decay products will be emitted at a very low angle with respect to the beam - line , and will carry most of the beam energy . furthermore , depending on the value of the parameters , long - lived @xmath6 are possible in the aforementioned parameter space , with displaced vertexes up to hundreds of meters .",
    "the main background sources associated to this reaction are qed trident processes , i.e. bethe - heitler trident reactions and radiative trident production ( see figure [ fig : kin ] , right - panel ) .",
    "although the bethe - heitler process has a much larger total cross - section , it can be significantly reduced by exploiting its very different kinematics .",
    "instead , the radiative trident process is an irreducible background , with the same kinematic as the signal .",
    "however , it presents a smooth , continuous distribution in the @xmath13 invariant mass distribution , in contrast to the peak at @xmath19 for the signal , and occurs promptly at the production target , while the signal can be displaced for small @xmath10 values .",
    "the heavy photon search ( hps ) experiment at jefferson laboratory @xcite is a fixed - target experiment specifically designed to search for dark - photons in the mass range between 20 mev and 1 gev and coupling @xmath20 between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "hps will search for the @xmath23 decay of the heavy photon , through complementary techniques : resonance search ( the traditional `` bump - hunting '' ) and detached vertexing .",
    "in particular , hps will explore a unique region corresponding to small cross sections , out of reach from collider experiments , where thick absorbers , as used in beam - dump experiments , are not allowed due to the relatively short @xmath6 decay length ( @xmath24 1 m ) .",
    "the hps experiment will run in hall b of thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) .",
    "the high duty - cycle , high - quality electron beam , with energy tunable between 1.1 and 11 gev and current up to 250 na , will permit to reach high luminosity while keeping beam - related backgrounds under control .",
    "schematic of the hps detector setup . from left to right : the first dipole magnet , the target system , the silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) inside the analyzing dipole magnet , the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) , the third dipole magnet.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the hps detector was designed to match the foreseen signal kinematics described above .",
    "mandatory requirements are : a large and uniform acceptance in the forward region close to the beam , down to @xmath25 mrad , excellent track reconstruction efficiency for electrons and positrons , good angular and momentum resolution to reconstruct invariant mass precisely , and excellent vertex resolution to discriminate displaced @xmath6 decays from prompt qed backgrounds .",
    "radiation hardness is also a critical issue , given the high radiation environment , particularly near the target position .",
    "finally , the material budget must be as low as possible , to minimize multiple scattering and preserve the angular resolution .",
    "the hps detector is made of two main sub - components , a @xmath14 1 m long silicon tracker inside a dipole magnet ( svt ) , to measure charged particle trajectories and vertexes , and a fast lead - tungstate electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) , to measure particle energies , identify electrons and provide a fast trigger signal .",
    "the detector setup is shown in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "hps employs a three - magnet system with the second dipole serving as an analyzing magnet .",
    "the tungsten target is located in front of the analyzing magnet , at about 10 cm from the first svt layer . to reduce beam - related backgrounds , the target and the svt",
    "are mounted in a vacuum chamber .",
    "the ecal is mounted outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "the svt is made of 6 layers of si modules , each with two sensors .",
    "the introduction of a small stereo angle in between the two ( 50 or 100 mrad ) provides three - dimensional tracking and vertexing . each layer in one half",
    "is supported on a common support plate with independent cooling and readout .",
    "the svt is split in two modules , mounted on top and on bottom of the beam plane , leaving a central `` dead - region '' where the degraded beam can pass through the detector unobstructed .",
    "sensors are readout by the apv25 chip , developed for the cms experiment at the cern lhc @xcite , with a custom daq system based on the advanced telecom communications architecture ( atca ) technology .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter is also split into two halves .",
    "each half of the ecal consists of 221 pbwo@xmath5 crystals arranged in five rows .",
    "each row is made of 46 crystals , expect the one closest to the beam that has only 37 .",
    "the light from each crystal is read out by a large area avalanche photodiode ( apd ) glued on the back surface . signals from the apds",
    "are read using custom - made amplier boards before being sent to the data acquisition electronics .",
    "each signal is acquired by a 250 mhz , 12 bit flash analog to digital converter ( fadc ) , with 8 @xmath26s latency",
    ". the on - board fpga processes the digitized samples to provide information about the energy and the timing associated with each hit .",
    "the projected hps reach is reported in figure [ fig : reach ] , together with published exclusion limits from other experiments .",
    "the green band @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) corresponds to the region where the @xmath6 can explain the discrepancy between the experimental value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment , considering a 2@xmath29 ( 5@xmath29 ) error , and the corresponding standard model calculation .",
    "the red band @xmath30 , instead , corresponds to the exclusion region from the electron magnetic momentum .",
    "the reach was computed by assuming a one - week run at 1.1 gev , a one - week run at 2.2 gev , and a two - weeks run at 4.4 gev .",
    "the two regions in the reach plot correspond to the two analysis techniques employed in the experiment : the resonance search ( at larger @xmath1 ) and the detached vertex search ( at lower @xmath1 ) .",
    "they are not connected since a minimum displacement of @xmath31 mm at 2.2 gev ( @xmath14 10 mm at 6.6 gev ) is required for the vertex - based search .",
    "the preferred muon g-2 region is reported , together with published exclusion limits from other experiments .",
    "the newest results reported by the phenix collaboration are not included in this plot @xcite .",
