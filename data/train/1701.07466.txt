    "graphene has attracted increasing interest during the past few years , and is nowadays used in a great variety of applications , taking advantage of its extraordinary mechanical , electrical and thermal conductivity properties .",
    "nevertheless , its potentialities , and those of graphene - based materials , are far from being fully explored and exploited , and many studies are carried out by the scientific community in order to develop new technological applications @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the bending behavior of graphene is of paramount importance in several technological applications .",
    "it is exploited , for example , to predict the performance of graphene nano - electro - mechanical devices and ripple formation @xcite , and it is proposed to be the key point to produce efficient hydrogen - storage devices @xcite .",
    "in particular , since the bending stiffness and the gaussian stiffness that is the reluctance to form non - null gaussian curvatures are the two crucial parameters governing the rippling of graphene , it is necessary to accurately determine them for both the design and the manipulation of graphene morphology .",
    "although several evaluations of the bending stiffness have been proposed in the literature , the gaussian stiffness has not been object of an intensive study .",
    "indeed , as pointed out in a very recent review on mechanical properties of graphene @xcite , only two conflicting evaluations have been proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been used within a quantum - mechanical framework , and the value @xmath0 ev has been found . while in @xcite",
    "the estimate of @xmath1 ev has been obtained by combining the configurational energy of membranes determined by helfrich hamiltonian with energies of fullerenes and single wall carbon nanotubes calculated by density functional theory ( dft ) . at a discrete level",
    "there are two main difficulties in the evaluation of the gaussian stiffness : on the one hand , controlling a discrete double curvature surfaces is problematic , and on the other hand , a suitable notion of gaussian curvature at the discrete level should be introduced . instead , when well established continuum models are adopted , such as plate theory , one has the problem of determining the equivalent stiffnesses , letting alone the conceptual crux of giving a meaning to the notion of thickness ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we deduce a continuum 2-dimensional model of a graphene sheet inferred from molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "in particular , looking at the 2nd - generation reactive empirical bond - order ( rebo ) potential @xcite , we give a nano - scale description of the atomic interactions and then we deduce the continuum limit , avoiding the problem of postulating an `` equivalent thickness '' and circumventing artificial procedures to identify the material parameters that describe the mechanical response of a plate within the classical theory .",
    "our analysis of the atomic - scale interaction relies on the discrete mechanical model proposed in @xcite and exploited in @xcite , whose results are also based on the 2nd - generation brenner potential .",
    "this potential is largely used in md simulations for carbon allotropes ; for a detailed description of its general form and that adopted in our theory we refer the reader to appendix b of @xcite . here , we recall the key ingredients needed :    a.   the kinematic variables associated with the interatomic bonds involve first , second and third nearest neighbors of any given atom .",
    "in particular , the kinematical variables we consider are _ bond lengths _ , _ bond angles _ , and _ dihedral angles _ ; from @xcite it results that these latter are of two kinds , that we here term c and z , as carefully described in sec .",
    "[ sec : kin ] .",
    "b.   graphene suffers an angular _ self - stress _ , and the _ self - energy _ associated with the self - stress ( sometimes called _ cohesive energy _ in the literature ) is quantitatively relevant ; c.   the energetic contribution of dihedral interaction is very relevant in bending .",
    "for the first time , we propose a continuum model able to predict both the _ bending _ and the _ gaussian stiffnesses_. the analytical formula we obtain for the former predicts exactly the same value as that computed with md simulations of the last generation .",
    "the value of the gaussian stiffness we obtain is in very good agreement with dft computations proposed in @xcite .    for the modeling of graphene",
    "many different approaches at different scales can be found in the literature , ranging from first principle calculations @xcite , atomistic calculations @xcite and continuum mechanics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mixed atomistic formulations with finite elements have been reported for graphene @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kin ] , we describe the kinematics and the energetic of the graphene sheet at the nano - scale . in sec .",
    "[ sec : strains ] , we deduce the strain measures for the change of edge lengths , wedge angles and dihedral angles , approximated to the lowest order that makes the energy quadratic in the displacement . in sec .",
    "[ sec : splitting ] , the total energy is split in its in - plane and out - of - plane contributions , and focus is set on the latter , having the first already been considered in @xcite . in sec .",

    "[ plate ] the limit energy is rearranged in a more amenable form , able to put in evidence the equivalence with a plate theory . in sec .",

    "at the nano - scale a graphene sheet is a discrete set of carbon atoms that , in the absence of external forces , sit at the vertices of a periodic array of hexagonal cells .",
    "more specifically , atoms occupy the nodes of the @xmath2_lattice _ , see figure  [ fg : lattice ] , generated by two simple _ bravais _ lattices    [ ! hbtp ]        @xmath3    simply shifted with respect to one another . in",

    "graphene mechanics is ruled by the interactions between the carbon atoms given by some suitable potential . according to the 2nd - generation brenner potential @xcite , as detailed in @xcite , in order to account properly for the mechanical behavior of a bended graphene sheet it is necessary to consider three types of energetic contributions , respectively coming from : binary interactions between next nearest atoms ( _ edge bonds _ ) , three - bodies interactions between consecutive pairs of next nearest atoms ( _ wedge bonds _ ) and four - bodies interactions between three consecutive pairs of next nearest atoms ( _ dihedral bonds _ ) .",
    "there are two types of relevant dihedral bonds : the z - dihedra in which the edges connecting the four atoms form a z - shape and the c - dihedra in which the edges form a c - shape ( see fig .",
