    "in qcd with two dynamical fermions a finite temperature phase transition is expected at .",
    "the basic question of the order of this phase transition has been extensively studied in the continuum by an effective sigma model analysis@xcite and on the lattice with kogut - susskind@xcite and wilson@xcite fermions . nonetheless a conclusive answer has not yet been found .    at zero quark mass in the pisarski - wilczek scenario ,",
    "if the axial anomaly is effectively restored the transition is predicted to be a fluctuation - driven first order transtion ; in the opposite case the transition can be second order in @xmath6 universality class ; mean field critical behavior with logarithmic corrections is also possible as a limiting case between the previous two . since first order phase transitions are generally robust against small perturbations",
    ", we expect the first order behavior also if the effective coupling of the anomalous current is small enough .",
    "k - s fermions break explicity the @xmath6 simmetry to @xmath7 at finite lattice spacing , so in the case of a second order phase transition we expect @xmath7 critical behavior until the continuum limit is recovered .",
    "the mass term in the qcd lagrangian corresponds to an external magnetic field in the effective sigma model , thus we expect the transition to remain first order at finite and small quark masses if the transition were first order at @xmath8 . in the other cases , the mass term completely washes out the phase transition to an analytical crossover .    to determine which of the above possibilities is actually realized , the standard test of universality is a comparison of the critical exponents .",
    "critical exponents can be extracted from the scaling analysis of susceptibilities obtained from the second derivatives of the partition function : @xmath9\\\\ \\chi_{ij } & = & v [ \\left < p_ip_j\\right>-\\left < p_i\\right>\\left < p_j\\right > ] , \\quad i , j = \\sigma , \\tau\\\\ \\chi_{ee } & = & v [ \\left<(\\bar\\psi d_0 \\psi)^2\\right>-\\left<\\bar\\psi d_0 \\psi\\right>^2 ]",
    "\\\\ \\chi_{ie } & = & v [ \\left < p_i ( \\bar\\psi d_0 \\psi)\\right>-\\left < p_i\\right>\\left<\\bar\\psi d_0 \\psi\\right>]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 , @xmath11 is temporal component of the dirac operator and @xmath12 , @xmath13 indicate the average spacial and temporal plaquette respectively .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the specific heat and it can be expressed in term of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the susceptibility of the chiral condensate and only its disconnected component is taken into account in the present work .",
    "the first of these susceptibilities @xmath19 is defined in term of the disorder parameter introduced in @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 creates a magnetic charge defined by some given abelian projection and @xmath21 detects magnetic monopoles condensation .",
    "the parameter has been tested in quenched theory@xcite and it is well defined in full qcd@xcite .",
    "the independence from the chosen abelian projection has also been successfully tested@xcite .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath19 susceptibility is shown in fig.[rho ] . for @xmath23 @xmath19",
    "is size indipendent showing that @xmath24 ; for @xmath25 @xmath19 shows a growing linear with @xmath26 showing that @xmath21 is strictly zero in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "a power law fit of the @xmath19 peak as a function of @xmath26 gives a value for @xmath28 ( eq .  [ rhosca ] ) .",
    "other estimates for this exponent can be obtained from analogous fits ( fig .",
    "[ bc]-[chips ] ) for the pseudocritical coupling ( eq .  [ bcsca ] ) and the specific heat through @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( eq .  [ cvsca ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ bc]-[chips ] .",
    "result for the critical exponents are summarized in table  [ exp ] .",
    "these estimates tends to be greater than the expected values for @xmath6 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , @xmath7 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and mean field ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 )",
    ". moreover the exponent from @xmath19 seems to indicate a first order phase transition . as a consistency check",
    "one can fit the peak of @xmath18 to read back from data the assumed magnetic exponent @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ chips ] ) .",
    "also in this case we note a deviation from the starting value @xmath30 .",
    "we tested the @xmath6 scaling behavior and found it inconsistent with our data .",
    "a first order transition can not be excluded but our initial assumption for @xmath35 flaws the analysis .",
    "moreover the staggered fermion action at @xmath4 is probably plagued by large lattice artifacts that suppress the critical behavior .",
