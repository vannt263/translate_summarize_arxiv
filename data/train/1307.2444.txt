    "analytic objects associated with convergent sequences of combinatorial objects have recently been attracting a significant amount of attention .",
    "this line of research was initiated by the theory of limits of dense graphs  @xcite , followed by limits of sparse graphs  @xcite , permutations  @xcite , partial orders  @xcite , etc .",
    "further details can also be found in a recent monograph on graph limits of lovsz  @xcite .",

    "@xcite characterize testable properties and parameters of graph limits ( graphons ) and they identify a class of testable graph properties , so - called flexible properties . in this paper , we focus on a question when the limit analytic object is uniquely determined by finitely many densities of substructures . this phenomenon is known as finite forcibility .    in fact , questions of this kind are closely related to quasirandomness and",
    "they were studied well before the theory of limits of combinatorial objects emerged . for example",
    ", the results on pseudorandom graphs from work of chung , graham and wilson  @xcite , rdl  @xcite and thomason  @xcite imply that the homomorphic densities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 guarantee that densities of all subgraphs behave as in the random graph @xmath2 . in the language of graphons ( the limit structure for graphs )",
    ", this result asserts that the graphon identically equal to @xmath3 is finitely forcible by densities of @xmath4-vertex subgraphs .",
    "a similar result on permutations , which was originally raised as a question by graham , was proven by the last author and pikhurko  @xcite who exploited the analytic view of permutation limits .",
    "let us now give motivation for the concepts .",
    "the result on finite forcibility of the graphon identically equal to @xmath3 was generalized by lovsz and ss  @xcite who proved that any stepwise graphon is finitely forcible .",
    "these results were further extended by lovsz and szegedy  @xcite who also gave several conditions when a graphon is not finitely forcible .    in this paper , we are interested in finite forcibility of graph limits ( graphons ) and permutation limits ( permutons ) .",
    "we start with proving an analogue of the result of lovsz and ss  @xcite for permutons , which is stated as corollary  [ cor - force ] .",
    "we then focus on finite forcibility of permutons with infinite recursive structure , and on the interplay between finite forcibility of permutons and graphons , partly motivated by question  11 from  @xcite .",
    "a graph can be associated with a permutation in the following way : the vertices of the graph correspond to the elements of the permutation and two of them are joined by an edge if they form an inversion . along the same lines",
    ", a graphon can be associated with a permuton .",
    "for example , the graphon associated with the limit of random permutations is one of the candidates for a finite forcible `` 2-dimensional '' graphon ( see section  [ sec : concl ] for more details ) .",
    "unfortunately , we show that there exist finitely forcible permutons such that the associated graphons are not finitely forcible . in section  [ sect - infinite ] , we find two families of finitely forcible permutons , which have infinite recursive structure .",
    "then , we show that the associated graphons are not finitely forcible in section  [ sect - graphon ] , where we prove this result for all graphons with the recursive structure analogous to that of permutons from section  [ sect - infinite ] .",
    "still , we believe that some permutons leading to `` 2-dimensional '' graphons can be finitely forcible and we mention two particular cases at the end of the paper . also let us remark that the methods we use in section  [ sect - infinite ] were subsequently extended by jan volec and two of the authors  @xcite to resolve conjecture 9 from  @xcite on compactness of finitely forcible graphons .",
    "in this section , we introduce concepts related to graphs and permutations and their limits used in the paper .",
    "we start with the slightly simpler notion of permutation limits .",
    "the theory of permutation limits was built by hoppen , kohayakawa , moreira , rth and sampaio in  @xcite . here , we follow the analytic view of the limit as used in  @xcite , which also appeared in an earlier work of presutti and stromquist  @xcite .    a _ permutation of order _",

    "subpermutations are more commonly referred to as _ patterns _ but we decided to use the term subpermutation in the paper to be consistent with the analogous concept for graphs as well as with previous work on permutation limits . a _ density _ @xmath22 of a permutation @xmath15 of order @xmath16 in a permutation @xmath8 of order @xmath5 is the number of @xmath16-tuples inducing @xmath15 in @xmath8 divided by @xmath23 .",
