    "multicarrier techniques are based on the idea that a frequency - selective channel can be split into a number of flat orthogonal subchannels . as a result",
    ", sophisticated channel equalization schemes can be replaced by simple ( typically one - tap ) per - subcarrier equalizers .",
    "for this reason , both wired ( e.g. , digital subscriber line , powerline communications ) and wireless ( e.g. , wifi , wimax ) communications systems have long been employing multicarrier strategies in order to control intersymbol interference ( isi ) while limiting complexity @xcite .",
    "recently , established communications standards like lte have based also their multiple access features on a multicarrier approach @xcite . besides simple equalization , multicarrier transmission offers a flexible mechanism to dynamically allocate variable portions of the spectrum to users , according to their throughput requirements and the channel response .",
    "theoretically , it consists in a trivial assignment of subcarriers to users . in practice , however , things may become substantially more complicated , depending on the synchronization requirements between users and base station ( bs ) and , especially , among different users .    in  @xcite ,",
    "m.  morelli et  al .",
    "analyze the synchronization problem for the orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) scheme , which is probably the most common multicarrier multiple - access strategy based on an extension of the well - known circular prefix orthogonal frequency multiplexing ( cp - ofdm ) scheme .",
    "the authors highlight the fact that , similarly to cp - ofdm , ofdma suffers from poor spectrum containment and is hence very sensitive to frequency offsets .",
    "the issue is exacerbated in the uplink , since synchronism is needed among signals at the receiver side ( and not at the transmitters ) .",
    "timing- and frequency - tracking algorithms are presented in  @xcite , together with interference - cancellation procedures that are required to remove residual interference .",
    "the resulting receiver is thus a complex system and the inherent efficiency loss caused by the presence of the cp is not justified anymore .",
    "filterbank multicarrier ( fbmc ) modulation is an old technique ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) that is regaining popularity in the last few years as a potential solution to the efficiency and synchronization limitations of cp - ofdm and cp - ofdma @xcite . in fbmc ,",
    "orthogonality among subchannels is obtained by means of well - designed filters with low side lobes , and is much less sensitive to frequency offsets as shown in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , no cp is needed , thus improving the spectral efficiency",
    ". one should be aware , however , that one - tap per - subcarrier equalizers are not ideal anymore ( especially in highly frequency selective channels ) and more sophisticated solutions are often needed @xcite . for this reason , and because of fbmc architectures being more complex than their cp - ofdm counterparts , fbmc is still not very popular in point - to - point communications .",
    "on the other hand , the complexity gap cancels out ( or possibly reverses ) in multiple - access scenarios , as discussed above ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , users do not need to be synchronized since the timing at each subcarrier can be corrected separately .",
    "this paper considers a frequency selective multiple - access uplink channel as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenario ] and characterizes the distortion of the received symbols assuming an fbmc / oqam - based ofdma scheme .",
    "users are not synchronized and their channels towards the bs are highly frequency selective . no particular hypothesis is formulated about the fbmc prototype pulses , while a single - tap per - subcarrier equalizer is implemented .",
    "we mentioned before that this equalizer is suboptimal ; however , a rigorous mathematical analysis of more sophisticated receiver architectures would result in extremely complex derivations .",
    "moreover , single - tap equalizers are often used in real practical systems due to their simplicity .",
    "the resulting distortion is thus the joint effect of suboptimal equalization and a `` poor '' filter choice .",
    "as opposed to other works , where an empirical approach is preferred @xcite , the analysis below is based on a tight approximation that accurately represents the received signal when the number of subcarriers is large enough .",
    "this approximation is based on the results of @xcite and follows similar lines .",
    "it is worth remarking , however , that the problem at hand presents some specific difficulties that can not be seen as simple extensions of @xcite . indeed",
    ", important properties of the involved operations [ e.g. , of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) ] do not hold when the spectrum is not considered in its integrity , but is split among the different users .",
    "a fine characterization of the distortion brings valuable help with the design of an fbmc - based ofdma system .",
    "each user contributes not only to the distortion at its assigned subcarriers ( _ in - band distortion _ ) , but also at other users subcarriers ( _ out - band distortion _ ) .",
    "indeed , the interference caused by frequency selective channels , inherent to fbmc schemes , is exacerbated in the multiple user case since all users undergo different channels , whose combined effect may be unpredictable .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to confirm the intuition that , with sharp prototype pulses , leaving one empty subcarrier as a guard - band is sufficient @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also applies to prototype pulses that are not so frequency selective , like those used in double - dispersive channels and designed to optimize the time ",
    "frequency localization of the waveform @xcite .",
    "luckily , according to the results below , the number of subcarriers affected by the out - band leakage only depends on the prototype pulses at both sides of the fbmc links .",
    "conversely , channel responses , equalizer and synchronization misalignments only affect the distortion magnitude .",
    "this means that no channel state information is needed to choose the prototype pulses that minimize the leakage effect or to decide whether one or more empty guard - bands are needed between users .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : signal_model ] provides the model for the fbmc - based ofdma channel under consideration while recalling basic concepts of fbmc modulation .",
    "then , the derivation and the interpretation of the distortion approximation are reported in section  [ sec : distortion_analysis ] .",

    "if the prototype pulses are low - pass filters , the number of nonzero fourier coefficients is limited .",

    "summarizing the above discussion , an accurate design of the prototype pulses permits the out - band distortion to be confined within few subbands at the boundaries of the user of interest . a proper equalization ( e.g.  zero forcing )",

    "the overlapping factor is set to @xmath158 and the prototype pulse proposed by the eu - funded project phydyas @xcite , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] , is used at both the transmitter side and the receiver side . note that this pulse is not pr - compliant and , thus , the full distortion expression of appendix  [ sec : proof_dist ] shall be used .",
    "we also assume that two users are accessing the channel and that each of them is assigned 64 subcarriers ( subcarrier 1 to 64 to user  1 and subcarrier 65 to 128 to user 2 ) .",
    "the equalizer is tuned according to the zero - forcing principle on each user s subband , i.e.  @xmath129 for all @xmath42 .",

    "finally , the transmitted symbols are uniformly drawn from a 4qam constellation with power  @xmath136 .      in order to test the above results with different degrees of channel frequency selectivity",
