    "recent observations at sub - millimeter wavelengths have revealed a population of objects believed to be dusty high redshift far - infrared luminous galaxies ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ; barger et al . 1998 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; eales et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these sources emit most of their bolometric luminosity in the far - infrared ( fir ) , and are believed to account for a large portion of the far - infrared background ( e.g. blain 1999 ) .",
    "although detailed redshift information is still lacking for most of these sources , they are believed to be situated at @xmath4 .",

    "1998 ; blain 1999 ; scott et al .",
    "2002b ) , suggesting that the optically derived star formation density is significantly underestimated at high redshifts .",
    "this strong evolution is difficult to reproduce in semi - analytical hierarchical cold dark matter models ( devriendt & guiderdoni 2000 ; kaviani , haehnelt & kauffmann 2002 ) . assuming similar dust and fir properties between the high- and low - z objects , the cdm models under - estimate the observed number counts by almost two orders of magnitude ( kaviani et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "a remaining and central uncertainty in the discussion about the properties of the dusty high redshift population is their actual redshift distribution . despite detection of @xmath5100",
    "sub - millimeter sources , only a handful have secure optical or near - infrared counterparts ( cf .",
    "smail et al .",
    "this lack of counterparts shows that the submm sources are very faint ( r@xmath625 and k@xmath621 ) , making it difficult to obtain redshifts even with 8 - 10 m class telescopes , should the counterparts be identified .",
    "the presence of large amounts of dust also makes optical / nir photometric redshift determinations unreliable , should the continuum be detected .",
    "ultra - deep long wavelength radio continuum surveys have shown that many of the submm detected objects are related to weak radio sources ( smail et al .",
    "chapman et al .",
    "( 2002b ) find that @xmath72/3 of sources detected at 850@xmath1 m are also radio - identified at sub - mjy levels",
    ". for local galaxies there exists a very tight correlation between the long wavelength radio continuum and the far - infrared at 60@xmath1 m and 100@xmath1 m , extending over almost four orders of magnitude in luminosity ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism for this correlation is believed to be the formation of massive stars , which heats the dust through their uv radiation , producing the fir emission , and supernova explosions producing relativistic electrons which give synchrotron emission in the radio regime .",
    "based on this tight correlation between non - thermal radio and thermal far - infrared fluxes for local galaxies , carilli & yun ( 1999 ) devised a technique to use the radio - fir spectral index as a redshift indicator for distant submm sources .",
    "the technique uses the fact that for a fixed observed wavelength , the flux of synchrotron emission decreases with increasing redshift , while the opposite is true for the rayleigh - jeans part of the dust continuum .",
    "the first implementation used two local starburst galaxies as templates ( see also barger et al .",
    "1998 ) . a follow - up study ( carilli & yun 2000 ) used 17 low - z star - forming galaxies as templates .",
    "the result is a submm - radio spectral index which depends on the redshift of the source .",
    "there are several caveats with this radio - fir relation .",
    "the spectral index depends not only on the redshift of the source , but also on several other parameters , most notably the dust temperature , and the radio continuum spectral index , for instance non - thermal vs. thermal contributions and the possible presence of an agn .",
    "the decrease of the observed radio continuum with increasing redshift makes it increasingly demanding to detect the sources as @xmath8 increases .",
    "the radio - fir relation is therefore practical up to @xmath9 .",
    "dunne et al . ( 2001 ) discuss the various dependencies , comparing with a local sample of fir bright galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , although the radio - fir technique is too crude to be used as a photometric redshift indicator for individual sources , becomes unreliable at @xmath10 , and care has to be exercised in order not to include radio - loud agns , it has proven that the submm detected sources , seen as a class , are indeed situated at high redshifts .",
    "very little is known about these sources from other wavelength bands , therefore this information has been crucial for establishing the presence of a high redshift population of dusty , luminous and , in the few known cases , massive galaxies .",
    "several authors have speculated on the possibility of using two or more wavelength bands in the sub - millimeter as a mean of deriving photometric redshifts ( e.g. hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; blain 1999 ; blain , barnard & chapman 2002 ) .",
    "the conclusion has been that this is unfeasable due to a degeneracy between the redshift and dust temperature ( see sect .",
    "[ degeneracy ] ) . in a recent study by hughes et al .",
    "( 2002 ) the submm photometric method is revived using local starburst galaxies and a statistical treatment .    in this paper an alternative method for determining the redshift of submm detected sources is presented , using only the rayleigh - jeans part of the dust sed .",
    "it is based on the existence of a template sed for local ulirgs , which shows a remarkably uniform shape at wavelengths @xmath11m@xmath12 m . assuming that ultraluminous ir galaxies at high redshift have similar properties , the flux ratio of two submm bands , for instance at 850@xmath1 m and 450@xmath1 m , is thus sensitive to the redshift of the source in the range @xmath2 .",
    "a comparison with submm flux ratios for a sample of high - z agns ( mostly gravitationally lensed ) shows that this technique is accurate enough to allow a redshift determination to within @xmath730% . with the advent of new submm telescopes and instruments , such as apex ( atacama pathfinder experiment ) , alma ( atacama large millimeter array ) and scuba ii , some of them capable of operating up to 325@xmath1 m",
    ", the use of submm flux ratios is foreseen to become a technique to quickly estimate approximate redshifts of large numbers of submm detected sources .",
    "in this section i will briefly discuss dust spectral energy distributions and how these can be used to describe physical properties of unresolved dust sources observed in the ir - to - submm .",
    "the main conclusion is that extreme care has to be exercised when doing this interpretation since it can easily lead to wrong inferences about dust mass and the physical size of the emitting region .",
    "the far - infrared spectral energy distribution of dust emission is purely thermal and usually represented by a modified blackbody curve , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the planck function , @xmath15 the dust temperature and @xmath16 is the grain emissivity power - law index .",
    "the index is in the range @xmath17 .",
    "a single - size and uniform grain composition would lead to @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath19 it is indicative of a distribution of grain sizes and/or compositions .",
    "such simple representation has successfully been used for cold dust components where a large part of the sed is optically thin .",
    "when @xmath20 or larger , the observed dust emission needs to be described by an expression of the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the solid angle of the source emissivity distribution and @xmath23 is the opacity of the dust .",
    "setting @xmath24 gives @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "the critical frequency @xmath29 is the frequency where @xmath30 .",

    "an estimate of the dust mass from the infrared flux requires either optically thin emission combined with a knowledge of the grain properties , or optically thick emission and a knowledge of the geometry of the emission region ( cf .",
    "hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "the grain properties are characterized through the macroscopic mass absorption coefficient , @xmath41 ( cf .",
    "hughes , dunlop & rawlins 1997 ) . combining several estimates ( cf , hildebrand 1983 ; hughes et al .",
    "1997 ) , the mass absorption coefficient can be described as : @xmath42 this expression corresponds to a grain composition similar to that found in the milky way . at frequencies where the emission is optically thin ,",
    "the dust mass can now be determined from @xmath43 which can be expressed as : @xmath44      in reality , it is likely that a galaxy contains several different dust components each characterized by a different set of parameters .",
    "lacking observational data with sufficient spatial resolution , it is usually assumed that the dust emission can be decomposed into three main components ( e.g. rowan - robinson 1986 , 1992 ) ; cool dust associated with a cirrus component heated by the diffuse interstellar radiation field , warm dust associated with regions of massive star formation , and , if the galaxy harbors an agn , a hot component representing dust heated by the central agn .",
    "these three dust components will dominate the submm , fir and mid - ir wavelength regimes , respectively .",
    "there are , however , no assumptions about their actual sizes or their geometries .",
    "more elaborate models solve the radiation of transfer in a dusty medium containing heating sources ( e.g. granato , danese & franceschini 1996 ; efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen 2000 ) . due to the large number of parameters , involving dust variables as a function of the geometry",
    ", these methods can only be safely applied to sources and parts of the sed which are known to be associated with a single heating source , e.g. an agn .",
    "the representation of the dust sed discussed in sect .",
    "[ models ] involves four parameters per component .",
    "since most observed seds contain only a few data points , a fit of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is prone to a relatively large degree of freedom , especially if more than one dust component is used .",
    "moreover , at long wavelengths there exists a degeneracy between the dust temperature @xmath15 and the grain emissivity power - law index @xmath45 ( e.g. blain et al .",
    "this degeneracy is difficult to resolve without an observationally well sampled sed .    due to the observationally",
    "sparsely sampled dust seds , the dust emission is often characterized by fitting a single component .",
    "this usually gives a reasonable fit to the observed data points , but should not be over - interpreted in terms of physical conditions of the dust grains or of global dust parameters , especially dust mass .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dustseds ] where the dust sed of the local ulirg 17208 - 0014 has been fitted using both one and two dust component seds of the type described above ( see also klaas et al .",
    "the single component sed is characterized by a dust temperature of 59 k and an exponent @xmath46 .",
    "the two component sed has warm dust grains characterized by a temperature of 53 k and @xmath47 , and a cool component with t@xmath48 k and @xmath49 .",
    "while the two component sed has critical frequencies @xmath29 corresponding to 35@xmath1 m and 51@xmath1 m , respectively , the single component sed becomes optically thick already at 214@xmath1 m .",
    "both models give approximately the same l@xmath50 , showing that they describe the _ shape _ of the sed reasonably well .",
    "the single component sed , however , gives a total dust mass which is 3.5 times smaller than the two - component sed .",
    "this is due to the highly non - linear relation between m@xmath51/l@xmath50 as a function of dust temperature ; while m@xmath52 , ( approximately @xmath53 at long wavelengths ) , the luminosity l@xmath54 .",
    "it is thus possible to ` hide ' a large amount of dust in a low temperature component . in terms of typical size scales ,",
    "the cool dust extends over an area which is @xmath7150 times larger than the warm component .    although the resulting @xmath55 values for the fits shown in fig .",
    "[ dustseds ] are similar , they describe dust components with widely different physical properties .",
    "the two fits , however , both give a satisfactory description of the overall _ shape _ of the sed .",
    "this is important to keep in mind when discussing and comparing dust properties of different types of objects , and , as argued here , when constructing a template sed .",
    "lowering the temperature of a modified blackbody curve is equivalent to shifting the entire spectrum towards longer wavelengths .",
    "a similar shift can be achieved by keeping the temperature constant but moving the source to a larger redshift .",
    "hence , without knowing the dust temperature apriori , it is impossible to distinguish between a source at large redshift with a given t@xmath56 and a source at low redshift with a dust sed characterized by a lower temperature ( e.g. blain 1999 ; eales et al . 1999 ; blain , barnard & chapman 2002 ) .    in order to use two flux densities at the fir",
    "/ submm part of a dust sed to determine a photometric redshift of the source , it is thus necessary to know the shape of the sed in sufficient detail .",
    "this can be done if the global physical parameters for the emission can be established .",
    "if this is not the case , the degeneracy between the dust temperature and redshift makes progress essentially impossible .",
    "the effect of this degeneracy is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ specind ] for a simple dust sed .",
    "the ratio of flux densities at 325@xmath1 m and 850@xmath1 m of a single component modified blackbody function ( given by eq  [ eq1 ] ) are plotted as a function of redshift .",
    "the result for six different dust temperatures between 30 k and 80 k are shown . despite the fact that the gradient of the flux ratio as a function of redshift is quite steep , the effect of the dust temperature precludes its use as a redshift indicator unless t@xmath56 is known .",
    "attempts to characterize local fir luminous galaxies in terms of dust parameters show a relatively broad range in t@xmath56 and @xmath45 ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ; klaas et al .",
    "as shown above , a sparsely sampled dust sed can be equally well modeled with one and two component dust seds , with different sets of dust parameters , leading to an even larger spread in parameter values for different sources .",
    "similarly good fits can also be achieved for different dust temperatures by varying the index @xmath45 .",
    "the _ shape _ , however , remains basically identical and the ratio of fir / submm flux densities are approximately the same for the various fits .",
    "local ulirgs are characterized by a dominating fir luminosity , l@xmath57 l@xmath58 , large dust masses , large molecular gas masses and signs of strong gravitational interaction and/or merging ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ; rigopoulou et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the dust and gas is strongly concentrated to the central regions of the galaxies ( downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "the heating source of the large fir luminosity is in many cases pure star formation , but a significant fraction of all ulirgs also contain an agn ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "1999 ; klaas et al .",

    "the assumption made here of the existence of a template sed is exactly the same as done when using the radio - fir spectral index method ( carilli & yun 1999 , 2000 ) . the main difference between the two method is that the fir sed method does not need to exclude radio - loud agns , and it works out to redshifts @xmath90 .",

    "the observed submm flux is much lower than expected from the radio continuum flux ( carilli & yun 1999 ) .",
    "the sample used here consists of a mixture of pure starburst and agns systems ( klaas et al .",
    "2001 ) ; 8 are designated as starburst systems , 13 as liners , 8 as seyferts ( 2 sy 1 and 6 sy 2 ) , and 8 remain unassigned of a spectral class . as discussed above ,",
    "the presence of an agn is most evident in the mid - ir range and not at @xmath91 m .    an alternative photometric redshift method for use with fir and submm observations",
    "was presented by hughes et al .",
    "this method use a large number of template seds , containing both starburst systems and agns , spanning a large range of intrinsic luminosities . the local iras 60@xmath1 m luminosity function",
    "is evolved with redshift to explain the observed number - counts .",
    "the luminosity function is then randomly populated by the seds from the template catalog .",
    "photometric redshifts are determined by calculating the probability that the colors of an observed submm source are consistent with the colors of every template sed at a given redshift .",
    "no correlation between the sed , luminosity and redshift is assumed . while models of this kind incorporate lower luminosity objects , the existing instrumentation limits detection of high redshift objects to the most luminous ones . until submm observations can routinely be done with rms noise levels of 0.1mjy or lower , and in view of a possible luminosity - temperature relation ,",
    "it seems prudent to restrict the template to objects with luminosities large enough to be detectable at high redshifts .      the flux density ratio 450@xmath1m/850@xmath1 m , derived from the template , as a function of redshift is shown in fig .  [ data450 ] .",
    "also shown are measured flux density ratios for high - z sources with known spectroscopic redshifts ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "six of these are taken from a survey of gravitationally lensed agns ( barvainis & ivison 2002 ) .",
    "three are submm detected galaxies with known redshift : smm02399 - 0136 at @xmath92 ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) , smm02399 - 0134 at @xmath93 and smm1411 + 0252 at @xmath94 ( ivison et al .",
    "two sources detected by iso at 170@xmath1 m ( chapman et al .",
    "2002 ) : fn1 - 40 at @xmath95 and fn1 - 64 at @xmath96 .",
    "two additional gravitational lenses are also included , f10214 + 4724 at @xmath97 ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1993 ) and apm08279 + 5255 at @xmath98 ( irwin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the iso sources are situated at relatively small redshifts and still have large uncertainties associated with their observed 450@xmath1 m flux densities .",
    "their predicted redshifts with the present photometric method are therefore uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , the present method achieves a better result than the radio - fir method which predicts redshifts of 1.1 and 1.3 instead of the spectroscopically derived 0.45 and 0.9 .    most of the sources shown in fig .",
    "[ data450 ] and listed in table  [ table1 ] are gravitationally lensed and it is possible that differential magnification can distort the flux density ratios .",
    "this can happen if the emission regions dominating at 450@xmath1 m has a smaller spatial extent than that of 850@xmath1 m .",
    "the effect would be to enhance the 450@xmath1 m flux relative to that at 850@xmath1 m and move the data points upwards in the diagram .",
    "this , however , is only expected to be of concern for the most strongly lensed sources . indeed , the data points deviating significantly from the expected ratios are due to the strongest lenses ( f10214 + 4724 and apm08279 + 5255 ) .",
    "another deviant source is smmj02399 - 0134 with a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath93 , where the indicated photometric redshift is @xmath99 ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this , however , is a redshift where the present method is less accurate due to the relatively small redshift .",
    "apart from these three sources , the agreement with the redshift expected from the template model is good .    the low redshift sample of dunne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) generally fall below the predicted flux density ratio ( given their redshift ) .",
    "this sample , however , only contains two sources which can be classified as ulirg and hence , is not expected to conform to the ulirg template .",
    "in particular , their average dust temperature is considerably lower ( dunne et al .",
    "2001 ) , in agreement with a possible luminosity - temperature relation .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the photometric redshifts are given with the errors calculated as a convolution of the photometric uncertainty and the 95% confidence limit derived from the template sed .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts are compared graphically in fig .",
    "[ compfig ] .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the errors associated with the 450@xmath1 m flux densities rather than the spread in template flux ratios .",
    "ultimately it is preferable to determine the redshift of all the submm detected galaxies spectroscopically . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intro ] this is in most cases very difficult due to the very weak emission at optical and nir wavelengths .",
    "an alternative method will become available when alma ( atacama large millimeter array ) comes on - line .",
    "the sensitivity of this interferometer will be high enough to allow detection of co emission from high redshift objects in a relatively short observing time ( blain et al . 2000 )",
    ". the instantaneous wavelength coverage will be much larger than present day instruments .",
    "the projected bandwidth is 16 ghz , corresponding to a redshift intervall @xmath100 in the 3 mm atmospheric window .",
    "although still relatively limited , it represents an order of magnitude improvement to existing millimeter and submillimeter instruments .",
    "the 3 mm atmospheric window is ideal for searching for high redshift co emission . except for a redshift intervall @xmath101 , there will always be at least one co rotational transition within @xmath102 ghz .",
    "for redshift @xmath103 there will be at least two transitions within the band .",
    "if the photometric errors can be reduced to such a level that the uncertainty in the photometric redshift is dominated by the dispersion in template sed , the redshift uncertainty would be @xmath730% for redshifts",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ deltafig ] , where @xmath105 is plotted as a function of redshift for the 95% and 90% confidence limit of the template sed . also shown in fig .",
    "[ deltafig ] are the corresponding @xmath105 values of four co transitions as observed in the 3 mm band with the projected alma receiver bandwidth of 16 ghz .",
    "the 3 mm band used here stretches from 80 ghz to 116 ghz , although the first receiver implementation is likely to cover a somewhat smaller band .",
    "using higher frequencies results in a smaller redshift coverage and does not cover the rotational transitions believed to give the strongest signal ( e.g. combes , maoli & omont 1999 ) .",
    "for the highest redshifts covered by the 3 mm band , and thus the higher j - transitions , the redshift uncertainty in the photometric method is comparable or smaller than the redshift coverage of the alma bandwidth .",
    "for lower redshifts it will be necessary to use two tunings in order to brackett a photometrically estimated redshift .",
    "improvements of the photometric redshift method may remedy this , making it possible to use a single tuning of alma when searching for redshifted co emission even for lower redshift sources .",
    "despite a serious degeneracy between the dust temperature and the redshift for a modified blackbody curve , it is shown that an average dust spectral energy distribution , based on a local sample of ultraluminous ir galaxies , can be used for photometric redshift determination in the intervall @xmath2 .    the local sample of ultraluminous ir galaxies ( klaas et al . 2001 )",
    "shows a remarkably small dispersion in the shape of the sed at wavelengths longward of @xmath106 m .",
    "the local sample contains both starburst and agn dominated sources .    using this template and the internal dispersion in its shape",
    ", it is shown that observations at two fixed submm wavelengths , e.g. 450@xmath1 m and 850@xmath1 m , can be used to determine the photometric redshift of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath2 . the uncertainty in the redshift arising from the template sed amounts to @xmath3 , with an improvement at the highest redshift range .",
