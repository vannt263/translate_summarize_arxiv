    "in high energy heavy ion collision experiments it is believed that a new state of matter , the so - called quark gluon plasma , may be created ( @xcite , @xcite ) . theoretically it is therefore important to understand the time evolution of dense strongly interacting matter towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "this evolution can be described in terms of the gluon occupation number f. in the very early stages after a collision f is of the order @xmath3 ( @xcite , @xcite ) where @xmath4 is the strong coupling constant . as the system evolves f decreases and",
    "is finally of the order 1 at equilibrium .",
    "unfortunately there is no general theoretical framework to describe the complete evolution . for large f ( i.e. very early times )",
    "non - linear classical field theory can be applied while a boltzmann equation that takes quantum fluctuations into account ( this will be called full or  quantum  boltzmann equation ) may be used near equilibrium .    in order to obtain a continuous description of the evolution",
    "one may try to fit the transition between the two approaches by a classical field approximation of the full boltzmann equation ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    however , it is a priori not clear that these transitions are as smooth as the above figure suggests . in this paper",
    "we compare the classical and quantum boltzmann equations in high energy qcd and show that they are equivalent to orders @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the comparison of non - linear classical fields with the classical boltzmann equation is an entirely different problem and will not be treated here .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the main results of mueller and son @xcite where the basis for our considerations is developed within a scalar field theory . in section 3",
    "we generalize their strategy to high energy qcd and show that one obtains essentially the same results .",
    "we want to emphasize that our argumentations are mostly qualitative . perhaps surprisingly",
    ", we need very few computations to derive our results ; some simple topological and diagrammatical considerations are sufficient .",
    "similar methods can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the scalar field theory with @xmath0 interaction given by the lagrangian @xmath7 throughout this paper we assume coupling constants to be small and perform the relevant computations in first order perturbation theory .",
    "our ultimate interest will be to gain deeper insight into the time evolution of heavy ion collisions .",
    "so we have to generalize our theory to finite temperature .",
    "it is convenient to apply the closed time path formalism ( ctp ) which leads to a doubling of the field variables ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10,@xmath11 .",
    "the lagrangian then reads @xmath12 we now perform a change of the field variables in order to distinguish the classical field ( denoted @xmath13 ) and quantum fluctuations ( denoted @xmath14 ) @xmath15 @xmath16 as we are interested in systems where both @xmath11 and @xmath10 are large , the above interpretations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are already at least qualitatively justified .    in terms of these new fields",
    "the lagrangian becomes @xmath17 indeed , it can be easily shown now by neglecting higher than linear terms in @xmath14 that @xmath13 fulfills the classical equation of motion ( for details see @xcite ) @xmath18    from the lagrangian ( 5 ) one can identify the vertices of the theory ( fig .",
    "the full lines correspond to the classical field @xmath13 and the dashed lines to the quantum fluctuations @xmath14 .",
    "the diagram on the left will be called classical vertex , the right one quantum vertex",
    ".    the most important quantities for our argumentations will be the free greens functions or propagators for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 fields , respectively . in a more rigorous discussion",
    "one should adopt the full propagators , but mass corrections are negligible as long as the coupling constant is small enough , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "( for details on this point see @xcite . )",
    "note that there are also mixed propagators describing the change from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and vice versa .",
    "one obtains    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22",
    "@xmath23    the crucial observation here is that only @xmath24 depends on the occupation number f.      the boltzmann equation describes the time evolution of the occupation number f of a given state as the difference between the scattering of particles into and out of this state ( gain and loss ) .",
    "these scatterings are included in the collision term c. considering the scalar field theory ( 1 ) one may express the collision term to lowest order diagrammatically ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    for a detailed analysis of the boltzmann equation in scalar and gauge field theories see @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to examine the topology of the involved diagrams and it is easy to see that these are effectively sunset graphs ( fig .",
    "when we express now our theory in terms of @xmath13 and @xmath14 we use the corresponding vertices .",
    "the classical approximation then consists in retaining only collision term diagrams without quantum vertices .",
    "there are three different classical diagrams ( fig . 5 ) .    in fig .",
    "5 the left diagram is proportional to @xmath25 as three propagators @xmath24 appear .",
    "( here and in the following empty circles appear in propagators while full circles stand for vertices . )",
    "similarly , the other graphs are proportional to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .    in the full boltzmann equation",
    "one also has to include the diagrams with one quantum vertex ( fig .",
    "6 ) .    in fig.6",
    "the left diagram is proportional to @xmath27 while the others are independent of f.    there are no first order diagrams with two quantum vertices as at least one propagator @xmath28 would appear .",
    "so we can conclude that classical field theory and the boltzmann equation are equivalent in orders @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xcite ) . in the next section",
    "we will show how this strategy can be generalized to qcd of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the results of the previous section may be generalized to qcd by making two approximations which are well established in the context of heavy ion collisions .",
    "first , we will work within the gluon saturation scenario ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this means that we may neglect the fermionic degrees of freedom in our system .",
    "so the qcd lagrangian simplifies considerably and reads in the ctp formalism    @xmath29 +   \\frac{1}{4}f_a^{\\mu\\nu}f_{a\\mu\\nu}[a_{a\\mu}^+]\\quad .\\ ] ]    here the letter  a  is a color index and @xmath30 the gluon field . in analogy to the field transformation in the scalar case",
    "we now define @xmath31 @xmath32    this leads to the following expression for @xmath33 @xmath34 and similarly for @xmath35 .",
    "next we express the lagrangian ( 11 ) in terms of the fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 . neglecting higher than linear terms in the quantum fluctuations @xmath37 one obtains    @xmath38)\\pi_\\nu^a\\ ] ]    with    @xmath39    @xmath40 \\equiv   \\partial^\\mu \\phi^\\nu_{b } -   \\partial^\\nu \\phi^\\mu_{b } +   gf^{bcd}\\phi^\\mu_{c}\\phi^\\nu_{d } \\quad .\\ ] ]",
    "thus , @xmath36 fulfills the classical equation of motion    @xmath41 = 0 \\quad .\\ ] ]    so our interpretation of @xmath36 as classical field is justified in complete analogy to the scalar case .    from the equations ( 15 ) to ( 17 ) one also sees that there is only one classically allowed vertex in first order in the coupling constant g ( fig .",
    "7 ) .    here",
    "full lines denote classical fields and dashed lines quantum corrections like in the previous section .    in order to obtain the quantum couplings one has to take into account the terms nonlinear in @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian may be easily computed and reads    @xmath42    so we have one first order quantum coupling ( fig . 8) .",
    "our second approximation leads to a simple topology of the collision term c. as fermions are neglected the only contributions to c come from gluon scattering .",
    "we now assume that the t - channel dominates , where t is the mandelstam variable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( in fact , our only assumption is to work in the high energy limit where both approximations are valid . )",
    "the t - channel gluon scattering is shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "this makes the relevant collision term topology quite simple as can be seen in fig .",
    "10 ( note that in contrast to the previous section only three - field vertices are present ) .",
    "as the main features of the propagators do not change , especially @xmath43 and @xmath28 , we are now again ready to compare classical field theory with the full boltzmann equation . as before the classical approximation",
    "consists in neglecting diagrams with quantum vertices which are only taken into account in the full collision term .",
    "let us consider for example the diagram in fig .",
    "11 that clearly has the required topology .",
    "it contains one quantum vertex so it is not included in the classical approximation .",
    "the contribution from this graph to the collision term is proportional to @xmath44 as one propagator @xmath24 appears .",
    "similarly , the diagram in fig .",
    "12 is classical and proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "it is easy to check that these examples give already the highest order contributions to the classical approximation and the quantum corrections , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the results of the scalar case are indeed valid in high energy qcd : the classical field approximation and the quantum boltzmann equation match in orders @xmath5 and @xmath6 , i.e. in leading orders of the gluon occupation number .",
