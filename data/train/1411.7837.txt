    "steering was initially introduced by schrdinger @xcite in response to the famous epr paradox proposed by einstein , podolsky , and rosen in 1935 @xcite .",
    "the paradox describes that two remote observers alice and bob share a pair of entangled particles and one observer , say alice , can prepare the state of bob s particle via different types of measurements on her own particle .",
    "steering was termed as alice s ability to nonlocally control bob s state via local measurements .",
    "recently , steering has been revisted and rigorously formulated in refs .",
    "the violation of a local hidden - state model for sceptical bob demonstrates steering from alice to bob .",
    "it shows that bell - nonlocal states violating bell inequality @xcite are subset of the steerable states which in turn are a subset of the inseparable states .",
    "steering embodies a kind of quantum correlations intermediate between entanglement and bell nonlocality .",
    "any demonstration of epr paradox is also a demonstration of steering and vice versa @xcite .",
    "epr paradox was firstly realized by ou et al @xcite and steering has recently been experimentally realized in different systems @xcite . besides being of fundamental interest ,",
    "quantum steering is useful for quantum information such as quantum cryptography @xcite .    inherently distinct from entanglement and bell",
    "nonlocality , steering is intrinsically asymmetric between the two observers .",
    "that is , the roles played in steering by alice and bob are not exchangeable .",
    "very interestingly , recent theoretical and experimental works have verified there exists asymmetric steering , i.e. one - way steering , which allows alice s steering the state of bob s particle but the reverse bob - to - alice steering is impossible .",
    "this one - way steering reflects the asymmetry of quantum correlations .",
    "one - way gaussian steering has been experimentally achieved by controlling unequal losses of two entangled beams @xcite , and theoretical studies have also revealed this asymmetric steering in several systems of continuous and discrete variables @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for realizing one - way gaussian steering of two electromagnetic fields by optomechanics with continuous pumps . in the past decade , considerable progress has been made in the field of quantum optomechanics @xcite .",
    "quantum ground - state cooling of mechanical oscillators @xcite , mechanically - induced squeezing @xcite , and optomechanical entanglement @xcite have been achieved .",
    "it makes optomechanical interfaces a very promising platform for demonstrating various quantum phenomena .",
    "our system consists of two driven electromagnetic cavities mediated by a mechanical oscillator .",
    "photon entanglement in such optomechanical interfaces has been studied in detail @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the steerability and asymmetry of the photon correlations .",
    "the conditions for achieving one - way steering in different directions for the cases of weak and strong mechanical damping are identified .",
    "our scheme can realize hybrid microwave - optical steering in optoelectromechanical interface .",
    "we consider a double cavity optomechanical system in which two separate cavity fields of frequencies @xmath0 are mediated by a mechanical oscillator at frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the cavity fields , driven by coherent fields of frequencies @xmath2 , can be optical modes @xcite , microwave modes @xcite , or both @xcite ( see fig.1 ( a ) ) .",
    "in particular , a recent experiment has realized the reversible transfer between microwave and optical photons with a mechanical element .",
    "this optoelectromechanical interface may allow for quantum information processing with light at different wavelengths by exploiting microwave - optical quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "strong photon nonlinearity can also be achieved in such a setup , as studied in ref.@xcite . for strong driving fields ,",
    "the linearized hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath3 , \\label{ham1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bosonic operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the cavity and mechanical modes , respectively , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the effective cavity - drive detunings and optomechanical couplings . the couplings @xmath7 are controllable via changing the drive strengths .",
    "we consider that the cavity field 1 and 2 are resonant with the red and blue sidebands of the driving fields , respectively , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in an interaction picture with respect to @xmath10 and under the rotation - wave approximation ( rwa ) , the hamiltonian of eq.([ham1 ] )",
    "becomes into @xmath11 the parametric downconversion can bring about the optomechanical entanglement , while the upconversion induces quantum - state transfer between the cavity field 2 and the mechanical oscillator .",
    "these two combined processes lead to the entanglement between the two cavity fields .",
    "the above hamiltonian represents a typical three - mode parametric interaction and can be realized in some other bosonic systems @xcite , e.g. atomic ensembles coupled to optical fields @xcite , apart from the optomechanical interfaces .",
    "our results are therefore generic and applicable to these systems .",
    "the system s operators are governed by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the dissipation rates of the cavity and mechanical modes .",
    "the noise operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 satisfy nonzero correlations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 the temperature and @xmath22 the boltzmann constant .",
    "note that the hamiltonian of eq.([ham2 ] ) under the rwa is only valid under the condition @xmath23 with the routh - hurwitz criterion , the stability condition of eq.([lan1 ] ) can be found to be @xmath24>(\\kappa_1+\\gamma_m)g_1 ^ 2,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\kappa_1g_2 ^ 2-\\kappa_2g_1 ^ 2+\\gamma_m\\kappa_1\\kappa_2>0.\\label{stcond}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "for the quadrature operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the heisenberg uncertainty relations are @xmath27 , where the variances @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "according to refs.@xcite , the epr paradox and steering of bipartite gaussian states are achievable on gaussian measurements when @xmath30 or @xmath31 the inferred variances @xmath32 are @xmath33=v\\big[\\hat { \\mathcal o}_{1(2)}\\big]-v^2(\\hat { \\mathcal o}_1 , \\hat { \\mathcal o}_2)/v\\big[\\hat { \\mathcal o}_{2(1)}\\big]$ ] .",
    "the condition @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) means the steerability from the cavity field 2 ( 1 ) to the field @xmath36 ( 2 ) .",
    "one - way steering occurs when only one of the above two inequalities holds .    specifically , for our system the steady average values @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see appendix [ ap1 ] ) .",
    "the steering criteria of eqs.([str12 ] ) and ( [ str21 ] ) then reduce respectively to @xmath39 and @xmath40 while the entanglement between the cavity fields measured by logarithmic negativity @xcite requires ( see appendix [ ap2 ] ) @xmath41 we see that nonclassical correlations between the two fields are necessary for the entanglement and steering and moreover stronger nonclassical correlations are required for achieving the steering than that for the entanglement .",
    "it therefore exemplifies that steerable states are strictly inseparable but not necessarily vice versa .",
    "at first , we consider the case that @xmath43 such that we can temporarily neglect the mechanical damping at zero temperature for simplicity",
    ". then , the steering conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the steady cavity states reduce respectively to @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are incompatible . the condition for the steady - state entanglement reduces to @xmath46 for the same cavity losses ( @xmath47 ) , both eq.([st122 ] ) and ( [ st212 ] ) can not be held and therefore the steady entangled cavity - field states are definitely not steerable at zero mechanical damping . for different cavity loss rates ,",
    "the directions of one - way steering depends on the ratio of @xmath48 .",
    "we see that the one - way steering from the cavity field 2 to the cavity field 1 ( @xmath34 and @xmath49 ) may be achieved when @xmath50 , whereas the reverse one - way steering may occur when @xmath51 .",
    "this result is plotted in fig.[case1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) by considering @xmath52 , and it shows that steady - state one - way steering in two ways can be obtained , apart from the transient two - way steering ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) . we thus conclude that in the steady - state regime only the cavity field with larger dissipation rate can be steered by the other one . this is because that in the absence of the mechanical damping , the field under larger dissipation has smaller steady - state mean photon number and also smaller quantum fluctuations .",
    "this field is therefore more easier steered by the other one ( since it has larger fluctuations and thus smaller inferred variances of the steered field ) .",
    "[ case1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) plot the dependence of the minimized @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( maximized steering ) , with respect to the couplings @xmath55 and @xmath48 in the steady - state regime , on @xmath56 at nonzero temperature .",
    "we see that the one - way steering from the field 2 to 1 is much more robust against thermal fluctuations than the reverse one .",
    "this is due to that the thermal input leads to the much more enhancement of the mean photon number @xmath57 than that of @xmath58 via the beam - splitter interaction of the cavity field @xmath59 with the mechanical mode coupled to the thermal reservoir .",
    "therefore , even for the environment with large thermal phonon number , the one - way field 2-to-1 steering can also be achievable .",
    "this shows that the present scheme can realize asymmetric steering without precooling the mechanical oscillator to its ground state .",
    "we next study the role played by the strong mechanical damping in steering . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the cavity dissipation rates @xmath61 . in this case and at zero temperature , the steady - state entanglement is always present and the steering condition @xmath35 reduces to @xmath62 , \\label{str213}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath63 .",
    "it shows that for @xmath64 , weak mechanical damping can still lead to the cavity field 1-to-2 steering .",
    "meanwhile , the steering condition @xmath34 becomes approximately into @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath64 , the right hand of eq.([str123 ] ) is larger than that of eq.([str213 ] ) and therefore the one - way steering from the cavity field 1 to 2 can be obtained for @xmath14 violating eq.([str123 ] ) .",
    "this is shown in fig.[case2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we see that strong mechanical damping in vacuum leads to the steady - state cavity field 1-to-2 one - way steering and its strength is impaired by thermal mechanical noise .",
    "the maximum obtainable steering is larger than that in the case of weak mechanical damping in fig .",
    "[ case1 ] .",
    "in addition , we find that in this regime of strong mechanical damping , the reverse one - way steering from the cavity field 2 to 1 is unobtainable ( see below for reason ) and strong two - way steering can be achieved by minimizing @xmath67 and @xmath68 with respect to @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] in the appendix ) .    to show the mechanical damping can lead to the asymmetric cavity states",
    ", we perform a transformation @xmath70 where the two - mode squeezing operator @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 , giving @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in terms of the operators @xmath75 , the equations of eq.([lan1 ] ) become into @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , where the noise operators @xmath79 satisfy the nonzero correlations @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "we see that the composite mode @xmath83 is decoupled to the mechanical oscillator interacting with the mode @xmath84 via @xmath85 and the two modes @xmath75 are coupled to a two - mode squeezed vacuum reservoir ( see fig.1 ( b ) ) .",
    "the symmetry of the cavity field states depends on that of @xmath84 and @xmath83 modes . for zero mechanical damping",
    ", the the two composite modes reduce to reservoir s state and thus symmetric .",
    "however , at finite mechanical damping in vacuum the mode @xmath84 is cooled down and we have @xmath86 , which results in the violation of eq.([eqstr12 ] ) more easily than that of eq.([eqstr21 ] ) and thus the one - way steering of the field 2 by the field 1 .",
    "we note that a large mechanical damping rate can be obtained by using a low - quality mechanical oscillator with high resonant frequency .",
    "alternately , it can also be achieved by weakly coupling a high - quality mechanical oscillator to a bad electromagnetic cavity to induce an optical heating for the mechanical oscillator , as analyzed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "we finally consider the steering spectra of the output fields which are utilized for measurements and applications . by performing the fourier transformation @xmath87d\\omega/\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ ] on eq.([lan1 ] ) and using the input - output relations @xmath88 , we have @xmath89=&m_{11}\\hat a_1^{\\rm in}[\\omega ] + m_{12}\\hat a_2^{\\rm in\\dag}[-\\omega]+m_{1b } \\hat b^{\\rm in\\dag}[-\\omega],\\nonumber \\\\ \\hat a_2^{\\rm out}[\\omega]= & -m_{12 } \\hat a_1^{\\rm in\\dag}[-\\omega ] + m_{22}\\hat a_2^{\\rm in}[\\omega ] + m_{2b}\\hat b^{\\rm in}[\\omega].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the expressions for @xmath90 and @xmath91 and the calculation of the steering spectra @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] are given in appendix [ ap4 ] .",
    "at zero mechanical damping , we have @xmath94a_1^{\\rm out}[\\omega]\\big\\rangle=\\big\\langle\\hat a_2^{\\rm out\\dag}[\\omega]a_2^{\\rm out}[\\omega]\\big\\rangle=\\big|m_{12}^2\\big|$ ] , which means that the output states at frequencies @xmath95 are symmetric , independent of the ratio @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , unlike the intracavity situation , one - way spectral steering can impossibly be achieved when @xmath96 , even for the unbalanced cavity losses .",
    "the symmetric steering spectra are plotted in fig.[case3 ] ( a ) .",
    "it shows that strong two - way steering can be obtained around the frequencies @xmath97 at which the cavity fields are strongly excited .",
    "nevertheless , for weak mechanical damping the one - way steering from the output field 2 to the field 1 at cavity resonances is obtainable via thermalizing the mechanical oscillator , as shown in fig[case3 ] ( b ) , since the steering in this direction is more robust against thermal noise than the reverse steering , as similarly in figs.[case1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "this one - way steering at cavity resonances ( @xmath98<1 $ ] and @xmath99>1 $ ] ) requires @xmath100 hence , the one - way steering from the output field 2 to 1 can still be achieved even for the large number of thermal phonons when @xmath101 .",
    "it shows again that this directional one - way steering is much more robust to thermal noise than the reverse one , as exhibited in fig.([case1 ] ) .    by increasing the mechanical damping rate which enters the strong damping regime",
    ", we plot the steering in fig.[case4 ] .",
    "interestingly , we see that the one - way steering from the output field 1 to the field 2 can be achievable over all frequencies . at zero temperature the condition @xmath99<1 $ ] always holds while @xmath98>1 $ ] requires the mechanical damping rate @xmath102 for which the one - way steering in this direction is achievable .",
    "in summary , we propose a scheme for realizing one - way steering of two electromagnetic fields by double cavity optomechanics .",
    "the two cavity fields are mediated by a mechanical oscillator and driven respectively by a red and a blue detuned strong coherent fields .",
    "we show that asymmetric steering can be achieved for unequal cavity losses or strong mechanical damping in the regime of steady states .",
    "the conditions for achieving one - way steering of the intracavity and output fields are found .",
    "the asymmetric steering may be useful in quantum communication and information . besides optoelectromechanical interfaces ,",
