    "in the last years there has been a vast theoretical effort to understand the properties of liquid crystals in bulk phases . however , it is only recently that the interfacial phenomena presented by these complex fluids have attracted an increasing interest .",
    "the ability to manipulate the direction of the preferred molecular alignment , the _ director _ , by coupling to surfaces , is a property with a great practical interest .",
    "for this reason , there is a new effort trying to describe this rich _ surface phenomenology _ in the liquid crystals .",
    "these studies have mainly used phenomenological landau - de gennes approaches and aimed to describe , with more or less success , different phenomena such as subsurface deformations @xcite ( ordering close to a surface ) , changes in the alingnment of the director due to the interaction with a solid substrate @xcite , nematic - isotropic transition @xcite , wetting @xcite , etc . on the other hand ,",
    "microscopic - type theories claim to provide a more precise description of theses inhomogeneous problems since they take account of the structure at the molecular scale . in this framework",
    ", there is a recent literature describing attemps to answer such questions and it is supposed to provide more satisfactory theories in the interfacial phenomena .",
    "for example , by employing an onsager - type theory r. van roij _",
    "@xcite investigated the problem of biaxiality and wetting for the zwanzig model .",
    "p. i. c teixeira has discussed , in a recent work @xcite , the existence of subsurface deformations for the case of a confined nematic phase by using a generalized van der waals theory . in previous papers , also employing this last approach , we studied surface phenomena in the case of a nematic in contact with a single wall @xcite as well as capillary effects in the case of a nematic in slab geometry with symmetric walls @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite our attention was restricted to the study of a nematic in the presence of a solid interface .",
    "model parameters where chosen such that the surface forced the molecules to lie perpendicular to the interface ( homeotropic orientation ) while in the nematic - isotropic interface the nematic director had a preference to lie parallel to the interface ( planar orientation ) . in the model , surface parameters responsible for the order are the particle - wall interaction ( @xmath0 ) and the particle - particle interaction ( @xmath1 ) which played an important role in the interplay between anchoring and wetting transitions .",
    "a first - order anchoring transition between planar and homeotropic regimes was found ; in a @xmath2 ( chemical potential - temperature ) representation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) this transition appears as a line called anchoring line .",
    "this line approaches the nematic - isotropic transition line tangentially ( at constant @xmath3 , eventually cuts this line at @xmath4 ) , due to the existence of total wetting state at the coexistence .",
    "later , the nematic phase was confined by symmetric walls , i.e both walls favored the same orientation ( homeotropic ) @xcite .",
    "then , also the same anchoring line appeared and it was found to be very insensitive to the pore width except with respect to the localization of @xmath4 that is shifted by capillary effects .",
    "these findings have a bearing on the new phenomenology which appears when the liquid crystal is confined .    in the present paper ,",
    "the theory is generalized to the case where the walls compete in molecular alignment .",
    "we believe that deeper insight into the surface - induced effects in liquid crystals can be obtained from a molecular approach and , in this respect , density funtional theory appears to be a powerful tool .",
    "the confinement of the nematic phase is imposed by the presence of a boundary made up of two opposing flat surfaces , one favoring homeotropic orientation and the other favoring planar orientation . in these conditions , a spatial variation in the tilt angle between the director and the surface normal",
    "the textures adopted by the nematic director depend very dramatically on the values of both surface field and pore width .",
    "for the case of a strong surface field @xmath0 and a wide pore this dependence is linear with respect to the coordinate normal to the interfaces except close to the surfaces .",
    "this configuration satisfies surface boundary conditions but entails an elastic energy which is minimum for a linear tilt configuration . for weaker surface fields and/or narrow pores",
    "a different texture occurs where the tilt angle adopts a steplike configuration .",
    "our calculations also reveal the existence of biaxial behavior close to the surface favoring planar orientation as well as in a small region associated to the change of orientation in the steplike configuration .",
    "these biaxilities are direct surface effects due to the existence of different interfaces .    in the next section",
    "we give a short account of the theoretical model used to describe the structure and thermodynamics of the confined liquid crystal . in section [ results ]",
    "we show the different tilt configurations that result and argue that the phase transition between the linear - tilt and the steplike - tilt configurations can be related with the anchoring transition found in the semi - infinite problem .",
    "we also discuss how biaxiality is affected by the pore width .",
    "we end up with a section of conclusions .",
    "the theoretical model is a standard generalized van der waals theory based on a perturbative expansion , using a hard - sphere ( hs ) fluid as reference system @xcite .",

    "the walls are modeled via the following potentials : @xmath31 which favors homeotropic anchoring , and @xmath32 which favors planar alignment .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is the surface strength of the walls and plays an important role in anchoring phenomena .    in order to describe the orientational structure of the fluid a tensorial order parameter is defined as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the kronecker symbol and",

    "the molecules align preferently along the director , defined as the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue ( the uniaxial order parameter @xmath42 ) . in the second case ,",
    "the molecular orientations are uniformly distributed on a plane perpendicular to the eigenvector correponding to the lowest eigenvalue .    for the case of non - degenerated eigenvalues",
    ", we can define the uniaxial ( @xmath43 ) and biaxial ( @xmath44 ) order parameters in terms of the eigenvalues of this tensor .",
    "the former is defined , as before , as the largest eigenvalue of the order parameter tensor ( @xmath45 ) and the corresponding eigenvector is the local director of the fluid .",
    "the biaxial parameter is proportional to the difference of the two smallest eigenvalues .",
    "this quantity gives information of the amount of the orientational order on the plane perpendicular to the director . in this way",
    ", a secondary director can be defined as the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath46 . by the symmetry of the problem , we have focused in the case where the director varies in the @xmath47 plane and is invariant with respect to a reflexion @xmath48 . in these conditions ,",

    "the model predicts a bulk phase diagram with vapor , isotropic liquid and nematic liquid coexisting at a triple point temperature @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "confinement of simple liquids generally brings about capillary effects and associated capillary condensation phenomena whereby condensation occurs below the saturation point in bulk , as measured for example by the chemical potential .",
    "similar phenomena must occur in nematic liquid crystals but with additional complicating factors due to the orientational order induced by the confining surfaces .    in the following we use the chemical potential @xmath3 as the external thermodynamic potential , in addition to the temperature @xmath66 .",
    "capillary condensation of the nematic from the isotropic phase occurs when , at fixed @xmath3 , the temperature @xmath67 at which the pore becomes filled with an oriented ( nematic ) phase is shifted with respect to the corresponding temperature in bulk @xmath68 .",
    "we are thus seeking a non - zero value of @xmath69 .",
    "our calculations reveal that , contrary to the case of symmetric walls @xcite and , for large pore widths ( @xmath15 larger than @xmath70 ) , no significant capillary effect exists , i.e. we find that the ni transition occurs at the same temperatures as in the bulk state",
    ". however , there are indications that for smaller pore widths this situation is not true longer ( this aspect is being studied currently ) .",
    "note though that condensation lines involving confined vapor states are expected to be affected by confinement ; since these lines are not central to our argument we do not give any results in the following .",
    "1 shows the bulk phase diagram , with vapor ( v ) , isotropic ( i ) and nematic ( n ) phases and their corresponding phase transitions .",
    "we have superimposed the anchoring line , representing surface phase transitions between states with different director alignment for the semi - infinite problem ( i.e. only one surface , inducing homeotropic alignment ) ; these results have been obtained with a surface field @xmath71 , for larger values this transition curve tends to approach the coexistence lines reducing then the region of planar states @xcite .",
    "now , we have calculated equilibrium states but with the sample confined between two opposing walls separated a distance @xmath15 .",
    "there is a molecular ordering field due to the surfaces through the potential parameter @xmath0 .",
    "if the surface field strength is sufficiently high , one expects the director to adopt the configuration which satisfies the orientation favored by each surface , at least approximately .",
    "however , this necessarily demands that the director becomes distorted within the pore which entails a free energy cost due to the elastic contribution .",
    "in fact , the distribution of this inhomogeneity along the pore is found to depend sensitively on the values of pore width and surface field strength , and is expected to also depend on the thermodynamic parameters @xmath3 and @xmath66 .",
    "competition between these two energies results in the existence of two tilt configurations : l , where the tilt angle rotates uniformly along the pore and the resulting tilt - angle profile is linear in @xmath50 ; s , where the tilt angle adopts a step - like configuration , being constant throughout the sample except in a narrow region close to the @xmath13 surface where a crossover exists from @xmath72 ( homeotropic ) to @xmath73 ( planar ) .    fig .",
    "2 shows an l phase for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and for thermodynamic conditions of temperature and chemical potential where , in the semi - infinite case , the nematic is clearly in the homeotropic state ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) . in the middle of the pore",
    "the tilt profile is almost a linear function of @xmath50 , approaching smoothly the walls to their favored values .    in the fig .",
    "3 the density , the uniaxial and biaxial order parameter profiles are plotted . the profiles present a smooth behavior , reaching a clear plateau in the middle of the pore with values close to the bulk values .",
    "the vanishing value of @xmath44 in regions far from the interfaces is consistent with the uniaxial nature of the fluid particles .",
    "close to walls the profile behaves differently depending on the favored orientation . around the @xmath13 surface the @xmath43 order parameter increases due to the strong surface interaction ( despite of a decay in density ) .",
    "however , these deformations do not induce biaxiality ( i.e. @xmath78 ) due to the smooth character of the tilt profile along the pore . on the other hand , near the @xmath14 surface",
    ", where the tilt angle is @xmath73 , the @xmath43 order parameter gets lower values and @xmath79 , that reflects the orientation of the molecules are mainly distributed on the @xmath80 plane , being the @xmath81 axis the in - plane preferred direction .",
    "the decrease of the amount of order is due to surface potential that promotes a random planar distribution .    if the surface field strength is reduced the director tilt configuration changes over to a step , i.e. a s phase .",
    "here the tilt angle is uniform and equal to @xmath73 except in a narrow homeotropic region close to the homeotropic wall ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in general",
    ", this homeotropic region increases with the wall - particle potential range and with the strength of the surface field , so for the case of @xmath82 one recover the configuration which corresponds to a nematic - hard walls interfaces ( planar throughout the pore ) .",
    "note that the s phase is spatially asymmetric , the tilt orientation being different from planar only in a small region close to the homeotropic wall .",
    "in fact , a corresponding s phase where the tilt were in a homeotropic configuration except in a very small region close to the planar wall is not observed in our calculations because of the effect due to the ordering field coming through the potential parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this field promotes molecular configurations where the director lies along a direction either perpendicular or parallel to the direction of inhomogeneity , depending on the sign of @xmath1 ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 , respectively ) . in our case @xmath83 , which means that the preferred director orientation is planar except in the region , close to @xmath13 , where the effect of the wall promoting homeotropic alignment is more pronounced .    in the figure 5",
    "we plot the density , uniaxial and biaxial order parameters profiles in the s phase obtained with @xmath85 .",
    "again the profiles only deviate from the bulk values close to the surfaces .",
    "the deviations around @xmath14 has the same origin that in the l phase .",
    "however , close to @xmath13 this behavior has different nature .",
    "an analysis of the order parameteres profiles reveals that the system goes _ smoothly _ from an homeotropic to a planar configuration via a random planar state in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "this point ( @xmath86 at fig .",
    "5 ) corresponds to the jump of the tilt ( origin of the step function profile ) .",
    "this mechanism is reponsible of the decay of the order and the biaxial behavior around this region .",
    "in fact , the existence of a crossover between homeotropic configuration and a planar configuration is closely linked to the capability of the fluid to have biaxial behavior in a small spatial range between both anchoring states .",
    "so , the roles that the @xmath50 and @xmath81 axes play as the local director and secondary director , respectively , for @xmath87 are exchanged at @xmath88 . however , in order to make this mechanism feasible a dramatic depletion on the amount of order is needed .",
    "moreover , the secondary director changes its alignment from the @xmath50 axis to the @xmath54 axis as @xmath50 is increased ( i.e. @xmath44 changes its sign ) , before that biaxiality virtually disappears in the middle of the pore .",
    "biaxiality directly induced by the breaking of symmetry associated with the presence of the interfaces and , in the case of a free interface with planar director alignment , has been observed in simulations @xcite .    in order to study in more detail the dependence of the nematic ordering on the pore width , we have calculated uniaxial order and biaxiality profiles for different values of @xmath15 and for @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "6 ) . for pore widths",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 , for which the l phase is the stable phase , the profiles exhibit inhomogeneity regions close to the surface favoring planar alignment , being almost constant in the rest of the pore .",
    "note that biaxiality occurs only where the tilt angle is significantly close to @xmath73 .",
    "an interesting feature is that the order parameter profiles converge around to @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) to the profiles obtained for the @xmath13 surface against a nematic in a homeotropic configuration ( resp .",
    "the @xmath14 surface against a nematic in a planar configuration ) .",
    "furthermore , such semi - infinite profiles are the equilibrium ones for these values of @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath66 . on the other hand , for @xmath91 ,",
    "the stable phase is the s phase , and additional regions of inhomogeneity ( and biaxiality ) develop in the neighbourhood of the @xmath13 surface .",
    "the transition between the l and s phases involves a finite free - energy barrier , implying the existence of a thermodynamic first - order phase transition between the two phases .",
    "this is revealed by computing the relevant free energy for confined systems , i.e. the grand potential , as a function of the potential parameters and/or the thermodynamic parameters @xmath3 and @xmath66 . in our case",
    "we have chosen to fix the latter and vary @xmath0 .",
    "7 shows the behavior of the grand potential as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "two branches , corresponding to the l and s phases , are shown .",
    "the point where the branches cross , @xmath92 , gives the transition point .",
    "note the existence of metastable branches in both phases , which indicates the first - order nature of the phase transition .",
    "tilt angle profiles along the pore corresponding to the coexisting l and s phases at @xmath93 for @xmath74 are shown in fig .",
    "note that the linear behavior in the l phase has an smaller range and its slope is also less than in the case presented in fig .",
    "on the other hand , the step in the s phase is located further from the @xmath13 surface than in the case presented in fig .",
    "4 .    as in any analysis of metastable states , some caution has to be exercised in analysing the occurrence of the different phases . in particular ,",
    "the initial conditions required in our numerical minimisation scheme have to be chosen carefully .",
    "for example , the reality of the metastable l branch is shown by performing the following analysis : i ) equilibrium s states at low @xmath0 are obtained by conducting minimisation processes starting from linear and step - like profiles ; these processes give the same equilibrium s states .",
    "ii ) for higher , increasing values of @xmath0 , using step - like profiles or linear profiles as starting conditions give different final states beyond the transition point @xmath92 , the final l states having lower grand potential energies than the final s states .",
    "this is the region of metastability of the s phase .",
    "proceeding in the same way but from the l branch at high @xmath0 and decreasing @xmath0 provides the metastability region for the l phase .    fig .",
    "9 shows the global phase diagram with respect to the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath15 and for thermodynamic conditions @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "the line indicates the phase transition separating l and s phases . as the pore width",
    "is increased , the region of stability of the l phase is enlarged since the elastic energy associated with the deformation of the director along the pore ( proportional to the integrated squared gradient of the tilt profile ) decreases as opposed to the case of the s phase , for which this energy is essentially constant and seems to approach asymptotically to the value of @xmath94 , at which the anchoring transition occurs for the semi - infinite case of the nematic against the @xmath13 wall . for narrow pores ,",
    "we find a quick increase of @xmath92 as the pore width is reduced , indicating that , in order for the l phase to become stable , a large surface field is required to compensate for the large elastic energy associated with a high tilt angle gradient .",
    "an interesting issue , which we have been unable to address due to technical reasons , is whether this first order phase transition may end up at a critical point as the pore width is reduced or even become second order through the appearance of a tricritical point .",
    "an analysis of the results quoted above shows that there is a relationship between the l - s transition and the anchoring transition observed in the semi - infinite problem .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath95 .",
    "we have observed that the density and order parameter profiles deviate from the bulk values only in regions around of the surfaces , being the ranges of the inhomogeinities of the order of the molecular interactions .",
    "this feature is not surprising for the s phase , since in the middle of the pore the nematic is in a non - distorted tilt configuration ( i.e. planar ) , so its tilt profile can be understood as two uncorrelated semi - infinite profiles linked via the bulk planar state .",
    "however , this fact is also true for the l phase even when the tilt distorsion is propagated through the pore ( see discussion for the fig . 6 above ) .",
    "this is the scenario that the phenomenological theory implicitly assumes : the excess free energy @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the bulk pressure and @xmath98 is the volumen of the sample ) can be split in two terms , an elastic term @xmath99 that comes from the distortions of the director field in a macroscopic scale , and surface terms , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , that include the effect of the density and order parameter inhomogeneities in a microscopic scale close to the boundaries .",
    "the elastic term is given in terms of the elastic constants @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 by the oseen - frank free energy @xcite as : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the director field .",
    "note that the splay - bend term is not included since @xmath108 in bulk @xcite .",
    "if we restrict our study to the cases in which there is translational symmetry in the @xmath80 plane and the director is assumed to be in the @xmath47 plane ( there is no twist ) , then @xmath109 . in our model of uniaxial molecules with top - bottom symmetry , @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the bulk density and uniaxial order parameter , respectively @xcite .",
    "so , the total excess free energy is given by : @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "note that the dependence of the surface terms on the contact values at the boundaries of the tilt angle and its derivative respect to @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "functional minimization of ( [ phenomenologic ] ) leads to an equilibrium tilt linear profile @xmath115 .",
    "the exact expression for the profile will depend on the surface terms of the free energy , so it is needed some information about them .",
    "the values of @xmath100 can be obtained microscopically from the excess free energy corresponding to a case of the wall against a distorted nematic whose tilt profile goes asymptotically as @xmath116 for @xmath117 ( this discussion is analogous for the @xmath14 case ) .",
    "since @xmath118 the effect of the distortion far from the @xmath13 surface will be a perturbation respect to the case @xmath119 , that corresponds to the semi - infinite case studied in @xcite . in this reference",
    "it was shown that if the wall promotes homeotropic anchoring , depending on the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath1 two local minima can appear for @xmath120 and @xmath121 with a free energy barrier between them . however ,",
    "if the surface favors a planar anchoring only a global minimum at @xmath121 can exist .",
    "we can expand now the surface free energy in a series of both @xmath49 and @xmath122 around @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the special symmetry of our problem ( rotational invariance around the @xmath50 axis and the top - bottom symmetry of the molecules ) implies that the linear term in @xmath122 vanishes . from this analysis",
    "we can conclude that for @xmath95 two different states can exist : a linear state that goes from a tilt close to @xmath72 at @xmath13 to a value close to @xmath73 at @xmath14 , and a state with non - distorted planar tilt through the pore , and that correspond to the l and s states we have found , respectively .",
    "furthermore , by using this phenomenologic approach a first - order transition can be predicted close to the anchoring line , inside the homeotropic region . the equation ( [ phenomenologic ] ) , up to terms of the order of @xmath125 , is : @xmath126 where @xmath127 or @xmath128 for the l and s states , respectively .",
    "the transition occurs for @xmath129 which implies that @xmath130 , i.e. the conditions should correspond to have an homeotropic configuration in the semi - infinite case , and the transition is first - order due to the free - energy barrier that exists between the two minima for the semi - infinite case .",
    "so , for @xmath131 an stable l configuration exists and for @xmath132 the s state is the stable one . from the eq .",
    "( [ ht ] ) it is clear that @xmath133 as the system approaches to the anchoring line ( characterized by the condition @xmath134 ) , i.e. the l - s transition occurs for infinitely wide pores and , consequently , the anchoring line can be understood as the limit of the l - s transition for @xmath135 .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the scenario presented above is only true for @xmath136 .",
    "however , our calculations reveal that the l - s transition observed by our density functional theory ( dft ) calculations is the continuation of the transition predicted for wide pores .",
    "first of all , the free energy of the s phase is expected to converge towards its limiting value given by equation ( [ approx ] ) very fast , as it was observed in the symmetric walls case in @xcite . for the l phase ,",
    "we have compared the dft results for @xmath75 with the limiting expression given by the eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) ( see fig .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath66 are the same as in all our calculations , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for such conditions , @xmath137 . on the other hand , calculations for the semi - infinite case show that the asymptotic value for @xmath135 is given by @xmath138 .",
    "it is clear that the values of @xmath139 converge for relatively small values of @xmath15 to the expression given by the phenomenologic theory , and in any case the behavior is qualitatively correct .",
    "> from this analysis we conclude that the l - s transition is driven by the anchoring ( surface ) transition that occurs for the semi - infinite case of the nematic against the @xmath13 surface .",
    "in this paper we have employed a well - tested generalised van der waals theory to investigate the effect of confinement on the thermodynamics and the microscopic structure of a nematic liquid crystal .",
    "the presence of two confining surfaces favoring opposite orientations of the nematic director makes the order parameter , which is a tensorial quantity , exhibit all of its richness , giving rise to capillary effects not present in simple , non - orientable fluids .",
    "the competing conditions at the surfaces imply a deformed state of the director inside the pore .",
    "the main result of our study is that the system may adopt two possible states : one where the director changes orientation at an interface located close to the surface that favors homeotropic anchoring ( depending on the wall - particle potential range ) , and one where the deformation takes place uniformly , giving rise to a basically linear tilt profile , with some degree of deformation close to the surfaces .",
    "the director may change from one configuration to another via a first - order phase transition .",
    "the interplay between these two phases may be understood in terms of the competition between the elastic energy associated with a deformed director state and the energy associated with the orienting surfaces .",
    "we have also shown that this transition is closely linked with the planar - homeotropic transition observed in the semi - infinite problem . in order to prove this aspect ,",
    "a phenomenologic treatment has been employed .",
    "on the one hand , the theory shows how for big pores ( @xmath95 ) the l - s first order transition can occur at threshold value of the pore width @xmath140 . on the other hand",
    ", the phenomenological approach also reveals that for @xmath141 the l - s transition corresponds to the anchoring transition of the semi - infinite problem .",
    "we also conclude that the transition obtained by the dft is the continuation to shorter scales of the transition predicted by the phenomenological theory , that in principle is only valid for much larger pore widths .",

    "<S> the director is distorted uniformly , the tilt angle exhibiting a linear dependence with the distance normal to the surface ( l phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations reveal the existence of a first - order transition between the two director configurations , which is driven by changes in the surface field strength , and also by changes in the pore width . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the transition occurs , for a given surface field , between the s phase for narrow pores and the l phase for wider pores . </S>",
