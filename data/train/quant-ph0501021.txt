    "unfortunately the comparison of two objects , such as two operating systems , may be expensive when the entire message strings that identify these objects must be transmitted over large distances .",
    "fingerprinting allows a significant reduction in communication costs when a small likelihood of error in the comparison is acceptable .",
    "then , rather than transmitting the entire message string for the object itself , a relatively shorter string , or fingerprint , that identifies the object is sent .",
    "although errors may arise in the comparison of fingerprints , this error can be made sufficiently small by simply increasing the fingerprint length .",
    "the key question concerned with fingerprinting is , for given message and fingerprint lengths , what is the minimum achievable guaranteed error rate ? in this article we partially answer this question for fingerprinting protocols described within yao s simultaneous message passing model of communication complexity  @xcite .",
    "the fingerprints are then generated and transmitted by two parties , alice and bob , who are forbidden direct communication , but instead allowed to correspond with a referee known as roger .",
    "our fingerprinting scenario is described as follows ( see fig [ fig ] ) .",
    "a supplier , who we call sapna , chooses two messages , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , from a pool of @xmath2 unique messages and hands them to alice and bob , respectively . as communication",
    "is considered expensive , alice and bob are limited to sending fingerprints of their original messages to roger , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , which they select from a smaller pool of size @xmath5 .",

    "we consider one - sided - error protocols , in which case , @xmath9 only if @xmath10 .",
    "one - sided - error protocols are of vital practical importance whenever the ` cost ' of false negative results exceeds that of false positives .    the fingerprinting protocol adopted by alice , bob and roger",
    "is publicly announced .",
    "the goal of this protocol is to minimize roger s error probability .",
    "sapna , however , may be a saboteur , and always choose message pairs that lead to the highest rate of error in roger s output .",
    "we thus evaluate fingerprinting protocols according to this worst - case scenario .",
    "the worst - case error probability , @xmath11 , then corresponds to the maximum error rate of the protocol .    in the private - coin model ,",
    "each party is handed a coin to generate private randomness .",
    "this gives alice and bob the ability to probabilistically avoid message collisions , in which different messages produce the same fingerprint . in the following",
    "we analyze the public - coin model , for which an additional source of randomness is made available , in the form of a secret key generated by a public coin , to be shared by alice and bob , but kept hidden from sapna .",
    "one way to hide the key from sapna is for alice and bob to use only those public - coin outcomes that have arisen after sapna has dealt the messages .",
    "there has been recent interest in quantum analogues of fingerprinting protocols @xcite .",
    "whereas classical fingerprints are length @xmath12 bit strings , quantum fingerprints are states in an @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space , or equivalently , @xmath12 qubit strings .",
    "furthermore , in the quantum regime , shared randomness is replaced by shared entangled states .",
    "the seemingly more general case of alice and bob sharing both entanglement and randomness is not necessary : alice and bob may always generate shared randomness from shared entanglement through local measurements .    it has been shown in the asymptotic limit that , when shared randomness ( or entanglement ) is forbidden , fingerprints composed of quantum information can be made exponentially smaller than those composed of classical information .",
    "specifically , for messages of length @xmath13 bits , in the classical case it is sufficient and necessary for alice and bob to communicate fingerprints of length @xmath14 bits if the error is to be kept arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "if however , the parties communicate fingerprints constructed from quantum bits , only @xmath15 many are needed @xcite .",
    "this definitive resource advantage does not exist when a shared key is allowed , in which case , fingerprints of length @xmath16 bits / qubits are now sufficient @xcite . here",
    "we derive an analytic bound , however , that quantum fingerprinting protocols must surpass in order to claim any advantage over classical protocols .",
    "such bounds are important for experimental tests of quantum fingerprinting @xcite .",
    "we show that , for classical fingerprinting protocols with one - sided error and an arbitrary amount of shared randomness , the _ minimum achievable _ worst - case error probability is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) when @xmath19 , and @xmath20 otherwise . quantum fingerprinting protocols with an arbitrary amount of shared entanglement , on the other hand",
    ", are shown to attain worst - case error probabilities of @xmath21 when @xmath22 , and @xmath20 otherwise .",
    "the difference between the two error rates is made clear when @xmath5 divides @xmath2 , in which case the classical error probability reduces to @xmath23 .",
    "it is interesting that the addition of shared entanglement in the quantum case allows perfect error - free fingerprinting protocols to be constructed when @xmath24 . in the limit of large message numbers , @xmath25 ,",
    "the classical error probability  ( [ eq : pclassical_wce ] ) tends to @xmath26 whereas the quantum error probability  ( [ eq : pquantum_wce ] ) approaches @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic limit , some improvement of quantum fingerprinting protocols over classical protocols still exists in the presence of shared randomness or entanglement .",
    "we now begin our analysis by considering classical fingerprinting protocols .    .",
    "we first present a simple protocol which achieves the bound [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : pclassical_wce ] ) ] . in each round of fingerprinting , alice and",
    "bob use their shared random key to partition the set of @xmath2 messages into @xmath5 groups of almost equal size : @xmath28 groups containing @xmath29 messages , and @xmath30 groups containing @xmath31 messages ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this partition is identical for alice and bob , but given the randomness of the key , is completely unknown to sapna . upon receipt of the messages , alice and",
    "bob generate fingerprints according to which group they belong to .",
    "roger then infers equality if and only if the fingerprints he receives are identical i.e. the messages belong to the same group .    in this protocol , the worst - case scenario occurs when sapna chooses unequal message pairs belonging to the same group .",
    "sapna has @xmath32 choices from a total of @xmath33 unequal message pairs , but not being privy to how the messages are grouped , she is instead compelled to send random pairs of unequal messages .",
    "the worst - case error rate is thus given by the ratio of these two numbers [ eq .  ( [ eq : pclassical_wce ] ) ] .",
    "note that the protocol is implemented without any need for private randomness .",
    "the remainder of this section is dedicated to proving that it is indeed optimal .",
