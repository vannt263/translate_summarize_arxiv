    "different types of `` density gradient '' edge magnetoplasmons ( emps ) have been studied for ( conventional ) 2des subjected to a strong homogeneous magnetic field ; for a discussion of previous publications , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "these emps appear due to a strong change of the stationary local electron density at the edge of the channel ( in particular , in the vicinity of edge states ) that induces a strong modulation of the local magnetoconductivity tensor ; modulation of the nondiagonal components is especially important @xcite .",

    ", we assume that hpmg is given by the half - plane metallic nonmagnetic film of negligible thickness , ( @xmath18 , @xmath14 ) , and that 2des is embedded in gaas based sample .",
    "notice , for a real experimental setup a finite thickness of hpmg can be treated as negligible if it is much smaller than @xmath0 , and @xmath22 .",
    "besides hpmg and the plane of 2des the rest of space we assume as a dielectric background with spatially homogeneous ( and real ) dielectric constant @xmath19 ; i.e. , the ferromagnetic semi - infinite film is a dielectric one with dielectric constant @xmath205 .",
    "point out , such ferromagnetic materials as ferrite or ceramic magnets can show both dielectric and ferromagnetic properties similar to ones assumed in present study .    in addition , the properties of memps for the present model , at @xmath206 ( especially for @xmath207 ) , should be similar to the properties of memps of more easily experimentally realised setup with the ferromagnetic semi - infinite film , as in fig .",
    "1 , that is also _ metallic _ and placed on a top of gaas sample ( with the rest of a space filled in , e.g. , with the dielectric medium with the same dielectric constant as gaas , except the @xmath13 plane of 2des ) . in this case",
    "the ferromagnetic semi - infinite film can be made , e.g. , from dysprosium ( dy ) or permalloy that at liquid helium temperature @xmath208k will show necessary ferromagnetic properties and , due to their metallic behaviour , well approximate the effect of hpmg .",
    "the decrease of @xmath161 between @xmath73 to @xmath209 will mainly lead , e.g. , to a decrease of @xmath210 ; so that for @xmath211 ( other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "2 ) it follows @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "this decrease of @xmath161 has minor effect on the spatial structure of memps or a form of lateral inhomogeneity of the magnetic field at the 2des plane ; however , it essentially decreases the characteristic amplitude of the latter modulation ; the latter decrease becomes @xmath214 . for @xmath215 .",
    "point out for 2des with the density @xmath216 in gaas based heterostructure at @xmath208k usually the mobility @xmath217 .",
    "then the condition of the strong magnetic field @xmath218 gives @xmath219 t ; in addition , from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , for @xmath220 , it follows that this condition reduces to @xmath221 t .",
    "present memps are slow , @xmath222 , potential waves ; as @xmath223 is a characteristic phase velocity of the memps , this condition obtains the form @xmath224 .",
