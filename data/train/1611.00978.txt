    "the helical and azimuthal magnetorotational instabilities are dissipation - induced instabilities that attracted growing theoretical and experimental interest in recent years .",
    "they operate in magnetized shear flows with high resistivity , or very low magnetic prandtl numbers , @xmath0 , i.e. , the ratio of viscosity @xmath1 to magnetic diffusivity @xmath2 . the helical magnetorotational instability ( hmri ) was first discovered theoretically by hollerbach & rdiger @xcite , who realized that adding an azimuthal field @xmath3 to a vertical @xmath4 can render a differentially rotating magnetized flow unstable even at very high resistivity up to the limit @xmath5 , in contrast to standard magnetorotational instability ( smri ) with vertical magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this property makes these instabilities amenable to experimental study in taylor - couette ( tc ) setup filled with low @xmath6 liquid metals . as a result ,",
    "the first experimental detection of hmri had followed shortly after its theoretical discovery @xcite .",
    "hmri was subsequently studied by means of linear modal stability analysis both with global tc ( e.g. , @xcite ) and local ( short - wavelength ) approaches ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) as well as via experiments @xcite .",
    "it was shown that hmri is determined by the reynolds number ( @xmath7 ) and the hartmann number ( @xmath8 ) , that ensures its persistence at high resistivity , where smri does not normally exist . using the local analysis , liu et al .",
    "@xcite showed that in the presence of an imposed current - free azimuthal magnetic field hmri operates for rotation profiles @xmath9 with negative or positive shear steeper than certain critical values .",
    "specifically , this condition , expressed by the rossby number @xmath10 , reads as @xmath11 or @xmath12 , where lll and ull refer to the lower and upper liu limits , respectively .",
    "the azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri ) is a non - axisymmetric relative of the axisymmetric hmri that operates for dominant azimuthal field @xcite and shares many properties with the latter .",
    "in particular , the same liu limits define the threshold of stability for amri too @xcite .",
    "the existence and importance of amri for steep positive shear was also shown recently @xcite .",
    "apart from liquid metal flows in laboratory , low-@xmath13 flows are found in a wide variety of astrophysical and geophysical settings : in the `` dead zones '' of protoplanetary disks , in stellar interiors and in the liquid cores of planets , which thus are the potential sites for hmri and amri activity .",
    "moreover , in compact objects , like stars and planets , the condition of decreasing angular velocity ( requirement for smri ) is not everywhere met , for example , in the equator - near strip of the solar tachocline @xcite , which is also the region of sunspot activity @xcite .",
    "the liu limits imply that in the case of current - free field , hmri and amri do not extend to the astrophysically important keplerian rotation with @xmath14 .",
    "to remedy the situation , kirillov & stefani @xcite considered axial electrical currents not only at the axis , but also in the fluid , resulting in the azimuthal field @xmath15 to deviate from the current - free profile @xmath16 .",
    "they generalized the dispersion relation of liu et al .",
    "@xcite for this case and derived a new instability boundary  a curve in a plane that is spanned by @xmath17 and a corresponding steepness of @xmath3 , called magnetic rossby number , @xmath18 . in the limit of large @xmath7 and @xmath19 , this curve acquires the closed form @xmath20 it is seen from this expression that the lll and the ull are just the endpoints of this curve in the current - free regime @xmath21 .",
    "condition ( 1 ) indicates that even a small axial current within the liquid can break the lower liu limit @xmath22 and enable hmri and amri to operate for keplerian profiles .",
    "this effect is now to be investigated in a planned liquid sodium tc experiment @xcite , which will combine and enhance the previous experiments on hmri @xcite , amri @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned linear studies of hmri and amri were carried out in the framework of classical modal stability analysis of fluid mechanics , which focuses on the behavior at asymptotically large times . instead , the nonmodal approach to the stability of shear flows focuses on the finite - time dynamics of perturbations , accounting for transient phenomena due to the shear - induced nonnormality of the flow @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one calculates the optimal initial perturbations that lead to the maximum possible linear amplification during some finite time . in self - adjoint flows , the perturbations that grow most are least stable solutions of the modal eigenvalue problem .",
    "by contrast , in non - selfadjoint shear flows , the normal mode eigenfunctions are non - orthogonal due to the nonnormality , resulting in transient , or nonmodal amplification of perturbations , often by factors much higher than that of the most unstable normal mode @xcite .",
    "so , leaving out the effects of the nonnormality can give an incomplete picture of the overall dynamics ( stability ) of shear flows .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the nonmodal dynamics of hmri and amri in differentially rotating magnetized flows , which represent a special class of shear flows and hence the nonnormality inevitably plays a role for them . up to date",
    ", these instabilities have been studied using the modal approach .",
    "recently , the nonmodal dynamics of smri was addressed by squire & bhattacharjee @xcite and mamatsashvili et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we extend these investigations to the resistive , or low-@xmath13 regime , where only hmri and amri survive .",
    "one of our main goals is to link the magnetohydrodynamic features of these instabilities including the universal two liu limits derived with modal approach , which still remain unexplained , to the nonmodal dynamics of perturbations in the hydrodynamic case .",
    "the main equations of non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics for incompressible conducting media are @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the density , @xmath27 the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath28 the magnetic diffusivity , @xmath29 is the thermal pressure , @xmath30 is the velocity and @xmath31 is the magnetic field .",
    "an equilibrium flow represents a fluid rotating with angular velocity @xmath9 and threaded by a magnetic field , which comprises a constant axial component @xmath32 and an azimuthal one @xmath33 with arbitrary radial dependence : @xmath34    consider now small perturbations about this equilibrium , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . following @xcite we",

    "the reynolds number , @xmath60 , and the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath61 , are fixed to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , yielding a small magnetic prandtl number @xmath64 typical for liquid metals .",
    "the strength of the imposed field is measured by the hartmann number @xmath65 , which is in the range @xmath66 in liquid metal experiments @xcite .",
    "the relative effect of the azimuthal magnetic field over the axial one is characterized by the ratio @xmath67 .",

    "we consider rayleigh - stable rotation with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , since the axial current decreases with radius .",
    "it is readily shown that @xmath52 is indeed nonnormal , i.e. , it does not commute with its adjoint , @xmath73 .",
    "we quantify the nonmodal amplification in terms of the total perturbation energy , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , which is a physically relevant norm .",
    "the maximum possible , or optimal growth at a specific time @xmath76 is defined as the ratio @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the energy at @xmath76 and the maximization is done over all initial states @xmath79 with a given initial energy @xmath80 ( e.g. , ref .",
    "the final state at @xmath76 is found from the initial state at @xmath81 by solving the linear eq .",
    "( 5 ) and can be formally written as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the propagator matrix .",
    "then , the maximum possible amplification @xmath84 is usually calculated by the singular value decomposition of @xmath85 at @xmath76 ( e.g. , refs .",
    "the square of the largest singular value gives the value of @xmath84 and the corresponding initial condition that leads to this growth , optimal perturbation , is given by the right singular vector .",
    "note again that the nonmodal approach combined with the method of optimal perturbations is the most general way of analyzing shear flow dynamics ( stability ) at all times , as opposed to the modal approach , which is concerned only with the behavior at asymptotic times and hence omits important finite - time phenomena .",
    "before embarking on investigating the nonmodal dynamics of hmri and amri , we briefly recap the results from the modal analysis of these instabilities in the local approach @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath86 or @xmath87 and as a result the shear - related term proportional to @xmath40 in @xmath88 , @xmath89 , as well as the time - dependence of the radial and total wavenumbers are ignored , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "this admits wkb approach in _ time _ when solution can be sought in the form @xmath92 with the adiabatic condition @xmath93 being fulfilled . substituting this into eq .",
    "( 5 ) and taking the relevant limit of small magnetic reynolds number , @xmath94 ( inductionless approximation ) , but high reynolds number , @xmath95 , we arrive at the following analytical expression for the growth rate @xmath96 @xcite , @xmath97 where @xmath98 an instability occurs when @xmath99 .",
    "now consider the cases of hmri and amri .",
    "hmri relies on the growth of axisymmetric ( @xmath100 ) perturbations and appears from @xmath101 . taking the limit of small interaction parameter , @xmath102 and then maximizing with respect to @xmath103 [ @xmath104 , eq .",

    "amri consists in the growth of non - axisymmetric perturbations and takes place when the azimuthal magnetic field dominates over axial one , corresponding to the limit @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) @xmath108 @xmath109 where now @xmath8 is appropriately defined in terms of @xmath33 , @xmath110 .",
    "if the interaction parameter is small , @xmath102 , and @xmath111 , eq .",
    "( 8) reduces to @xmath112 to the leading order in @xmath113 , the corresponding real part of the eigenfrequency is equal to the frequency of inertial waves ( with minus sign ) , @xmath114 .",
    "remarkably , both eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) yield the same stability boundary ( 1 ) defined by @xmath115 @xcite , which indicates that for the current - free field , @xmath116 , modal growth of hmri and amri exists at negative shear less than the lower liu limit , @xmath117 and at positive shear larger than the upper liu limit , @xmath118 , while at larger @xmath119 the stability region shrinks and the instability extends within the liu limits .",
    "so , the modal growth of hmri and amri can , in principle , also exist for the keplerian rotation ( @xmath120 ) starting from @xmath121 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( 8) it follows that in these intervals of rossby numbers , amri operates ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) only in a certain range of radial wavenumbers , outside this range @xmath122 and the perturbations decay due to resistivity",
    ". since we are interested in the effects of nonnormality on the dynamics of hmri and amri , below we focus on the current - free azimuthal field , i.e. , fix @xmath116 , where free energy for instability comes solely from shear .",
    "now we investigate the nonmodal growth of axisymmetric hmri by solving an initial value problem given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) as described in sec .",
    "1 , without restricting the time - dependence of harmonics ( modes ) to the exponential form , as accepted in modal analysis . in the case of axisymmetric hmri ,",
    "@xmath42 does not vary with time and hence the evolution matrix @xmath52 is stationary .",
    "figure 1 shows the maximum energy growth @xmath84 at modally stable and unstable @xmath17 together with the growth in the modally stable nonmagnetic case , where only the nonmodal growth is possible . for hmri",
    "we take the hartmann number @xmath123 . in all cases ,",
    "the initial stage of evolution is qualitatively similar : the energy increases with time , reaches a maximum @xmath124 and then decreases .",
    "this first nonmodal amplification phase is followed by minor amplifications . like in the case of modal growth",
    ", the kinetic energy dominates over the magnetic one also during nonmodal growth . as a result",
    ", the duration of each amplification event is set by inertial waves : the peak value @xmath124 is attained at around one quarter of the wave period , @xmath125 , similar to that in the nonmagnetic case , although its value is smaller than that in the latter case . at larger times",
    ", the optimal growth follows the behavior of the modal solution  it increases ( for @xmath126 ) , stays constant ( for the liu limits , @xmath127 ) or decays ( for @xmath128 ) , respectively , if the flow is modally unstable , neutral or stable ; in the latter case hmri undergoes only transient amplification .",
    "this is readily understood : at large times the least stable modal solution ( with growth rate given by eq .",
    "7 ) dominates , whereas at small and intermediate times the transient growth due the interference of nonorthogonal eigenfunctions is important . in particular , for the liu limits , where the modal growth is absent , there is moderate nonmodal growth @xmath129",
    ". a similar evolution of axisymmetric perturbations energy with time for hmri was already found in @xcite , where also the physical mechanism of hmri was explained in terms of an additional coupling between meridional and azimuthal flow perturbations .",
    "importantly , in fig . 1 , @xmath124 at modally stable and unstable rossby numbers are comparable and several times larger than the modal growth factors during the same time @xmath130 .",
    "indeed , for example , at @xmath131 the growth achieves the first peak @xmath132 at @xmath133 , while at this time the energy of the normal mode would have grown only by a factor of @xmath134=1.135 $ ] .",
    "this also implies that in the keplerian regime , where there is no modal growth of hmri for @xmath135 , it still exhibits moderate nonmodal growth ( red curve in fig .",
    "figure 2 , which is the central result of this paper , shows ( a ) the maximum growth @xmath124 in the magnetic and nonmagnetic cases as well as ( b ) the modal growth rate @xmath136 given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) versus @xmath137 .",
    "@xmath124 increases linearly with @xmath17 at @xmath138 and much steeper at @xmath139 which can be well approximated by @xmath140 . for comparison , in this plot",
    "we also show the maximum transient growth factor for axisymmetric perturbations in the nonmagnetic case , @xmath141 , from @xcite .",
    "so , although @xmath124 in the magnetic case is slightly smaller than that in the nonmagnetic one , the two curves are in fact close to each other and display nearly the same behavior with @xmath17 .",
    "note that the dependencies of @xmath124 , @xmath142 ( fig .",
    "2a ) and of the modal growth rate @xmath136 ( fig .",
    "2b ) on @xmath17 have very similar shapes . remarkably , the latter , being given by eq .",

    "both liu limits are therefore connected with a corresponding threshold @xmath145 .",
    "for non - axisymmetric amri , the radial wavenumber changes with time due to background shear and as a result its dynamics differs from that of axisymmetric hmri .",
    "the adiabatic wkb regime in time applies only at @xmath86 ( @xmath146 ) , then @xmath147 decreases with time and enters the non - adiabatic interval in the neighborhood of @xmath148 where the dispersion relation ( 8) and hence the modal approach are no longer applicable for the description of amri . in this case",
    ", one should resort to numerical integration of eq .",
    "( 5 ) to study the dynamics of perturbations and quantify their nonmodal amplification .",
    "it is in this non - adiabatic region where the effects of nonnormality manifest themselves and influence the dynamics of amri .",
    "obviously , the modes with such initial @xmath149 that do not lead to crossing the non - adiabatic interval , i.e. , with @xmath149 and @xmath150 having opposite signs , do not experience the transient growth and decay quickly due to resistivity . here",
    ", we restrict ourselves to most amplified @xmath151 modes , while the dynamics of other modes with larger @xmath40 , which usually grow less than the @xmath151 modes do , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of the maximum energy growth @xmath84 for these harmonics at various @xmath17 , including the keplerian rotation , and fixed @xmath152 .",
    "the function @xmath153 has been maximized over the initial wavenumber @xmath149 , which is negative ( positive ) at @xmath139 ( @xmath138 ) and @xmath154 .",
    "the hartmann number characterizing the azimuthal field is set to @xmath155 , which is typical for amri @xcite .",
    "initially , in the adiabatic region , the effect of resistivity on the mode is still appreciable .",
    "as the mode evolves , @xmath156 decreases with absolute value , resistive dissipation becomes weaker , while the effect of nonnormlity / shear gets stronger . as a result ,",
    "the energy starts to amplify , extracting energy from the background flow .",
    "then , @xmath156 decreasing further , enters the non - adiabatic region , where the effect of the nonnormality is largest . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath153 exhibits most of growth just in this interval of radial wavenumbers , reaching a maximum , @xmath124 , at different @xmath157 , which depend on @xmath17 , but are close to each other .",
    "the peak @xmath124 is higher , the larger is the shear @xmath158 ( see also fig .",
    "4 ) . afterwards , @xmath147 increases again , leaving the non - adiabatic area , and the harmonic s energy gradually decreases and eventually decays due to viscosity and resistivity at high enough @xmath42 .",
    "we refer to the whole process as the nonmodal growth of amri , which always lasts for a finite time in the local approach , because of the shear - induced time variation of the radial wavenumber of non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "note that , like in the case of hmri , moderate nonmodal growth occurs also at the liu limits and the keplerian rotation , which are , respectively , marginally stable and fully stable according to modal analysis . as mentioned above , the optimal perturbation and optimal growth formalism that we use here , as opposed to the modal approach , is the most general way to describe the dynamics of non - axisymmetric perturbations both in nonmodal and modal regimes . in the adiabatic regime , for hmri",

    "as was seen in fig.3 , the nonmodal growth is more than an order of magnitude larger at positive @xmath17 than at negative @xmath17 , indicating the importance of positive shear for amri , as was already shown recently in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath165 falls in the non - adiabatic regime , implying that the nonmodal approach is more appropriate to describe the dynamics of amri rather than modal one at the these vertical wavenumbers that yield the maximum growth . at @xmath87 ,",
