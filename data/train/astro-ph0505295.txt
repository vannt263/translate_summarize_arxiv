    "the quest to identify and understand protostars has long been a key but stubborn problem for star formation research @xcite .",
    "the primary factor hindering the investigation of protostellar objects has been the fact that such sources are deeply embedded in dusty molecular gas and are heavily extincted . as a result most of the luminosity generated by a protostar",
    "is absorbed and scattered by dust and radiated in the infrared , rendering the object very difficult , if not impossible , to detect at optical wavelengths .",
    "consequently , progress toward achieving a physical understanding of the nature of protostars had to wait for the development of observing capabilities at longer wavelengths .",
    "significant progress in understanding the physical nature and evolutionary status of protostars has been achieved from measurements of the broadband photometric infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of low - luminosity young stellar objects ( ysos ) in star forming molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "these studies established that the shape of the sed of a yso is linked to its evolutionary state .",
    "class i ( and class 0 ) sources were characterized by strong infrared excesses and steeply rising seds from near- to far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "these sources were found to be distinctly different from class ii sources .",
    "these latter objects were characterized by smaller infrared excesses and seds that decreased from near- to far - infrared wavelengths and could be well - explained by models of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars surrounded by circumstellar disks ( i.e. classical t - tauri stars ) .",
    "class ii sources , in turn , were differentiated from class iii sources which displayed no infrared excess and whose seds could be explained by normal stellar photospheres of classical pms stars .",
    "class i seds were found to be consistent with , and well - fit by , theoretical models of protostellar envelopes .",
    "moreover , other lines of evidence , such as the intimate association of class i ( and 0 ) sources with molecular outflows , molecular hydrogen emission , fu ori phenomenon , etc . strongly suggested an extreme youth and possibly protostellar nature for these objects .",
    "little is known about the underlying stellar component of protostars since these objects are typically undetectable in visible light rendering the traditional methods of optical spectroscopy that are used to measure stellar physical properties not generally applicable .",
    "however advances in technology over the past dozen years have enabled spectroscopic observations of class i sources at near - infrared wavelengths . in a pioneering paper , @xcite obtained low resolution ( r  @xmath6  300 ) spectra at 2 @xmath1 m of a sample of ten bright class i and class ii sources in ophiuchus and found class i sources to exhibit a featureless continuum , unlike class ii sources which displayed photospheric absorption lines .",
    "this result was confirmed by a subsequent low resolution ( r @xmath6 500 ) near - infrared spectroscopic survey of a significantly larger sample of @xmath6100 low luminosity ysos in ophiuchus and taurus @xcite . the absence of photospheric absorption lines in class i sources was interpreted as being the result of high veiling due to strong infrared excess emission produced by disk accretion and reprocessing in circumstellar envelopes .",
    "this provided strong supporting evidence for a protostellar nature for class i objects .",
    "however , the high veilings of class i sources indicated that very high signal - to - noise and high spectral resolution observations would be required to detect photospheric features and measure the physical parameters of the embryonic stellar core at the heart of a protostellar object .",
    "@xcite obtained the first such deep and high resolution ( r @xmath6 20,000 ) infrared spectra and detected photospheric absorption features in a sample of several flat - spectrum protostars .",
    "these embedded sources exhibit seds with shapes between those of class i and ii objects and are believed to be in transition between the class i and ii evolutionary states .",
    "flat - spectrum sources are likely to be extremely young and can be considered the least obscured candidate protostars .",
    "these objects were found to have late ( m0 or later ) spectral - types confirming their nature as low mass stellar objects and to be relatively fast rotators compared to class ii sources , an unexpected result .",
    "@xcite also obtained spectra of five class i sources , and all presented featureless spectra indicating that even more sensitive infrared observations would be necessary to detect the photospheres of these objects . using the 10 meter keck telescope , @xcite were able to obtain yet deeper observations and detect the first photospheric absorption lines in a heavily veiled accreting protostellar source , ylw  15 .",
    "these observations enabled determinations of the central source s spectral - type , veiling , stellar luminosity and allowed its placement on the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram .",
    "although most class i sources are deeply buried in dusty envelopes , visible light scattered off cavities in these envelopes can in some cases be detected at optical wavelengths with large ground - based telescopes .",
    "@xcite performed an i - band spectroscopic survey of 13 class i sources in taurus that were optically visible .",
    "they were able to detect photospheric features in 5 of these sources and found them to display late ( m ) spectral - types and to lie in the same general region of the h - r diagram as class ii sources .",
    "the optically - selected sample of taurus class i sources also did exhibit stronger and more frequent forbidden - line emission than class ii sources , suggesting higher mass outflow and accretion rates . a recent higher resolution , more sensitive optical spectroscopic survey of optically detected class i sources in taurus by @xcite produced spectral - types of 11 objects and generally confirmed the trends observed by @xcite , although the @xcite observations suggest similar accretion and rotation rates for class i and ii objects in their sample .",
    "these observations suggest that optically detectable class i sources may be in a more advanced state of evolution than the more common optically invisible class i protostars which are more deeply embedded .",
    "sensitive high resolution infrared and optical spectroscopy of flat - spectrum and class i sources represent a significant advance in protostellar studies and clearly have demonstrated the utility and potential of such observations for investigating protostellar evolution .",
    "a number of interesting issues have been raised by these observations .",
    "do the optically detectable class i sources represent the end stages of protostellar evolution ?",
    "are their physical properties similar to those of the optically invisible class i objects or is there a significant range in evolutionary states among class i objects from accretion active to accretion anemic objects ?",
    "to better define the physical properties and nature of class i sources and achieve a more complete understanding of protostellar evolution we have conducted the first extensive and systematic near - infrared spectral survey of deeply embedded class i and flat - spectrum objects carried out at high resolution and with the high sensitivity afforded by a 10 meter class telescope",
    ". we were able to obtain high quality spectra for more than 50 class i and flat - spectrum sources in three nearby regions of active star formation .",
    "photospheric absorption features were detected with good signal - to - noise in the vast majority of these sources . in order to derive the physical parameters that characterize these young stellar objects we have employed synthetic model atmospheres following the techniques successfully developed by @xcite ( hereafter dj03 ) in their recent study of infrared class ii sources in ophiuchus @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we present the results and analysis of our observations . in @xmath7 4",
    "we discuss the implications for the nature of class i and flat - spectrum sources in the context of protostellar evolution and in @xmath7 5 we summarize the results and conclusions of this contribution .",
    "this paper is the first in a series of three papers dealing with the results of our survey .",
    "two subsequent papers will respectively deal with the analysis of the rotational properties @xcite and radial velocities @xcite of this sample .",

    "our sample was comprised of 52 flat - spectrum or class i protostars : 2 in perseus , 13 in taurus , 20 in ophiuchus , 13 in serpens , and 4 in corona australis ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "these sources were selected from @xcite .",
    "in addition , 28 late - type giant and dwarf mk spectral standards were observed for calibration of our spectral synthesis models .",
    "near - ir spectra of the protostellar sample and mk spectral standards were acquired on 2000 may 29  30 , 2001 july 7  10 , 2001 november 4  6 , and 2003 june 19  21 ut . all data were acquired with the 10-m keck ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii , using the nirspec multi - order cryogenic echelle facility spectrograph @xcite .",
    "spectra were acquired with a 058 ( 4 pixel ) wide slit , providing spectroscopic resolution @xmath12 = 18,000 ( 16.7 km  s@xmath13 ) .",

    "the instrument s nirspec-7 blocking filter was used to image these orders on the detector .",
    "nirspec was configured to acquire simultaneously multiple cross - dispersed echelle orders 31  36 ( 2.08  2.45 @xmath1 m , non - continuous ) for most objects , but some objects were observed in orders 32  38 ( 1.97  2.38 @xmath1 m , non - continuous ) .",
    "each order had an observed spectral range @xmath16 ( @xmath17 4450 km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "the internal instrument rotator was used to maintain a fixed position angle on the sky when observing on 2000 may 29  30 .",
    "unfortunately vibration from the rotator caused slight changes in the echelle grating angle during those nights , but we removed the resultant wavelength shifts during the data reduction process .",
    "the slit was held physically stationary and thus allowed to rotate on the sky ( as the non - equatorially - mounted telescope tracked ) when observing at all other times .",
    "data were acquired in pairs of exposures of durations from less than 1 second ( for giant mk standards ) to up to 900 s ( for the protostars ) each , with the telescope nodded @xmath18 along the slit between frames so that object spectra were acquired in all exposures .",
    "early - type ( b7  a2 ) dwarfs were observed for telluric correction of the protostellar and mk standard stellar spectra .",
    "the telescope was automatically guided with frequent images from the nirspec internal scam ir camera during all exposures of more than several seconds duration .",
    "spectra of the internal nirspec continuum lamp were taken for flat fields , and exposures of the ar , ne , kr , and xe lamps were used for wavelength calibrations .",
    "the observation dates , total integration times , signal - to - noise , and other parameters of the observed objects are given in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "all data were reduced following standard procedures with iraf packages @xcite .",
    "bad pixels and cosmic rays were removed with the cosmicray task  images were cleaned once to remove cosmic rays and bad pixels , then inverted and cleaned again to remove cold pixels before being returned to positive flux .",
    "frames were then flatfield divided and sky subtracted before spectra were extracted with the apall task .",
    "extracted spectra were wavelength calibrated using 4th order fits to lines in arc lamp exposures , and all spectra of objects at the same slit position and similar airmasses were coadded .",
    "instrument vibration during the may 2000 observing run caused the echelle grating to shift slightly between lamp and object spectra exposures .",
    "corrections for the shift of the wavelength solution between objects were applied by using the fxcor task to find the pixel shift between object spectra and telluric standards observed closely after lamp spectra .",
    "this appears to have improved the wavelength solutions of the may 2000 data considerably , but radial velocities derived for objects observed during may 2000 will be significantly more uncertain than those objects observed on later runs .",
    "instrumental and telluric features were removed by dividing wavelength calibrated object spectra by spectra of early type stars observed at similar airmass and slit position .",
    "spectral orders containing the hi br  @xmath4 line ( 2.1661 @xmath1 m ) were corrected for telluric absorption with the use of the xtellcor idl routine developed by @xcite .",
    "this routine creates and then removes a pure telluric spectrum generated by dividing an observed early - type stellar spectrum by a synthetic model of vega ( modified to include line broadening ) .",
    "combined spectra were then produced by summing the spectra of both slit positions for each object .",
    "wavelength shifts have not been applied to correct for earth and solar system motions ; rather , radial velocities have been measured and then converted to radial velocities with respect to the local standard of rest . finally , the spectra of each wavelength sub - interval used in our analysis ( see @xmath7[sec - diaglines ] ) , was flattened and continuum normalized to one by linear function , so as to be directly comparable to the intrinsically flat continua of our synthesis models .    in order to view the true continuum shape within the three k - band orders where we analyze photospheric lines , we multiply the spectra of our ysos and mk standards by a 10,000 k blackbody following the telluric division by a hot ( b7  a2 ) telluric standard star . all these spectra are displayed in appendix [ sec - spectra ] ( figs .",

    "earlier studies have identified the strength of the co overtone band at 2.2935 @xmath1 m as being diagnostic of luminosity and surface gravity @xcite in stars that have already evolved to the main - sequence and beyond , and in class ii pms stars ( dj03 ) that are less likely to have contamination by co emission arising from disks or in outflow winds . for our class",
    "i and flat - spectrum ysos , we avoid using fits to the co interval to constrain temperature and gravity , since the strength of the bandhead absorption may be altered by non - stellar components .",
    "we develop a multi - parameter grid of synthetic spectra in which we search to find the best simultaneous fit to the wavelength intervals described in @xmath7  [ sec - diaglines ] , extending the spectral fitting techniques pioneered by dj03 to include these three distinct wavelength regions .",
    "the spectral synthesis code moog @xcite is used to generate a high resolution ( r  =   120,000 ) k - band spectrum of each wavelength interval based on lte radiative transfer through a nextgen @xcite stellar atmosphere profile ( see dj03 ) .",
    "each moog synthesis generates a model spectrum specific to a particular t@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and metallicity .",
    "we restrict our spectral search to objects with solar abundances @xcite , though , in principle , spectral fits using metallicity as another free search parameter have potential for future work when more diagnostic lines are present .",
    "physical constants ( i.e. oscillator strengths and damping coefficients ) are needed in order to model the correct depth and width for each absorption line transition in the synthetic spectra .",
    "for our spectral syntheses in the na and co intervals , we use atomic and molecular line constants published by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , no published oscillator strengths or damping coefficients were available in the literature or on - line ( i.e. vald or nist ) for the mg line transitions ( 3s4f@xmath33f@xmath343s7g@xmath35g@xmath36 ) at 2.1061 @xmath1 m in the mg / al interval .",
    "therefore , we determined these values empirically by fine tuning the models to best fit our observed spectra of several mk standard stars for which t@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and [ fe / h ] was known .",
    "we use solar micro - turbulence values ( 1 km  s@xmath13 ) , appropriate for our models of late - type stars with dwarf and sub - dwarf gravities ( dj03 ) .",
    "damping of the na lines , which are noticeably pressure broadened in the na interval in dwarf standards , has been tuned to best match an observed solar spectrum ( dj03 ) .",
    "once the basic synthesis grid has been created , a spectral search routine ( dj03 ) steps through each model spectrum , modifying it by incrementally adding rotational broadening ( @xmath22 ) , continuum veiling ( r@xmath29 ) , and fractional pixel wavelength shifts ( @xmath37 ) . broadening by stellar rotation is modeled by convolving our model spectra with a rotational broadening profile and an assumed limb - darkening coefficient of 0.6 @xcite .",
    "we simulate the amount of 2 @xmath1 m continuum veiling ( r@xmath29 ) by adding successive amounts of non - photospheric flux , assumed to be spectrally flat and featureless .",
    "a coarse value for the topocentric radial velocity is estimated by eye for each observed spectrum .",
    "then , 0.8 km  s@xmath13 shifts ( @xmath61/5 of a pixel ) are each tested over a @xmath385 km  s@xmath13 range to find the best radial velocity fit to each protostellar spectrum .    the search routine steps through a selected region of parameter space , modifying the spectral synthesis templates of all three wavelength intervals by modeling each unique combination of the five search parameters within the following range of values : 3000k  6000k ( t@xmath20 ) , 3.5  5.0 cm s@xmath39 ( @xmath21 ) , 0  80 km  s@xmath13 ( @xmath22 ) , 0  6.0 ( veiling , r@xmath29 ) , and @xmath385 km  s@xmath13 ( v@xmath23 ) .",

    "the quality of the fit between the observed protostellar spectrum and each spectral synthesis model is then quantified from the aforementioned selected wavelength sub - intervals as the root mean square ( rms ) of the residuals in the data - to - model comparison ( dj03 ) .",

    "[ fig-rmscontour.teff ] illustrates the rms error space in the veiling / effective temperature plane for the model fits to dg  tau .",

    "the range of the search grid in t@xmath20 and @xmath21 is constrained by the availability of the nextgen models @xcite which we use to generate the spectral synthesis templates .",

    "( 1 ) we use the na and mg / al wavelength intervals together as combined diagnostics of temperature , gravity , and veiling in an iterative process .",
    "initially , gravity is held fixed , while the best fit for temperature and veiling is found .",
    "then , temperature is fixed at the previous best - fit value while gravity and veiling were varied to find the best fit .",
    "this process is iterated until a best fit for all three parameters is found . by fitting both na and mg / al wavelength intervals",
    "simultaneously we usually converge to a unique value for effective temperature , gravity and veiling where the combined rms value from both na and mg / al intervals is lower and the error space more sharply defined than when either interval is used alone .",
    "therefore , we use both intervals weighted together , equally , as strong diagnostics for t@xmath20 and @xmath21 , as well as r@xmath29 .",
    "( 2 ) the broadening of the bandhead in the co interval is determined to be the most sensitive indicator of projected @xmath22 rotation of all our diagnostic lines .",
    "therefore @xmath22 is solely determined by the best fits to the co interval by first imposing the best t@xmath20 and @xmath21 from the na and mg / al intervals , while leaving the amount of veiling unconstrained , in favor of finding the best rotationally broadened spectral fit .",
    "this amount of broadening is likewise imposed on the fits in the other two intervals .",
    "radial velocities for each object are found as the mean of the velocity shifts between the observed and the best - fit synthetic spectra for each of three spectral regions independently .",
    "occasionally one of the three orders had a widely divergent derived velocity shift ; in these cases the discrepant point is discarded from the mean .",
    "the derived velocities are adjusted using the iraf package rvcorrect to account for motions due to the earth s solar and galactic orbits , allowing a calculation of v@xmath40 and v@xmath31 for each object .",
    "random errors present in the rms best - fit value of the spectral fits are due to the finite signal - to - noise present in our data . in order to calibrate a 3  @xmath41 change in the rms parameter search space",
    ", a test model spectrum was constructed using a particular synthesis model , representative of a typical yso fit in our sample : ( t@xmath28 = 3600k , @xmath21 = 4.0 , @xmath22 = 40 , and r@xmath29 = 3.0 ) .",
    "random gaussian noise was added to the test spectrum to achieve s / n  =  200 pixel@xmath13 before it was then run through the standard fitting routine .",
    "this was done many times with random noise seeds .",
    "a 1  @xmath41 variation in the best - fit rms value over many trial fits to the same spectrum with noise was @xmath42rms = 10@xmath43 . using this number",
    ", we calibrate the errors due to noise in each of the physical parameters using the rms error contour plots ( output by the spectral fitting routine for each fit ) . a change in the rms from the lowest value ( i.e. the best fit ) to a value that is bigger by 3 @xmath15 10@xmath43",
    ", then corresponds to the 3  @xmath41 random error along that new error contour line .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig-rmscontour.logg ] shows the error space contours in the @xmath21 vs r@xmath29 and @xmath21 vs @xmath22 planes corresponding to the best fits of these quantities in dg  tau .",
    "the asterisks mark the minima in the error space ( rms = 4.2 @xmath15 10@xmath44 and 4.5 @xmath15 10@xmath44 ) and each contour interval corresponds to an _ increase _ of 3 @xmath15 10@xmath43 ( 3  @xmath41 contours ) , resulting in a calibrated change for each parameter .",
    "therefore , the error space in each of four parameter fit planes ( t@xmath20 vs @xmath22 ) , ( t@xmath20 vs r@xmath29 ) , ( @xmath21 vs @xmath22 ) , ( @xmath21 vs r@xmath29 ) is characterized by changes of 10@xmath43 ( 1  @xmath41 ) from the best - fit rms value .",
    "random errors in the four parameters are generally smaller than systematic errors .    the best model fit to each observed protostellar spectrum is associated with an initial seeded @xmath21 value , where the initial seed value for @xmath21 is assumed and held fixed while the spectral fitting routine then finds the best - fit t@xmath20 . following this",
    ", the routine then holds the new best - fit t@xmath20 fixed and searches for the corresponding best fit for @xmath21 , and so forth .",
    "thus , the routine finds an rms minimum within the 5 parameter search space , iterating between the t@xmath20 and @xmath21 search planes . sometimes there is more than one local minima in the solution and different initial seed values for @xmath21 fit to different best - fit solutions . in this case , differences in the different rms minima are compared and the overall best solution is taken as the global minimum of all different seeded best fits .",

    "comparison of the two plots shows that class i and flat - spectrum central stars span a very similar range of luminosity and effective temperature as class ii sources . for both types of sources",
    "there is a relatively large scatter in their positions on the h - r diagrams .",
    "these findings are similar to those derived from optical spectroscopy of class i sources in taurus @xcite .",
    "classical pms theory would suggest that class i sources should appear at or near the birth - line , however pms models that include the effects of accretion indicate that accreting stars evolve more quickly down hayashi tracks than non - accreting stars and should appear at lower luminosities than non - accreting stars of the same age @xcite . thus the locations of class i sources below the birthline are consistent with expectations for accreting stars .",
    "however , because class i sources should be systematically younger than class ii objects the class i stars should on average be more luminous than the class ii sources which does not appear to be the case for the objects we observed .",
    "however as discussed below large uncertainties in both derived source luminosities and the locations of theoretical tracks on the h - r diagram may mask such an effect .    in figure [ fig-hrd.logg ] , we plot the surface gravities vs effective temperatures for class i and flat - spectrum sources in the same clouds along with the predictions of theoretical models of pms evolution .",

    "this is almost certainly an unphysical result .",
    "for example from statistical arguments the class i phase is thought to be only about 10@xmath59 years in duration , considerably shorter than the spread of sources on the h - r and surface gravity diagrams would suggest .",
    "moreover , the observed color - magnitude diagrams of slightly older ( @xmath60 myr ) young clusters exhibit very well - defined pre - main sequences with nearly coeval age spreads of typically less than 23 myr @xcite .",
    "together these facts suggest that the observed spreads on the h - r diagrams for a very young stellar population ( @xmath6 13 myr ) are a result of factors other than age , factors that introduce systematic uncertainties in the locations of stars on the h - r diagram .",
    "these factors include intrinsic source variability , uncertainty in extinction corrections , binarity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as effects of accretion on the positions of accreting stellar objects on the h - r diagram @xcite .",
    "protostellar luminosities are dominated by scattering and disk accretion and thus determination of the stellar component of the luminosity from observed photometry is likely one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the vertical positions of class i and flat - spectrum objects on the h - r diagram .",
    "errors in stellar luminosities derived from near - ir photometry in our sources are dominated by uncertainties in judging the intrinsic near - ir colors of these embedded sources ( @xmath7 [ sec - photlums ] ) .",
    "relying on the assumption that these objects are radiating isotropically is problematic since the stellar light can be partially blocked by disks or scattered through cavities .",
    "@xcite find that the stellar luminosity in t - tauri stars can be underestimated by up to @xmath6 50% ( factor @xmath62 in age ) due to occultation by opaque disks at various inclination angles .",
    "luminosities of class i sources in taurus report uncertainties of @xmath633% - 50% for objects",
    "whose optical spectra are seen only in scattered light @xcite .",
    "the geometry of protostellar disks is clearly important to making accurate measurements of the luminosity emanating from an embedded source , and overestimates in the apparent age can result if this is not accounted for .",
    "this effect has been seen by others as well ; the h - r diagrams of @xcite show that class i ysos and ysos driving herbig - haro flows in taurus - auriga which have edge - on disks have low luminosities making them to appear to have very high ages , on the order of 10@xmath61 yr .",
    "uncertainties in our spectroscopic measurements of gravity stem from our fits to key photospheric lines ( see @xmath7 [ sec - qualityfits ] ) , whose shapes and depths are affected by combinations of physical parameters ( i.e. t@xmath20 , @xmath21 , r@xmath29 ) that are difficult to completely separate in finite signal - to - noise data .",
    "a theoretical uncertainty in using h - r diagrams to measure masses and ages lies in the reliability of the placement of evolutionary model tracks which permit us to convert observables into fundamental intrinsic properties .",
    "the presence of accretion delays the formation of a radiative core @xcite , which offsets the isochrones toward lower luminosities and higher gravities in cool ( t@xmath62 5800k ) ysos @xcite . depending on the accretion history , and initial mass , overestimates in the ages vary between 30% and a factor of 5 when compared to models without accretion ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "it is quite likely therefore that the large spreads in the stellar luminosities and gravities that we find for our class i and flat - spectrum sources are not due to real spreads in age , but represent uncertainties in the intrinsic colors , extinctions , and emitting geometry of each star , along with observational uncertainties in their spectra .",
    "therefore differences in the stellar luminosities of class i / flat - spectrum and class ii sources are extremely difficult to detect in observational h - r diagrams and comparisons of derived luminosities and ages between these objects are not likely meaningful . moreover ,",
    "when the observational uncertainties are coupled with uncertainties in the pms evolutionary tracks it is evident that class i and flat - spectrum ages can not be confidently extracted from h - r diagrams .",

    "* ) , most co overtone emission fits profiles of rapid keplerian rotation ( up to 400 km  s@xmath13 ) originating from an inner disk @xcite .",
    "the rotation profile of a disk is distinctly double peaked in velocity space @xcite because different disk regions have different keplerian velocities and different co emission strengths .",

    "the modest red - shifts ( v@xmath66 65 km  s@xmath13 ) we observe in these br  @xmath4 absorption components ( relative to the emission peak ) suggests that accretion may be occurring through the inner disk in this stage before it could become disrupted and truncated in a later evolutionary stage @xcite .",
    "four ysos have br  @xmath4 absorption without the presence of any emission . the strongest and broadest of these is 03260 + 3111a , whose equivalent width ( 3.4  @xmath67 ) and broadened line wings are consistent with br  @xmath4 absorption we see in late g - type dwarf standards , confirming its relatively warm t@xmath20 ( 5600k ) derived from spectral fits to photospheric lines in the na and mg / al intervals .",

    "the likely explanation for this is that either the br  @xmath4 absorption arises from a non - photospheric mechanism @xcite , or else these are binary systems with both early and late - type components .",
    "if the latter is true , then the early - type star must cause significant veiling of the k - band photospheric features of the late - type star in each system , by nature of their relative temperatures and the larger radii of the early - type stars . this does not apply for ec  92 and ec  95 which have veiling r@xmath29 = 0.0 and 0.1 , respectively . in the case of ec  53 which has veiling r@xmath29 = 1.8 , an earlier spectral - type binary component that is warm enough to have photospheric br  @xmath4 absorption lines ( i.e. t@xmath20 @xmath11 4200k ) would mask the lines ( r@xmath68 ) of the cooler star ( t@xmath20 = 3400k ) .",

    "the class i and flat - spectrum objects must have more warm circumstellar material , making it likely that they are in a more embedded and younger evolutionary state .",
    "@xcite have shown that hi br  @xmath4 emission is well - correlated with mass accretion in t - tauri stars , and we now evaluate whether r@xmath29 and br  @xmath4 emission are correlated in our class i and flat - spectrum sample . in figure [ fig-brg.veil ]",
    "we plot br  @xmath4 line luminosity ( after correcting for extinction and distance ) for sources where we also were able to measure r@xmath24 .",
    "these two parameters are positively correlated , but fig .",
    "[ fig-brg.veil ] shows too much scatter ( perhaps due to uncertain extinction corrections or asymmetrically distributed circumstellar material ) to confirm that both r@xmath29 and br  @xmath4 emission are reliable mass accretion diagnostics for class i and flat - spectrum ysos .",
    "using our measured br  @xmath4 luminosities , the @xcite relation suggests that our @xmath2 oph sources have accretion luminosities 10@xmath72 , while taurus and serpens have about an order of magnitude less .",
    "however , we note that many of the objects in our sample have been observed to have significantly higher bolometric ( accretion ) luminosities @xcite , and the @xcite relation was derived for class ii objects with low accretion luminosities",
    ". therefore the absolute accretion luminosities derived from br  @xmath4 fluxes are likely to be underestimates , although the relative difference between @xmath2 oph and the other regions is interesting and may be real .",
    "the above discussion has demonstrated that analysis of spectroscopic features provides much more detailed information on the natures of ysos than can be ascertained from sed shapes alone .",
    "we now examine the extent to which the aggregate of information derived from our spectra provides insight into the true physical natures and evolutionary status of class i and flat - spectrum ysos . as part of this effort",
    ", we also assess whether this new information supports the established paradigm that class i objects are protostars near the ends of their bulk mass accretion phases that then evolve to class ii or class iii ysos .",
    "our analysis has shown that class i and flat - spectrum ysos have some astrophysical properties which are similar and some which are considerably different from class ii and iii ysos . as noted in @xmath7 [ sec - hrdiags ] , our class i and flat - spectrum sample",
    "have effective temperatures , surface gravities , and stellar luminosities which are similar to those of class ii pms stars .",
    "this is not completely unexpected given the relatively large uncertainties in stellar luminosities determined for class i and flat - spectrum objects ( @xmath7 [ sec - photlums ] ; see also figure [ fig-hrd.lstar ] ) , and the stellar cores of steadily accreting protostars are expected to be in near hydrostatic equilibrium with radii and central temperatures similar to t - tauri stars @xcite .    however , other intrinsic astrophysical properties of class i and flat - spectrum objects do differ significantly from class ii or class iii pms stars . in @xmath7 [ sec-cont.emis ]",
    ", we determined that the k - band veilings of @xmath2 oph class i and flat - spectrum ysos are significantly higher than those of @xmath2 oph class ii objects , indicating more circumstellar material and higher mass accretion in class i and flat - spectrum objects .",
    "also , our class i and flat - spectrum sample has significantly higher @xmath73 sin @xmath74 rotation velocities and angular momenta than class ii and t - tauri pms stars the tau - aur and @xmath2 oph regions . if a young star is magnetically locked to its disk via its magnetic field , popular magnetospheric accretion models predict that the disk coupling radius is proportional to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the mass accretion rate onto the star @xcite .",
    "this means that ysos with higher accretion rates should be rotating faster than low accretion rate objects , with angular velocities @xmath77 ( for a full discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary ,",
    "all fundamental astrophysical properties derived in this study appear to support the paradigm that class i and flat - spectrum ysos are accreting protostars . in this respect",
    "our results appear to differ from those of @xcite who found that most optically - selected class i ysos in tau - aur have mass accretion rates , accretion luminosities , and rotation velocities that are not significantly different from class ii and t - tauri stars in the same region .",
    "furthermore , @xcite conclude that the similarity of class i and class ii / t - tauri spectral - types and stellar luminosities imply that these objects have similar ages and masses .",
    "therefore @xcite argue that class i and ii ysos are not in different evolutionary states and that class i objects are no longer in their main mass accretion phases of evolution .",
    "we note that we argued in @xmath7 [ sec - hrdiags ] that conventional pms models can not yield ages of class i and flat - spectrum ysos because they lack accretion physics .    in an attempt to reconcile these results ,",
    "we first investigate whether the optical spectroscopy analysis technique of @xcite yields the same parameters as our analysis for objects observed in both studies .",
    "eight objects were observed in both studies , and we derive astrophysical parameters for all of them .",
    "the six sources with astrophysical properties derived in both studies are 04016 + 2610 , 04158 + 2805 , dg  tau , gv  tau , haro  6 - 28 , and 04489 + 3042 . both studies derive similar effective temperatures ( within 350k ; converted from the spectral - type designations of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for all 6 objects except dg  tau , which @xcite find to be significantly earlier ( about 650k warmer ) than we do ( table [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "the high optical and ir veilings of this object may contribute to uncertainties in the spectral - type and effective temperature derived for this object .",
    "the @xmath22 rotation velocities of 5 of these 6 objects also agree well ( to several km  s@xmath13 ) , with the exception of 04016 + 2610 .",
    "@xcite derive @xmath78 km  s@xmath13 for this object , while we report 46 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "we suggest that the very low signal - to - noise in the optical spectrum ( s / n @xmath6 2 ) may be responsible for this discrepancy , and it is likely that our higher signal - to - noise spectrum ( s / n @xmath0 240 ) yields the less uncertain value .",
    "overall it appears that both studies yield similar astrophysical parameters for common sources .",
    "the differences in the conclusions between the two studies may be due to differences in the underlying physical properties of the ir and optically - selected samples that were analyzed .",
    "@xcite find that class i ysos do not have higher rotation velocities or higher mass accretion rates ( as inferred from veiling and luminosity measurements ) than class ii objects .",
    "they do not derive astrophysical parameters for two of the eight objects common in both studies , l1551  irs5 and 04295 + 2251 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the @xmath22 rotation velocities of these objects are 31 and 51 km  s@xmath13 , considerably higher than the median rotation velocity of 19.8 km  s@xmath13 of the @xcite class i sample ( see their table 3 ) .",
    "the five class i or flat - spectrum tau - aur ysos in our sample which were not observed by @xcite are not optically visible , and we find 4 of the 5 to be highly veiled r@xmath79 , with 2 of those veiled to the point where they have no discernible absorption features ( r@xmath80 ; see figure [ fig-vsini.veil ] ) .",
    "this suggests that optically - selected class i ysos may have less veiling and less accretion luminosity than ir - selected ones .",
    "also , tau - aur ysos have been known to have lower bolometric luminosities @xcite , and presumably lower mass accretion luminosities and rates than those in the @xmath2 oph star forming region @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite did not account for the fact that several of their class i objects ( and a few of their class ii ones ) were too veiled to determine their astrophysical parameters , so they did not compute mass accretion rates or rotation velocities for these objects",
    ". therefore the median mass accretion rates and rotation velocities computed in that study are likely biased by these omissions .",
    "the above discussion suggests that class i sources span a wide range of stellar and circumstellar properties , from actively accreting to relatively quiescent objects .",
    "we do believe that our large sample of ir - selected class i and flat - spectrum ysos from several star forming regions does give the most accurate picture to date of their true natures as accreting protostars .",
    "we have acquired high resolution near - ir spectra of a sample of 52 class i and flat - spectrum ysos located in the tau - aur , @xmath2 oph , ser , and other nearby dark clouds .",
    "we have derived their fundamental astrophysical properties via fitting their spectra to theoretical spectra synthesized from the nextgen @xcite pms models and make the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "we detect absorption lines in 41 of the 52 objects .",
    "this is a much higher number and fraction than earlier studies because of the high sensitivity and spectral resolution of the keck ii telescope and its nirspec spectrograph .",
    "twenty - three of the objects show 2.2235 @xmath1 m h@xmath3 emission lines . 2 .",
    "thirty - four objects show hi br  @xmath4 emission lines , and 6 of these show br  @xmath4 absorption as well .",
    "the absorptions are modestly red - shifted in all cases , indicating accretion in those objects .",
    "@xmath5 co emission is seen in 15% of the objects , indicating that co emission and active circumstellar disks are more common than expected from earlier studies .",
    "the absorption spectra are fit well by the synthetic spectra , indicating that the objects have effective temperatures and surface gravities which are consistent with pms stars .",
    "the spectral fitting procedure also yields rotation velocities , radial velocities , and k - band veilings .",
    "the objects show a wide range of effective temperatures and stellar luminosities , and these values overlap with those of class ii and t - tauri stars when placed in h - r diagrams .",
    "the class i and flat - spectrum objects have low masses which span the same range as class ii and t - tauri stars , but significant observational and theoretical uncertainties preclude deriving meaningful and accurate luminosities and ages for protostellar sources from placement on the h - r diagram and comparison with conventional pms models .",
    "we find that the mean k - band veiling of class i and flat - spectrum ysos in @xmath2 oph is significantly higher than for class ii objects in this region .",
    "this indicates that the class i and flat - spectrum objects are accreting at higher rates , which is bolstered by an analysis of their angular momentum properties in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "we also find that k - band veilings vary somewhat between class i and flat - spectrum ysos in different regions , with the @xmath2 oph objects having the highest veiling values , @xmath81 .",
    "we conclude that class i and flat - spectrum ysos are indeed actively accreting protostars , although they span a wide range of accretion activity .",
    "high resolution near - ir spectra provide sufficiently detailed information to diagnose the stellar and circumstellar properties of nearly any class i or flat - spectrum yso .",

    "furthermore , there are two resolved bandhead peaks ( separated by 64 km  s@xmath13 ) , with evidence of beating in the r branch lines . a conical high velocity neutral wind in the plane of the sky viewed at low inclination angles @xcite might explain the well - separated blue and red - shifted bandhead components .",
    "however , narrow co disk emission lines ( 4050 km  s@xmath13 wide ) have only been observed in one other yso ( svs  13 ) , but are too narrow to fit emission models for either a circumstellar disk or outflow @xcite , unless there is rotational coupling between the star and inner disk or if co originates from a lower velocity flow .",
    "strong br  @xmath4 emission is also observed in this source .",
    "a model that includes in - falling material from a truncated disk accompanied by a outflowing wind might best describe these observations .",

    "the relatively warm t@xmath20 ( 5900k ) we derive from photospheric lines in the na and mg / al intervals and the presence of br  @xmath4 absorption at the same radial velocity , argues that the origin of the br  @xmath4 absorption is photospheric .",
    "if co absorption is also present , it must originate in a disk or a wind , since photospheric co is dissociated in warmer stars .",

    "this object is the warmest and most luminous protostar that we measure stellar properties for . without making a correction for scattered light ( see @xmath7 [ sec - photlums ] ) , we derive a stellar luminosity of 24.7 l@xmath82 , based on the apparent flux at k from the north component ( m@xmath83=8.7 , * ? ? ?",

    "the co emission ( blue - shifted even more than the absorption ) could then be formed in an outflow wind , while the red - shifted ( @xmath650 km  s@xmath13 ) br  @xmath4 absorption line indicates in - falling material and accretion .",
