    "grs 1915 + 105 exhibits a range of variability in its light curve and power density spectra ( pds ) , along with other peculiar features like near - eddington accretion rate consistent for 20 years , jet activities @xmath4 from steady radio flickering to super - luminal radio ejections @xcite and regular transitions into various spectral states in time - scale from msec to hours @xcite .",
    "the timing analysis features 14 variability classes with each having their own peculiar light curves , phase / time - lags and coherence @xcite . among the 14 variability classes , the @xmath0 class shows characteristic limit - cycle variability in the time - scale of 50@xmath4100 sec with large amplitude oscillations in x@xmath4ray intensity by nearly an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "a promising model for the @xmath0 class variability is that it is driven by radiation pressure instability @xcite .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the instability suggests that there is need to change the viscous prescription and take into account a fraction of energy dissipating in a corona to explain the overall x - ray modulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "phase resolved spectroscopy of the variability reveals a consistent picture where the instability causes the inner disk radius to vary with the luminosity variation , which may be due to mass ejection from the system @xcite .",
    "the spectral modeling at different phases show complex components consisting of disk emission and a power - law with a high energy cutoff .",
    "an alternate approach to phase resolved spectroscopy is to understand the energy dependent phase lag and rms spectra of an oscillation .",
    "this is particularly useful for quasi periodic oscillations ( qpo ) .",
    "such analysis of high frequency qpos can give crucial information regarding the size of the emitting region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for the low frequency ones the causal connection between spectral parameters @xcite .",
    "@xcite have considered both energy dependent rms and phase resolved spectroscopy to argue that the low frequency qpo in the @xmath5 state has a geometric origin .",
    "frequency resolved spectroscopy at the qpo frequency which is related to the energy dependent rms curves can provide crucial information regarding the nature of the oscillation @xcite .",
    "@xcite report hard photon time - lags for the @xmath0 class variability which they interpret as the delay for the corona to adjust to a varying accretion rate .",
    "indeed the magnitude of the time delays of the order of seconds implies that it is not due to light travel time effects and instead should be associated with time delays between different structural parameters . since the inner disk radius is known to vary during the oscillation @xcite , it would be interesting to see if energy dependent time - lags and the rms spectra of the different harmonics of the oscillation can provide insight into how the the inner radius varies with the accretion rate .    as we describe below the time - lag and rms spectra for the @xmath0 class variability",
    "is fairly complex and our motivation is to identify the simplest model which can describe not only the behaviour of the fundamental but also simultaneously that of the next harmonic .",
    "we assume that the x@xmath4ray emission primarily consists of two components , a soft disk blackbody and a hard x@xmath4ray power - law extending from @xmath1 1 kev to high energies due to a corona .",
    "we neglect contributions from the iron line emission and other reflection features ..    the blackbody disk flux is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy of the photon , @xmath8 is the radius , @xmath9 is the inner disk radius and t(r ) is the surface disk temperature . from the standard disk blackbody model",
    ", we have @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the accretion rate .",
    "the power - law component is taken to be @xmath13 where it has been assumed that the normalization of the power - law depends on the accretion rate ( @xmath14 ) while for simplicity the photon index @xmath15 does not vary .",
    "the variation of the total flux @xmath16 due to variations of the accretion rate and inner radius , to second order is given by @xmath17 here we denote the normalized variation @xmath18 and define @xmath19    we assume that the inner disk radius follows the accretion rate with a time delay defined by : @xmath20 and that the accretion rate undergoes a pure sinusoidal variation at an angular frequency @xmath21 @xmath22 which drives the variability of the inner radius , @xmath23 where @xmath24 substituting the above in eqn ( [ eqndft ] ) , and collecting terms proportional to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for the fundamental oscillation , we get : @xmath27 and for the next harmonic : @xmath28 the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are derived and listed in appendix ( a ) .",
    "the ratio of the power - law to disk flux @xmath31 can be conveniently written as @xmath32 the function @xmath33 is given in appendix b and @xmath34 is a parameter which can be obtained from the time - averaged spectrum .",
    "the energy dependent rms for the fundamental and next harmonic are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 while the phase lag with respect to a reference energy @xmath37 is given by the phase of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the energy dependent variations @xmath40 and @xmath41 given by equations ( [ eqndftf ] ) and ( [ eqndfth ] ) depend on several parameters which can be divided into two groups .",
    "the parameters of the first group can be estimated from the time averaged spectrum which are the inner disk temperature @xmath42 , the high energy photon index @xmath15 and @xmath34 which parametrizes the ratio of the power - law to disk flux .",
    "the parameters of the second group pertain to the nature of the oscillation and are the exponents for inner disk radius ( @xmath43 ) , the power - law flux ( @xmath44 ) with the accretion rate , @xmath45 which is the phase difference ( between the inner disk radius & the accretion rate ) and an over all normalization of the variation @xmath46 .",
    "thus in this simplistic model , the energy dependent rms and time - lag for the fundamental and next harmonic are completely specified by these four parameters . of these the normalization of the variability",
    "@xmath46 determines the normalization of the rms of the fundamental while its square determines that of the next harmonic .    to illustrate the dependence of the predicted energy dependent rms and lag of this model on parameters , we show as an example in figure ( [ nvar ] ) the predicted curves for different values of the power - law to disk flux ratio characterized by @xmath34 while the other parameters of the model are fixed at some fiduciary values i.e. @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath44 & @xmath49 at @xmath50 kev , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "a salient feature of the model is that the time - lag increases with energy and then decreases .",
    "this occurs because the high energy photons are dominated by the power - law component which varies with the accretion rate without any time - delay . on the other hand ,",
    "the low energy photons from the disk component are more sensitive to the accretion rate rather than the inner radius .",
    "thus the low energy photons from the disk and the high energy ones from the power - law component have relatively less time delay as compared to photons with energy close to @xmath42 , which depend significantly on the inner radius which is assumed to be delayed with respect to the accretion rate .",
    "thus , the turnover energy depends sensitively on the flux ratio of the power - law and disk components characterized by the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "since the ratio can be estimated from the time - averaged spectrum , there is little leverage to tune the other parameters to get the observed lag turnover energy .    in figure ( [ betavar ] )",
    ", we show the rms and time - lag for variations for another important parameter @xmath43 which is the exponent specifying the relation between the inner radius and the accretion rate .",
    "it is interesting to note the sensitive behaviour of the time - lag for the next harmonic to @xmath43 where small changes in @xmath43 lead to dramatic qualitative changes i.e. from hard to soft lags . in figure ( [ powvar ] ) , are shown the rms and time - lag variations for different photon indices .",
    "the behaviour is similar to that observed from the figure([nvar ] ) since the ratio @xmath56 given by eqn ( [ eqndft1 ] ) depends on @xmath34 and @xmath47 .",
    "the ` @xmath0 ' variability class shows a range of frequencies from @xmath1 10 - 20 mhz with the occasional presence of multiple harmonics . using rxte / pca archival data for",
    "the white noise - subtracted , rms - normalized power density spectrum observed during ` @xmath0 ' class on 23 may , 2001 ( obs - id : 60405 - 01 - 02 - 00 ) is shown in the top panel of figure [ powspec ] fitted with multiple lorentians and a power - law with a break frequency at @xmath1 0.1 hz . residuals of the fit are shown in the lower panel . from the fitting , the fundamental and the next three harmonics are clearly detected with @xmath57 3@xmath58 significance at 19.5@xmath59 mhz , 39.1@xmath60 mhz , 58.6@xmath61 mhz and 78.2@xmath62 mhz respectively .    for the above observation",
    ", we obtain the time averaged photon spectrum from standard2 data file of pca . for data extraction , we use pcu2 only since it is reliably on throughout the observation and has the best calibration accuracy . using pca responses and latest background spectral",
    "file , the source spectrum in the energy range 3.0@xmath425.0 kev is fitted with a two component model : multi - colour disk blackbody ( @xmath63 in @xmath64 ) model and a simple power - law ( @xmath65 in @xmath64 ) , along with a gaussian component at @xmath1 6.4 kev and all components are modified by galactic absorption ( @xmath66 in @xmath64 ) .",
    "the fit gave a @xmath67 and the best fit spectral parameters are listed in table ( [ tabledat ] ) .",
    "we calculate time - lag spectra using cross spectrum techniques @xcite in different energy bands in the range 3.20 @xmath4 19.85 kev , where the reference band for lag calculation is chosen to be 3.69 @xmath4 4.52 kev at both fundamental and harmonic frequencies .",
    "the rms was calculated by computing the power spectrum for different energy bins .",
    "each power spectrum was fitted with a broken power - law and lorentzians as shown in fig .",
    "[ powspec ] . then by integrating the fitted components ,",
    "the rms was calculated .",
    "table ( [ tabledat ] ) shows the values of the parameters used to model the observed lag and fractional rms . as can be seen in fig.([datafig ] ) , the time - lag at fundamental ( top left panel ) shows a reversal around @xmath1 12 kev while for the next harmonic ( top right panel ) the time - lag seems to rise at least up to @xmath1 20 kev .",
    "however , the model - predicted spectrum fits the data well and the extension of the fitted model till 40 kev shows saturation around 25 kev . because of poor coherence and poor statistics above 20 kev for rxte / pca , we are unable to verify the model - predicted saturation using actual data . while a detailed analysis of the energy dependent rms and time - lag for different observations during the @xmath0 class variability will be presented elsewhere ( mir et .",
    "al . to be submitted ) , here we have used one observation as a typical example .",
    "we note that the qualitative behaviour of the energy dependence is fairly generic .",
    "indeed , the detailed phase resolved spectroscopy of different observations also show that the energy dependence is similar despite changes in the frequency of the oscillations @xcite    c c c cc kt@xmath68 & n@xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & n + ( kev ) & & & & + 1.47@xmath72 & 220@xmath73 & 2.85@xmath74 & 34@xmath75 & 3.15@xmath76 + @xmath43 & @xmath77 & @xmath44 & @xmath78 + 0.73 & 2.25 & 0.1 & 0.47 +    note : kt@xmath68 is the inner disk temperature ( kev ) , @xmath79 is the photon power - law index , @xmath80 is the normalization of the disk blackbody component @xmath81 is the power - law component normalization and @xmath34 is obtained from the spectral information .",
    "@xmath34 is related to the ratio between the normalizations of power - law and disk blackbody ( appendix b ) .",
    "@xmath43 is the power - law variation of @xmath82 with @xmath83 , @xmath45 is the phase difference , @xmath44 is the dependence of power - law normalization on @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the amplitude of the accretion rate variability .",

    "grs 1915 + 105 shows a fascinating clockwork in its @xmath0-class , reflected in the highly periodic light curves which resemble closely to the human cardiogram , thus is also called as heartbeat state .",
    "we have studied the energy - dependent frequency resolved lags and fractional rms of this variability and they show a unique behaviour . with the lags of the order of few seconds , they can not be attributed to light crossing time effects or due to comptonization delays .",
    "the interesting feature is that the lag at the fundamental frequency show a phase reversal @xmath1 10kev while at the next harmonic it keeps increasing with energy .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude at the fundamental and the next harmonic are also non - monotonic with energy .",
    "we show , that these qualitative features can be explained in a model where the power - law component varies directly with the accretion rate while the inner disk radius responds after a time delay ( droid ) .",
    "apart from parameters estimated from the time averaged spectrum , the energy dependent rms and time lag for the fundamental as well as the next harmonic are specified by only four free parameters and hence it is remarkable that such a simple picture can even qualitatively reproduce the overall features .    it should be emphasized that the analysis of energy dependent time - lag and rms and the model proposed to explain them are not different but complimentary to the phase resolved spectroscopy done earlier by @xcite .",
    "indeed as expected both analysis find that the basic feature of the oscillation is that the inner disk radius oscillates .",
    "the analysis done here provides another way of analyzing and understanding the data .",
    "moreover , for observations of other types of oscillations , energy dependent rms and time - lag may be more easily estimated than performing a complete phase resolved spectroscopy .",
    "a remarkable feature of this model is that the primary driver is a pure sinusoidal oscillation in the accretion rate and the other harmonics can be attributed to the non - linear relationship between the accretion rate and the inner disk radius as well as that between the two and the emergent spectrum .",
    "as the accretion rate increases the disk extends inwards , but this does not happen instantaneously .",
    "the inner disk responds after a time - delay that is found for this observation to be @xmath85 secs , which may be noted to be of the order of the viscous timescale .",
    "thus our results present a scenario which has the potential to be developed into a physical interpretation based on the nature of the accretion disk instability .",
    "the spectral components used in this model are simplistic . instead of a power - law",
    ", the high energy component should be correctly modeled as a thermal comptonization spectrum where the comptonized flux should depend on the accretion rate .",
    "this will lead to variations in the spectral index which is considered in this work to be a constant .",
    "moreover , there should also be a reflection component which may play an important part in the qpo formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the time - lag measured and modelled in this work is of the order of few seconds . unless the reflector is significantly far away from the central object , any time - lag between the continuum and the reflection component ( which is of the order sub - millisecs to few millisecs for a @xmath1 10 @xmath86 black hole ) can be neglected for the analysis done here .",
    "however , the rms spectra obtained from agn ( e.g. , mcg 6@xmath430@xmath415 ) do show significant dip @xcite at the position of 6.4 kev fe emission line which is solely due to reflection .",
    "therefore , instead of a powerlaw the combined continuum and reflection component needs to be considered , which will effect the results primarily in the iron line region @xcite",
    ". such analysis would necessarily involve complex numerical computation which is presently out of scope of this work but can be considered as an extension of the present idea in future .",
    "it is likely that the deviation of the data from the predicted model , especially for the shape of the energy dependent rms curves , arises because of the simple spectral model used .",
    "a more realistic model would warrant fitting the data statistically and obtaining parameter values with confidence limits .",
    "it will be interesting to study how the parameters of the model change for different oscillations of the @xmath0 class , especially as a function of the frequency of the oscillations .",
    "such a study will shed light on structural changes that occur during these oscillations and will help in obtaining a complete hydrodynamic understanding of the phenomenon .",
    "finally , the model maybe applicable to other qpos observed in different systems where the disc component varies significantly during the oscillation .",
    "observations of different black hole systems by the recently launched indian multi - wavelength satellite astrosat is expected to provide high quality event tagged data which would be ideally suited for such analysis .",
