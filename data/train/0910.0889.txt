    "sub - wavelength plasmonic crystals are a class of _ meta - material _ that possesses a microstructure consisting of a periodic array of plasmonic inclusions embedded within a dielectric host .",
    "the term `` sub - wavelength '' refers to the regime in which the period of the crystal is smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation traveling inside the crystal .",
    "many recent investigations into the behavior of meta - materials focus on phenomena associated with the _ quasi - static limit _ in which the ratio of the period cell size to wavelength tends to zero .",
    "sub - wavelength micro - structured composites are known to exhibit effective electromagnetic properties that are not available in naturally - occurring materials .",
    "investigations over the past decade have explored a variety of meta - materials , including arrays of micro - resonators , wires , high - contrast dielectrics , and plasmonic components .",
    "the first two , especially in combination , have been shown to give rise to unconventional bulk electromagnetic response at microwave frequencies ( smith _ et al . _ 2000 ; pendry _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; pendry _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and , more recently , at optical frequencies povinelli ( 2009 ) , including negative effective dielectric permittivity and/or negative effective magnetic permittivity .",
    "an essential ingredient in creating this response are local resonances contained within each period due to extreme properties , such as high conductivity and capacitance in split - ring resonators pendry _",
    "( 1999 ) .    in the case of plasmonic crystals ,",
    "the dielectric permittivity @xmath6 of the inclusions is frequency dependent and negative for frequencies below the plasma frequency  @xmath7 , @xmath8 shvets & urzhumov ( 2004 , 2005 ) have investigated plasmonic crystals in which @xmath7 is inversely proportional to the period of the crystal and for which both inclusion and host materials have unit magnetic permeability .",
    "they have proposed that simultaneous negative values for both an effective @xmath9 and @xmath10 arise at sub - wavelength frequencies that are quite far from the quasi - static limit , that is , @xmath11 is not very small , where @xmath2 is the period of the crystal , @xmath1 is the norm of the bloch wavevector and @xmath3 is the wavelength . in this work ,",
    "we present rigorous analysis of this type of plasmonic crystal by establishing the existence of convergent power series in @xmath4 for the electromagnetic fields and the first branch of the associated dispersion relation .",
    "the effective permittivity and permeability defined according to pendry _",
    "( 1999 ) are shown to be positive for all @xmath4 within the radius of convergence @xmath12 , and , in this regime , _ the extreme property of the plasma produces no resonance in the effective permittivity or permeability .",
    "_ this regime is well distanced from the resonant regime investigated in shvets & urzhumov ( 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the analysis shows that the radii of convergence of the power series is at least @xmath13 , which is not too small , as shown in table [ radiustable ] , which contains values of @xmath13 for circular inclusions of various radii @xmath14 .",
