    "in the early 1990s , kontsevich @xcite defined the kontsevich invariant ( the universal finite - type invariant ) of knots by the integral on the configuration space of finite distinct points in @xmath0 .",
    "all rational - valued vassiliev invariants are recovered from the kontsevich invariant through weight systems .    in the late 1990s ,",
    "ohtsuki @xcite showed that one can consider an arithmetic expansion of the quantum @xmath1-invariant of rational homology spheres .",
    "the result of this expansion is called the perturbative @xmath1-invariant .",
    "ohtsuki @xcite also introduced integer - valued finite - type invariants of integral homology spheres .",
    "kricker and spence @xcite proved that the coefficients of the perturbative @xmath1-invariant are of finite - type . on the other hand ,",
    "the perturbative @xmath1-invariant was extended to the perturbative @xmath2-invariant for any simply connected simple lie group @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the quotient lie group of @xmath3 by its center . moreover , using the kontsevich invariant , le , murakami and ohtsuki @xcite introduced the lmo invariant of connected oriented closed 3-manifolds .",
    "it is known that the lmo invariant is universal among perturbative invariants of rational homology spheres .",
    "bar - natan , garoufalidis , rozansky and thurston @xcite gave an alternative construction of the lmo invariant of rational homology spheres by introducing the rhus integral that is also called the formal gaussian integral .",
    "in these papers , it is suggested that the rhus integral can be extended to an invariant of tangles in a rational homology sphere , which is called the kontsevich - lmo invariant in @xcite and @xcite . using the kontsevich - lmo invariant , cheptea , habiro and",
    "massuyeau @xcite defined the lmo functor as a functorial extension of the lmo invariant .",

    "one of the advantage of the lmo functor is that we can use its functoriality to calculate its values and to prove its properties .",
    "the lmo functor is defined for a connected , oriented , compact 3-manifold regarded as a certain cobordism between two surfaces . here",
    ", these surfaces are assumed to be with at most one boundary component .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct an extension of the lmo functor to the case of _ any _ number of boundary components ( compare two figures in figure  [ fig : oldnewcob ] ) .",
    "it is expected that this extension enables us to introduce many _ categorical _ operations on cobordisms , for instance , which corresponds to the pairing or shelling product defined in @xcite .",

    "there is a tensor - preserving functor @xmath9 between two monoidal categories , which is an extension of the lmo functor .    a generating set of @xmath7 as a monoidal category",
    "is determined in proposition  [ prop : gen ] and the values on them are listed in table  [ tab : value ] . therefore , the functoriality and tensor - preservingness of @xmath10 enable us to compute the value on a lagrangian @xmath8-cobordism by decomposing it into the generators .",
    "it should be emphasized that there are diagrams colored by both @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 in table  [ tab : value ] , which implies that our extension is non - trivial .",
    "habiro @xcite and goussarov @xcite introduced claspers and clovers respectively that play a crucial role in a theory of finite - type invariants of arbitrary 3-manifolds . in @xcite , using claspers , it was shown that the lmo functor is universal among rational - valued finite - type invariants .",
    "we prove that our lmo functor @xmath10 has the same property .",
    "@xmath10 is universal among rational - valued finite - type invariants .    in @xcite , milnor defined an invariant of links , which is called the milnor @xmath14-invariant .",
    "habegger and lin @xcite showed that this invariant is essentially an invariant of string links . in @xcite , it was proven that the tree reduction of the lmo functor is related to milnor invariants of string links . by extending the milnor - johnson correspondence ( see , for example , @xcite ) suitably ,",
    "we show that the same is true for @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a string link in an integral homology sphere @xmath16 .",
    "then the first non - trivial term of @xmath17 is determined by the first non - vanishing milnor invariant of @xmath15 , and vice versa .    finally , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , one can find related researches from different points of view from this paper .      in section  [ sec : cobbttangle ] ,",
    "we define cobordisms and bottom - top tangles that are main object in this paper .",
    "section  [ sec : jacobidiagop ] is devoted to reviewing jacobi diagrams and the formal gaussian integral . in section  [ sec : kontsevichlmoinv ] , the kontsevich - lmo invariant of tangles in a homology cube is explained , which plays a key role in the subsequent sections .",

    "these values will be used later .",
    "section  [ sec : universal ] is devoted to reviewing clasper calculus and proving the universality among finite - type invariants .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : knot ] , we apply our lmo functor @xmath10 to some cobordisms arising from knots or string links .",
    "in particular , the relationship between @xmath10 and milnor invariants of string links will be discussed .      throughout this paper , we denote by @xmath19 the homology groups of a topological space @xmath20 with coefficients in @xmath21 .",

    "then , the composition of @xmath20 and @xmath27 is always defined by stacking the bottom of @xmath27 on the top of @xmath20 .",
