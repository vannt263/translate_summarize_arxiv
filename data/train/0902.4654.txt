    "in a recent series of papers we obtained exact solutions of the einstein equations describing both neutral and charged black holes free of curvature singularities in the origin @xcite .",
    "we reached these conclusions after a long path starting from an original approach to noncommutative geometry which is based on coordinate coherent states @xcite , in alternative to the mathematically correct , but physically hard to implement , `` star - product '' formulation .",
    "+ however , our results are `` model - independent '' in the sense that our approach improve the short - distance behaviour of the einstein equations by taking into account the presence of a quantum gravity induced minimal length , whatever it is .",
    "string theory , noncommutative geometry , generalized uncertainty principle , etc .",
    ", all point out the existence of a lower bound to distance measurements .",
    "thus , the very concept of `` point - like '' particle becomes physically meaningless and must be replaced with its best approximation consistent with the tenets of quantum mechanics , i.e. a minimal width gaussian distribution of mass / energy . solving the einstein equations for a static , minimal width , mass - energy distribution centered around the origin",
    ", we found black hole type solution smoothly interpolating between desitter spacetime at short distance and schwarzschild geometry at large distance .",
    "the characteristic length scale of this system is given by the matter distribution width @xmath0 .",
    "+ the geometric and thermodynamics features of the solution can be summarized as follows : + i ) there is no curvature singularity in @xmath1 ; the center of the black hole is a regular `` ball '' of desitter vacuum accounting for the short - distance quantum fluctuations of the spacetime manifold , whatever is their physical origin ; + ii ) even in the neutral case , there exist an outer and an inner horizon . at the end of the hawking evaporation the two horizons coalesce into a single , degenerate horizon , corresponding to an extremal black hole ; + iii ) the hawking temperature reaches a finite maximum value and the drops down to zero in the extremal configuration . +",
    "to achieve this regular behaviour the choice of the matter equation of state is instrumental .",
    "stability of the solution is guaranteed by choosing    @xmath2    where , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the gaussian matter density and radial pressure , respectively . the tangential pressure @xmath5",
    "was determined by @xmath6 and @xmath7 through hydrodynamic equilibrium equation",
    ". the condition ( [ vacuum ] ) has the same form of the vacuum equation of state .",
    "thus , one can expect that near the origin the metric will be desitter with an effective cosmological constant @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the width of the matter distribution is @xmath0 , at large distance one sees a small sphere of matter with radius about @xmath0 .",
    "thus , birkhoff theorem assures the metric to be schwarzschild .",
    "in the intermediate region the metric is neither desitter , nor schwarzschild , and can be analytically written in terms of lower incomplete gamma function .    in this paper",
    "we are going to relax equation ( [ vacuum ] ) and look for a new solution describing a dirty black hole .",
    "the starting point is the minimal width , gaussian , mass / energy distribution    @xmath9    which we obtained from our coordinate coherent states approach to noncommutative geometry . from this perspective",
    "the @xmath10 parameter is a length squared quantity defining the scale where spacetime coordinates become non - commuting ( quantum ) objects .",
    "however , in a more general framework the distribution ( [ gdistr ] ) represents the most localized energy density which is compatible with the existence of a minimal length , whatever it is .",
    "thus , the width of the bell - shaped function ( [ gdistr ] ) can be consistently related to the string length @xmath11 , the tev quantum gravity scale , etc . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "a gaussian source has been used to model phantom energy supported wormholes .",
    "+ the constant @xmath12 is the total mass energy given by    @xmath13    the mass distribution ( [ gdistr ] ) is the component @xmath14 of the energy momentum tensor . before proceeding we have to define the remaining components .",
    "we model our source through a fluid - type @xmath15 of the following form :    @xmath16    where , @xmath17 is the _ radial _ pressure and @xmath18 the _ tangential _ pressure .",
    "+ in order to be a viable source for the einstein equations , the condition @xmath19 must be satisfied by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "we are going to solve einstein equations assuming the metric to be spherically symmetric , static , asymptotically flat .",
    "thus , we can write the general form of the line element in terms of two independent functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the _ shape function _ and @xmath27 is the _ red - shift function _ @xcite .",
    "both unknown functions must be determined by the einstein equations . to this purpose",
    ", we now briefly recall a recent solution one obtains by assuming in place of ( [ vacuum ] ) the condition    @xmath28    where    @xmath29    thus , the resulting line element reads    @xmath30    which describes a wormhole geometry .",
    "its properties have been recently investigated in @xcite and we are not going to repeat them here .",
    "we have recalled this wormhole solution since it turns out to be useful to understand the procedure we shall follow in the next section . indeed to derive the dirty black hole solution , we are going to relax the condition ( [ eqstato ] ) in favor of a more general one motivated by physical requirements .",
    "the term `` dirty black holes '' refers to black hole solutions of the einstein equations in interaction with various kind of matter fields , some remarkable examples are :    * gravity + electromagnetism + dilaton @xcite ; * gravity + electromagnetism + axion @xcite ; * gravity + electromagnetism + abelian higgs field @xcite ; * gravity + electromagnetism + dilaton+ axion @xcite ; * gravity + non - abelian gauge fields @xcite ; * gravity + axion + non - abelian gauge fields @xcite ;    in our model we do not select any specific kind of field theory , but we simply introduce a smeared energy / pressure distribution , which is a classical parametrization for the energy / pressure `` stored '' in some kind of field .",
    "however , the condition which provides the relation between energy and radial pressure is crucial to determine the new solution . among the huge variety of possible choices of this condition",
    ", we require that the pressures @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy the following physical conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 must be asymptotically vanishing ; [ uno ] 2 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 must be finite at the horizon(s);[due ] 3 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 must be finite at the origin.[tre ]    the condition [ uno ] .",
    "assures that the solution matches the minkowski space at infinity while the conditions [ due ] . and [ tre ] .",
    "warrant the regularity at the horizon(s ) and at the origin , a fact that is in the spirit of all the previous solutions generated by a smeared source term .",
    "the line element we are looking for is of the form :    @xmath31    which can be obtained form ( [ metric ] ) by the following local rescaling of the red - shift function @xmath32 .",
    "therefore the einstein equation read    @xmath33    where , @xmath34 .",
    "+ according to the recipes [ uno ] .",
    ", [ due ] and [ tre ] , pressures regularity requirements are satisfied by the following condition replacing the ( [ eqstato ] )    @xmath35    that can be rewritten as    @xmath36 . \\label{steqn2}\\ ] ]    this is the simplest choice , satisfying the physical conditions above . in principle",
    ", one can still consider further conditions , involving additional terms @xmath37 in the square brackets on the r.h.s .. in such a case , one ends up with a more complicated solution , endowed only with subleading contributions to the solution we are going to derive , in the three physically meaningful regions ( infinity , horizon(s ) and origin ) .    from ( [ eq33 ] )",
    "one finds that the angular pressure @xmath22 is    @xmath38    we notice that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 enjoy the above physical conditions at the origin , horizon(s ) and asymptotically . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ steqn2 ] ) one has    @xmath39    with the boundary condition @xmath40 in order to reproduce minkowski geometry at infinity .",
    "the solution reads    @xmath41    where , for the sake of clarity we momentarily re - introduced the newton constant @xmath42 .    as a result",
    "the noncommutative schwarzschild `` dirty '' black hole is described by the following line element    @xmath43}\\left(1 - 2 g m(r)/r\\right ) \\",

    "thus , we find    @xmath46    which is the ricci scalar for a desitter metric characterized by a positive effective cosmological constant @xmath47 .",
    "the same conclusion can be obtained by expanding the line element near @xmath1 :    @xmath48    where , the constant @xmath49 can be reabsorbed into a rescaled time coordinate in order to have the ordinary desitter line element .",
    "also in the case of the dirty black hole there is no curvature singularity and the central black hole geometry results to be a desitter spacetime .    regarding the horizon(s ) , we have to study the equation @xmath50 where the `` effective potential '' @xmath51 is defined to be    @xmath52    for a positive given value of @xmath12 , the ( [ eqhor ] ) can admit two , one , or no solution .",
    "we studied in detail the solutions of this equation in @xcite and we are not going to repeat all the discussion here",
    ". it may be useful to summarize the main conclusion , i.e. the existence of a lower bound for a black hole mass given by @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we find again three possible cases :    * @xmath54 non - extremal dirty black hole with two horizons @xmath55 ; the outer horizon @xmath56 is said to be of _ canonical type _ , while the @xmath57 is a cauchy horizon .",
    "* @xmath58 extremal dirty black hole with one degenerate horizon @xmath59 ; the function @xmath60 does not change sign at the horizon , which is said to be of _ non - canonical type_. * @xmath61 dirty minigravastar , no horizons .    the asymptotic redshift @xmath62 versus the radius @xmath63 . on the right part of the figure , the curves are for the mass @xmath64 , while on the left are for @xmath58 .",
    "the dashed curves corresponds to schwarzschild case , while the solid ones are for the noncommutative schwarzschild ( thin ) and the noncommutative dirty case ( thick ) .",
    "we can observe that , for @xmath64 all the curves coincide and we can conclude that noncommutative effects are not yet important , while for smaller masses in the vicinity of the extremal configuration the curves become distinct .",
    "we can conclude that the shape function @xmath65 lowers the redshif , as in the case of a smaller gravitational field , while the redshif function @xmath66 slightly increases the values of @xmath67 . , width=321 ]     the asymptotic redshift @xmath62 versus the radius @xmath63 for the minigravastar case , i.e. @xmath68 .",
    "the dashed curve correspond to the schwarzschild line element and exhibit a divergent behavior due to the presence of horizons .",
    "the thin solid curve corresponds to the noncommutative schwarzschild case , while the thick solid curve is for the noncommutative dirty case . as a general prescription ,",
    "the shape function @xmath65 provides a regular peak at @xmath69 , while the redshif function @xmath66 slightly increases the values of @xmath67 with respect the noncommutative schwarzshild case for all @xmath70.,width=321 ]    an interesting feature of the above line element regards the gravitational redshift @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation at the source and @xmath73 is the difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths .",
    "this quantity now depends both on the redshift function @xmath66 and the shape function @xmath65 .",
    "the redshift measured by an asymptotic observer turns out to be    @xmath74    which is a clearly divergent quantity approaching the horizon , while asymptotically vanishes . on the other hand , in the absence of horizons",
    "i.e. the minigravastar case , the redshift @xmath67 is finite even at the origin .    the energy conditions for @xmath75 versus @xmath63 .",
    "the thick solid curve is for the functions @xmath76 , while the thin one corresponds to the function @xmath77 , which vanishes at the horizons .",
    "the violation of the weak energy condition occurs when either one of the solid curves have negative values .",
    "the dashed curve is the function @xmath78 , whose negative values take place where the strong energy condition is violated.,width=321 ]    in the framework of `` wormhole engineering '' exotic matter is advocated in order to violate energy conditions and avoid the tunnel to collapse . thus , weak ( wec ) and/or strong energy ( sec ) conditions violation are an important issue to discuss in the black hole case , as well . indeed , an eventual violation would mark a substantial departure from the behaviour of any kind of classical matter .",
    "this is what we expect as the gaussian distribution , which is the corner stone of our approach and was originally derived in @xcite in a _ quantum _ framework .",
    "the figure ( [ wsec ] ) shows the new features of the dirty black hole .",
    "+ let us start from the dashed curve representing the plot of the function @xmath78 . where it is negative ,",
    "the sec is violated .",
    "this occurs well for @xmath79 , which is well inside the event horizon located at @xmath80 , as in the case of the `` clean '' noncommutative geometry inspired schwarzschild black hole .",
    "both in the case of dirty and clean solutions , the sec is a short - distance effect caused by the underlying non - commutative geometry .",
    "spacetime fluctuations provide an effective gravitational repulsion smearing out the classical curvature singularity . on the other hand ,",
    "outside the black hole matter behaves in a ``  classical  '' manner .",
    "however , the memory of the short - distance effects is still present in the black hole temperature as it will be shown below .",
    "the new distinctive feature of the dirty black hole is that wec are violated as well , while in the clean case they are preserved .",
    "violation occurs , once again , inside the horizon and more specifically where the two solid curves in figure ( [ wsec ] ) lower below the r - axis .",
    "the presence of some `` dirt '' on the event horizon causes a suppression of the hawking temperature with respect to the corresponding clean case , in agreement with the general result shown in .     the hawking temperature @xmath81 versus the horizon radius @xmath56 .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to schwarzschild temperature , while from top to bottom the solid curves are for the noncommutative schwarzschild ( thin ) and the noncommutative dirty case ( thick ) .",
    "we can observe that , while the temperature decreases for the dirty case , the remnant radius is unchanged.,width=321 ]    the hawking temperature , mentioned above , is given by ( @xmath82 ) :    @xmath83 \\ , \\\\ & & \\phi\\left(\\ , r_+\\,\\right)\\equiv \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi } r_+}{8\\sqrt\\theta \\gamma\\left(\\,3/2\\ , r^2_+/4\\theta\\,\\right ) } \\left(\\ , \\frac{2}{\\sqrt\\pi } \\gamma\\left(\\,3/2\\ , r^2_+/4\\theta\\,\\right)-1\\,\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath81 is defined for any @xmath84 .",
    "the profile of @xmath85 resembles that found in @xcite and implies a `` scram phase '' at the terminal phase of the evaporation , namely a cooling down to an asymptotic absolute zero configuration .",
    "the correction due to the prefactor @xmath86 plays a non - trivial role only near the peak of the temperature by lowering of the maximum value , as it can be seen in figure ( [ temp ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the choice of the equation ( [ steqn ] ) and the consequent violations of wec in a region inside the event horizon @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "+ once the hawking temperature is known let us look at the area / entropy law . from the first law of black hole thermodynamics ,",
    "i.e. @xmath87 , we can write the infinitesimal entropy variation @xmath88 in terms of the effective potential @xmath89 :    @xmath90    in order to integrate ( [ ds ] ) in the correct way , we must take into account that the extremal , zero temperature , black hole configuration has zero thermodynamical entropy .",
    "thus , the integration range starts from the radius @xmath91 of the degenerate horizon , and runs up to a generic radius @xmath92 . with this choice of the integration range",
    "we find    @xmath93-\\delta s \\label{entropia}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath94\\ ] ] the first term in ( [ entropia ] ) differs from the corresponding quantity in the clean case only for the presence of the exponential factors . on the other hand ,",
    "the correction @xmath95 is characteristic of the dirty black hole , and vanishes in the large distance limit .",
    "indeed , for @xmath96 we recover the classical area / entropy law @xmath97 at first glance , the reader could question why the celebrated bekenstein - hawking ( [ 1/4 ] ) results to be valid only asymptotically , and not for any value of @xmath56 .",
    "the key observation is that nowadays everybody is taking for granted that the classical entropy of any black hole `` is '' one forth of the area of event horizon , measured in planck units , up to eventual logarithmic corrections from unspecified quantum gravity effects .",
    "thus , nobody cares anymore to `` recover '' the area law from basic principles .",
    "rather , the main interest is to match the classical result with the statistical interpretation of entropy in terms of black hole quantum micro - states .",
    "we would like to notice that the consistency between the geometric and thermodynamical definition of the black hole entropy requires that in any case it must be possible to _ derive _ the area / entropy law _ from _ the first law ( [ ds ] ) , as we did above , and to assume _ a priori _ it is valid .",
    "it is a common feature of regular black holes to display a more complex relation between horizon area and entropy , rather than a simple proportionality law .",
    "this effect can be traced back , once again , to the presence of a minimal length or , equivalently , to the granular nature of the `` quantum '' spacetime .",
    "this effect , together with the existence of a finite leftover by the hawking process , hints to a possible resolution of the information paradox worth of a more in - depth investigation .",
    "in this paper we extended our previous investigation of black hole solutions of einstein equations with a gaussian source .",
    "gaussian distributions are widely used in physics and it is surprising that nobody considered before the gravitational effects of this kind of sources . from our vantage point , we used this distribution to model the physical effects of short - distance fluctuations of noncommutative coordinates . generally covariant divergence free condition on the energy - momentum tensor in the einstein equations allows various kind of physically acceptable conditions between the energy density and radial pressure . in our case",
    "the component @xmath98 is assigned and the other ones must be determined in a consistent way . after recalling the wormhole spacetime geometry of the type conjectured in @xcite , we investigated a new dirty black hole type solution .",
    "the novelty of this solution with respect to the corresponding `` clean '' case is displayed in figure ( [ wsec ] ) . while in the original noncommutative black hole",
    "@xcite only the strong energy condition is violated , in the dirty case weak energy conditions are broken as well .",
    "the former violation removes the curvature singularity in the origin , the latter decreases the hawking temperature in agreement with the general result by visser @xcite .",
    "if lhc will turn to be an effective black hole factory , all the regular objects we have investigated so far are expected to contribute to the cross section production .",
