    "an _ @xmath0-end catenoid _ is a complete immersed minimal surface of finite total curvature which has zero genus and @xmath0 catenoid ends . it is considered as a conformal immersion @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "jorge - meeks surfaces @xcite are typical ones .",
    "recently , new examples of @xmath0-end catenoids have been found by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they contain examples with dihedral or platonic symmetry groups .",
    "we also remark that for special classes of minimal surfaces with catenoid or flat ends , some systematic approach has been known ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in each end",
    "@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) of an @xmath0-end catenoid , the _ flux vector _ is defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a curve surrounding @xmath7 from the left and @xmath11 the conormal such that @xmath12 is positively oriented .",
    "each flux vector @xmath13 is proportional to the limit normal vector @xmath14 with respect to the end @xmath7 and the scalar @xmath15 is called the _ weight _ of the end @xmath7 .",
    "it is well known that the flux vectors satisfy a balancing \" condition so called the _ flux formula _ @xmath16 it should be remarked that @xmath17 may take a negative value .",
    "therefore , we consider an inverse problem of the flux formula as follows :    for given unit vectors @xmath18 in @xmath19 , and nonzero real numbers @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 , is there an @xmath0-end catenoid @xmath22 such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the weight at the end @xmath7 ?    we remark that kusner also proposed a similar question ( see @xcite ) . by the classification of barbanel  @xcite and lopez  @xcite",
    ", we can see that the answer for @xmath25 is yes \" except for the case when two of @xmath26 coincide . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the first author @xcite gave an explicit formula for existence of an @xmath0-end catenoid with prescribed flux when @xmath28 is conformally equivalent to the image of its gauss map @xmath29 .",
    "in this paper , we will generalize the formula in @xcite , and show some existence and non - existence results on the problem . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we get the following :    [ thm : a ] for any pair @xmath30 of unit vectors @xmath31 in @xmath32 and nonzero real numbers @xmath33 satisfying @xmath21 , there is an evenly branched @xmath0-end catenoid @xmath34 @xmath35 such that the induced metric is complete at the end @xmath7 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the weight at the end @xmath7 @xmath36 , if and only if there exist complex numbers @xmath37 satisfying the following conditions : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the stereographic projection , and we assume @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , the immersion @xmath42 has no branch points if and only if the resultant @xmath43 of the polynomials @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46defined by and @xmath47 does not vanish .",
    "we note here that the flux formula holds even if the surface allows branch points ( see remark  [ rmk:2 - 8 ] ) .    in the case when an @xmath0-end catenoid has the same symmetry as its flux data , the construction is reduced to a routine work by virtue of our theorem , and one can construct all of the known examples ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) and far more new examples ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we also remark here that an @xmath0-end catenoid does not always have the symmetry of its flux data .",
    "in fact , there exists a flux data @xmath30 such that any corresponding surface does not have the same symmetry as @xmath30 ( see example [ exa:3 - 7](iii ) ) .    on the other hand , for a certain flux data , there are no @xmath0-end catenoids realizing it . indeed , there are no @xmath0-end catenoids with the flux data @xmath30 satisfying one of the following conditions :    1 .",

    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 ; 4 .",
    "@xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the first condition is well - known , and the third condition follows from the genus zero case of the second compatibility condition in @xcite .",
    "the fourth condition is new .",
    "these four obstructions are easily obtained as a corollary of theorem  a.    it is interesting to observe that , when the equality @xmath55 holds in ( 3 ) above , @xmath0-end catenoids which allow the deformation described by lopez - ros  @xcite can be constructed ( see examples  [ exa:4 - 8],[exa:4 - 9 ] and [ exa:4 - 10 ] ) .    in spite of the above non - existence results , it seems that generic flux data are free of additional obstructions .",
    "we demonstrate it for @xmath2 , and get the following :    [ thm : c ] for almost all pair @xmath30 of unit vectors @xmath56 in @xmath32 and nonzero real numbers @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 , there is a ( non - branched ) @xmath3-end catenoid @xmath59 such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the weight at the end @xmath7 @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the gauss map of @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , the number of such @xmath42 is at most @xmath3 up to rigid motions in @xmath32 . in particular",
    ", there exist @xmath3-end catenoids with no symmetric properties .",
    "we remark here that @xmath2 is the smallest number such that @xmath0-end catenoids have various conformal structures and that there exist mutually non - congruent @xmath0-end catenoids with the same flux data .",
    "indeed , the upper estimate in the theorem above is sharp ( see example  [ exa:3 - 7 ] and figure  [ fig:4noid2 ] ) .    to prove the first part of theorem  [ thm : c ] , we give an explicit algorithm to construct @xmath3-end catenoids with the prescribed flux by reducing it to solve a certain algebraic equation of degree @xmath3 .",

    "so @xmath68 has exactly order @xmath83 at each end @xmath7 .",
    "therefore we have that @xmath91 by and , we have @xmath92    on the other hand , since @xmath66 has no pole at each end , any pole of @xmath66 must be a zero of @xmath68 by . in particular , the inequality @xmath93 holds . since the degree @xmath94 of gauss map",
