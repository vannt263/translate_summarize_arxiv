    "in @xcite , an object called _ the velocity tensor _",
    "@xmath0 was described .",
    "it comes from a generalization of the equation @xmath1 into a generally covariant form @xmath2 the two - dimensional matrix of the classical velocity tensor takes the form @xmath3 while in the relativistic case @xmath4 where @xmath5 is some arbitrary constant , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the tensorial description has an obvious advantage over a standard description since it does not use the notion of the proper time @xmath8 and therefore it allows a description of non - uniform motions and systems with an arbitrary number of material points .",
    "it also provides a cornerstone for formulating a generally covariant mechanics .",
    "however , the velocity tensor deals solely with kinematical issues . to make the tensor description complete we need to introduce another tensorial object called _ the momentum tensor _ @xmath9 . by means of this tensor",
    "it is possible to solve dynamical problems .",
    "in classical and relativistic mechanics the following formula holds true @xcite : @xmath10 the tensorial equivalent of eq .  (",
    "[ 6 ] ) is presumed to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the momentum tensor and @xmath13 is an influence of the exterior on a body .",
    "it should be stressed here that we do not assume _ a priori _ the relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "the choice of the form of the mixed tensor @xmath12 comes from the assumption that the momentum tensor should be some function of the velocity tensor .",
    "since the velocity tensor is a function of a classical velocity @xmath15 , the momentum tensor is @xmath16 .",
    "in general , the momentum tensor @xmath9 is represented by a square matrix @xmath17 where the elements @xmath9 are some functions of velocity @xmath15 variable with time . in order to determine them ,",
    "we make use of the transformation relation for a mixed tensor .",
    "passing from an inertial reference frame @xmath18 to an inertial system @xmath19 that moves with velocity @xmath20 relative to @xmath18 , the momentum tensor @xmath9 transforms in accordance with the following formula @xmath21 or in matrix notation @xmath22 assuming that @xmath23 is form - invariant , i.e.  @xmath24 , we arrive at a functional equation for @xmath23 in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the velocity of a material point in the system @xmath19 and @xmath15 is its velocity in @xmath18 .",
    "it is easy to prove @xcite that after some simple substitutions and rearrangements in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) we get the solution @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an arbitrary square matrix formed by constant elements .",
    "in this case we substitute in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) the galilean transformation in the form @xmath29 and hence we get @xmath30 where all elements @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ tp5 ] ) are constant . since the above equation is only time - dependent , eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) leads to the expression @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and therefore we get @xmath34 and @xmath35 hence , in order to reconstruct the classical newtonian equation of motion we have to assume that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is mass of a material point and @xmath38 is a classical newtonian force in a two - dimensional spacetime . the choice of the sign in eq .",
    "( [ tpphi ] ) results from considerations in higher dimensional spacetimes .",
    "it results from eqs .",
    "( [ tp5 ] ) , ( [ fi0 ] ) and ( [ fi1 ] ) that only the element @xmath39 takes part in dynamical processes since no other coefficient appears in eq .",
    "( [ fi0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the other elements may take arbitrary values and each specific choice among them will lead to the same dynamics . in particular , we may choose them in such way that the relation @xmath40 is satisfied . keeping in mind that @xmath41 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , we get that @xmath42 the fact that in the considered case @xmath43 leads to the general assumption that the component @xmath44 plays a key role in the dynamics , and the components @xmath45 are auxiliary quantities that provide the formalism covariance .      in the case of substituting into eq .",

    "( [ betarelstan ] ) and ( [ betarel5 ] ) are identical , i.e. : @xmath68 as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ betarel5 ] ) , the constant @xmath69 plays the role of a `` renormalization '' constant for @xmath70 , hence it can be discarded without losing the generality of considerations",
    ". then matrix ( [ tp7 ] ) takes the form @xmath71 matrix ( [ tp1stw2 ] ) can also be rewritten as @xmath72 where the second matrix on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tp1stw3 ] ) is constant in time .",

    "( [ tpsilarel ] ) and ( 21 ) turn into @xmath75 in order to compare it with the standard formalism of the special theory of relativity , let us recall that in the standard description the equation of motion is given by @xcite @xmath76 and therefore @xmath77 substituting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ tpsilarel2 ] ) we get @xmath78 this indicates that the assumption that @xmath79 in this formalism and the standard description is the same leads to the conclusion that for a force @xmath38 constant in time the component @xmath44 is not constant in time , and _",
    "vice versa_. however , the uniform motion ( @xmath80 ) in both formalisms occurs simultaneously .",
    "the non - trivial part of the matrix ( [ tp1stw3 ] ) can also be expressed by means of well - known relativistic quantities such as energy and momentum : @xmath81 therefore we get @xmath82    it should be highlighted here that  as was mentioned before  it is possible to choose a different special form of the relativistic velocity tensor matrix and  consequently  a different description of dynamics .",
    "for instance , by analogy with the non - relativistic solution , we can assume that the relation between the velocity tensor described by eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and the momentum tensor is given by eq .",
    "( [ pfv ] ) . hence in order to reproduce eq .",
    "( [ pfv ] ) the general form of the momentum tensor matrix ( [ tp7 ] ) has to be reduced to the matrix @xmath83 where  as we have shown for the non - relativistic case  the constant @xmath39 can be identified with mass @xmath37 of a material point .",
    "it is easy to observe that form ( [ p2rel ] ) is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ tp7 ] ) , where all coefficients with the exception of @xmath39 vanish .",
    "therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ tpsilarel ] ) and ( 21 ) can be written down as : @xmath84",
    "the aim of this paper was to introduce a new dynamical object called the momentum tensor as an analogue to the kinematical velocity tensor , and therefore to complete the tensorial description of classical and relativistic mechanics .",
    "calculations show that the choice of constants in the momentum tensor matrix results in different models of dynamics in the relativistic case .",
    "another important fact is that the naturally assumed relation between the tensors : @xmath85 is just one among many .",
    "further investigations will focus on verifying the other models .",
