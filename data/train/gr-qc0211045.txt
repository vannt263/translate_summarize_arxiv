    "in familiar settings , gravity has a tendency to slow the transfer of information from one place to another . the linearized version of this effect is known as the shapiro time delay and has been the subject of many precision tests of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the locally measured speed of light remains constant , but the curvature of spacetime nevertheless requires a signal travelling between two `` locations '' @xmath0 to take longer than would be required to signal between the corresponding locations in minkowski space .",
    "we are interested here in whether this delay can take the form of an _ advance _ , so that the curved spacetime is in some sense ` faster ' than minkowski space .",
    "several such senses have been used in the literature and we will introduce more below .",
    "this issue has a long history and allows for interesting speculations .",
    "the question is often asked whether a technologically advanced civilization might alter the spacetime geometry to take a form that is maximally convenient for their transportation and communication needs and what bounds exist in principle on their ability to do so .",
    "another motivation comes from cosmology , as any spacetime of use to such an advanced civilization might provide for what is in effect a ` variable speed of light cosmology ' @xcite within the context of traditional einstein - hilbert gravity .    of course",
    ", the einstein equations themselves impose no restrictions on the geometry as they merely relate curvature to the matter content of the universe .",
    "thus , any spacetime may be constructed so long as one includes a sufficiently exotic matter source .",
    "well known examples of spacetimes widely considered to be ` fast ' include those of alcubierre @xcite and krasnikov @xcite as well as wormhole solutions ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the negative mass schwarzschild solution also allows fast signaling .",
    "in fact , all known solutions which are readily agreed to be fast contain matter that violates the weak energy condition .",
    "this condition @xcite requires the stress - energy tensor to satisfy @xmath1 for any timelike vector is replaced by an arbitrary null vector @xmath2 .",
    "however , we consider only the stronger version based on timelike vectors . ]",
    "@xmath3 . in the absence of a negative cosmological constant ,",
    "forms of matter violating ( [ wec ] ) are widely believed not to exist , or at least to be severely limited by fundamental principles .",
    "see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a summary of the current understanding of the limitations on negative energy fluxes from quantum field theoretic effects and @xcite for some discussion of the relationship between the ` negative energies ' of stringy orientifolds and the weak energy condition .",
    "there are substantial theorems to the effect that fast travel is not possible without violating this energy condition .",
    "such theorems include the results of hawking @xcite on the formation of closed timelike curves and those of olum @xcite , visser , bassett , and liberati @xcite , and gao and wald @xcite which relate more directly to ` fast travel '",
    ". these theorems can be quite powerful and each involves a somewhat different concept of ` fast travel ' .",
    "visser , bassett , and liberati @xcite focus on a perturbative description about flat space .",
    "gao and wald essentially discuss signaling between points in various asymptotic regions .",
    "olum takes a different approach and derives a rather more abstract theorem showing that without violations of ( [ wec ] ) , a certain de - focusing property can not arise .",
    "this property is expected to be related to localized regions of fast travel , and in particular the idea that there is a ` fastest ' path to follow .",
    "however , only the perturbative results of @xcite provide actual bounds on signaling times between locations within the interior of a spacetime .",
    "there is thus a sizable gap in the literature in terms of what one might call ` concrete ' results referring to the interior of a spacetime in the non - perturbative context .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the basic difficulty is to find a setting in which one may ask a well - defined question .",
    "one would like to ask whether one spacetime is ` faster ' than another , but this would require some way to identify standard ` locations ' in the two spacetimes between which one wishes to travel .",
    "the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity is well - known to make such notions extremely difficult to define .",
    "we begin to fill this gap below by using the restricted context of spherically symmetric static spacetimes to ask well - defined questions . in section",
    "[ bound ] , we derive a non - perturbative version of @xcite within this context .",
    "roughly speaking , it states that in terms of the time @xmath4 measured by an observer at infinity , a signal between any two orbits @xmath0 of the killing field takes longer to travel than it would between the corresponding worldlines in minkowski space .",
    "because it refers to the time measured by an observer at infinity , this result has much of the ` asymptotic ' flavor discussed above .",
    "we therefore find it rather unsatisfying .",
    "to be precise : if an advanced civilization wished to send signals quickly in order to compete in some way against a neighboring civilization , this theorem would provide useful guidance .",
    "assuming spherically symmetry and a static spacetime , they should make their home as close to flat minkowski space as possible .",
    "but one might imagine that a fast signaling time was desired for other reasons .",
    "perhaps it is desired ( _ e.g. _ , for reasons of social coherence ) to exchange signals on a timescale that seems short to the participants involved ; _",
    "i.e. _ , as measured by the proper time along the orbits @xmath0 of the killing field ? one might imagine that organizations and individuals living in distant parts of the civilization wish to exchange goods or information without receiving undue delays ( such as waiting a year to receive a much desired letter or package ) due to limitations imposed by the speed of light .",
    "let us therefore suggest the following two questions to provide a framework for our discussion .",

    "question 1 is of intrinsic interest to an advanced civilization wishing to create a ` maximally convenient ' home .",
    "question 2 is of interest because it provides a setting in which , due to birkhoff s theorem . ]",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , one feels confident that the sphere being discussed is in some sense ` the same sphere ' regardless of how the interior is filled .",
    "it also acknowledges the constraint that , while the civilization may be able to modify there spacetime in the interior of their sphere , they may have less control over the exterior region of the spacetime .    note that in both cases we have required the dominant energy condition . recall that this condition consists of the weak energy condition together with the requirement that @xmath17 , if non - zero , should be a future directed timelike vector .",
    "we choose it here because it is the strongest of the usual energy conditions that is expected to hold for all reasonable forms of matter @xcite , unless one allows a negative cosmological constant .",
    "we will have more to say about the interplay between these questions and the choice of energy conditions in section [ disc ] .",
    "the theorem of section [ bound ] does provide some information of interest to both questions .",
    "for example , it gives a lower bound on the signaling time as measured in both question 1 ( in the spherically symmetric setting ) and question 2 , but it in no way guarantees that the bound can be saturated .",
    "because this information is incomplete , we are motivated to explore the issue further by considering several particular spacetimes in detail in section [ ex ] .",
    "while we are unable to answer either question 1 or question 2 in full , we identify features that may be of use in future investigations .",
    "in particular , we find that at least in regimes far from that containing a black hole one can come close to saturating the bound of section [ bound ] .",
    "in addition , it appears that the dominant energy condition is significantly more constraining than is the weak energy condition .",
    "these conclusions are discussed briefly in section [ disc ] .",
    "in this section we prove a theorem showing that , as viewed from infinity , static spherically symmetric spacetimes are never ` faster ' than minkowski space .",

    "we will make frequent use of a certain strategy to explore the linearized change in the travel time near each of our examples , so we present this method first in subsection [ lin ] .",
    "we then study three families of spacetimes in detail .",

    "let us begin with the simplest allowed spacetime : a flat region inside the sphere of radius @xmath80 and , in order to match a schwarzschild exterior as required by question 2 , a thin shell at @xmath65 as determined by the discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature across this surface .",

    "unfortunately , such a spacetime does match the boundary condition that @xmath102 for @xmath103 as required by question 2 .",
    "on the other hand , this discussion suggests that one might study the spacetime we call `` de sitter space in a bottle '' in which we take @xmath104 for @xmath81 but add a shell at @xmath65 to satisfy stress - energy conservation .",

    "this second ( positive ) term can be made negligible in comparison with the first ( negative ) term .",
    "we have therefore established the existence of small perturbations which preserve the positive energy conditions but reduce the travel time below that of the background `` ds in a bottle '' spacetime .",

    "perhaps the most interesting suggestion from our investigation is that imposing only the weak energy condition may allow much faster spacetimes . in particular , we found in section [ ds ] that we could construct spacetimes satisfying the weak energy condition which allowed signaling across our sphere in a proper time significantly faster than @xmath221 .",
    "for @xmath224 we found that while our signaling time was much larger than the bound of theorem 1 , it could be made arbitrarily short compared to the naive minkowski bound .",
    "most of the work to date has considered the ( null ) weak energy condition because it leads to powerful analysis techniques based on the raychaudhuri equation and focussing theorems . in our case , we saw that the weak energy condition led directly to our lemma and our theorem in section [ bound ] .",
    "one would expect that both of these results to generalize beyond the spherically symmetric context and to again require only the weak energy condition for their proof .",
    "on the other hand , realistic spacetimes should also satisfy the dominant energy condition .",

    "<S> in a static spacetime , the killing time can be used to measure the time required for signals or objects to propagate between two of its orbits . by further restricting to spherically symmetric cases , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains a natural association between these orbits and timelike lines in minkowski space . </S>",
    "<S> we prove a simple theorem to the effect that in any spacetime satisfying the weak energy condition the above signaling time is , in this sense , no faster than that for a corresponding signal in minkowski space . </S>",
    "<S> the theorem uses a normalization of killing time appropriate to an observer at infinity . </S>",
    "<S> we then begin an investigation of certain related but more local questions by studying particular families of spacetimes in detail . here </S>",
    "<S> we are also interested in restrictions imposed by the dominant energy condition . </S>",
    "<S> our examples suggest that signaling in spacetimes satisfying this stronger energy condition may be significantly slower than the fastest spacetimes satisfying only the weak energy condition . </S>"
