    "supernova ( sn ) 2008d attracted a good deal of attention because of its unusual observational characteristics .",
    "most outstandingly , the serendipitous detection of the x - ray transient ( xrt ) 080109 associated with the sn explosion , during the swift follow - up of sn  2007uy , another sn in the same galaxy , ngc  2770 @xcite",
    ". the optical counterpart of the xrt was revealed at the same position of the transient a few hours after , allowing to have unprecedented early coverage of the sn emission .",
    "initially the sn was classified as a broad - line type ic sn ( sn  ic ) @xcite based on the broad absorptions and lack of hydrogen and helium in the first spectrum .",
    "later on , however , the spectra revealed the presence of strong he i lines , which changed the classification to type ib @xcite .",
    "type ib sne , as well as type ic and the transitional type iib sne , are believed to be the result of the core collapse of massive stars ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) that have lost most or all of their hydrogen ( and often helium ) layers before the explosion . for that reason ,",
    "they are called `` stripped - envelope sne '' @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism by which the envelope is removed is not fully understood .",
    "strong winds of single massive progenitors ( @xmath6 @xmath5 ) , sudden eruptions and binary interaction have been proposed as possible explanations , with the binary origin being the most probable scenario . in all cases",
    "a wolf - rayet ( wr ) structure is expected before the explosion , although for sne  iib a thin h envelope is expected to remain before the explosion ( e.g. , see sn  1993j @xcite , and sn  2011dh @xcite ) .",
    "interest in these objects has recently grown due to its connection with long gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) . to date six sne",
    "have been associated with grb , one of which also showed xrt . in all of these cases a highly energetic type ic sn , also called `` hypernova '' was observed .",
    "note , however , that the term hypernova is more generally used , and refers to sne with high luminosity or unusually broad lines , independently of their association with grb .",
    "the origin of hypernovae is thought to be a rapidly rotating and accreting compact object @xcite , or a magnetar @xcite , which should produce relativistic outflows .",
    "the nature of the xrt associated with sn  2008d is controversial .",
    "some authors are in favor of the supernova shock - breakout origin @xcite , while others consider that the transient was caused by a mildly relativistic jet penetrating through the envelope of the progenitor star @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the xrt could represent a transition between the most energetic hypernovae and standard core - collapse sne .",
    "however , the presence of a grb or the radio detection of superluminal motions caused by a long - lived relativistic outflow were firmly ruled out for sn  2008d @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of confirmation of a thermal component for the xrt @xcite , and the strong evidence of an asymmetric explosion , possibly bipolar @xcite , leaves room for the mildly relativistic - jet scenario .    another interesting feature of of sn  2008d was its double - peaked optical light curves ( lc ) .",
    "the first peak occurred at @xmath7 1 day after the xrt , and was similar to that of sn  2006aj , which was connected with a grb @xcite .",
    "the second and main peak happened at @xmath7 20 days after the xrt , consistently with other sne  ib and ic , and its origin is related with the decay of radioactive material synthesized during the explosion . by modeling the emission around the main peak , explosion parameters of sn  2008d , such as ejecta mass ( @xmath8 ) , kinetic energy ( @xmath9 ) , and nickel mass ( @xmath10 ) were estimated in previous studies . using analytic models , @xcite found @xmath11 @xmath5 , and @xmath12 foe ( 1 foe = @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 ) .",
    "based on monte carlo simulations , @xcite suggested that @xmath15 @xmath5 , @xmath16 foe , and @xmath17 @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite ( t09 hereafter ) subsequently presented an exhaustive analysis of sn  2008d using a set of progenitor models and hydrodynamics / nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "they found a very good agreement with the lc and the spectra for a model with @xmath18 @xmath5 , @xmath19 foe , and @xmath20 @xmath5 .",
    "early uv / optical emission is expected to occur after the arrival of the shock wave at the surface of the progenitor ( shock break - out ) and before the re - brightening due to the decay of radioactive material .",
    "this emission is a consequence of the nearly adiabatic cooling due to the expansion of the outermost layers of the ejecta .",
    "the observations of the shock break - out and the following emission provide very valuable information about the structure of the star previous to the explosion .",
    "the duration of this early phase depends strongly on the size of the progenitor . for compact wolf - rayet stars , which are proposed progenitors of sne  ib and ic , a duration of a few days",
    "is expected .",
    "consequently , catching a sn during this phase is quite a challenge and only for a handful of objects has this been possible .",
    "naturally , the origin of the earliest part of the lc of sn  2008d has been associated in the literature to the adiabatic cooling of the outer layers of the ejecta @xcite . however , different authors arrived at different conclusions regarding the progenitor radius .",
    "some suggested a value of @xmath7 @xmath21 @xcite while others proposed a larger value of @xmath7 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "in all these cases the estimations were based on analytic models for the early emission .",
    "note that @xcite and t09 performed numerical simulations , but they did not attempt a hydrodynamical modeling of the early emission so as to help discriminate between both possibilities .    given the unique information about the progenitor structure that is provided by the early emission we have performed new hydrodynamical calculations for sn  2008d , focusing on this phase .",
    "surprisingly , we found that our hydrodynamical models are not consistent with the cooling - phase explanation given in the literature for this object .",
    "hydrodynamical models predict a much larger contrast between the luminosity minimum which occurs after the breakout , and the luminosity peak due to radioactive decay than what was observed for sn  2008d . this has also been noted recently by @xcite using a set of hydrodynamical and spectral calculations of sne  ib and ic .    here",
    "we present the first radiation - hydrodynamical models for the early emission of sn  2008d and propose an alternative explanation for this emission based on a double - peaked @xmath2ni distribution .",
    "the data and hydrodynamic code employed are described in   [ sec : datamodel ] .",
    "a comparison with previous hydrodynamical results is shown in   [ sec : ct09 ] . our proposed model for sn  2008d",
    "is presented in   [ sec : optimal ] . in   [ sec : discussion ] we compare our model with the analytic models used in the literature , and discuss alternative explanations for the early emission .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the bolometric lc ( lbol ) of sn  2008d was calculated by @xcite using @xmath23 broad - band photometry for @xmath24 days , referred to the onset of the xrt , i.e. , @xmath25 ( in what follows , all times will be referred to this moment ) .",
    "here we adopt the estimates of lbol from black - body fits to the broadband photometry , which according to @xcite are more accurate at early times than direct integration of the observed flux . at later times",
    "we include bolometric calculations provided by t09 ( see their appendix  1 ) using optical and near - infrared ( nir ) data obtained with the magnum telescope and the himalayan chandra telescope . also available in the literature",
    "are two earlier data points , one at @xmath26 days observed with the swift telescope in the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 filters @xcite , and another at @xmath30 days in the @xmath31 bands @xcite .",
    "the integrated flux for each of these observations was calculated respectively by the authors .",
    "here we adopt , for @xmath32 days , the sum of the luminosity in the @xmath31 bands , plus the contribution of the uv as estimated from the earlier swift observations .",
    "the uncertainty of this point was assumed to be the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties of both contributions .",
    "we denote this earliest point with a different symbol ( square ) in all figures where it is included in order to indicate its different origin .",
    "the distance and total reddening assumed in the calculations are @xmath33 mpc , and @xmath34 mag @xcite .",
    "the bolometric lc reveals a double - peaked shape that is also observed in the broad - band photometry @xcite .",
    "we assume throughout this paper that the earliest data point is confident and therefore the early peak shape of the lc is robust .",
    "the first peak occurred at about 1 day with a luminosity of @xmath35 erg s@xmath14 , and the second or main maximum happened at @xmath719 days with a luminosity of @xmath36 erg s@xmath14 , corresponding to @xmath37 mag .",
    "therefore , sn  2008d had a normal peak luminosity , and a rise time at the long end of the observed range for sne  ib and ic @xcite .",
    "the contrast of luminosity between the main peak and the dip that occurs before the re - brightening of the lc due to radioactive material is only of @xmath0 dex .",
    "apart from the bolometric lc , photospheric velocities and color temperatures are also compared with our models .",
    "we employ he - line and photospheric velocities derived from the spectral modeling by t09 , and color temperatures calculated by @xcite .",
    "synthetic lcs were calculated using the spherical , lagrangian , lte , hydrodynamical code described by @xcite ( bbh11 , hereafter ) .",
    "the code solves radiation transport in the flux - limited diffusion approximation , including @xmath38-ray transfer in gray approximation .",
    "any distribution of the radioactive material is allowed and the energy deposition due to radioactive decay is computed in each layer of the entire ejecta .",
    "the ionization structure is determined by solving the saha equation taking into account the most relevant elements in the progenitor structure .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity is calculated using opal tables ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the empirical relation used in t09 , which is based on electron scattering opacity as derived from the tops database @xcite , and including effects of lines .",
    "the explosion is simulated by injecting near the center of the object a certain amount of energy , in a thermal form , during a short interval .",
    "the code does not explicitly solve for the explosive nucleosynthesis produced during the shock propagation , but it implicitly takes this into consideration in the chemical composition assumed for our initial models .",
    "as pre - supernovae models , stellar evolution calculations of he stars by @xcite were adopted .",
    "t09 studied five different he star models with masses of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 16 @xmath5 , using a variety of explosion parameters ( see their table  1 ) .",
    "they found that the models with he mass of 6 and 8 @xmath5 ( he6 and he8 , respectively ) were most consistent with the spectra and lcs of sn  2008d .",
    "they derived a kinetic energy of @xmath39 erg , an ejecta mass of @xmath40 @xmath5 , a @xmath2ni mass of @xmath20 @xmath5 , and a compact - remnant mass in the range of @xmath41 @xmath5 .",
    "we have based the current analysis on the results of t09 , and so we calculated the hydrodynamics for these two optimal models ( he6 and he8 ) , which correspond to main - sequence masses of 20 and 25 @xmath5 , as derived from the @xmath42 relation of @xcite .",
    "the chemical abundance distribution left by the explosive nucleosynthesis is assumed as a pre - explosion condition ( see t09 for more details ) .",
    "one characteristic of these nucleosynthesis calculations in spherical symmetry is that @xmath2ni is confined in the innermost layers of the ejecta , which makes it very difficult to explain the timescale of the rising part of the lc normally observed for sne  ib and ic . instead",
    ", a more extensive mixing of @xmath2ni , associated to multi - dimensional effects , was used by t09 , and we also adopted it here ( see   [ sec : ct09 ] for more details ) . note that mixing of @xmath2ni to large radius of the ejecta of ccsne has been successfully produced in recent 3d numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite have claimed that all sne classified as ib require efficient mixing of @xmath2ni in the helium - rich layers .",
    "we present here our hydrodynamic calculations for sn  2008d using the he6 and he8 initial models . in   [ sec : ct09 ] we compare our results with those of t09 by focusing on the second peak of the bolometric lc ( @xmath43 days ) , which determines the global properties of the sn .",
    "the early emission is analyzed in   [ sec : optimal ] , where we present a model that consistently reproduces the the first and second peaks of the lc .      as it is well known , the shape of the lc depends on the explosion kinetic energy @xmath44 , the ejected mass @xmath8 , and the mass and distribution of @xmath2ni .",
    "analytic expressions for these dependencies were given by @xcite , where the width of the lc peak is @xmath45 @xmath46 , and the peak luminosity is @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to estimate explosion parameters by comparing models and observed bolometric lcs .",
    "however , various combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath44 can fit the lc , and spectra modeling is needed in order to break the degeneracy of the parameters .",
    "this type of analysis was done by t09 and they found a very good agreement between models and observations using the he6 and he8 initial models with the following explosion parameters : for he6 , @xmath48 foe , a cut mass of @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ; and for he8 , @xmath51 foe , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . a constant @xmath2ni distribution up to 7000 ( 9000 ) km s@xmath14 for model he6 ( he8 ) was assumed to account for the rise time to the main peak .",
    "we have used the code of bbh11 to calculate bolometric lcs and photospheric evolution for the same models ( he6 and he8 ) and explosion parameters as those of t09 . as opposed to t09",
    ", our calculations solve the hydrodynamics coupled to the radiative transfer , allowing us to model consistently the earliest phases of the sn evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc1 ] shows a comparison of our results with those of t09 , along with the observed bolometric lc of sn  2008d .",
    "the photospheric velocities are compared in figure  [ fig : velo ] where we include the he lines velocities as well as the photospheric velocity estimated from spectra modeling by t09 . from these figures",
    "we see that the agreement between both models is reasonable , considering the differences in the calculation methods .",
    "the lcs look remarkably similar for times @xmath54 days .",
    "it is not striking that the largest differences appear at the earliest epochs , since the code in bbh11 self - consistently calculates the shock wave propagation , the breakout and the later evolution , while in the calculations of t09 , the hydrodynamics and the radiative transport were computed with different codes , switching from one code to other when the homologous expansion was achieved .",
    "there is a small systematic difference between the photospheric velocities of both models .",
    "this is probably related to slight differences in the re - gridding of the initial model , which produces a small difference in the actual total mass of the progenitor ( of @xmath55 ) .",
    "beginfigure    ]    both our calculations and those of t09 provide very good matches to the observations around the main peak .",
    "note that model he8 is the one that best represents the bolometric lc , while model he6 gives a better fit to the velocities , specially the photospheric velocities .",
    "some intermediate model between these two seems to be the most plausible progenitor , as suggested in t09 .",
    "however , at times before 8 days , the models predict much lower luminosity than the observed one . as described in ",
    "[ sec : optimal ] , this can be overcome by including a small amount of @xmath2ni in the outermost layers of the ejecta .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : lc1 ] that the models presented in   [ sec : ct09 ] can not explain the first peak shown by the observations .",
    "the difference in luminosity between the hydrodynamical models and the observations at early times are larger than @xmath56 dex , which is much greater than any possible uncertainty related with the calculations and observations .",
    "the models predict a brightness contrast between the dip and the main peak that is larger than @xmath57 dex , while the observations show a contrast of only @xmath0 dex .",
    "although the early behavior of sn  2008d was attributed in the literature to the cooling of the outer envelope of the ejecta after being heated by the shock wave , our calculation suggests that this cooling happened very quickly , and in less than 1 day most of the energy deposited by the shock was degraded . therefore , unless we assume a different structure for the progenitor i.e . , lager radius and/or more massive external envelope , some source of extra energy in the outer layers of the ejecta is required in order to reproduce the first peak of the lc .",
    "here we study this possibility and leave the discussion of other alternatives for   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we artificially placed some @xmath2ni in the outer layers of the ejecta as the source of extra energy needed to explain the first peak .",
    "this material may have been carried by a jet - like phenomenon produced during an aspherical explosion .",
    "the presence of a jet was proposed by @xcite to explain the xrt associated with sn  2008d , as well as the broad - line appearance of the spectrum at @xmath58 days .",
    "the double - peaked oxygen lines detected in late spectra @xcite provide additional evidence of the asphericity during the explosion .",
    "a spectropolarimetry study of sn  2008d by @xcite suggest that a jet was produced but that it stalled in the c+o core .",
    "maund et  al .",
    "base this conclusion mainly on the observed low degree of line polarization .",
    "however , for this sn the @xmath59 7774 line is so weak that one can not expect any strong polarization associated with it .",
    "weak lines do not produce high polarization , as shown , for example , in @xcite .",
    "a double - peaked @xmath2ni distribution was previously suggested to model the double - peaked light curve of sn  2005bf @xcite .",
    "the presence of an unobserved jet in sn  2005bf was speculated as being responsible for the anomalous @xmath2ni distribution . despite the overall observational differences between sn  2005bf and sn  2008d",
    ", some similarities in the polarization properties of both objects were found @xcite that could indicate similarities in the explosion geometry .    in figure",
    "[ fig : model ] we show the bolometric lc for our model with @xmath2ni in the outer layers ( solid line ) compared with the observations .",
    "this `` optimal model '' is similar to the he8 model presented in   [ sec : ct09 ] ( dashed line in the figure ) but with an extra amount of @xmath60 of @xmath2ni in the outermost layers of the ejecta ( at @xmath61 km s@xmath14 ) added to explain the early emission at @xmath62 days .",
    "in addition , the optimal model has a slightly extended distribution of internal @xmath2ni up to @xmath710000 km s@xmath14 ( as compared with 9000 km s@xmath14 that was used in the model of t09 ) to improve the agreement with the data during the rise to the main peak . for clarity , in figure  [ fig : model ]",
    "we show two models that lack external @xmath2ni , with internal distributions up to 9000 and 10000 km s@xmath14 ( dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) . in the rest of this paper the model without external @xmath2ni",
    "will be the latter one and will be referred to as he8 .    the agreement between",
    "the optimal model and the observations is excellent .",
    "the assumption of external @xmath2ni allowed us to reproduce the first and second peaks consistently .",
    "the luminosity contrast between dip and main peak is now similar to that shown by the observations .    in order to obtain our optimal model ,",
    "several @xmath2ni distributions were explored . in figure",
    "[ fig : nidist ] we schematically show a double - peaked @xmath2ni distribution where the internal and external components were assumed to be step - like functions within some internal and external velocities .",
    "this distribution can be characterized with three parameters : the mass of external @xmath2ni , @xmath63 , the minimum velocity for the external @xmath2ni , @xmath64 , and the maximum velocity for the internal @xmath2ni , @xmath65 .",
    "the effect of the variation of these parameters on the early lc is shown in figure  [ fig : lcni ] .",
    "we see that ( 1 ) larger @xmath63 produces a more luminous first peak , ( 2 ) higher @xmath64 produces an earlier first peak , and ( 3 ) lower @xmath65 translates to deeper and later minimum , or later rise to the second peak .",
    "specifically , we have adopted the following values for our optimal model : @xmath66 , @xmath67 km s@xmath14 , and @xmath68 km s@xmath14 .",
    "ni distribution characterized by the following parameters : the mass of internal @xmath2ni , @xmath69 , the mass of external @xmath2ni , @xmath63 , the minimum velocity for the external @xmath2ni , @xmath64 and the maximum velocity for the internal @xmath2ni , @xmath65 . [ fig : nidist ] ]    although we do not provide a detailed calculation to account for the occurrence of such @xmath2ni distribution , it is remarkable that it allows us to obtain a very good fit to the observation and also to explore its effect on the early lc .",
    "we also explored the possibility of using smoother functions for the @xmath2ni distribution , but we found that they failed to reproduce the two peaks shown in the observations , and instead they tended to produce a plateau - like shape . given the large uncertainties in the early observations , we emphasize that the critical feature of our model is to have some @xmath2ni in the outer layers but not the exact amount and shape of its distribution .",
    "another important parameter to compare with the observations is the temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : teff ] shows the effective ( solid lines ) and color ( dashed lines ) temperatures for the optimal model ( red ) and the model without external @xmath2ni ( blue ) , compared with the observed color temperature of sn  2008d @xcite .",
    "the color temperature ( @xmath70 ) gives information about the continuum spectral energy distribution . to calculate @xmath70 from the models it is needed to know the layer in the ejecta where the spectrum is formed",
    "an approximate estimation of @xmath70 is given by the temperature at the `` thermalization '' depth @xcite , below which the gas and radiation field are in equilibrium .",
    "following @xcite , we calculated the `` thermalization '' depth as the layer where @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath72 is the optical depth for scattering and @xmath73 the optical depth for absorption determined using @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the rosseland mean opacity calculated with opal tables , and @xmath76 is the scattering opacity calculated by solving the saha equations .",
    "the effective temperature is defined as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the radial coordinate at the photosphere position defined as the layer where @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the radiative luminosity plus the luminosity of @xmath2ni decay deposited above the photosphere , we have solved the gamma - ray transfer which allow us to compute the actual deposition of energy of gamma - ray in the entire ejecta ( in particular , above the photosphere ) .",
    "such deposition can be appreciably lower than the total available radioactive energy release , specially when the envelope becomes very dilute . ] . from figure",
    "[ fig : teff ] we see , as expected , that the model without external @xmath2ni has higher color than effective temperature , but neither of them provides a satisfactory agreement with the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperatures of the optimal model compare acceptably well with the data , but unlike what is expected , the effective temperature is higher than the color temperature for @xmath81 day .",
    "this can be understood from our definition of the effective temperature , which includes the extra luminosity of @xmath2ni decay above the photosphere .    unlike luminosity and temperature ,",
    "the photospheric velocity is almost unaffected by the existence of external @xmath2ni .",
    "therefore , we do not present a comparison between the velocities of the optimal model and observations because this is essentially the same that we presented in ",
    "[ sec : ct09 ] and figure  [ fig : velo ] .",
    "one could expect that the presence of @xmath2ni and associated iron - group elements in the outer layers can introduce lines and increase the blanketing , thus affecting the observed spectrum .",
    "however , if the iron - rich material is confined to a small solid angle , as in the case of a jet , the effect will be diluted , as explained by @xcite .",
    "as our simulations are carried out in one dimension we do not have the ability of reproducing the actual structure of a jet - like distribution .",
    "nevertheless , in the proposed scenario only a small fraction of the mass is involved in the jet itself , thus not affecting the global explosion dynamics .",
    "the low level of _ continuum _ polarization found by @xcite indicates that departures from spherical symmetry should be small .",
    "this allows us to treat the problem approximately in spherical symmetry .",
    "calculations performed in higher dimensions are required to produce a self - consistent model that would allow to test the proposed jet and aspherical @xmath2ni distribution .",
    "in the literature , the early emission of the lc of sn  2008d was explained as a consequence of the cooling of the outer stellar envelope following the passage the shock through the star and its subsequent breakout .",
    "analytic models by @xcite ( w07 ) and @xcite ( cf08 ) were used in @xcite and @xcite to compare with the early data of sn  2008d .",
    "these models describe the emission of the outer layer of the ejecta assuming : ( 1 ) pre - explosion density @xmath82 , which is valid while the photosphere is in the outer shock - accelerated part of the ejecta as long as the mass above of the photosphere is less than 0.1 @xmath5 , ( 2 ) self - similar solution once the supernova reached the state of free expansion to determine the post breakout density and velocity , and ( 3 ) constant opacity .",
    "the luminosity was calculated in a different way in each model . while w07 did not take into account the radiative diffusion assuming a strictly adiabatic expansion , cf08 considered the motion of a diffusion wave through the ejecta .",
    "therefore these models are valid after free expansion is achieved and until more or less the onset of recombination , when the photosphere begins to recede into the ejecta .",
    "recently , @xcite ( rw11 ) improved the model of w07 by including the effect of recombination on the opacity .",
    "they also corrected a typographical error found in a coefficient of the equation ( 19 ) of w07 .",
    "the analytic models mentioned above provide expressions for the time evolution of the luminosity , photospheric radius and temperature as a function of ejecta mass ( @xmath8 ) , ejecta kinetic energy ( @xmath44 ) and progenitor radius ( @xmath83 ) , besides other parameters that depend on the structure of the progenitor .",
    "however , the dependence of luminosity and temperature on @xmath83 is stronger than on the other parameters .",
    "it is linear for the luminosity and @xmath84 for the temperature .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lca ] we show a comparison between our hydrodynamical calculations and the analytic predictions of cf08 and rw11 .",
    "three different hydrodynamical calculations are shown : the optimal model , the same model without external @xmath2ni , and a model with constant opacity equal to the electron - scattering opacity for pure helium , @xmath85 g @xmath86 .",
    "for the analytic models , the corrected expression for constant opacity from rw11 [ their equation ( 13 ) ] was used here instead of equation ( 19 ) of w07 .",
    "two sets of explosion parameters for models cf08 and rw11 are shown .",
    "first , we focus on the behavior of the analytic prediction with the same explosion parameters as in our hydrodynamic simulations ( i.e. , @xmath51 foe , @xmath87 @xmath5 , and @xmath88 )",
    ". the analytic models for compact stellar structures assume an initial density profile with index @xmath89 , which is similar to the shape of the initial structure from stellar evolution that we adopted for model he8 , as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : rho_radii ] .",
    "as the proportionality constant between @xmath90 and @xmath91 is not given in the analytic models , we have scaled the density of these models to match the value of the he8 model at @xmath92 @xmath5 inside the star , i.e. where the analytic models are valid .    from figure",
    "[ fig : lca ] it is clear that ( 1 ) the analytics models predict a higher luminosity than the hydrodynamic model without external @xmath2ni , but they are still not consistent with the observations , and ( 2 ) the slope of the analytic and hydro models are quite similar until @xmath93 d , when helium starts to recombine and the luminosity of the hydro model enters a nearly plateau phase for approximately five days . after that time , the heating by @xmath2ni produces a re - brightening of the lc .",
    "note that the presence of a post - breakout plateau for wolf - rayet progenitors of different radii and masses has recently been reported in simulations by @xcite . in agreement with our simulations",
    ", they found that the typical differences between the luminosity of the post - breakout plateau ( @xmath94 ) and the main peak are much larger than the observed value of @xmath95 dex for sn  2008d .",
    "our hydrodynamical models show that the hypothesis of constant opacity breaks at @xmath93 d , when he begins to recombine and the photosphere recedes into the ejecta .",
    "by @xmath96 d , the mass above of the photosphere is larger than @xmath92 @xmath5 and the assumptions of the analytical models are no longer valid .",
    "therefore , our simulations establish a limit of about @xmath97 days for the validity of the analytic expressions .",
    "this is in close concordance with the range of validity suggested by equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) of rw11 , which for the values of @xmath44 , @xmath8 and @xmath83 used here , give a range of up to @xmath98 days .",
    "note that for this range of time there are only two data points available , including the earliest point which seems not to follow the analytic predictions .",
    "this makes the conclusions derived from the analytic models more dubious .",
    "finally , as we noted before , there is a difference in luminosity between our models and the analytic models even for times earlier than @xmath56 day .",
    "the differences may be related with the density structure of the outermost layers of the ejecta used in each calculation .",
    "a direct comparison of initial density structures is not possible because the scale of the relation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 is not provided in the analytic calculations .",
    "we can however make a quantitative comparison of post - shock breakout density structures .",
    "for the analytic models , this has the form @xmath99 .",
    "equation  ( 1 ) of cf08 evaluated at @xmath100 foe , @xmath101 @xmath5 , and @xmath102 days gives @xmath103 g @xmath86 , where @xmath104 is expressed in @xmath105 cm s@xmath14 . for our density profile at @xmath106 days",
    "we find a similar exponent but a very different proportionality constant : @xmath107 g @xmath86 .",
    "this difference can be the reason for the discrepancy in luminosity between analytic and numerical models .",
    "the difference in density may occur because the calibration of the post - explosion density profile used in cf08 was based on previous hydrodynamical calculations applied to a blue supergiant structure , useful to model sn  1987a , instead of a wolf - rayet progenitor as required here .",
    "a larger value of the progenitor radius of 9 @xmath108 was suggested by cf08 in order to explain the xrt of sn  2008d as completely thermal emission . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found a similar radius by fitting the cf08 relations to the early data , and assuming @xmath109 foe and @xmath110 @xmath5 , as suggested by @xcite . in figure  [ fig : lca ] , we include the analytic models for these alternative physical parameters . in this case , the analytic models reproduce better the early luminosity with the exception of the earliest data point .",
    "the improvement in the fit of the analytic models with larger radius suggests that adopting progenitors with large radii in our hydrodynamical simulations may allow us to reproduce the early data _ without resourcing to external @xmath2ni_. we thus attached several envelopes in hydrostatic and thermodynamical equilibrium to the he - rich layer of our he8 model .",
    "the attached envelopes were integrated inward assuming a fixed stellar radius and varying the effective temperature and envelope mass so that the condition of continuity at the fitting point was achieved for mass , luminosity , pressure , and temperature .",
    "we also verified that the bottom of the envelope is cool enough to prevent nuclear reactions from developing in that region .",
    "this allowed us to generate a set of progenitors with radii of 9 , 20 , 50 and 100 @xmath111 .",
    "the resulting bolometric lcs are shown with thick lines in figure  [ fig : lcradi ] , where the other physical parameters are the same as previously adopted . from the figure it is clear that at @xmath112 days models with larger radii produce slower cooling of the outer layers and higher luminosity , though not as large as the one predicted by the analytical models .",
    "after that time , all models look remarkably similar .",
    "note that models start to converge at @xmath113 days when the analytic expressions become invalid .",
    "finally we see that even with a radius as large as 100 @xmath111 , we could not satisfactorily reproduce the early lc .",
    "the analysis above was performed using nearly mass - less envelopes ( @xmath114 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the initial density profiles as a function of radius for these models are shown with thick lines in figure  [ fig : rho_radii ] .",
    "the shape of the density in the outermost layers not to follow the one used for the analytical models .",
    "this is reflected in a different , smoother , dependence of the luminosity on the progenitor radius than the prediction of the analytic models .    alternatively , we calculated initial models with 9 @xmath111 but with a substantial modification of the initial density distribution with respect to the he8 model . specifically , we removed 4 , 5 and 6 @xmath5 of the original he8 model and attached new massive envelopes preserving the total mass ( 8 @xmath5 ) , out to a radius of 9 @xmath111 .",
    "these structures are shown in figure  [ fig : rho_mass ] as a function of mass . the mass - less envelope model for 9 @xmath111",
    "is also included for comparison .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcradi ] shows the lcs resulting from these models ( thin lines ) .",
    "the early observations can be reproduced reasonably well with these type of structures , excluding the earliest data point . in these cases , the shape of the density profile as a function of radius in the outermost layers ( thin lines in figure  [ fig : rho_radii ] ) are closer to the function assumed for the analytic models .",
    "this means that , without considering the earliest data point , models with the larger radius and a modified density structure than those predicted by stellar evolution calculations can give a reasonable explanation of the early lc of sn  2008d as the cooling expansion of the outer envelope",
    ". however , the massive - envelope models give a much poorer fit to the lc around the main peak , and they pose the additional problem of finding a physical explanation to justify a density profile that is different from those predicted by stellar evolution models .",
    "note that some variations in the assumed pre - explosion density profile can be caused by effects of rotation , which were not included in our initial models . nevertheless , the expected differences are much smaller than those needed to fit the early data of sn  2008d .",
    "it is important remark that recent binary stellar evolution calculation presented by @xcite predicted a larger progenitor radius than that of @xmath115 @xmath108 obtained for our he8 model based on single stellar evolution .",
    "however , the radius comprising 95% of the mass is less than 1 @xmath108 , with the exception of the models that contain some hydrogen for which this radius can be as large as 5 @xmath108 ( see table  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for sn  2008d ,",
    "the presence of a thin h envelope was firmly ruled out from spectroscopic analysis , e.g. t09 estimated a very low upper limit for the hydrogen mass fraction of @xmath116 @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the binary models are similar to our low - mass envelope models and are not consistent with the early observations of sn  2008d .",
    "this also becomes clear from the results presented by @xcite based on the binary models of @xcite .",
    "all the lcs presented by @xcite have a post - breakout luminosity that is much smaller than the one observed for sn  2008d , as noted by the authors and according also to our calculations .",
    "as we noted previously , @xcite also found that the observed luminosity of sn  2008d at early times was much larger than the one estimated by their models .",
    "their calculations were done with a different hydrodynamical code and evolutionary initial models , as compared with our study .",
    "they considered unlikely that light contamination from the host galaxy , or any light scattered by the csm or pre - sn mass loss could produce the large post - breakout luminosity .",
    "moreover , cf08 estimated that the mass - loss rate of the progenitor was too low for the csm to be optically thick .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that the large observed luminosity could be due to the collision of the sn ejecta with a companion star in a binary system .",
    "however , they did not perform any detailed test of this scenario . models that explain the early enhancement of the luminosity due to binary collision were proposed by @xcite .",
    "these models depend on several parameters , such as binary separation , mass of the ejecta , shock velocity and viewing angle .",
    "an analytic expression for the luminosity as a function of time for a viewing angle of 45@xmath117 is given in equation  ( 22 ) of @xcite , with a stronger dependence on the shock velocity and the binary separation ( @xmath118 ) than on the ejected mass and the electron opacity .",
    "the shock velocity for sn  2008d can be estimated from the ejecta mass and explosion energy , assuming that @xmath85 g @xmath86 for fully ionized electron - scattering of pure helium , and thus leaving @xmath118 as the only free parameter of the problem .",
    "figure  [ fig : lca ] shows an example of the binary collision model for a shock velocity derived using an explosion energy of @xmath119 foe and an ejecta mass of @xmath120 @xmath5 as adopted in this paper . for this set of parameters the orbital separation required to reproduce the early luminosity is @xmath121 .",
    "this value can be slightly increased to @xmath122 if we assume values of @xmath123 foe and @xmath124 appropriate for the he6 model ( see section  [ sec : ct09 ] ) .",
    "this very small constraint found for the binary separation may pose a problem for the binary collision scenario .",
    "note that the typical binary separation of galactic wolf - rayet stars is @xmath125 , with very few exceptions @xcite .",
    "the situation might be remedied by assuming smaller viewing angles ( see figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but since we have no way to test this scenario , we will consider it a less likely possibility .",
    "the early post - breakout emission of sn  2008d can not be explained as the cooling of the outer layers of a normal wolf - rayet star after the passage of the shock wave , as suggested in the literature .",
    "alternatively we have proposed a model which assumes a double - peaked @xmath2ni distribution to explain this early emission as an attractive solution to this problem .",
    "specifically , an amount of @xmath60 of @xmath2ni was located in the outermost layers of the ejecta with @xmath126 km s@xmath14although the exact amount and distribution is subject to some uncertainties inherent to the data and the model itself .",
    "the assumption of external @xmath2ni allowed us to reproduce very well both the early and late observations of sn  2008d .",
    "the presence of this high - velocity radioactive material may be caused by the formation of jets during the explosion .",
    "a multidimensional model would be required to confirm our suggestion in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "hydrodynamical models applied to wolf - rayet star predict a much larger contrast ( @xmath1 dex ) between the initial dip and the peak of the lc due to heating by @xmath2ni than what is observed for sn  2008d ( @xmath7 @xmath127 dex ) . only with a substantial modification of the initial density structure that is predicted by stellar evolution calculations and for a larger progenitor radius , 9 r@xmath128 , can the early emission be compatible with the cooling of the outer envelope . even in this case",
    "the earliest observed point is not reproduced by the shock - cooling model and a much worse fit to the lc around the main peak is obtained .",
    "in addition , some physical explanation for such substantial changes in the initial density is needed to consider this as a possibility .",
    "we also analyzed the possibility that the early emission was due to interaction of the ejecta with a binary companion .",
    "this was based on the analytic predictions for the luminosity given by @xcite .",
    "however , we found that the binary separation required to explain the early luminosity of sn  2008d is very small ( @xmath3 ) , which poses a serious conflict for this interpretation .",
    "furthermore , we note that only the double - peaked @xmath2ni model can reproduce the earliest observed data point as well as the rest of the lc .",
    "both the binary interaction model and the modified density structure predict a larger luminosity at the earliest observed epoch .    comparing our hydrodynamical models with the analytic models commonly adopted in the literature to reproduce the early emission ( e.g. ; cf08 and rw11 ) we found : ( 1 )",
    "the range of applicability of the analytic formula is very restricted .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath129 days after the explosion was found . in this range of time only two data points of sn  2008d are available .",
    "( 2 ) the analytic models were calibrated with structures that may not apply to wolf - rayet stars .",
    "this could be the reason for the very different value found for the proportionality constant of the relationship @xmath130 for the post - explosion density profile as compared with the one used in cf08 ( equation  1 ) .",
    "( 3 ) a modification of the radius of the star , as commonly applied for the analytic models , implies a different inner boundary condition for the density which can not represent any stellar evolutionary solution .",
    "therefore , conclusions based on these simple models should be taken with caution .",
    "the analysis presented here shows the relevance of the early emission in our understanding of the progenitor structure previous to the explosion .",
    "we expect that current sn searches of increasing cadence will frequently detect more ccsne in the early stages of their evolution",
    ". then it will be possible to test whether the early behavior of sn  2008d is a peculiar to it or if it is a common feature of some type of sne .",
