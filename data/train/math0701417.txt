    "systems of differential equations in both finite- and infinite - dimensional settings close to an ahb have been subject to intense research due to their dynamical complexity and importance in applications .",
    "the latter range from models in fluid dynamics @xcite to those in the life sciences , in particular , in computational neuroscience @xcite .",
    "when the proximity to the ahb coincides with certain global properties of the vector field , it may result in a very complex dynamics @xcite .",
    "the formation of the smale horseshoes in systems with a homoclinic orbit to a saddle - focus equilibrium provides one of the most representative examples of this type @xcite .",
    "canard explosion in relaxation systems affords another example @xcite .",
    "recent studies of relaxation systems , motivated mainly by applications in the life sciences , have revealed that the proximity to an ahb has a significant impact on the system dynamics .",
    "it manifests itself as a family of multimodal periodic solution that are composed of large - amplitude relaxation oscillations ( generated by the global structure of the vector field ) and small - amplitude nearly harmonic oscillations ( generated by the vector field near the equilibrium close to the ahb ) @xcite ( see figure [ f.1 ] ) .",
    "these families of solutions possess rich bifurcation structure .",
    "a remarkable example of an infinite - dimensional system close to the ahb has been recently studied by frankel and roytburd @xcite .",
    "they derived and systematically studied a model of solid fuel combustion in the form of a free boundary problem for a @xmath1 heat equation with nonlinear conditions imposed at the free boundary modeling the interface between solid fuel mixture and a solid product .",
    "the investigations of this model revealed a wealth of spatial - temporal patterns ranging from a uniform front propagation to periodic and aperiodic front oscillations .",
    "the transitions between different dynamical regimes involve a variety of nontrivial bifurcation phenomena including period - doubling cascades , period - adding sequences , and windows of chaotic dynamics . to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for different dynamical regimes and transitions between them , frankel and roytburd employed pseudo - spectral techniques to derive a finite - dimensional approximation for the interface dynamics in the free boundary problem @xcite . as shown in @xcite , a system of three ordinary differential equations captured the essential features of the bifurcation structure of the infinite - dimensional problem .",
    "the numerical bifurcation analysis of the finite - dimensional approximation revealed a rich family of multimodal periodic solutions similar to those reported in the context of relaxation systems near the ahb @xcite .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams presented in @xcite and in @xcite share a striking similarity , despite the absence of any apparent common structures in the underlying models ( except to the proximity to the ahb ) . in particular , in both models ,",
    "topologically distinct multimodal periodic solutions are located on isolas , closed curves in the parameter space .",
    "the methods of analysis of the mixed - mode solutions in @xcite used in an essential way the relaxation structure present in these problems .",
    "these approaches can not be applied directly to analyzing the model in @xcite , because it is not a priori clear what creates the separation of the time scales in this model , in spite of the evident fast - slow character of the numerical solutions .",
    "this is partly due to the spectral method , which was used to derive the system of equations in @xcite : while it has captured well the finite - dimensional attractor of the interface dynamics , it has disguised the structure of the physical model .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to identify the structure responsible for the generation of the multimodal oscillations in a finite - dimensional model for the interface dynamics and to relate it to those studied in the context of relaxation oscillations .",
    "the family of flows in @xcite includes in a natural way two types of the ahbs .",
    "depending on the parameter values , the equilibrium of the system of ordinary differential equations in @xcite undergoes either a sub- or a supercritical ahb .",
    "a similar situation is encountered in certain neuronal models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in either case , the global multimodal periodic solutions are created after the ahb . however , in the case of a supercritical bifurcation , they are preceded by a series of period - doubling bifurcations of small amplitude limit cycles , arising from the ahb . on the other hand , in the subcritical case",
    ", the ahb gives rise to multimodal solutions , whose lengths and time intervals between successive large amplitude oscillations can be very long . in the present paper",
    ", we perform a detailed asymptotic analysis of the trajectories in a class of systems motivated by the problem in @xcite .",
    "our analysis includes both cases of the sub- and supercritical ahbs .",
    "we also investigate the dynamical regimes arising near the border between the regions of sub- and supercritical ahb .",
    "this region in the parameter space contains a number of nontrivial oscillatory patterns including multimodal trajectories with substantial time intervals between successive spikes , irregular , and possibly chaotic oscillations , as well as a family of periodic orbits undergoing a cascade of period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "our analysis shows that these dynamical patterns and the order in which they appear under the variation of the control parameters are independent on the details of the model , but are characteristic to the transition from sub- to supercritical ahb .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . after introducing the model and rewriting it in the normal",
    "coordinates , we present a set of the numerical experiments to be explained in the remainder of the paper .",
    "then we state our results for each of the following cases : supercritical ahb , subcritical ahb , and the transition layer between the regions of sub- and supercritical ahb . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the local behavior of trajectories near a weakly unstable saddle - focus .",
    "the local expansions used in this section are similar to those used in @xcite for analyzing the ahb using the method of averaging .",
    "however , rather than establishing existence of periodic solutions , the goal of the present section is to approximate the trajectories near the saddle - focus .",
    "for this , after rescaling the variables and recasting the system into cylindrical coordinates , we reduce the system dynamics to a @xmath2 slow manifold . by integrating the leading order approximation of the reduced system ,",
    "we obtain necessary information about the local behavior of trajectories .",
    "the results of this section are summarized in theorem 3.1 . in section 4",
    ", we study oscillatory patterns generated by the class of systems under investigation .",
    "it is divided into three subsections devoted to the oscillations triggered by the supercritical ahb (  4.1 ) , subcritical ahb (  4.2 ) , and those found in the transition region between sub- and supercritical ahb (  4.3 ) . in the supercritical case ,",
    "we show that the oscillations just after the ahb are already bimodal .",
    "generically , one needs to use two harmonics to describe the limit cycle born at the supercritical ahb in @xmath0 .",
    "we give a geometric interpretation of this effect , which we call the frequency doubling , due to the fact that the second frequency is twice as large as that predicted by the hopf bifurcation theorem @xcite .",
    "we also compute the curvature and the torsion of the periodic orbit as a curve in @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is useful for the geometric explanation of the frequency doubling . in subsection 4.2 , we study the subcritical case . we show that under two general assumptions on the global vector field , the presence of the return mechanism ( * g1 * ) and the strong contraction property ( * g2 * ) , the subcritical ahb results in sustained multimodal oscillations . even though the oscillations may not be periodic ( our assumptions do not warrant periodicity ) , the time intervals between consecutive spikes of the resultant motion comply to the uniform bounds given in theorem 4.1",
    "this subsection also contains the definitions of the multimodal oscillations and the precise formulation of the assumptions on the global vector field .",
    "the proof of theorem 4.1 is relegated to section 5 .",
    "subsection 4.3 describes the transition between sub- and supercritical ahb .",
    "this transition contains a distinct bifurcation scenario , when a small positive real part of the complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues is positive and fixed and the first lyapunov coefficient changes sign .",
    "the numerical simulations show that this results in the formation of the chaotic attractor followed by the reverse period - doubling cascade . to explain this bifurcation sequence , we derive a @xmath1 first return map .",
    "the asymptotic analysis in this subsection is complemented by numerical extension of the map to the region inaccessible by local asymptotic expansions .",
    "the first return map obtained by the combination of the analytic and numerical techniques reveals the principal traits of the transition from sub- to supercritical ahb .",
    "finally , the discussion of the results of the present paper and their relation to the previous work is given in section 6 .",
    "in the present section , we formulate the model and present a set of numerical results , which motivated our study .",
    "the following system of three odes was derived in @xcite , as a finite - dimensional approximation for the interface dynamics in a free boundary problem modeling solid fuel combustion : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 approximates the velocity of the interface between the solid fuel and the burnt material .",
    "functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the first two coefficients in the series expansion for the spatial temperature profile with respect to the basis of chebyshev - laguerre polynomials . equations ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) are obtained by projecting the original infinite - dimensional problem onto a finite - dimensional function space and using the method of collocations for determining the unknown coefficients .",
    "an important ingredient of the model , nonlinear kinetic function @xmath7 is given by k(v)=(1-v)^p-(1-v)^-1p+1 .",
    "* a * + * c * + * e * + * g *    it reflects the dependence of the velocity of propagation on the temperature in the front .",
    "this relation is very complex and is not completely understood at present . to account for a range of possible kinetic mechanisms , the model includes two control parameters : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "both the interface velocity and the temperature profile are calculated in the uniformly moving frame of reference .",
    "therefore , system of equations ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) describes the deviations of the interface dynamics from that of a front traveling with constant speed .",
    "in particular , periodic and aperiodic oscillations generated by ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) correspond to complex spatio - temporal patterns in the infinite - dimensional model .",
    "the numerical results presented in @xcite show a remarkable similarity between the complex patterns generated by the infinite- and finite - dimensional models and between the scenarios for transitions between different regimes in both models . for more information about the derivation of the free - boundary problem for solid fuel combustion and its finite - dimensional approximation , we refer the reader to @xcite and bibliography therein .",
    "a simple inspection of ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) shows that it has an equilibrium at the origin @xmath10 for all values of @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "we linearize ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) about the equilibrium at the origin @xmath12 near @xmath13 , jacobian matrix @xmath14 has a negative eigenvalue @xmath15 and a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the latter crosses the imaginary axis transversally at @xmath18 : @xmath19 therefore , the equilibrium of ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) undergoes an ahb . in the neighborhood of @xmath20 , @xmath21 defines a smooth invertible function .",
    "we shall use @xmath22 as a new control parameter . after a linear coordinate transformation , system of equations ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] )",
    "has the following form : x = (    ccc -1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & & -b ( ) + 0 & b ( ) &    ) x + h(x , ) , x=(x_1 , x_2 , x_3)^t , h=(h_1 , h_2 , h_3)^t . here ,",
    "by @xmath23 we denote the imaginary part of @xmath24 as a function of the new control parameter .",
    "nonlinear function @xmath25 is a smooth function such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 for values of @xmath22 close to @xmath28 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath29 stands for a family of functions parametrized by @xmath9 ( see ( [ 6.4 ] ) ) . to keep the notation simple",
    ", we omit the dependence of @xmath29 on the second control parameter @xmath9 .    *",
    "a *    it turns out that in the range of parameters of interest , the ahb of the equilibrium for @xmath30 can be either subcritical , or supercritical , or degenerate depending on the value of @xmath9 .",
    "this gives rise to several qualitatively distinct oscillatory regimes generated by ( [ 6.5 ] ) for small values of @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding bifurcation scenarios for ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) for fixed values of @xmath9 and varying @xmath8 were studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "below , we reproduce some of these numerics for the system in new coordinates and supplement them with a set of new numerical experiments relevant to the analysis of this paper . after that we state our results for each of the following cases : supercritical ahb , subcritical ahb , and the transition layer between the regions of sub- and supercritical bifurcations .",
    "* a *    we start with discussing the supercitical case .",
    "it is well known that a supercritical ahb produces a stable periodic orbit in a small neighborhood of the bifurcating equilibrium .",
    "the period of the nascent orbit is approximately equal to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the imaginary part of the pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues of the matrix of the linearized system at the bifurcation .",
    "the numerical time series of @xmath34 and @xmath35 show that , while @xmath35 oscillate with the frequency prescribed by the andronov - hopf bifurcation theorem @xcite , the former oscillates with twice that frequency ( see figure [ f.1]a , b ) .",
    "the asymptotic analysis of section 3 explains this counter - intuitive effect and shows that this is , in fact , a generic property of the periodic orbits born from a supercritical bifurcation in @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "note that the difference in frequencies of oscillations in @xmath34 and @xmath35 can not be understood from the topological normal form from the ahb @xcite , because the latter does not contain the information about the geometry of the periodic orbit . in section 4.1",
    ", we compute two geometric invariants of the periodic orbits as a curve in @xmath0 : the curvature and the torsion . the latter shows that generically the orbit born from a supercritical ahb is not planar .",
    "this together with certain symmetry properties of the orbit explains the frequency doubling of the oscillations in @xmath34 .",
    "as was noted in @xcite , for increasing values of @xmath38 , the small periodic orbit born from the supercritical ahb undergoes a cascade of period - doubling bifurcations , the first of which is shown in figure [ f.1]c , d . already at the first period - doubling bifurcation ,",
    "the periodic orbit lies outside the region of validity of the local power series expansions , developed in the present paper .",
    "therefore , our analysis does not explain the period - doubling bifurcations for increasing values of @xmath39 .",
    "in section 4.3 we complement our analytical results with the numerical construction of the @xmath1 first return map .",
    "the latter explains the mechanism for period - doubling cascade and the window of complex dynamics reported in @xcite .    *",
    "a *    * a *    we next turn to the subcritical case .",
    "the dynamics resulting from the subcritical ahb depends on the properties of the vector field outside of a small neighborhood of the equilibrium .",
    "we conducted a series of numerical experiments to study the global properties of the vector field ( see caption of figure [ f.2 ] for details ) .",
    "based on these numerical observations , we identify two essential features of the vector field : * ( g1 ) * the return mechanism and * ( g2 ) * the strong contraction property . specifically ,    ( g1 ) : :    for a suitably chosen cylindrical crossection , @xmath40 ,    placed sufficiently close to the origin , and another crossection ,    @xmath41 , transverse to @xmath42 ( see figure    [ f.2]a ) , the flow - defined map @xmath43 is    well - defined for @xmath44 and depends smoothly on the    parameters of the system .",
    "( g2 ) : :    there is a region @xmath45 , adjacent to    @xmath41 and containing a subset of @xmath42    ( see figure [ f.2]a ) , in which the projection of the vector field in    direction transverse to @xmath42 is sufficiently stronger    than that in the tangential direction .    in section 4.2 , conditions",
    "* ( g1 ) * and * ( g2 ) * are made precise .",
    "properties * ( g1 ) * and * ( g2 ) * guarantee that for small values of @xmath39 , the trajectories leaving a small neighborhood of the saddle - focus , after some relatively short time enter @xmath45",
    ". in @xmath45 , the trajectories approach @xmath42 closely and then follow it to a sufficiently small neighborhood of the unstable equilibrium . for small @xmath39 ,",
    "the trajectories starting from a sufficiently small neighborhood of the saddle - focus , remain in some larger ( but still small ) neighborhood of the origin for a long time .",
    "eventually , they hit @xmath40 and the dynamics described above repeats .",
    "therefore , under conditions * ( g1 ) * and * ( g2 ) * , the subcritical ahb bifurcation results in a sustained motion consisting of long intervals of time that the trajectory spends near a weakly unstable saddle - focus and relatively brief excursions outside of a small neighborhood of the origin ( see figure [ f.2]a ) . in terms of the time series , the dynamical variables undergo series of small amplitude oscillations alternating with large spikes ( figure [ f.1]e - h ) . for increasing values of @xmath38 , the number of small amplitude oscillations decreases and so do the time intervals between consecutive spikes , so - called interspike intervals ( isis ) .",
    "the multimodal solutions arising near the subcritical ahb are not necessarily periodic .",
    "nonetheless , the isis may be characterized in terms of the control parameters present in the system , regardless of whether the underlying trajectories are periodic or not .",
    "specifically , in section 4.2 , we derive an asymptotic relation for the duration of the isis : ~12 ( 1 + ( p)o(^- ) ) , 4 , where the first lyapunov coefficient @xmath46 reflects the distance of the system from the transition from sub- to supercritical ahb , with @xmath46 being positive when the ahb is subcritical and equal to zero at the transition point . finally , @xmath47 is a small parameter and positive @xmath48 .",
    "the role of @xmath49 will become clear later .",
    "we illustrate ( [ 6.6 ] ) with numerically computed plots of the isis under the variation of control parameters in figure [ f.3 ] .",
    "the isis provide a convenient and important characteristics of the oscillatory patterns involving pronounced spikes .",
    "for example , it is widely used in both theoretical and experimental neuroscience for description of patterns of electric activity in neural cells .",
    "an important aspect of the isis , is that the dependence of the isis on the control parameters in the system ( which often can be directly established experimentally ) reveals the bifurcation structure of the system .",
    "therefore , the analytical characterization of the isis in terms of the bifurcation parameters , such as given in ( [ 6.6 ] ) , is important in applications .",
    "for the problem at hand , the isis depend on the interplay of the two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath46 , which reflect the proximity of the system to a codimension 2 bifurcation .",
    "the dependence of the isis on @xmath22 was studied in @xcite for a model problem near a hopf - homoclinic bifurcation .",
    "our analysis extends the formula for the isis obtained in @xcite to a wide class of systems and emphasizes the role of @xmath46 , which is important for the present problem .",
    "we also note that the structure of the global vector field suggests that ( [ 6.5 ] ) is also close to a homoclinic bifurcation , which can also influence the isis . however , under the variation of the control parameters @xmath22 and @xmath9 the system remains bounded away from the homoclinic bifurcation , so that the latter effectively does not affect the isis .",
    "in fact , ( [ 6.6 ] ) can be easily extended to include the distance from the homoclinic bifurcation as well . as follows from ( [ 6.6 ] ) , the isis increase for decreasing values of @xmath50 ( see figure [ f.3]b ) .",
    "this observation prompted our interest in investigating the transition in the system dynamics as @xmath51 crosses @xmath28 .",
    "numerical simulations show that as @xmath51 approaches @xmath28 from the positive side , the oscillations become very irregular and very likely to be chaotic ( figure [ f.4 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath52 is fixed and @xmath51 crosses 0 , the irregular dynamics is followed by the reverse period - doubling cascade and terminates with the creation of a regular small amplitude periodic orbit , which can be then tracked down to a nondegenerate supercritical ahb ( figure [ f.5]a - h ) .",
    "this scenario presents a certain interest as it suggests the formation of the chaotic attractor in a well - defined bifurcation setting .",
    "namely , the transition from the region of subcritical to supercritical ahb for small @xmath52 leads to the formation of a chaotic attractor and a reverse period - doubling cascade . as in the case of the complex dynamics appearing for increasing values of @xmath22 for supercritical ahb",
    ", the irregular oscillations in the present case can not be understood using the local analysis alone .",
    "therefore , we complemented our analysis with the study of numerically constructed first return map .",
    "the latter gives a clear geometric picture of the origins of the chaotic dynamics and the period - doubling cascade of periodic orbits in this parameter regime .",
    "in the present section , we study trajectories of ( [ 6.5 ] ) in a small neighborhood of the equilibrium at the origin .",
    "assume that @xmath53 is a smooth function in a small neighborhood of @xmath54 , so that all power series expansions below are justified .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of ( [ 6.5 ] ) for values of @xmath22 close to @xmath28 .",
    "the role of @xmath22 in our analysis is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath22 is a control parameter in this problem , on the other hand , the smallness of @xmath22 is used in the asymptotic analysis below . to separate these two roles , we use the following rescaling = ^2 , where @xmath47 is a fixed sufficiently small constant and @xmath55 varies in a certain interval of size @xmath56 .",
    "we introduce cylindrical coordinates in @xmath0 ( x_1,x_2,x_3)(x_1 , , ) ^+s^1,x_2=,x_3= , and define d=\\ { ( x_1 , , ): | x_1 | m^2 ^ 2 , ( 0,2 m ] } , d_0=\\ { ( x_1 , , ): |",
    "x_1     to characterize the trajectories of ( [ 6.5 ] ) in @xmath57 we will use an exponentially stable slow manifold , @xmath58 , whose leading order approximation is given by s_0= \\ { ( x_1 , , ) : x_1=u()^2 , 02 m } , where u()= a + a(2- ) . and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are computable constants ( see appendix a ) .    below",
    "we show that the trajectories of ( [ 6.5 ] ) with initial data from @xmath61 approach an @xmath62 neighborhood of @xmath63 in time @xmath64 and stay in this neighborhood as long as they remain in @xmath57 .",

    "further increase in @xmath51 , yields more period - doubling bifurcations ( figure [ f.5 ] c , d ) . given the unimodal character of @xmath242 , one expects that this sequence of period - doubling bifurcations eventually leads to the formation of a chaotic attractor ( figure [ f.5 ] a , b ) .",
    "the unimodal character of the map combined with the manner of its dependence on @xmath51 suggest a clear geometric mechanism for the formation of the chaotic attractor and the subsequent period - doubling cascade arising near the transition from sub- to supercritical ahb ( figure [ f.5]a - h ) .",
    "we now outline the limitations of the asymptotic analysis of this section and difficulties arising in the justification of ( [ 9.4 ] ) . according to ( [ 9.5 ] ) already at the moment of the first period - doubling bifurcation , fixed point @xmath169 belongs to an @xmath79 neighborhood of @xmath28 . in this neighborhood , @xmath249 ( see ( [ 5.22 ] ) ) and , therefore , @xmath169 lies outside of the region of validity of the asymptotic analysis . in this region , ( [ 9.4 ] ) may only be considered as a formal asymptotic expression .",
    "a rigorous justification of the from of the map in the boundary layer meets substantial analytical difficulties : it requires introducing an additional set of intermediate asymptotic expansions and matching them with those obtained in section 3 .",
    "we do not address this problem in the present work .",
    "below , we resort to using numerical techniques to verify the principal features of the first return map suggested by the asymptotic analysis : the unimodality of @xmath242 and its dependence on @xmath51 .",
    "the numerics confirmed our predictions about the form of the first return map and it also revealed certain additional features .    for numerical construction of the first - return map",
    ", we fix angle @xmath250 and define a crossection in cylindrical coordinates : @xmath251 let @xmath252 be a trajectory of ( [ 6.5 ] ) and @xmath253 denote a sequence of times , at which @xmath254 .",
    "then , we define : ( t_k ) ( t_k+1)(t ) = . by a suitable choice of @xmath255",
    ", we can achieve that a trajectory of ( [ 6.5 ] ) , intersects @xmath256 once during one cycle of oscillations .",
    "therefore , for a trajectory lying in a @xmath2 slow manifold , ( [ 9.6 ] ) defines a @xmath1 first - return map .",
    "note that maps ( [ 9.4 ] ) and ( [ 9.6 ] ) are related via rescaling of the coefficients , since to leading order @xmath257 .",
    "therefore , the graphs of @xmath258 and @xmath259 are similar in the domain , where ( [ 9.4 ] ) is valid .",
    "we computed the first return maps for fixed @xmath260 and for several values of @xmath51 .",
    "the representative plots are shown in figure [ f.8 ] a - c .",
    "the numerically computed maps confirmed our expectations about the graph of @xmath261 in the boundary layer near @xmath28 : in this region , the map is decreasing with a strongly expanding slope . away from @xmath28 , the graph of @xmath261",
    "contains an almost linear branch , whose slope is very close to @xmath262 as predicted by ( [ 9.4 ] ) ( see lower branches in figure [ f.8]b , c ) .",
    "these numerics also confirm that under the variation of @xmath51 , the graph of the first return map is translated in vertical direction ( figure [ f.8 ] a - c ) .",
    "therefore , the family of the first return maps possesses two principal ingredients ( the unimodality and the additive dependence on @xmath51 ) , which are necessary for the qualitative explanation of the bifurcation scenario given in figure [ f.7 ] .",
    "in addition , our numerical experiments reveal a new feature of the first return map : for small @xmath263 , the graph of the map has another almost linear branch in the outer region away from the origin ( see figure [ f.8]b ) .",
    "this branch of the graph of the map also has an attracting slope .",
    "the presence of this branch in the first return map indicates the existence of another ( branch of the ) slow manifold different from that described in section 3 .",
    "a possible explanation for the appearance of the upper branch in the first return map is due to the unstable manifold of the periodic orbit . for small @xmath263 , the first - return map ( [ 9.6 ] )",
    "is multivalued in the outer region . however , since both the upper and the lower branches have positive slopes less than @xmath264 , the qualitative dynamics for the map shown in figure [ f.8]b does not depend on the exact mechanism for the selection between the branches in ( [ 9.6 ] ) .",
    "although explaining the multivaluedness of the first return maps shown in figures [ f.8]b , c presents an interesting problem , it is not critical for the qualitative explanation of the bifurcation scenario arising during the transition from the subcritical to supercritical ahb .",
    "the latter was the main goal of the present subsection .",
    "* remark 4.2 * in addition , to the region in the parameter space containing the border between the regions of sub- and supercritical ahb , there is another parameter regime resulting in the complex dynamics . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown numerically that the limit cycle born from the supercritical ahb in ( [ 6.5 ] ) undergoes a period - doubling cascade leading to the formation of the chaotic attractor for increasing values of @xmath22 .",
    "the first period - doubling bifurcation in this cascade is shown in figure [ f.1]c , d .",
    "this bifurcation scenario is consistent with the form of the first - return map constructed in this subsection .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see from ( [ 9.5 ] ) that for increasing values of @xmath55 the fixed point , @xmath169 , moves to the left .",
    "therefore , the explanation given above for the period - doubling cascade resulting from the variation of @xmath51 near @xmath28 also applies to the case of increasing @xmath22 and fixed @xmath265 ( see figure [ f.8]d ) .",

    "for the finite dimensional approximation of the model of solid - fuel combustion ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) , the main motivating example for our work , the proximity to the homoclinic bifurcation was suggested in @xcite as a possible mechanism for prolonged isis .",
    "our conclusions confirm the importance of the proximity to the homoclinic bifurcation for explaining the oscillatory patterns in ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) .",
    "the proximity to the homoclinic bifurcation is implicitly reflected in our assumptions on the global vector field .",
    "however , we emphasize the critical role of the ahb : the duration of the isis can be effectively controlled by the parameters associated with the ahb without changing the distance of the system to the homoclinic bifurcation . in all our numerical experiments , the system remained bounded away from the homoclinic bifurcation , nevertheless it exhibited patterns with very long isis whose duration was amenable to control .",
    "our analysis extends the estimate for the isis obtained in @xcite to a wide class of problems .",
    "it also emphasizes the proximity of the system to the border between sub- and supercritical ahb , as another factor in creating oscillatory patterns with long isis .",
    "we show that as this border is approached from the subcritical side the isi grow logarithmically .",
    "this observation is important for explaining the oscillatory patterns generated by ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) since in this model the ahb can change its type under the variation of the second control parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this situation is not specific to the model of solid fuel combustion .",
    "recent studies suggest that there is a class of neuronal models close to the ahb whose type may change with the values of parameters @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the principal features of the transition from sub- to supercritical ahb .",
    "we found that when the border between the regions of sub- and supercritical bifurcation is approached from the subcritical side ( while the distance from the ahb remains fixed ) , the oscillations become chaotic .",
    "the regime of irregular oscillations is then followed by the reverse period doubling cascade . to understand the nature of this bifurcation scenario we used a combination of analytic and numerical techniques . using the insights gained from the asymptotic analysis , we constructed a @xmath1 first - return map .",
    "the map provides a clear geometric interpretation for the bifurcation scenario near the transition from sub- to supercritical ahb .",
    "our study suggests that the formation of the chaotic attractor via a period - doubling cascade is a universal feature of this transition .",
    "for example , the bifurcation scenarios reported for the hodgkin - huxley model in @xcite are very similar to those studied in the present paper and are likely to share the same mechanism .",
    "mixed - mode oscillations similar to those studied in the present paper , have been studied in for a class of the slow - fast systems in @xmath0 near the ahb .",
    "although , the work toward developing a complete mathematical theory for such oscillations is still in progress , the general mechanism for their generation and the bifurcation structure of the problem have been greatly elucidated recently @xcite .",
    "the present paper shows the relation between the mechanisms for the mixed - mode oscillations in the model in @xcite and for those in the slow - fast systems .",
    "the latter possess a well - defined structure of the global vector field due to the presence of the disparate timescales in the governing equations @xcite .",
    "the analyses of the mixed - mode oscillations in @xcite use in an essential way the relaxation structure of the problem .",
    "the model in @xcite is an example of the mixed - mode generating system , which does not possess an explicit relaxation structure .",
    "in fact , it is hard to expect such structure in a system obtained via projecting an infinite - dimensional system onto a finite - dimensional subspace . in formulating the assumptions on the global vector - field ( * g1 * ) and ( * g2 * ) , we were looking for the minimal requirements on the system near an ahb that guarantee the existence of the mixed - mode solutions . due to the lack of the information about the global vector field of ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] )",
    ", it appears impossible to verify these conditions analytically .",
    "however , the numerical simulations clearly show that system of equations ( [ 6.1])-([6.3 ] ) possesses the qualitative structure required by ( * g1 * ) and ( * g2 * ) ( figure [ f.2]b ) . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that conditions ( * g1 * ) and ( * g2 * ) should be possible to verify analytically for a wide class of slow - fast systems",

    "<S> we also identify a window of complex and possibly chaotic oscillations near the boundary between the regions of sub- and supercritical ahb and explain the mechanism generating these oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> this work is motivated by the numerical results for a finite - dimensional approximation of a free boundary problem modeling solid fuel combustion . </S>"
