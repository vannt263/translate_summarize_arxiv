    "an important challenge in quantum information science is to protect quantum memories and communication channels against unwanted couplings within this quantum system or to an environment .",
    "it is to this end that , in 1999 , viola _",
    "presented a promising method they called dynamical decoupling @xcite . in this method ,",
    "local control operations are used to counteract the influence of unwanted couplings with an environment .",
    "it can be seen as a generalization of techniques which were previously developed in the area of nuclear magnetic resonance . the spin - echo effect",
    "@xcite is a well - known example of the latter . over the years",
    ", dynamical decoupling has been successfully implemented in experimental setups to protect quantum systems against unwanted influences @xcite .",
    "typically , dynamical decoupling schemes assume that the quantum system to be protected can be manipulated by a set of fast local control operations .",
    "as a first approximation , it is often assumed that these control operations act instantaneously ( bang - bang control @xcite ) and that they can be represented by a set of unitary operators . by choosing an appropriate set of unitary operators and applying them in a particular order , it is possible to change the state of a quantum system unitarily such that the effects of unwanted hamiltonian interactions are averaged out approximately .",
    "in contrast to quantum error correction , which is capable of correcting errors perfectly , dynamical decoupling generally only suppresses unwanted couplings .",
    "however , the use of unitary control operations is not limited to suppressing decoherence effects or unwanted intra - particle couplings within a many - particle quantum system .",
    "@xcite already showed that dynamical decoupling can also be used to suppress only certain components of a many - particle hamiltonian selectively .",
    "thus , it is possible to develop control strategies that , within certain limits , are suitable for the purpose of quantum simulation , meaning that the effects of a present hamiltonian interaction with active controls on a quantum system resemble those of a different hamiltonian .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that any quantum system with a non - trivial hamiltonian can simulate any other hamiltonian interaction , provided that a suitable finite set of unitary control operations is available .",
    "@xcite showed that any two - body hamiltonian on a qubit network can be simulated by any two - body entangling hamiltonian with the help of local unitaries , a result that was generalized to qudit systems by nielsen _",
    "_ in @xcite .    for purposes of quantum information processing ,",
    "it is of particular interest to develop error - suppressing dynamical decoupling schemes and quantum simulation schemes for systems comprised of distinguishable qubits . for these systems , a special case of decoupling controls is frequently discussed where all control operations consist of instantaneously applied pauli operations acting locally on each qubit separately .",
    "numerous efficient schemes of this kind have been developed which are capable of suppressing environmental errors or unwanted inter - qubit couplings in many - qubit systems .",
    "stollsteimer and mahler @xcite , for example , proposed a construction based on orthogonal arrays , while leung @xcite presented a decoupling method based on hadamard matrices .",
    "both approaches were eventually unified by rtteler and wocjan @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also discussed applications of similar constructions to quantum simulation scenarios @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several advanced control strategies have been devised to enhance the performance of basic decoupling schemes . despite these interesting developments",
    ", it remains a challenge to find and implement suitable pauli pulse schemes for the purpose of quantum simulation .",
    "while specific constructions for specific scenarios have been developed , so far there has been no systematic method for constructing dynamical decoupling schemes from simple pauli pulses for a general scenario that applies to both error suppression and quantum simulation for arbitrary many - body hamiltonians .    in this paper , we present a systematic method for constructing decoupling schemes from local pauli pulses on networks of qubits that are capable of changing the action of a given arbitrary hamiltonian @xmath0 to that of a wanted `` ideal '' hamiltonian @xmath1 . only ( partial )",
    "knowledge of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is required ; there is no dependency on the availability of , e.g. , suitable orthogonal arrays .",
    "this method is not only useful for protecting specific inter - particle couplings against unwanted couplings or environmental influences , but also for simulating ideal hamiltonian dynamics within certain limits .",
    "the restriction to local pauli operations leads to a particularly simple , but still powerful procedure which exploits two basic properties of the pauli operators , namely that they are hermitian and unitary and that they fulfill characteristic clifford - type algebraic relations .",
    "we will also show that certain aspects of these properties carry over to generalized spin operators , allowing our method to be generalized to qudit networks of arbitrary dimension .",
    "although the method does not work for all possible pairs of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , its limitations are easily understood and still allow for a multitude of interesting applications .",

    "[ sec : examples ] , our construction method is applied to some simple examples . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : qudits ] , the generalization of this construction to qudit networks is discussed briefly .",
    "technical details concerning these higher - dimensional generalizations are presented in three appendices .",
    "a fourth appendix contains details of numerical simulations conducted to study the effectiveness of some of our schemes .",
    "in this section , basic known principles of dynamical decoupling on networks of qubits are summarized which are important for our subsequent discussion .    we consider a quantum system consisting of @xmath2 qubits whose state space is described by the hilbert space @xmath3 with @xmath4 the hilbert space of an arbitrary environment .",
    "the time evolution of the whole system is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "let us assume that at the beginning of periodic time intervals of length @xmath5 we can apply instantaneously ( bang - bang control ) any of the unitary and hermitian pauli operators @xmath6 to any qubit individually .",
    "this results in unitary pulses of the form @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is used if no control action is taken on a particular qubit .",
    "after @xmath9 such instantaneous control pulses the time evolution of the total system is described by the unitary operator ( we assume @xmath10 ) @xmath11 where we introduced the operators @xmath12 .",
    "this time evolution can also be described by an effective average hamiltonian @xmath13 : @xmath14 the operator @xmath15 is arbitrary and can be chosen to be the identity operation .",
    "@xmath13 depends on @xmath5 , and we can do a magnus expansion @xcite to develop @xmath13 into a series of terms depending on increasing orders of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath16    the main goal of approximate quantum simulation by dynamical decoupling is to construct a sequence of control pulses @xmath17 such that , to the lowest order of the magnus expansion @xmath18 , the original hamiltonian @xmath0 is transformed into a wanted ideal hamiltonian @xmath1 of the @xmath2-qubit system which contains no couplings between the @xmath2 qubits and the environment and which may have modified inner couplings between the qubits .",
    "the lowest order of the magnus expansion is given by @xmath19 we call a set of operators @xmath20 a decoupling scheme if they transform a hamiltonian @xmath0 into @xmath1 to lowest order , as expressed by the decoupling condition : @xmath21 we allow for a possible scaling factor @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "this factor may require a rescaling of the physical time of the simulated quantum system by @xmath24 .",
    "such a quantum simulation is only approximate since , in general , the higher orders of @xmath13 do not vanish .",
    "however , as @xmath25 , for sufficiently small time delays @xmath5 these higher - order corrections become small .",
    "one of the most important practical questions , which is addressed in the subsequent sections , is whether , for a specific choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a decoupling scheme exists at all and how it can be constructed .",
    "in this section , a systematic method for constructing dynamical decoupling schemes on qubit networks is presented which is capable of transforming the dynamics of a given hamiltonian @xmath0 into the dynamics of a wanted ideal hamiltonian @xmath1 by only using pauli pulses . this way , unwanted environmental interactions can be suppressed and an ideal hamiltonian dynamics can be simulated approximately .",
    "an extension to a network of qudits of arbitrary dimension @xmath26 is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : qudits ] .      using the notation of sec .",
    "[ sec : decoupling_basics ] , we notice that on the hilbert space @xmath27 of an @xmath2-qubit network , the set of the @xmath28 operators , @xmath29,\\ ] ] with the base-4 representation @xmath30 , forms a basis for linear operators on @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , one can expand both @xmath2-qubit system hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 in this basis with coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 here the arbitrary linear operators @xmath34 act on the hilbert space @xmath4 of the environment .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that we are looking for a dynamical decoupling scheme which removes all possible couplings between the @xmath2-qubit system and the environment . the part of the hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 which acts on the environment only is denoted @xmath35 and its precise form is not important for our subsequent discussion . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "let us also assume that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are traceless so that the operator @xmath36 can be omitted from the expansion ( [ eq : basis_representation ] ) .    by inserting the basis expansion ( [ eq : basis_representation ] ) into the decoupling condition of eq . , we obtain the relations @xmath37 since all of the control pulses @xmath38 are chosen from the set of basis operators @xmath39",
    ", it follows from the basic algebraic properties of the pauli operators that their products @xmath40 can also be expressed by one of the basis operators , up to a global phase , e.g. @xmath41 . since this phase vanishes in @xmath18",
    ", we can replace the sum over the operators @xmath40 in by a sum over the basis operators @xmath42 , where we introduce natural number variables @xmath43 which count how often each basis operator @xmath42 occurs in our decoupling scheme @xmath44 . with this replacement ,",
    "we arrive at relation .",
    "since for all pauli operators ( including the identity operation ) the clifford - type relation @xmath45 holds , it is also true that @xmath46 .",
    "if we incorporate these signs into the variables @xmath47 of unit modulus , we finally arrive at relation .    due to the linear independence of the operators @xmath48 in ,",
    "their coefficients can be compared individually in eq . .",
    "this comparison yields a system of , at most , @xmath49 linear equations for the @xmath28 unknown natural numbers @xmath43 .",
    "however , we immediately notice a restriction concerning the solvability of this linear system of equations : if for any @xmath50 $ ] either @xmath51 or @xmath52 , then the corresponding expansion coefficient of @xmath1 has to vanish , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "this reflects the fact that any term not present in the originally given hamiltonian @xmath0 can not be created by our decoupling scheme in the ideal hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , any operator @xmath48 of the original hamiltonian @xmath0 which has nontrivial couplings with the environment , i.e. , @xmath52 , can only be suppressed completely and thus can not appear in the ideal hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain the following set of linear equations : @xmath54 : \\mu_k \\neq 0 \\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath55 denoting the set of indices of operators @xmath48 which are present in the basis expansion of the originally given hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "we need to solve for the non - negative natural numbers @xmath43 as well as for @xmath24 and @xmath9 which are not all independent .",
    "this is due to the fact that , since @xmath9 is the total number of operators in our decoupling scheme , the relation @xmath56 must be fulfilled . introducing variables @xmath57 ,",
    "our system of equations is finally given by @xmath58 by construction , the @xmath59 fulfill the relation @xmath60 , and @xmath9 can be found by determining @xmath9 as the lowest common denominator for the rational numbers @xmath61 .",
    "one could also choose a larger denominator for @xmath9 .",
    "however , this would result in a structurally identical scheme that consists of repetitions of the shorter scheme .",
    "let us now address the question of under which conditions the system of linear equations has suitable solutions .",
    "let us first analyze the set of all possible real - valued solutions for the quantities @xmath59 .",
    "the system of equations depends on the previously introduced variables @xmath62 of unit modulus , which can be computed from the algebraic properties of the operators @xmath48 and @xmath42 . doing so for all pairs of our operator basis yields a @xmath63 square matrix @xmath64 with entries @xmath65 . for @xmath66",
    ", we can calculate @xmath67 directly from the pauli operators and obtain a so - called hadamard matrix , @xmath68 hadamard matrices have the characteristic property that their entries have the values @xmath65 and their rows are mutually orthogonal .",
    "due to the way the operators @xmath48 are constructed as tensor products of pauli operators , it follows that higher - order matrices @xmath69 can be constructed from lower - order ones by the recursive relation @xmath70 this recursive construction is similar to the well - known sylvester construction for hadamard matrices @xcite . from this construction",
    ", we can conclude by induction that @xmath69 is a hadamard matrix .",
    "a connection between hadamard matrices and quantum simulation schemes on qubit networks was already discovered in @xcite , albeit in a more limited context .",
    "proofs of the stated properties of the system matrix can be found in appendix [ app : matrix ] for the more general qudit case .",
    "since hadamard matrices have full rank and we use only @xmath71 rows from the matrix in our system of equations , we can conclude that the system has infinitely many real - valued solutions for the variables @xmath59 .",
    "now , let @xmath72 be the @xmath73 matrix resulting from the matrix @xmath69 by including only the rows @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "then we can express our system of equations in compact vector form : @xmath76 here , @xmath77 is the @xmath28-dimensional vector of our variables @xmath59 , and @xmath78 is the @xmath79-dimensional vector of the right - hand side of . in order to find the general solution of this linear system of equations , we first solve for the homogeneous part , @xmath80 .",
    "the linear space of these solutions has dimension @xmath81 .",
    "as the rows of the hadamard matrix @xmath69 are orthogonal and the scalar product of any two row vectors @xmath82 and @xmath74 fulfills the relation @xmath83 we conclude that any multiple of a row of @xmath69 not contained in @xmath72 is a solution of the homogeneous equation .",
    "therefore , the most general homogeneous solution @xmath84 is of the form @xmath85 a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation can be constructed by noticing that from relation , one can conclude that @xmath86 this yields the particular solution @xmath87 therefore , the most general solution of the system of equations is given by @xmath88    starting from this result , we now need to construct a set of @xmath43 with non - negative integer values .",
    "let us address the issue of non - negativity first .",
    "in order for @xmath43 to be non - negative the quantities @xmath59 must be non - negative , too .",
    "this latter requirement can be met by starting from an arbitrary solution of the system of equations @xmath77 . because the first row of the hadamard matrix @xmath89 is never a part of @xmath72 ( due to the hamiltonians being traceless )",
    ", it is a solution to the homogeneous equation , and so an arbitrary multiple @xmath90 of this first row can always be added to @xmath77 . in particular , one can choose the multiple as @xmath91 over all entries in a given @xmath77 .",
    "adding @xmath92 to @xmath77 ensures that all entries in the resulting solution are non - negative .    starting from such a non - negative solution , the quantities @xmath43 will be integral if the numbers @xmath61 are rational .",
    "whether such solutions exist depends entirely on the particular solution @xmath93 and therefore on the structure of the vector @xmath78 . for this purpose",
    ", it is required that all entries of @xmath78 are rational or that they share at most a common real multiplier so that @xmath94 , with @xmath95 denoting a rational vector .",
    "however , for practical purposes , we can relax this rather stringent condition .",
    "even if the entries of @xmath78 are not rational , it is quite acceptable from a practical point of view to round these quantities to suitable rational numbers .",
    "this is possible because dynamical decoupling is already approximate in nature and the lowest order @xmath18 is linear in the quantities @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , any error originating from rounding will affect @xmath18 linearly only , and we conclude that we can always find solutions @xmath43 suitable for decoupling from the linear system , at least approximately .      the presented system of linear equations allows us to calculate solutions for the variables @xmath43 which determine how often each of the basis operators @xmath48 appears in the constructed decoupling scheme .",
    "thus , these variables describe our decoupling scheme completely .",
    "this means that we can always find a decoupling scheme for any given original hamiltonian @xmath0 provided the ideal hamiltonian @xmath1 does not contain operators @xmath48 which are either missing in @xmath0 or which are coupled with the environment .    however , the linear system has infinitely many solutions , and consequently infinitely many decoupling schemes exist .",
    "although they all simulate the hamiltonian @xmath1 to lowest order , they can differ significantly in their size @xmath9 and choice of decoupling operators @xmath40 as well as the scaling constant @xmath24 .",
    "in general , it is not apparent from these characteristic quantities how a decoupling scheme performs in practice .",
    "while their effect on the lowest order of the average hamiltonian @xmath13 is identical , the effect on higher orders can be very different . for practical purposes , it is usually preferable to find a decoupling sequence which is short ( small @xmath9 ) and has a scaling @xmath24 as close to 1 as possible .",
    "the most straightforward construction of a decoupling scheme is based on the particular solution @xmath93 , which can be readily calculated and then modified , as described , to yield a positive solution for the @xmath43 .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that the particular solution often produces very large decoupling schemes with large scaling factors @xmath24 . to improve the generated decoupling scheme , we need to exploit the freedom presented by the general homogeneous solution .",
    "unfortunately , it is not apparent how to modify the particular solution in such a way that the resulting scheme has minimal @xmath9 and @xmath24 .",
    "there is a way to find solutions to the linear system which are guaranteed to have minimal scaling @xmath24 .",
    "this is done by employing linear programming .",
    "linear programming is a technique to optimize a linear objective function of a set of variables under certain linear equality and inequality constraints . in our case",
    ", we can use linear programming for the set of variables @xmath59 and minimize @xmath96 subject to the linear equality constraints , which will return a solution that is guaranteed to have minimal scaling . however",
    ", this approach does not guarantee a minimal scheme size @xmath9 . for small qubit systems with @xmath97 we found empirically that the particular solutions generated by typical linear programming solvers often produce sufficiently short decoupling schemes , which are practically usable , but in some instances we were able to manually construct shorter schemes with the same minimal scaling @xmath24 .",
    "given that the number of variables and the set of equations grow exponentially with the number of qubits @xmath2 , constructing solutions by any method will become increasingly difficult with growing @xmath2 . to find schemes for larger numbers of qubits ,",
    "it is often better to calculate a solution for a smaller problem instance and then induce a scheme for the full system from the smaller solution .",
    "in the following , we present some basic examples of how to apply our scheme construction to specific scenarios .       and @xmath98 coupled to separate environments @xmath99 and @xmath100.[fig : twoqubits ] ]    in this example , we consider two physically separated , distinguishable qubits @xmath101 and @xmath102 , which interact according to a time - independent interaction hamiltonian @xmath103 . furthermore , both qubits are coupled to independent environments @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which introduce decoherence and damping .",
    "[ fig : twoqubits ] for a visual depiction .",
    "the full dynamics of the system is then described by the most general hamiltonian , @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are arbitrary hermitian operators on their corresponding environments , and @xmath109 means the @xmath110-th pauli operator acting on the @xmath111-th qubit .",
    "we ignore potential interactions within and between the environments as they are not relevant to our discussion .",
    "our goal is to find a decoupling scheme to turn the acting hamiltonian @xmath0 into the ideal hamiltonian @xmath112 . for this purpose",
    ", we have to solve the system of linear equations ( [ eq : dec_matrix ] ) .",
    "the system matrix @xmath113 is known and independent of the two hamiltonians involved . for the coefficients of the vector @xmath78 , which determine the inhomogeneous part of the set of equations , we find @xmath114    the particular solution @xmath93 to the set of equations allows us to construct the following decoupling scheme by means of the previously described procedure : @xmath115 here , the two numbers @xmath110 and @xmath116 of each column represent an operator @xmath117 of our decoupling scheme .",
    "we see that the scheme consists of a total sequence of @xmath118 pulses .",
    "they involve free evolution ( identity pulses applied three times ) and a sequence in which all combinations of pauli operators appear exactly once .",
    "the scaling constant for this decoupling scheme is @xmath119 .",
    "this is the minimal possible value of @xmath24 which can be verified by linear programming .",
    "let us now consider a specific interaction hamiltonian in the form of a two - qubit heisenberg hamiltonian , @xmath121 this hamiltonian can be used to implement the entangling gate @xmath120 if applied over a time interval of duration @xmath122 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "entangling gates are particularly interesting in quantum information because they can create an entangled state from a separable two - qubit state .    for the interaction with the environment ,",
    "let us now assume that each qubit is coupled to a harmonic oscillator as described by the hamiltonian @xmath123 here , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath98 , @xmath126 are the creation and annihilation operators of the two oscillators , and @xmath127 .",

    ", the hamiltonian in contains only three out of nine possible two - qubit basis operators and the error terms in involve only four out of six possible operators .",
    "taking these special circumstances into account , we can simplify the system of equations ( [ eq : dec_matrix ] ) by omitting eight equations . as a result",
    ", we find the significantly simpler dynamical decoupling scheme : @xmath129 this particular protection scheme involves only four decoupling operators and has an improved scaling factor of @xmath130 .",
    "this means that no rescaling of the interaction time is necessary , therefore allowing the gate to be implemented faster .",
    "furthermore , the control operators @xmath131 required for the special scheme can be implemented with the help of pulses @xmath17 utilizing only @xmath132 and @xmath133 pulses , whereas the general scheme also requires @xmath134 pulses , so it should be easier to implement experimentally .    to study the effectiveness of our protection schemes , we conducted numerical simulations of the achievable state fidelity depending on the error strength @xmath128 and the pulse delay time @xmath5 .",
    "the results are very encouraging because even under the influence of strong errors , a state fidelity close to @xmath101 is reached with pulse delays as large as @xmath135 . a detailed presentation of the numerical results and a comparison between the two decoupling schemes is included in appendix [ sec : numerical ] .      ]    as another example , let us consider a closed chain of four qubits with @xmath137 coupling between each qubit pair , as depicted in fig .",

    "although they were presented in separate examples , our method also allows for any combination of these cases in a single scenario .    due to the exponential scaling with the number of qubits @xmath2 of the linear system used in our method and the infinitely many solutions that exist , there are some practical limitations to be aware of",
    ". although it is straight - forward to calculate a scheme from the particular solution , these schemes are typically very large and therefore not practical . to improve the generated scheme , one can , in principle , make use of the degrees of freedom presented by the general homogeneous solution , but so far no systematic procedure is known which guarantees a shorter and superior scheme .",
