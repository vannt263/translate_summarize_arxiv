    "a major objective for nuclear physicists is to establish the technology with which to reliably calculate the properties and interactions of nuclei and to be able to quantify the uncertainties in such calculations .",
    "achieving this objective will have broad impact , from establishing the behavior of matter under extreme conditions such as those that arise in the interior of neutron stars , to refining predictions for the array of isotopes produced in nuclear reactors , and even to answering anthropic questions about the nature of our universe . while nuclear phenomenology generally describes experimentally measured quantities , its ability to make high precision and accurate predictions for quantities that can not be accessed experimentally is limited .",
    "this situation is on the verge of dramatically improving .",
    "the underlying theory of the strong interactions is known to be quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and the computational resources now available are beginning to allow for _ ab initio _ calculations of basic quantities in nuclear physics . with further increases in computational power and advances in algorithms",
    ", this trend will continue and our understanding of , and our ability to calculate , light and exotic nuclei will be placed on a solid foundation .    in nature , two nucleons in the @xmath12 coupled channels bind to form the simplest nucleus , the deuteron ( @xmath13 ) , with a binding energy of @xmath14 , and nearly bind into a di - neutron in the @xmath15 channel .",
    "however , little is known experimentally about possible bound states in more exotic channels , for instance those containing strange quarks .",
    "the most famous exotic channel that has been postulated to support a bound state ( the h - dibaryon  @xcite ) has the quantum numbers of @xmath16 ( total angular momentum @xmath17 , isospin @xmath18 and strangeness @xmath19 ) . in this channel ,",
    "all six quarks in naive quark models , like the mit bag model , can be in the lowest - energy single - particle state .",
    "additionally , more extensive analyses using one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models  @xcite and low - energy effective field theories ( eft )  @xcite , both constrained by experimentally measured nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) cross - sections and the approximate su(3 ) flavor symmetry of the strong interactions , suggest that other exotic channels also support bound states . in the limit of su(3 )",
    "flavor symmetry , the @xmath15-channels are in symmetric irreducible representations of @xmath20 , and hence the @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( along with @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) all transform in the @xmath25 .",
    "yn and nn scattering data along with the leading su(3 ) breaking effects , arising from the light - meson and baryon masses , suggest that @xmath0 and @xmath21 are bound at the physical values of the light - quark masses  @xcite .",
    "recently , the first steps have been taken towards calculating the binding energies of light nuclei directly from qcd .",
    "early exploratory quenched calculations of the nn scattering lengths  @xcite performed more than a decade ago have been superseded by @xmath2 calculations within the last few years  @xcite ( and added to by further quenched calculations  @xcite  ) .",
    "further , the first quenched calculations of the deuteron  @xcite , @xmath26he and @xmath27he  @xcite have been performed , along with @xmath2 calculations of @xmath26he  @xcite and multi - baryon systems containing strange quarks  @xcite . efforts to explore nuclei and nuclear matter using the strong coupling limit of qcd have led to some interesting observations  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath2 calculations by us ( nplqcd )  @xcite , and subsequent @xmath28 calculations by the halqcd collaboration  @xcite , have provided evidence that the h - dibaryon ( with the quantum numbers of @xmath16 ) is bound at a pion mass of @xmath29 [ nplqcd ] and @xmath30 [ halqcd ]  . ] .",
    "extrapolations to the physical light - quark masses suggest a weakly bound h - dibaryon or a near threshold resonance exists in this channel  @xcite .    in this work , which is a continuation of our high - statistics lattice qcd explorations  @xcite , we present evidence for @xmath31 and h - dibaryon ( refining of our results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) bound states , and weak evidence for a bound deuteron and di - neutron at a pion mass of @xmath1 .",
    "the results were obtained from four ensembles of @xmath2 anisotropic clover gauge - field configurations with a spatial lattice spacing of @xmath32 , an anisotropy of @xmath33 and with cubic volumes of spatial extent @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , a concise description of the specific lqcd technology and computational details relevant to the present two - body bound state calculations are given .",
    "section  [ sec : b ] presents the results of the lqcd calculations of the single baryon masses and dispersion relations ( critical for understanding bound systems ) , and in section  [ sec : bb ] the results for the bound states are presented .",
    "discussions and our conclusions can be found in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) is a technique in which space - time is discretized into a four - dimensional grid and the qcd path integral over the quark and gluon fields at each point in the grid is performed in euclidean space - time using monte carlo methods .",
    "a lqcd calculation of a given quantity will differ from its actual value because of the finite volume of the space - time ( with @xmath34 lattice points ) over which the fields exist , and the finite separation between space - time points ( the lattice - spacing ) .",
    "however , such deviations can be systematically removed by performing calculations in multiple volumes with multiple lattice spacings , and extrapolating using the theoretically known functional dependences on each . in the following subsections ,",
    "we review the details of lqcd calculations relevant to the current work and introduce the ensembles studied herein .",
    "the hadron - hadron scattering amplitude below the inelastic threshold can be determined from two - hadron energy levels in the lattice volume using lscher s method  @xcite .",
    "in the situation where only a single scattering channel is kinematically allowed , the deviation of the energy eigenvalues of the two - hadron system in the lattice volume from the sum of the single - hadron energies is related to the scattering phase shift , @xmath35 , at the measured two - hadron energies . for energy eigenvalues above kinematic thresholds where multiple channels contribute ,",
    "a coupled - channels analysis is required as a single phase shift does not parameterize the s - matrix .",
    "such analyses can be performed , but they are not required in the current context . the energy shift for two particles @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , can be determined from the correlation functions for systems containing one and two hadrons . for baryon - baryon systems ,",
    "correlation functions of the form @xmath39 are used , where @xmath40 denotes a baryon interpolating operator , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are dirac indices , and the @xmath43 are dirac matrices that typically project onto particular parity and angular momentum states .",

    "other hadrons in the lowest - lying octet can be obtained from the appropriate combinations of quark flavors .",
    "the brackets in the interpolating operators indicate contraction of spin indices into a spin-0 `` diquark '' . away from the time slice of the source ( in this case @xmath49 ) ,",
    "these correlation functions behave as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the energy eigenvalues of the two - hadron system at rest in the lattice volume .",

    "this analysis has recently been extended to bound systems that are moving in the lattice volume  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic gauge field configurations have proven useful for the study of hadronic spectroscopy , and as the calculations required for studying multi - hadron systems rely heavily on spectroscopy , considerable effort has been put into calculations with clover - improved wilson fermion actions with an anisotropic discretization . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath2 flavor anisotropic clover wilson action  @xcite with two steps of stout - link smearing  @xcite of the spatial gauge fields in the fermion action with a smearing weight of @xmath86 has been used  @xcite .",
    "the gauge fields entering the fermion action are not smeared in the time direction , thus preserving the ultra - locality of the action in the time direction .",
    "further , a tree - level tadpole - improved symanzik gauge action without a @xmath87 rectangle in the time direction is used .",
    "anisotropy allows for a better extraction of the excited states as well as additional confidence that plateaus in the effective mass plots ( emps ) formed from the correlation functions have been observed , significantly reducing the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the gauge field generation was performed by the hadron spectrum collaboration ( hsc ) and by us , and these gauge field configurations have been extensively used for excited hadron spectrum calculations by hsc  @xcite .",

    "the masses are in temporal lattice units ( t.l.u ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our lqcd calculations were performed at one lattice spacing , @xmath32 , but discretization effects are expected to be small as they scale as @xmath119 for the clover action .",
    "consequently , we do not expect them to significantly alter our conclusions .",
    "a second lattice spacing is required to quantify this systematic uncertainty .    by far the most significant result",
    "is that the h - dibaryon is bound at the @xmath120 level at this pion mass , improving on results we have already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the @xmath121 level of significance , we find that the @xmath0 system is also bound , which is qualitatively consistent with an array of hadronic models and eft analyses of this system at the physical light - quark masses .",
    "it is interesting to note that the level of precision of the @xmath0 binding from lqcd is comparable to the level of precision associated with the phenomenological predictions .",
    "with increasing computational resources directed at these two - baryon systems , the qcd prediction will become more precise and eventually become input for phenomenological models and will be used to constrain the coefficients appearing in the effective field theories .",
    "a major goal of lattice qcd is to postdict the anomalously small binding energy of the deuteron .",
    "we have presented evidence for a bound deuteron from qcd , however the @xmath122 level of significance is well below `` discovery level '' , and our result should be considered a first step toward a definitive calculation . nevertheless , it is now unambiguously clear that a precise determination of the deuteron binding energy can be performed with sufficient computational resources .",
    "our result hints that the deuteron is bound , as does the result of a previous quenched calculation , at heavy pion masses , in contrast with phenomenological analyses and with eft predictions .",
    "we also find suggestions of a bound di - neutron which are far from definitive , but are consistent with the quenched result at a heavier pion mass  @xcite . if this remains the case when the calculation is refined , there are light - quark masses between @xmath123 and @xmath1 for which the scattering length in this channel would be infinite and the system would be scale - invariant at low energies .",
    "phenomenology based upon flavor su(3 ) symmetry indicates that the @xmath0 system should be more bound than the @xmath21 system , which in turn should be more bound than the di - neutron ( which is nearly bound ) at the physical light - quark masses , as these three systems are all members of the same @xmath25 irreducible representation of su(3 ) .",
    "our results are consistent with this , but further work is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the results of the lattice qcd calculations presented in this paper , which refine and broaden our previous work  @xcite , provide clear evidence for bound - states of two baryons directly from qcd . with the suggestion of a deuteron and a bound di - neutron at this heavier pion mass",
    ", there is compelling motivation to invest larger computational resources into pursuing lattice qcd calculations at light - quark masses , and to perform such calculations in multiple volumes and with multiple lattice spacings .",

    "<S> results of a high - statistics , multi - volume lattice qcd exploration of the deuteron , the di - neutron , the h - dibaryon , and the @xmath0 system at a pion mass of @xmath1 are presented . </S>",
    "<S> calculations were performed with an anisotropic @xmath2 clover discretization in four lattice volumes of spatial extent @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with a lattice spacing of @xmath5 in the spatial - direction , and @xmath6 in the time - direction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 is found to be bound by @xmath8 , consistent with expectations based upon phenomenological models and low - energy effective field theories constrained by nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon scattering data at the physical light - quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> we find weak evidence that both the deuteron and the di - neutron are bound at this pion mass , with binding energies of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . with an increased number of measurements and a refined analysis , </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy of the h - dibaryon is @xmath11 at this pion mass , updating our previous result .    -1.5 </S>"
