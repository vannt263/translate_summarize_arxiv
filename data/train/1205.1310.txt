    "+ for what concerns higher dimensional varieties , the syzygies of the projective space were studied by green in @xcite , @xcite , and in the recent preprint @xcite . for arbitrary smooth varieties",

    "abelian varieties distinguish themselves among other smooth varieties since , at least in what concerns their syzygies , they tend to behave in any dimension like elliptic curves .",

    "a generalized version of lazarsfeld s conjecture , involving property @xmath31 rather than simply @xmath0 , was proved in @xcite ; later in @xcite pareschi  popa were able to recover and improve pareschi s statements as a consequence of the powerful , fourier - mukai based , theory of @xmath45-regularity that they developed in @xcite .    given the results on projective normality and degree of defining equations of sasaki and khaled , it was natural to conjecture that a bound @xmath46 , _ independent of the dimension of @xmath2 _ , could be found such that @xmath42 satisfies @xmath31 for every @xmath47 .",

    "thanks to the geometric meaning of property @xmath31 ( section [ npekos ] ) one can deduce the following :    let be @xmath6 a very ample line bundle on a kummer variety @xmath2 .",
    "then the ideal of the image @xmath60 in @xmath61 is generated by forms of degree at most 4 .",
    "the improvement with respect to what was classically known , thanks to the work of wirtinger , andreotti  mayer @xcite and khaled ,",
    "is that this holds for all kummer varieties , and not only for the general ones",
    ". it might be interesting to see whether this fact has some applications to moduli of abelian varieties .",
    "adding one hypothesis about the line bundle @xmath6 we can get a somewhat better result improving the work of kempf and khaled ; namely :    let @xmath23 and @xmath26 be two integers such that @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath52 does not divide @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath6 be an ample line bundle on a kummer variety @xmath54 , such that its pullback @xmath64 with @xmath28 an ample symmetric invertible sheaf on @xmath1 which does not have a base divisor .",

    "more generally @xmath55 satisfies property @xmath31 for every @xmath36 such that @xmath66 .",

    "suppose that @xmath52 does not divide 2 or 3 and let @xmath6 be an ample invertible sheaf on @xmath54 such that @xmath67 with @xmath28 without a base divisor .",
    "then :    * if @xmath68 , then the ideal @xmath69 of the embedding @xmath70 is generated by quadrics ; * @xmath71 is generated by quadrics and cubics .    the key point of the proofs of theorems 2.a and 2.c will be to reduce the problem on the kummer variety @xmath2 to a different problem on the abelian variety @xmath1 . namely we will show that property @xmath31 on the kummer is implied by the surjectivity of a map of the type : @xmath72\\in\\w u}\\coo{0}{x}{\\f\\otimes\\alpha}\\otimes\\coo{0}{x}{\\fas{h}\\otimes\\alpha}\\stackrel{m_\\alpha}{\\rightarrow}\\coo{0}{x } { \\f\\otimes\\fas{h}\\otimes\\alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are sheaves on @xmath1 and @xmath75 is a non empty open subset of @xmath76 , the abelian variety dual to @xmath1 , and @xmath77 is just the multiplication of global sections .",
