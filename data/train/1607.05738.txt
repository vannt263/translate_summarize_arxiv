    "the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdc ) are in the focus of extensive investigations for several decades .",
    "although most of tmdc systems are nonmagnetic , they allow intercalation of magnetic @xmath3 elements , @xmath4 , ( see , e.g. review article @xcite ) leading to the formation of materials exhibiting a great variety of magnetic properties dependent on the host system , on the type and concentration of elements @xmath4 .",
    "some examples for this are the large magnetoresistance ( mr ) in fe@xmath5tas@xmath0 single crystal @xcite and the extremely high magnetic anisotropy and anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) in fe@xmath6tas@xmath0 @xcite recently discussed in the literature . in the present work",
    "we will focus on nbs@xmath0 intercalated with cr , mn , and fe . for the concentration 1/3 of the 3@xmath7 element , these systems exhibit the trend to the formation of an ordered compound , called in the literature either @xmath4nb@xmath8s@xmath9 or @xmath10nbs@xmath0 , with an @xmath11 arrangement of the @xmath4 atoms within the layer . if these compounds are magnetically ordered , they show a non - vanishing dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction because of the lack of inversion symmetry .",
    "this anisotropic exchange interaction is in particular responsible for the formation of a helimagnetic ( hm ) structure under normal conditions .",
    "however , an applied external magnetic field leads in some materials to the formation of a complicated magnetic texture as for example skyrmions having nontrivial topological properties @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it was observed that the compound cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 is a metallic ferromagnet , with a curie temperature @xmath12  k and a cr magnetic moment of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a similar magnitude for the magnetic moment was found also by miyadai et al.@xcite , while the curie temperature reported is somewhat smaller ( @xmath14  k ) . performing small - angle neutron diffraction measurements",
    ", these authors could give evidence for a long - period helimagnetic structure in cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 along the hexagonal @xmath2-axis , with cr magnetic moments lying within plane perpendicular to the @xmath2-axis .",
    "these results have been confirmed by other experimental groups by using lorentz microscopy and small - angle electron diffraction @xcite , as well as muon spin rotation and relaxation measurements @xcite .",
    "the experimental investigations using a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer @xcite demonstrated a transition from the commensurate to the incommensurate helimagnetic structure in the presence of a magnetic field directed perpendicular to the hexagonal @xmath2-axis . a similar bihaviour has also been found for mn@xmath1nbs@xmath0 , although no neutron scattering results are available so far that show explicitly the helimagnetic structure in mn@xmath1nbs@xmath0 .",
    "the transition from the helimagnetic structure to the state with an incommensurate chiral magnetic soliton lattice ( csl ) in cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath15 has been recently investigated by several groups @xcite .",
    "they have found that the size and number of magnetic domains in the csl state , having spin orientation along the magnetic field and separated by @xmath16 domain walls , can be easily manipulated by the magnetic field .",
    "this leads in particular to interesting transport properties in the system , such as a noticeable negative magneto - resistance ( mr ) along the chiral @xmath2 axis @xcite , observed in a wide range of temperature below the incommensurate - commensurate phase transition @xcite .",
    "togawa et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated ( using a combination of magneto - transport measurements and lorentz transmission electron microscopy ) the step - wise and hysteretic changes of the mr due to soliton confinement in a small cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 crystal with the csl .",
    "these properties make cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 attractive for spintronic applications .",
    "the fe@xmath1nbs@xmath0 compound , in contrast to cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 and mn@xmath1nbs@xmath0 , exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering with the nel temperature reported to be @xmath17  k @xcite , @xmath18  k @xcite , or @xmath19  k @xcite .",
    "the analysis of magnetic neutron scattering data @xcite as well as of mssbauer spectra @xcite suggest a collinear alignment of the fe magnetic moments along the hexagonal @xmath2-axis .",
    "so far , however , there are no theoretical investigations on the magnetic structure in this material .    in the present work we present a comparison of magnetic properties of cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 , mn@xmath1nbs@xmath0 and fe@xmath1nbs@xmath0 compounds , obtained within first principles calculations , demonstrating the importance of the relativistic effects for their magnetic properties and discuss the differences between the compounds .",
    "the present investigations on the magnetic properties of nbs@xmath0 intercalated with cr , mn , and fe are based on first - principles electronic structure calculations which have been performed using the fully relativistic kkr green function method @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been done in the framework of the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) to density functional theory ( dft ) using the parametrization for the exchange and correlation potential as given by vosko _",
    "_ @xcite . for the angular momentum expansion of the green function a cutoff of @xmath20 was applied .",
    "the magneto - crystalline anisotropy ( mca ) at @xmath21  k was investigated via first - principles calculations of the magnetic torque @xmath22 acting on the magnetic moment @xmath23 at atomic site @xmath24 and oriented along the direction of the total magnetization @xmath25 .",
    "the torque projection onto the direction @xmath26 , @xmath27 , having the form @xmath28 was calculated for @xmath29 ( assuming weak anisotropy within the plane perpendicular to the @xmath2 axis ) and @xmath30 , giving immediately the mca coefficient @xmath31 @xcite .    in the case of finite temperature ,",
    "@xmath32  k , the torque calculations for @xmath33 have been performed within the relativistic disorder local moment ( rdlm ) scheme as described by staunton , et al .",
    "@xcite .    in order to investigate the equilibrium magnetic structure and finite temperature magnetic properties of the compounds under consideration ,",
    "monte carlo simulations have been performed , which are based on the extended heisenberg model with the hamiltonian accounting for relativistic effects and represented by the following expression @xmath34 here @xmath31 is the uniaxial anisotropy constant and @xmath35 is the exchange coupling tensor representing the isotropic exchange interactions @xmath36 as well as the components of the dm interactions @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "within the present work we have used structural information taken from experiment @xcite . as it was pointed out in these works , the intercalated @xmath38nbs@xmath0 systems with @xmath39cr , mn , and fe exhibit at @xmath40 a @xmath41 superstructure within the @xmath4 layers , leading to a well defined ordered compound crystallizing in the space group p@xmath42 .",
    "this implies an occupation of the @xmath43 wyckoff positions ( with @xmath44 ) by s atoms , and occupation of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 ) positions by nb atoms . for the @xmath4 atoms , this symmetry group allows three possible positions : @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "experimental results , however , suggest the occupation of the @xmath49 position ( 1/3,2/3,1/4 ) to be most probable . in order to investigate the impact of the optimization of structure parameters via dft calculations",
    ", a corresponding optimization has been performed using the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the optimized structure parameters for the compounds with the @xmath4 atoms occupying the @xmath49 wyckoff positions are presented in table [ tab_struc ] together with the experimental data .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the case of fe@xmath1nbs@xmath0 , first of all , the isotropic exchange interaction between the first and second neighbors are negative making their antiparallel alignment preferable . however , due to the hexagonal crystal structure , a competition of the afm interactions between the neighboring atoms results in a frustrated non - collinear magnetic structure in the system",
    "[ fig : mag_fenbs2_2](a ) represents the magnetic structure obtained within the mc simulations ( @xmath51  k ) neglecting dm interactions",
    ". although the @xmath52 components of the dm vectors are much smaller than two others , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the dm interactions result in the formation of a chiral spin - spiral structure in fe@xmath1nbs@xmath0 along @xmath55 , @xmath56 as well as @xmath57 directions with a rotation angle of @xmath58 between neighboring atoms along each direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_fenbs2_2](b ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that in experiment @xcite a collinear ferrimagnetic structure is formed for fe@xmath1nbs@xmath0 , in contradiction to the present calculations .",
    "a reason for this discrepancy may be attributed to the magnetic anisotropy along the hexagonal @xmath2 axis , which has not been taken into account within the calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_fenbs2_2](a ) and ( b ) . according to the mc simulations based on the heisenberg model , the calculated @xmath31 parameter for the magnetic anisotropy represented in table [ tab_mom ]",
    ", @xmath59  mev/(fe atom ) , is still too small to force the system to a collinear state .",
    "however , imposing a stronger mca with @xmath60  mev/(fe atom ) , the magnetic moments are almost perfectly aligned along the @xmath2 axis , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_fenbs2_2](c ) .",
    "note that the latter results were obtained for the temperature 4  k , to follow the experimental conditions @xcite , leading to a finite amplitude of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the magnetic structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_fenbs2_2](c ) with the so - called ordering of the third kind @xcite , is in full agreement with experiment .",
    "this implies an antiferromagnetic ordering of each fe atom with its 12 neighbors such that four of them have their magnetic moments in the same direction and the other 8 atoms in the opposite direction , as a result of the competition of their afm exchange coupling and uniaxial mca along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "although , no experimental results on the mca are available , the present results allow us to conclude about the underestimated mca in our calculations , as it was already shown for cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 . despite this",
    ", one can see rather good agreement between theory and experiment , that gives access to the understanding of the origin of magnetic structures and magnetic properties of the systems under consideration .",

    "the fm interactions , finite values of the @xmath52 interaction terms and the in - plane mca in cr@xmath1nbs@xmath0 lead to a helimagnetic structure along the hexagonal @xmath2 axis , in full agreement with experiment .",

    "no direct experimental observation of the hm structure in mn@xmath1nbs@xmath0 has been done so far , that can be attributed to its long period due to oscillating behaviour of the dm interactions with a distance . in the case of the fe@xmath1nbs@xmath0 compound , a frustrated non - collinear magnetic structure has been found in the present calculations when the mca is neglected .",
    "however , a strong mca along the hexagonal @xmath2 axis leads to the magnetic structure referred to as an ordering of the third kind , being a consequence of a modification of the frustrated non - collinear magnetic structure in the presence of strong mca .",
