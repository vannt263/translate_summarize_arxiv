    "[ [ mechanism - for - the - spectral - break ] ] mechanism for the spectral break + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the physics of the spectral break is very simple .",
    "when a snr shock approaches a molecular cloud ( mc ) or a pre - supernova swept - up shell , confinement of accelerated particles generally deteriorates . due to the particle interaction with magnetic turbulence , confinement requires scales similar to the particle gyroradius @xcite .",
    "while the waves are in a strongly ionized ( closer to the shock ) medium they propagate freely in a broad frequency range at the alfven speed @xmath5 with the frequencies @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the wave number ( assumed parallel to the local field @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 is the ion mass density .",
    "as long as the alfven wave frequency is higher than the ion - neutral collision frequency @xmath10 , the waves are weakly damped .",
    "when , on the other hand , the ion - neutral collision frequency is higher ( deeper into the cloud ) , neutrals are entrained by the oscillating plasma and the alfven waves are also able to propagate , albeit with a factor @xmath11 lower speed , where @xmath12 is the neutral density .",
    "the propagation speed reduction occurs because every ion is now `` loaded '' with @xmath13 neutrals . in between these two regimes alfven waves are heavily damped and even disappear altogether for sufficiently small @xmath14 .",
    "the evanescence wave number range is then bounded by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these phenomena have been studied in detail in @xcite , and specifically in the context of the dsa in @xcite .",
    "now we turn to their impact on the particle confinement and emissivity .    in the frame work of a quasilinear wave - particle interaction",
    "the wave number @xmath7 is approximately related to the parallel ( to the magnetic field ) component of the particle momentum @xmath17 by the cyclotron resonance condition @xmath18 where the ( non - relativistic ) gyro - frequency @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the frequency range where the waves can not propagate may be conveniently translated into the parallel momentum range    @xmath20    with    @xmath21    that a spectral break must form at the photon energy corresponding to the particle momentum @xmath22 , can be readily understood from fig.[fig : scattering - zone - of ] .",
    "the dead zones @xmath23 imply that particles with @xmath24 do not turn around ( while moving along the magnetic field ) and escape from the region of cr - dense gas collisions at a @xmath25 fraction of the speed of light .",
    "this happens in the region of enhanced gamma radiation .",
    "therefore , an initially isotropic distribution of accelerated particles fills only a slab in momentum space @xmath26 and becomes highly anisotropic ( a pancake distribution ) .",
    "what matters for the integral emission , however , is a locally isotropic component @xmath27 of this new proton distribution .",
    "it can be introduced by re - averaging the pancake ( @xmath26 ) distribution in pitch angle , @xmath28 , and is readily obtained assuming that particles remaining in the dense gas ( those with @xmath26 ) maintain their isotropic pitch - angle distribution , i.e.    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the initial ( isotropic ) distribution function and @xmath31 is the cosine of the pitch angle ( see fig.[fig : scattering - zone - of ] ) , @xmath32 . thus , the slope of the particle momentum distribution becomes steeper by exactly one power above @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , any power - law distribution @xmath34 , upon entering an mc , turns into @xmath35 at @xmath36 , and preserves its form at @xmath37 .",
    "now the question is whether particle escape from the mc can quench the acceleration process itself . in principle",
    "it can , since also the particles from the interval @xmath26 can not return to the shock and continue acceleration . instead , by slowly leaking to the part of the momentum space with @xmath24 , they should ultimately escape as well .",
    "this would certainly be the case if the mc were filling the entire shock precursor .",
    "however , mcs are known to be clumpy @xcite , and may fill only a small fraction of the precursor . in this case",
    "the acceleration process continues almost unimpeded , the accelerated protons illuminate the cloudlets and make them visible in @xmath38-rays due to the high density target material .    [",
    "[ break - momentum ] ] break momentum + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    while the one power spectral break in the pitch - angle averaged particle distribution seems to be a robust environmental signature of a weakly ionized medium into which the accelerated particles propagate , the break momentum remains uncertain . according to eq.([eq : p12 ] ) , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) depends on the magnetic field strength and ion density as well as on the frequency of ion - neutral collisions , @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 is the product of the collision cross - section and collision velocity averaged over the thermal distribution . using an approximation of @xcite for @xmath42",
    ", @xmath39 can be estimated as @xmath43 here the gas temperature @xmath44 is measured in the units of @xmath45 , magnetic field",
    "@xmath46 -in microgauss , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( number densities corresponding to the neutral / ion mass densities @xmath12 and @xmath9 ) -in @xmath49 . note that the numerical coefficient in the last expression may vary depending on the average ion and neutral masses and can be higher by a factor of a few for typical molecular cloud conditions @xcite than the estimate in eq.([eq : p1 ] ) suggests .",
    "the remaining quantities in the last formula are also known too poorly to make an accurate independent prediction of the position of the break in the gamma ray emission region .",
    "those are the regions near the blast wave where complicated physical processes unfold .",
    "they include particle acceleration , strong mhd turbulence ( driven by particles and their interaction with ambient gas inhomogeneities ) , gas ionization by shock generated uv photons , turbulent plasma heating and even evaporation of magnetic cloudlets @xcite .",
    "also important may be the ionization by the low energy crs accelerated at the blast wave .",
    "however , as their diffusion length is shorter than that of the particles with @xmath50 , we may assume that they do not reach the mc .",
    "pre - ionization by the uv photons can also be ignored for the column density @xmath51 ahead of the shock beyond which they are absorbed @xcite .",
    "the authors or the ref .",
    "@xcite , using the earlier data from @xcite have also analyzed the parameters involved in eq.([eq : p1 ] ) and found the above estimate of @xmath39 to be in a good agreement with the spectral break position measured by the _",
    "nevertheless , we may run the argument in reverse and use the _ fermi _ observations @xcite of the gamma - ray spectrum of snr w44 to determine the break momentum in the parent particle spectrum and constrain the parameters in eq.([eq : p1 ] ) .",
    "once we also know the amount of the slope variation @xmath52 , we can calculate the full spectrum up to the cut - off energy .",
    "[ [ particle - spectra ] ] particle spectra + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to calculate the particle spectra , we need to determine the degree of nonlinear modification of the shock structure . in principle , it can be calculated consistently , given the shock parameters and the particle maximum momentum , @xmath53 .",
    "in the case of a broken spectrum , @xmath39 plays the role of @xmath53 , since this is the momentum where the dominant contribution to the pressure of accelerated particles comes from , thus setting the scale of the modified shock precursor .",
    "note that in the conventional nonlinear ( nl ) acceleration theory , the cut - off momentum @xmath53 plays this role , because the nonlinear spectra are sufficiently flat so as to make the pressure diverge with momentum .",
    "the break in the photon spectrum is observed at about @xmath54 gev , which places the break on the proton distribution at about @xmath55 @xcite . for the strength of the break @xmath56 ,",
    "the spectrum above it is clearly pressure converging , and we perform the calculation of the shock structure and the spectrum using this break momentum as the point of the maximum in the cr partial pressure .",
    "once this point is set , we can use an analytic approach for a stationary nonlinear acceleration problem using @xmath39 as an input parameter .",
    "apart from @xmath39 , the nonlinear solution depends on a number of other parameters , such as the injection rate of thermal particles into acceleration , mach number , the precursor heating rate and the shock velocity @xmath57 . of these parameters only the latter",
    "is known accurately , @xmath58 , the other parameters are still difficult to ascertain .",
    "fortunately , in sufficiently strong shocks the solution generally tends to either stay close to the test particle ( tp ) solution ( leaving the shock structure only weakly modified ) or else it transitions to a strongly modified nl - solution regime .",
    "the tp regime typically establishes in cases of moderate mach numbers , low injection rates and low @xmath53 ( now @xmath39 ) , while the nl regime is unavoidable in the opposite part of the parameter space .    in the tp regime",
    "the spectrum is close to a power - law with the spectral index 2 throughout the supra - thermal energy range . in the nl regime , however , the spectrum develops a concave form , starting from a softer spectrum at the injection energy , with the index @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the sub - shock compression ratio",
    ". then it hardens , primarily in the region @xmath61 , where both the partial pressure and diffusivity of protons change their momentum scaling .",
    "the slope reaches its minimum at the cut - off ( break ) energy , which , depending on the degree of nonlinearity , can be as low as 1.5 or even somewhat lower if the cut - off is abrupt .",
    "the question now is into which of these two categories the w44 spectrum falls ?",
    "generally , in cases of low maximum ( or , equivalently , low spectral break @xmath62 ) momentum , the shock modification is weak , so the spectrum is more likely to be in the only slightly nonlinear , almost tp regime . on the other hand",
    ", there is a putative indication from the electron radio emission that their spectrum may be close to @xmath63 , which could be the signature of a moderately nonlinear acceleration process .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that this is a global index across the w44 remnant .",
    "there are resolved bright filaments where a canonical @xmath64 spectrum , corresponding precisely to the tp parent electron spectrum with @xmath65 is observed @xcite . moreover , there are regions with the positive indices @xmath66 which can not be indicative of a dsa process without corrections for subsequent spectral transformations such as an absorption by thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "these regions can very well contribute to the overall spectral hardening discussed above , mimicking the acceleration nonlinearity .",
    "finally , secondary electrons give rise to the flattening of the radio spectrum as well @xcite .",
    "if the accelerated protons and electrons respond to the turbulence similarly , which is almost certainly the case in the ultra - relativistic regime , their spectra should have similar slopes there ( as long as the synchrotron losses are ignorable ) . in using the electron radio spectrum as a probe for the level of acceleration nonlinearity ,",
    "the following two relations are useful .",
    "first , there is a relation between the electron energy and the radio frequency @xmath67 .",
    "the second relation , @xmath68 , links the spectral index of radio emission @xmath69 ( assuming the radio flux @xmath70 ) and the spectral index of the parent electrons @xmath71 ( assuming their energy spectrum @xmath72 ) .",
    "once the global radio spectral index of w44 , @xmath73 @xcite is generated by freshly accelerated electrons in the frequency range @xmath74 mhz , the electrons should maintain their modified spectrum over the energy range spanning more than one order of magnitude .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath75 @xcite , one sees that electrons must maintain an index @xmath63 between @xmath76 gev .",
    "while the upper bound is acceptable given the spectral break proton energy inferred from the super gev emission measured by the fermi lat , the lower end is rather uncomfortable , since the nonlinear modification of both protons and electrons with the bohm ( or other similar for protons and electrons turbulent diffusivities ) starts ( slowly ) only at the proton rest energy .",
    "the calculated nonlinear spectra are shown in fig.[fig : spectra - of - protons ] for the both species . at and below @xmath77gev ,",
    "the electron spectrum is very close to the test particle solution , @xmath78 even though the proton spectrum may be somewhat steeper there , as we mentioned above .",
    "[ [ photon - spectra ] ] photon spectra + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the above considerations somewhat weaken the radio data as a probe for the slope of the electron and ( more importantly ) for the proton spectrum .",
    "therefore , the exact degree of nonlinearity of the acceleration remains unknown and we consider both the tp and weakly nl regimes in our calculations of the photon spectra , generated in @xmath79 collisions .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : gamma - emission - from ] .",
    "the best fit to the fermi data is provided by a tp energy distribution ( @xmath0 ) below @xmath80gev / c with the spectrum steepening by exactly one power above it .",
    "note that the small deviation of the computed spectrum from the lowest energy _",
    "_ fermi-__point may also be corrected by including the bremsstrahlung of the secondary electrons @xcite .",
    "the spectrum steepening is perfectly consistent with the proton partial escape described above ( with no parameters involved ) and shown in fig.[fig : scattering - zone - of ] . for comparison , a weakly nl spectrum , shown in fig.[fig : spectra - of - protons ] ,",
    "is also used for these calculations ( dashed line in fig.[fig : gamma - emission - from ] ) , but its fit would require a stronger break ( @xmath81 ) or a low momentum cut - off , fig.[fig : gamma - emission - from ] , i.e. at least one additional free parameter .",
    "to summarize the results , the previously suggested mechanism for a break on the spectrum of shock accelerated protons @xcite is found consistent with the recent @xcite fermi lat observations of the snr w44 .",
    "the observed gamma ray spectrum most likely results from the decay of @xmath82-mesons which are born in @xmath79 collisions of shock accelerated protons with an ambient dense gas .",
    "the parent proton spectrum is best represented by a classical test particle power law @xmath0 , steepening to @xmath1 at @xmath2 due to deteriorated particle confinement caused by the ion - neutral collisions and the resultant alfven wave evanescence .",
    "the position of the break momentum in the particle spectrum may be estimated using eq.([eq : p1 ] ) , or conversely , the combination of parameters involved in this estimate can be inferred from the measured break momentum .",
    "the cut - off momentum is not constrained in this scenario .",
    "an alternative explanation , based on a different mechanism of the break , associated with the change of the particle transport in the cr shock precursor @xcite is also possible but is less definitive in the spectrum slope variation @xmath52 across the break ( see also @xcite for the most recent alternative suggestions ) .",
    "in addition , the ref @xcite mechanism would imply a considerable nonlinearity , i.e. a stronger cr shock precursor than it seems appropriate for the observed low break momentum . still alternatively , assuming our `` environmental '' break mechanism is at work , i.e. @xmath56 , but the shock structure appreciably modified , we arrive at the @xmath83 spectrum below the break ( as the radio observations suggest for the electrons ) , and @xmath84 above the break",
    ". a fit to the data is marginally possible , but it would require a relatively low cut - off momentum at about @xmath85 gev / c",
    ". this possibility may be supported or ruled out once the data ( upper limit ) around this energy become available .",
    "the most robust and attractive aspect of the suggested mechanism for the spectral break is the exact @xmath56 variation of the spectral index .",
    "indeed , this change in the spectral slope is due to truncation of the particle momentum phase space and does not depend on any parameters . in a combination with the test particle regime operating below the break , which is consistent with the low value of the break momentum",
    ", it provides a very good fit to the _ fermi _ lat data .",
    "of three physically different types of spectral breaks suggested earlier @xcite , namely the current , `` environmental '' mechanism appears to be plausible in situations where dense target gas is present , as required for efficient @xmath82 production . in a more general context ,",
    "a spectral break is a natural resolution of the well known but puzzling trend of the _ nonlinear _ ( i.e. supposedly improved ) dsa theory to develop spectra which are even harder than the simple test particle spectra , thus encountering more difficulties while accommodating the bulk of observations @xcite .",
    "such a spectrum ",
    "i.e. , diverging in energy exhausts the shock energy available for the acceleration as the cut - off momentum grows .",
    "note , that the spectrum of the rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite is also consistent with the same break mechanism but with @xmath86 and with naturally stronger acceleration nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to make the case for hadronic origin of the gamma - ray emission of the rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite .",
    "the fundamental role of the w44 for the problem of cr origin is that this particular remnant seems to rule out contaminating electron emission due to bremsstrahlung and the inverse compton scattering @xcite thus favoring the hadronic origin of the gamma emission .",

    "<S> it is possible , however , that a somewhat steeper power - law would better accommodate the @xmath3 measured spectrum @xcite ( see also the discussion section below ) , even though this difference can be attributed to cr propagation losses ( also not completely certain ) . </S>",

    "<S> the simple dsa prediction was even used as an argument against the hadronic origin of the gamma emission on the ground that if the high energy part of the spectrum was extrapolated ( with the dsa index 2 ) to lower energies , the emission there would be unacceptably high , e.g. @xcite . motivated by this inconsistency with the dsa theory in particular , </S>",
