    "there are currently more than fiffty extrasolar planets with published secondary eclipse measurements ( e.g. , knutson et al . 2010 ) , with many more observations taken but not yet published .",
    "these data come from both space and ground - based facilities , and span wavelengths ranging from the visible to the mid - infrared .",
    "the combination of data from multiple telescopes spanning a broad range of wavelengths offers an invaluable tool for constraining the pressure - temperature profiles and compositions of exoplanetary atmospheres . with an increasingly larger sample of spectra , we can begin to understand the underlying physical and chemical processes that control the atmospheric abundances through comparative exoplanetology .",
    "there are several interesting questions that we might address through a comparative study of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "one is the frequency of planets with super - solar c to o ratios .",
    "the c to o ratio can potentially provide constraints on the region of the disk where the planet formed ( berg , murray - clay , & bergin 2011 ; madhusudhan et al .",
    "these studies propose that planets that accrete their gas envelopes outside of the water snow line will have modestly super - stellar c to o ratios , which increase to even higher values for planets that form beyond the co@xmath0 ice line ( berg , murray - clay , & bergin 2011 ) .    a uniform analysis of hot jupiter atmospheres",
    "can also be used to investigate the origin of the temperature inversions detected in a subset of these planets .",
    "it has been suggested ( hubeny et al .",
    "2003 ; fortney et al . 2008 ) that gas - phase tio and vo , which are effective absorbers at optical wavelengths , could lead to the formation of temperature inversions in these atmospheres .",
    "tio and vo thermochemically exist in the gas phase in hotter planets ( @xmath2 k ) .",
    "therefore , one would expect thermal inversions to be limited to planets that are hot enough to have gas phase tio in their upper atmospheres .",
    "however , in a more recent study spiegel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested that vigorous vertical mixing is required to keep both gas phase and condensed phase tio and vo aloft in upper , inversion forming regions of the atmosphere .",
    "showman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and parmentier , showman & lian ( 2013 ) demonstrated that tio could be severely depleted due to cold traps in the deep atmosphere and on the planet s night side .",
    "furthermore , should tio and vo persist despite the aforementioned reasons , knutson et al .",
    "( 2010 ) speculated that high amounts of uv flux from active stars might dissociate tio and vo .",
    "recently madhusudhan ( 2012 ) proposed that the abundances of tio and vo could be significantly depleted if the atmosphere has a super - solar c to o ratio . in this paper",
    "we use a uniform retrieval analysis to determine if there is a correlation between the presence or absence of a temperature inversion , the c to o ratio of the planet s atmosphere , and the activity level of its host star .    in paper i ( line et al .",
    "2013 ) we developed a suite of inverse modeling algorithms , called chimera , to determine the ranges of temperatures and compositions that were consistent with a given data set .",
    "chimera uses three bayesian retrieval approaches including optimal estimation , bootstrap monte carlo , and differential evolution markov chain monte carlo to determine the allowable ranges of temperatures and abundances for a given planet . in this investigation",
    "we apply chimera to nine planets in order to undertake the first uniform ( meaning we use the same model , model assumptions , and retrieval approaches for each object ) retrieval analysis of a set of exoplanet spectra .",
    "our uniform analysis allows us to make robust comparisons between planets , as we utilize the same model parameters and retrieval techniques for each target . comparing results derived from different retrieval approaches or different models",
    "can be complicated due to the differing model assumptions .",
    "such an analysis can also provide a useful set of statistical atmospheric properties from which detailed physical models such as general circulation models , photochemical models , and radiative equilibrium models can be compared .",
    "our goal in this study is to provide a catalogue of temperatures and abundances for nine well - observed planets and to address some of the outstanding questions regarding c to o ratios and the possible causes of thermal inversions .",
    "our sample includes the following planets : hd189733b , hd209458b , gj436b , hd149026b , wasp-12b , wasp-19b , wasp-43b , tres-2b , and tres-3b .",
    "these planets were selected because they span a wide range of physical parameters with a reasonably high number of spectral data points per planet . in  [ sec : methods ] we will describe the retrieval approaches and forward model assumptions .",
    "the details of our approach can be found in paper i. in  [ sec : analysis ] we present our temperature and abundance retrieval results for each of the nine planets and compare them to previously published analyses .",
    "we then use the derived abundances to asses the allowed range of c to o ratios and comment on the implications of these results for current hypotheses for the origin of temperature inversions on these planets . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we will discuss the big picture view from our retrieval results , which show little evidence for c to o ratios larger than one .",
    "we summarize our retrieval methods and forward models here and refer the reader to paper i for more detailed descriptions .",
    "the goal of a retrieval , given some forward model , is to characterize the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of interest , in this case , temperatures and abundances via a radiative transfer model .",
    "this posterior is determined from a combination of prior information and the data .",
    "paper i describes three approaches that are commonly used to characterize posterior distributions .",
    "these include : optimal estimation ( oe , e.g. , rodgers 2000 ) , bootstrap monte carlo ( bmc , press 1992 ; ford 2005 ) , and differential evolution markov chain monte carlo ( demc , ter braak 2006 ) .",
    "optimal estimation minimizes a quadratic cost function using the levenberg - marquardt scheme and approximates the posterior as multivariate normal .",
    "bootstrap monte carlo uses a data resampling method based on a best - fit model to derive the parameter distributions .",
    "differential evolution markov chain monte carlo is a type of markov chain monte carlo approach ( mcmc ) which uses a genetic algorithm to efficiently explore highly correlated parameter spaces .",
    "demc and oe both evaluate the following log - likliehood function : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the set of @xmath5 data points , @xmath6 is the @xmath7-dimensional parameter vector , @xmath8 is the forward model , and @xmath9 is the @xmath10 data error matrix .",
    "@xmath11 is the _ a priori _ state vector and @xmath12 is the @xmath13 _ a priori _ covariance matrix .",
    "the first term in equation [ eq : cost_func ] is simply the standard  chi - squared \" and the second term represents the prior knowledge of the parameter distribution before we make the observations .",
    "in paper i we determined that the three approaches agree for high signal - to - noise , high - resolution data , but diverge for the data sets currently available for typical hot jupiters .",
    "we also found that oe and demc tended to agree better than the bmc , and that our implementation of bmc was only able to characterize the probability distribution in the region very close to the nominal solution .",
    "therefore , in this investigation we utilize the oe and demc approaches to estimate the posterior probability distributions of the temperatures and abundances .",
    "we use the results from oe to initialize the demc as described in paper i. by using two distinct approaches , we can determine whether or not our results are sensitive to our choice of fitting method .",
    "we present results from the demc approach in our final abundance catalogue , as this is the more widely accepted , robust approach for current exoplanet data ( e.g , benneke & seager 2012 ; line et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the physical parameters we are most interested in are the temperature structure and the mole fractions of various gases .",
    "we therefore choose to retrieve vertically uniform mixing ratios of h@xmath0o , ch@xmath1 , co , and co@xmath0 . these are generally the most thermochemically abundant ( with the exception of co@xmath0 ) and infrared active species over the observational bandpasses for a variety of metallicities and c / o ratios .",
    "furthermore these species tend to have the most complete line lists either via experimentation or _",
    "ab initio _ modeling ( see part i for description of our line lists ) .",
    "we have assumed vertically uniform because the data do not provide useful constraints on the vertical abundance profile ( lee et al .",
    "also , the species of interest in this case , when abundant , thermochemically have near vertically uniform profiles to begin with , and vertical mixing tends to quench minor species resulting in vertically uniform profiles ( moses et al .",
    "2011 ; line et al .",
    "we note that we have not included other potentially important absorbers such as nh@xmath14 cross - section data base .",
    "we do not expect the lack of nh@xmath14 to have a significant impact on our retrievals because strong absorption is mainly limited to the 10 @xmath15 m region and hence should not introduce strong correlations with the other absorbers .",
    "] , hcn , h@xmath0s , c@xmath0h@xmath0 , as accurate line - lists at high temperatures do not yet exist ( to the best of our knowledge ) .",
    "we plan to expand the scope of our future retrievals as more reliable sepctroscopic databases become available , and as improvements in the observations justify the inclusion of additional gases .",
    "we also assume that these planets are hydrogen dominated and hence fix the h@xmath0 and he mixing ratios to thermochemically appropriate abundances of 0.85 and 0.15 , respectively , which hold over a wide range of temperatures and metallicities .",
    "there could also be other optically inactive species such as n@xmath0 , o@xmath0 , noble gases other than he , etc . , but these molecules would have a minimal impact on the shape of our retrieved emission spectra and we therefore do not include them in our fits .",
    "the retrievable species are assumed to have mole fractions much much less than that of h@xmath0 , therefore we do not include mean molecular weight effects on the spectrum .",
    "we neglect to consider clouds in our models for the same reasons discussed madhusudhan & seager ( 2009 ) .",
    "furthermore , fortney et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that many cloud species ( minor condensates and photochemical hazes ) will have small normal optical depths resulting in minimal impact on emission spectra .",
    "this idea is supported by recent findings that , though hd189733b ( pont et al . ( ) ) and gj436b ( knutson et al .",
    "( 2014 ) ) show strong evidence for high altitude absorbers in transmission , these planets still show strong signs of absorption in the emission spectra",
    ". however , given the mounting evidence for clouds in primary eclipse , it is perhaps worth investigating the impacts of clouds on emission spectra in the future .    in paper",
    "i we described two temperature retrieval approaches : the level - by - level approach and the parametrized approach . for this analysis",
    "we choose to use the parametrized temperature profile approach .",
    "the limited number of data points per planet limits the practicality of a full level - by - level retrieval .",
    "the parameterization we use is based on analytic radiative equilibrium profiles ( see guillot 2010 ; heng et al .",
    "2012 ; robinson & catling 2012 ) controlled by 5 free parameters .",
    "these parameters are the infrared opacity , two visible opacities , partitioning of the two opacity streams , and a catch - all factor for the albedo , emissivity , and redistribution .",
    "this last parameter effectively accounts for energy balance at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "we do not try to self - consistently relate the temperatures back to the composition for reasons discussed in paper i. once we have determine the uncertainty distributions for each of the five temperature profile parameters , we can then reconstruct the ensemble of temperature profiles .",
    "our priors are the same as those described in paper i. when using the optimal estimation formalism , by construction , the priors are gaussian .",
    "we choose very broad ( 12 orders - of - magnitude spanning the 68% confidence interval ) gas priors .",
    "this mitigates the effect of the prior on the gas abundance retrievals .",
    "we also choose broad gaussian priors on the 5 parameters governing the parametrized temperature profile . when using demc we choose flat gas priors , but use gaussian priors on the temperature parameters .",
    "these produce a spread in the reconstructed temperature profiles that is more consistent with numerical radiative equilibrium models than a flat prior would . for any mcmc search when using flat priors one must impose limits in order to prevent the random walk process from venturing too far from useful phase space .",
    "we choose a lower limit mixing ratio of 10@xmath16 and an upper limit of 0.1 .",
    "although somewhat arbitrary , we would expect the molecular abundances of these four species to fall well within these limits .",
    "we obtain the planet and system parameters ( stellar radius , planet radius , stellar temperature , semimajor axis , planet gravity ) from the published literature ( see table [ tab : table0 ] ) .",
    "these parameters are used in generating the parameterized temperature profile and when dividing by the stellar grid models .",
    "we use interpolated ( logg , fe / h , and teff ) phoenix stellar grid models ( allard et al . 2000 ) to compute the contrast spectrum .",
    "we also should note that the retrieval results presented here must be taken in the context of our particular model . though not likely to change significantly , the retrieval abundances for the molecules presented here may change if we included a larger or different set of molecules .",
    "it is worth investigating the impact of different molecules on our retrieval results through a nested model comparison in a future investigation , similar to the one presented in swain et al .",
    "in this section we provide a catalogue of abundances and temperatures for nine planets observed in secondary eclipse .",
    "the sources of the secondary eclipse data are shown in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "we provide detailed descriptions of the results for each planet in our sample and compare these results to those of previous investigations .",
    "graphical results of the retrievals are summarized in figures [ fig : figure1]-[fig : figure3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows the secondary eclipse observations , the best fit spectra , and a statistical summary of all of the fits from the demc retrieval .",
    "these fits are summarized with 68@xmath17 and 95@xmath17 confidence bounds along with a median spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2 ] shows the temperature profiles summarized with 68@xmath17 and 95@xmath17 confidence bounds , a median profile , and a best fit .",
    "we also show the averaged thermal emission contribution function to get a sense for which pressure levels the observations probe . for comparative curiosity",
    "we show , in some cases , self - consistent first - principle temperature profiles from the literature .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : figure3 ] shows the marginalized gas abundance posteriors for each planet along with the imposed priors ( flat for demc , gaussian for oe ) .",
    "we use the resulting retrieval results to derive the c to o ratio probability distributions in figure [ fig : figure4 ] .",
    "these distributions generally have a double - peaked structure , which is the manifestation of the uniform abundance priors in the c to o distribution ( see paper i for a detailed discussion of this issue ) . rather than showing the two peaked c to o distribution resulting from the prior and posterior together ,",
    "we normalize the posterior derived c / o distribution by the double - peaked prior c / o distribution to give us a sense for how the data contributed to our knowledge of the c to o ratio .",
    "this has no formal statistical meaning , but it provides a clear visual representation of the information provided by the observations independent of the assumed priors .",
    "we also include a table ( table [ tab : table2 ] ) comparing our numerical results to those of previous studies for easy reference .",
    "we provide our 68@xmath17 confidence intervals for the molecular mixing ratios along with the nominal best - fit values derived from demc .",
    "we also report the reduced cost function value from equation [ eq : cost_func ] , @xmath18 for the best fit , where n is the number of data points .",
    "a @xmath18of one suggests that the model on average fits the data within the 1-sigma error bars ( just as in madhusudhan & seager 2009 ) .",
    "since we place limits on the flat gas priors used in the demc retrieval , we must interpret the retrieved abundance range in the context of those limits .",
    "given those limits , the 68@xmath17 confidence interval from the flat gas prior would result in abundances that span @xmath19 , or @xmath208 orders of magnitude .",
    "anything smaller than this suggests that the data was informative within the context of our model .",
    "furthermore , we quote the 68@xmath17 confidence interval for the c / o ratios derived from our abundance retrievals . these values are computed directly from the posterior c to o distributions , not the normalized - by - prior distribution shown in figure [ fig : figure4 ] .",
    "given the imposed abundance limits , the 68@xmath17 confidence interval in the c / o distribution resulting from the uniform gas priors is @xmath21 , or @xmath20 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "together with hd209458b , hd189733b is one of the best - studied hot jupiters to date .",
    "this is because it orbits a bright , nearby k star with a favorable planet - star radius ratio .",
    "secondary eclipse observations have been made with a variety of instruments including hst - nicmos ( swain et al . 2009 ) , spitzer irac ( deming et al .",

    "several previous retrieval investigations have constrained the range of allowable temperature structures and compositions for this atmosphere .",
    "the first complete study via a systematic parametric grid search was published by madhusudhan & seager ( 2009 ) .",
    "the composition they derived was high ( relative to a solar composition atmosphere ) in co@xmath0 and co followed by low abundances of ch@xmath1 and a moderate abundance of h@xmath0o .",

    "2010 ; moses et al . 2011 ; 2013a ) .",
    "there is also no evidence for a thermal inversion .",
    "our abundances are generally consistent with the previous results to within an order of magnitude",
    ". however , not all of the previous investigations are consistent .",
    "for instance , all of the results for hd189733b in table [ tab : table2 ] , including ours , require an anomalously high abundance of co@xmath0 aside from the analysis presented in swain et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( see shabram et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for a more detailed discussion of this discrepancy ) . also , the upper limit on ch@xmath1 quoted by line et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is much higher than the limits from previous studies .",
    "this is likely due to the problems associated with using optimal estimation in data regimes in which the resulting posterior probability distributions are non - gaussian .",
    "we note that the data used in the retrievals were not the same in all cases .",
    "we simultaneously retrieved the abundances and temperatures using a combination of data including the nicmos , irs , and spitzer photometry .",
    "madhusudhan & seager ( 2009 ) considered these data sets separately .",
    "swain et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and line et al .",
    "( 2012 ) only considered the nicmos data set .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2012 ) considered all available data sets .",
    "it is worth considering whether individual data sets give consistent results , as data taken at different epochs could vary as a result of stellar variability , differences in detector systematics , etc . despite these differences the results of all of these studies",
    "are in generally good agreement , suggesting that our conclusions for this planet are reasonably robust .    in our new study",
    "we find an enhanced best fit c / o ratio of 0.85 ( 0.47 - 0.90 ) , well within the range quoted by previous investigations .",
    "this is a fairly robust result relative to the prior ( see figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) .",
    "the large number of spitzer irs data points that have thermal emission weighting functions near the 10 mbar level combined with our requirement of radiative equilibrium via the analytic parameterization , provide a well constrained temperature profile above the 0.1 bar level .",
    "below this level the temperature profile begins to diverge because very little emission is able to escape from these deeper regions of the atmosphere .",
    "our derived spread in profiles in the well - constrained regime between 10 - 100 mbar is in agreement with the profile derived in lee et al .",
    "we also show a temperature profile from moses et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which is generally cooler than our derived spread .",
    "hd209458b is also a favorable target for secondary eclipse observations due to its relatively deep eclipse depths and bright host star .",
    "multiple groups have obtained secondary eclipse observations using broadband photometry ( cowan et al . 2007 ; knutson et al . 2008 ; crossfield et al .",
    "2012a ) , nicmos spectroscopy",
    "( swain et al .",
    "2009b ) , and spitzer irs spectroscopy ( richardson et al . 2007 ; swain et al .",
    "the consensus from these observations is that this planet possesses a strong thermal inversion ( burrows et al .",
    "2007 ; madhusudhan & seager 2009 ; swain et al . 2009 ) and poor day - night heat redistribution ( cowan et al . 2007 ) .",
    "madhusudhan & seager ( 2009 ) used spitzer photometry to constrain the range of allowable dayside temperature profiles and compositions .",
    "their ensemble of fits suggest a strong thermal inversion beginning near the @xmath20500 mbar level and a high c / o ratio . however , they point out that simple 1-dimensional dayside averaged profiles may result in over - interpretation of the data . combining nicmos and irs spectroscopy with spitzer broadband photometry , swain et al .",
    "( 2009 ) salso found that a thermal inversion is needed to explain the combined observations .",
    "they also placed some limited constraints on the molecular abundances .",
    "our independent analysis focuses on the broadband data only .",
    "we are unable to simultaneously fit the nicmos / irs spectroscopy and the spitzer photometry with a single model that provides a good match to all of the observations .",
    "our best fits including both data sets generally result in reduced @xmath22 values greater than 5 , and hence such solutions may not be statistically meaningful . our broadband retrieval confirms the existence of a strong ( median inversion depth - to - error at the temperature minimum of 7.5 , or 7.5@xmath23 ) thermal inversion with the temperature minimum occurring within the 1bar -100 mbar region .",
    "this tropopause location is consistent with tropopause locations in our own solar system and with what is predicted by robinson & catling ( 2013 ) , but is somewhat deeper than what is shown in moses et al .",
    "we also find c to o ratios near unity .",
    "the inversion is needed to explain the high 4.5 and 5.7 @xmath15 m fluxes relative to the other points .",
    "this is also the location of the strong co band .",
    "large abundances of co ( @xmath24 ) are required to push the weighting functions at these wavelengths high up in the atmosphere where the inversion is strongest .",
    "this high abundance of co dominates the c to o ratio forcing c / o s of unity , again consistent with the results of madhusudhan & seager ( 2009 ) .",
    "the temperatures at pressure levels higher than the @xmath2050 mbar level exceed those of the tio condensation curve supporting the hypothesis that tio is the cause for inversions .",
    "however , these temperatures exceed the tio condensation curve _ because _ of the inversion .",
    "if the inversion were not present , the temperatures at these levels would be cooler than the tio condensation curve , begging the question of whether or not tio is actually the cause of the inversion or if it is some other absorber .",
    "we suppose though , that if the planet had a higher internal heat flux when it first formed , it may have reached this state by cooling from a hotter profile where tio and vo were in gas phase everywhere    future observations with the hst wfc3 may should provide additional confirmation of the existence of a temperature inversion .",
    "the co feature near 1.6 @xmath15 m probes altitude regions near the 100 mbar level  where the temperature is increasing from the minimum  whereas the bluer wavelengths probe the few bars levels . hence these wavelengths probe regions of the atmosphere that bracket the temperature minimum , as determined by the broadband data .",
    "the existence of this feature will confirm the presence of a temperature inversion as well as the high co abundance .",
    "gj436b is a warm ( @xmath20700 - 900 k ) neptune - mass planet with a seemingly unusual atmosphere chemistry that has generated considerable attention in the modeling community .",
    "the first set of spitzer observations ( stevenson et al . 2010 ) indicated that this planet is rich in co and depleted in ch@xmath1 . this conclusion is primarily driven by the high 3.6 to 4.5 @xmath15 m flux ratio .",
    "this composition is at odds with its temperature given the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium and solar elemental abundances .",
    "one would expect such a planet to be rich in methane and low in co. these authors suggested that photochemistry might be responsible for the apparent depletion of methane .",

    "2011 ; miller - ricci et al . 2012 ; moses et al .",
    "it has recently been suggested that this planet has an extremely metal - rich ( 300 - 2000@xmath25 solar ) atmosphere , which provides a simple explanation for the measured enhancement of co over ch@xmath1 without the need to invoke extreme or exotic chemistry ( moses et al .",

    "crossfield et al .",
    "( 2012b ) suggests ( via private comm . from n. cowan ) that the flux resulting from this analysis is likely more reliable than the flux resulting from the  ellipsoidal \" analysis due to the more realistic assumptions about the planetary shape .",

    "we find a nearly isothermal atmosphere with the potential for a weak inversion ( @xmath202.5@xmath23 as defined in  [ sec : hd209 ] ) , though the small temperature gradients near the temperature minimum are enough to invoke absorption and emission features ( figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) . the self - consistent temperature profile from crossfield et al .",
    "( 2012b ) is in very good agreement with our retrieved spread .    the preferred solutions from the demc favor an atmosphere that is very abundant in co@xmath0 ( figure [ fig : figure3 ] , blue histogram ) .",
    "this high abundance of co@xmath0 drives the c to o ratio closer to solar than to unity . if we repeat the results using the 4.5@xmath15 m  ellipsoidal \" derived data point , the lower flux value drives the co@xmath0 abundance to even higher levels .",
    "the inversion depth strengthens slightly . in both cases we note that the water abundance can span a wide range",
    "this is different than in madhusudhan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) where in general the retrieved water abundances were lower than  10 parts - per - million , which was the primary driver in determining a high c / o .",
    "our gas abundance retrievals do not provide strong evidence for a high c / o atmosphere , though we can not rule out such a possibility ( blue and red curves in figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) .",
    "one might question how realistic solutions with such high abundances of co@xmath0 may be .",
    "such high co@xmath0 abundances are generally not thermochemically permissible in highly reducing hot - jupiter - like atmospheres . in order to explore this",
    "we have placed an upper limit on the co@xmath0 abundance at a mixing ratio of 10@xmath32 and repeated the retrievals under the  null \" and  ellipsoidal \" assumptions .",

    "should be depleted as suggested by madhusudhan ( 2012 ) .",
    "however , we do not find strong evidence for a high c / o atmosphere .",
    "it is difficult to disentangle the reason for the discrepancy between our results and those of madhusudhan et al .",

    "a detailed model comparison over a wide range of parameter space would be needed to identify potential differences .",
    "future observations and modeling of this intriguing planet are certainly needed in order to draw firm conclusions .",

    "anderson et al . (",

    "wasp-19 is one of the most active stars to host a hot jupiter , therefore uv destruction of an absorbing molecule could also provide an alternative explanation ( e.g. knutson et al . 2010 ) .",
    "madhusudhan ( 2012 ) explored both carbon - rich and oxygen - rich models for this planet and concluded that the observations are unable to constrain the c to o ratio , but may slightly favor a c to o ratio greater than one .",

    "although we quote a 68@xmath17 confidence interval for each species , we note that these confidence intervals are nearly the same as those given by the prior , suggesting relatively weak constraints from the data aside from a slight preference for higher abundances of methane . as a result of these weak constraints",

    "<S> secondary eclipse spectroscopy provides invaluable insights into the temperatures and compositions of exoplanetary atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a systematic temperature and abundance retrieval analysis of nine exoplanets ( hd189733b , hd209458b , hd149026b , gj436b , wasp-12b , wasp-19b , wasp-43b , tres-2b , and tres-3b ) observed in secondary eclipse using a combination of space- and ground - based facilities . </S>",
    "<S> our goal with this analysis is to provide a consistent set of temperatures and compositions from which self - consistent models can be compared and to probe the underlying processes that shape these atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is the second in a three part series of papers exploring the retrievability of temperatures and abundances from secondary eclipse spectra and the implications of these results for the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres . in this investigation </S>",
    "<S> we present a catalogue of temperatures and abundances for h@xmath0o , ch@xmath1 , co , and co@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our temperatures and abundances are generally consistent with those of previous studies , although we do not find any statistically convincing evidence for super - solar c to o ratios ( e.g. , solar c / o falls in the 1-sigma confidence intervals in eight of the nine planets in our sample ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , within our sample we find little evidence for thermal inversions over a wide range of effective temperatures ( with the exception of hd209458b ) , consistent with previous investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of evidence for inversions for most planets in our sample over such a wide range of effective temperatures provides additional support for the hypothesis that tio is unlikely to be the absorber responsible for the formation of these inversions . </S>"
