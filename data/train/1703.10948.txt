    "many proteins can begin folding to their native states before their synthesis is complete  @xcite . as much as one - third of a bacterial proteome",
    "is believed to fold co - translationally  @xcite , with an even higher percentage likely in more slowly translated eukaryotic proteomes .",
    "numerous experiments on both natural and engineered amino - acid sequences have shown that folding during synthesis can have profound effects : compared to denatured and refolded chains , co - translationally folded proteins may be less prone to misfolding  @xcite , aggregation  @xcite and degradation  @xcite , or they may preferentially adopt alternate stable structures  @xcite . because the timescales for protein synthesis and folding are often similar  @xcite , it is clear that the rate of translation can be used to tune the self - assembly of peptide chains _ in vivo _  @xcite . to this point",
    ", however , there exists little evidence that evolution has selected specifically for optimal co - translational folding kinetics across any substantial fraction of an organism s proteome .    in this work , we provide evidence that evolutionary selection has tuned protein - translation rates to optimize co - translational folding pathways .",
    "our approach is motivated by the hypothesis that pauses during protein synthesis may be beneficial for promoting the formation of native structure . by increasing the separation between the timescales for folding and translation",
    ", such pauses may promote the assembly of on - pathway intermediates , which , in turn , template the growth of further native structure .",
    "many experimental and computational studies have shown that protein - folding naturally proceeds in a step - wise manner via structurally distinct intermediates  @xcite , and that cooperative folding can not commence until a minimal number of residues have emerged from the ribosome exit tunnel  @xcite .",
    "these general findings suggest that any beneficial pauses during synthesis should occur at specific locations within an amino - acid sequence .",
    "our analysis of the e.  coli proteome reveals that the majority of beneficial translational pauses are associated with stable native - like co - translational folding intermediates , which we predict using a coarse - grained model of the co - translational folding pathway .",
    "we find that the relevant folding intermediates may not be complete structural domains , as has often been assumed  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the stable native - like structures that are predicted to form during co - translational folding are also likely to differ from the intermediates that are observed when refolding from a denatured ensemble .    to identify pauses in translation , we build our genomic analysis on the observation that synonymous codon usage is extremely non - uniform in highly expressed genes , likely as a result of adaptation for efficient protein production  @xcite .",
    "it has further been established that the subset of codons that appear unusually infrequently in the most highly expressed genes tend to be translated more slowly  @xcite . yet to distinguish beneficial pauses from random fluctuations , it is essential that we identify deviations in translation rates that are evolutionarily conserved across species .",
    "we therefore describe a statistical method for locating regions within mrna transcripts where a local enrichment in rare codons is conserved across multiple divergent species .    by comparing putative translational pause sites with a neutral model that accounts for gene - specific codon usage",
    ", we can assess the likelihood that the same degree of enrichment and conservation could occur by chance alone .",
    "we are thus able to show that , as our confidence in this evolutionary signal increases , the predictive power of our co - translational - folding hypothesis consistently improves as well .",
    "examination of more than 500 proteins suggests that evolutionary selection for optimal co - translational folding is a widespread feature of the e.  coli genome .",
    "our results therefore highlight the extent to which evolution has tuned the self - assembly pathways , and not just the native structures , of complex biomolecules .",
    "our analysis of beneficial pauses in protein synthesis relies on the identification of regions within mrna transcripts that are enriched in ` rare ' codons , i.e.  codons that are used substantially less often than alternate synonymous codons in highly expressed genes  @xcite . despite numerous attempts to predict codon - specific translation rates based on physical factors  @xcite , such as trna concentrations ,",
    "translation - speed estimates based on relative - usage metrics  @xcite remain among the most accurate  @xcite .",
    "thus , by using the concentration of rare codons as a proxy for translation speed , we can look for pauses in synthesis by identifying regions in a mrna transcript that are locally enriched in these codons .",
    "however , an appropriate neutral model must account for two potential sources of synonymous codon - usage bias at the level of an individual gene .",
    "first , we control for the overall rare - codon usage , which is defined as the fraction of rare codons in the entire transcript .",
    "multiple factors have been hypothesized to contribute to the overall degree of codon adaptation in a gene , including evolutionary selection for rapid synthesis , accurate translation and the stability of mrna transcripts . while the overall rare - codon usage of homologous genes is remarkably similar across genomes ( figure  [ fig : homologous_adaptation ] ) , it is nevertheless difficult to say whether this feature is due to selection for an optimal translation rate . by taking a gene",
    "s average codon usage into account , we can pick out regions that are locally enriched in rare codons relative to the gene - specific background .",
    "second , we account for synonymous - codon bias due to the amino - acid composition of the protein sequence .",
    "we assume that amino - acid sequences are generally under stronger selection pressure and can thus be considered immutable .",
    "yet not all amino acids are coded for by rare codons , and , among the amino acids that are , the probabilities of observing rare codons are typically not equal ( table  [ tab : rare_codons ] ) . to account for effects due to the amino - acid sequence",
    ", we estimate the rare - codon frequencies for each amino acid type from the average synonymous - codon usage in all genes with a similar average rare - codon usage .",
    "we then model neutral rare - codon usage for each individual gene as a bernoulli process with sequence - dependent probabilities of rare - codon usage ( see methods ) .",
    "next , we assess the functional importance of local rare - codon enrichment by looking for conservation across multiple - sequence alignments ( figure  [ fig : msa ] ) .",
    "we extended the neutral model described above to 18 sufficiently diverged prokaryotic genomes , with rare - codon definitions and gene - specific rare - codon probabilities computed for each genome independently . here",
    "our approach differs from conventional conservation analyses , because we are interested in the enrichment of rare codons within contiguous 15-codon segments of a transcript , as opposed to the codon usage at each aligned site  @xcite . as a result , we can identify locally enriched regions that do not align precisely but nevertheless result in translational pauses at similar places within the protein sequence .",
    "this approach also allows for a meaningful comparison of the local rare - codon enrichment in sequence alignments that contain insertions and deletions .",
    "our choice of a 15-codon enrichment region is comparable to the length of a typical element of protein secondary structure , and we verified that regions with widths of 10 and 20 codons yield similar results .",
    "in contrast , larger enrichment regions defined on the basis of complete domains rarely differ significantly from the background rare - codon usage , while analyses of single aligned sites tend not to produce statistically significant results .    to be relevant for co - translational folding , putative slowly translated regions must meet two criteria : a high degree of conservation of slowly translated codons , and a low probability of such an occurrence in the neutral model . for a region to be considered both enriched and conserved , we require that the local concentration of rare codons deviate from the background distribution by approximately one standard deviation in at least 75% of the sequences in the alignment ; figure  [ fig : alternative_conservation ] shows that our results are robust with respect to this conservation threshold .",
    "we then compute an associated p - value that reports the probability , within the neutral model , of randomly generating at least the observed number of enriched regions from reverse translations of the aligned amino - acid sequences .",
    "this second criterion is central to our findings , as we shall discuss below .",
    "we emphasize that these criteria are distinct : depending on the amino - acid identities , it is possible to observe low p - values without significant rare - codon enrichment relative to the background , and vice versa .",
    "consequently , both criteria must be satisfied in order to establish the evolutionary conservation of translational pauses .",
    "our analysis reveals numerous rare - codon enrichment loci in the e.  coli genome that are inconsistent with the neutral model , and are thus likely to be a result of evolutionary selection ( figure  [ fig : rc_distribution]a ) .",
    "although these regions occur throughout the mrna transcripts , their locations are biased towards both the 5 and 3 ends ( figure  [ fig : rc_distribution]b ) . while these trends have been noted previously  @xcite , our analysis confirms that the increased probability of rare - codon enrichment at the 3 end is evolutionarily conserved and is not a consequence of the amino - acid sequences .",
    "furthermore , we find that these biases become more pronounced as we lower the p - value threshold used for comparison with the neutral model ( figure  [ fig : rc_distribution]b ) , suggesting that any false positives from our analysis are relatively evenly distributed throughout the transcripts .",
    "to probe the potential consequences of local rare - codon enrichment for protein folding , we next examine the formation of native - like intermediates during protein synthesis .",
    "a large body of simulation evidence  @xcite has shown that intermediates must be stable at equilibrium in order to be sampled with high probability during co - translational folding .",
    "in addition , such intermediates are only likely to form when the folding rate is fast relative to the protein elongation rate .",
    "therefore , while an intermediate s equilibrium free energy does not completely determine whether it will appear on a co - translational folding pathway , we predict that stability at equilibrium is necessary for a pause in translation to promote the development of native structure .    here",
    "we apply a coarse - grained model  @xcite to predict the formation of stable partial structures during nascent - chain elongation .",
    "although this approach does not provide information about potential misfolded structures , which would be necessary for a full kinetic analysis of co - translational folding , it is sufficient to test the hypothesis that translational pausing promotes the assembly of native structure .",
    "importantly , we do not need to assume that domains fold cooperatively or independently , and we can examine potential co - translational folding intermediates at the sub - domain level .",
    "we are also not limited to analyzing elements of secondary structure , which fold rapidly and are typically unstable in isolation .",
    "in contrast , our coarse - grained model makes predictions regarding the tertiary structure of nascent chains .    to model co -",
    "translational folding , we permit a nascent chain of length @xmath0 to form native contacts among the first @xmath0 residues of the full protein . we then compute the minimum free energy of a nascent chain , relative to an unfolded ensemble , using a mean - field theory based on the protein s native structure ( see methods ) .",
    "this theory captures the opposing contributions to the free energy from energetically favorable native contacts and the configurational entropy of an unfolded chain .",
    "furthermore , our approach allows native contacts to form in multiple structured regions that are connected by disordered chains .",
    "we use a native - centric energy function that emphasizes hydrogen bonds and contacts between larger residues  @xcite , while the thermodynamic stability of the native state is fixed based on the full protein length  @xcite ( see methods ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : temperature ] that tuning the native - state stability does not significantly affect the results of our analysis .",
    "our calculations predict that , in general , native structure forms discontinuously during nascent - chain elongation . in the example shown in figure",
    "[ fig : cotranslational_folding ] , the decreases in the nascent - chain free energy at discrete chain lengths correspond to the stabilization of native - like intermediates ; the native contacts contributing to the intermediates are shown in the contact maps below .",
    "we also plot the free energy of the nascent - chain configurations in which the terminal residue is constrained to make contact with a pre - existing structured region . at chain lengths",
    "where this latter free energy increases , newly synthesized residues can not bind stably to any nascent native structure .",
    "unsurprisingly , for most proteins , the probability of finding a stable on - pathway intermediate increases as synthesis nears completion ( figure  [ fig : intermediate_distribution ] ) .",
    "we are now in a position to test the relationship between translational pausing and the formation of native - like intermediates .",
    "because the ribosome exit tunnel can accommodate between 30 and 60 amino acids , we expect that a beneficial pause in synthesis should be separated from a co - translational intermediate by a roughly equivalent distance ( see methods ) .",
    "an example of this correspondence is shown in figure  [ fig : cotranslational_folding ] , where a putative translational pause is located approximately 30 residues downstream of the formation of a predicted intermediate .",
    "however , we emphasize that , according to the present hypothesis , the formation of an intermediate is necessary but not sufficient to expect that a translational pause would be beneficial .",
    "for example , intermediates that fold quickly relative to the average translation rate or appear less than the exit - tunnel distance from the end of the protein are unlikely to be accompanied by a productive pause .          by applying this analysis to a set of approximately 500 e.  coli proteins with known native structures , we find widespread support for our co - translational folding hypothesis .",
    "in particular , we find that the co - translational folding intermediates predicted by our coarse - grained model account for a significant proportion of the putative slowly translated regions ( figure  [ fig : explained ] ) .",
    "most importantly , we find that the fraction of rare - codon - enriched regions that can be explained by our model increases consistently as we reduce the p - value threshold for establishing evolutionary conservation . in other words ,",
    "the predictive power of our model improves as false positives related to the random clustering of rare codons are preferentially eliminated .",
    "we further tested the sensitivity of our co - translational folding predictions by repeating the above analysis with randomized control sequences .",
    "figure  [ fig : explained ] shows that the predicted fraction of putative pause sites in the e.  coli genome exceeds a control distribution , in which the total number of pause sites at each p - value threshold is preserved but the locations of the enriched regions are uniformly distributed across the transcripts .",
    "although a significant fraction ( @xmath1% ) of the fictitious pause sites in the randomized sequences can also be explained by our model , likely due to chance overlaps with predicted intermediates , the difference between the genomic and randomized data increases markedly at the lowest p - value thresholds ( one - sided @xmath2 at neutral - model p - value thresholds below 0.01 ; see figure  [ fig : pvalues]a ) .",
    "it is important to note that , because we are considering local fluctuations in rare - codon usage , a neutral - model p - value threshold of 0.05 implies approximately one false positive within each 500-amino - acid protein .",
    "consequently , we find that the predictions of our co - translational folding model are not markedly different from the control distributions unless the p - value threshold is below 0.01 .",
    "two alternative controls ( figure  [ fig : alternative_control ] ) , in which the randomized pause sites are drawn from a non - uniform distribution with a 3-end bias or obtained directly from reverse translations , verify that our results are not solely a consequence of the 3-end rare - codon bias in the mrna transcripts or the amino - acid sequences of the proteins .    next , we performed inverse tests to assess whether co - translational folding intermediates are preferentially associated with putative translational pauses .",
    "however , because the formation of an intermediate is not in itself a sufficient condition for a translational pause to be beneficial , we find that the overall frequency of such associations is small relative to the number of predicted intermediates ( figure  [ fig : confirmed ] ) .",
    "we therefore computed the odds ratio of finding conserved , rare - codon - enriched regions just downstream of a predicted intermediate , as opposed to elsewhere in a mrna transcript .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ fig : odds ] confirm that the association between folding intermediates and translational pause sites is highly significant ( one - sided @xmath2 at neutral - model p - value thresholds below 0.01 ; see figure  [ fig : pvalues]b ) and , importantly , is not related to the overall frequency of predicted co - translational intermediates . here again , the predictive power of our model shows a strong dependence on the p - value threshold used for screening putative pause sites .",
    "in contrast , tests with randomized control sequences do not deviate from an odds ratio of unity .",
    "we also applied our analysis to structural domain boundaries , which have previously been suggested to play a role in coordinating co - translational folding  @xcite .",
    "for these comparisons , we used domain definitions for approximately 800 e.  coli proteins from the scop database  @xcite . surprisingly , we find little evidence of evolutionary selection for translational pausing at domain boundaries .",
    "figure  [ fig : explained ] shows that domain boundaries explain a much smaller fraction of the putative pause sites than our folding model .",
    "furthermore , the predictive power of the domain - boundary hypothesis does not vary with the p - value threshold as expected , and the odds ratios are nearly indistinguishable from the randomized controls ( figure  [ fig : odds ] ) .",
    "these conclusions also hold for various related hypotheses : instead of assuming that a domain must be completely synthesized before folding , we tested models where native structure begins to form either at a fixed number of residues prior to the domain boundary or at a fixed percentage of the domain length ( figure  [ fig : alternative_domains ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the correspondence between the domain boundaries and the conserved , rare - codon enriched loci is significantly weaker than the results of our co - translational folding model . while these findings do not imply that domain boundaries are irrelevant for co - translational folding",
    ", we can conclude that the domain - boundary hypothesis is insufficient to explain the vast majority of conserved , slowly translated regions .    .",
    "by integrating a multiple - sequence analysis of synonymous codon conservation with protein - folding theory , we have shown that highly conserved rare - codon clusters preferentially associate with co - translational folding intermediates .",
    "the putative pause sites in the e.  coli genome that are both evolutionarily conserved and unaccounted for by the neutral model systematically appear downstream of predicted co - translational folding intermediates at distances that are similar to the length of the ribosome exit tunnel .",
    "our large - scale study therefore supports the hypothesis that beneficial pauses during protein synthesis follow key steps in the assembly of native structure .",
    "comparisons with randomized control sequences confirm that our observations are highly significant .",
    "this analysis of co - translational folding pathways , as opposed to elements of the static native structure , provides new insights into the interplay between translation and the self - assembly kinetics of nascent proteins .",
    "the stabilization of a partial structure often occurs well before a native domain is completely synthesized , especially in cases where the domain comprises more than 200 residues .",
    "in particular , sub - domain co - translational folding intermediates typically appear when sufficient tertiary contacts are available to compensate for the loss of chain entropy that is required for folding . of all",
    "predicted intermediates , we find that a relatively small , yet highly significant , fraction are associated with conserved translational pauses . the observation that many co - translational folding intermediates are not followed by conserved pauses is also consistent with our hypothesis , since the effect of a pause depends on the relative timescales for translation and folding , as well as potential interference due to non - native interactions .",
    "this observation further explains why pause sites are not preferentially associated with domain boundaries : although fully synthesized domains may be stable on the ribosome , the prior formation of a partial - chain intermediate is likely to affect the subsequent folding rates for other parts of the protein . as a result , the entire co - translational folding pathway must be considered when interpreting the effect of a pause in translation .",
    "we anticipate that an optimal translation protocol could be predicted with knowledge of the substructure - specific folding and translation rates , as well as their propensities for forming non - native interactions .",
    "the approach that we have taken in this work improves upon earlier studies of rare - codon usage , which have addressed alternative hypotheses regarding translational pausing but yielded mixed results  @xcite .",
    "in addition to our focus on the most physically relevant features of co - translational folding , our conclusions are more robust due to our use of a multiple - sequence analysis to detect evolutionary conservation , as well as our formulation of a neutral model that controls for both amino - acid composition and the inherent codon - usage variability across genes .",
    "the statistical significance of our results is further increased by the much larger sample size used here .",
    "synonymous substitutions can also affect protein synthesis through mechanisms that are unrelated to protein folding , most notably via changes to mrna secondary structure and stability  @xcite .",
    "however , many experimental studies have shown that these effects originate predominantly from substitutions near the 5 end of the mrna transcripts , and typically modulate the total protein production as opposed to the protein quality  @xcite .",
    "mrna - specific effects are thus a likely explanation for the observed 5-end bias in rare - codon enrichment , where variations in translation speed can not play a role in co - translational folding . consequently , we have excluded n - terminal rare codons from our analysis .    in conclusion",
    ", our study highlights the importance of optimal kinetic pathways for efficient biomolecular self - assembly .",
    "although a protein s amino - acid sequence entirely determines its thermodynamically stable structure , it is becoming increasingly clear that synonymous mutations are not always silent .",
    "our analysis provides strong evidence that evolutionary selection has tuned local translation rates to improve the efficiency of co - translational protein folding .",
    "further work is needed to understand the relationship between genome - wide codon usage and translation rates and to improve the prediction of co - translational folding intermediates , including those that contain significant amounts of non - native structure .",
    "nevertheless , our results indicate that folding kinetics play a role in evolutionary selection and suggest that similar relationships may exist for other biological self - assembly phenomena , such as the assembly of macromolecular complexes .",
    "we constructed multiple - sequence alignments based on the amino - acid sequences of homologous genes from 18 prokaryotic species with between 50 and 85% average amino - acid sequence identity to e.  coli ( table  [ tab : genome_list ] ) . for each gene , we calculated the average fraction of rare codons , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the protein length , in all aligned sequences . assuming a poisson process with rate constant  @xmath5 over a region of  @xmath6 consecutive codons , we computed the minimum number of rare codons , @xmath7 , that would have to be observed to achieve an approximately one - standard - deviation enrichment .",
