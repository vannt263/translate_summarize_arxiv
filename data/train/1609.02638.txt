    "when the object is far away from the camera with relatively small depth variation , we may assume a simplified affine camera model as below to approximate the perspective projection .",

    "the mapping from the space to the image becomes linear as the unknown depth scalar @xmath4 in ( [ eq : perspective_projection ] ) is eliminated in ( [ eq : affine_projection1 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the projection of all image points in the @xmath2-th frame can be denoted as @xmath18 = \\mathbf{a}_{i}[\\mathbf{{x}}_1 , \\mathbf{{x}}_2 , \\cdots , \\mathbf{{x}}_n ] + \\mathbf{c}_i\\ ] ] where @xmath19 $ ] is the translation matrix of the frame @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the imaging process of an image sequence can be formulated by stacking equation ( [ eq : ortho_i ] ) frame by frame .",

    "it is easy to verify that @xmath17 in ( [ eq : affine_projection1 ] ) is the image of the centroid of all space points .",
    "thus , if we register all image points in each frame to the respective centroid and adopt relative image coordinates with respect to the centroid , the translation term will vanish , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , the imaging process ( [ eq : affine_rigid_fact1 ] ) is written concisely as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is called the tracking matrix or measurement matrix which is composed by all tracked features .",

    "the tracking matrix is highly rank - deficient , as seen from the right side of ( [ eq : affine_rigid_fact1 ] ) , the rank of @xmath26 is at most 3 if the translation term @xmath29 vanishes . in practice , however , the rank of a real tracking matrix is definitely greater than 3 due to image noise and the affine approximation error . thus , we need to find a rank-3 approximation of the tracking matrix .",
    "a common practice is to perform svd decomposition on the tracking matrix and truncate it to rank 3 , then , the motion matrix @xmath27 and the shape matrix @xmath28 can be easily decomposed from the rank-3 approximation of @xmath26 .",
    "it is obvious that this decomposition is not unique since it is only defined up to a nonsingular linear transformation matrix @xmath30 as @xmath31    since we are interested in the structure and motion parameters in the euclidean space , for this purpose , we need to find a transformation matrix @xmath32 to upgrade the solution to the euclidean frame . the metric constraint on the motion matrix is usually adopted to recover this upgrading matrix @xmath32 @xcite@xcite .",
    "then , the euclidean structure is recovered from @xmath33 and the camera motion parameters of each frame are decomposed from @xmath34 .",
    "previous studies on affine factorization of rigid objects are based on the formulation of ( [ eq : sim_affine ] ) due to its simplicity .",
    "one necessary condition of the rank-3 affine factorization is that all image measurements should be registered to the corresponding centroid of each frame .",
    "however , when some tracked features are missing , or contaminated with outliers and significant noise , it is impossible to reliably retrieve the centroid .",
    "as will be shown in the experiments , the misalignment of the centroid will cause a significant error to the final solution .",
    "previous studies were either simply ignoring this issue or hallucinating the missing features with pseudo observations , which may lead to a biased solution . in this section ,",

    "the rank of the tracking matrix becomes four in this case .",
    "thus , given the tracking matrix , the factorization can be simply obtained via svd decomposition by imposing the rank-4 constraint .",
    "we call the equation ( [ eq : affine_rigid_fact4 ] ) augmented factorization .",
    "it is obvious that the expression ( [ eq : affine_rigid_fact4 ] ) is derived directly from the affine projection model ( [ eq : affine_projection1 ] ) , which does not require image registration with respect to the centroid .",
    "therefore , it is applicable to imperfect data with significant noise , missing entries , and outlying points .",
    "both factorization algorithms ( [ eq : sim_affine ] ) and ( [ eq : affine_rigid_fact4_concise ] ) can be equivalently denoted as the following minimization scheme .",
    "@xmath40 by enforcing different rank constraints , the residual errors corresponding to the algorithms ( [ eq : sim_affine ] ) and ( [ eq : affine_rigid_fact4_concise ] ) would be @xmath41 respectively , where @xmath42 are singular values of the tracking matrix in descending order , and @xmath43 .",
    "it is obvious that the error difference by the two algorithm is @xmath44 . for noise free data ,",
    "if all image points are perfectly registered to the corresponding centroids of every views and the origin of the world system is set at the gravity center of the space points , i.e. , @xmath45 . then , the last column of the motion matrix in ( [ eq : affine_rigid_fact4 ] ) vanishes since @xmath46 , and the expression ( [ eq : affine_rigid_fact4_concise ] ) is equivalent to the rank-3 factorization ( [ eq : sim_affine ] ) . thus ,",
    "( [ eq : sim_affine ] ) is a special case of the augmented factorization after registration to the centroid .",
    "nonetheless , since the image centroid can not be accurately recovered due to the presence of outlying and missing data , the rank-@xmath47 algorithm will yield a big error as @xmath48 does not approach zero in this situation .",

    "the decomposition is not unique since it is defined up to a nonsingular linear transformation @xmath50 as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the recovery of the metric upgrading matrix , as discussed below , is different with that in the rank-3 factorization .",

    "thus , the matrix @xmath67 can be linearly solved via least squares given five or more images .",
    "furthermore , the submatrix @xmath55 can be decomposed from @xmath67 via extended cholesky decomposition as proved in @xcite . after recovering @xmath55 , the last column of the upgrading matrix",
    "is then determined straightforwardly . from the expression ( [ eq : mi ] ) , the projection equation ( [ eq : affine_projection4 ] ) can be written as @xmath70    it can be easily proved from ( [ eq : affine_projection4 m ] ) that the last column @xmath56 corresponds to the translation from the world coordinate system to the image system . under a given coordinate system , different values of @xmath56 will only result in a pure translation of the world system , however , it has no influence to the euclidean structure of the reconstructed object . thus , @xmath56 can be set freely as any 4-vector that is independent of the columns of @xmath55 so as to guarantee the nonsingularity of the resulted upgrading matrix .",

    "svd decomposition is a convenient technique for structure and motion factorization , however , svd only works when the tracking matrix is complete , i.e. , all features are tracked across the sequence . in practice ,",

    "<S> the paper preposes a new scheme to promote the robustness of 3d structure and motion factorization from uncalibrated image sequences . </S>",
    "<S> first , an augmented affine factorization algorithm is proposed to circumvent the difficulty in image registration with imperfect data . </S>",
    "<S> then , an alternative weighted factorization algorithm is designed to handle the missing data and measurement uncertainties in the tracking matrix . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a robust structure and motion factorization scheme is proposed to deal with outlying and missing data . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty and main contribution of the paper are as follows : ( i ) the augmented factorization algorithm is a new addition to previous affine factorization family for both rigid and nonrigid objects ; ( ii ) it is demonstrated that image reprojection residuals are in general proportional to the error magnitude in the tracking data , and thus , the outliers can be detected directly from the distribution of image reprojection residuals , which are then used to estimate the uncertainty of inlying measurement ; ( iii ) the robust factorization scheme is proved empirically to be more efficient and more accurate than other robust algorithms ; and ( iv ) the proposed approach can be directly applied to nonrigid scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> extensive experiments on synthetic data and real images demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach .    computer vision , structure from motion , robust factorization , weighted factorization , reprojection residual , outlier detection . </S>"
