    "despite an impressive number of theoretical papers published during the last 40 - 50 years , the phenomenology and description of neutrino oscillations is still a subject of heated debates . in particular",
    ", there is no consensus on the assumptions of equal energies or equal momenta of the three neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the equal momenta scenario was introduced in a pioneering paper on neutrino oscillations by gribov and pontecorvo @xcite , used by fritzsch and minkowski @xcite and then by many other authors .",
    "the equal energies scenario was presented by kobzarev et al .",
    "@xcite , who considered all three virtual neutrinos produced by a monochromatic beam of electrons colliding with infinitely heavy nuclei ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "since the recoil energy of such nuclei is zero , all three neutrinos have equal energies , the same as the energy of the electron .",
    "stodolsky @xcite , lipkin @xcite and vysotsky @xcite presented general arguments in favor of equal energy scenario for realistic thought experiments .",
    "still , in the most recent and authoritative review of particle physics in the contribution by kaiser @xcite neutrinos oscillations are discussed on the basis of equal momentum scenario .",
    "note that the same attitude one can find in his previous review @xcite , while in 2000 @xcite both equal energy and equal momentum scenarios were considered on the same footing ( all this - in the oversimplified `` neutrino plane wave approximation '' ) .    in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite plane wave free neutrinos traveling from the production point @xmath3 to the detection point @xmath4 were considered without discussing their progenitors .",
    "we will refer to such descriptions as reduced ones . following the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite it is evident that in the `` reduced approach '' only the equal energy scenario is self - consistent .",
    "otherwise the neutrinos are produced at the point @xmath3 not in a given flavor state , but in a state whose flavor oscillates with time .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the progenitor ( electron ) was described by a plane wave .",
    "there exists a vast literature in which both the progenitor and offspring particles are described not by plane waves but by wave packets ( see review by beuthe @xcite ) . in the present paper our attention is concentrated on the incoming and outgoing particles",
    ". we will find that depending on the properties of these external particles both differences of energies and momenta of different neutrino mass eigenstates are non - vanishing , but the energy difference is much smaller than the momentum difference when the energy transfer to the target nucleus is small .    in this note",
    "we are going to consider a more realistic situation than in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , when the beam of electrons is not monochromatic ( it is described by a finite - size wave packet ) , and the mass of the target nucleus is finite . now the recoil energy of the nucleus can not be neglected .",
    "the detection of neutrino occurs when it interacts with another nucleus ( in detector ) .",
    "when a nucleus is in a crystal it is described by a wave function with a characteristic momentum spread about 1 kev and vanishing mean momentum . when the nucleus is in gas",
    ", its momentum is not vanishing , while momentum spread is smaller .",
    "( note that even for an infinitely heavy nucleus in crystal the spread of the momentum is non - zero ) .",
    "we will prove that in the case of finite masses of nuclei @xmath3 or @xmath4 neutrino oscillations disappear in the limit of the vanishing momentum spread of the electron wave packet ( plane wave limit ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .",
    "we introduce `` little donkey '' diagram with a virtual neutrino propagating between production and detection points in section 2 . the amplitude is derived and analyzed in section 3 .",
    "the expression of the phase difference responsible for oscillations is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the probability of neutrino oscillations and their suppression is discussed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider interaction of an electron @xmath5 with a nucleus @xmath3 of mass @xmath6 in a target .",
    "neutrino produced in this interaction collides later on in a detector with a nucleus @xmath4 of mass @xmath7 and produces a charged lepton @xmath8 . as a result",
    "the whole process looks like @xmath9 , ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    the electronic neutrino @xmath10 produced on nucleus @xmath3 is a superposition of three neutrino mass eigenstates : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the state with mass @xmath13 .",
    "each mass eigenstate propagates independently between nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "interaction with @xmath4 results in projection of the three neutrino propagating states on the state @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the unitary mixing matrix , the first and second indices of which denote respectively flavor and mass eigenstates .    in oscillation experiments the nuclei @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not registered , while the energy and momentum of the lepton @xmath8 are measured with low precision .",
    "thus the probability of the whole process is obtained by integration of the amplitude squared , possibly weighted with the detector resolution function , over @xmath18    @xmath19    here @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the amplitude for a given neutrino state with mass @xmath13 ; symbols like @xmath22 denote @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "let us express @xmath25 in terms of the wave functions of all interacting particles : @xmath26 and neutrino propagator @xmath27 : @xmath28    in ref .",
    "@xcite electron @xmath5 and lepton @xmath8 were described by plane waves :    @xmath29    while nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 were described by @xmath30-functions in configuration space .",
    "now we assume that nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 are described by the finite - size wave packets : @xmath31 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the central momenta of the wave packets of nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corresponding running momenta . in eqs .",
    "( [ innucl s ] ) and below we use gaussian wave packets .",
    "the main features of our results do not depend upon the specific form of the packets . in our subsequent publication",
    "we are going to take for them a general form .",
    "the wave functions of nuclei satisfy klein - gordon equation as we consistently neglect the spins of all particles .",
    "all external particles are assumed to be free and hence their momenta satisfy the on - mass - shell condition :    @xmath34    where the index @xmath35 denotes @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the same is true also for outgoing particles .    since in neutrino oscillation experiments the final nuclei @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "are not registered , one can choose for their wave functions any basis in the hilbert space , and then integrate the probability over all hilbert space . in what follows",
    "we take plane waves as the complete and orthogonal set of wave functions :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we think that description of outgoing particles by wave packets in the amplitude is not a consistent procedure , because generally wave packets do not have orthogonality property , neither they form a complete set of functions .    here",
    "we would like to touch upon a subtle point . in a more or less realistic thought experiment the target and the detector",
    "are solids , therefore the on - mass - shell condition for nuclei is only an approximation .",
    "this approximation seems to be reasonable for ordinary matter , where nuclei are weakly bound .    instead of the plane wave of ref .",
    "@xcite , the wave function of the electron is described now by the one dimensional wave packet with definite direction @xmath39 of the beam : @xmath40 here and in the following : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the corresponding solid angle , and @xmath43",
    ". we will show below that the oscillation terms vanish when @xmath44 tends to zero .",
    "we choose the one - dimensional packet only because of technical simplicity .",
    "the result can be obtained in a more general case .",
    "following ref . @xcite",
    "we replace the neutrino green function with the propagator of a scalar particle of mass @xmath45 , where @xmath46 numerates neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath1 ; it is clear that fermionic nature of the neutrino ( as well as of @xmath5 and @xmath8 ) is not essential in the problem .",
    "thus    @xmath47    for each @xmath0 the amplitude of the process is written as    @xmath48    where we use @xmath49 , and    @xmath50    the parameter @xmath51 is defined by    @xmath52    and    @xmath53    though @xmath54 looks like a three - momentum , in fact , it is a short - hand notation , usually arising in description of propagation of spherical waves with definite energy .",
    "the integration over @xmath55 in eq.([ampl ] ) gives @xmath30-function leading to energy conservation .",
    "the further analysis of the problem is greatly simplified if the distance @xmath56 is much larger than the sizes of wave packets of nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 . to take this into account ,",
    "let us shift the variables of integration :    @xmath57    the wave packets of the nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 are essentially different from zero if @xmath58 , @xmath59 , hence    @xmath60 is the unit vector in the direction @xmath61 .    by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ coord ] ) and ( [ n - vect ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) we obtain after integration over @xmath62 and @xmath63 :    @xmath64    the @xmath46-dependent momenta @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined as : @xmath67    we integrate over @xmath68 using ( [ dq_e ] ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "( [ omega - p - dep . ] ) ) , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the jacobian , left after integration of the energy @xmath30-function in ( [ ampl \" ] ) .",
    "( in eq.([ampl \" ] ) there are three @xmath30-functions , one of them expressing the energy conservation , while the other two refer to momentum conservation in @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertices . )",
    "we have already stressed that @xmath54 is not a momentum , but a parameter characterizing spherical neutrino wave .",
    "now we see that in the case of very large distance @xmath56 the parameter @xmath73 does play the role of the neutrino momentum .",
    "we are faced with the situation when neutrino being virtual particle at short distance from the source becomes effectively real at large distance , near detector .",
    "we are interested first of all in the phases of amplitudes of the process considered . from eq .",
    "( [ ampl_3 ] ) one can see that the phase of @xmath25 equals to    @xmath74    and dependence of @xmath54 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 on @xmath45 is given by the system of equations ( [ omega - p - dep . ] ) , ( [ kappa ] ) , ( [ q - q-dep ] ) , and by the on - mass - shell conditions for nuclei and electron .    from eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) it follows that @xmath77    in equation ( [ phases ] ) the difference of the electron energies could be expressed through the difference of the corresponding momenta : @xmath78    since neutrino masses are much smaller than energies and momenta of external particles the neutrino energy tends to : @xmath79 , the value defined by the energy conservation in the process @xmath80 , and since @xmath81 , the phase difference approaches its standard value @xmath82 ] we may write :    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    where @xmath86 , and the subscript @xmath35 denotes @xmath87 .",
    "the quantities @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are defined by the external parameters from eqs .",

    "by using eq . ( [ ampl ] ) we obtain the following expression for @xmath111 describing neutrino oscillations in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ p_exp ] ) : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is given by eq .",

    "let us make the following remark .",

    "\\1 ) we see that the alternative `` equal energies versus equal momenta '' is naturally resolved if one consistently uses the standard rules of quantum mechanics and in particular quantum field theory . in the example , which we consider here , using the propagator of virtual neutrinos and mixed description of initial ( wave packets ) and final ( plane waves ) particles all kinematical variables are uniquely defined . in particular , when we go beyond plane wave approximation for initial particles there is no equal momenta nor equal energies . however , still @xmath130 at least for non - relativistic nuclei .",
