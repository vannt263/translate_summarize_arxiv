    "<S> we report on the spin dynamics of @xmath0c isotope enriched inner - walls in double - wall carbon nanotubes ( dwcnt ) using @xmath0c nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to expectations , we find that our data set implies that the spin - lattice relaxation time ( @xmath1 ) has the same temperature ( @xmath2 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) dependence for most of the innerwall nanotubes detected by nmr . in the high temperature regime ( @xmath4 k ) , we find that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence of @xmath5 is consistent with a 1d metallic chain . for @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> k we find a significant increase in @xmath5 with decreasing @xmath2 , followed by a sharp drop below @xmath7 20 k. the data clearly indicates the formation of a gap in the spin excitation spectrum , where the gap value @xmath8 40 k ( @xmath9 3.7 mev ) is @xmath3 independent .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes have been of a topic of intense investigation ever since their discovery in early 1990 s . according to band - structure calculations the basic electronic structure of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnt ) </S>",
    "<S> is expected to depend on the chiral wrapping vector @xmath10 across the graphene plane , where tubes for which @xmath11 _ integer _ are metallic , while all other tubes are semiconducting @xcite with a large @xmath121 ev gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while stm and transport measurements on _ isolated _ tubes demonstrate the diversity of tube properties , significant measurements on _ macroscopic _ amounts of tubes are only possible in selected cases . </S>",
    "<S> photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) measurements on metallic tubes in bundles @xcite suggest that strong electron - electron correlations can lead to a tomonaga - luttinger - liquid ( tll ) state . </S>",
    "<S> recently , double wall carbon nanotubes ( dwcnt ) have been synthesized by filling swcnt with fullerenes ( so called  </S>",
    "<S> peapods@xcite ) followed by a high temperature reaction which merges the fullerenes into inner tubes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these dwcnt have some exceptional properties since the inner tubes are accommodated in a highly shielded environment under clean room conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> raman experiments performed even on bucky paper material allows one to detect some significant properties of these inner tubes due to their small diameter ( high curvature ) .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is usually an excellent technique for probing the electronic properties at the fermi level of metallic systems , take for instance conducting polymers , fullerenes , and high temperature superconductors to mention a few . </S>",
    "<S> however the 1.1% natural abundance of @xmath0c with nuclear spin @xmath13=1/2 limits the sensitivity of such experiments . </S>",
    "<S> data taken on swcnt essentially evidence a large distribution of properties since samples of identical tubes are presently out of reach . in this report </S>",
    "<S> , selective enrichment of the inner shells using @xmath0c isotope enriched fullerenes @xcite in the `` peapod '' synthesis route is used to probe the specific properties of the inner tubes . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0c enrichment allows us to increase the @xmath0c nmr sensitivity by two orders of magnitude , and furthermore achieve _ selective _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0c enrichment of the inner shells alone . </S>",
    "<S> this provides us with the possibility of singling out the electronic properties of these inner tubes for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , although these tubes are distributed in diameter and chirality , their electronic properties display a strikingly homogeneous behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic properties of these inner wall nanotubes behave as for a 1d metal at room @xmath2 , but exhibits a pronounced gap below @xmath1420 k. this unexpected result reveals that this specific macroscopic collection of carbon nanotubes is an object displaying original physical properties worth studying in more detail with macroscopic experimental techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> all @xmath0c nmr data in this report were taken with the sample sealed in a 6 mm diameter glass tube filled with 200 mbar of high purity helium gas . </S>",
    "<S> details of the synthesis techniques and various independent experimental evidences for the formation of 89% @xmath0c isotope enriched inner - walls inside natural 1.1% @xmath0c enriched outer walls are reported elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we probed the low frequency spin dynamics ( or low energy spin excitations , equivalently ) of the inner - tubes using the spin lattice relaxation time , @xmath1 , defined as the characteristic time it takes the @xmath0c nuclear magnetization to recover after saturation . </S>",
    "<S> the signal intensity after saturation , @xmath15 , was deduced by integrating the fast fourier transform of half the spin - echo for different delay times @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> all data were taken with excitation pulse lengths @xmath17s and short pulse separation times of @xmath18s @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the value of @xmath1 by fitting the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath15 to the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are arbitrary signal amplitudes , and @xmath23 \\label{stretch}\\ ] ] is the reduced magnetization recovery of the @xmath0c nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ recov ] shows the results of @xmath24 for the inner - tubes as a function of the scaled delay time @xmath25 , under various experimental conditions listed in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath24 does not follow the single exponential form with @xmath26 ( dashed line ) , but instead fits well to the stretched exponential form with @xmath27 which implies a distribution in underlying relaxation times @xmath1 across the sample . in such cases , @xmath28 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ stretch ] ) is directly proportional to the mean value @xmath29 of the @xmath1 distribution as such @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gamma function . </S>",
    "<S> we display the data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ recov ] on a semi - log scale for the @xmath32 axis in order to accentuate the data for earlier decay times and to illustrate the collapse of the data set for the upper 90% of the nmr signal . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the upper 90% of the @xmath24 data is consistent with constant @xmath27 ( see inset ) , implying a constant underlying distribution in @xmath1 for a large range of experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the lower 10% of the @xmath24 data ( corresponding to longer delay times ) comes from the non - enriched outer - walls which , as a result of their larger diameters , have much longer relaxation times under similar experimental conditions @xcite .    two distinct origins for the multi - exponential magnetization recovery can be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the first is due to the powder average over the spatial anisotropy in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is independent of the tube properties , and can also be found in the @xmath0c nmr data for alkali doped fullerenes a@xmath33c@xmath34 @xcite . given the similar diameter of c@xmath34 ( @xmath35 0.71 nm ) to the average inner - wall diameter ( @xmath36 0.7 nm @xcite ) in this report , we can expect comparable bonding effects for the electron orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that in a@xmath33c@xmath34 the @xmath37 for @xmath0c is dominated by dipole - dipole interactions between the electron spin in the @xmath38 bond and the @xmath0c nuclear spin @xcite . in this case , the relaxation depends on the orientation of the @xmath39 orbital ( which is perpendicular to the tube surface ) and the external magnetic field , and therefore contributes to the multi - exponential form of magnetization recovery for a powder average . </S>",
    "<S> this resultant @xmath1 distribution is independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> another source of multi - exponential recovery is from a distribution of the inner tube properties themselves , such as their diameter . </S>",
    "<S> according to raman scattering , the inner tubes have a mean diameter of @xmath40 nm with a standard deviation of @xmath41 0.1 nm @xcite . within this distribution </S>",
    "<S> lies a variety of tubes with different chirality and one can _ a priori _ expect to find metallic as well as semiconducting tubes @xcite . if both semiconducting and metallic inner - tubes existed in our sample , one would expect the ratio of the @xmath1 s between the different tubes to increase exponentially with decreasing @xmath2 below the semiconducting gap ( @xmath42 k @xcite ) , which would drastically change the underlying @xmath1 distribution with decreasing @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this change would manifest itself as a large change in the shape of the recovery @xmath24 , however , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ recov ] this is @xmath43 the case . we can therefore rule out the possibility of two components in @xmath1 with different @xmath2 dependences , and instead we conclude _ that all @xmath1 components exhibit the same @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence within experimental scattering . </S>",
    "<S> _    the @xmath1 distribution in the sample , whether it arises from anisotropy or diameter variations ( or both ) , shows a uniform @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore appropriate to follow the @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence of the mean value of the distribution ( @xmath28 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ stretch ] ) ) , and thereby get insight into the homogenous electronic state of the inner tubes . in order to avoid unnecessary experimental scattering in @xmath28 , we then go back and fit all the @xmath24 data to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ stretch ] ) with a @xmath44 value of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the resulting temperature dependence of @xmath46 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ t1 t ] for two different values of the magnetic field @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we can immediately separate the data into two temperature regimes ; the high temperature regime @xmath47 150 k , and the low @xmath2 regime @xmath48 150 k. at high temperatures we find that @xmath46 is independent of @xmath2 which indicates a metallic state @xcite , which given the arguments above implies that all of the inner tubes are metallic . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a strong field dependence for @xmath37 which is best illustrated by plotting the high temperature value of @xmath46 against @xmath49 for @xmath3 values ranging from 1.2 tesla to 9.3 tesla , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sqrth ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the data fit well to the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants , which is very suggestive of a 1d spin diffusion mechanism for @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 corresponds to the diffusive contribution to the relaxation originating from the long wavelength ( i.e. @xmath54 ) modes , while @xmath51 corresponds to the non - diffusive contributions from @xmath55 modes . </S>",
    "<S> a cutoff to the divergence in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sqrt ] ) as @xmath56 is often encountered in 1d spin chain systems @xcite due to inter - chain coupling . in the present case </S>",
    "<S> , we can postulate that electron tunneling between inner to outer walls could cause similar cutoff effects , however the data down to the lowest field of @xmath3=1.2 tesla indicates that the cutoff has not been reached yet . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the high - temperature regime is consistent with a 1d metallic chain .    </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the unusual @xmath2 dependence of 1/@xmath57 in the low temperature regime ( @xmath58 k ) is not immediately obvious . </S>",
    "<S> we can however rule out certain possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we can rule out the possibility of an activation type mechanism where @xmath1 is dominated by fluctuating hyperfine fields which are slowing down with decreasing @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> if this were the case the temperature where 1/@xmath57 reached its maximum would shift with the resonance frequency @xmath59 @xcite , or the applied magnetic field @xmath60 ( @xmath61 mhz / tesla is the gyromagnetic ratio for @xmath0c ) , equivalently . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ t1 t ] , however , we find no evidence of a shift in the peak temperature with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at low temperatures 1/@xmath57 is found to drop below its high temperature value which rules out the possibility of an activation contribution @xmath62 a @xmath2 independent contribution . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we also rule out the possibility that the @xmath2 dependence of 1/@xmath57 is a result of paramagnetic centers which can arise from wall defects or impurity spins . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that a pronounced @xmath63 exists in 1/@xmath57 implies a pronounced gap in the low energy spin excitation spectrum , which can not be explained by the presence of paramagnetic centers . </S>",
    "<S> we note that at the lowest temperatures @xmath64 k ( not shown ) , @xmath65 becomes so long @xmath66 s ) that the low energy spin excitations specific to the homogeneous properties of the inner - tubes become inefficient , and other excitations take over , possibly defect related . in such cases </S>",
    "<S> we find that the shape of @xmath24 is no longer universal and that the underlying distribution in @xmath1 is smoothed out , possibly as a result of nuclear spin - diffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> having ruled out the above possibilities , we are then lead to consider the simplest explanation for the experimental data using a non - interacting electron model of a 1d semiconductor with a small secondary gap ( sg ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sg may be a result of the finite inner - wall curvature @xcite , or perhaps the applied magnetic field itself @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can fit the 1/@xmath67 data using this non - interacting model with only one free parameter , the homogeneous sg , 2@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> we start by taking the normalized form of the gapped 1d density - of - states @xmath69 @xmath70 also known as the van - hove singularity ( @xmath71 is taken with respect to the fermi energy ) . we then use eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ newdos ] ) to calculate 1/@xmath57 @xcite as such @xmath72 where @xmath71 and @xmath73 are in temperature units for clarity , @xmath74 is the fermi function @xmath75^{-1}$ ] , and the amplitude factor @xmath76 is taken directly from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sqrt ] ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sqrth ] ( where @xmath77s@xmath78k@xmath79 for @xmath80 in temperature units ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that factoring out the diffusion effects from the integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gapt1 ] ) is an approximation valid only if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are @xmath2 independent . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gapt1 ] ) can not be solved analytically , therefore we resort to numerical integration . the results of the best fit to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gapt1 ] ) are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ t1 t ] , where @xmath81 k ( @xmath9 3.7 mev ) is found to be @xmath3 independent ( within experimental scattering ) between 9.3 and 3.6 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> we note that at the largest external field of 9.3 tesla , @xmath82 mk @xmath83 , however , @xmath59 must be retained inside the integral . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the one dimensionality which yields a logarithmic divergence inside the integral of the form ln@xmath84 for @xmath85 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ what could possibly be the origin of the observed gap _ ? </S>",
    "<S> tight binding calculations predict that applied magnetic fields can induce sg s of similar magnitude for metallic swcnt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a scenario is excluded here from the absence of field dependence of the observed gap . </S>",
    "<S> our data would be more consistent with a curvature induced sg for metallic tubes @xcite , however for our typical inner - tubes the predicted values , @xmath86 mev , are over an order of magnitude larger than our experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> other scenarios , such as quantization of levels due to finite short lengths of the nanotubes could be considered as well , however , in all these cases a behaviour independent of tube size and chirality is certainly not expected .    </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to consider the effect of electron - electron interactions for the metallic inner tubes . </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that electron - electron correlations and a tll state leads to an increase in 1/@xmath87 with decreasing @xmath2 @xcite , which is a direct consequence of the 1d electronic state . </S>",
    "<S> the correlated 1d nature may also lead to a peierls instability @xcite with the opening of a small collective gap @xmath88 and a sharp drop in 1/@xmath87 below @xmath89 k. therefore , the presence of both a tll state _ and _ a peierls instability could possibly account for the data , although here again , the independence on tube geometry should be accounted for .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the @xmath1 recovery data indicate that most of the inner - tubes have similar @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependences , with no indication of a metallic / semiconductor separation due to chirality distributions . at high temperatures ( @xmath90 k ) 1/@xmath57 of the inner tubes </S>",
    "<S> exhibit a metallic 1d spin diffusion state , with no low - field cutoff down to 1.2 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> this metallicity could result from charge transfer from the outer to the inner tubes , however this speculation ought to be confirmed by independent experiments and theoretical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath12150 k , 1/@xmath57 increases dramatically with decreasing @xmath2 , and a gap in the spin excitation spectrum is found below @xmath91 20 k. we list various interpretations for this temperature dependence , ranging from a non - interacting secondary band - gap model to a 1d correlated electron model with a collective gap ( possibly a peierls instability ) . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , these results should stimulate further experimental investigations on diversely synthesized dwcnt in order to check whether these observations are specific to the  peapod  synthesis route . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , theoretical work on the incidence of 1d correlation effects for inner - wall nanotubes inside dwcnt should be helpful in sorting out the origin of our astonishing experimental evidence . </S>"
