    "our main theorem is the following .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath7 be any bounded open set , and let @xmath8 be a bi - lipschitz orientation - preserving homeomorphism .",
    "then , for any @xmath9 and any @xmath10 , there exists a bi - lipschitz orientation - preserving homeomorphism @xmath11 such that @xmath12 on @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is either countably piecewise affine or smooth .",
    "more precisely , there exist two geometric constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that , if @xmath5 is @xmath18 bi - lipschitz , then the countably piecewise affine approximation can be chosen to be @xmath19 bi - lipschitz , while the smooth approximation can be chosen to be @xmath20 bi - lipschitz .",
    "thanks to a result by mora - corral and the second author  @xcite ( see theorem  [ mp ] below ) , the problem of finding smooth approximations can be actually reduced to find countably piecewise affine ones i.e .",
    "affine on the elements of a locally finite triangulation of @xmath2 , see definition  [ def : triang ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath15 might not be ( finitely ) piecewise affine but countably piecewise affine is due to the fact that we require @xmath21 on @xmath22 , so it is clearly impossible to find a ( finitely ) piecewise affine approximation @xmath15 unless the domain is a polygon and @xmath5 is piecewise affine on the boundary .",
    "in fact , we also prove the following result .",
    "[ mainaffine ] if under the assumptions of theorem  [ main ] one has also that @xmath2 is polygonal and @xmath5 is piecewise affine on @xmath13 , then there exists a ( finitely ) piecewise affine approximation @xmath11 as in theorem  [ main ] which is @xmath23 bi - lipschitz .",
    "about the dependence of @xmath24 in theorem  [ mainaffine ] on the domain @xmath2 , see remark  [ depc ] .",
    "the first naive idea coming to one s mind in order to construct a piecewise affine approximation of @xmath5 could be the following : first , to select an arbitrary locally affine triangulation of @xmath2 with triangles of sufficiently small diameter ; then , to define @xmath15 as the function which , on every triangle , is the affine interpolation of the values of @xmath5 on its vertices .",
    "unfortunately , if on one hand the functions defined in this way provide an approximation of @xmath5 in @xmath25 , on the other hand they may fail to be homeomorphisms .",
    "the problem is due to the fact that , taking arbitrary nondegenerate triangles in @xmath2 no matter how small then the affine interpolation of @xmath5 on the vertices of the triangles can be orientation - preserving on some triangles and orientation - reversing on the others ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this prevents the affine interpolation to be injective since an homeomorphism on a connected domain in @xmath4 must be either orientation - preserving on every subdomain , or orientation - reversing on every subdomain .",
    "an explicit example of a function with such a bad behaviour can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the general problem of finding suitable approximations of homeomorphisms @xmath26 with piecewise affine homeomorphisms has a long history . as far as we know , in the simplest non - trivial setting ( i.e. @xmath27 , approximations in the @xmath25-norm ) the problem was solved by rad  @xcite . due to its fundamental importance in geometric topology , the problem of finding piecewise affine homeomorphic approximations in the @xmath25-norm and dimensions @xmath28 was deeply investigated in the 50s and 60s . in particular , it was solved by moise  @xcite and bing  @xcite in the case @xmath29 ( see also the survey book  @xcite ) , while for contractible spaces of dimension @xmath30 the result follows from theorems of connell  @xcite , bing  @xcite , kirby  @xcite and kirby , siebenmann and wall  @xcite ( for a proof see , e.g. , rushing  @xcite or luukkainen  @xcite ) . finally , twenty years later , while studying the class of quasi - conformal varietes , donaldson and sullivan  @xcite proved that the result is false in dimension 4 .",
    "let us now consider the case of sobolev homeomorphisms @xmath31 for some @xmath32 $ ] . as pointed out by ball",
    "( see  @xcite , see also evans  @xcite ) , the problem of proving the existence of piecewise affine approximations of sobolev homeomorphisms arises naturally when one wants to approximate with finite elements the solutions of minimization problems in nonlinear elasticity ( e.g. the minima of neohookean functionals , see also  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in that context , the function @xmath5 represents the physical deformation of a material with no interpenetration of matter ( in particular , @xmath27 as in the present paper , or @xmath29 ) .",
    "the results available in the literature provide , under increasingly weaker hypotheses on the derivatives of @xmath5 , piecewise affine or smooth approximations of @xmath5 and its derivatives .",
    "the first results were obtained by mora - corral  @xcite ( for planar bi - sobolev mappings that are smooth outside a finite set ) and by bellido and mora - corral  @xcite , in which they prove that if @xmath33 for some @xmath34 $ ] , then one can find piecewise affine approximations @xmath15 in @xmath35 , where @xmath36 depends only on @xmath37 .",
    "recently , iwaniec , kovalev and onninen  @xcite almost completely solved the approximation problem of planar sobolev homeomorphisms , proving that whenever @xmath5 belongs to @xmath0 for some @xmath38 , then it can be approximated by smooth diffeomorphisms @xmath15 in the @xmath0-norm ( improving the previous result for homeomorphisms in @xmath39 found in  @xcite ) .    in all the above - mentioned results ,",
    "approximations are intended in the @xmath0 sense , that is , in place of  ( [ approximation ] ) one obtains estimates of the form @xmath40 whitout any information on the inverses @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "unfortunately , this is still not enough for the applications : in fact , the functionals of nonlinear elasticity usually depend on functions of the jacobian of @xmath5 which explode when @xmath43 ( see for instance  ( * ? ? ?",
    "the physical meaning of choosing such functionals is that too high compressions or strecthings require high energy . as a consequence of this ,",
    "two invertible sobolev functions @xmath5 and @xmath15 which are close in the sense of  ( [ oldapp ] ) may have very different energies . instead , if @xmath5 and @xmath15 are close in the sense of  ( [ approximation ] ) , then their energies are also close .",
    "these considerations suggest to work in the space of bi - sobolev homeomorphisms , that is , homeomorphisms @xmath5 such that both @xmath5 and @xmath41 belong to @xmath0 .",
    "this was also already suggested in the paper by iwaniec , kovalev and onninen ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question  4.2 ) ) .",
    "we only mention here that the study of bi - sobolev homeomorphisms is very active , also in connection with maps of finite distorsion ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper is the first one to take care also of the distance of the inverse maps , leading to a partial result towards the solution of the general problem ( hence , we also give a partial positive answer to question  4.2 of  @xcite ) : in fact , we are able to deal with homeomorphisms which are bi - sobolev for @xmath44 .",
    "the techniques adopted in  @xcite and  @xcite are completely different with respect to the ones which will be used throughout this paper .",
    "while the proof in  @xcite is based on a refinement of the supremum norm approximation of moise  @xcite ( which , as pointed out by the authors themselves , can not be extended to deal with the sobolev case ) and the approach of  @xcite makes use of the identification @xmath45 and involves coordinate - wise p - harmonic functions , our proof is constructive and based on an explicit subdivision of the domain of @xmath5 depending on the lebesgue points of @xmath46 .",
    "we conclude giving a bound on the values of the costants @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath47 appearing in theorems  [ main ] , [ mainaffine ] and  [ teo : bilsquare ] ( while the constant @xmath24 depends on the set @xmath2 , see remark  [ depc ] ) , @xmath48",
    "our proof is constructive , thus long , but it relies essentially on three known facts : the lebesgue differentiation theorem for @xmath49-maps in @xmath50 , the jordan curve theorem and a planar bi - lipschitz extension theorem for homeomorphic images of squares proved in  @xcite . as already mentioned in the introduction , all our effort will be to get a piecewise affine approximation of @xmath5 , since then the smooth extension readily follows by the following recent result from  @xcite .",
    "[ mp ] let @xmath51 be a ( countably ) piecewise affine homeomorphism , bi - lipschitz with constant @xmath18 .",

    "the main implication of these estimates towards the construction of a piecewise affine bi - lipschitz map approximating @xmath5 is the following .",
    "let us take a square @xmath59 as above and let us consider the piecewise affine function @xmath15 which coincides with @xmath5 on the vertices of @xmath68 and is affine on each of the two triangles obtained dividing @xmath68 with a diagonal .",
    "if @xmath69 is sufficiently small , then the @xmath25 estimate implies that @xmath70 is uniformly relatively close to the parallelogram of side lengths at least @xmath71 given by @xmath72 .",
    "hence , since @xmath73 on the vertices of the square and is affine on each side of @xmath74 , the same uniform estimate holds also for @xmath15 . in particular",
    ", the map @xmath15 is orientation preserving , injective , and approximates @xmath5 and its inverse as desired .",
    "finally , thanks to the fact that the lebesgue points of @xmath46 have full measure in @xmath2 , we fix two orthonormal vectors @xmath75 , @xmath76 and , @xmath77 , we find a set @xmath78 with @xmath79 which is made by a uniform `` tiling '' of squares with sides parallel to @xmath75 , @xmath80 with the following property . on each square @xmath68 of the tiling , @xmath46 is sufficiently close to an @xmath18 bi - lipschitz matrix @xmath61 ( in particular , @xmath61 will be equal to @xmath62 for some lebesgue point @xmath81 ) .",
    "then , by the previous remarks , one can show that the piecewise affine function @xmath15 obtained interpolating between the values of @xmath5 on the vertices of the squares is injective and satisfies   on @xmath82 .",

    "summarizing , we have shown the validity of  ( [ bilpr ] ) in any possible case , and this means that the function @xmath403 is injective and @xmath102 bi - lipschitz .",

    "the function @xmath404 is @xmath102 bi - lipschitz from @xmath451 to a subset of @xmath452 , then by theorem  [ teo : bilsquare ] it can be continuously extended to a piecewise affine bi - lipschitz function of the whole square @xmath450 , with bi - lipschitz constant @xmath453 .",

    "then , consider the @xmath123-polygon @xmath82 given by proposition  [ prop : lebappr ] . by the construction of section  [ sect:1 ] , it is not restrictive to assume that @xmath460 , and that @xmath82 is a subset of the @xmath123-tiling of @xmath2",
    ". therefore , we can repeat _ verbatim _ the construction of proposition  [ prop : lipext ] using , as tiling , the @xmath123-tiling of @xmath2 .",
    "notice that in this case assumption  ( [ second ] ) is not valid see the remark right after  ( [ second]) but in fact if @xmath2 is an @xmath459-polygon , and @xmath5 is @xmath459-piecewise affine on @xmath22 , there is no need for the tiling to use smaller and smaller squares at the boundary . as a consequence ,",
    "the bi - lipschitz approximation @xmath321 provided by proposition  [ prop : lipext ] is ( finitely ) piecewise affine instead of countably piecewise affine .",
    "observe that the assumption that @xmath5 is @xmath459-piecewise affine on @xmath22 is essential , because otherwise the map @xmath321 would not coincide with @xmath5 on @xmath22 .    to conclude the proof of theorem  [ main ] ,",
    "we then only need to give the proofs of lemma  [ lem : curves ] and of lemma  [ lem : cross ] .",
    "let @xmath169 be a small number , to be fixed later .",
    "define then @xmath461 , @xmath361 and then recursively @xmath462 in this way , we have selected a finite sequence of points @xmath463 in the segment @xmath360 , where @xmath464 .",
    "we can then already define the function @xmath414 by setting , for any @xmath364 and any @xmath365 , @xmath465 hence , @xmath414 is the interpolation of @xmath5 associated with the points @xmath466 , according with definition  [ def : interp ] .",
    "the function @xmath414 is by construction finitely piecewise affine and @xmath18-lipschitz . by the uniform continuity of @xmath5 in @xmath360",
    "it is also clear that the bound @xmath467 holds true as soon as @xmath468 is small enough . to conclude",

    "if @xmath475 , that is , @xmath58 and @xmath420 belong to two consecutive segments , then by the definition of the points @xmath476 the angle @xmath477 is at least @xmath478 .",
    "hence , @xmath479 so that  ( [ caro21 ] ) is checked .    instead ,",
    "let us see what happens if @xmath480 . in this case",

    ", we have @xmath485 which yields @xmath486 hence  ( [ caro21 ] ) holds true also in this case and we conclude the proof .",
    "let us take a vertex @xmath344 of the grid @xmath342 .",

    "we introduce then the adjusted function @xmath380 of definition  [ eq : valpha ] : to obtain the thesis , we need to check that it fulfills the requirements of lemma  [ lem : cross ] .",
    "thanks to  ( [ trfa ] ) , we already know that @xmath494 . hence , all we have to do is to check that @xmath495 for all @xmath418",
    ". we will do it in some steps .",
    "we start observing an important property , that is , for any @xmath37 and for any @xmath496 we have that @xmath497 if and only if @xmath498 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath498 then @xmath499 for some @xmath348 , and since @xmath380 is affine in the segment @xmath500 , while @xmath501 , then of course @xmath497 .",
    "on the other hand , assume that @xmath502 : we have to show that @xmath503 . if @xmath504 for some @xmath348 , then there are three possibilities . first , if @xmath505 , then @xmath374 is affine on the side @xmath351 , so the claim is trivial .",
    "second , if @xmath506 and @xmath58 belongs to the cross @xmath507 associated to the vertex @xmath377 , then again the claim is immediate since @xmath508 belongs to the ball @xmath509 , which does not intersect @xmath434 by remark  [ rightafter ] .",
    "lastly , if @xmath510 and @xmath511 , then @xmath512 , thus the claim is again obvious by the definition of @xmath371 .    to conclude the step , we have to consider a point @xmath502 which does not belong to any side of @xmath100 starting at @xmath344 .",
    "we have again to distinguish some possible cases .",
    "if @xmath58 belongs to the cross @xmath507 for some @xmath388 , then again the claim follows by the fact that @xmath513 .",
    "if @xmath58 does not belong to any cross and @xmath514 , then @xmath512 so the claim follows because , using the bi - lipschitz property of @xmath5 and the fact that @xmath487 , we have @xmath515 which is impossible because @xmath516 .",
    "finally , consider the case when @xmath517 . in this case",
    ", we surely have @xmath518 by construction , thus by  ( [ luiro ] ) and  ( [ inpa ] ) we get @xmath519 thus the first step is concluded .",
    "now , taken two points @xmath520 , we have to show the validity of  ( [ awhtd ] ) .",
    "let us first suppose that both @xmath58 and @xmath420 belong to the same cross @xmath386 . by construction , @xmath380 is @xmath18 bi - lipschitz on each segment @xmath500 , hence to show  ( [ awhtd ] ) we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath521 and @xmath522 .",
    "therefore , on one side we have @xmath523 on the other side , to estimate @xmath524 from below , assume without loss of generality that @xmath525 , and define @xmath526 so that @xmath527 since the triangle @xmath528 is isosceles , then @xmath529 moreover , we claim that @xmath530 indeed , if both @xmath531 and @xmath532 belong to @xmath342 , then by definition @xmath533 so  ( [ psp ] ) holds true .",
    "conversely , if both @xmath531 and @xmath532 belong to @xmath447 , then since @xmath320 is @xmath83 bi - lipschitz we have @xmath534",
    "so again  ( [ psp ] ) holds true .",
    "finally , assume that @xmath535 while @xmath536 ( the case of @xmath537 and @xmath538 being completely equivalent ) .",
    "in this case , it must clearly be @xmath354 , hence by remark  [ rightafter ] we know that @xmath539 and @xmath540 are both at least @xmath541 , thus @xmath542 . therefore , recalling again  ( [ luiro ] ) , we have @xmath543 thus  ( [ psp ] ) has been finally checked in all the possible cases .",
    "this inequality , together with  ( [ ban ] ) and again with the fact that @xmath380 is @xmath18 bi - lipschitz on the segment @xmath544 , yields @xmath545 summarizing , under the assumptions of this step @xmath546 therefore , ( [ awhtd ] ) is shown and this step is concluded .",
    "consider now the situation when neither @xmath58 nor @xmath420 belong to the interior of any cross . in this case",
    ", we have that @xmath512 if @xmath514 , while @xmath547 if @xmath548 , and the same holds for @xmath420 .",
    "since @xmath5 is @xmath18 bi - lipschitz while @xmath320 is @xmath83 bi - lipschitz , the validity of  ( [ awhtd ] ) is obvious if both @xmath549 , as well as if both @xmath550 .",
    "therefore , we can just concentrate on the case in which @xmath551 .    in this case",
    ", the main observation is that @xmath552 , since both @xmath58 and @xmath420 must be at distance at least @xmath553 from any vertex @xmath354 , because they do not belong to any cross @xmath386 . as a consequence , again by  ( [ luiro ] ) we get @xmath554 while @xmath555 thus also in this case  ( [ awhtd ] ) is proven ( keep in mind that , since @xmath5 is a @xmath18 bi - lipschitz map , then of course @xmath556 ! ) . in particular , under the assumptions of this step one has @xmath557    we pass now to consider the case when @xmath58 belongs to some cross @xmath386 , while @xmath420 does not belong to the interior of any cross . in particular",
    ", we can assume that @xmath521 . to get the above estimate in  ( [ awhtd ] ) , it is enough to make a trivial geometric observation , namely , that there exists @xmath348 such that @xmath558 not necessarily with @xmath559 . as a consequence , we can use the estimate  ( [ step2 ] ) of step  ii for the points @xmath58 and @xmath560 which both belong to @xmath386 and the estimate  ( [ step3 ] ) of step  iii for the points @xmath560 and @xmath420 none of which belongs to the interior of some @xmath507 to get @xmath561 on the other hand , to get the below estimate in  ( [ awhtd ] ) , let us recall that by step  i we have @xmath562 since @xmath508 belongs to the radius @xmath563 , then an immediate geometric argument from  ( [ uffi2 ] ) implies , as already observed in  ( [ uffi ] ) , that @xmath564 thus , using the @xmath18 bi - lipschitz property of @xmath380 in the segment @xmath565 , and the estimate  ( [ step3 ] ) of step  iii for @xmath566 and @xmath420 , we get @xmath567 summarizing , under the assumptions of this step we have @xmath568 hence in particular  ( [ awhtd ] ) is again checked .",
    "the last situation which is left to consider is when @xmath58 and @xmath420 belong to two different crosses",
    ". this situation will be very similar to that of step  iv .",
    "indeed , for the above estimate in  ( [ awhtd ] ) we can again start observing that for some @xmath569 it must be @xmath570 then , we use the estimate  ( [ step2 ] ) of step  ii for the points @xmath571 , and the estimate  ( [ step4 ] ) of step  iv for the points @xmath572 and @xmath560 which does not belong to the interior of any cross getting @xmath573 finally , to find the below estimate in  ( [ awhtd ] ) we notice again that  ( [ alla ] ) holds true , and we use the @xmath18 bi - lipschitz property of @xmath380 in @xmath565 and the estimate  ( [ step4 ] ) of step  iv for @xmath566 and @xmath420 , obtaining @xmath574 thus , we have finally checked  ( [ awhtd ] ) in all the possible cases and the proof is concluded .",
    "in this last section we give a proof of theorem  [ mainaffine ] .",
    "in fact , the proof is quite short , since it is just a simple adaptation of the arguments of section  [ sect:2 ] .",
    "first of all , assume that @xmath2 is an @xmath459-right polygon and that @xmath5 is @xmath459-piecewise affine on @xmath13 according to definition  [ lastdef ] .",
    "then , as already underlined in remark  [ remfin ] , we can slightly modify the proofs of proposition  [ prop : lebappr ] and proposition  [ prop : lipext ] to get what follows .",
    "first of all , there exist some @xmath123 such that @xmath460 , an @xmath123-right polygon @xmath78 which is part of the @xmath123-tiling of @xmath2 , and an @xmath83 bi - lipschitz and piecewise affine function @xmath575 for which  ( [ luino ] ) , ( [ eq : lebappr3 ] ) , ( [ luiue ] ) and  ( [ luiro ] ) hold",
    ". moreover , there exists also a finitely piecewise affine map @xmath576 which is @xmath315 bi - lipschitz and which coincides with @xmath5 on @xmath22 and with @xmath320 on @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , gluing @xmath320 and @xmath321 exactly as in the proof of theorem  [ main ] , we immediately get the required @xmath315 bi - lipschitz and ( finitely ) piecewise affine approximation of @xmath5 .",
    "consider now the general situation of a polygon @xmath2 with a map @xmath5 which is piecewise affine on @xmath22 .",
    "of course , there exist a right polygon @xmath577 and a ( finitely ) piecewise affine and bi - lipschitz map @xmath578 , having bi - lipschitz constant @xmath579 .",
    "the map @xmath580 is a @xmath581 bi - lipschitz map from the right polygon @xmath577 to @xmath452 , which is piecewise affine on the boundary .",
    "then , we can apply the first part of the proof to get an approximation @xmath582 which is finitely piecewise affine and @xmath583 bi - lipschitz . finally , @xmath584 is a @xmath585 bi - lipschitz approximation of @xmath5 as desired .",
    "thus , the proof is concluded by setting @xmath586 .    [ depc ] observe that the ( best ) constant @xmath24 depends on the geometric features of @xmath2 , such as the minimum and the maximum angles of its boundary . however , by the construction above one has that @xmath587 whenever @xmath2 is a right polygon .",
