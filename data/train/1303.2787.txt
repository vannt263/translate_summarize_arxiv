    "pulsars which are famed by their highly periodic signals are now universally accepted as fast rotating and highly magnetized ( mainly dipolar ) neutron stars .",
    "the coherent curvature radiation due to the ultra - relativistic plasma streaming out along the open dipolar magnetic field lines is believed to be responsible for the pulsar radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the individual pulses from pulsars in general are highly random in strength as well as their appearance in longitude within the pulse window .",
    "however the average profiles resulted from the summation of several hundreds of individual pulses have well defined shapes , and they are unique in most of the cases .",
    "further pulsars in general show a `` s '' shaped characteristic polarization position angle ( ppa ) swing which is attributed to the underlying dipole field geometry of emission region @xcite .",
    "the average profiles in general are made up of many components .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have recognized that the pulsar emission beams have nested core - cone structure . but the conal components in general show asymmetry in their location with respect to the central core component .",
    "hence @xcite have suggested that the emission is ` patchy ' .",
    "the components often show asymmetry in their strengths between the leading and trailing sides of the profiles .",
    "further , some pulsars show the polarization angle that deviates from the standard ` s ' curve @xcite .    among the several relativistic effects that have been proposed to understand pulsar emission and polarization ,",
    "the effects of rotation such as aberration and retardation ( a / r ) and polar - cap current ( pc - current ) perturbation are found to be quite important . due to pulsar rotation",
    "the relativistic plasma gets corotation velocity component which is in addition to the intrinsic velocity along the dipole field lines .",
    "hence the net velocity of plasma will be aberrated in the direction of pulsar rotation . therefore ,",
    "an inertial observer tend to see the plasma trajectory which differs significantly from the associated dipole field lines , and hence affecting the pulsar emission and polarization ( blaskiewicz , cordes and wasserman 1991 , hereafter bcw 1991 ; dyks 2008 ; thomas & gangadhara 2007 ; thomas & gangadhara 2010 ; dyks et  al . 2010 ; thomas et al . 2010 ;",

    "the field lines will get curvature in the azimuthal direction due to the pc  current induced toroidal magnetic field which is in addition to their intrinsic curvature in the polar direction .",
    "therefore , the trajectory of field line constrained plasma becomes significantly different from the unperturbed case and hence affect the pulsar emission and polarization ( hibschman & arons 2001 ; gangadhara 2005 ; kumar & gangadhara 2012b , hereafter kg 2012b ) .    by taking into account of rotation ,",
    "@xcite have predicted that the ppa inflection point lags the midpoint of the intensity profile by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the light cylinder radius , and @xmath3 is the velocity of light and @xmath4 is the pulsar rotation period .",
    "later @xcite have confirmed this behavior .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that due to the combined effect of rotation , modulation and viewing geometry the phase lag of the ppa inflection point with respect to the central core will become significantly different from @xmath5 on the other hand , @xcite have predicted that the ppa inflection point can even lead the central core due to the pc  current - induced perturbation . note that an asymmetry in the phase location of components is believed to arise from the aberration and retardation effects @xcite .",
    "further , by considering the rotation @xcite have predicted that the leading side intensity components dominate over the trailing ones .",
    "this is due to the fact that the curvature of source trajectory on leading side becomes larger than that on the trailing side .",
    "later @xcite have confirmed this effect and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have reconfirmed this behavior .",
    "although , statistically the cases with leading component stronger are more common , the converse cases are also quite significant @xcite . by considering the pc  current - induced perturbation on the underlying dipole field @xcite have shown that the leading side components can get either stronger or weaker than the corresponding ones on trailing side depending upon the viewing geometry and modulation .",
    "however the aforementioned prediction by @xcite was in the absence of strong rotation effect .    in literature",
    "two types of circular polarization have been recognized : ` antisymmetric ' and ` symmetric ' .",
    "if the circular polarization changes its sense near the center of the pulse profile then it recognized as the antisymmetric@xmath0type circular polarization whereas if the polarity of the circular polarization does not change through out the pulse profile then it recognized as the symmetric@xmath0type @xcite .",
    "however , either antisymmetric or symmetric circular polarization can be associated with the individual components @xcite .",
    "earlier only the antisymmetric  type circular polarization was thought to be an intrinsic property of curvature radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the origin of ` symmetric'@xmath0type circular polarization was speculated to be through propagation effects .",
    "recently @xcite have shown however that in addition to the antisymmetric , the symmetric circular polarization can also be produced within the framework of curvature radiation if the effects of pulsar rotation , nonuniform plasma distribution and viewing geometry are taken into account .",
    "recently @xcite have also reconfirmed the findings of @xcite .",
    "@xcite deduced the similar result by considering pc - current induced perturbation instead of pulsar rotation .",
    "pulsars show a diverse behavior in circular polarization among which its association with the ppa swing is quite important for understanding the underlying geometry of emission region . in the case of pulsars with antisymmetric circular polarization ,",
    "@xcite have found a strong correlation between the sense reversal of circular polarization and the ppa swing : the sign reversal of circular polarization from negative to positive is associated with the increasing ppa sweep and vice versa .",
    "@xcite has confirmed the correlation and proposed it as a geometric phenomenon .",
    "further @xcite , from their simulation of polarization profiles , showed that the correlation exists when the rotation and pc - current perturbations are less significant .",
    "but @xcite,@xcite have noticed that the sense reversal of circular polarization near the center of pulse profiles is not correlated with the ppa swing .",
    "however , they did find a strong correlation between the sense of the circular polarization and the ppa swing in double@xmath0conal pulsars .",
    "@xcite speculated that such a correlation in the case of double@xmath0conal pulsars can arise if the modulations are asymmetrically located in the conal rings centered on the magnetic axis .    among the several relativistic models proposed by taking into account of pulsar rotation and pc - current perturbations ,",
    "only the models proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite can explain full polarization state of the radiation field .",
    "further they are much more realistic in the sense that in addition to strong perturbations the effects of nonuniform source distribution ( modulation ) and viewing geometry have been incorporated as an essential ingredients .",
    "however in the models proposed by @xcite and @xcite as a special case considered the effect of pulsar rotation and ignored pc  current perturbation . on the other hand , in yet another artificial case @xcite considered the effect of pc  current on the underlying dipole field by ignoring the corotation of the pulsar magnetosphere . since both the effects are found to be quite dominant in affecting pulsar radio emission and polarization , they have to be combined together .    in this paper both the rotation and pc ",
    "current perturbations are considered simultaneously , and analyzed their combined effect on the pulsar emission .",
    "if we consider separately the rotation and pc  current perturbations , and add up the results , the resulting conclusions can become erroneous as we show in next section and hence this work is an important one .",
    "although pulsar radiation is generated via some coherent processes , we perform the modeling of pulsar radio emission in terms of single particle curvature radiation . note that although to the first order the single particle approximation is not a bad assumption , but in reality some factors influencing the coherence processes may favor or oppose the effects that we consider in this work .",
    "we present the theory of single particle curvature radiation in a rotating pc  current perturbed magnetic field and analyze the polarization state in section  2 . in section  3",
    ", we present a set of simulated pulse profiles , and speculate on the polarization properties by comparing the observed pulses . in section  4 ,",
    "we give the discussions and in section  5 make the conclusion .",
    "let us consider a stationary cartesian coordinate system  xyz with the origin  o located at neutron star center as an inertial observer frame ( see figure  [ fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "consider an inclined and rotating pc  current perturbed magnetic dipole with an inclination angle @xmath6 with respect to the rotation axis @xmath7 which is taken to be parallel to z - axis .",
    "the velocity @xmath8 of the relativistic source @xmath9 which is constrained to move along the rotating pc  current perturbed dipole field line f , is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the unperturbed dipole field , @xmath14 is the pc  current - induced field , and @xmath15 is the position vector of the source @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 is the pulsar angular velocity and @xmath17 specifies the normalized speed of the source with respect to the speed of light c along the associated perturbed field line .",
    "the first term on the r.h.s .  of equation  ( [ eqn : v ] ) is the velocity of source along the perturbed field lines .",
    "the second term is the induced velocity due to corotation of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "note that due to the pc  current - perturbation , the field lines which lie above the magnetic axis , tend to azimuthally twist towards the pulsar rotation , whereas those which lie below the magnetic axis , twist in the opposite directions ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , the contributions to aberration of the source velocity @xmath8 by the above two terms add up for the negative sight line impact angle @xmath18 but they try to cancel each other for the positive @xmath19 however , since the aberration of source velocity due to the effect of rotation is larger than that due the pc  current - perturbation for the current which is of order goldreich - julian current , the net aberration will be always in the direction of pulsar rotation , and it is greater for negative @xmath19    since the relativistic emissions are beamed in the direction of velocity @xmath8 with half - opening angle @xmath20 observer can receive the emissions only from a selected emission region whose boundary satisfies @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the sight line @xmath23 with @xmath24 but the exact analytical solutions for the emission point coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see @xcite and @xcite for their definition ) of the beaming region are hard to find once the effects of rotation and pc  current perturbation are considered , and hence we seek numerical solutions .",
    "note that in finding exact values for coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 the values obtained from @xcite have to be used as initial guess values for fast convergence unlike @xcite wherein they have used those derived from @xcite .    by using the parameters @xmath29 @xmath30 s , source lorentz factor @xmath31 the current scale factor @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 we computed @xmath27 and @xmath28 and presented in figure  [ fig : figure2 ] as function of @xmath35 due to the pc  current perturbation alone ( represented by dotted line curves ) , the emission points in @xmath36 shift to later phases for positive @xmath37 and to the earlier phases for negative @xmath18 whereas they are mostly unaffected in @xmath38 on the other hand due to the effect of rotation ( aberration ) alone ( represented by dashed line curves ) , the emission shifts to earlier phases in both @xmath39 and @xmath40 however the phase shift of emission points in @xmath41 caused due to rotation alone is larger than that due to pc  current perturbation alone .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the phase shifts of the antisymmetric point of @xmath42 ( phase at which @xmath42 is equal to @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) indicated by arrows ( styled same as @xmath42 ) . as a result , in the more realistic case of rotating pc  current perturbed dipole ( represented by thick solid line curves ) , the emission points in @xmath39 shift to earlier phases in both the cases of @xmath37 by the same amount as that in the case of rotating dipole , whereas in @xmath45 they shift to the earlier phases by a smaller amount in the case of positive @xmath37 and by larger amount in the case of negative @xmath19 note that , if the emission region is modulated ( nonuniform source distribution ) in the azimuthal direction which we show later , then the resulted intensity components will also show aforesaid asymmetric phase shift between the positive and negative @xmath37 cases .",
    "we also computed @xmath46 and @xmath42 for the case of rotating perturbed dipole by assuming @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the coordinates of emission points in the nonrotating unperturbed dipole .",
    "the changes in the colatitude @xmath51 and @xmath52 and those in the azimuth @xmath53 and @xmath54 are due to the aberration and pc  current perturbation , respectively . the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the coordinates after separately considering the perturbations : rotation and pc  current , respectively , and",
    "similarly @xmath57 and @xmath58 we find that thus obtained @xmath46 and @xmath42 more or less match with the thick solid line curves ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "therefore , the phase shifts as well as the changes in the magnitude of emission point coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath42 due to the two separate perturbations ( rotation and pc  current ) , simply add up when the two effects are combined together .",
    "the acceleration of source is given by @xmath59 where we have used the expression of arc length of the field line @xmath60 and the total derivative @xmath61 where @xmath62 stands for @xmath63 @xmath64 etc .",
    "the first term on r.h.s .  of equation  ( [ eqn : a ] ) is the acceleration of bunch due to curvature of the pc  current perturbed field lines .",
    "note that it includes both the intrinsic curvature due to the dipolar field and the induced curvature due the pc - current perturbation on the dipole field .",
    "the small change in the source speed due to motion along the perturbed field line is represented by the second term and it is tiny among other terms .",
    "the third term is the rotationally induced acceleration due to the coriolis force and is in the direction of pulsar rotation .",
    "the last term is the induced acceleration due to the centrifugal force which is acting away from the rotation axis .",
    "the pc  current - induced acceleration which is included in the first term becomes much important at higher emission altitude , larger pulsar angular velocity , and smaller @xmath65 on the other hand , the coriolis and the centrifugal accelerations with the coriolis term being the dominant one become much important at higher emission altitude , larger pulsar angular velocity , but at larger @xmath65    by using the parameters , which are the same as in figure [ fig : figure1 ] , we computed the radius of curvature @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 , and plotted in upper panels of figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "the pc  current perturbation ( represented by the dotted line curves ) leads to larger curvature with respect the unperturbed ones ( thin solid line curve ) leaving the symmetric point of @xmath68 to be mostly unaffected @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", rotation induces an asymmetry into the curvature between the leading and trailing sides of @xmath69 since the leading side trajectory becomes more curved and @xmath68 maximum shifts to the trailing side ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the perturbation due to pc  current in the case of positive @xmath37 opposes that due to the corotation , the net @xmath68 in the rotating pc  current perturbed dipole ( thick solid line curve ) becomes larger than that due to rotation alone , and vice versa in the case of negative @xmath19    to assess the possibility of deriving @xmath68 for the rotating pc  current perturbed dipole by considering separately the perturbations due to pc  current and rotation , analogues to the @xmath46 and @xmath42 in figure  [ fig : figure2 ] , we considered the net curvature as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the curvature of the unperturbed dipolar field lines , @xmath72 and @xmath73 the @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the curvature vectors in the cases of rotating dipole and pc  current perturbed dipole , respectively .",

    "we can see that , it is significantly different from the actual @xmath68 of the rotating pc  current perturbed dipole .",
    "the polarization position angle @xmath84 of the electric field of radiation due to relativistic sources , defined as the angle between the radiation electric field and the projected spin axis on the plane of the sky , can be computed by knowing the acceleration of the radiation source : @xmath85 where @xmath86 ( projected spin vector ) and @xmath87 are unit vectors in the directions perpendicular to @xmath88 @xcite . by using the parameters which are same as in upper panels of figure [ fig : figure3 ] , we computed the position angle @xmath84 as a function of @xmath89 and plotted in lower panels of figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "the perturbation due to the pc  current ( represented by dotted line curves ) causes the @xmath84 curve to shift upward with respect to the standard rvm curve ( nonrotating dipole , thin solid line curve ) while its inflection point remain unaffected @xcite . on the other hand the rotation ( aberration ) causes the @xmath84 curve to shift upward or downward , depending upon sign of @xmath37 , and always shifts the inflection point to the trailing side .",
    "therefore in a more realistic case of rotating pc  current perturbed dipole the net @xmath84 will be shifted upward with respect to the one in rotating case , while the inflection point lies mostly at the same phase as in the rotating dipole .",
    "we have also computed @xmath84 for the rotating perturbed dipole by assuming @xmath90 where @xmath91 is due to the nonrotating dipole , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 are being the position angles after considering the perturbation separately due to rotation and pc  current , respectively .",

    "therefore we believe that the two effects have to be combined together in deducing the polarization state of the radiation field .",
    "the radiation emitted by the relativistic accelerating sources will have a broad spectrum , and it is given by @xcite : @xmath96}{\\xi^{2 } } e^{i \\omega (    t-\\hat{n}\\cdot \\textbf{r}/c ) } d\\theta .",

    "we solve the integral using the method given in @xcite and find the polarization state of the radiation field in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102      by assuming an uniform distribution of sources throughout the emission region , we computed the radiation field from the beaming region and its polarization state , and presented in figure  [ fig : figure4 ] . since the magnitude of rotation of contour patterns of the total intensity and the linear polarization in @xmath103 are more or less the same as that of the circular polarization , we present only the contour patterns of circular polarization",
    "however , the total intensity and linear polarization will be maximum at the beaming region center and fall considerably towards the boundary with a slightly larger emission towards the larger curvature region ( see figure  3 in * ? ? ?",

    "that is for the positive @xmath37 it is opposite to that due to the effect of rotation , whereas it is in the same direction for the negative @xmath19 however the magnitude of rotation of the contour patterns due to the pc  current is smaller than that due to the pulsar rotation . also , due to the pc  current , the positive polarity of the circular polarization becomes stronger than the negative polarity for both @xmath108 therefore , in the case of rotating pc  current perturbation ( panels @xmath109 ) , the rotation direction of the contour pattern of the circular polarization will be in the same direction as that in the panels @xmath110 and @xmath111 but with the lower magnitude of rotation for the positive @xmath37 than for negative @xmath19 further , due to the opposite selective enhancement of either the positive or negative polarity of the circular polarization by the two perturbations ( rotation and pc  current ) , the circular polarization becomes more or less have same strength between the positive and negative polarities , in similarity with the nonrotating case .",
    "emissions from the beaming region due to different plasma bunches will be incoherently added at the observation point if they are separated by a space larger than the radiation wavelength .",
    "hence , the resultant emission that the observer receives will be the sum of the intensities from the different plasma bunches . using the expressions given in (",
    "* from equation 33 to equation 36 ) , we computed the polarization state of the emitted radiation due to uniform distribution of sources , and they are presented in figure [ fig : figure5 ] . with the uniform distribution of sources , the pc  current perturbation alone ( represented by the dotted line curves ) does not affect the symmetry of the total intensity @xmath112 between the leading and trailing sides of @xmath113 which is similar to the nonrotating dipole , whereas the rotation introduces an asymmetry ( represented by the dashed line curves ) with the leading side becomes stronger due to an induced larger curvature of source trajectory on the leading side ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) . in the more realistic rotating",
    "perturbed dipole , there remains an asymmetry similar to the case of rotating dipole , however with the emission that is significantly differs from that in the cases of the rotating dipole and the pc  current perturbed dipole when considered separately .",

    "however , the profile of @xmath114 more or less matches with the corresponding @xmath115 the net survived circular polarization @xmath116 in the case of rotating perturbed dipole ( represented by the thick solid line curves ) becomes very tiny because of the two perturbations ( rotation and pc  current ) , which selectively enhance the opposite polarities of @xmath116 as shown in figure  [ fig : figure4 ] .",

    "although circular polarization of opposite polarities from the background unmodulated emission roughly cancels out , a net circular however with an asymmetry between the opposite polarities survives in the presence of modulation .",
    "this is because of an asymmetry in the magnitude of rotation of the emission pattern with respect to rotation phase in such a way that larger rotation magnitude towards the inner rotation phases as compared to that on outer phases @xcite .",

    "however , the asymmetry between the opposite polarities of the circular polarization becomes smaller for the positive @xmath37 than that for the negative @xmath19 this is due to an opposite behavior of pc  current in introducing an asymmetry between the opposite polarities of @xmath116 between the @xmath138 wherein it selectively enhances the trailing positive circular for @xmath139 whereas the leading positive circular for @xmath140 on the other hand pulsar rotation causes the selective enhancement of the leading polarity of @xmath141 i.e. , negative circular for @xmath139 and positive circular for @xmath140    to assess whether we can estimate the net phase shift of intensity components by adding the phase shift due to each perturbation computed separately , we chose emission altitude @xmath29 and two cases of modulation : narrower @xmath142 and broader @xmath143 the simulated pulses are presented in figure  [ fig : figure7 ] .",

    "this is due to an increased asymmetry in the magnitude of rotation of beaming region emission pattern between the inner and outer phases wherein the small amount of rotation occurs at the outer phases . in the case of @xmath158 only the leading negative polarity of the circular polarization survives due to aforementioned reasons but this time it is enhanced more due to broader modulation and hence broader pulse width .",
    "hence it results in the `` symmetric''-type circular polarization .    as a case of modulation which lies symmetrically on either side of the meridional plane",

    "although an observer encounters mostly the same plasma density ( modulation strength ) between the leading and trailing sides , the net modulated intensity component on the trailing side becomes weaker than that on the leading side due to the induced larger curvature of source trajectory on the leading side .",
    "further the leading side component becomes broader than the trailing one due to an induced asymmetry in the sight line encountered modulation and that in the gradient of radius of curvature .",
    "the behaviors of linear and circular polarization are same as in the figure [ fig : figure6 ] except the enhancement of trailing part of the circular polarization in the trailing side components .      by considering a modulation with plasma density gradient in the polar direction we present the effects of rotation and pc  current perturbation on pulsar emission and polarization . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure9 ] , we present the simulation of hallow cone emissions surrounding the magnetic axis with modulation peak at @xmath163 since the minimum of @xmath46 is about @xmath164 which is about @xmath165 for @xmath34 observer s sight line cuts the hollow cone emission only once in each pulsar rotation , and hence it results in a single component profile . for the sake of comparison , the cases of before and after consideration of the perturbations are all shown in the figure [ fig : figure9 ] , and the parameters normalization and",

    "note that , unlike the case of azimuthally modulated emissions ( see figure [ fig : figure6 ] ) , the maximum of modulation strength that the observer encounters in the lab frame is not same in all the cases as the minimum of @xmath46 slightly get affected due to the perturbations .",
    "but , similar to the case of figure [ fig : figure6 ] , the emissions get affected significantly before and after considering the perturbations due to the induced differences in @xmath68 at the peak locations of @xmath166 the net phase shifts of a component after combining the two perturbations in the cases of @xmath137 are found to be @xmath167 and @xmath168 respectively . on the other hand the net phase shift obtained by adding the phase shifts due to the rotation and pc  current when considered separately in the cases of @xmath137",
    "are found to be @xmath169 and @xmath170 respectively .",
    "hence the relative differences are about @xmath133 and @xmath171 respectively with respect to the combined case of the perturbations .",
    "note that this relative differences in the intensity phase shifts become larger at higher altitude @xmath172    the maximum of normalized linear polarization @xmath114 is more or less the same in all the cases , similar to figure [ fig : figure6 ] .",
    "although the position angle significantly gets affected after combining the two perturbations , its inflection point lies at roughly the same phase as that due to the rotation alone .",
    "the circular polarization @xmath116 becomes symmetric type with the opposite polarities survive due to an opposite direction of rotation of emission pattern in the beaming region .",
    "the net circular polarization after combining the two perturbations will also be symmetric type with the survival of polarity as that due to the pulsar rotation alone .    by considering a hallow cone modulation with peak at @xmath173",
    "we have analyzed a case where the sight line cuts the hallow cone emission twice ( see figure [ fig : figure10 ] ) .",
    "similar to figure [ fig : figure8 ] , the trailing side intensity component become weaker as well as narrower than that on the leading side , due to the induced asymmetry in the curvature of source trajectories between the two sides . since the sight line crosses the central maximum of the hallow cone on both the leading and trailing sides",
    ", there is a change over of selective enhancement of emission over the part of the beaming region with smaller values of @xmath39 to that over the larger values @xmath39 on the leading side , and vice versa on the trailing side .",
    "hence , there results an antisymmetric circular polarization with the sign reversal from positive to negative over in leading side component and vice versa on the trailing side for the case of positive @xmath19 on the other hand , it is vice versa for the case of negative @xmath37 due to the opposite direction of rotation of the emission pattern of the beaming region .      the radiation sources may be nonuniformly distributed in both the polar and azimuthal directions in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the extreme cases , wherein the modulation is predominant in azimuthal or polar directions are already discussed in sections @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively . in this section",

    "@xmath157 the emission and polarization properties are similar to the case of @xmath181 and @xmath160 of figure [ fig : figure6 ] with an antisymmetric circular polarization wherein the sign reversal is from the negative polarity to the positive . on the other hand even though the single modulation is considered in the case of @xmath177 and @xmath178 but due to the viewing geometry , much elongation of the modulation in the azimuthal direction and squeezing into a narrow cone , the modulation encountered by the sight line results in a blended two components like structure .",
    "it further results into a two components like structure in intensity profile , however , with much weaker trailing side due to the larger @xmath182 although circular polarization is still antisymmetric type , the sign reversal becomes opposite to the case of @xmath176 and @xmath157 i.e. , from positive to negative , which is similar to the case of @xmath181 and @xmath160 in figure [ fig : figure9 ] .",
    "hence in the presence of perturbations , it is hard to see the correlation between the sign reversal of circular polarization and the ppa swing as both the types of circular sign reversal seems to be associated with the increasing ppa swing .",
    "note that , the inflection point of ppa swing is not derived in the case of @xmath177 and @xmath178 due to the difficulty in finding it because of the kinky nature in the ppa swing .    by using @xmath162 @xmath183 and the rest parameters the same as in figure [ fig : figure11 ] , we computed the polarization profiles and plotted in figure [ fig : figure12 ] . in both cases of modulation ,",
    "the profiles are similar to those in figure [ fig : figure11 ] except with the opposite sign reversal of the circular polarization in the respective cases and decreasing ppa swing . also , similar to figure [ fig :",

    "@xmath190 observer misses out the trailing side modulation and hence only the leading side component shows up , whereas in the case @xmath191 it becomes vice versa . for third column , we used the combined modulation that are used in the first two columns ( four gaussian modulations ) .",
    "even though observer encounters a weaker modulation on the leading side , due to larger curvature on the leading side the component on the leading side becomes stronger than the corresponding one on trailing side .",
    "but in the case of last column panels , observer encounters even weaker modulation on the leading side than on the trailing side as compared to the case of third column .",
    "hence the resultant leading side component becomes weaker than the corresponding trailing side one .",

    "the poloidal pc  current perturbs the underlying dipole field by inducing a toroidal magnetic field @xcite whereas the pulsar rotation causes the bending of trajectory of the field line constrained plasma in the direction of pulsar rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "current along with modulation can shift the intensity to trailing side and the ppa inflection point to the leading side for the positive @xmath18 and vice versa for negative @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the influences of the rotation and pc  current adds up for the negative @xmath37 but cancel each other when @xmath37 is positive . note",
    "that the opposite behavior of rotation and pc  current in the case of positive @xmath37 is due to the opposite directions of induced curvature caused by the two perturbations .",
    "although the effects of rotation and pc  current perturbation can be understand qualitatively when they are combined together , their quantitative estimate becomes impossible when the two effects are considered separately as shown in sections @xmath192 and @xmath193 however , since the influence of rotation is mostly larger than that of the pc  current , in the combined cases mostly the effects of rotation prevail with quite different magnitudes . for example , the phase delay between the ppa inflection point and the central component of pulse profile becomes much smaller for the positive @xmath37 as compared to that for the negative @xmath37 ( see figure [ fig : figure6 ] ) .",
    "hence the above said phase delays greatly depend on the geometric parameters which has not been reported in the literature .    even though the curvature of source trajectory on the leading side becomes larger than that on the trailing side due to the perturbation caused by the rotation and pc  current considered together , the net modulated intensity can become stronger either on the leading side or on the trailing side ( see figures [ fig : figure13 ] and [ fig : figure14 ] ) depending upon the modulation location and the viewing geometry .",
    "statistically , although there is an observational support for the leading side component dominating over the trailing one , the other contrary cases are also reported @xcite .",

    "@xcite , by considering the pc  current alone , also have predicted above behavior in the absence of strong rotation effect .",
    "however by considering effect of pulsar rotation on the field line constrained plasma alone , @xcite have predicted that the leading side intensity dominate over the trailing side and later @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have arrived at the same conclusion .",
    "the `` partial cone '' pulsars , which show either missing or much suppressed side in their conal double component profiles @xcite can be result due to the rotation and pc  current perturbation ( see figures [ fig : figure13 ] and [ fig : figure14 ] ) .",
    "further the rotation and pc - current perturbation introduce an asymmetry into the width of components between the leading and trailing sides in such a way that the leading side components become broader than the corresponding trailing ones , and it has an observational support too @xcite .",
    "this is due to an induced asymmetry in the steepness of radius of curvature with respect to the rotation phase wherein the trailing side @xmath68 becomes more steeper than that on the leading side . @xcite and",

    "the rotation and pc  current significantly introduce an asymmetry into the strengths of opposite polarities of the circular polarization . when they are considered separately",
    ", they selectively enhance either the negative or positive polarities .",
    "further the two effects cause the emission pattern to rotate in @xmath194plane in the opposite directions for positive @xmath37 and in same direction for negative @xmath19 hence it results in smaller rotation of the emission pattern in @xmath194plane for the positive @xmath37 case than that for the negative @xmath19 however due to the rotation of the emission pattern , the symmetric type circular polarization becomes evident in addition to the more common antisymmetric type with an usual asymmetry between the opposite polarities in presence of nonuniform distribution of sources ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "due to perturbations we find the sign reversal of circular polarization from negative to positive near the center of pulse profile can be associated with either the increasing or decreasing ppa swing , and similarly the vice versa ( see figures [ fig : figure11 ] and [ fig : figure12 ] ) , and these deductions are found to be in accordance with @xcite and @xcite observational findings .",
    "our simulations ( see figures [ fig : figure13 ] and [ fig : figure14 ] ) also confirm @xcite and @xcite findings that the negative polarity of the circular polarization is associated with increasing ppa and vice versa for positive polarity on both the sides of conal - double pulsars profiles .",
    "this is possible due to combined rotation and pc - current perturbation under specific conditions that when the modulation is more effective in the polar direction than in azimuthal direction .",

    "however , the results of @xcite were in the absence of any perturbation and hence the ppa distortions from the standard ` s ' curve are smaller . @xcite",
    "have speculated that if the radio emission has a varying emission height across the pulse profile then ppa swing will be nonuniform .",
