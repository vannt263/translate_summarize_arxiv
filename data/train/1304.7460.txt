    "quantum mechanical laws apply to single particles , complex molecules involving tens of atoms as well as to living organisms  @xcite .",
    "recently , the first optical almost - loophole - free bell tests for a two - photon singlet , eliminating the famous detection loophole , have been performed by the zeilinger and kwiat groups  @xcite .",
    "can this also be demonstrated for systems with higher mean photon numbers using the current technology ?",
    "an indisputable bell test  @xcite ultimately rejects the local realistic description of the world in favor of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is also of practical importance allowing for implementation of quantum technology protocols such as device - independent quantum key distribution ( qkd )  @xcite , randomness generation  @xcite and reduction of communication complexity  @xcite .",
    "the detection loophole arises from inefficient ( lossy ) photo - detection .",
    "the local realistic models do not necessarily satisfy the fair sampling assumption and they might exploit the postselection , i.e discarding some of the experimental data , to mimic the violation of a bell inequality . closing the detection loophole for a two - photon singlet was possible due to employment of the superconducting transition edge sensors  @xcite , the quantum detectors with a near - perfect efficiency",
    ". however , if we examined states of light involving large number of photons , elimination of this loophole would be more involved since the imperfect ( coarse - grained ) measurements come into play  @xcite .",
    "quantum phenomena on the macroscopic scale have been intriguing and puzzling to the physicists since the inception of the quantum theory .",
    "recently , macroscopically populated entangled states of light became available experimentally : the micro - macro polarization singlet  @xcite , entangled bright squeezed vacuum  @xcite , and displaced single - photon path - entangled state  @xcite .",
    "an important question of possibility of performing a loophole - free bell test  @xcite for these state has been posed .",
    "the probability of no - detection event for these states is very low .",
    "this property gives hope to close the detection loophole .",
    "@xcite we showed that if the postselection is simply omitted , the micro - macro polarization state fails to pass the bell test with efficient coarse - grained ( binary ) analog detection , although the loophole is closed .",
    "we also emphasized that preselection can solve this problem ( it improves the visibility ( distinguishability ) of the multi - photon qubit in analog detection  @xcite ) , but we did not provide any example to support our claim .",
    "however , the considerations in  @xcite contradict this statement : the authors showed that all so far tested preselections are not useful for increasing the distiguishability of the micro - macro polarization singlet in analog detection .",
    "additionelly , the results in refs .",
    "@xcite emphasized the significance of the detection loophole for the test of macroscopic entanglement discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : it was demonstrated that in presence of this loophole separable states may falsely reveal entanglement .",
    "moreover , in ref .  @xcite it was demonstrated that a single photon resolution is essential in observing the micro - macro entanglement with photon counting measurements .    here , we examine a loophole(postselection)-free chsh - bell inequality test with preselected unsymmetrical polarization singlet states of light of a general form and imperfect binary analog detection .",
    "we explicitly show an example of preselection scheme which improves violation of the chsh inequality with the micro - macro polarization singlet produced by the optimal quantum cloning .    in the unsymmetrical singlets under consideration ,",
    "one of the modes is occupied by a single photon ( the micro - qubit ) , whereas the second one contains a pair of mutually orthogonal multi - photon states ( the multi - photon qubit ) .",
    "we assume that the average photon number in the multi - photon qubit can be controlled by some external parameter in an experimental setup , and it may vary from a single photon to the macroscopic quantity of thousands of photons .",
    "furthermore , we consider a bell test based only on linear optical elements .",
    "the unsymmetrical singlet is prepared before the test by a special filtering procedure applied to the mode containing the multi - photon state .",
    "the filter is described by a povm ( positive operator valued measure ) .",
    "for example , it may be realized by the modulus of intensity difference filter  @xcite .",
    "filtering belongs to the conditional state preparation , not to the test . only if the state is successfully preselected , the bell test is performed where every measurement outcome is conclusive and is taken into account",
    "this eliminates the necessity of data postselection and closes the detection loophole .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss a general scenario of the chsh - bell inequality test with preselection strategy for an unsymmetrical singlet .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to a short summary of the experimentally available unsymmetrical polarization singlets of light .",
    "we further discuss the chsh inequality violation for these states preselected by the special case of the modulus of intensity difference filter , namely the corner filter , in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible future steps towards genuine loophole - free bell test for states of light with large photon population .",
    "+    the bell inequality test with an unsymmetrical singlet state and imperfect intensity measurements has to employ a preselection strategy  @xcite .",
    "the role of preselection is to prevent from deterioration of the ability to witness quantum correlations in the singlet state , resulting from coarse - graining measurements .",
    "we call the singlet unsymmetrical if the dimensions of the hilbert spaces corresponding to its modes are unequal .",
    "let us start our discussion with a two - mode unsymmetrical polarization singlet state of a general form @xmath0 and an arbitrary preselection strategy executed by a povm @xmath1 .",
    "the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote a micro - qubit , e.g. a single photon in polarization @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , whereas @xmath6 and @xmath7 are multi - photon states which constitute a multi - photon qubit . of course , the two states of the qubits are pairwise orthogonal @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "a setup for the bell test is depicted in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",
    "the multi - photon part of the state ( mode b ) impinges on a beam splitter ( bs ) with a low reflectivity @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath11 , which taps only a small fraction of the state leaving it almost unaffected .",
    "next , the preselection strategy is implemented by the analysis of the reflected part : it is examined by a filter described by a povm @xmath1 and the result is feed forwarded to the transmitted beam .",
    "this procedure belongs to conditional state preparation before the test .",
    "after the successful preselection , the bell test consists of polarization rotations , by the angles @xmath12 , @xmath13 on mode @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 on mode @xmath17 , and intensity measurements of polarization components of both modes .    in general , the operator @xmath1 may suffer from lack of the rotational invariance being an important property of the original singlet and thus , the form of the preselected state may be basis dependent .",
    "for example , for the modulus of intensity difference filter it is known that it improves the visibility of a multi - photon state for a measurement in one polarization basis but deteriorates for measurements in the other polarization bases .",
    "thus , such filtering strategies are believed to be useless for preselection  @xcite .",
    "this problem arises if the usual settings for the chsh - bell inequality are considered : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "however , it does not need to be the case if nonorthogonal polarization directions in measurements on the multi - photon mode are chosen , at the expense of obtaining a non - maximal bell inequality violation .",
    "moreover , the visibility is not the only factor contributing to the chsh - bell parameter computed for an unsymmetrical singlet .",
    "the other parameter is a quantity which we call antivisibility and we explain its physical meaning below . in order to maximize the value of the bell violation",
    ", the rotation angles on the multi - photon mode should optimize the two parameters simultaneously .",
    "we consider the chsh inequality with bell parameter @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the correlation function where one observer , alice , measures the microscopic part ( mode a ) and the other , bob , measures the multi - photon part of the singlet ( mode b ) .",
    "we assume the ideal measurement operator @xmath24 for the microscopic qubit .",
    "rotating the polarization of the microscopic part by an angle @xmath12 yields @xmath25 which allows expressing the micro observable in terms of the projectors in the reference basis @xmath26 @xmath27 for the multi - photon mode we take the binary threshold detection operator @xmath28 adapted to the preselection strategy @xmath1 . the value @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is assigned to this observable when the state @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is identified .",
    "we assume it belongs to a class of diagonal observables such that @xmath31 .",
    "the general form of such observable reads @xmath32 where the condition @xmath33 is such that it ensures the observable to be traceless .",
    "after a short algebra , we obtain the correlation function for the state in eq .",
    "( [ micro - macro - singlet1 ] ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the visibility and @xmath36 is called the antivisibility of the state @xmath37 preselected in the polarization basis @xmath38 and observed in the polarization basis @xmath15 .",
    "the antivisibility quantifies the ability of the observable @xmath28 to erase the information on which state of @xmath39 or @xmath40 entered the detector . in this derivation , due to the condition @xmath31",
    ", we noticed that @xmath41 . without the loss of generality",
    ", we also took that @xmath42 is real - valued .",
    "after inserting eq .",
    "( [ correlation ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ bell ] ) we obtain @xmath43    we will first consider the following rotation angles @xmath44 for preselection and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 for the bell test .",
    "this choice is quite natural because in the limit of a small photon population in mode @xmath17 , i.e. for a two - photon singlet , these are the optimal angles maximizing the value of the chsh - bell parameter with @xmath48 .",
    "later , we will show that for the specific examples we examined it is also the optimal set of angles even for amplified mode @xmath17 however , the optimal value of @xmath15 ( @xmath49 ) changes with the mean number of photons in multi - photon qubit in presence of preselection . in this case , the bell parameter reads @xmath50 due to the diagonal form of the multi - photon observable , the visibility and antivisibility can be expressed as a convex sum of contributions resulting from various photon - number sectors @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are computed for the @xmath54th photon - number sector of a multi - photon qubit ( we can always decompose multi - photon states in the fock basis as follows @xmath55 with @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are certain probability amplitudes ) . thus , similar decomposition holds true for the bell parameter @xmath59 decompositions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : decomposition ] ) and ( [ eq : bell_decomposition ] ) give insight into the contribution of each sector separately by taking into account the structure of the multi - photon qubit .",
    "due to that we know which photon numbers lead to the bell violation most and which deteriorate it .",
    "the above formula may be further simplified by noticing that when @xmath58 and @xmath60 fulfill additional conditions , e.g.  @xmath61 and @xmath62 for odd @xmath63 but @xmath64 and @xmath65 for even @xmath63 , then @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( see appendix  a ) . in this case it is possible to write eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell_decomposition ] ) as @xmath68 .",
    "in this section we will discuss a specific example of the experimentally available unsymmetrical polarization singlet states of light .",
    "they are produced in the process of the phase - covariant optimal quantum cloning .",
    "it is based on phase sensitive parametric amplification  @xcite and requires a pair of linearly polarized photons in a standard singlet state , obtained through parametric down conversion , as an input .",
    "the single photon seeding is coherently amplified to produce a multi - photon state , by an intensely pumped high gain g nonlinear medium ( the cloner ) .",
    "the equatorial states of the poincar sphere of all polarization states , parametrized by the polar angle @xmath69 , are privileged for the phase - covariant cloners . only for this subspace",
    "their hamiltonian @xmath70 is rotationally invariant and they work equally well for all the equatorial states .",
    "the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the creation operators for the equatorial polarization modes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively and @xmath73 is the coupling strength , proportional to the pumping power .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the equatorial polarization state subspace for the seeding photon .",
    "the subspace basis is set by two states , @xmath74 and its orthogonal counterpart @xmath75 , where @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) denote @xmath54 ( @xmath78 ) photons polarized horizontally ( vertically ) and @xmath79 .",
    "due to its rotational invariance , we express the initial singlet in this basis @xmath80 .",
    "cloning is a unitary process and the original two - photon entanglement is transferred to the unsymmetrical singlet with latexmath:[\\ ] ] which implies @xmath262 and therefore @xmath263 .",
    "again , it is consistent with the condition derived in appendix  a , because for the same number of photons in both polarizations , probability amplitudes in @xmath264 and @xmath265 have the same modules and opposite signs . finally , the bell parameter ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : bell_any_angles ] ) ) can be simplified for angles @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath266 and @xmath47 to @xmath267 where @xmath268    the formulas in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phip])-([bell - preselected ] ) hold true also for the bell test without preselection . in this case , the condition @xmath269 is always fulfilled and @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 and @xmath275 ."
