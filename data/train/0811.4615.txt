    "the goal of this paper is to construct an extension of the kontsevich integral @xmath0 of knots to knotted trivalent graphs .",
    "the extension is a universal finite type invariant of knotted trivalent graphs , which commutes with natural operations that are defined on the space of graphs , as well as on the target space of @xmath0 .",
    "these operations are changing the orientation of an edge ; deleting an edge ; unzipping an edge ( an analogue of cabling of knots ) ; and connected sum .",
    "one reason this is interesting is that several knot properties ( such as genus , unknotting number and ribbon property , for example ) are definable with short formulas involving knotted trivalent graphs and the above operations .",
    "therefore , such an operation - respecting invariant yields algebraic necessary conditions for these properties , i.e. equations in the target space of the invariant .",
    "this idea is due to dror bar - natan , and is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the extension of @xmath0 is the first example for such an invariant .",
    "unfortunately , the target space of z is too complicated for it to be useful in a computational sense .",
    "however , we hope that by finding sufficient quotients of the target space more computable invariants could be born .",
    "the construction also provides an algebraic description of the kontsevich integral ( of knots and graphs ) , due to the fact that knotted trivalent graphs are finitely generated , i.e. there s a finite ( small ) set of graphs such that any knotted trivalent graph can be obtained from these using the above operations .",
    "this is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "since the extension commutes with the operations , it is enough to compute it for the graphs in the generating set .",
    "as knots are special cases of knotted trivalent graphs , this also yields an algebraic description of the kontsevich integral of knots .",
    "@xmath0 was first extended to knotted trivalent graphs by murakami and ohtsuki in @xcite .",
    "when one tries to extend @xmath0 naively , replacing knots by knotted graphs in the definition , the result is neither convergent nor an isotopy invariant .",
    "thus , one needs to apply renormalizations to make it converge , and corrections to make it invariant .",
    "murakami and ohtsuki use the language of q - tangles ( parenthesized tangles ) , building on a significant body of knowledge about drinfeld s associators to prove that the extension is a well - defined invariant .",
    "an other extension was constructed in 2007 by d. cheptea and t. q. t. le in @xcite , using even associators .",
    "they prove that their extension is an isotopy invariant ( in part building on @xcite for this part ) , and that it commutes with orientation switches and edge deletions and is unique if certain local properties are required -in this sense it is the strongest .",
    "they also conjecture that it coincides with murakami and ohtsuki s construction .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is eliminate the black box quality of the extended invariants , which results partly from the depth of the ingredients that go into them , and partly from the fact that the proofs needed for the constructions are spread over several papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our construction differs from previous ones in that we build the corrected extension step by step on the naive one . after renormalizations to make the extension convergent , non - invariance errors arise .",
    "we fix some of these by introducing counter terms ( corrections ) that are precisely the inverses of the errors , and we show that thanks to some `` syzygies '' , i.e. dependencies between the errors , all the other errors get corrected automatically .",
    "the proofs involve mainly elementary kontsevich integral methods and combinatorial considerations .    as a result",
    ", we get a series of different corrections that all yield knotted graph invariants .",
    "one of these is the murakami - ohtsuki invariant .",
    "we note that as a special case , our construction also produces an associator .",
    "since the construction has many details and there s a risk of the main ideas getting lost among them , section 2 is an `` executive summary '' of the key points and important steps .",
    "all the details are omitted here , and follow later in the paper .",
    "the purpose of this section is to emphasize what is important and to provide an express lane to those familiar with the topic .    in an effort to make the construction and the inner workings of",
    "@xmath0 as transparent as possible , section 3 is dedicated to reviewing the relevant results for the kontsevich integral of knots .",
    "we state all the results that we need , mostly with proofs .",
    "the reason for reproducing the proofs is that we need to modify some of them for the results to carry over to graphs , therefore understanding the knot case is crucial for the readability of the paper .",
    "our main reference is a nice exposition by chmutov and duzhin , @xcite .",
    "this is the source of any theorems and proofs in section 2 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we also use results from bar - natan s paper @xcite , which is another good reference for the kontsevich integral of knots in general .",
    "other references include kontsevich s original paper @xcite .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to defining the necessary framework for the extension and trying ( and failing ) to naively extend @xmath0 to graphs .    in section 5",
    "we use a baby versions of a renormalization technique from quantum field theory to eliminate the divergence that occurs in the case of the naive extension , and prove that the resulting not - quite - invariant has some promising properties .",
    "the bulk of the difficulty lies in section 6 , where we need to find the appropriate correction factors to make the extension an isotopy invariant .",
    "this involves some computations and a series of combinatorial considerations , but is done in a fairly elementary way overall .",
    "it will turn out that the result will almost , but not quite commute with the unzip operation ( and this will happen for any invariant that commutes with edge deletion ) , so we need to renormalize the unzip operation to get a fully well behaved invariant .",
    "i am greatly indebted to my advisor , dror bar - natan , for suggesting this project to me , weekly helpful discussions , and proofreading this paper several times .",
    "this section contains the main points of the construction , but no details .",
    "all the details will follow later in the paper .",
    "trivalent graphs are graphs with three vertices joining at each vertex .",
    "we allow multiple edges , loops , and circles with no vertices .",
    "knotted trivalent graphs are embeddings of trivalent graphs into @xmath1 , modulo isotopy .",
    "we require all edges to be oriented and framed .",
    "there are four operations of knotted trivalent graphs : orientation switch , edge deletion , edge unzip , and connected sum .",
    "when deleting an edge , two vertices cease to exist .",
    "unzip is an analogue of cabling , as shown :    unzip.pstex_t    connected sum depends on choices of edges to connect , and produces two new vertices :    connsum.pstex_t    the kontsevich integral of knots is defined by the following integral formula :    kintegral.pstex_t    @xmath2    we naively generalize this to knotted trivalent graphs ( or trivalent tangles ) , by simply putting graphs in the picture and applying the same formula .",
    "the integral now takes its values in chord diagrams on trivalent graph `` skeletons '' .",
    "these are , just like ordinary chord diagrams , factored out by the @xmath3 relation , and one additional relation , called vertex invariance , or vi :    vi.pstex_t ,    where the sign @xmath4 is @xmath5 if the edge the chord is ending on is oriented to be outgoing from the vertex , and @xmath6 if it s incoming .",
    "we do not mod out by the one term relation , since we do nt want the invariant to be framing - independent .",
    "the naively defined extension has promising properties : it preserves the factorization property ( multiplicativity ) of the ordinary kontsevich integral , and it is invariant under horizontal deformations that leave the critical points and vertices fixed .",
    "it holds promise to be a universal finite type invariant of knotted trivalent graphs .",
    "but , unfortunately , it is divergent .",
    "the divergence is caused by `` short chords '' near the critical points ( since we did nt factor out by the one term relation , which saved us in the knot case ) , and short chords near the vertices ( which cause a divergence the same way , but we do nt have any reason to factor them out ) .",
    "we fix this by a technique borrowed from quantum field theory : we know exactly what the divergence is , so we `` multiply by its inverse '' .    we choose a fixed scale @xmath7 and open up the strands at each vertex and critical point to width @xmath7 , at a small distance @xmath8 from the vertex , as shown for a vertex of a @xmath9 shape :    renormalize.pstex_t    we compute the integral using this picture instead of the original one .",
    "we only allow chords between the dotted parts , but not chords coming from far away ending on them .",
    "the renormalized integral is the limit of this quantity as @xmath8 tends to zero .",
    "we do the same for vertices of a @xmath10 shape , and critical points .",
    "we will have to insist that we embed the graph in a way that only contains vertices of either @xmath9 or @xmath10 shapes ( i.e , either one edge is locally above the vertex and two are below , creating a @xmath9-shape , or two are above and one below , creating a @xmath10-shape .",
    "we do not allow a vertex that is a local minimum or maximum at the same time .",
    ") there is of course such an embedding in any isotopy class , however , this will cause some invariance issues later .",
    "the renormalized version is convergent ( this is easy to prove ) , it retains the good properties of the naive extension , and it is invariant under rigid motions of critical points and vertices ( i.e. deformations that do not change the number of critical points or the @xmath9/@xmath10 type of the vertices ) .",
    "there are natural orientation switch , edge delete , edge unzip , and connected sum operations defined on the chord diagrams on graph skeletons , and the renormalized integral commutes with all these operations .",
    "furthermore , it has sensible behavior under changing the scale @xmath7 : an easy computation shows that the value of @xmath0 will get multiplied by a simple exponential factor ( a chord diagram on two strands ) at all vertices and critical points .",
    "the problem with the renormalized integral is that it is far from being an isotopy invariant : it does not tolerate deformations changing the number of critical points ( `` straightening humps''- the same problem arises in case of the ordinary kontsevich integral ) , or changing the shape of the vertices .",
    "similar to the knot case , but more complicated , we will have to introduce corrections to make @xmath0 an invariant .",
    "there are four `` correctors '' available : we can put prescribed little chord diagrams on each minimum , maximum , @xmath9-vertex , and @xmath10-vertex .",
    "we will call these @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "there are eight moves needed for the isotopy invariance of @xmath0 :",
    "moves.pstex_t    it s not hard to check that these are enough .",
    "to simplify , we use five syzygies that reduce the number of moves :    syzygies.pstex_t    for example , the first syzygy tells us that once z is invariant under move @xmath13 , it is automatically invariant under move @xmath14 .",
    "the second says that moves @xmath13 and @xmath15 imply @xmath16 , etc . in the end , we have reduced the problem to making @xmath0 invariant under moves @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "the moves translate to equations between the correctors @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    we know how to solve the equation corresponding to move @xmath13 , as this was done even in the knot case .",
    "the most difficult step is solving equations @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "these are obviously not independent , since the leftmost and rightmost sides are mirror images , and the kontsevich integral of a mirror image is the mirror image .",
    "however , it is not true that any set of corrections that fix move @xmath15 will fix move @xmath17 automatically ( i.e. there s no missing syzygy ) .",
    "what we need to do is to solve the two equations simultaneously .",
    "we achieve this by showing that moves @xmath15 and @xmath17 are equivalent to the following equations of chord diagrams : @xmath18 where we `` compute '' @xmath19 explicitly , i.e. we express it as the renormalized kontsevich integral of the simple tangle .",
    "this is a fairly elementary , but tricky computation .",
    "all we use about @xmath19 for the invariance though is that it is mirror symmetric , which is obvious from its definition .",
    "( we use more of its properties later . )",
    "looking at the above equations there s an obvious set of corrections that will make @xmath0 an isotopy invariant : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 , where @xmath12 is determined by @xmath11 the same way it is in the knot case .",
    "some attention needs to be paid to edge orientations , to make sure @xmath0 commutes with orientation switches .    to show that the resulting invariant commutes with edge delete and connected sum , we use another property of @xmath19 that is almost obvious from its expression as a value of @xmath0 .    by rearranging the equations",
    ", we produce a one - parameter family of corrections all yielding isotopy invariants , one of these is the set of corrections used by murakami and ohtsuki .    finally , we show that unfortunately , no invariant will commute at the same time with the edge delete and edge unzip operations , as they are defined , so we renormalize the unzip operation to make @xmath0 fully well - behaved .",
    "this amounts to observing what the error is and multiplying by its inverse .",
    "the reference for everything in this section , unless otherwise stated , is @xcite .",
    "the theory of finite type ( or vassiliev ) invariants grew out of the idea of v. vassiliev to extend knot invariants to the class of singular knots . by a singular knot we mean a knot with a finite number of simple ( transverse ) double points .",
    "the extension of a knot invariant @xmath25 follows the rule    @xmath26    a _ finite type ( vassiliev ) invariant _ is a knot invariant whose extension vanishes on all knots with more than @xmath12 double points , for some @xmath27 .",
    "the smallest such @xmath12 is called the _ order _ , or _ type _ of the invariant .",
    "the set of all vassiliev invariants forms a vector space @xmath28 , which is filtered by the subspaces @xmath29 , the vassiliev invariants of order at most @xmath12 :    @xmath30    this filtration allows us to study the simpler associated graded space :    @xmath31    the components @xmath32 are best understood in terms of _ chord diagrams_.    a _ chord diagram _ of order @xmath12 is a circle with a set of n _ chords _ all of whose endpoints are distinct ( see the figure below ) . the actual shape of the chords and the exact position of endpoints are irrelevant , we are only interested in the pairing they define on the @xmath33 cyclically ordered points :    chorddiag.pstex_t    the _ chord diagram of a singular knot _ @xmath34 is the oriented circle @xmath35 with the pre - images of each double point connected by a chord .",
    "let @xmath36 be the vector space spanned by all chord diagrams of order @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the vector space of all @xmath38-valued linear functions on @xmath36 .",
    "a vassiliev invariant @xmath39 determines a function @xmath40 \\in f_n$ ] defined by @xmath40(c)=f(k)$ ] , where k is any singular knot whose chord diagram is d.    the fact that @xmath40 $ ] is well defined ( does not depend on the choice of @xmath41 ) can be seen as follows : if @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two singular knots with the same chord diagram , then they can be projected on the plane in such a way that their knot diagrams coincide except possibly at a finite number of crossings , where @xmath42 may have an over - crossing and @xmath43 an under - crossing or vice versa .",
    "but since @xmath25 is an invariant of order @xmath12 and @xmath41 has @xmath12 double points , a crossing flip does not change the value of @xmath25 ( since the difference would equal to the value of @xmath25 on an @xmath44-singular knot , i.e. 0 ) .",
    "the kernel of the map @xmath45 is , by definition , @xmath46 .",
    "thus , what we have defined is an inclusion @xmath47 .",
    "the image of this inclusion ( i.e. the set of linear maps on chord diagrams that come from vassiliev invariants ) is described by two relations :    * 4 t , the four - term relation * :    4t.pstex_t    for an arbitrary fixed position of @xmath48 chords ( not drawn here ) and the two additional chords as shown .",
    "this follows from the following fact of singular knots :    knot4t.pstex_t    which is easy to show using the following isotopy :    trick.pstex_t    ( or by resolving both double points ) .",
    "* fi , the framing independence relation * ( a.k.a . one - term relation ) :    fi.pstex_t    which follows from the reidemeister one move of knot diagrams .",
    "( the dotted arcs here and on the following pictures mean that there might be further chords attached to the circle , the positions of which are fixed throughout the relation . )    to explain the name of this relation , let us say a word about framed knots .",
    "a _ framing _ on a curve is a smooth choice of a normal vector at each point of the curve , up to isotopy .",
    "this is equivalent to `` thickening '' the curve into a band , where the band would always be orthogonal to the chosen normal vector . a knot projection ( knot diagram )",
    "defines a framing ( `` blackboard framing '' ) , where we always choose the normal vector that is normal to the plane that we project to .",
    "every framing ( up to isotopy ) can be represented as a blackboard framing , for some projection .    if we were to study framed knots ,",
    "these are in one - to - one correspondence to knot diagrams modulo reidemeister moves @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as @xmath51 adds or eliminates a twist , i.e. it changes the framing .",
    "the framing independence relation arises from @xmath51 , meaning that the knot invariants we work with are independent of any framing on the knot .",
    "this will change later in the paper as we turn to graphs .",
    "we define the algebra @xmath24 , as a direct sum of the vector spaces @xmath52 generated by chord diagrams of order @xmath12 considered modulo the fi and 4 t relations .",
    "the multiplication on @xmath24 is defined by the connected sum of chord diagrams , which is well defined thanks to the 4 t relations ( for details , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath53-valued linear functions on @xmath54 are called _ weight systems of order n_. the above construction shows that every vassiliev invariant defines a weight system of the same order .",
    "the famous theorem of kontsevich , also known as the fundamental theorem of finite type invariants , asserts that every weight system arises as the weight system of a finite type invariant .",
    "the proof relies on the construction of a _ universal finite type invariant _ , called the kontsevich integral @xmath0 , which takes its values in the graded completion of @xmath24 .",
    "given a weight system , one gets the appropriate finite type invariant by pre - composing with @xmath0 .",
    "let us represent @xmath1 as a direct product of a complex plane @xmath38 with coordinate @xmath55 and a real line with coordinate @xmath56 .",
    "let the knot @xmath41 be embedded in @xmath57 in such a way that the coordinate @xmath56 is a morse function on @xmath41 .",
    "the _ kontsevich integral _ of @xmath41 is an element in the graded completion of @xmath24 , defined by the following formula :    kintegral.pstex_t    @xmath2    in the formula , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the minimum and maximum of the function @xmath56 on @xmath41 .",
    "the integration domain is the @xmath60-dimensional simplex @xmath61 divided by the critical values into a number of connected components .",
    "the number of summands in the integral is constant in each of the connected components .    in each plane",
    "@xmath62 choose an unordered pair of distinct points @xmath63 and @xmath64 on k , so that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are continuous functions .",
    "@xmath67 denotes the set of such pairs for each @xmath68 .",
    "the integrand is the sum over all choices of @xmath67 .    for a pairing @xmath67",
    ", @xmath69 denotes the number of points @xmath63 or @xmath64 in p where @xmath56 decreases along the orientation of @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath70 denotes the chord diagram obtained by joining each pair of points in @xmath67 by a chord , as the figure shows .    over each connected component ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are smooth functions .",
    "by @xmath73 we mean the pullback of this form to the simplex .",
    "the term of the kontsevich integral corresponding to @xmath74 is , by convention , the only chord diagram with no chords , with coefficient one , i.e , the unit of the algebra @xmath24 .",
    "let us review the proof of the fact that each integral in the above formula is convergent . by looking at the definition",
    ", one observes that the only way the integral may not be finite is the @xmath75 in the denominator getting arbitrarily small near the critical points ( the boundaries of the connected components of the integration domain ) .",
    "this only happens near a cup or cap in the knot- otherwise the minimum distance between strands is a lower bound for the denominator .",
    "if a chord @xmath76 is separated from the critical value by another `` long '' chord @xmath77 ending closer to the critical value , as shown below , then the smallness in the denominator corresponding to chord @xmath76 will be canceled by the smallness of the integration domain for @xmath77 , hence the integral converges :    nonisolated.pstex_t    the integral for the long chord can be estimated as follows ( using the picture s notation ) :    @xmath78    @xmath79    for some constants c and c. so the integral for the long chord is as small as the denominator for the short chord , therefore the integral converges .",
    "thus , the only way a divergence can occur is the case of an isolated chord , i.e. a chord near a critical point that is not separated from it by any other chord ending .",
    "but , by the one term relation , chord diagrams containing an isolated chord are declared to be zero , which makes the divergence of the corresponding integral a non - issue .",
    "since horizontal planes cut the knot into tangles , we will use tangles and their properties to prove the invariance of the kontsevich integral in the class of morse knots .    a _ tangle chord diagram _",
    "is a tangle supplied with a set of _ horizontal _ chords considered up to a diffeomorphism of the tangle that preserves the horizontal fibration .",
    "multiplication of tangles induces a multiplication of tangle chord diagrams .",
    "if @xmath80 is a tangle , the space @xmath81 is a vector space generated by all chord diagrams on @xmath80 , modulo the set of _ tangle one- _ and _ four - term relations _ :    * the tangle one - term relation * ( or framing independence ) : a tangled chord diagram with an isolated chord is equal to zero in @xmath81 .    * the tangle 4 t relation * : let t be a tangle consisting of @xmath12 parallel vertical strands .",
    "denote by @xmath82 the chord diagram with a single horizontal chord connecting the @xmath83-th and @xmath68-th strands , multiplied by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 stands for the number of endpoints of the chord lying on downward - oriented strands .",

    "we take the opportunity here to mention a useful lemma , a slightly different version of which appears in d. bar - natan s paper @xcite , and a special case is stated in murakami and ohtsuki , @xcite .",

    "the kontsevich integral is defined for tangles the same way it is defined for knots .    by fubini s theorem ,",
    "it is multiplicative : @xmath90 whenever the product @xmath91 is defined .",
    "this implies the important fact that the kontsevich integral of the ( vertical , and by the invariance results , any ) connected sum of knots is the product ( in the algebra @xmath24 of chord diagrams ) of the kontsevich integrals of the summands . by the invariance results this will generalize to any connected sum .",
    "we will sometimes refer to this as the factorization property , or multiplicativity .",

    "if @xmath92 and @xmath94 are two tangles that differ only in a thin needle ( possibly twisted ) , as in the figure , such that each level @xmath96 intersects the needle in at most two points and the distance between these is at most @xmath8",

    "so , we can assume that the one closest to the needle s end is a `` long chord '' , suppose the endpoint belonging to the needle is @xmath99 .",
    "then , there s another choice for the @xmath100 chord which touches the needle at the opposite point @xmath101 , as the figure shows , and @xmath70 will be the same for these two choices .",
    "pairedchord.pstex_t    the corresponding two terms appear in @xmath98 with opposite signs due to @xmath102 , and the difference of the integrals can be estimated as follows :    @xmath103    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the value of @xmath56 at the tip of the needle , and c is a constant depending on the minimal distance of the needle to the rest of the knot .",

    "this proves the proposition .",
    "this proves the invariance of the kontsevich integral in the class of morse knots : to move critical points , one can form a sharp needle using horizontal deformations only , then shorten or lengthen the needles arbitrarily , then deform the knot as desired by horizontal deformations .",

    "we will also require edges to be equipped with a framing , i. e. a choice of a normal vector field , which is smooth along the edges and is chosen so that the three normal vectors agree at the vertices .",
    "we can imagine the graph being a `` band graph '' , with thickened edges , as shown in the picture .",

    "@xmath51 is omitted because we re working with framed graphs , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the same as in the knot case . @xmath145 involves moving a strand in front of or behind a vertex :    r4.pstex_t    there are four operations defined on knotted , oriented , framed trivalent graphs :    given a trivalent graph ( knotted or not ) @xmath146 and an edge @xmath147 of @xmath146 , we can _ switch the orientation _ of @xmath147 .",
    "we can also _ delete _ the edge @xmath147 , which means the two vertices at the ends of @xmath147 also cease to exist to preserve the trivalence . to do this",
    ", it is required that the orientations of the two edges connecting to @xmath147 at either end match .",
    "_ unzipping _ the edge @xmath147 ( see the figure below ) means replacing it by two edges that are very close to each other- to do this we use the framing , and thus unzip is only well defined on a knotted framed graph .",
    "the two vertices at the ends of @xmath147 will disappear .",
    "( it can be imagined as cutting the band of @xmath147 in half lengthwise . )",
    "again , the orientations have to match , i.e. the edges at the vertex where @xmath147 begins have to both be incoming , while the edges at the vertex where @xmath147 ends must both be outgoing .",
    "unzip.pstex_t    given two graphs with selected edges @xmath148 and @xmath149 , the _ connected sum _ of these graphs along the two chosen edges is obtained by joining @xmath147 and @xmath25 by a new edge .",

    "connsum.pstex_t      the extended integral will take its values in the algebra @xmath153 , which consists of chord diagrams on the _ skeleton _ @xmath150 , the trivalent graph ( as a combinatorial object , not as embedded in @xmath144 ) , and is again factored out by the same four term relations , along with one more class of relations called the vertex invariance relations :    vi.pstex_t    here , the sign @xmath4 is @xmath5 if the edge the chord is ending on is oriented to be outgoing from the vertex , and @xmath6 if it s incoming .",

    "now let us define operations on the spaces @xmath152 :    given a graph @xmath150 and an edge @xmath147 , the orientation switch operation is a linear map @xmath154 that multiplies a chord diagram @xmath87 by @xmath155 where @xmath107 is the number of chords in @xmath87 ending on @xmath147 .",

    "the extended kontsevich integral , assuming it exists and is an invariant , will commute with the unzip operation .",
    "the problem with the extension is that the integral , as defined above , is divergent . causing this are the chords that are near a vertex ( not separated from a vertex by another chord ) .",
    "these are just like the isolated chords in the knot case , but , contrary to the knot case , we have no reason to factor out by all the chord diagrams containing such chords .    also , if we want to drop the 1 t relation for the sake of working with framed graphs , we have to fix the divergence coming from the isolated chords near critical points as well .",

    "now it s easy to show that all these chords indeed cancel out in @xmath222 : since the left ones all commute with the right ones , the value does nt change if we compute @xmath126 separately on the left and on the right.as the opening of strands is 1 , as well as the renormalization scale , we have @xmath233 on both sides , by lemma [ rescale2 ] .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "( the proof for the mirror image is the same . )            for the statement , we mean that the edges of the answer are oriented according to the orientations of the edges of the picture we re computing @xmath126 of , so the leftmost and rightmost sides are not really equal .",
    "the proof is essentially identical to the previous one .",
    "for the first step of the key observation , we need to slide the right end of the lowest right chord over the bottom part of the picture .",
    "this is done by using one more vi relation .",
    "the resulting sum of two chords commutes with @xmath19 by the locality lemma [ loc ] .",
    "thus we can pull it over @xmath19 and use the vi relation once more to get a single chord again .",
    "a few edge orientations differ from the ones in lemma [ mirror ] .",
    "( we chose orientations there to avoid negative signs , here we re switching to the ones we will use later . ) we can repeat the proof of lemma [ mirror ] with the same edge orientations , then switch the ones we need to switch at the end .",
    "this causes no problems , as @xmath126 commutes with the orientation switch operation . since no chords end on the edges we re reorienting , the result does nt change sign .    a similar lemma , which is a crucial ingredient in the murakami - ohtsuki construction , @xcite , is proved by le , murakami , murakami and ohtsuki in @xcite , the proof involves the computation of the z - value of an associator in terms of values of the multiple zeta function .",
    "note that we are abusing notation again : the way we defined @xmath19 , it was an element of @xmath241 where the strands were horizontal .",
    "due to the symmetry of that picture though , we can slide @xmath19 either up the curve on the left , or up the curve on the right to a vertical position , we will get the same result .",
    "this is what we call @xmath19 in the proposition above .",
    "since @xmath126 commutes with vertical unzip , and in @xmath242 no chords end on the edge we re unzipping , we can deduce that @xmath243 by the factorization property , @xmath244 however , the second factor is @xmath13 ( i.e. has no chords ) by lemma [ rescale2 ] , since the opening of the strands at the top is @xmath13 , and so is the width of the renormalization at the bottom .      also , we can forget about the vertical strand on the right , as we know from lemma [ nointeraction ] ( which generalizes to graphs word by word ) that faraway strands do nt interact .",
    "this proves the first part of the corollary .",
    "the proof or the second part is the same , with all the pictures mirrored .      by the factorization property , @xmath248 again , the second factor is @xmath13 ( no chords at all ) , by lemma [ rescale2 ] , if we assume that the width of the opening where we cut is @xmath13 ( which we are free to do of course , by horizontal deformations ) , and the width we use for the vertex renormalization is also @xmath13 .",
    "the first part of the corollary then follows , as does the second part by mirroring the pictures .",
    "[ translation ] with corrections @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and @xmath215 , such that @xmath18 and @xmath251 , @xmath208 is invariant under moves @xmath13-@xmath211 , and therefore it is an isotopy invariant of knotted trivalent graphs .",
    "note that this @xmath9 and @xmath10 value works only with the orientations of the edges chosen as in the pictures above .",
    "correct notation would be to say that @xmath255 , where in the subscript the first arrow shows the orientation of the top strand of the vertex , the second stands for the lower left , and the last stands for the lower right strand .",
    "it s easy to now come up with a complete set of corrections for all orientations : if we change the orientation of one of the lower strands , we apply the corresponding orientation switch operation to the correction : @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 .",
    "these satisfy equation @xmath15 and @xmath17 , since @xmath126 commutes with the orientation switch operation .",
    "if we switch the orientation of all the edges , the proof remains unchanged ( due to the fact that @xmath259 ) , so we have @xmath260 , and then by the above reasoning , the rest follows : @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263",
    ".        for @xmath12 and @xmath11 the orientation of the strand does nt matter , since these are elements in @xmath206 , so each chord has two endings on the one strand , thus orientation change operation will not change any signs .",
    "we only need to deal with vertical edge delete : since we now have an isotopy invariant , we can first deform the edge to be deleted into a straight vertical line with a @xmath10 vertex on top and @xmath9 vertex on bottom .",
    "thus , it s enough to check that the following equalities are true :        each time @xmath9 appears above , we need to check the equations for all appropriate choices of @xmath9 depending on the orientations of the strands , for example @xmath266 and @xmath267 in the second equation .        where all equalities are understood in @xmath206 .",
    "the first equality is true by definition of @xmath19 and the fact that @xmath126 commutes with orientation switches .",
    "the second is just horizontal deformations and moving critical points , while the third holds because faraway strands do nt interact ( lemma [ nointeraction ] ) .",
    "now the equality follows by taking inverses on both sides .        before we deal with the unzip operation ,",
    "let us produce a one parameter family of corrections that all yield knotted graph invariants well behaved with respect to the orientation switch , edge delete , and connected sum operations .",
    "the reader who is satisfied with one invariant is welcome to skip ahead to the paragraph following remark [ mo ] .        throughout the proof",
    "we will assume that all strand openings are of width @xmath13 as well as @xmath220 , however , the statement itself is just an equality in @xmath273 , and thus independent of the choice of @xmath7 .                                            throughout the above calculations and proofs",
    ", we had always assumed that the renormalization scale @xmath7 was chosen to be @xmath13 . however , when we change the scale , all that happens is that factors of @xmath295 will be placed at @xmath9-vertices and maxima , while the reciprocal is placed at @xmath10-vertices and minima . therefore ,",
    "if the scale is chosen differently , we can account for this by multiplying the correction terms with the inverses of these factors .",
    "commuting with unzip would require that @xmath296 , in other words , after we unzip a vertical edge , we would want the top and the bottom corrections to cancel each other out .",
    "( as we have discussed before , the chords ending on the unzipped edge come in sums of pairs , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 commute with these by the locality lemma [ loc ] , so they could indeed cancel each other out . )          in the argument above , we re ignoring some orientation issues for simplicity .",
    "the edge orientations compatible with unzip are not the same as the ones compatible with edge deletion , so , strictly speaking , we re not talking about the same @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , they only differ by orientation switches , and orientation switches commute with taking inverses , so this does nt interfere with the proof",
    ".    now that we re convinced that this issue is unavoidable , we fix it by renormalizing the unzip operation on @xmath24 , in other words we modify the algebra @xmath24 slightly , changing only the unzip operation .",
    "let @xmath303 , where by @xmath304 we mean `` inject a copy of @xmath19 on the unzipped edge '' .",
    "( this will also commute with the pairs of chords ending on the edge , so it does nt matter where we place it . )    in the case of murakami and ohtsuki s choice of corrections , we have @xmath305 .",
    "the following fact is proved by le and murakami in @xcite : @xmath306 let us sketch a simple proof using properties of @xmath126 and @xmath208 :    by multiplying the tangles used to define @xmath19 and @xmath307 , computing @xmath126 and unzipping a vertical edge with no chords , we get : @xmath308 we can produce this graph by an unzip : @xmath309 but this not being a vertical unzip , it does not commute with @xmath126 , so let us use @xmath208 with our first set of corrections :          since the element on the right side of the equality is central ( by the locality lemma [ loc ] ) , this implies that @xmath19 and @xmath307 commute , and hence @xmath312 .",
    "so the renormalization in this case ( i.e. injecting @xmath313 on the unzipped edge ) has an additional , different description : we achieve the same by first injecting @xmath314 on the edge , then unzipping , and then injecting @xmath315 on both new edges .",
    "taking any member of the one - parameter family of corrections , we can renormalize unzip by planting @xmath316 on the pair of edges resulting from the unzip . this way , in all cases",
    ", @xmath208 becomes an invariant that commutes with all four operations on the knotted trivalent graphs and @xmath24 , with this renormalized version of @xmath11 .",
    "let us end with a sketch of how this construction relates to parenthesized tangles ( a.k.a .",
    "q - tangles ) and drinfeld s associators . there is an easy map @xmath317 from parenthesized tangles to trivalent tangles with one free end on top and one free end on bottom .",
    "we join ends by vertices according to the parenthetization , as shown :        composition of parenthesized tangles translates to joining the bottom end of the first trivalent tangle with the top end of the second , and then unzipping the middle edges until no more unzips are possible . as an example , let s multiply the above tangle by its inverse :      looking at the picture , we can convince ourselves that we get the same result by first applying @xmath317 ( as seen on the previous figure ) , joining the resulting trivalent tangles , and unzipping the middle , or by first multiplying the parenthesized tangles , and then applying @xmath317 ."
