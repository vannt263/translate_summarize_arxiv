    "the highly accurate data for pion production in nucleon  nucleon collisions close to the production threshold are a challenge for theoreticians .",
    "when the first close to threshold data for the total cross section of the reaction @xmath9 appeared in 1990 , existing models fell short by a factor of 510 @xcite .",
    "many different mechanisms were proposed to cure this discrepancy : heavy meson exchanges @xcite , ( off - shell ) pion rescattering @xcite , excitations of baryon resonances @xcite , and pion emission from exchanged mesons @xcite . the total cross sections for the reactions @xmath10 and @xmath2 on the other hand could always be described within a factor of 2  the amplitude is dominated by the isovector rescattering contribution @xcite .",
    "for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to resolve the situation various groups started to investigate @xmath0 using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . as an effective field theory ( eft )",
    "it is to be free of any ambiguities and people expected that now the relevant physics of @xmath0 could be identified . as a big surprise to many , however , it turned out that , when naively using the original power counting by weinberg @xcite , the discrepancy between theory and data became even larger at next  to  leading order ( nlo ) for @xmath11 @xcite as well as for @xmath2 @xcite . at the same time",
    "it was already realized that a modified power counting is nescessary to properly take care of the large momentum transfer characteristic for pion production in @xmath1 collisions , however , when applied in its original formulation the results were basically the same for neutral @xcite as well as charged pions @xcite .",
    "even worse , the corrections at one  loop order ( next  to  next  to  leading order ( n@xmath6lo ) in the standard counting ) turned out to be even larger than the nlo corrections , indicating a divergence of the chiral expansion @xcite .",
    "recently there were two developments : one that focused on some technical aspects related to the evaluation of the matrix elements @xcite and another regarding the power counting for the large momentum transfer reactions .",
    "formal inconsistencies of the naive power counting using the heavy baryon scheme were pointed out in ref .",
    "in addition the ideas formulated in refs . @xcite were further developed and improved  it was especially recognized how to properly estimate loop contributions .",
    "this scheme was implemented in refs . @xcite ",
    "the essential features are described in detail below .",
    "the basic conclusion was that an ordering scheme exists for the reactions @xmath0 that can lead to a convergent series .",
    "however , so far full calculations ( including the distortions due to the @xmath1 interactions ) within this scheme exist only for the production of @xmath12wave pions @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated by explicit evaluation of the leading loop contributions ( shown in figure [ diagram](b)(d ) ) how the presence of the large momentum scale influences loops .",
    "the central findings of that work were that it is possible to define an ordering scheme for @xmath13 , but some loops are to be promoted to significantly lower orders compared to what is expected from weinberg s original counting .",
    "@xcite left two questions unanswered that we will address in this note :    * for the reaction channel @xmath11 the sum of all leading loops canceled ; the origin of this cancellation could not be identified ; * for the channel @xmath2 the sum of diagrams of fig .",
    "[ diagram](b)(d ) gave a finite answer .",
    "however , as pointed out recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding amplitudes grow linearly with increasing final @xmath1relative momentum .",
    "this behavior leads to a large sensitivity to the final @xmath1 wavefunction , once the convolution of those with the transition operators is evaluated as demanded by the non  perturbative nature of the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the solution to this problem proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is to include a new counter term at leading order to absorb this unphysical behavior .",
    "however , chiral symmetry does not allow for such a structure ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "as we will show in this paper , the solution to both questions are related and at the same time shed some light on the concept of reducibility in pion reactions on few  nucleon systems .",
    "we further demonstrate that the net effect of the inclusion of the nlo loops , shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , is to enhance the leading rescattering amplitude by a factor of 4/3 , bringing its contribution to the cross section for @xmath2 close to the experimental value .",
    "already the existence of nuclei shows that perturbation theory is insufficient to properly describe two  nucleon systems : only an infinite sum of diagrams can produce a pole in the @xmath14matrix . to bring this observation in line with power counting",
    ", weinberg proposed to classify all possible diagrams according to the concept of reducibility @xcite : those diagrams that have a two nucleon cut are called reducible .",
    "those which do not are called irreducible .",
    "the latter make up the potential that is to be constructed according to the rules of chpt .",
    "the former are then generated by solving the schrdinger equation , using the mentioned potential as kernel .",
    "this scheme acknowledges that the two nucleon cut contributions are enhanced compared to the irreducible parts .",
    "it was also weinberg who gave a recipe how to calculate processes on few nucleon systems with external probes @xcite : here the transition operators are to be calculated using chpt .",
    "then those transition operators must be convoluted with the appropriate @xmath1 wave functions  in full analogy to the so  called distorted wave born approximation traditionally used in phenomenological calculations  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is necessary to disentangle those diagrams that are part of the wave function from those that are part of the transition operator . in complete analogy to @xmath1 scattering described above ,",
    "the former are called reducible and the latter irreducible .",
    "also here the distinction stems from whether or not the diagram shows a two nucleon cut .",
    "thus , in accordance to this rule , the one loop diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram](b)(d ) are irreducible , whereas diagrams ( a ) seem to be reducible .",
    "however , it will be the central finding of this work that diagrams ( a ) contain a genuine irreducible piece due to the energy dependence of the leading @xmath15vertex , the so  called weinberg ",
    "tomozawa term ( wt ) . specifically , the energy ",
    "dependent part of the wt vertex cancels one of the intermediate nucleon propagators , resulting in the irreducible part of diagrams ( a ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the power counting needs to be modified in order to be applicable for @xmath0 .",
    "the reason for this necessity is the magnitude of the nucleon center - of - mass momentum @xmath16 required to produce a pion at rest in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "it is given by @xmath17 with @xmath18mev and @xmath19mev denoting the nucleon and pion mass , respectively .",
    "( [ pin ] ) exhibits the important feature of the reaction @xmath0 , namely the large momentum mismatch between the initial and the final nucleon - nucleon state .",
    "this leads to a large invariant ( squared ) momentum transfer @xmath20 between in- and outgoing nucleons .",
    "the appearance of the large momentum scale @xmath21 in pion production demands a change in the chiral power counting rules , as pointed out already in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it seems compulsory to include the delta  isobar as an explicit degree of freedom , since the delta - nucleon mass difference @xmath22mev is comparable to the external momentum @xmath23mev .",
    "the hierarchy of scales @xmath24 suggested by this feature is in line with findings within meson exchange models where the delta ",
    "isobar gives significant contributions even close to the threshold @xcite strong support for an important role played by the @xmath25isobar was given by a partial wave analysis  @xcite . ] .",
    "the natural expansion parameter therefore is @xmath26 as a result at leading order only tree level diagrams contribute to the transition operator ( diagram ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ tree ] ) . already at next  to  leading order  in addition to the first diagram that involves a @xmath25isobar ( diagram ( c ) of fig . [ tree ] )  the first loops appear ( see fig . [ diagram ] ) . as a consequence of the two scales @xmath12 and @xmath27 given in eq .",
    "( [ schi ] ) there exists a dimensionless parameter that is of order @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 , that can appear as the argument of non  analytic functions as a result of the evaluation of loop integrals .",
    "thus , each loop now contributes not only to a single order , but to all orders higher than the one where it starts to contribute @xcite . in this work",
    "we only consider the leading parts of the loops in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] that start to contribute at nlo .    at threshold",
    "only two amplitudes are allowed to contribute to the reaction @xmath0 , namely @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where we used the notation @xmath32 to label the total isospin of the initial ( @xmath33 ) and final ( @xmath34 ) @xmath1pair . the third amplitude allowed by the standard selections rules",
    " @xmath35  has to have at least one @xmath12wave in one of the final subsystems .",
    "to the reactions @xmath36 and @xmath37 only @xmath30 and to @xmath38 only @xmath31 contribute at threshold , whereas both @xmath30 and @xmath31 contribute to the reaction @xmath10 .",

    "we need to use @xmath48 where now @xmath49 denotes the deuteron polarization vector and @xmath50 the convolution of the production operator with the deuteron wave function ",
    "although the transition operators for @xmath31 and @xmath50 are the same , the matrix elements in general have different units .",
    "we come back to the evaluation of the deuteron cross section in section [ secresults ] . the amplitude in eq .",

    "analogously , one finds for the total cross section for @xmath2 @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the deuteron mass .",
    "if we neglect all @xmath1 distortions , we get for the leading rescattering contribution ( fig .",
    "[ tree](a ) ) at threshold @xcite @xmath60 where we used that the @xmath61 amplitude to leading order contains not only the standard wt term that scales as the sum of the incoming and outgoing pion energies , here equal to @xmath27 and @xmath62 , respectively , but also its recoil correction equal to @xmath63 .",
    "the relevant terms of the underlying lagrangian density are given in the appendix .",
    "note that with a value of @xmath64 the wt vertex including the recoil correction as it appears in the @xmath0 amplitude takes exactly the value it has for elastic @xmath65 scattering at threshold .",
    "in the reaction @xmath0 the energies of the initial nucleons are of order @xmath66 and the momenta are of order @xmath12 . in irreducible loops , on the other hand ,",
    "both energies and momenta are of order @xmath12 ( see appendix e of ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . as a consequence in the evaluation of diagrams ( b),(c ) , and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] the nucleon recoil terms ( i.e. the nucleon kinetic energies ) can be neglected in the nucleon propagators , since they scale as @xmath27 . at first glance",
    "this seems to be at variance with the recent finding that three body @xmath67 cuts that originate from the nucleon recoils play an essential role in pion reactions on few nucleon systems @xcite .",
    "however , the reactions studied in these references had very different kinematics , as they were small momentum transfer reactions , where in typical kinematics the @xmath68 state was near on  shell . here ,",
    "on the other hand , we are faced with a large momentum transfer reaction : for typical kinematics a @xmath68 intermediate state is far off  shell .",
    "in addition , here there is an additional kinematical suppression for the @xmath68 cuts : at the cut the typical pion momentum , which set the scale for the typical loop momentum , is that of the external pion of order of at most @xmath27 . as a consequence the @xmath68 cuts do not contribute before n@xmath69lo to the reaction @xmath0 @xcite .    by comparison to the full results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that it is allowed to expand the integrand of the loop integrals before evaluation in powers of @xmath70 . as a consequence it was possible to express the leading contribution of all loops corresponding to diagrams ( b)(d ) of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] in terms of a single integral @xmath71 one finds @xmath72 .",
    "the assumption of threshold kinematics ( all outgoing momenta vanish ) simplifies the operator structure significantly and we can write  neglecting for the moment the distortions from the @xmath1 interaction  in order @xcite @xmath73 note , here and in what follows we write equalities although we dropped terms of higher order in @xmath28 . as mentioned in the introduction , the sum of the nlo loops vanishes in case of @xmath30 .",
    "we will give an explanation for this cancellation below .",
    "let us now concentrate on @xmath31 . in order to compare the result of eq .",
    "( [ results ] ) to data , the transition operators need to be convoluted with appropriate @xmath1 wavefunctions .",
    "the convolution integrals that arise necessarily involve non  vanishing @xmath74 , denoting the outgoing @xmath1 relative momenta , even if we still work at threshold",

    "( [ results ] ) . as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , this implies that for large @xmath74 the contributions from the loops grows linearly with @xmath77 . when it then comes to the convolution of those operators with @xmath1 wave function this linear growth of the transition operators leads to a large sensitivity to the deuteron wave functions .",
    "however , there should be no sensitivity to the particular wave functions used , for off  shell quantities are not observable @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the chiral lagrangian does not allow for a counter term to compensate this linear growth  see appendix for details .",
    "the solution given in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the inclusion of a counter term at leading order , is therefore not consistent with the effective field theory used . however , as we will show , the loops with the unwanted behavior will be canceled exactly by an irreducible piece of diagrams ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "we proceed as follows : we first show this cancellation to one loop order without distortions .",

    "the vanishing @xmath80 reproduces the well known result that the wt interaction does not contribute to the leading rescattering diagram in @xmath11 .    in order to proceed we",
    "rewrite the first term in the numerator of the above integral as @xmath81= \\left[\\left(l_0-\\frac{m_\\pi}{2}-\\frac{(\\vec p+\\vec l)^2}{2m}\\right ) + 2m_\\pi\\right ] \\ , \\ ] ] where we used that at threshold @xmath82 .",
    "the first term now exactly cancels the first nucleon propagator and we are left with an expression that no longer has a two nucleon cut  it is irreducible . in this irreducible piece",

    "the remaining pieces in the expressions for @xmath89 exactly agree to the convolution of the leading rescattering contribution with the one pion exchange , however , with the @xmath90 wt vertex put on  shell .",

    "next we show that for all ingredients of the @xmath1 potential but the one  pion exchange the choice of an on  shell @xmath15 vertex is of sufficient accuracy . to this end",
    "we remind the reader that the integral corresponding to the irreducible pieces of this first diagram of figure [ diagram](a ) had a structure like diagram ( b ) of that figure .",
    "this is illustrated in part ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ otherred ] . at leading order in the @xmath1 potential",
    "there is besides the one pion exchange also a contact interaction .",
    "the convolution of the rescattering diagram with the wt vertex ( diagram ( a ) in fig . [ tree ] ) with this part of the @xmath1 potential we can again decompose into a reducible piece with the @xmath61 vertex on  shell and an irreducible piece that takes a structure of an integral with one nucleon less ( see part ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ otherred ] ) ; this diagram , however , does not contribute below n@xmath95lo and is therefore irrelevant to the order we are working .",
    "thus , all that is to be kept is the convolution of the on  shell rescattering contribution with the contact @xmath1 interaction  in line with the findings of ref .  @xcite . at nlo in the @xmath1 potential",
    "there are pion loops .",
    "then the irreducible piece of the convolution of the leading rescattering contribution with this piece results in a two loop diagram ( for a particular example see part ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ otherred ] ) that does not contribute up to n@xmath8lo .",
    "thus , to the order we are working we can safely put the wt vertex on ",
    "shell for the convolution of any piece of the @xmath1 potential with the leading rescattering contribution .",
    "what remains to be shown is that the cancellation of eq .",
    "( [ cancel ] ) survives ( to the given order ) the convolution with the full wave functions .",
    "this generalization is straightforward .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram2 ] for the inclusion of the final state interaction that we want to discuss in detail .",
    "the argument in case of the initial state interaction is completely analogous and will not be given .",
    "note that only the irreducible parts of the diagrams ( a ) are to be included  the reducible pieces get absorbed into the wave functions .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the integration variable of the convolution integral that we chose equal to the four momentum of one of the nucleons .",
    "as argued in the previous paragraph , the integral will be dominated by energies close to the corresponding on  shell energies .",
    "this sets the scale for @xmath96especially we can safely assume @xmath97 .",
    "this is all that is needed to neglect @xmath98 in the nucleon propagator of the pion loop integrals . on the other hand in these loops",
    "@xmath99 only enters as @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the terms that enter in the convolution integrals with the final state interaction to the order we are working are simply given by replacing @xmath16 by @xmath101 in eqs .",
    "( [ results ] ) , ( [ irr1a1 ] ) , and ( [ irr1a2 ] ) .",
    "this will obviously not change the relative strength of the individual diagrams  the cancellation survives the convolution with the wave functions .",
    "we therefore conclude that up to next  to  leading order all irreducible pion loops in the transition operator cancel with the only effect that the wt vertex in the rescattering diagram is to be put on  shell .",
    "since the nlo diagrams discussed in this work contribute only to @xmath31 , we will now discuss their impact on the reaction @xmath2 that is fully determined by that amplitude .",
    "the cross section data for this reaction near threshold is traditionally parameterized as @xmath102 where coulomb effects were neglected . to the reaction @xmath103 both @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    "contribute with only half their strength @xcite . here",
    "@xmath106 denotes the outgoing pion momentum in units of its mass .",
    "the first term gives the @xmath56wave strength , whereas the second one denotes the @xmath12wave contribution ( as well as some possible energy dependencies of the @xmath56wave  @xcite ) .",
    "before comparison with experiment is possible , the transition operators are to be convoluted with appropriate @xmath1 wave functions .",
    "here we use basically the same formalism as described in ref .",
    "@xcite and thus we do not give any formulas in detail .",
    "for the @xmath1 distortions we use the cd  bonn potential @xcite and use the same parameters as in ref .",
    "@xcite . to calculate the leading order ( lo ) rescattering process ( diagram ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ tree ] ) we use the standard expression for the wt term in threshold kinematics  thus we put @xmath107 at the vertex @xcite .",
    "in addition we also evaluate the direct contribution ( diagram ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ tree ] ) .",
    "since we derived the transition operator in threshold kinematics we can only calculate @xmath104 .",
    "we obtain @xmath108 this number is dominated by the rescattering contribution ; switching off the direct term alpha is lowered by 30 % to @xmath109b .",
    "this value is consistent with those given in ref .",
    "note that the direct term is known to be quite model dependent @xcite and is small because of a cancellation of individually sizable terms .",
    "clearly such a cancellation can not be captured by the counting scheme .",
    "still , we point out that in an eft scheme as used here all terms at a given order have to be retained .    as outlined above , in order to include the nlo contributions all we need to do is to replace the @xmath110 in the wt vertex by @xmath111  or , stated differently , to scale the given results for @xmath112 by a factor @xmath113 .",
    "thus , for the rescattering piece we get at nlo @xmath114b , whereas the full result including the direct term is @xmath115 we checked that using different models for the @xmath1 distortions changed the rescattering contribution by about 10 % , in line with previous findings  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ exp ] we compare the results of our calculation to the experimental data @xcite are considerably lower than those for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it appears unclear whether this discrepancy is due to systematic uncertainties ( not shown in the figure ) or due to other sources @xcite . ] .",
    "one clearly sees that going from lo to nlo improves the description of the data .",
    "note also that even a change by about a factor of 2 in the cross section is in line with what is expected from the counting : after all the expansion parameter for the amplitude is @xmath116 .    for a complete nlo calculation what needs to be considered in addition",
    "are diagrams of the kind depicted in fig .",
    "[ tree ] ( c ) , but with the full @xmath117 transition amplitude .",

    "such a fit has not yet been performed and thus we postpone the evaluation of diagram ( c ) to a later work . note , however , that model calculations show that the contribution of the delta  isobar is not more than 10  % in the amplitude @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the proper set of diagrams that contributes to the transition operator for the reaction @xmath0 at nlo in chiral perturbation theory is given by the diagrams of fig .",

    "shell parts of the wt vertex .",
    "this cancellation is required for formal consistency of the whole scheme , since the mentioned diagrams show a linear growth with respect to the outgoing @xmath1 momentum .",
    "such a growth would have led to a large sensitivity to the @xmath1 wave function , when the convolution with the final state interaction is calculated .",
    "this , however , would have been in conflict with general arguments .    this at the same time also explains , why the sum of all loops has to vanish at next  to  leading order for the reaction @xmath11 : in this channel there is no leading rescattering contribution .",
    "thus , there is also nothing that could cancel the linear divergence discussed above .",
    "the consistency of the formalism therefore demands the sum of all loops to vanish .    as a result of our findings",
    "we can conjecture a general recipe on how to deal with pion reactions in a nuclear environment in the presence of time derivatives in vertices : one has to calculate all diagrams up to a given order , including those that are formally reducible .",
    "then the energy dependence in the vertices is used to cancel one of the nucleon propagators .",

    "empirically the isoscalar @xmath65 scattering length is known to be very small .",

    "if , on the other hand , the above rule is used , isoscalar rescattering enters with the strength of the very small isoscalar @xmath65 scattering length and thus would give a negligible contribution .    we have demonstrated that the net effect of the inclusion of the nlo loops , shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , is to enhance the leading rescattering amplitude by a factor of 4/3 , bringing its contribution to the cross section for @xmath2 close to the experimental value .",
