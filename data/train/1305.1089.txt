    "in addition to being natural combinatorial measures , the steiner tree packing problem and the generalized edge - connectivity can be motivated by their interesting interpretation in practice as well as theoretical consideration .    from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "both extremes of this problem are fundamental theorems in combinatorics .",
    "one extreme of the problem is when we have two terminals . in this case internally ( edge-)disjoint trees are just internally ( edge-)disjoint paths between the two terminals , and so the problem becomes the well - known menger theorem .",

    "one can see that the steiner tree packing problem studies local properties of graphs , but the generalized edge - connectivity focuses on global properties of graphs .",
    "the generalized edge - connectivity and the steiner tree packing problem have applications in @xmath37 circuit design , see @xcite . in this application",
