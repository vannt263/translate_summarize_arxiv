    "fountain codes  @xcite form a new family of linear erasure codes with several attractive properties . for a given set of @xmath0 input symbols , a fountain code produces a potentially limitless stream of output symbols ,",
    "each created independently of others as a random combination of input symbols according to a given distribution . ideally , given a randomly selected subset of @xmath4 encoded symbols ,",
    "a decoder should be able to recover the original @xmath0 input symbols with high probability ( w.h.p . ) for some small overhead @xmath5 .",
    "further , fountain codes typically emphasize on efficient encoding and decoding algorithms .    in this work",
    ", we design a new family of fountain codes that combine multiple properties appealing to distributed storage .",
    "one property that is highly desired for distributed storage codes is _ systematic form _ : the original information symbols must appear in the encoded sequence .",
    "their presence enables the reading of source data without decoding and is a practical requirement for most storage applications .",
    "another important property of distributed storage codes is efficient _ repair _",
    "@xcite : when a single encoded symbol is lost it should be possible to reconstruct it without communicating too much information from other encoded symbols .",
    "a related property is that of _ locality _ of each symbol : the number of encoded symbols that need to be accessed to reconstruct that particular symbol  @xcite .",
    "a key observation is that in a systematic linear code , locality is strongly connected to the sparsity of parity symbols  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the maximum number of input symbols combined in a parity symbol .",
    "a parity symbol along with the systematic symbols covered by it form a _",
    "local group_. any symbol in this group can be reconstructed via an appropriate linear combination of the remaining member symbols .",
    "the smaller the size of the local group , the lower the locality of the symbols in it .    in existing fountain codes , such as lt or raptor codes ,",
    "each encoded symbol is a linear combination of @xmath6 or even constant number of input symbols on average .",
    "however , these codes are not systematic and the low degree of the encoded symbols does not imply low locality .",
    "certain classes , such as raptor codes , can be transformed into a systematic form  @xcite via a preprocessing of the input .",
    "unfortunately , due to the additional step , parity symbols are no longer sparse in the original input symbols .",
    "standard fountain codes support computationally efficient encoding and decoding algorithms as a result of a meticulously designed encoded symbol degree distribution .",
    "fast decoding algorithms , however , do not translate to efficient repair : these algorithms aim at retrieving the entire source message from a set of available symbols , and are not tailored to the needs of a single symbol reconstruction . on the contrary , single erasures ",
    "the most frequent scenario in a distributed storage setting  can be efficiently repaired by an erasure code featuring low locality .",
    "if additionally the code is in systematic form , full scale decoding is invoked only in the unlikely event of multiple erasures that can not be locally repaired . in other words ,",
    "the presence of the source data in the encoded sequence in conjunction with low locality renders decoding an infrequently used operation , downgrading the need for efficient decoding algorithms .    the significance of locality is not limited to the repair problem , _ i.e. _ , the reconstruction of a symbol upon its loss .",
    "it extends to the closely related use case of _ degraded reads_. in a distributed setup each symbol is stored on a different storage node , which may be temporarily unavailable due to a variety of reasons . although not permanently lost , a systematic symbol may not be directly accessible , and its local group provides an efficient alternative for reading it . the _ availability _ of a systematic symbol naturally extends the notion of locality , measuring the number of disjoint local groups the symbol belongs to .",
    "we define the _ availability _ of a systematic symbol as the number of disjoint sets of encoded symbols which can be used to reconstruct that particular symbol . in effect",
    ", it characterizes the number of read requests for a particular systematic symbol that can be simultaneously served .    * our contribution : * we introduce a new family of fountain codes that are systematic and also have parity symbols with logarithmic sparsity .",
    "we show that this is impossible if we require the code to be mds , but is possible if we require a near - mds property similar to the probabilistic guarantees provided by lt and raptor codes .",
    "more concretely , for any @xmath7 we construct codes that guarantee that a random subset of @xmath2 symbols suffices to recover the original @xmath0 input symbols w.h.p .",
    "our codes produce an unbounded number of output symbols , creating each parity independently by linearly combining a logarithmic number of randomly chosen input symbols .",
    "we show that this structure also provides logarithmic locality : each symbol in our codes is repairable by accessing only @xmath3 other coded symbols .",
    "we further define the notion of symbol availability and show that the systematic symbols in our codes feature logarithmic availability : with high probability , for each systematic symbol there exist @xmath6 disjoint sets of symbols that can be used to reconstruct it .",
    "this means that multiple parallel jobs can read this symbol concurrently , each by accessing one disjoint set .",
    "this new property is motivated by the straggler performance bottlenecks observed recently in distributed storage systems  @xcite",
    ".    one disadvantage of our construction is higher decoding complexity .",
    "our codes can be decoded by solving a system of linear equations over @xmath8 , which corresponds to maximum likelihood decoding for the erasure channel .",
    "this naive decoding can be implemented using gaussian elimination and requires @xmath9 steps .",
    "fortunately , the matrices we construct are sparse , allowing faster decoding : wiedemann s algorithm  @xcite can be used to decode in @xmath10 time .",
    "standard fountain codes create linear equations that can be solved just by back - substitution which amounts to decoding complexities of @xmath11 for lt  @xcite and @xmath12 for raptor  @xcite but offer no locality .",
    "it remains open to construct fountain codes that have locality and near - linear decoding complexity .",
    "our main technical contribution is a novel random matrix result : we show that a family of random matrices with non independent entries have full rank with high probability .",
    "the analysis builds on the connections of matrix determinants to flows on random bipartite graphs , using techniques from @xcite .",
    "our key result is showing that a new family of sparse random graphs have matchings w.h.p .",
    "our random graph contribution is explained in section [ sec : graph - perspective ] .",
    "given @xmath0 input symbols , elements of a finite field @xmath8 , we want to encode them into @xmath13 symbols using a linear code .",
    "linear codes are described by a @xmath14 _ generator _",
    "matrix @xmath15 over @xmath8 , which when multiplied by an input vector @xmath16 produces a codeword @xmath17 .",
    "ideally , we would like @xmath15 to have the following properties :    * _ systematic form _ , _",

    "_ rateless property _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , each column is created independently .",
    "the number @xmath13 of columns does not have to be specified for the encoder a priori .",
    "equivalently , encoded symbols can be created or removed dynamically upon request , without recreating the entire encoded sequence . *",
    "_ mds property _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , any @xmath0 columns of @xmath15 have rank @xmath0 , implying that any subset of @xmath0 encoded symbols suffices to retrieve the input . * _ low locality_. @xmath15 has _ locality _",
    "@xmath19 if each column can be written as a linear combination of at most @xmath19 other columns .",
    "if the code is systematic , then sparse parities suffice to obtain good locality @xcite . *",
    "_ high availability_. a systematic symbol has _",
    "@xmath20 if it can be written as a linear combination of @xmath20 disjoint sets of symbols , of cardinality @xmath19 .",
    "the code has availability @xmath21 , equal to that of the least available systematic symbol .    for any code , any sufficiently large subset of encoded symbols should allow recovery of the original data .",
    "the size of such a set is tightly related to the reliability of the code . for optimal reliability , _ i.e. _ , in the case of mds codes , an information theoretically minimum subset of @xmath0 encoded symbols suffices to decode . when equipped with systematic form",
    ", the generator matrix of an mds code affords no zero coefficient in the parity generating columns . to verify that , consider a parity column with a zero coefficient in the @xmath22-th position : that parity column along with any @xmath23 systematic columns excluding the one corresponding to the @xmath22-th systematic symbol form a singular matrix .",
    "if parities are deliberately sparse in the input symbols , seeking to improve the code s _ locality _ , the property that any @xmath0 encoded symbols suffice to retrieve the original data has to be relaxed . in this work",
    ", we require that for @xmath1 , a set of @xmath24 randomly selected encoded symbols suffice to decode with high probability ; the decoder may fail , but with a probability vanishing polynomially in @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to a code with this property as _ near - mds_.    under this constraint , we seek codes that achieve optimal locality , which translates into determining how sparse the parities can be without violating the decoding guarantee",
    ". we will show that it is impossible to recover the original message with high probability if the parities are linear combinations of fewer than @xmath25 input symbols .",
    "furthermore , we will design codes that achieve logarithmic sparsity in the parities and hence , order optimal locality .",
    "we conclude the paper investigating the availability of our construction , showing that with high probability every systematic symbol belongs to a logarithmic number of disjoint local groups .",
    "in lt codes , the first practical realizations of fountain codes invented by luby @xcite , the average degree of the output symbols , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of input symbols combined into an output symbol , is @xmath26 .",
    "note , however , that sparsity in this case does not imply good locality , since lt codes lack systematic form .",
    "building on lt , shokrollahi in @xcite introduced raptor codes , a different class of fountain codes .",
    "the core idea is to precode the input symbols prior to the application of an appropriate lt code . by virtue of the two layer encoding ,",
    "the per symbol encoding cost  which corresponds to average degree of encoded symbols  is reduced to a constant , while the @xmath0 input symbols can be retrieved in linear time by a set of @xmath2 encoded symbols , with probability of failure at most inversely polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "however , the original raptor design does not feature the highly desirable systematic form .",
    "further , similar to the lt codes , the constant average degree of the encoded symbols does not imply good locality .",
    "in the same work  @xcite , shokrollahi provided a construction that yields a systematic flavor of raptor codes .",
    "the raptor encoding is not applied directly on the input symbols , rather on the output of a preprocessing step of complexity @xmath27 .",
    "the source symbols appear in the encoded stream , but due to the preprocessing step the parity symbols are no longer sparse in the original input symbols , despite their constant average degree .",
    "gummadi in his thesis @xcite was the first to consider the design of fountain codes explicitly oriented for storage applications , _",
    "i.e. _ , codes that feature systematic form and efficient repair .",
    "the latter is quantified by _",
    "repair complexity _ : the average number of symbol operations performed to repair a set of erased symbols .",
    "gummadi proposes systematic variants of lt and raptor codes that feature low ( even constant ) expected repair complexity .",
    "however , the overhead @xmath5 required for decoding is suboptimal : it can not be made arbitrarily small .",
    "our main result is the analysis of the rank of a new family of sparse random matrices over @xmath8 . in particular , we investigate the probability that a @xmath28 matrix comprising any number @xmath29 of systematic columns and @xmath30 random @xmath3-sparse columns has full rank .",
    "there is a long line of work on the distribution of the rank of sparse random matrices over a finite field ( _ e.g. _ , work by karp  @xcite , kovalenko  @xcite , balakin  @xcite , cooper  @xcite and references therein ) . that line of work , however , typically focuses on random matrices whose entries are independently distributed . in our case ,",
    "systematic columns carry exactly one nonzero entry , while the number of nonzero entries in the remaining columns is strictly upper bounded , rendering column entries dependent .",
    "we introduce a new family of fountain codes that are systematic and also have sparse parities .",
    "each parity symbol is a random linear combination of up to @xmath31 randomly chosen input symbols . due to their randomized nature ,",
    "our codes provide a probabilistic guarantee on successful decoding .",
    "in particular , we require that a set of @xmath32 randomly selected encoded symbols , for arbitrarily small @xmath7 can be decoded successfully with high probability , _",
    "i.e. _ , with probability of failure vanishing like @xmath33 . we show that under this constraint , @xmath31 must be of at least logarithmic order in @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 . surprisingly , however , a logarithmic sparsity level for the parity symbols is also achievable , hence @xmath35 .",
    "the sparsity of the parity columns corresponds to the _ locality _ of the code family .",
    "our main result , which is asymptotic in @xmath0 , is established in theorem [ thm : main - theorem ] , at the end of this section .",
    "we conclude the section with a study of the _ availability _ of our construction .    given a vector @xmath36 of @xmath0 input symbols in @xmath8 , the code is a linear mapping of @xmath36 to a vector @xmath37 of higher dimension @xmath13 through a @xmath14 matrix @xmath15 .",
