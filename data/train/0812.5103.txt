    "the idea of correspondence between black holes and massive string states suggested by susskind @xcite was elaborated in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "though naively the degeneracy of the string massive levels seems to contradict the bekenstein - hawking area formula , it turns out that there is an agreement between the geometric and the statistical entropies for the critical mass at which the size of the string configuration approaches the gravitational radius of the black hole @xcite . some arguments in favor of the black hole ",
    "string transition were given in @xcite considering classical and string pictures of the wave scattering .",
    "here we would like to push further another argument based on the analysis of the moduli space of the curvature corrected extremal charged dilatonic black holes @xcite .",
    "extremal dilatonic black holes are especially suitable to probe the conjectured string  black hole transition for the following reason . to minimize uncertainties",
    "related to higher order quantum corrections it is common to consider the bps states usually associated with black holes exhibiting a degenerate event horizon . at the level of the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory",
    "such black holes are problematic since their horizon radius tends to zero implying vanishing bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "meanwhile , from the string theory side , the entropy is expected to be non - zero .",
    "recently understanding of this situation was improved by realizing that curvature corrections @xcite to the einstein action lead to stretching the horizon to a finite radius @xcite , so that the geometric entropy calculations fit to microscopic predictions @xcite ( both results being different from the naive bekenstein - hawking value ) .    however",
    ", another problem was noticed in @xcite : although the entropies had been claimed to agree , the classical calculations were based on the purely local considerations , like sen entropy function approach @xcite , which require solving the einstein equations only in the vicinity of the event horizon .",
    "meanwhile , to be sure that one deals with the black hole indeed , global integration of the einstein equations is necessary which should provide an extension of the local solutions to infinity .",
    "an attempt of such a continuation in the einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet theory with an arbitrary dilaton coupling @xcite revealed existence of the threshold behavior : global solutions cease to exist for the dilaton coupling above some critical value .",
    "this was interpreted as an indication for the black hole ",
    "string transition anticipated in @xcite .    here",
    "we would like to push this reasoning further and to mention its possible relevance to the problem of the final stage of hawking evaporation .",
    "note that the gauss - bonnet term is the most popular candidate to imitate string corrections to the einstein action @xcite .",
    "the four - dimensional newton constant @xmath1 , the string inverse tension @xmath2 , and the string coupling @xmath0 are related in four dimensions as @xmath3 .",
    "thus , decreasing string coupling @xmath4 implies decreasing @xmath1 . since the coefficient in front of the gauss - bonnet term is dimensionless , the decreasing @xmath1 , entering the denominator of the einstein term , makes this term to dominate the gauss - bonnet term . technically , however , it is more convenient to introduce a variable gauss - bonnet coupling parameter @xmath5 and to consider decreasing @xmath5 for fixed @xmath1 . from the point of view of the black hole ",
    "string correspondence principle @xcite the black hole case corresponds to large @xmath6 , hence , in our treatment , to large @xmath5 ( more precisely , to large dilaton - renormalized @xmath5 which we will call later @xmath7 ) .",
    "the existence of the lower bound for @xmath7 in the black hole solution space then can be interpreted as a signal of the black hole  string transition .",
    "black hole solutions to the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory with the gauss bonnet term introduced in the einstein frame were constructed in @xcite .",
    "they qualitatively confirm the above expectations .",
    "however , from the string theory point of view , the gauss - bonnet term has to be introduced in the string frame .",
    "transformation of the einstein - frame version of the gauss - bonnet gravity to the string frame leads to a lagrangian which differs from the string - frame version of the gauss - bonnet gravity by the forth - order dilaton derivative term . therefore these two theories are not equivalent . here",
    "we investigate the extremal black holes in the second version , adding the gauss - bonnet term in the string frame .",
    "another new feature of the present work is the use of the s - duality symmetric dilaton function which is also motivated by string theory .",
    "it is worth noting that , within the einstein - maxwell - dilaton model without curvature corrections , electric and magnetic extremal black holes look very different in the string frame . for magnetic black holes",
    "the dilaton conformal factor cancels the divergent metric term on the horizon , so in the string frame the solutions look regular . for electric ones",
    "the singularity persists in the string frame too .",
    "so the role of curvature corrections is expected to be more significant for the electric solutions .",
    "actual calculations show that purely electric extremal black holes do not exist within the string frame version of the einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet theory : some magnetic charge is necessary",
    ". however one can distinguish the electrically and the magnetically dominated dyons .",
    "our interpretation of the boundary in the parameter space as a signal of the black hole ",
    "string transition refers to the case of electric dominance .",
    "we start with the following four - dimensional action : @xmath8 where @xmath9 the dilaton factor @xmath10 in front of the gauss - bonnet term inheriting the s - duality symmetry of the heterotic string @xcite can be presented as @xmath11 where the dedekind @xmath12function is defined on the complex plane of @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14 it is a modular form of the weight 1/2 satisfying the functional equations @xmath15 which represent the action of generators of the modular group . in the general case @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the axion field . here",
    "we consider only static spherically symmetric configurations for which it is consistent to set the axion @xmath18 . in this truncated theory",
    "the function @xmath10 is invariant under the discrete @xmath19-duality @xmath20 .",
    "note that asymptotically for large @xmath19 it is a linear function of the dilaton : @xmath21 .",
    "consider the following parametrization of the static spherically symmetric space - time : @xmath22 and the ansatz for the gauge field : @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting magnetic charge . substituting this ansatz into the action we obtain the following one - dimensional lagrangian @xmath25 +    s'\\left(\\sigma w \\rho\\rho'+\\frac{\\sigma    w'\\rho^2}{4}+\\frac{\\sigma'w\\rho^2}{2}\\right)&&{\\nonumber}\\\\-    \\frac{\\alpha\\psi'}{\\sigma}(w\\sigma^2)'(w\\rho'^2 - 1)+    sw\\sigma\\rho^2\\frac{s'^2}{4s^2}+    s{\\left(}\\frac{\\rho^2f'^2}{2\\sigma}-\\frac{\\sigma    m^2}{2\\rho^2}{\\right)},&&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding euler - lagrange equations are rather complicated except that for the vector field which can be integrated once to give @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an electric charge parameter defined on the horizon ( an asymptotical definition of the electric charge differs from this by the dilaton exponent ) .",
    "therefore , after fixing the gauge @xmath29 , the problem is reduced to three second - order ordinary differential equations for three unknown functions @xmath30 and a constraint equation .",
    "one can investigate the residual symmetries of the lagrangian .",
    "consider first the dilaton shift ( rescaling of @xmath19 ) : the emd part is invariant under the following transformation with the global parameter @xmath31 : @xmath32 the invariance of the gb term depends on the behavior of the function @xmath10 .",
    "another symmetry comes from the rescaling of the electric charge ( with the global parameter @xmath33 ) which causes the following symmetry of the full lagrangian : @xmath34 these symmetries will be used to clarify nature of parameters of the numerical solutions obtained below .",
    "to construct the extremal black hole solution ( by extremality we mean the @xmath35 structure of the event horizon ) we first construct the local series solution in the vicinity of the event horizon @xmath36 .",
    "we use the gauge @xmath29 .",
    "the desired solution must satisfy the conditions : @xmath37 thus the expansions must be on the form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 . recall that @xmath40 is a function of the dilaton field @xmath19 .",
    "therefore all @xmath41 are the functions of @xmath42 , explicitly one has @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the @xmath45th derivatives of @xmath40 depending only on @xmath46 . substituting these expansions into the equations of motion one",
    "obtains the sequence of constraints on the coefficients . in the leading order",
    "we get the relations between @xmath47 . since we wish to determine the range of @xmath5 for which the black hole solutions exist , we consider @xmath5 as a variable parameter on equal footing with the electric and magnetic charges .",
    "it is convenient to present the magnetic charge as @xmath48 with @xmath49 defined on the semi - axis @xmath50 , the remaining parameters will look simpler in terms of @xmath49 . to avoid using an explicit dependence @xmath51 one can also leave @xmath46 as a parameter and express the expansion coefficients as functions of @xmath52 , three of which @xmath28 , @xmath49 and @xmath46 are independent .    in the leading order",
    "we find the following relations : @xmath53 this corresponds to the bertotti - robinson metric @xmath35 on the horizon with the curvature radius of the anti - de sitter sector coinciding with the radius of the two - sphere : @xmath54 since @xmath55 .",
    "with account for the second expansion terms we have : @xmath56 one can notice that the electric charge @xmath28 is just a scale factor for the radial metric function and the gauge field : the transformation ( [ eq : sym2 ] ) with @xmath57 will remove this parameter from the expansions .",
    "we can use this property to achieve a correct asymptotic form of the solution at spatial infinity .",
    "we are interested in asymptotically flat metrics such that @xmath58 we demand the metric to be asymptotically flat in the einstein frame as well , what implies that the dilaton must be finite at infinity .",
    "consider a solution with the constant asymptotic value @xmath59 of the metric component @xmath60 at infinity . from the equations of motion one",
    "has @xmath61 , therefore an asymptotic behavior of @xmath62 is determined by @xmath59 . from the relations ( [ eq : sym2 ] ) it is clear that in order to pass to the solution with another asymptotic value @xmath63 one should replace @xmath28 with @xmath64 .",
    "the dilatonic derivative coefficient @xmath65 enters the expansions only in some combination with @xmath66 , thus being the scale factor as well .",
    "it can be removed by the transformation @xmath67 .    in the case of the linear function @xmath68 one",
    "has @xmath69 and all other @xmath70 vanish .",
    "then the parameter @xmath71 is a scale factor too .",
    "indeed , now the transformation ( [ eq : sym1 ] ) acts on the gb term in the same way as on the emd term if we rescale @xmath72 , leading to the symmetry of the full lagrangian under the dilaton shift .",
    "note that the conditions ( [ eq : series2 ] ) at spatial infinity are not invariant under the dilaton shift , and the minkowskian asymptotic behavior can be reached only for a unique value of @xmath71 if the other parameters are fixed . also , for a purely electric configuration ( @xmath73 ) all the parameters will act as scale factors .",
    "this is the reason why we are motivated to investigate more general dyonic systems .",
    "the solutions with @xmath74 are possible only for vanishing @xmath5 .",
    "this is exactly the condition on the charges @xmath75 for which the extremal limit of the emd black hole exists @xcite .",
    "it has the @xmath35 horizon and the minkowski asymptotic behavior . in the _ string _ frame",
    "the solution takes the form @xmath76 ,    \\quad \\gamma=\\frac{{s_\\infty}{p_0}}{\\sqrt{2}g({s_\\infty}-{p_0})},\\quad \\delta=\\frac{{p_0}}{{s_\\infty}-{p_0 } } , { \\nonumber}\\\\    s & = & { s_\\infty}\\rho',{\\qquad}w\\rho'^2=\\left(1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{{p_0}\\rho}\\right)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath77 is the asymptotic value of the dilaton at spatial infinity , and @xmath78 denotes the real branch of the lambert @xmath79-function which satisfies the following functional and differential equations : @xmath80    let us discuss the s - duality symmetry of the back hole solutions we are looking for .",
    "the action of the s - duality transformations on the charges and the dilatonic background on the horizon in the general case of our model with an axion present is @xcite : @xmath81 if we set zero the horizon value of the axion @xmath82 , we will get the constraints on the parameters of the transformation @xmath83 .",
    "there are two possibilities : @xmath84 the first transformation is a kind of rescaling ( [ eq : sym1],[eq : sym2 ] ) with @xmath85 .",
    "the second transformation is the discrete s - duality : it interchanges the electric and magnetic charges and inverts the dilaton .",
    "now consider the unique value of the parameter @xmath74 , for which the horizon expansions are compatible with switching off the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "the s - duality transformation acts on @xmath49 as follows : @xmath86 if @xmath74 , then @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "therefore the surface @xmath89 in the parameter space maps into itself under the s - duality .",
    "our goal is to find the region of parameters for which asymptotically flat extremal black holes do exist . from numerical calculations",
    "it follows that this is only possible in some region of the parameters @xmath90 bounded from below .",
    "note that the transformation to the einstein frame reads : @xmath91 so the solution corresponding to the parameter @xmath92 asymptotically will satisfy the relations @xmath93 which correspond to the minkowski space in the einstein frame .",
    "it turns out that the local solutions defined by the series expansions on the horizon can be extended to spatial infinity not for all values of the parameters .",
    "as we have discussed , the family of solutions we are interested in is characterized by two free parameters , if one considers the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath5 as a parameter . since in our treatment",
    "the dilaton @xmath19 generically is not equal to one at infinity , it is more appropriate to use a dilaton - renormalized gb coupling constant @xmath94 instead of @xmath5 . as the second parameter we use the quantity @xmath49 replacing the magnetic charge .",
    "we explored the regions in the parameter plane of @xmath95 for which regular solutions exist both for the linear and for the self - dual forms of the function @xmath10 .",
    "numerical calculations reveal that for the linear dilaton function @xmath68 there are no regular black hole solutions at all .",
    "but for the s - duality symmetric function @xmath10 given by ( [ eq : psi ] ) such solutions _ do exist _ in the region @xmath96 for @xmath97 , and in the region @xmath98 for @xmath99 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : planef ] . passing from @xmath49 to the electric and magnetic charges one finds that the first region corresponds to the electrically dominated configurations for which @xmath100 , while the second  to the magnetically dominated ones",
    "therefore the electrically dominated black holes with @xmath35 horizons exist when the ( dilaton renormalized ) gb coupling @xmath7 exceeds some minimal value , while the magnetically dominated black holes exist for @xmath7 bounded from above . in",
    "what follows we will concentrate on the first case as potentially relevant to our discussion .",
    "the adm mass and the dilaton charge can be extracted from the expansions at spatial infinity in the einstein frame : @xmath101 it turns out that in the limit @xmath102 the mass @xmath103 remains finite while the dilaton charge @xmath104 and the asymptotic value of the dilaton @xmath105 diverge .",
    "two other physical parameters appropriate to global solutions are the electric and magnetic charges @xmath106 and @xmath107 defined asymptotically by integration of the corresponding fluxes over the large sphere : @xmath108 they differ from the charges defined on the horizon by the asymptotic value of the dilaton . in the limit",
    "@xmath102 the electric charge @xmath106 tends to a constant while the magnetic charge @xmath107 diverges .",
    "near the boundaries of the allowed region of @xmath7 , namely for @xmath109 and @xmath102 , one observes a peculiar relation between the asymptotic charges and the adm mass .",
    "recall , that in the emd theory without curvature corrections the bps limit corresponds to the following condition @xcite : @xmath110 when @xmath102 ( large curvature corrections ) , the dilaton charge @xmath104 and the magnetic charge @xmath107 diverge while the mass @xmath103 and the electric charge remain @xmath106 constant . in the case of small curvature corrections ,",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath107 are small with respect to @xmath103 and @xmath106 . to describe the results of numerical calculations we introduce the ratio @xmath112 and explore its variation with growing @xmath7 from @xmath113 to infinity .",
    "the results for two fixed values of the magnetic parameter @xmath114 and @xmath115 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bps ] .",
    "it turns out that in both limits @xmath116 and @xmath102 the bps condition ( [ eq : bps1 ] ) of the supergravity without curvature corrections is fulfilled .",
    "thus the family of curvature corrected black hole solutions is bounded by two quasi - bps states .",
    "the lower limit is the charged black hole with the mass @xmath103 and the absolute value of the electric charge @xmath117 of the same order and significantly larger than the dilaton charge @xmath111 and the magnetic charge @xmath118 .",
    "the upper limit is the black hole with extremely strong magnetic and dilaton fields . with @xmath49 approaching @xmath119 ,",
    "the plot shrinks to the abscissa .",
    "the limit @xmath74 corresponds to the single bps solution when the range of @xmath7 shrinks to the point @xmath120 .",

    "let us briefly summarize the results obtained . our aim was to investigate the domain of an effective curvature coupling parameter @xmath7 for which the system admits the extremal black hole solutions with the horizon geometry @xmath35 .",

    "satisfy the same bps condition , as singular extremal black holes in the theory without curvature corrections .",
    "this feature is similar to that observed previously in the einstein - frame gauss - bonnet gravity  @xcite .",

    "this is what is expected for the transition region .",
    "one can also argue that in the process of evaporation the mass of the black hole decreases and at some moment the parameters of the solution leave the allowed domain , so one enters into the transition region",
