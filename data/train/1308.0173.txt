    "due to the increasing use of wireless technology in communication networks , there has been a significant amount of research on methods of improving wireless performance .",
    "while there are many ways of measuring wireless performance , a good first step ( which has been extensively studied ) is the notion of _ capacity_. given a collection of communication links , the capacity of a network is simply the maximum number of simultaneously satisfiable links .",
    "this can obviously depend on the exact model of wireless communication that we are using , but is clearly an upper bound on the  usefulness \" of the network .",
    "there has been a large amount of research on analyzing the capacity of wireless networks ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and it has become a standard way of measuring the quality of a network . because of this , when introducing a new technology it is interesting to analyze its affect on the capacity .",
    "for example , we know that in certain cases giving transmitters the ability to control their transmission power can increase the capacity by @xmath4 or @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the ratio of the longest link length to the smallest transmitter - receiver distance , and can clearly never decrease the capacity . however , while the capacity might improve , it is not nearly as clear that the _ achieved _ capacity will improve . after all , we do not expect our network to actually have performance that achieves the maximum possible capacity .",
    "we show that not only might these improved technologies not help , they might in fact _ decrease _ the achieved network capacity . following andrews and dinitz  @xcite and sgeirsson and mitra  @xcite , we model each link as a self - interested agent and analyze various types of game - theoretic behavior ( nash equilibria and no - regret behavior in particular ) .",
    "we show that a version of _ braess s paradox _",
    "@xcite holds : adding new technology to the networks ( such as the ability to control powers ) can actually decrease the average capacity at equilibrium .",
    "our main results show that in the context of wireless networks , and particularly in the context of the sinr model , there is a version of _ braess s paradox _  @xcite . in his seminal paper ,",
    "braess studied congestion in road networks and showed that adding additional roads to an existing network can actually make congestion _",
    "worse _ , since agents will behave selfishly and the additional options can result in worse equilibria .",
    "this is completely analogous to our setting , since in road networks adding extra roads can not hurt the network in terms of the value of the optimum solution , but can hurt the network since the _ achieved _ congestion gets worse . in this work",
    "we consider the physical model ( also called the sinr model ) , pioneered by moscibroda and wattenhofer  @xcite and described more formally in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "intuitively , this model works as follows : every sender chooses a transmission power ( which may be pre - determined , e.g.  due to hardware limitations ) , and the received power decreased polynomially with the distance from the sender . a transmission is successful if the received power from the sender is large enough to overcome the interference caused by other senders plus the background noise .    with our baseline being the sinr model ,",
    "we then consider four ways of  improving \" a network : adding power control , adding interference cancellation , adding both power control and interference cancellation , and decreasing the sinr threshold . with all of these modifications",
    "it is easy to see that the optimal capacity can only increase , but we will show that the equilibria can become worse . thus  improving \" a network might actually result in worse performance .    the game - theoretic setup that we use",
    "is based on  @xcite and will be formally described in section  [ sec : game - theory ] , but we will give an overview here .",
    "we start with a game in which the players are the links , and the strategies depend slightly on the model but are essentially possible power settings at which to transmit .",
    "the utilities depend on whether or not the link was successful , and whether or not it even attempted to transmit . in a pure nash equilibrium every player has a strategy ( i.e.  power setting ) and has no incentive to deviate : any other strategy would result in smaller utility . in a mixed nash equilibrium",
    "every link has a probability distribution over the strategies , and no link has any incentive to deviate from their distribution .",
    "finally , no - regret behavior is the empirical distribution of play when all players use _ no - regret _ algorithms , which are a widely used and studied class of learning algorithms ( see section  [ sec : game - theory ] for a formal definition ) .",
    "it is reasonably easy to see that any pure nash is a mixed nash , and any mixed nash is a no - regret behavior .",
    "for all of these , the quality of the solution is the achieved capacity , i.e.  the average number of successful links .",
    "our first result is for interference cancellation ( ic ) , which has been widely proposed as a practical method of increasing network performance  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of interference cancellation is quite simple .",
    "first , the strongest interfering signal is detected and decoded .",
    "once decoded , this signal can then be subtracted (  canceled \" ) from the original signal .",
    "subsequently , the next strongest interfering signal can be detected and decoded from the now  cleaner \" signal , and so on .",
    "as long as the strongest remaining signal can be decoded in the presence of the weaker signals , this process continues until we are left with the desired transmitted signal , which can now be decoded .",
    "this clearly can increase the capacity of the network , and even in the worst case can not decrease it . and yet due to bad game - theoretic interactions",
    "it might make the achieved capacity worse :    [ thm : ic - intro ] there exists a set of links in which the _ best _ no - regret behavior under interference cancellation achieves capacity at most @xmath8 times the _ worst _ no - regret behavior without interference cancellation , for some constant @xmath9 .",
    "however , for every set of links the worst no - regret behavior under interference cancellation achieves capacity that is at least a constant fraction of the best no - regret behavior without interference cancellation .",
    "thus ic can make the achieved capacity worse , but only by a constant factor .",
    "note that since every nash equilibrium ( mixed or pure ) is also no - regret , this implies the equivalent statements for those type of equilibria as well . in this result ( as in most of our examples ) we only show a small network ( @xmath10 links ) with no background noise , but these are both only for simplicity  it is easy to incorporate constant noise , and the small network can be repeated at sufficient distance to get examples with an arbitrarily large number of links .",
    "we next consider power control ( pc ) , where senders can choose not just whether to transmit , but at what power to transmit .",
    "it turns out that any equilibrium without power control is also an equilibrium with power control , and thus we can not hope to find an example where the best equilibrium with power control is worse than the worst equilibrium without power control ( as we did with ic ) .",
    "instead , we show that adding power control can create worse equilibria :    [ thm : pc - intro ] there exists a set of links in which there is a pure nash equilibrium with power control of value at most @xmath8 times the value of the worst no - regret behavior without power control , for some constant @xmath9 .",
    "however , for every set of links the worst no - regret behavior with power control has value that is at least a constant fraction of the value of the _ best _ no - regret behavior without power control .",
    "note that the first part of the theorem implies that not only is there a pure nash with low - value ( with power control ) , there are also mixed nash and no - regret behaviors with low value ( since any pure nash is also mixed and no - regret ) .",
    "similarly , the second part of the theorem gives a bound on the gap between the worst and the best mixed nashes , and the worst and the best pure nashes .",
    "our third set of results is on the combination of power control and interference cancellation .",
    "it turns out that the combination of the two can be quite harmful .",
    "when compared to either the vanilla setting ( no interference cancellation or power control ) or the presence of power control without interference cancellation , the combination of ic and pc acts essentially as in theorem  [ thm : pc - intro ] : pure nash equilibria are created that are worse than the previous worst no - regret behavior , but this can only be by a constant factor .",
    "on the other hand , this factor can be super - constant when compared to equilibria that only use interference cancellation .",
    "let @xmath1 be the ratio of the length of the longest link to the minimum distance between any sender and any receiver .",
    "there exists a set of links in which the worst pure nash with both pc and ic ( and thus the worst mixed nash or no - regret behavior ) has value at most @xmath11 times the value of the worst no - regret behavior with just ic .",
    "however , for every set of links the worst no - regret behavior with both pc and ic has value at least @xmath12 times the value of the best no - regret behavior with just ic .",
    "this theorem means that interference cancellation  changes the game \" : if interference control were not an option then power control can only hurt the equilibria by a constant amount ( from theorem  [ thm : pc - intro ] ) , but if we assume that interference cancellation is present then adding power control can hurt us by @xmath4",
    ". thus when deciding whether to use both power control and interference cancellation , one must be particularly careful to analyze how they act in combination .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of decreasing the sinr threshold @xmath3 ( this value will be formally described in section  [ sec : models ] ) . we show that , as with ic , there are networks in which a decrease in the sinr threshold can lead to _ every _ equilibrium being worse than even the worst equilibrium at the higher threshold , despite the capacity increasing or staying the same :    there exists a set of links and constants @xmath13 in which the best no - regret behavior under threshold @xmath14 has value at most @xmath8 times the value of the worst no - regret behavior under threshold @xmath3 , for some constant @xmath9 . however , for any set of links and any @xmath13 the value of the worst no - regret behavior under @xmath14 is at least a constant fraction of the value of the best no - regret behavior under @xmath3 .",
