    "quantum information processing holds the promise of solving efficiently a variety of computational tasks that are intractable on a classical computer  @xcite .",
    "such tasks are routinely decomposed into a series of single - qubit rotations and two - qubit entangling gates  @xcite . while the implementation of accurate single - qubit gates has been achieved in a variety of platforms  @xcite , two - qubit entangling gates with similar accuracies are still very demanding .",
    "such accuracies are compromised by the fact that _ ( i ) _ the qubits used to encode the information are not perfectly isolated from the environment , _",
    "( ii ) _ the quantum data bus used to mediate the entangling gates is not perfectly isolated either , and moreover leads to entangling gates that are slower than their one - qubit counterparts , and _ ( iii ) _ the tools to process the information introduce additional external sources of noise .",
    "this becomes even more challenging in light of the so - called fault - tolerance threshold ( ft ) , which imposes stringent conditions as these gates should have errors below @xmath0 for reliable quantum computations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is mandatory that two - qubit entangling gates be robust against the typical sources of noise present in the experiments .",
    "this poses an important technological and theoretical challenge . on the one hand",
    ", technology must be improved to minimize all possible sources of noise .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical schemes must be devised that minimize the sensitivity of the entangling two - qubit gates with respect to the most relevant sources of noise .    with trapped ions  @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to encode a qubit in various manners : there are the so - called `` optical '' , `` zeeman '' and `` hyperfine '' qubits . here , we shall focus on hyperfine qubits . in this approach ,",
    "the qubit states are encoded in two hyperfine levels of the electronic ground - state manifold , and the qubit transition frequency typically lies in the microwave domain .",
    "hyperfine qubits offer the advantage that spontaneous emission from the qubit levels is negligible , in practice .",
    "additionally , one - qubit gates can be implemented via microwave radiation , which has already been shown to allow for errors below the ft  @xcite .    entangling two - qubit gates require a quantum data bus to mediate the interaction between two distant qubits .",
    "the most successful schemes in trapped ions  @xcite make use of the collective vibrations of the ions in a harmonic trap to mediate interactions between the qubits .",
    "the more recent _ driven geometric phase gate _  @xcite , which is the subject of this work , also relies on phonon - mediated interactions and thus requires a qubit - phonon coupling . in the case of hyperfine qubits , the qubit - phonon coupling is not easily provided with microwave radiation . although there are schemes to achieve such a coupling by means of magnetic field gradients  @xcite , spin - phonon coupling is most commonly provided by optical radiation in a so - called stimulated raman configuration . in this setup ,",
    "transitions between the qubit levels are off - resonantly driven via a third auxiliary level from the excited state manifold by a pair of laser beams .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the direct microwave coupling , spontaneous photon emission may occur , which acts as an additional source of noise with detrimental effects on the gate performance  @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we will complement the analysis of the driven geometric phase gate in the presence of noise  @xcite , where we showed its built - in resilience to thermal fluctuations , dephasing noise , and drifts of the laser phases .",
    "there , we also explored the behavior of the gate with respect to microwave intensity noise , and proposed ways to increase its robustness . in this manuscript",
    ", we consider two additional sources of noise that are present in experiments , namely laser intensity fluctuations and residual spontaneous emission .",
    "the first part of the manuscript is devoted to the study of the stimulated raman configuration , and the derivation of an effective dynamics within the qubit manifold using the formalism of  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to obtain expressions for the desired qubit - phonon coupling and the residual spontaneous emission .",
    "we then use these expressions to analyze the effects of photon scattering by numerically simulating the gate dynamics in such a stimulated raman configuration .",
    "subsequently , we investigate the performance of the gate in the presence of laser intensity fluctuations .",

    "this process is termed raman scattering .",
    "it is clear that both of the processes will have a detrimental effect on the entangling gate .",
