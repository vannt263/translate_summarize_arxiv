    "radiative capture reactions play an important role in stellar nucleosynthesis . at temperatures relevant to these events the corresponding relative energies between the participating nuclei are mainly in the sub mev scale .",
    "direct measurements of reaction cross section at these low energies are often very difficult .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath0n(@xmath5)@xmath2n reaction direct measurements have been possible only at few energies below 500 kev @xcite . the situation can be addressed by an indirect method like the coulomb dissociation method , wherein capture cross sections at low energies can be obtained from coulomb dissociation measurements at higher energies .",
    "the @xmath6c(@xmath5)@xmath0c @xcite and @xmath7li(@xmath5)@xmath8li @xcite neutron capture reactions are two recent examples where the coulomb dissociation method have been used to calculate the corresponding radiative capture cross section",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to investigate if in the case of @xmath0n(@xmath5)@xmath2n too indirect measurements add to a better understanding of capture cross sections at low energies .",
    "the radiative neutron capture @xmath0n(@xmath1)@xmath2n reaction , plays an important role in the synthesis of heavy elements by @xmath9-process nucleosynthesis in red giant stars and also in the inhomogeneous big bang model @xcite .",
    "this reaction is also a part of the neutron induced chain which leads to the breakout from the cno cycle and hence depletion of cno abundances @xcite .",
    "being the competing reaction with @xmath0n(@xmath10)@xmath11f , the neutron capture @xmath0n(@xmath1)@xmath2n reaction is also important in determining the abundance of fluorine @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is also thought to compete with charged particle capture reactions on @xmath0n @xcite and therefore can affect the abundance of heavier mass elements .",
    "the only direct measurement of the @xmath0n(@xmath1)@xmath2n capture cross section has been performed at neutron lab energies of 25 , 152 and 370 kev by meissner _",
    "the direct capture calculations performed in order to explain the data using experimental spectroscopic factor ( @xmath12 ) @xcite , show a @xmath13-wave dominated capture .",
    "these @xmath12 had an inherent uncertainity of 30@xmath14 .",
    "further , their calculated reaction rates were @xmath15 smaller than those calculated by rauscher _",
    "theoretical calculations by herndl",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in the framework of a hybrid compound and direct capture model ( @xmath12 from ref .",
    "@xcite ) were used to explain the data @xcite and their calculated rates were in agreement with those of ref .",
    "another direct capture calculation has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite using potential model @xcite with @xmath12 from ref . @xcite .",
    "in fact , the capture cross section and the rate of the @xmath0n(@xmath1)@xmath2n reaction strongly depends upon the @xmath12 of the four low - lying levels ( with spin - parity @xmath16 2@xmath17 , 0@xmath17 , 3@xmath17 and 1@xmath17 ) in @xmath2n .",
    "the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , could account for the data only when the suggested 30% uncertainty in the @xmath12 from ref .",
    "@xcite were considered .",
    "but this was not the case with the calculations of ref .",
    "a point also to be noted is that the experimentally extracted @xmath12 in ref .",
    "@xcite are almost half as those calculated from shell model @xcite , which gives a pure single particle picture of these levels . in this regard ,",
    "an experiment was performed by bardayan _",
    "@xcite , where they extracted the @xmath12 for all these four levels , from the measured angular distribution of @xmath0n(@xmath18)@xmath2n .",
    "these @xmath12 values obtained were close to unity and were in good agreement with those suggested by the shell model @xcite",
    ". however , the @xmath12 values extracted in a recent experiment @xcite from the measured angular distribution of @xmath0n(@xmath19li , @xmath20li)@xmath2n , are not in full agreement with either of the previous experiments @xcite .",
    "their @xmath12 values suggest that the two levels of @xmath2n ( with j@xmath21 = 2@xmath17 and 3@xmath17 ) are good single - particle levels whereas , the other two ( with j@xmath21 = 0@xmath17 and 1@xmath17 ) are not .    with this background we present an indirect method of calculating the @xmath0n(@xmath1)@xmath2n radiative capture cross section from the coulomb breakup of @xmath2n on pb at 100 mev / u beam energy .",
    "the coulomb breakup theory is fully quantum mechanical and is calculated under the post - form finite range distorted wave born approximation ( frdwba ) @xcite .",
    "the theory is mainly analytic in nature given that pure coulomb wave functions are used in the calculation and that the dynamics can be exactly evaluated .",
    "thus , the main aim of this paper is to use this theory to calculate the @xmath0n(@xmath1)@xmath2n radiative capture cross section and its subsequent reaction rate by an indirect method and in that process investigate the effects of @xmath12 of different levels of @xmath2n to the cross section .",
    "previously this theory has been successfully applied to calculate the radiative neutron capture cross sections and subsequent rates of the reactions @xmath22li@xmath23li @xcite and @xmath6c@xmath24c @xcite from the coulomb breakup of @xmath25li and @xmath0c , respectively .",

    "section [ sec:2 ] , contains a brief formalism of the coulomb breakup process and the capture cross section . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we present our results , where we discuss the capture cross section and rate of the @xmath0n(@xmath5)@xmath2n reaction from the coulomb dissociation of @xmath2n and finally in section [ sec:4 ] we present our conclusions .",

    "we shall show subsequently ( section [ sec:3.3 ] ) that the significant contribution to the reaction rate comes from a very small range of energies and hence the whole integration range in the above equation need not be considered .    in case of narrow resonances ,",
    "the capture cross section can be obtained by using the breit - wigner formula .",

    "apart from these , the 862 kev resonance is the only relevant resonance which has been suggested to contribute to the reaction rate at high temperature ( @xmath100 gk ) @xcite .    in our study , we calculate the bound state wave function of the projectile ( which is the only input in our theory ) by assuming a woods - saxon interaction between the valence neutron and the charged core .",

    "in fact , these are also supported by the experiment performed in ref .",
