    "the characterization of isolated attosecond pulses has played an important role in the development of attosecond science @xcite .",
    "the generation and application of ever shorter attosecond extreme - ultraviolet ( xuv ) pulses @xcite relies on knowledge of their time - domain properties , which can be obtained by means of attosecond streaking measurements @xcite .",
    "so far , the main functions of attosecond streaking are ( i ) to characterize the field of an attosecond pulse and ( ii ) to temporally resolve a physical process on the attosecond scale . here",
    ", we are concerned with the former application of attosecond streaking , that of characterizing an attosecond pulse .",
    "much effort has been exerted on the development of methods for extracting physical information from the streaking measurement @xcite , with the current state - of - the - art being the frog retrieval algorithm @xcite .",
    "the frog algorithm has already been used to characterize the shortest attosecond pulses @xcite , and to uncover a measured delay of @xmath0 between photoemissions from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sub - shells of neon @xcite .",
    "it is relatively robust @xcite , and provides a wealth of information about the temporal characteristics of the attosecond and laser fields @xcite .",
    "however , the application of frog to attosecond streaking requires quite stringent experimental requirements , such as a sufficient amount of recorded spectra , with a delay step between them on the order of the attosecond pulse s duration .",
    "these experimental parameters become unwieldy as the duration of attosecond pulses approaches the atomic unit of time . moreover ,",
    "the frog algorithm is a somewhat complicated numerical optimization procedure , whose output ( the attosecond field and the laser field ) is not transparently related to the input ( the set of streaked spectra ) .",
    "thus , errors in the reconstructed pulses are difficult to interpret due to the frog algorithm s black - box nature .",
    "although frog provides a complete characterization of the attosecond xuv field , the _ duration _ of the attosecond pulse is the primordial quantity that will be interrogated as attosecond streaking continues to expand beyond its original scope into various research fields .    in this article",
    ", we introduce a simple and robust method for quantifying the chirp of an attosecond pulse based on an analytical formula we derive from laser - dressed photoelectron trajectories . using this formula ,",
    "we develop a method that _ directly _ evaluates the attosecond pulse s group - delay dispersion from a sequence of streaked spectra , which in turn sets the pulse s duration provided its spectrum is known .",
    "our method avoids the stringent experimental conditions required for the attosecond frog technique , and provides accurate results with very few electron spectra in a matter of seconds .",
    "we begin this article with the derivation of the analytical expression for the change in photoelectron bandwidth due to the streaking effect , and then introduce our method with a numerical example .",
    "all quantities are expressed in atomic units unless otherwise stated .",
    "let us first consider an attosecond xuv pulse with electric field @xmath3 given by    [ attosecond_field ] @xmath4    where the spectrum of the attosecond pulse is centered at @xmath5 with small variations in frequency due to the higher - order temporal phase @xmath6 .",
    "the attosecond pulse launches electron trajectories that are parameterized with an initial time @xmath7 as well as an electron energy @xmath8 . due to the attosecond pulse",
    "s finite _ bandwidth _ , we consider the energy @xmath9 as an independent variable , while the independent variable @xmath7 is a result of the finite _ duration _ of the attosecond pulse .",
    "thus , the set of trajectories is described by a time - energy distribution with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "the final energy @xmath11 of an electron , launched at some moment @xmath7 in a continuum permeated by a near - infrared ( nir ) laser field , is then    @xmath12    where we define the instantaneous frequency @xmath13 due to the chirp of the attosecond pulse , and @xmath14 is the vector potential of the laser field .",
    "since the change in frequency over the temporal profile of the attosecond pulse is much smaller than the central frequency @xmath5 , the last term in ( [ final_energy_approx ] ) is comparably small and can be dropped , leading to the simple relation @xmath15 for the shift of the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "it is known @xcite that the spectral shift alone is not sufficient to obtain information about the attosecond pulse s chirp because the final energy @xmath11 is hardly sensitive to the temporal phase @xmath6 of the attosecond pulse .",
    "the main manifestation of the attosecond chirp in the streaking measurement is the change in breadth of the streaked photoelectron spectrum . to describe this effect , we interpret ( [ final_energy ] ) as a mapping of the initial time and energy of an electron trajectory to a final energy ( e.g. measured at the detector ) . to describe the effect of chirp",
    ", it is useful to consider small changes @xmath16 in the final energy with respect to small changes in the initial energy @xmath17 and time @xmath18 of the trajectory .",
    "the total differential of ( [ final_energy ] ) is then @xmath19 where we again neglect the small terms containing @xmath20 . the temporal phase of the attosecond pulse appears in ( [ total_differential ] ) as @xmath21 , which defines the _ chirp _ of the attosecond pulse .",
    "we have also introduced the electric field of the laser pulse @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the chirp of the attosecond pulse and the electric field of the laser pulse both influence the spread in final energies resulting from the streaking effect .",
    "to proceed further , we interpret the effects of the nir field on the time - energy distribution of electron trajectories , as described by ( [ total_differential ] ) , in a straightforward manner .",
    "initial inspection of ( [ total_differential ] ) shows that the nir field imparts an additional energy sweep of @xmath23 to the photoelectron , resulting in a total chirp @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , the nir field re - scales the energy spread by a factor @xmath25 . as a result , both the nir electric field @xmath26 and the nir vector potential @xmath14 have a role in modifying the breadth of the photoelectron spectrum .    in order to account for the effects of the streaking field , we recall that the attosecond electron wave packet can be viewed as a replica @xcite of the attosecond pulse @xmath3 .",
    "we model this photoelectron replica as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the central photoelectron energy . naturally , since the electron trajectories are launched by the attosecond pulse , the duration @xmath29 of the electron wave packet @xcite should be nearly the same as that of the attosecond pulse ; and as @xmath30 is a replica of @xmath3 , its chirp @xmath31 is the same as that of the attosecond pulse . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume @xmath31 to be constant and we also assume that the attosecond pulse is shorter than any relevant time scale of the nir field , so that @xmath26 and @xmath14 are evaluated at the central time @xmath32 of the attosecond pulse .",
    "now , in order to include the effects of the streaking field , we first consider the shift of the photoelectron spectrum due to @xmath33 and the change in bandwidth due to the chirp induced by @xmath34 . to this end ,",
    "we modify the wave packet s central energy @xmath35 and chirp @xmath31 as follows :    [ modelling_a_streaked_wave_packet ] @xmath36    with these substitutions , the _ streaked _ photoelectron wave packet is modeled as @xmath37 to obtain an expression for the bandwidth of the streaked photoelectron spectrum , we note that the streaked photoelectron spectrum is just a fourier - transform of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "since the streaked wave packet is a gaussian , the fourier transform of @xmath38 can be carried out analytically , yielding the following expression for the bandwidth of the streaked spectrum :    [ streaked_bandwidth ] @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent the bandwidth and group - delay dispersion ( gdd)defined as the second derivative of the spectral phase  of the attosecond pulse .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 is the attosecond pulse s time - bandwidth product , with a fourier - limited time - bandwidth product @xmath43 ( @xmath44 for a gaussian spectrum ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath29 , @xmath40 and @xmath45 are all taken as standard deviations of their respective distributions . according to ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] )",
    ", @xmath41 determines the width @xmath45 of the streaked spectrum as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "provided that the characteristics of the field - free spectrum ( @xmath5 , @xmath40 and @xmath43 ) as well as those of the laser field ( @xmath14 and @xmath26 ) are known , @xmath41 remains the only free parameter .    in writing ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] ) , we also explicitly included the energy re - scaling pre - factor @xmath46 .",
    "similar but less general expressions for the streaked photoelectron bandwidth were previously derived in @xcite from the semi - classical expression for streaking @xcite .",
    "these expressions consider photoionization at the zero - crossing of the vector potential , @xmath47 , where there is no spectral shift but only a change in spectral bandwidth due to the nir field .",
    "these expressions therefore do not contain the bandwidth re - scaling factor @xmath46 , which is needed to accurately represent the bandwidth of the streaked spectra at arbitrary delay times @xmath32 , when the nir field simultaneously shifts the photoelectron spectrum and changes its bandwidth .",
    "although ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] ) was deduced assuming a gaussian wave packet , it actually applies to more general pulse shapes owing to the fact that the relation @xmath48 holds for arbitrary spectra with a constant gdd ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the following section presents numerical examples in further support of this claim .",
    "equation ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] ) serves as the basis for our method to extract the attosecond chirp from a streaking measurement .",
    "our procedure is very straightforward : we evaluate the first moments ( @xmath11 ) of the streaked spectra to obtain the laser field s vector potential @xmath14 , which in turn gives us the laser s electric field @xmath26 .",
    "we also compute a curve @xmath49 of standard deviations of the measured streaked spectra as a function of the xuv - nir delay @xmath32 .",
    "lastly , we find the attosecond chirp @xmath41the only free parameter in ( [ streaked_bandwidth])which minimizes the discrepancy between the widths @xmath49 obtained from the set of streaked spectra and those given by the model ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] ) . to compare these two , we define a figure of merit @xmath50 where the sums range over the xuv - nir delays @xmath51 .",
    "the goal of our procedure is to find @xmath41 that best reproduces the measured curve @xmath52 according to model ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] ) .",
    "as an example , we consider the case of a non - gaussian @xmath53 xuv pulse .",
    "this pulse has a constant gdd of @xmath54 .",
    "however , since its spectrum ( figure [ streaking_example]-b ) is irregular ( @xmath55 ) , i.e. it is asymmetric and contains some fine structure , its chirp @xmath31 is time - dependent . the streaking field is a nir pulse given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 , yielding a @xmath58 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) duration , @xmath59 corresponding to a central wavelength of @xmath60 and with @xmath61 , giving a peak intensity of @xmath62 .",
    "for this example , we consider carrier - envelope phase values of @xmath63 ( figure [ streaking_example]-a ) and @xmath64 ( figure [ streaking_example]-b ) .    the simulated streaking measurements , shown in figure [ streaking_example]-a and figure [ streaking_example]-b , are composed of a sequence of streaked spectra computed for different delays between the xuv and nir fields by propagating the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) using a split - step fft scheme .",
    "the hamiltonian is that of a single electron in one dimension , assuming a soft - core potential with an ionization energy @xmath65 .",
    "the results of our analytical chirp evaluation ( ace ) procedure , applied to the spectrograms shown in figures [ streaking_example]-a and [ streaking_example]-b , are shown in figures [ chirp_extraction ] and [ chirp_extraction_sine_pulse ] . in both cases ,",
    "we have applied ace to different subsets of streaked spectra , by considering a varying number @xmath66 of spectra about the central delay value @xmath67 .    for the case",
    "@xmath63 , figure [ chirp_extraction]-a shows a false - color plot of the figure of merit @xmath68 as defined in ( [ figure_of_merit ] ) .",
    "darker areas correspond to a smaller value of @xmath68 .",
    "when too few spectra are considered , figure [ chirp_extraction]-a shows a local minimum near @xmath69 which disappears as more spectra ( @xmath70 ) are considered . nonetheless , figure [ chirp_extraction]-b shows that we recover the exact gdd ( the dashed line ) from the global minimum to within @xmath71 with as few as three spectra .",
    "as @xmath66 increases , the global minimum eventually stabilizes around the red dashed line representing the exact gdd , and ace converges nearly to the exact value @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ chirp_extraction]-c shows that the model ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] ) reproduces the correct curve @xmath45 for the exact gdd .",
    "in contrast , we found that the attosecond frog retrieval @xcite fails to converge when fewer than 25 spectra are included , for which it recovers a gdd @xmath73 .    for @xmath64 , figure [",
    "chirp_extraction_sine_pulse]-ashows that the figure of merit has only one minimum as a function of gdd .",
    "this minimum quickly converges to the correct gdd as more spectra are considered in the evaluation , as displayed in figure [ chirp_extraction_sine_pulse]-b , and is already accurate to within @xmath74 for @xmath75 spectra .",
    "figure [ chirp_extraction_sine_pulse]-c shows that the model ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] ) once again reproduces the correct curve ( hollow circles ) of streaked breadths for the exact gdd @xmath76 .",
    "the main advantage of the ace procedure is that it requires very few spectra .",
    "as long as @xmath33 is properly sampled by the delay step between the spectra , there is enough information for ace to recover the gdd of the attosecond pulse .",
    "in contrast , frog requires the delay step to be on the order of the attosecond pulse s duration . to illustrate this point",
    ", we apply ace to a subset of the spectra shown in figure [ streaking_example]-a and [ streaking_example]-b . specifically , we consider @xmath77 spectra over the interval @xmath78 $ ] ( containing @xmath79 cycles of the streaking field ) , with a delay step of @xmath80 between them , i.e. a third of the original spectra in @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "even with so few spectra , ace still recovered accurate gdd s of @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", frog failed to converge to anything meaningful in both cases , most likely because the delay step was too large .    to further demonstrate ace s robustness against a non - gaussian spectrum",
    ", we consider a clipped version of the xuv spectrum shown in figure [ streaking_example]-c , for which we remove energy components above @xmath84 .",
    "experimentally , such a sharp edge in the xuv spectrum might result from the beam s transmission through a metallic filter . using the clipped xuv spectrum , we compute sets of @xmath85 streaked photoelectron spectra , with the same parameters as those displayed in figure [ streaking_example]-a and [ streaking_example]-b . in spite of this heavy clipping ,",
    "ace recovers gdd s of @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . in comparison",
    ", frog recovers a gdd of @xmath88 for both @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "as previously mentioned , these examples assume a constant gdd over an irregular spectral distribution , resulting in a chirp @xmath31 that depends on time .",
    "since expression ( [ streaked_bandwidth])which is at the core of the ace procedure  assumes a constant chirp in time , then the chirp parameter @xmath31 is interpreted as the _ average _ chirp over the attosecond pulse s temporal profile .",
    "conversely , if a non - uniform gdd was considered , then ace would have recovered the _ average _ gdd over the spectral profile .    as an additional verification of ace s robustness ,",
    "we investigate the effect of noise in the streaked spectra . to this end , we add noise to the sets of @xmath85 spectra shown in figure [ streaking_example]-a and [ streaking_example]-b .",
    "we assume that the number of counts @xmath89 in a spectral bin follows a poisson distribution @xmath90 , with an expectation value @xmath91 proportional to the spectral intensity ( we set @xmath92 for the peak of the spectrogram , corresponding to a very low count rate ) . from these considerations",
    ", we compute the noisy spectra which are shown in figure [ noisy_spectrograms ] .    even under such nefarious conditions , ace recovers accurate values of the gdd : @xmath93 from the spectrogram shown in figure [ noisy_spectrograms]-a , and @xmath94 from the one in figure [ noisy_spectrograms]-b . in comparison ,",
    "frog recovers gdd s of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "this example demonstrates that ace can tolerate very noisy spectra , and moreover that it is robust against errors in the vector potential @xmath33 , as determined from the streaked spectra .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived a general analytical expression ( [ streaked_bandwidth ] ) for the change in spectral breadth due to the streaking effect by considering the trajectories of a photoelectron ejected by an isolated attosecond pulse in a laser field .",
    "we have used this equation as a basis for a method to directly extract the attosecond chirp from a sequence of streaked spectra .",
    "in contrast to the attosecond frog retrieval , the ace procedure does not require streaked spectra to be recorded with a delay step on the order of the attosecond pulse duration : it only requires the delay step to properly sample the streaking field .",
    "this alleviates many of the experimental constraints related to the current approaches to characterize isolated attosecond pulses .",
    "in addition , the ace procedure is simple to implement , robust against experimental artifacts , and fast  taking seconds to execute and requiring very few ( @xmath97 ) streaked spectra .",
    "this makes ace ideal for real - time diagnostics in attosecond streaking measurements .",
    "the authors are grateful for discussions with f. krausz .",
    "this work was supported by the max planck society and the dfg cluster of excellence : munich centre for advanced photonics ( map ) .",
    "the final publication is available at www.springerlink.com",
    "the following is a proof of the general relation @xmath98 between the duration @xmath99 , the fourier - limited duration @xmath100 , the bandwidth @xmath101 and the group - delay dispersion ( gdd ) @xmath102 for a pulse with an arbitrary spectrum and a constant gdd ; @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are taken as standard deviations of their respective distributions .",
    "the duration @xmath99 is defined as the standard deviation of @xmath105 , which is the square - root of the variance @xmath108(t)\\right|^2\\mathrm{d}t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following derivation , the prime symbol ( `` @xmath109 '' ) denotes differentiation with respect to the argument and the pulse is normalized according to @xmath110 .",
    "assuming @xmath102 is frequency - independent , then ( [ spec_profile ] ) implies @xmath111 . inserting this expression for @xmath112 into the rightmost - hand - side of ( [ duration_tau ] ) , we obtain      in analogy to ( [ duration_tau ] ) , the bandwidth - limited duration is given by @xmath114(t)\\right|^2\\mathrm{d}t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are fourier transforms of each other .",
    "thus , from parseval s theorem , we have @xmath117 where ( [ bandwidth - limited_duration_tau0 ] ) in combination with parseval s theorem was used for the last equation on the rhs of ( [ parseval_i ] ) .        @xmath122\\mathrm{d}t\\\\    \\label{duration_tau_4 }    & = \\tau_0 ^ 2+\\gamma^2\\delta^2 + 2\\gamma\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathfrak{i}[\\omega \\tilde{f}'_0(\\omega)\\tilde{f}^*_0(\\omega)]\\mathrm{d}\\omega,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used @xmath123(t)$ ] and @xmath124(t)$ ] to obtain ( [ duration_tau_4 ] ) .",
    "now , if the pulse s gdd is constant over its spectrum , @xmath125 is a strictly _ real _ quantity , and therefore the last term on the rhs of ( [ duration_tau_4 ] ) is equal to zero , yielding ( [ bandiwdth - dispersion - duration_relation ] ) .",
    "@xmath126    relation ( [ bandiwdth - dispersion - duration_relation ] ) is the reason why the ace procedure can be applied for arbitrary xuv spectra ( of course , provided that the attosecond pulse is short compared to the half - period of the streaking field ) ."
