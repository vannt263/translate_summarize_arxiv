    "the exact renormalization group ( rg ) equation @xcite ( erge ) also called non - perturbative or functional rg equation can not be concretely used without recourse to approximation ( for modern reviews or introductory lectures see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the best known approximation framework for",
    "the erge is the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "the leading order of that expansion , @xmath3-order , also named the local potential approximation ( lpa ) @xcite , completely discards any momentum dependence from the study . in principle",
    "the lpa amounts to projecting the rg flow of the complete action @xmath4 $ ] ( a functional of the field @xmath5 ) onto the space of simple functions @xmath6 of a uniform field @xmath7 by assuming that:@xmath8 = \\omega _ { d}\\,u\\left ( \\phi \\right )   \\label{1}\\]]where @xmath9 is the volume of the @xmath10-dimensional space .    due to its simplicity and",
    "because it is thought that it qualitatively involves most of the properties of the complete erge in the large distance regime ( e.g. , stability properties and number of fixed points ) , the lpa is currently utilized in many studies .",
    "numerically , the lpa is considered as a reasonable approximation because the estimations of the critical properties would only be vitiated by the obligatory zero value of the critical exponent @xmath0 ( characterizing the large distance behavior of the two - point correlation function at the critical point ) which , in many circumstances , is actually a small parameter .    in the early studies ,",
    "the condition @xmath2 in the lpa has been justified as a consequence of the neglect of the detailed momentum dependence in the rg  @xcite ( the same kind of justification of @xmath2 may be found in @xcite ) . though this argumentation by default is sometimes reused @xcite",
    ", it is not very strong .",
    "it has been argued that , in the lpa , _ it is not possible to consistently determine _",
    "@xmath0 , or @xmath0 _ is set to zero as there is no mechanism to determine",
    "_  its value  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the alert reader could express some surprise and argue that the vanishing of @xmath0 in the lpa has been clearly demonstrated a long time ago by hasenfratz and hasenfratz @xcite as often put forward in current studies ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the arguments are not unassailable because they rely , at least allusively ( see section [ invalidity ] ) , on the following truncation of @xmath11 $ ] : @xmath8 = \\omega _ { d}\\,u\\left ( \\phi \\right ) + \\frac{\\bar{z}}{2}% \\int d^{d}x\\left ( \\partial _ { x}\\phi \\left ( x\\right ) \\right ) ^{2 }   \\label{2}\\]]in which the coefficient @xmath12 of the kinetic term would be maintained unaltered ( equal to unity ) along a rg flow of @xmath13 . a condition which would imply @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "pending to show that the argument is actually artificial ( see section [ invalidity ] ) , we may already notice that truncation ( [ 2 ] ) differs in nature from the pure lpa ( [ 1 ] ) since it refers partly to the @xmath14-order of the derivative expansion .",
    "consequently , assuming it was correct , this currently accepted argument , basis of what is referred to in the following as the conventional lpa , spoils the logic of the expansion based on a systematic projection of the complete erge onto the space of actions successively truncated according to the number of the derivatives of the field @xmath5 .",
    "normally the lpa should correspond to ( [ 1 ] ) and not to ( [ 2 ] ) so that the supposedly proof of @xcite , even true , would be inappropriate .",
    "hence , only remains the poor default argument .",
    "it is then legitimate to wonder whether the condition @xmath2 is actually obligatory in the pure lpa .",
    "it is a matter of fact that the conventional value @xmath2 in the lpa not accidentally but associated with a systematic absence of field renormalization raises some questions :    1 .",
    "the absence of any field renormalization precludes in the lpa the eventual setting up of a non - classical power law behavior of correlation functions at criticality @xcite other than that purely induced by a diverging correlation length .",
    "according to the theory of critical phenomena , two critical exponents are necessary to determine all the other critical indices of a second order critical point . with the erge considered around a wilson - fisher - like ( wf ) of the correlation length . ]",
    "fixed point @xcite , these two exponents are @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "the two exponents arise differently in the erge . the index @xmath15 ( which characterizes the divergence of the correlation length @xmath16 when the temperature @xmath17 approaches its critical value @xmath18 ) occurs as a positive eigenvalue of the rg equation linearized around a fixed point ( the number of such positive values determines the order of the transition ) .",
    "the role of the index @xmath0 is more subtle .",
    "it is associated with the field renormalization allowing for a non - classical power law behavior of the correlation function at criticality .",
    "usually one introduces @xmath0 in order to reproduce the critical behavior of the correlation function at large distances ( momenta going to zero ) and @xmath19 ; this manner of doing tightly links the field renormalization to the momentum dependence and suggests that no field renormalization is required when the momentum dependence is neglected @xcite implying @xmath20 .",
    "however , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem relates the correlation function to the susceptibility .",
    "this allows another introduction of @xmath0 via the critical exponent @xmath21 characterizing the critical behavior of the two - point correlation function at zero momenta and @xmath22 .",
    "no reference to an explicit momentum is required in that case but the field should be renormalized nonetheless ( to take this eventual non - trivial power law with @xmath23 into account ) . in the lpa ( conventional or not )",
    "@xmath15 takes on a non - classical value 6137 when the fixed point is a non - trivial one .",
    "then , there is a priori no reason why @xmath24 would take on  a classical value at this fixed point ( a priori no reason for keeping the field unrenormalized ) .",

    ", the reparametrization invariance of the complete erge is expected to be progressively restored as the order of the expansion grows .",
    "when it is satisfied , this invariance specifies , in particular , that a change of normalization of the field by a pure constant [ like the parameter @xmath12 in ( [ 2 ] ) ] generates a line of equivalent fixed points characterized by a unique set of critical exponents with the joint existence of a zero eigenvalue mode in the solutions of the erge linearized around those fixed points .",
    "the breaking of that invariance by the derivative expansion has been concretely observed at next - to - leading order [ @xmath14-order ] @xcite ; it is such that , for a given smooth cutoff function , a line of fixed points is well generated by the change of normalization of @xmath7 but those fixed points are not equivalent .",
    "nonetheless , in agreement with a remark of bell and wilson @xcite in such a situation , one observes the existence at @xmath25-order of a vestige of the invariance via an extremum by a constant factor @xmath26 .",

    "thus , considered as the leading order of that expansion , the conventional treatment creates confusion about the convergence property of the derivative expansion .",
    "this is a pity because the issue is of some importance .",
    "3 .   [ etadet]having defined the rg - time @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 the running cutoff scale and @xmath30 an arbitrary fixed momentum scale ) the critical exponent @xmath31",
    "is actually defined in the rg as the limit of a function @xmath32 on approaching a given fixed point ( when @xmath33 ) . according to wilson s prescriptions @xcite ,",
    "the function @xmath32 is determined by keeping fixed the coefficient of one particular  term in the action @xmath34 $ ] with the initial condition @xmath35 .",
    "it is customary to keep constant the coefficient @xmath12 of the kinetic term because , due to a symmetry of the action linked to the reparametrization invariance , the flow of such a term is non - essential ( redundant ) so that it may be constrained without altering the model integrity .",
    "when the kinetic term is not part of the approximation , as in the pure lpa , the redundancy still exists at least formally and it seems logical to wonder what the state of the reparametrization process is in the pure lpa . to this end one should introduce a function @xmath36 that would maintain fixed a particular  monomial of @xmath37 . the line of fixed points mentioned in point [ invariance ]",
    "would presumably be generated and this would give back the status of genuine leading order [ @xmath3-order ] of the derivative expansion to the lpa ( see section [ revisedlpa ] ) .    in section [ revisedlpa ]",
    "we present and discuss a version of the lpa with @xmath38 .",
    "we show that it satisfies all the required conditions for being a genuine @xmath3-order of the derivative expansion .",
    "in particular we study , in section [ fixedpoints ] , the structure of the fixed points for any value of the dimension @xmath10 and show explicitly , for the first time in the lpa , how the reparametrization invariance is broken .",
    "we also introduce , in section [ lt ] , a legendre transformation of the potential adapted to the case studied ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this allows us to utilize easy quasi - analytic methods ( section [ tsm ] ) of integration of an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) well adapted to the obtention of the eigenvalues of the rg flow linearized around a fixed point .",
    "it is then shown that the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) does not necessarily indicate preferred values of the critical exponents ( section pms ) . in section [ versuspseudolpa ] ,",
    "we first show that the conventional argument which is generally put forward to justify @xmath2 in the lpa , is actually artificial ( section [ invalidity ] ) .",
    "we then discuss briefly , according to the rg rules , how the reparametrization invariance could be studied  with the partial truncation ( [ 2 ] ) ( section pseudolpa ) . in appendix [ movable ] , we illustrate some reason why the quasi - analytic methods of integration of ode of section [ tsm ] do not work in the case of the potential of the action whereas they work after a legendre transformation is performed . we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",

    "we do it such that @xmath68 all along the rg flow , with the initial condition @xmath35 and @xmath69 a constant independent of @xmath70 . at the fixed point ( reached at infinite rg - time",

    "of course , in the pure lpa one rather expects to observe the breaking of that marvelous property and the  true question is : to which extent is that invariance broken in the lpa ?    to look at this question , suffices to express the variation of @xmath74 in terms of @xmath75 .",

    "notice that the perfect breaking of the reparametrization invariance does not completely spoil the universal character of the critical behavior since the infinite number of initial potentials with a given @xmath122 lying on the critical surface are characterized by the same critical behavior governed by a unique value of @xmath45 and , subsidiarily , of the other critical exponents .    from the line @xmath111 , it is also interesting to notice that non - trivial fixed points may be formally considered as existing for @xmath119 provided that @xmath45 be strictly negative .",
    "usually such fixed points are rejected but in the present study there is no reason to reject them  a priori since it is a consequence of the breaking of the reparametrization invariance to generate also negative values of @xmath124 .",
    "it would be puzzling however if a vestige of that invariance led us to choose such a negative value of @xmath45 .",
    "fortunately we observe no sign of such a preferred value of @xmath45 along the line @xmath125 except the limit case @xmath106 .    at this level",
    "we conclude that the lpa does not allow one to determine any estimate of @xmath45 but only ranges of possible values .",
    "for example , if one excludes negative values of @xmath126 then for @xmath78 this range would be @xmath127  for the only line @xmath128 , the other lines being excluded .",
    "from this example taken alone , one could be inclined to conclude that the conventional lpa , by imposing @xmath101 , would be merely a reasonable choice since one knows that @xmath45 is most often small",
    ". however , fig .",
    "( [ figpf1 ] ) shows that from @xmath129 down to @xmath76 , emerges a rich structure of various fixed points with possible different positive and growing values of @xmath45 for which the conventional lpa would impose , increasingly poorly as @xmath10 decreases , the same zero value ( one knows that at @xmath76 , @xmath130 what is not small ) .",

    "hence , if a direct derivative of the fixed point equation with respect to @xmath26 shows that an extremum of @xmath135 implies the appearance of a zero eigenvalue , the reverse is not true .    in order to better illustrate the role of the zero mode in the process of restoration of the reparametrization invariance ,",
    "let us look at the critical exponents in the lpa and at their variations on changing the normalization of the field . to this end",

    "the purely numerical shooting method necessitates a skillful adjustment of an initial guess of the final value of @xmath136 or , independently , of each critical exponent sought .",

    "firstly the finite character of the radius of convergence of the series limits the accuracy of the method @xcite .",

    "the solution of the ode is thus expressed as :    @xmath143    where @xmath144 is the expansion point chosen to coincide with the minimum of the potential arbitrarily and the two unknowns would have been @xmath67 and @xmath145 .",
    "this would offer the possibility of improving the apparent convergence of the taylor method by varying @xmath146 , see @xcite . ] since @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , whereas the original connection parameter is , by definition , given by:@xmath149there are two unknowns ( @xmath67 and @xmath146 ) to be determined .",
    "the taylor method consists of imposing the vanishing of the two last terms of the taylor series to get two auxiliary conditions on @xmath67 and @xmath146 .",
    "this method may improve considerably the simplistic method ( it has provided excellent estimates of the critical exponents in the lpa @xcite ) . the reason is due to the fact that , other things being equal compared to the simplistic method , one starts closer to the movable singularity .",
    "but the taylor method requires that the expansion point ( the minimum of the potential ) lies within the circle of convergence of the maclaurin series ( otherwise one could not get a reliable estimate of @xmath136 by summing the series back to the origin ) . also , the accuracy of the method is naturally limited by the finite range of convergence of the taylor expansion .",

    "this procedure would give nothing new compared to the pure lpa .",
    "this underlines the particular character of that truncation.[pseudofoot ] ] ( the only momentum - dependent monomial of the approximation ) .",

    "finally , imposing the required condition gives a preferred value of @xmath45 defined by:@xmath234    notice that this condition is independent of the choice of the cutoff function , contrary to what is observed with the complete @xmath25-order @xcite ( for another difference with the complete order , see footnote [ pseudofoot ] ) .    in terms of the quantity @xmath235 defined by ( [ mu ] ) and taking into account the change of field variable ( [ changephi ] ) , this condition writes , for @xmath78 and @xmath236 ( see footnote [ gamma])@xmath237    from the calculations done in section [ fixedpoints ] , we obtain:@xmath238which are not excellent values .",
    "this result may however be considered as an improvement compared to the lpa for which no vestige of the reparametrization invariance was observed .",
    "we have justified the presence of a non - vanishing value of @xmath0 in the lpa as a strict consequence of the general principles of the rg theory . without field renormalization , as usually prescribed in the conventional lpa ( with @xmath2 ) , the approximation could not be considered as the genuine @xmath27-order of the derivative expansion . if no particular estimate of @xmath0 can actually be proposed at this order , @xmath31 is not an arbitrary parameter , it varies monotonously ( within some limits ) on changing the normalization of the field as a consequence of a perfect breaking of the reparametrization invariance .",
    "the situation is coherent with the idea that , if the derivative expansion converges then , at least , a progressive and smooth restoration of the invariance must be observed from the few first terms of the expansion ( this was not possible with the conventional view ) . we have done explicit calculations of the lines of fixed points generated by the change of the normalization of the field by a constant @xmath26 using both purely numerical and quasi - analytic methods in order to offer the possibility to anyone to easily redo the calculations .",
    "we also emphasize that , despites the minimum observed ( for @xmath78 ) in the evolution of the critical exponent @xmath15 on varying @xmath26 , the principle of minimal sensitivity can not be applied being not compatible with a possible vestige of the reparametrization invariance in the lpa .",
    "we have shown ( in section [ invalidity ] ) that it is purely artificial the conventional argument stating that @xmath0 should vanish if one keeps the kinetic term unchanged along a rg flow of the potential .",
    "we have illustrated ( in appendix movable ) the respective roles of the movable and fixed singularities of the fixed point solutions in the convergence property of the quasi - analytic methods of integration utilized in the study .",
