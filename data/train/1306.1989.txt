    ", there has been a continuous growing interest in cooling of optomechanical systems to their quantum ground state @xcite .",
    "this field has a potential application in a large variety of sensitive measurements like detection of weak forces @xcite , small masses @xcite and small displacements @xcite . in a pioneering work @xcite",
    ", it has been predicted that the dynamics of back - action arises due to the radiation pressure force by the optical field on the moving mirror of optomechanical systems .",
    "the radiation pressure exerted by an optical field on the moving end mirror of the cavity gives rise to the coupling between the intensity of the intracavity light field and displacement of the mirror .",
    "this nonlinearity arises in the system due to change in the path of light in an intensity - dependent way .",
    "such nonlinear effects have been studied for an optomechanical system consisting of a qw @xcite .",
    "the non - linearity analogous to kerr nonlinearity can be achieved in an optomechanical system @xcite .",
    "two decades ago , moore @xcite discussed the quantization of electromagnetic field in a cavity with movable perfectly reflecting boundaries .",
    "later , dodonov and co - workers @xcite generalized the moore s theory so that the effects of time - varying refractive index of the medium inside the cavity were also included .",
    "the main interest in such kind of system is the creation of photons due to the nonadiabatic distortion of the electromagnetic vacuum state .",
    "it has been presumed that a moving boundary with nonuniform motion @xcite or a fast changes in the refractive index of the cavity medium @xcite can generate real photons from the vacuum state .",
    "this phenomenon is nowadays termed as dynamical casimir effect which was apparently introduced by yablonovitch @xcite and schwinger @xcite .",
    "theoretically , an effective hamiltonian was derived for this type of system consisting of radiation inside a cavity with moving boundary and a time - varying dielectric medium in the cavity @xcite .",
    "it was predicted that a nonadiabatic process characterized by two - photon process helps in creating photon pairs from the vacuum state .",
    "it was identified that this two - photon character of the optical field is related to the squeezing phenomenon @xcite .",
    "further , parametric process can be observed in an optomechanical system by periodically modulating the external driving field which is also efficient in squeezing phenomenon @xcite .    motivated by these interesting features in the field of non - stationary cavity qed",
    ", we propose a system containing a quantum well within an optomechanical cavity undergoing the periodic oscillations .",
    "we investigate this non - stationary system with classical mirror motion and quantized mirror motion .",
    "the cavity frequency is periodically modulated with time .",
    "we examined the fluorescent intensity of light emitted by exciton in qw and the average number of photons within the cavity . in the end , we have proposed a quantum system composed of a qw inside an optomechanical cavity with the fixed cavity frequency and the amplitude modulated external laser pump . in this case",
    ", we observe the amplification of phonons inside the cavity .",
    "in this section , we introduce the basic model of the system with qw in an optomechanical cavity .",
    "the cavity has one mirror fixed and other mirror movable as shown in figure [ b ] .",
    "the system investigated here is composed of a semiconductor qw in an optomechanical cavity driven by an external pump laser and interacting with a single - mode optical field .",
    "the optomechanical cavity has frequency @xmath0 which is driven by an external coherent light field with frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the exciton - exciton scattering is ignored as the density of excitons is small which restricts the exciton - cavity mode to a linear regime . in this section ,",
    "we treat the motion of the movable mirror as a classical harmonic oscillator .",
    "also , the dynamics of this system is studied with time varying cavity frequency . in the present system , the one - dimensional single quantized cavity mode has time - dependent frequency @xmath2 with unperturbed frequency @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the modulation amplitude and @xmath4 is the frequency of the periodic modulation used for time varying cavity frequency .",
    "this particular form of time dependent cavity frequency is a result of the harmonic motion of the cavity mirror .",
    "the time - dependent hamiltonian of the system in the rotating - wave and dipole approximation is given by @xcite    @xmath5    the first term describes the free energy of exciton in the qw . here",
    "@xmath6 is the exciton annihilation ( creation ) operator obeying the commutation relation @xmath7=1\\right)$ ] and @xmath8 is the exciton frequency in the qw .",
    "the second term is the energy of the single optical mode with @xmath9 being the lowering ( raising ) operator for the photon in the cavity which follows the commutation relation as @xmath10=1\\right)$ ] .",
    "the third term depicts the interaction energy between the exciton and photon . here",
    "@xmath11 is the coupling constant for the exciton - photon interaction energy .",
    "the fourth term is due to the two - photon process that arises because of the time - varying cavity field .",
    "this term has close connection with the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator with a time - dependent frequency @xcite . here",
    "@xmath12 is the effective frequency which is arbitrary function of time .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian is the energy due to the external pump laser where @xmath13 is the amplitude of laser pump .",
    "now we will discuss in brief about the fourth term in the hamiltonian .",
    "there are normally two types of nonadiabatic processes in a system composed of an optical cavity with one mirror fixed and other mirror movable as mentioned in ref .",
    "first one is characterized by @xmath14 terms in the hamiltonian . in this type of process",
    ", the total number of photons inside the cavity remains same .",
    "the second one is characterized by the terms @xmath15 or @xmath16 . in this process",
    ", photon pairs can be created from the vacuum state .",
    "this kind of process is known as two - photon process .",
    "this two - photon process is responsible for the fourth term in the hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "it is related to the squeezing phenomenon @xcite . due to the fact that the two - photon character of the optical field helps in creating the photon pairs from the vacuum state , therefore",
    ", it is also used to study the dynamical casimir effect in various systems @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system is fully described when the fluctuation dissipation processes affecting the optical and excitonic modes are included into the system .",
    "the interaction of the system with external degrees of freedom brings the dissipation into the system .",
    "the leakage of photons through the mirrors damps the optomechanical cavity field .",
    "@xmath18 is the decay constant of cavity light field.the spontaneous decay rate of exciton is @xmath19 .",
    "the full dynamics of the system can be described by the following set of quantum langevin equations ( qle ) by taking into account all the dissipative processes in the frame rotating at the frequency @xmath1 :    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the exciton - pump detuning and @xmath23 is the cavity - pump detuning . in the above equations , @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 represent the input vacuum noise of exciton and cavity photons respectively .",
    "their non zero correlation functions are given as follows @xcite    @xmath26    in various studies , there is a relation between the functions @xmath27 and @xmath12 which is given as @xcite    @xmath28    the time modulation with small amplitude is considered for the realistic case i.e. we take @xmath29 .",
    "therefore from eqn . [ fivea ] , we obtain    @xmath30    where @xmath31 .",
    "we solve the coupled qle [ eqs .",
    "[ two ] and [ three ] ] numerically using mathematica 9.0 to study the fluorescent intensity of light emitted by the excitons in the qw .",
    "the dynamics of the system is also studied via the evolution of power @xmath32 .",
    "we have investigated the system under the strong modulation @xmath33 and weak modulation @xmath34 and in two different limits i.e. in the bad cavity limit @xmath35 in the regime @xmath36 and in the good cavity limit @xmath37 in the regime @xmath38 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "figures [ j](a ) and [ j](b ) show the intracavity photon number @xmath39 with scaled time @xmath40 using amplitude modulated external laser pump beam at resonant modulating frequency @xmath41 in the bad cavity limit @xmath42 and for @xmath43 using two modulation amplitudes , @xmath44 ( thick line ) and @xmath45 ( thin line ) .",
    "figure [ j](a ) shows the case of weak modulation @xmath46 .",
    "it shows a rise in the photon number initially which eventually decreases with time .",
    "periodic oscillations are observed gradually in the mean number of intracavity photons .",
    "again , the amplitude of intracavity photon number increases with higher modulation amplitude .",
    "figure [ j](b ) represents the case of strong modulation @xmath47 .",
    "initial rise is observed in the photons inside the cavity which gradually decreases with time .",
    "this clearly illustrates the reverse of two - photon process .",
    "plots [ j](c ) and [ j](d ) show the corresponding fluorescent spectrum of light @xmath48 with scaled time @xmath40 at resonant modulating frequency @xmath41 in the bad cavity limit @xmath42 and for @xmath43 using two modulation amplitudes , @xmath44 ( thick line ) and @xmath45 ( thin line ) .",
    "figure [ j](c ) depicts the case of weak modulation @xmath46 .",
    "it shows periodic oscillations with an initial rise in the intensity of fluorescent light .",
    "this intensity increases with increase in the modulation amplitude .",
    "figure [ j](d ) represents the case of strong modulation @xmath47 .",
    "this plot demonstrates that the fluorescent spectrum increases initially but gradually becomes steady with time .",
    "however , one can notice that there is slight amplification in the intensity of fluorescent light which increases with increase in modulation amplitude .    comparing figures [ i](d ) and [ j](b ) , one can clearly notice that there is enhancement in position dynamics of movable mirror and decrease in the intracavity photon number .",
    "this shows that the external pump force helps in amplifying phonons .",
    "moreover , the intensity of fluorescent light ( see fig . [ j](d ) ) also shows slight amplification implying that the intracavity photons produced due to two - photon process are converted into fluorescence photons .",
    "this clearly illustrates the reverse of two - photon process .    in our calculations ,",
    "the experimentally realizable parameters used for all the three systems are discussed as follows .",
    "the cavity field can have decay rate @xmath49 khz @xcite ( @xmath50 mhz @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency of the mechanical mode in an optomechanical system can be varied from @xmath51 hz @xcite , @xmath52 khz @xcite , to @xmath53 mhz @xcite .",
    "the corresponding damping rate for the optomechanical resonantor can thus be varied from @xmath54 hz @xcite , @xmath55 hz @xcite , to @xmath56 khz @xcite . here",
    "we have also taken an appropriate regime for cooling the optomechanical system to the quantum ground state by considering the cavity - pump detuning to be @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the other parameters used in the present calculations are taken from @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a scheme to study the periodic oscillations in a non - stationary system consisting of a qw inside the optomechanical cavity .",
    "we have analysed the system with classical cavity mirror motion and with quantized cavity mirror motion .",
    "also , the cavity frequency is periodically modulated with time .",
    "the photon number inside the cavities is not steady but it changes with periodic increase and decrease .",
    "amplification is observed in the intracavity photon number with quantized mirror motion .",
    "but the photon number inside the cavity with classical mirror motion show periodic oscillations .",
    "the fluorescent light emitted by the excitons in the qw has also been investigated .",
    "the qw in the optomechanical cavity produces non - periodic damped fluorescent intensity of light when the mirror motion is considered to be classical .",
    "however , the fluorescent spectrum of light emitted by excitons in the qw in an optomechanical cavity with quantized mirror motion , shows amplification under certain regimes .",
    "it is also observed that under the strong modulation , the phenomenon of two - photon process dominates whereas under the weak modulation , the phenomenon of fluorescence dominates .",
    "the system also shows a balance of energy between different degrees of freedom .",
    "the present system provides a good way to detect two - photon process at initial stage of fluorescence spectrum .",
    "furthermore , we have also observed reverse of two - photon process for a non - stationary system composed of a qw confined in an optomechanical cavity with an amplitude modulated external laser pump and constant cavity frequency . significant amplification is observed in the position dynamics of the mirror .",
    "the intracavity photons decreases with time .",
    "thus , the modulation in the external laser beam helps in amplifying the phonons .",
    "the present scheme can be used as an optical switch with two - photon process as an external control parameter .",
