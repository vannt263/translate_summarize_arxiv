    "cavity optomechanics offers a framework to study the coupling between an electromagnetic field and the vibrations of a mechanical resonator .",
    "the interaction between these two systems is usually mediated by a radiation - pressure type coupling proportional  through a coupling constant @xmath0 to the number of photons @xmath1 in the cavity and the displacement of the mechanical resonator .",
    "the radiation pressure coupling offers the possibility of altering the resonant frequency of the mechanical resonator and its damping .",
    "the latter can be used for cooling @xcite or amplification @xcite . moreover",
    ", the nonlinearity of the interaction may allow for the observation of macroscopic quantum phenomena such as quantum superpositon of states @xcite or quantum squeezed states @xcite .",
    "the requirements for observing these quantum phenomena are the necessity of being close to the ground state and being in the strong coupling regime @xcite where @xmath0 is larger than the cavity and the mechanical resonator decay rate .",
    "however , @xmath0 is usually weak and to bypass this constraint a strong drive to the cavity is applied at the cost of losing the nonlinear property of the interaction .",
    "our recent proposal @xcite , in which the cavity and the resonator are coupled to a josephson junction , shows that the interaction between the cavity and the resonator can be enhanced via the non - linearity of the josephson effect .",
    "quadratic and higher - order interactions in the displacement have been investigated also in different setups such as membrane in the middle geometries @xcite .",
    "analogously to the setup mentioned above , the non - linearity of the josephson effect leads to an additional nonlinear interaction , namely a cross - kerr coupling @xmath2 between the cavity and the resonator .",
    "the difference resides in the fact that in the josephson junction setup the relative value of @xmath2 and @xmath0 depends on the value of the gate charge to a superconducting island , whereas in @xcite , it generally reflects the position of the resonator within the cavity .    in the context of optomechanical systems ,",
    "the cross - kerr coupling between the resonator and the cavity induces a change to the refractive index of the cavity depending on the _ number _ of phonons in the resonator , whereas the radiation pressure coupling gives rise to an analogous effect , but depending on the _ displacement _ of the mechanical resonator .    in this paper",
    "we solve the dynamics of the cavity and the mechanical resonator in the presence of the cross - kerr and the radiation pressure coupling .",
    "we determine the effects of the cross - kerr coupling on the red and blue sidebands within a mean field approach .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the sideband peak is shifted due to the cross - kerr coupling .",
    "in addition , the cross - kerr coupling induces a nonmonotonuous response of the effective mechanical damping as a function of the number of photons pumped into the cavity .     and a cross - kerr coupling @xmath2 .",

    "the first line of eq",
    ".   describes exchange processes between the resonator and the cavity while the second line gives a frequency shift of the cavity which is proportional to the average displacement of the resonator .",
