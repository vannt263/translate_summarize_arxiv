    "a problem which one frequently encounters in applications is to find an average for a finite set of sample points @xmath1 belonging to a manifold @xmath2 .",
    "a method to solve this problem is to write it as an optimization problem , more precisely to construct a cost function @xmath3 associated with this set of sample points and then the average is defined by @xmath4 of special interest are the cost functions of least square type @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a distance function on @xmath2 .",
    "the average of the set of sample points @xmath1 on the manifold @xmath2 is the set defined by @xmath7 when the function @xmath8 is differentiable , this is equivalent with solving the equation @xmath9 and with testing for which solutions the minimum value is attained . in order to write this equation",
    "we need the knowledge of a local system of coordinates on the manifold @xmath2 , a requirement that might be difficult to fulfill in many practical cases .",
    "another problem that we may encounter with this approach is that the set of sample points @xmath10 might not be entirely included in the domain of a single local system of coordinates .",
    "one way to overcome these difficulties is to lift the problem on a simpler manifold @xmath11 .",

    "the set equality @xmath15 shows that it is sufficient to solve the equation @xmath16 on the simpler manifold @xmath11 and project these solutions on the manifold @xmath2 .    a way to solve",
    "this new problem is to endow @xmath11 with a riemannian metric @xmath17 and compute the critical points of the gradient vector field @xmath18 and verify which one of them are local / global minima .",
    "we note that if @xmath19 is a critical point of the vector field @xmath20 , then it is a critical point of the vector field @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is any other riemannian metric on @xmath11 .",
    "although the manifold @xmath11 might have a simpler geometrical structure then the initial manifold @xmath2 , we still need a local system of coordinates or the knowledge of covariant derivatives on the manifold @xmath11 in order to be able to compute the critical points of the function @xmath23 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . to further avoid the use of riemannian geometry of the manifold @xmath11 we will embed @xmath11 in a larger space @xmath24 .    in the current paper",
    "we propose a solution for finding the critical points of the lifted cost function @xmath23 by constructing a vector field @xmath25 on the ambient space @xmath24 ( usually an euclidean space ) , that is tangent to the submanifold @xmath11 and by also constructing a riemannian metric @xmath17 on @xmath11 such that @xmath26 .",

    "we will propose a different algorithm in order to deal with averaging problems on general differentiable manifolds .",
