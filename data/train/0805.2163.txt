    "this paper is motivated by combinatorial questions that arise in statistical physics . to deal with the problems we use a discrete version of morse theory and algebraic topology .",
    "this short introduction to certain supersymmetric lattice models follows the work of de boer , van eerten , fendley , and schoutens @xcite closely and we refer to them for the big picture .",
    "a lattice is a graph , and vertices can be occupied by certain elementary particles called fermions .",
    "but two fermions are not allowed to occupy adjacent vertices . the witten index @xmath4 for the hamiltonian @xmath5 turns out to be independent of @xmath6 , and in the limit @xmath7 it is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of ways @xmath10 fermions can be distributed on the lattice .",
    "as exemplified in @xcite , if the lattice is a cube then @xmath11 . the witten index is used to estimate the number of ground states of a system .",
    "there is a beautiful connection between combinatorial topology and physics first used by jonsson @xcite to prove two conjectures from @xcite and later explored by bousquet - mlou , linusson , and nevo @xcite . for a simplicial complex with @xmath9 faces of dimension @xmath12",
    "the reduced euler characteristic is @xmath13 which is @xmath14 .",
    "the simplicial complex of allowed fermion configurations on a graph is usually called the independence complex of the graph , and our main result , theorem  [ theorem : main ] , is a tool for bounding expressions like the reduced euler characteristic ( and hence the witten index ) . in section  [ sec : bounds ] we apply our estimation technique on lattice types for which van eerten @xcite approximated the witten index using transfer matrices that could be computer treated .    in the last section we generalize the cohomological method and the 3-rule of fendley , halverson , huijse , and schoutens @xcite .",
    "we present lattices of any dimension that satisfy the generalized 3-rule and give good lower bounds on their number of ground states .",
    "we will use @xmath15 to denote the set of all subsets of @xmath16 .",
    "an _ abstract simplicial complex _",
    "@xmath17 with vertex set @xmath18 is a subset of @xmath19 satisfying @xmath20 we will often patch together simplicial complexes combinatorially and in that case it is useful to allow @xmath21 .",
    "all graphs and simplicial complexes in this paper are finite .",
    "the _ face poset _",
    "@xmath22 is the set of elements of a simplicial complex @xmath17 partially ordered by inclusion .",
    "note that if @xmath17 is nonempty , then @xmath23 is the least element of @xmath22 .",
    "we warn the reader that the empty set is usually not included in the face poset , but it will make life much easier when we merge posets . given a subset @xmath24 of @xmath18 , the _ induced subcomplex _ of @xmath17 on @xmath24 is @xmath25=\\{\\sigma\\in\\sigma | \\sigma\\subseteq l\\}$ ] , and the _ link _ @xmath26 is the subcomplex @xmath27 of @xmath17 with vertex set @xmath28 . for _ induced subgraphs _ we use the same notation as for induced subcomplexes .",
    "in this section we review necessary facts regarding discrete morse theory and independence complexes , and prove some useful lemmas and propositions .",
    "the topological objects that we most often consider are simplicial complexes , but sometimes well - behaved finite cw - complexes pop up . for the definition of cw - complexes and basic facts of combinatorial topology , @xcite and @xcite are recommended .",
    "discrete morse theory is a method for reducing the number of cells of a cw - complex without changing its homotopy type .",
    "it was invented by forman @xcite who used the concept of discrete morse functions . in the last years these functions",
    "have mostly been used only implicitly , and instead one constructs acyclic matchings on hasse diagrams of face posets . in chapter 4 of jonsson s book `` simplicial complexes of graphs '' , @xcite , the state of art of discrete morse theory is surveyed .",
    "our method of applying the theory has a lot in common with the philosophy behind bousquet - mlou , linusson , and nevo s paper @xcite .",
    "the _ hasse diagram _ of a poset @xmath29 is a directed graph with vertex set @xmath29 and an arc @xmath30 for each pair @xmath31 such that there does not exist a @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 .",
    "the element @xmath34 _ covers _",
    "@xmath35 in @xmath29 if @xmath30 in the hasse diagram .",
    "an _ acyclic matching _ on @xmath29 is a set @xmath36 of pairs of elements from @xmath29 satisfying three conditions :    * two elements can only form a pair if one of them covers the other one .",
    "* no element of the poset is in more than one pair of @xmath36 . *",
    "if for each pair @xmath30 of @xmath36 we change the direction of the arcs to @xmath37 , then the hasse diagram is still acylic .",
    "we construct acyclic matchings on face posets , and the elements left in a poset after the removal of all matched cells of an acyclic matching are called the _ critical cells . _ removing the cells of an acyclic matching @xmath36 from a complex @xmath17 is a recurring operation and we will use the sloppy notation @xmath38 to denoted the critical cells . in the definition of the face poset of a simplicial complex we included the empty set , if we had not done that , one of the vertices would be a critical cell .",
    "the difference in the definitions corresponds to working with either reduced @xmath39 or unreduced @xmath40 homology .",
    "the simplical version of the main theorem of discrete morse theory states that if @xmath17 is a simplicial complex and @xmath36 is an acyclic matching on @xmath22 then there is a cw - complex @xmath41 with @xmath38 as cells ( but with perhaps other gluing maps ) which is homotopy equivalent to @xmath17 .",
    "if no cell in the acyclic matching is covered by a critical cell then @xmath41 is a simplicial complex and the homotopy equivalence is a deformation retraction .",
    "a homological corollary from this is that if we have an acyclic matching @xmath36 on @xmath22 , then as vector spaces @xmath42    the following cluster lemma will be used to patch together acyclic matchings .",

    "an often used fact is that if @xmath52 is an isolated vertex of @xmath0 , then one obtains a complete acyclic matching on @xmath53 by matching each @xmath54 which does not contain @xmath52 with @xmath55 .",

    "when @xmath51 is isomorphic to a wedge of spheres of the same dimension then the number of ground states is the number of spheres .",
