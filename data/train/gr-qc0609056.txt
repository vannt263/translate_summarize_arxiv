    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify certain aspects of the physical interpretation of the vacuum space - time that was referred to as the @xmath0-metric in the classic review of ehlers and kundt  @xcite  a label that has been widely used ever since .",
    "in fact , the static form of this solution was originally found by weyl in 1917  @xcite and subsequently rediscovered many times .",
    "its basic properties were first interpreted by kinnersley and walker  @xcite ( see also bonnor  @xcite ) , who showed that its analytic extension represents a pair of black holes which accelerate away from each other due to the presence of strings or struts that are represented by conical singularities .",
    "the radiative properties of this space - time were investigated by farhoosh and zimmerman  @xcite and by bik  @xcite , and its asymptotic properties by ashtekar and dray  @xcite . for reviews of more recent",
    "work see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the line element for the @xmath0-metric has been expressed using many different coordinate systems , it is appropriate to initially quote it in the well known form @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are cubic functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively : @xmath6 this solution contains two constant parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it reduces to a form of minkowski space when @xmath9 , but has no convenient limit as @xmath10 .",
    "it will be shown below that it is only after certain rescalings that these parameters acquire specific physical interpretations .",
    "it may be observed that the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are related by the condition that @xmath13 .",
    "it follows that these functions must have the same structural properties such as the same number of ( related ) roots .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 and @xmath3 will each possess three distinct real roots if @xmath14 , and we will assume that this condition is satisfied .",
    "it may also be noted that , in the form ( [ pdcmetric ] ) with ( [ pdpq ] ) , the coordinate freedom to make a linear transformation in @xmath4 and @xmath5 has been used to remove the linear terms in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "although the metric ( [ pdcmetric ] ) has been extensively used in the literature , a significant simplification was recently introduced by hong and teo @xcite .",
    "their innovation was to use the freedom to apply a linear transformation to the coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 , not to remove the linear components in the cubic functions as in ( [ pdpq ] ) but , rather , to use the transformation ( together with a rescaling of @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) in such a way that the root structure of the cubics is expressed in a very simple form .",
    "specifically , assuming the existence of three roots with the coefficient of the cubic term being negative , transformations are applied to fix the roots of the metric function in @xmath17 at @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in order to preserve the order of the roots , it is necessary to assume that @xmath21 . in this way ,",
    "hong and teo have re - expressed the line element ( [ pdcmetric ] ) in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23    to maintain a lorentzian signature of the metric ( [ htcmetric ] ) , it is necessary that @xmath24 , which implies that the coordinate @xmath17 must be constrained to lie between appropriate roots of the cubic function @xmath25 . on the other hand , there is no constraint on the sign of @xmath26 ( static regions occur when @xmath27 )",
    ". it can also be seen from ( [ htcmetric ] ) that @xmath28 corresponds to conformal infinity .",
    "thus a physical space - time must satisfy either @xmath29 or @xmath30 . with these constraints on the coordinates @xmath31 , the metric ( [ htcmetric ] ) can still describe four qualitatively different space - times depending on particular choices of the coordinate ranges .",
    "we will here restrict attention to the physically most important case @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in which the metric describes the space - time of two accelerated black holes .    in the form of the metric  ( [ htcmetric ] ) , the roots of @xmath25 and @xmath26 have very simple explicit expressions , while still satisfying the condition that @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , their simplified root structure is of considerable assistance when it comes to performing calculations , and also helps in the physical interpretation of this solution .",
    "however , particularly for convenience near the black holes , closely related spherical - like coordinates will be introduced in section  [ sc : sphcoords ] . in",
    "either of these forms , the simple factor structure of the metric functions enables kruskal  szekeres - type transformations to be performed .",
    "these are given explicitly for the first time in section  [ sc : horizons ] and clarify the extensions through the horizons .",
    "they also enable conformal penrose diagrams to be constructed .",
    "after first discussing the weak field limit in sections  [ sc : weakfield ] and  [ sc : glstrwfl ] , these two - dimensional diagrams are combined in section  [ sc : glstr ] to form a three - dimensional picture which nicely represents the global causal structure of the regions outside the black hole horizons .",
    "some particular invariant physical and geometrical quantities are reviewed in section  [ sc : physprop ] .",
    "finally , explicit relations to other familiar coordinate systems are presented in sections  [ sc : boostrot ] and  [ sc : tphconst ] , further demonstrating the advantages of the simplified root structure of the new metric functions .",
    "although the @xmath35 coordinates of ( [ htcmetric ] ) and ( [ htpq ] ) are useful when performing calculations and in analysing the global structure the space - time , their physical interpretation can be made more clear if we introduce closely related coordinates @xmath36 which will play a role of spherical coordinates around the black holes . since we restricted @xmath17 to the range @xmath37 ,",
    "it is natural to introduce the coordinate transformation @xmath38 where @xmath39 . with ( [ xytothetar ] ) ,",
    "the metric becomes @xmath40 as in the nonrotating and uncharged case of that described in @xcite , where @xmath41 it can clearly be seen that this represents a family of solutions with two parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 which ( in contrast to the metric ( [ htcmetric ] ) ) has the important property that it reduces precisely to the familiar form of the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution when @xmath44 .",
    "relative to a null tetrad that is naturally adapted to ( [ blcmetric ] ) , it can be shown that the only nonzero component of the curvature tensor is that given by @xmath45 this implies that the space - time is of algebraic type  d and that ( except for the case when @xmath46 which is flat ) a _ curvature singularity _ occurs at @xmath47 .",
    "notice also that the space - time becomes flat for @xmath48 , i.e. , near conformal infinity .",
    "the roots of @xmath49 at @xmath50 and @xmath51 are coordinate singularities which correspond to killing horizons .",
    "since this solution is a one - parameter generalization of the schwarzschild space - time , it is natural to continue to interpret the constant @xmath42 ( which we assume to be positive ) as the parameter characterizing the mass of the source , and @xmath52 as a schwarzschild - like radial coordinate with a _ black hole horizon _ @xmath53 at @xmath50 .",
    "the remaining question therefore concerns the character of the new parameter  @xmath43 ( which must also now be positive ) and the horizon  @xmath54 at @xmath51 .",
    "we will argue that this solution describes an accelerating black hole in which @xmath43 can be interpreted as the acceleration .",
    "several reasons for this interpretation will be given .",
    "the first is that the horizon at @xmath51 has the character of an _ acceleration horizon _ associated with a boost symmetry .",
    "it will also be shown in the section  [ sc : weakfield ] that @xmath43 is exactly the acceleration of the corresponding source in the weak field limit .",
    "the relation between the @xmath55 and @xmath35 coordinates , the roots of @xmath49 , and the constraint representing conformal infinity are illustrated in figure  [ pdcoords ] .",
    "as indicated , the horizons divide the space - time into three distinct domains labelled i , ii , and iii . in the domain ii , the killing vector @xmath56 is timelike and the space - time static .",
    "the coordinate @xmath57 is temporal here , while @xmath58 is spatial . in domains",
    "i and iii , the character of the coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath58 is interchanged .",
    "-coordinates are indicated together with the roots of the cubic functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 given by ( [ htpq ] ) .",
    "the diagonal @xmath28 corresponds to conformal infinity  @xmath62 .",
    "the shaded region represents the part of the space - time that has most physical significance and is discussed here . in the @xmath55-coordinates , @xmath63 and",
    "@xmath64 correspond to coordinate poles . for @xmath65  const .",
    ", @xmath66 increases from zero at the singularity through the black hole horizon  @xmath53 and the acceleration horizon  @xmath54 and then either to conformal infinity or to the coordinate limit @xmath67 , through which the space - time can be extended . ]",
    "the @xmath68-metric space - time also admits a second killing vector @xmath69 which is always spatial and corresponds to the rotational symmetry . it can be seen from the metric ( [ blcmetric ] ) that the roots of the metric coefficient @xmath70 , where the norm of the killing vector @xmath71 vanishes , correspond to poles @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the coordinate @xmath72 .",
    "these identify the _ axis of symmetry _ of the space - time .",
    "the coordinate @xmath73 is thus taken to be periodic with the range @xmath74 , where the precise value of the positive parameter @xmath68 will be discussed below in section [ sc : physprop ] .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath75 corresponds to conformal infinity and we assume that @xmath76 ( see the shaded region illustrated in figure  [ pdcoords ] ) .",
    "however , in our spherical - type coordinates , the region near conformal infinity is problematic . for , conformal infinity",
    "is simply given by @xmath77 , and we take . for @xmath78 , conformal infinity",
    "is not reached even for @xmath79 . to fully cover this asymptotic region of the space - time ,",
    "it is better to revert to the @xmath35-coordinates .",
    "the irregularity of the coordinate @xmath58 on the horizons can be seen from the fact that the metric ( [ blcmetric ] ) is singular at @xmath51 and at @xmath50 .",
    "however , these are merely coordinate singularities and can be removed by suitable coordinate transformations .",
    "it turns out that the complete space - time manifold consists of ( infinitely ) many distinct domains of types i , ii , or iii which are connected at the horizons .",
    "the continuity of the manifold across each horizon can be explicitly demonstrated by introducing suitable coordinates .",
    "this can be achieved by first introducing the double null coordinates @xmath80 keeping @xmath72 and @xmath81 unchanged , where @xmath82 is a tortoise coordinate satisfying @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 where @xmath85 the null coordinates @xmath86 take infinite values at each horizon . to analyse the behaviour near each horizon",
    ", we therefore make the rescaling @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are appropriately chosen integers and @xmath90 or @xmath91 near the acceleration or black hole horizons respectively .",
    "we can then introduce kruskal  szekeres - type coordinates @xmath92 at each horizon where @xmath93    first , let us consider the space - time _ near the acceleration horizon _  @xmath54 at @xmath51 and put @xmath90 .",
    "we start with the asymptotic time - dependent domain i with integers @xmath94 , and add the subscript `` @xmath95 '' to the coordinates @xmath96 and @xmath97 . here",
    "@xmath98 and @xmath99 take positive values with @xmath100 or @xmath101 at the acceleration horizon .",
    "we can then extend the coordinates across the horizon to _ two _ static regions with negative values of @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "these correspond to two domains of type ii with @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which can subsequently be extended to another domain of type i with @xmath98 and @xmath99 both negative and @xmath104 . in the domains of type  i ,",
    "the kruskal  szekeres - type coordinates are explicitly given by @xmath105    \\displaystyle   { { r_{\\mathrm{a}}}}= ( -1)^j \\frac{|1-\\alpha r|^{\\frac12 } }   { ( 1+\\alpha r)^{\\frac{1 - 2\\alpha m}{2(1 + 2\\alpha m ) } }    \\left|1-\\frac r{2m}\\right|^{\\frac{2\\alpha m}{1 + 2\\alpha m } } }         \\;\\sinh\\bigl((1 - 2\\alpha m)\\,\\alpha t\\bigr)\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ] in the two domains of type  ii , the corresponding expressions are identical except that the @xmath106 and @xmath107 terms are interchanged .",
    "after this transformation , the 2-space on which @xmath108 and @xmath109 are constant has the metric @xmath110 of course , @xmath66 must now be expressed in terms of @xmath111 and @xmath112 and this is smooth at for the above specific choice of the constant @xmath113 .",
    "the metric is thus regular at the acceleration horizon , which now corresponds to the two lines @xmath114 .",
    "we have thus extended the metric across the acceleration horizon and shown that the space - time contains not only one static domain of type  ii ( which corresponds to the exterior of a black hole ) , but _ two _ distinct static domains that are causally separated by the acceleration horizon @xmath54 , and also a second ( prior ) non - static domain of type  i.    notice , however , that the range of the coordinates @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the domains  i is restricted by the presence of conformal infinity . to cover this region fully ,",
    "it is better to revert to the coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath117 using ( [ xytothetar ] ) in which conformal infinity is given by @xmath118 , as this also permits @xmath117 to be negative .",
    "( considering only positive values of @xmath66 , @xmath62 is not reached for @xmath119 . ) from the definitions ( [ uvdef])([uvuvtransf ] ) we see that this gives an upper limit ( which depends on the value of @xmath72 ) on the product @xmath120 .",
    "we may similarly consider the space - time _ near the black hole horizon _",
    "@xmath53 at @xmath50 , where we choose @xmath91 so that @xmath121 or @xmath122 on the horizon .",
    "we now start with the static region of type  ii with @xmath123 . by allowing @xmath124",
    ", we attach to it two other time - dependent domains of type  iii ( interior of the black and white holes ) with @xmath125 , and an additional static domain of type  ii with @xmath126 .",
    "the kruskal  szekeres - type coordinates ( [ kruskcoor ] ) in the domains of type ii are @xmath127    \\displaystyle   { { r_{\\mathrm{o}}}}= + ( -1)^i\\frac{\\left|1-\\frac r{2m}\\right|^\\frac12\\ ,   ( 1+\\alpha r)^{\\frac{1 - 2\\alpha m}{8\\alpha m } } }   { ( 1-\\alpha r)^{\\frac{1 + 2\\alpha m}{8\\alpha m } } }         \\;{\\textstyle\\cosh\\bigl(\\frac{(1 - 4\\alpha^2 m^2)}{4m}\\ , t\\bigr)}\\ ; , \\end{array}\\ ] ] and",
    "again the expressions for the domains of type iii have identical forms with the @xmath106 and @xmath107 terms interchanged . in this case , the 2-space on which @xmath108 and @xmath109 are constant has the metric @xmath128 this is clearly continuous at @xmath50 and is the analogue of the kruskal  szekeres coordinates for the schwarzschild black hole ( to which it reduces in the limit @xmath129 ) .",
    "in fact , the metric is smooth in these coordinates at @xmath130 , and we have thus obtained the extension of the metric across  @xmath53 . the domain covered by @xmath131 contains two static regions representing two black hole exteriors that are connected through the einstein ",
    "rosen bridge .",
    "the two domains of type  iii correspond to the interiors of the black hole and the complementary white hole .",
    "notice in this case that the curvature singularity at @xmath132 in domains of type iii is given by the condition @xmath133 .    in the same way",
    ", we can go across the horizon of the other black hole using another set of coordinates @xmath134 covering domains @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "this process can be repeated across any subsequent horizon and we can thus continue the space - time into a maximally extended manifold which contains an infinite sequence of domains .",
    "the sequence of coordinates @xmath137 and @xmath134 each cover smoothly one horizon and four adjacent blocks of the initial @xmath138-coordinates around it .",
    "the integers @xmath139 which label the different domains ( see figure  [ fig : cmtrcd ] ) satisfy the constraint @xmath140 .",
    "+    globally _ compactified _ coordinates @xmath141 which cover the whole space - time can be introduced by the definition @xmath142    \\displaystyle\\tan\\frac{{\\tilde v}}2    = ( -{\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}\\k)\\;\\ , v^{-{\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}\\k }    = ( -1)^j\\,\\exp\\bigl(\\frac{\\alpha v}{2|\\k|}\\bigr)\\ ; ,    \\qquad{{\\tilde v}}\\in\\big(j\\pi,(j+1)\\pi\\big)\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ] again , with the choices @xmath90 or @xmath91 , the metric is smooth across the acceleration or black hole horizons respectively . on the horizons either of the coordinates @xmath143 or @xmath144 are integer multiples of @xmath145 .",
    "different domains of the coordinates @xmath138 thus corresponds to different blocks of the coordinates @xmath146 separated by horizons @xmath54 and @xmath53 , which are naturally labeled by two integers @xmath147 . the whole space - time is covered by @xmath148 , constrained by conditions at conformal infinity and the singularity .",
    "this is illustrated in the two - dimensional conformal diagrams given in figure  [ fig : cmtrcd ] .",
    "finally , recall that the extension across the horizons and the compactification into two - dimensional conformal diagrams were obtained by transforming the coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath58 only : the angular coordinates @xmath72 and @xmath81 remained unchanged .",
    "however , the exact form of the conformal diagrams  particularly , the location of  @xmath62  depends on the value of the coordinate  @xmath72 .",
    "for general @xmath72 , the location of conformal infinity in the two - dimensional conformal diagram is given by a spacelike line as typically shown in figure  [ fig : cmtrcd](a ) .",
    "it is not clear _ a  priori _ why conformal infinity is not manifestly null as one would expect for a vacuum solution of the einstein equations without a cosmological constant .",
    "it may also be recalled that the coordinates @xmath55 do not reach as far as @xmath62 for @xmath149 . for this range ,",
    "it is preferable to revert to the @xmath35-coordinates  ( [ xytothetar ] ) . with this , conformal infinity on the inner axes @xmath150 ( @xmath151 )",
    "is seen to be null as shown in figure  [ fig : cmtrcd](b ) . however , this axis is generally singular as will be discussed below .",
    "in addition , on the outer axis , @xmath152 , conformal infinity `` coincides '' with the horizon at @xmath51 as shown in figure  [ fig : cmtrcd](c ) , but this axis also generally corresponds to a topological singularity . these questions will be thoroughly discussed in the following sections .",
    "the @xmath0-metric in either of the forms ( [ htcmetric ] ) or ( [ blcmetric ] ) is expressed in terms of _ three _ positive real parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( satisfying @xmath153 ) and @xmath68 ( which is hidden in the range of the coordinate @xmath74 ) .",
    "the basic interpretation of this solution is well know .",
    "the purpose of this section is to identify certain invariant geometrical and physical quantities and to express them in terms of these new parameters .",
    "let us start by examining the regularity of the axis of symmetry .",
    "for this , we consider a small circle around the half - axis @xmath63 ( with @xmath154 const ) . for the above range of @xmath109",
    ", we obtain @xmath155 in general , it is not exactly @xmath156 , which implies the existence of a conical singularity .",
    "similarly , around the other half axis @xmath64 , @xmath157 which implies the existence of a conical singularity with a _ different _ conicity ( unless @xmath158 )",
    ". the deficit or excess angles of either of these two conical singularities can be removed by an appropriate choice of the constant  @xmath68 , but not both simultaneously . in general",
    ", the constant  @xmath0 can thus be seen to determine the ballance between the deficit / excess angles on the two halves of the axis . in particular ,",
    "one natural choice is to remove the conical singularity at @xmath63 by setting @xmath159 . in this case",
    ", the deficit angles at the poles @xmath160 are respectively @xmath161 as first given by kinnersley and walker @xcite , a typical surface on which @xmath57 and @xmath66 are constant can be illustrated as in figure  [ tearfig ] as a surface embedded in an artificial euclidian space in such a way that it has the correct inner geometry induced by the metric . however , this is not the correct embedding in the real curved space - time as the coordinates @xmath57 , @xmath66 , @xmath108 , @xmath73 of the @xmath0-metric ( [ blcmetric ] ) are orthogonal , so in the real space - time there is no sharp vertex .",
    "and @xmath66 illustrated as an embedding into e@xmath162 .",
    "this is regular at @xmath63 , but there is a conical singularity at @xmath64 corresponding to the deficit angle @xmath163 . ]",
    "the conical singularity with constant deficit angle along the half axis can be interpreted as representing a _ semi - infinite cosmic string _ under tension .",
    "this extends from the source at @xmath47 right out to conformal infinity .",
    "this naturally leads to the interpretation that the metric ( [ blcmetric ] ) represents a schwarzschild - like black hole that is being accelerated along the axis @xmath64 by the action of a force which corresponds to the tension in a cosmic string .",
    "it is often assumed that the range of the rotational coordinate is @xmath156 .",
    "this can be achieved by the simple rescaling @xmath164 where @xmath165 . for the above natural choice , where a cosmic string occurs only along the @xmath152 axis",
    ", the line element takes the form @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath49 are still given by ( [ blpq ] ) .",
    "the remaining metric parameters @xmath168 and @xmath169 depend on the ` gauge fixing ' of the form of the @xmath68-metric .",
    "rescaling coordinates can modify its form and lead to a different set of metric parameters .",
    "it is therefore useful to relate the parameters to invariant geometrical quantities .",
    "here we list some of the physically most interesting ones .",

    "an invariant quantity is thus given by the ratio of the surface gravity on the black hole and acceleration horizons .",
    "these are given by @xmath174 which are respectively related to the hawking and unruh temperatures of the black hole and accelerating frame .",
    "it may also be observed that @xmath175 which , according to @xcite , implies that the mass of the black holes is given precisely by  @xmath176 .",
    "notice also that the ratio @xmath177 determines the quantity @xmath178 , which can be understood as the force per unit angle @xmath81 acting on the holes .",
    "indeed , it corresponds to a difference per unit angle in the tensions of the cosmic strings on the two parts of the axis , cf .",
    "( [ con0 ] ) and  ( [ conpi ] ) .",
