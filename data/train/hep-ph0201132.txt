    "in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , there exist quadratically divergent contributions to the corrections to the higgs boson mass .",
    "this is the so - called naturalness problem of the sm .",
    "a good way to solve this problem is to consider supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm .",
    "then the quadratic divergences can be cancelled by loop diagrams involving the supersymmetric partners of the sm particles exactly .",
    "the most attractive supersymmetric extension of the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite . in the mssm , we need two higgs doublets @xmath8 and @xmath9 to give masses to up and down type fermions and to assure the cancellation of anomalies .",
    "the higgs spectrum consists of three neutral higgs bosons : one @xmath0-odd particle ( @xmath10 ) , two @xmath0-even particles ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , and a charged higgs boson ( @xmath13 ) . at the tree level ,",
    "the neutral higgs boson masses are determined by two input parameters ( see eq.([relation of the mass parameters ] ) ) . in this paper",

    "the radiative corrections to the higgs boson masses have been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the corrections to @xmath19 and @xmath14 are less than @xmath20 with our parameter choice , therefore they will not be considered in our calculation .",
    "the neutral higgs boson decays can be divided into two types of decay modes , i.e. the sm decay modes and the susy decay modes .",
    "the first type of decay modes ( e.g. @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) have been already carefully discussed , especially in the parameter space with large susy particle masses where the higgs boson decays into sparticles are kinematically forbidden @xcite .",
    "but for the second type of decay modes , it has been found that the decays of the mssm higgs bosons into charginos or neutralinos may have substantial branching fractions when kinematically allowed , and can sometimes even dominate the usual sm decay modes @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , the one - loop calculation of the higgs decay into the lightest neutralino pair @xmath26 is important for the dark matter search@xcite .",
