    "the pound - drever - hall technique is commonly used to frequency stabilize lasers to optical cavity resonances .",
    "it was originally developed by pound@xcite for the frequency stabilization of microwave oscillators , and adapted to the optical domain by drever and hall and others.@xcite in brief , the source to be stabilized is frequency modulated . a diode detector ( a photodiode in the optical domain ) detects the reflection of the modulated source from a cavity .",
    "if the source is slightly detuned from a resonance , the diode detector signal will contain a component at the modulation frequency .",
    "when the source is on resonance , no component is observed at the modulation frequency . by mixing the diode signal with the modulation source ,",
    "we can obtain a suitable error signal for feedback control of the oscillator frequency ( zero on resonance , positive on one side and negative on the other ) .",
    "high bandwidth and a large capture range have made this technique popular for laser frequency stabilization in research laboratories .",
    "the technique is now rarely used for the stabilization of lower - frequency ( microwave ) oscillators , where a variety of alternative techniques exist .",
    "black@xcite has written a pedagogical article on the basic theory of the pound - drever - hall technique and an undergraduate experiment has been developed by boyd _",
    "et al._@xcite to demonstrate laser frequency stabilization using the technique .",
    "a detailed guide to its implementation in a research context is available in ref .  .",
    "the availability of inexpensive modular radio - frequency ( rf ) components has allowed us to develop a senior undergraduate experiment which is similar in spirit to the optical implementation of pound - drever - hall , but which uses rf electronics rather than optical equipment .",
    "the three main pieces of equipment are a commercial voltage controlled oscillator , a resonating cavity , and an integrating control circuit .",
    "the essence of the pound - drever - hall technique is the phase change in the cavity reflection coefficient as the frequency passes through a resonance .",
    "with rf electronics it is straightforward to directly observe this phase shift using an unmodulated source .",
    "this observation is the basis of the interferometric cavity locking techniques sometimes applied in the microwave regime.@xcite by directly observing the phase shift ( which is difficult in the optical domain due to the short wavelengths ) , the basis of the pound - drever - hall technique is reinforced .",
    "radio frequency electronics also provide a systematic way to vary the extent of source modulation and the cavity coupling .",
    "the experiment begins by observing the relation between the input voltage and the output frequency , which is known as the tuning curve of the voltage controlled oscillator .",
    "the cavity resonance is then observed by scanning the frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator and measuring the power reflected from the cavity .",
    "different coupling conditions can also be tested at this time .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the reflection coefficient are investigated by mixing the reflected signal with a phase - shifted portion of the original signal to create a dispersion - like error signal which can be used to frequency stabilize the voltage controlled oscillator .",
    "the modulation properties of the voltage controlled oscillator are then investigated , and the relation between the modulation voltage , the tuning curve , and the strength of the frequency sidebands is confirmed . once the modulation is understood quantitatively ,",
    "the pound - drever - hall technique is implemented , and plots of the error signal as a function of the detuning of the oscillator from the cavity resonance are obtained .    in the final step the voltage",
    "controlled oscillator is frequency stabilized using the pound - drever - hall error signal .",
    "locking can be verified by changing the temperature of the cavity and recording the stabilized frequency change using a frequency counter .",
    "the relation between the frequency and temperature can be used to determine the linear thermal expansion coefficient of copper . by changing the inner conductor it is also possible to measure the expansion coefficients of aluminum and super invar . in the following sections we explain these aspects of this experiment in more detail .",
    "the resonating cavity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] consists of a @xmath1 length coaxial transmission - line of @xmath2 characteristic impedance , with one ended shorted and the other open - circuited .",
    "although we refer to it as a `` cavity , '' the current node end is left open allowing both visual inspection and the inner cylinder to be easily changed .",
    "the length of the inner cylinder is one quarter of the desired resonant wavelength corresponding to @xmath0 .",
    "the resonant frequency is dictated by the availability of a suitable voltage controlled oscillator and cavity dimensions which are convenient for handling and inspection by students .",
    "the coaxial cavity type was chosen because it is similar to familiar resonating systems , such as transverse waves on strings .",
    "this configuration also allows us to observe the thermal expansion of the inner conductor because the resonant frequency is primarily determined by the length of the inner cylinder .",
    "the inner cylinder can also be changed to observe the thermal expansion of different materials .",
    "two holes for coupling loops are drilled in the cavity lid midway between the inner cylinder and the edge of the outer cylinder .",
    "the loops consist of 26 awg copper wire attached to sma connectors by soldering one end to the center pin and the other to ground .",
    "the sma connectors are inserted into brass cartridges which fit into the holes in the lid ( voltage node ) .",
    "the cartridges are labeled so that the angle of rotation can be read .",
    "the two loops are approximately @xmath3 and @xmath4 in area .",
    "the larger loop is used to couple power into the cavity , and the smaller loop is used to detect power from the cavity .",
    "the size of the large loop is dictated by the requirement that under , critical , and over coupling be observable by rotating the loop cartridge .",
    "the other loop is small to reduce its impact on the quality factor .",

    "we have constructed a similar cavity for research purposes@xcite with a single threaded hole for an sma - based coupling loop and have verified that the discrepancy is primarily due to the brass cartridges .",
    "however , the large , easily adjustable coupling loops , and the relatively small @xmath7 are advantageous for this experiment .",
    "the experiment is based on a voltage controlled oscillator ( minicircuits , zx95 - 850-s+ ) which has a central frequency which approximately matches the resonant frequency of the cavity ( @xmath8 ) and a modulation bandwidth much greater than the pound - drever - hall modulation frequency ( @xmath9 ) . to observe the cavity resonance , a ramp function",
    "is applied to the tuning port of the voltage controlled oscillator while the output is connected to the large coupling loop through an isolator and then circulator . the signal that reflects from the cavity exits the circulator and",
    "is amplified before entering a detector diode followed by a 5k@xmath10 resistor in parallel to ground .",
    "the diode voltage is observed using an oscilloscope .",
    "the detector diode voltage to power relation was measured and is provided to the students .",
    "this relation depends on the load that the diode is driving .",
    "a 5k@xmath10 parallel load resistor is used to ensure that the load is consistent between different oscilloscopes .",
    "the students are asked to explore over , under , and critical coupling by varying the angle of the input coupling loops , with critical coupling being characterized as having the smallest reflected power on resonance .",
    "once critical coupling is found and the loops are secured in this position , the reflected signal is analyzed to find the loaded quality factor , @xmath11 , of the cavity ( see fig .",

    "although the equivalence of the lumped circuit model can be established under quite general conditions,@xcite a heuristic motivation specific to our situation will be given here .",
    "near resonance , the voltage node end of a @xmath1 coaxial resonator behaves like a series lcr resonant circuit  a large amount of current flows for a small oscillating voltage applied between the inner and outer conductors .",

    "<S> we have developed a senior undergraduate experiment that illustrates frequency stabilization techniques using radio - frequency electronics . </S>",
    "<S> the primary objective is to frequency stabilize a voltage controlled oscillator to a cavity resonance at @xmath0 using the pound - drever - hall method . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is commonly applied to stabilize lasers at optical frequencies . by using only radio - frequency equipment it is possible to systematically study aspects of the technique more thoroughly , inexpensively , and free from eye hazards . </S>",
    "<S> students also learn about modular radio - frequency electronics and basic feedback control loops . by varying the temperature of the resonator </S>",
    "<S> , students can determine the thermal expansion coefficients of copper , aluminum , and super invar . </S>"
