    "the integrated colours of elliptical galaxies become progressively bluer towards fainter magnitudes ( faber 1973 , 1977 ; visvanathan & sandage 1977 ; frogel et al . 1978 ; persson , frogel , & aaronson 1979 ; bower , lucey , & ellis 1992a ; 1992b ) . with an accurate photometry of a large sample of elliptical galaxies in virgo and coma clusters of galaxies , bower et al . ( 1992a , b ) have shown that the colour - magnitude ( cm ) relations of two clusters are identical within observational uncertainties , suggesting that the cm relation is universal for cluster ellipticals .",
    "the rms scatter about the mean cm relation is typically @xmath4 mag , a comparable size to observational errors , and implies a virtually negligible intrinsic scatter . if the scatter is due to age dispersion among cluster ellipticals , the photometric data by bower et al .",
    "( 1992a , b ) suggest that cluster ellipticals are unlikely to have formed below a redshift of 2 ( @xmath5 ) , which sets an upper limit of @xmath6 gyrs for the age dispersion of the bulk stellar populations of cluster ellipticals . an identical upper limit to the age dispersion of such galaxies is also suggested by their small dispersion about the so - called fundamental plane ( renzini & ciotti 1993 ) .",
    "these findings are in excellent agreement with a scenario for the formation of elliptical galaxies dominated by protogalactic collapse and dissipational star formation early in the evolution of the universe ( larson 1974 ; saito 1979a , b ; arimoto & yoshii 1986 , 1987 , hereafter ay87 ; matteucci & tornamb 1987 ; yoshii & arimoto 1987 ; bressan , chiosi , & fagotto , 1994 ; tantalo et al .",
    "the cm relation itself is also quite naturally established in collapse / wind model of galaxy formation ; a galactic wind is induced progressively later in more massive galaxies owing to deeper potential and stellar populations in brighter galaxies are much more enhanced in heavy elements and as a result redder in colours .",
    "this _ conventional _ interpretation of the cm relation of ellipticals , however , has been questioned by worthey ( 1996 ) who points out , based on his population synthesis model ( worthey 1994 ) , that the sequence of colours and line strengths among ellipticals can be almost equally well explained by a progressive decrease of either a mean stellar metallicity or an effective stellar age .",
    "recently , bressan , chiosi , & tantalo ( 1996 ) have performed a detailed analysis of the cm relation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "in addition to broad band colours , the authors have considered absorption line strengths and their radial gradients , abundance ratios , spectral energy distribution in uv - optical region , and stellar velocity dispersion , all of which might be tightly coupled with the cm relation itself , and have suggested that the history of star formation in elliptical galaxies has probably been more complicated and heterogeneous than the galactic wind scenario mentioned above .",
    "the dual interpretations of the cm relation are now well known as the _ age - metallicity degeneracy _ of old stellar populations .",
    "arimoto ( 1996 ) have distributed the spectral templates of nearby ellipticals ( e1 for giants and e4 for dwarfs ; bica 1988 ) to about dozen groups of population synthesis ( e.bica & d.alloin ; a.pickles ; r.w.oconnell & b.dorman ; w.kollatschny & w.goerdt ; g.bruzual & s.charlot ; m.fioc & b.rocca-volmerange ; g.worthey ; b.poggianti & g.barbaro ; u.fritz-v.alvensleben ; j .- h.park & y .- w.lee ; r.f.peletier , a.vazdekis , e.casuso , & j.e.beckman ; n.arimoto & t.yamada ) , both evolutionary and optimizing , and have asked to report their best fit solutions .",
    "the results are surprising : for e1 exercise most groups come to the same conclusion ; _ i.e. , _ nuclei of giant ellipticals are old ( 10 - 19 ) gyrs and mean metallicities are at least solar or more .",
    "however , for e4 exercise , they do not agree at all .",
    "they find that nuclei of dwarf ellipticals are either 1 ) old ( @xmath7 ) gyrs and metal - rich ( @xmath8 ) , or 2 ) old ( @xmath9 ) gyrs and solar metallicity or metal - poor ( @xmath10 ) , or 3 ) young ( @xmath11 ) gyrs and solar metallicity or metal - rich ( @xmath12 ) [ see arimoto ( 1996 ) for more details ] .",
    "this confusing results for e4 exercise come from the age - metallicity degeneracy and not from different approach ( evolutionary or optimizing ) , nor from different techniques and ingredients adopted in the models .",
    "all in all , the previous interpretation that the cm relation is primarily a metallicity effect looks less secured today .",
    "it is not clear anymore whether fainter ellipticals are bluer because stellar populations are younger or because stars are more metal - deficient in average .",
    "indeed an alternative scenario for the formation of elliptical galaxies suggests that ellipticals result from the merging of lesser stellar systems taking place mostly at later times and involving substantial star formation ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; schweizer & seitzer 1992 ; fritz - von alvensleben & gerhard 1994 ) .",
    "this scenario is in good agreement with fine structures and kinematic anomalies of some elliptical galaxies ( eg . , kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) .",
    "in addition to this , the optimizing synthesis tend to pick up finite fraction of light from intermediate age populations , which also supports recent episodes of star formation in ellipticals ( oconnell 1976 ; pickles 1985b ; rose 1985 ; oconnell 1986 ; bica 1988 ; see also arimoto 1996 ) .",
    "although several attempts have been made to disentangle the age and metallicity effects on the line strengths as well as on the broad band colours ( buzzoni , gariboldi , & mantegazza 1992 ; buzzoni , chincarini , & molinari 1993 ; gonzales 1993 ; worthey 1994 ; worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) , it is still very difficult to break the age - metallicity degeneracy of elliptical galaxies so far as one sticks to photo - spectroscopic data of galaxies at the present epoch . however , it is comparatively easier to show that the cm relation is indeed primarily due to the stellar metallicity effect if one studies evolution of the cm relation as a function of look - back time .",
    "if the cm relation is an age sequence , it should evolve rapidly and should disappear beyond certain redshift , because fainter galaxies are approaching to their formation epoch .",
    "contrary , if the cm relation is a metallicity sequence and ellipticals are essentially old , it should evolve _ passively _ and should be still traced at significantly high redshifts . in this paper , we compare the theoretical evolution of the cm relation with the cm relations of cluster ellipticals at cosmological distances ( @xmath13 ) and show that the bulk of stars were probably formed early in elliptical galaxies , and that the cm relation takes its origin at early times from galactic wind feedback , thus reinsuring confirmation of previous contentions .    in  2 , we outline our population synthesis model , and in  3 we present the theoretical evolution of the cm relation and confront it with the cm diagrams of elliptical / s0 galaxies of two distant clusters abell 2390 ( @xmath2 ) and abell 851 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we discuss implications of several effects , such as dynamical disturbance , intermediate age stars , and new star formation , on the formation of elliptical galaxies in  4 .",
    "our conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "the basic structure of our new code follows arimoto & yoshii s ( 1986 ) stellar population synthesis prescription that takes into account the effects of stellar metallicity on integrated colours of galaxies for the first time .",
    "new stellar evolutionary tracks are incorporated comprehensively , and late stellar evolutionary stages are fully taken into account .",
    "the code uses the so - called _ isochrone synthesis _ technique ( cf . charlot & bruzual 1991 ) and gives the evolution of synthesized spectra of galaxies in a consistent manner with galaxy chemical evolution , and the details of the code will appear in kodama & arimoto ( 1996 ) .",
    "a brief description for essential techniques and the ingredients are given below ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "_ original tracks _ : by using the stellar evolution code provided by saio & nomoto ( 1994 ; private communication ) , we have calculated a grid of stellar evolutionary tracks for low mass stars @xmath14 from zero - age main sequence ( zams ) to tip of red giant branch ( rgb ) , and for intermediate mass and massive stars @xmath15 from zams to onset of carbon ignition .",

    "the appearance on the hr diagram is nearly identical for all masses , but the evolutionary time of our tracks is systematically @xmath22% longer than the padua tracks .",

    "ssp is defined as a single generation of coeval and chemically homogeneous stars of various masses ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ; buzzoni 1989 ) .",
    "the ssp is a building block of galactic population synthesis model and any stellar system of composite age and metallicity , like a galaxy , can be constructed as a linear combination of the ssps ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 ) . ssp spectrum is constructed as follows .",
    "isochrone is first constructed from the stellar evolutionary tracks for the specified age and metallicity .",
    "stellar spectra are assigned for each point on the isochrone and the ssp spectrum is synthesized by integrating stellar spectra along the isochrone with the number of stars , estimated from the initial mass function ( imf ) , as a weight .",

    "evolutionary behaviour of e4 m model is almost similar to e1 model which becomes fainter and redder almost monotonically towards higher redshifts ( fig.4 ) as a result of spectral reddening by redshift which is larger than intrinsic bluing of spectral shape by galaxy evolution .",
    "such a conspicuous difference between e4a and e4 m models clearly indicates that the colour and luminosity evolution must have definitive informations for _ breaking _ the age - metallicity degeneracy .",

    "stagnation at @xmath86 happens because a decrease of @xmath67-band flux is balanced by rapid dimming of @xmath69-band flux caused by its passage through ch g - band ( @xmath87 ) to @xmath83 break ; thus the feature is characteristic in gunn s @xmath80 .",

    "absolute magnitudes @xmath88 are calculated from the redshift of each cluster with a help of the adopted cosmological parameters .",
    "both clusters abell 2390 and abell 852 show well - defined cm relations of e / s0 galaxies over 3 @xmath96 4 magnitude range , and that these cm relations are almost in parallel to the cm relation at @xmath77 which is calculated from model sequences calibrated with the cm relation of coma in @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 diagram .",
    "this trend is very well reproduced by the metallicity sequence ( fig.5 ) . in the observer s frame",
    ", the cm relation evolves almost in parallel towards redder colours and is well defined even at @xmath97 .",
    "indeed , stanford , eisenhardt and dickinson ( 1995 ) recently analyzed the optical@xmath98 cm relation of elliptical galaxies in abell 370 ( @xmath99 ) and abell 851 ( @xmath3 ) and showed that these two clusters have almost identical slopes and dispersions of the cm relations to those of coma ellipticals .",
    "they therefore concluded that the cm relations of the two clusters are fully consistent with a picture of old passive evolution with age more than 10 gyrs .    due to the reason given at the end of  3.1 , the cm relations at @xmath100 and @xmath101 are nearly identical .",
    "this is the characteristic in this photometric system and there will be no wonder if clusters in this redshift interval do not show any sign of evolution in their cm relations . as pointed out by yee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and dressler et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , their photometric data have uncertainties of the zeropoint calibration , which amount to @xmath96 0.1 mag , but the slopes of cm relation should be much reliable .    for the age sequence , on the contrary , the cm relation changes drastically ( fig.6 ) .",
    "galaxies _ finally _ on the cm relation at @xmath77 become rapidly brighter and bluer as a function of lookback time , because smaller galaxies become considerably young as they approach to their formation epoch .",
    "for example , galaxies smaller than @xmath102 at @xmath77 no longer exist in the universe at @xmath100 . as a result , at @xmath103 , the cm relation holds only for 2.4 mag from the brightest end , and virtually disappears at @xmath104 .",
    "we note that the slope of the cm relation becomes progressively steeper towards higher redshifts , which is in high contrast to the metallicity sequence whose cm relation keeps its slope nearly constant from @xmath77 to 1 .",
    "the cm relations of the two clusters abell 2390 and abell 851 extend to much fainter magnitudes than the theoretical loci predicted by the age sequence models .",
    "this is a clear evidence that the cm relation can not be simply attributed to the age difference alone .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that the metallicity is the key factor that accounts for the cm relation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "our conclusion does not depend on the cosmological parameters chosen .",
    "figure 7 shows the evolution of cm relation of age sequence computed with @xmath74 km s@xmath75 mpc@xmath75 and @xmath5 . here",
    "the age of the brightest galaxies are assumed to be 12 gyrs instead of 15 gyrs because the universe is younger ( @xmath105 gyrs ) .",
    "@xmath106 gyrs corresponds to @xmath107 , which is nearly the same as that of the brightest galaxy in fig.6 .",
    "galactic wind epoch @xmath108 is set to 1.25 gyrs .",
    "the situation is worse than the @xmath74 km s@xmath75 mpc@xmath75 and @xmath76 cosmology ; the cm relation is deformed even at lower redshift , the same situation is realized when smaller formation redshift , such as @xmath109 or 2 , is adopted for a given set of cosmological parameters .",
    "galaxies defining the cm relation at high redshifts may not be simply the progenitors of those defining the cm relation at @xmath110 , since galaxies undergoing star formation at moderate to high redshifts could well enter the cm relation at lower redshifts , or alternatively , since galaxies in the cm relation at high redshift may leave it if they undergo new episode of star formation ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "however , if galaxies suffered star formation at moderate and high redshifts and if the light of the intermediate - age stellar populations dominate the luminosities of the present day ellipticals , these galaxies should deviate considerably from the cm relation , unless the star formation episodes occurred beyond a redshift of 2 ( bower et al .",
    "in other words , the light from the intermediate - age stars can not be a primary cause of the cm relation of cluster ellipticals today .",
    "figure 5 shows that the cm relations were already established in abell 2390 at @xmath2 ( in particular , e / s0 in the central field ) and abell 851 at @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that these galaxies had evolved _",
    "passively _ down to these redshifts , and if the cm relations at these redshifts are due to the age effect , the epoch of galaxy formation must have been very precisely tuned for each specified galaxy mass .",
    "we believe this is very unlikely .",
    "based on a hierarchical clustering model of galaxy formation , kauffmann ( 1995 ) demonstrated that some elliptical galaxies could be assembled and enter the cm relation even from @xmath100 to now , but she also indicated that most of the stars even in such elliptical galaxies formed fairly in early epoch such as @xmath111 and the resulting cm relation could keep the small dispersion of bower et al .",
    "( 1992b ) ( kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "kauffmann ( 1995 ) did not obtain the cm relation for ellipticals , probably because she did not include any metal enrichment in the models .",
    "she mentioned that it is likely that the observed cm relation is due to higher degree of metal enrichment in luminous galaxies .",
    "as suggested by dynamical disturbances in elliptical galaxies such as shells / ripples , multiple nuclei , and rapidly rotating and/or counter rotating cores ( e.g. , kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) , or by the intermediate - age stellar populations suggested by the optimizing population synthesis ( oconnell 1976 ; pickles 1985b ; rose 1985 ; oconnell 1986 ; bica 1988 ; rose et al .",
    "1994 ) , some ellipticals , especially those in less dense environment , must have undergone recent star formation , possibly by interaction with other galaxies .",
    "schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) analized e / s0 galaxies in the field and groups and found that their @xmath112 and @xmath59 become systematically bluer as the amount of fine structure increases , which might spread the colour dispersion , though still small , compared to those of cluster ellipticals .",
    "this in turn suggests that the interaction with other galaxies causing these dynamical disturbances can not be the major cause of the cm relations in clusters , as otherwise the cm relations should exhibit much larger dispersions than bower et al .",
    "( 1992b ) found .    in distant clusters ( @xmath113 )",
    "also , barger et al . (",
    "1996 ) showed that upto 30 per cent of cluster members could undergo recent star bursts based on the high fraction of h@xmath114-strong galaxies , though many of them are regular spheroidals ( _ i.e. , _ e / s0s ) .",
    "but we think these recent star formation should be secondary , with bulk of stars formed in early epoch , otherwise it must violate the small dispersion of bower et al ( 1992b ) .",
    "thus , some ellipticals might turn blue away from cm relation owing to the recent secondary star formation and come back again to the relation later , but in terms of the origin of cm relation , we could well push back the formation epoch far into the past .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are in excellent agreement with other , independent lines of evidence of an early completion of star formation in elliptical galaxies . the tightness of the correlation of galaxy colours with central velocity dispersion sets indeed an upper limit of @xmath6 gyrs for the age dispersion of the bulk of stars in ellipticals ( bower et al .",
    "an identical upper limit to the age dispersion of such galaxies is also established by the small dispersion on the fundamental plane ( renzini & ciotti 1993 ) . the most plausible interpretation of these evidences is that the bulk of star formation in cluster ellipticals was basically completed at @xmath115 , which is also suggested by the mg@xmath116 vs velocity dispersion relation of elliptical galaxies in abell 370 ( @xmath117 ) ( bender , ziegler , & bruzual 1996 ) .",
    "fully consistent with this picture is also the detection of _ passive _ evolution of cluster ellipticals out to @xmath118 , that seemingly requires a formation redshift in excess of @xmath6 ( aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ; dickinson 1996 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the fe ii ( uv+optical)/mg ii @xmath119 flux ratios of quasars b1422 + 231 at @xmath120 ( kawara et al .",
    "1996 ) and pks 1937 - 101 ( taniguchi et al . 1996 ) at @xmath121 indicate that the majority of stars in the host galaxies of these quasars , presumably ellipticals , have formed much earlier than these redshifts .",
    "fairly good agreements between the theoretical cm relations and the empirical ones of the two clusters are encouraging us to conduct a detailed study of cluster cm relations at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "a confrontation of the model and the hst photometry of about dozen clusters will be given in a subsequent paper ( t.kodama , n.arimoto , a.aragn-salamanca , & r.s.ellis , 1996 , in preparation ) .",
    "finally we should comment on our definition of the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "quite often the epoch of galaxy formation is defined to be the time when the protogalaxy decouples from the hubble expansion to the formation of the dark halo of the galaxy . however , this process is virtually invisible and difficult to observe . instead ,",
    "as is often done by observational cosmologists , we identify the epoch of galaxy formation with observable events , or more precisely , the time when protogalaxies ( normal massive ellipticals and bulges of spiral galaxies ) are undergoing their first major episode of star formation .",
    "then , the arguments given in this paper suggest that stars formed during this episode , at @xmath115 , dominate the light of the elliptical galaxy and the cm relation was established at that epoch .",
    "since only the galactic wind model has so far been successful in explaining the observed cm relation , we are led to reach a conclusion that the cm relation takes its origin at early times from galactic wind feedback .",
    "however , we should also mention that an alternative scenario of galaxy formation , the hierarchical clusrtering model discussed by kauffmann ( 1995 ) , could well satisfy the observational constraints we have used here .",
    "indeed , tinsley & larson ( 1979 ) were able to reproduce the metallicity  mass relation of the form @xmath122 ( tinsley 1978 ) with a model of hierarchical sequence of mergers among subsystems in which stars are assumed to form in bursts induced by galaxy  galaxy collisions .",
    "however , possible age effect on line indices which tinsley ( 1978 ) used to derive the stellar metallicity was entirely ignored . the age effect on the cm relation",
    "was fully taken into account in kauffmann s ( 1995 ) model , but the stellar metallicity effect was ignored instead . therefore , there is no successful hierarchical clustering model that can reasonably reproduce the observed cm relation .",
    "wether or not the hierarchical clustering model can account for the cm relation is yet to be fully investigated .",
    "evolutionary models for elliptical galaxies are constructed by using a new population synthesis code . the dissipative collapse picture by larson ( 1974 ) is adopted and model parameters are adjusted to reproduce the cm relation of coma ellipticals .",
    "two evolutionary sequences are calculated under the contexts of _ metallicity hypothesis _ and _ age hypothesis _ , both can equally explain the cm relation at the present epoch .",
    "the confrontation with the observational cm diagrams of e / s0 galaxies in the two distant clusters abell 2390 ( @xmath2 ) and abell 851 ( @xmath3 ) rejects the _ age hypothesis _ , and strongly suggests that the bulk of stars were formed early in elliptical galaxies with a possibly minor contamination of the intermediate - age stars , and give a reinsuring confirmation of many previous contentions that the cm relation takes its origin at early times probably from galactic wind feedback .",
    "this conclusion does not depend on the imf nor the sfr , cosmological parameters , neither .",
    "we are grateful to h.saio for providing us a stellar evolution code , and to s.yi and p.demarque for the evolutionary tracks of horizontal branch stars .",
    "we also thank to our anonymous referee for her / his constructive suggestions .",
    "thanks to the japan society for promotion of science ( jsps ) research fellowships for young scientists .",
