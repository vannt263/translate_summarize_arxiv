    "reproduce the framework of thermodynamics , which is established as equilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there is still no theory describing the general behavior of non - equilibrium systems beyond the linear response regime .",
    "thus , much effort has been devoted to the investigation of steady - state thermodynamics and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .    when liquids and gases are out of equilibrium but still remain in local equilibrium , their macroscopic dynamical behavior is precisely described by the hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "a microscopic understanding of the hydrodynamic equations for the case of dilute gases was established through the boltzmann equation  @xcite , whereas it remains unclear for a general fluid .",
    "non - trivial relations that are generally valid far from equilibrium , including the fluctuation theorems  @xcite and the jarzynski equality  @xcite , have been developed over the past two decades as a result of the time - reversal symmetry of microscopic mechanics .",
    "thanks to such universal relations , we can easily re - derive certain well - known relations , such as the mclennan ensembles , the green  kubo formula , and the kawasaki nonlinear response relation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by using a non - equilibrium identity similar to the fluctuation theorems and assuming a local gibbs distribution at the initial time , the navier  stokes equation was derived for an isolated hamiltonian system  @xcite . based on these achievements , we believe this is an opportune moment to reconsider fluid dynamics from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics .    in this paper",
    ", we study the friction coefficient of a macroscopic sphere in a fluid .",
    "starting from microscopic mechanics , kirkwood first derived the linear response formula for the friction coefficient , @xmath0 , in the form  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 is the temperature of the fluid , @xmath4 denotes a canonical ensemble average at temperature @xmath3 , and @xmath5 is the total force exerted on the sphere by the fluid at time @xmath6",
    ". the upper limit of the integral @xmath7 should be much larger than the correlation time of the force @xmath8 and much smaller than the relaxation time of the momentum of the sphere .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : kirkwood ] . note that @xmath7 could go to infinity if we take the heavy mass limit for the sphere  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results were confirmed by numerical experiments  @xcite .    by focusing on a special class of fluids ,",
    "we can obtain a more explicit expression for the friction coefficient .",
    "for instance , the friction coefficient for a dilute gas , @xmath9 , has the form  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number density of gas particles , @xmath12 is the radius of the sphere , and @xmath13 is the mass of a gas particle . as another typical example , the friction coefficient for a viscous fluid at low reynolds number , @xmath14 , is given by  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "the numerical coefficient @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 for the slip boundary condition where the velocity of the fluid normal to the sphere at the boundary is equal to that of the sphere in this direction and the shear stresses on the sphere are equal to zero , and @xmath19 for the stick boundary condition where the velocity of the fluid at the boundary is equal to that of the sphere .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : stokes_fric_intro ] ) is known as stokes law .",
    "kirkwood s formula can be derived on the basis of a mechanical system , meaning that the validity of the formula is generally independent of the nature of the fluid within the linear response regime .",
    "thus , kirkwood s formula ( [ eq : kirkwood_formula_intro ] ) corresponds to ( [ eq : kinetic_fric_intro ] ) for a dilute gas , which was confirmed by green  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ( [ eq : kirkwood_formula_intro ] ) corresponds to ( [ eq : stokes_fric_intro ] ) for a viscous incompressible fluid at low reynolds number , as confirmed by zwanzig  @xcite on the basis of fluctuating hydrodynamics  @xcite and faxn s law  @xcite in the case of the stick boundary condition .",
    "note that the linear response formula ( [ eq : kirkwood_formula_intro ] ) is effective because the reynolds number is low .",
    "we now consider the derivation of stokes law ( [ eq : stokes_fric_intro ] ) from kirkwood s formula ( [ eq : kirkwood_formula_intro ] ) without explicitly employing the hydrodynamic equations . according to the green  kubo formula  @xcite",
    ", the viscosity of the fluid , @xmath16 , can be expressed in terms of the stress correlation in the bulk of the fluid as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-component of the force on the unit area perpendicular to the @xmath23-axis at position @xmath24 and time @xmath6 ( this is the @xmath25 component of the stress tensor @xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 is an arbitrary position in the bulk of the fluid .",
    "note that @xmath7 is much larger than the correlation time of @xmath28 , and much smaller than the relaxation time of the momentum density field of the fluid .",
    "precisely speaking , the condition of this @xmath7 is different from that of @xmath7 in kirkwood s formula , but we assume that there exists some @xmath7 that satisfies both conditions . because the right - hand side of ( [ eq : kirkwood_formula_intro ] ) can be expressed in terms of the stress correlation on the surface of the sphere , we can obtain stokes law ( [ eq : stokes_fric_intro ] ) from kirkwood s formula ( [ eq : kirkwood_formula_intro ] ) and the green  kubo formula ( [ eq : green_kubo_intro ] ) if the surface stress correlation is related to the bulk stress correlation .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to establish the connection between the bulk and surface stress fluctuations .",
    "the basic concept is simple .",
    "the probability density of surface stress fluctuations is obtained from the probability density of bulk stress fluctuations by integrating out the other degrees of freedom .",
    "this procedure can be conducted in an elegant manner with the aid of large deviation theory .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    ", we did not assume the stokes equations to describe stokes flow , but rather formulated the relation between the stress fluctuations in the bulk and the stress fluctuation at the surface with the aid of large deviation theory .",
    "the heart of this derivation is the contraction principle , which is a standard technique in large deviation theory  @xcite . in the present case",
    ", we first used a phenomenological basis to apply the large deviation function to stress fluctuations in the bulk , and then applied the contraction principle .",
    "see  @xcite for another application of the contraction principle to the calculation of a large deviation function for time - averaged quantities .",
    "a similar argument has been employed to derive a generating function for the current fluctuation in stochastic non - equilibrium lattice gases  @xcite .",
    "such a phenomenological argument is called the additivity principle , and the condition of its validity can be discussed within the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "similarly , our derivation can also be formulated within fluctuating hydrodynamics , as briefly explained in [ sec : fluc_hydro ] .",
    "although there is no one - to - one correspondence between our argument and that in the additivity principle , there may be a universal concept behind these two arguments . determining a theoretical framework that provides a microscopic understanding of the phenomenological arguments would be an interesting problem .    in this paper , we studied the force from a viscous fluid .",
    "more complex cases can be discussed using a similar formulation .",
    "for example , a cross - over from the dilute case ( [ eq : kinetic_fric_intro ] ) to the viscous case ( [ eq : stokes_fric_intro ] ) , which has been observed in numerical experiments  @xcite , may be one of our next targets .",
    "a simple but less trivial example may be a brownian particle under a temperature gradient  @xcite . to elucidate the mechanism of the driving force and the friction force in this system",
    ", we must consider macroscopic fluctuation theory from microscopic mechanics , where the fluctuation of the energy flux should be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the study of the force to a small system from an active environment is a hot topic in recent non - equilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "examples of active environments include cytoskeleton networks ( under chemical reaction )  @xcite , granular materials  @xcite , and the assembly of small biological elements  @xcite .",
    "the law of the force from an active environment may be given by a phenomenological description in accordance with experimental observations .",
    "however , the nature of the force is highly non - trivial .",
    "thus , we believe that developing the theory by which the nature of the force from an active environment can be described would be a significant achievement .    finally , let us return to the formula described in ( [ eq : contraction_stress ] ) .",
    "this claims that the large deviation function on the surface is determined from the variational principle associated with the large deviation function in the bulk .",
    "note that the large deviation function is called entropy , because the large deviation of the fluctuations of thermodynamic variables is equal to the thermodynamic entropy . here",
    ", one may recall the so - called bulk - boundary correspondence in quantum many - body systems @xcite . for the moment",

    "<S> we study the friction coefficient of a macroscopic sphere in a viscous fluid at low reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> first , kirkwood s formula for the friction coefficient is reviewed on the basis of the hamiltonian description of particle systems . according to this formula , the friction coefficient is expressed in terms of the stress correlation on the surface of the macroscopic sphere . </S>",
    "<S> then , with the aid of large deviation theory , we relate the surface stress correlation to the stress correlation in the bulk of the fluid , where the latter is characterized by the viscosity in the green  kubo formula . by combining kirkwood s formula and the green  kubo formula in large deviation theory , </S>",
    "<S> we derive stokes law without explicitly employing the hydrodynamic equations . </S>"
