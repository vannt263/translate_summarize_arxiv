    "there is now substantial observational evidence@xcite that favors the existence of a smooth exotic cosmic component of energy of negative pressure .",
    "going at times under the name of a cosmological constant or quintessence or , at other times , dark energy , which we will adopt here , its true nature remains obscure .",
    "the unexpected faintness of high redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ia)suggests that the universe is accelerating today@xcite , relentlessly driven by dark energy . when the sne ia results are combined with observations of the amplitudes of primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation the overall picture seems to be one of an accelerating flat universe .",
    "since the standard flat universe , despite its well - known shortcomings , has long been favored on aesthetic and theoretical grounds@xcite , the hope has arisen that the injection of dark energy will cure its ills , particularly in regards of its age of the universe problem .",
    "thus a major industry of investigating the constraints imposed by continuously updated astrophysical observations on the dark energy in refined versions of the standard model has flourished in recent times .",
    "the present paper is one more contribution in this direction .",
    "when it is assumed that the dark energy , viewed in general to be time - dependent , does not interact with matter , the energy equations for nonrelativistic pressureless matter and dark energy decouple leading to conservation of matter and to the dark energy equation @xmath0,where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the dark energy density and pressure respectively and @xmath3 is the redshift . in this case a solvable cosmological model is obtained if a specific variation of @xmath4 is invoked@xciteor a definite parameterization for the equation of state @xmath5 is suggested @xcite .    alternatively if one assumes that the dark energy interacts with matter@xcite , the energy equations for both are coupled and one needs a definite variation for @xmath4,in addition to specifying its equation of state . in this case the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the field equations , which holds when matter and the dark energy are noninteracting , is replaced by the conservation of the sum of this tensor and an extra appended tensorial piece representing the time - dependent dark energy .",
    "here we follow this line : specifically we assume ( a ) @xmath6,where @xmath7 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of cosmic matter of density @xmath8 and pressure @xmath9,and ( b ) a one parameter form for @xmath10 .",
    "a variation @xmath11 was introduced by @xcite for the cosmological constant @xmath12,the motivation being to identify the cosmological constant with a lorentz - invariant scalar representing a form of quintessence .",
    "this cosmology is reminiscent of similar earlier attempts at identifying @xmath12 with the ricci scalar@xcite .",
    "the postulate @xmath13 is interesting because it implies that the cosmological constant vanishes in the radiation - dominated cosmic era of flat cosmology so that the successful standard primordial nucleosynthesis predictions are unaltered . in the matter - dominated era the postulate reduces to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is hubble s parameter .",
    "the cosmological constant variation @xmath16 itself was widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular @xcite have pointed out that it follows from dimensional arguments consistent with quantum gravity . since such arguments",
    "do not depend on the cosmological constant equation of state @xmath17 it is legitimate to regard them as equally valid for dark energy with @xmath18 .    extending this postulate to a dark energy with an equation of state of negative pressure",
    "we take @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "a consequence of this is that the matter density parameter @xmath21 is constant in the model .",
    "we take it to be @xmath22 .",
    "this is because a matter density parameter around 0.30 seems to be favored by observations indicating that the dark energy accounts for 2/3 of cosmic matter @xcite .",
    "in fact @xcite has strongly argued a case for @xmath23 from measurements of the physical properties of clusters , cmb anisotropies and the power spectrum of mass inhomogeneities .    for the dark energy equation of state",
    "we consider 3 models with the one - parameter forms : ( 1)@xmath24,(2)@xmath25,and ( 3)@xmath26 , where @xmath27 is constant .    model ( 1 ) , _ viz _ , @xmath28,is a generalization of the cosmological constant case @xmath29 . strictly speaking",
    "a constant @xmath30 is valid for the cosmological constant only . yet",
    "models of cosmic evolution driven by nonrelativistic matter and a quintessence component @xmath31,an exotic fluid with an arbitrary equation of state @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , have been widely studied @xcite . in a number of these models ( particularly those with tracking solutions),both the dark energy density parameter @xmath34 and @xmath30 vary so slowly with redshift @xcite as to justify the approximate use of an effective equation of state parameter @xmath35 @xcite . more generally , the absence of robust fundamental physics - based dark energy models and the difficulty to observe a time dependence of @xmath30 from cmbr@xciteor from fits to luminosity distances @xcite , admits the possibility of a @xmath30 which is constant in some specified range , and which arises as a model - independent approximation to the dark energy equation of state @xcite.(the cosmology with a dark energy @xmath36 and decoupled from ordinary matter so that @xmath37 has been recently discussed by one of us @xcite and by @xcite ) .    on the other hand parameterizations ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",

    "the form @xmath40 diverges at very high redshifts whereas this difficulty is avoided in the model @xmath41 , where @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "but , as argued by @xcite , a safer strategy , which we follow here , is to regard these parameterizations as only valid for low - z ( @xmath44 decoupling redshift @xmath45 ) and describing the late behavior of dark energy .",
    "this was done by @xcite who studied these parameterizations and found , on taking as prior @xmath46 in a flat universe , that a constant @xmath47 is preferred by the fit to the gold data for type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "also it is already known that the cosmological constant scenario remains consistent with tight constraints from new cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering data@xcite .",
    "quite generally observations seem to require dark energy with present values @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite . with this in mind , and noting that recent sneia observations from hst do not indicate a rapid variation of @xmath50 away from its cosmological constant value , we pursue , for simplicity , the following approach : we consider the preceding three @xmath50 parameterizations and set in them,@xmath51 , @xmath52 . then we investigate the constraints on the dark energy equation of state from recent supernova data and observations of the angular sizes of ultra compact radio sources .    in section 2 we present the basic equations of the models . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we examine the constraints on them from supernova and angular sizes data respectively . in discussing angular sizes",
    "we compare our results with those from a recent work by @xcite , and also consider the implications of our angular size - redshift relations in the presence of relativistic beaming of the radio sources .",

    "of the 613 sources in the sample of @xcite 468 have @xmath256 .",
    "these were placed in 6 bins with 78 objects in each bin .",
    "but @xcite show that the cosmological parameters which best fit the @xmath257 data in this case , including a best - fitting value @xmath258 for the source s intrinsic length , are not very sensitive to the choice of binning . rather than relying too heavily on a particular binning @xcite",
    "produce data points corresponding to bin sizes of 76 , 77 and 78 objects and take for their @xmath259 points values that are a composite of these three cases .",
    "their resulting data points are : @xmath260 @xmath261 and @xmath262,with standard deviation @xmath263 . using this data , and marginalizing over the sources intrinsic length,@xcite",
    "obtain the best - fit parameter values @xmath264 and the curvature parameter @xmath265,where the error bars are @xmath211 confidence limits .",
    "these results do not agree with our models .",
    "in fact the @xmath266 curve for@xcite results would lie well below the base of figure 11 .",
    "we have confirmed this disagreement by doing a @xmath112 analysis of the predictions of our models against @xcite angular size results .",
    "we will comment on this matter in the summary and conclusions section .",
    "@xcite gave qualitative and quantitative discussions of the effect of relativistic beaming on the frw @xmath171 relation .",
    "they consider a simulation sample of compact radio sources , with each source composed of two identical but oppositely directed jets having an angle @xmath267 to the line of sight , where @xmath268 .",
    "each source emits an isotropic power - law spectrum with flux density @xmath269^{3+\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath270 is the source s luminosity , @xmath97 is the luminosity distance , @xmath196 is the spectral index , @xmath271 is the jet speed / c , and @xmath272 is the lorentz factor of the jets . for a quasi - continuous jet formed out of finite - lifetime blobs the appropriate power index above is reduced to @xmath273 @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the source s lobe orientation in the frw @xmath274 relation @xmath275 replaces the source s intrinsic length @xmath159 by @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the projection of @xmath159 in the plane of the sky ( @xmath278 for a source whose jet axis lies along the plane of the sky )    it follows from equation ( [ e38])that the maximum allowed angle in the sample is given by @xcite : @xmath279^{\\frac{-1}{3+\\alpha}}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath280 denotes the sources flux density limit .",
    "@xcitedefine the average lobe orientation angle by @xmath281 since @xmath267 is small one can assume @xmath282 and insert @xmath283 into the @xmath171 relations .",
    "the essence of the @xcite quantitative method is to investigate the effect of this modification on the predictions of equation ( [ e39 ] ) .",
    "the twin - jet model of @xcite assumes that the measured angular size of the source corresponds to the separation of the jets projected onto the plane of the sky . @xcite",
    "considers this feature to be unrealistic because the flux of the receding ( away from us ) jet is very much smaller than that of the advancing(towards us)jet , for example by a factor of up to @xmath284 for a jet lorentz factor @xmath285 of 5 , and may therefore be neglected @xcite .",
    "the relativistic beaming hypothesis is primarily based on two parameters : the lorentz factor @xmath285 ( or equivalently the parameter @xmath286 the jet velocity / c ) and the viewing angle @xmath267 . in a study of 25 quasars with @xmath3 between 0.1 and 2.5",
    "( some quasars with their nonstellar radiation spectrum and evidence of jets and extended emission features also display relativistic beaming effects)@xcite find that @xmath285 increases with @xmath3 if @xmath287 but remains constant at @xmath288 if @xmath289 . with this in mind",
    "@xcite take , in their analysis of a simulation data , @xmath290 , although they point out that this choice does not qualitatively affect their results .",
    "however a choice of @xmath285 linked to a positive @xmath248,as in the 1995 paper by @xcite , is hard to justify in these days where @xmath291 ( accelerating universe ) is very probable .",
    "moreover there are other reasons that might render an arbitrary choice of @xmath285 fraught with uncertainties@xcite .",
    "in addition , geometric projection effects of components of jets of galaxies or quasars can lead to dramatically misleading values of @xmath285 .",
    "for example the transverse motion of blobs of gas across the sky in a well - studied jet in the galaxy @xmath292 ( at about @xmath293 away from us)appears to be _ superluminal _ , corresponding to a velocity nearly 6 times the speed of light!@xcite .",
    "this cosmic illusion of faster - than - light velocities is simply a projection effect , produced by the blobs of gas moving at a very small angle @xmath267 at a near - velocity - of - light speed @xcite .",
    "it is worthy of mention that doppler boosting was first discussed by @xciteto explain the apparently one - side jet in@xmath292 .    in this paper",
    "we choose to relate @xmath285 to @xmath267 by optimizing the relativistic beaming effect .",
    "this technique was used by @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite .    define the doppler factor which fundamentally characterizes relativistic beaming by ( see equation ( [ e38 ] ) ) : @xmath294^{-1}\\ ] ] optimization of relativistic beaming",
    "is obtained by requiring @xmath295 .",
    "this yields @xcite @xmath296 , or @xmath297 .",
    "since the lobe orientation bias replaces @xmath159 by @xmath298 in the @xmath171 relation , @xmath299 in equations ( [ e26])-([e29])is replaced by @xmath300 . in what follows we discuss the constraints of the observational data on @xmath300 .",
    "clearly application of the @xmath112procedure of ",
    "( 4.3.1 . ) to the modified @xmath171 relations using the binned @xcite data assigns now the best - fit values of @xmath193 to @xmath300 and leaves those of @xmath27 ( and hence of @xmath248)undisturbed .",
    "taken together the three models imply ( see table 5 ) @xmath301 mas , or , equivalently , @xmath302 pc .",
    "since milliarcsecond ultra - compact radio sources are typically less than a hundred parsec in extent the last inequality would imply that @xmath303 , or @xmath304 .",
    "( if we use @xmath305 we get @xmath306 ) .",
    "it is known @xcitethat the most powerful agn jets seem to have lorentz factors of the order of these upper bounds .",
    "we have studied in this paper supernova and compact radio sources angular sizes constraints on three cosmological models whose dynamics is driven by non - relativistic matter of density parameter @xmath307 and a smooth time - dependent dark energy component with density @xmath308 ( @xmath309 is the matter energy - momentum tensor ) and equation of state @xmath310 being either constant or redshift - dependent , with @xmath311 in the latter case .",
    "the variation @xmath312 implies that the dark energy vanishes in the early universe leaving the standard model s primordial nucleosynthesis predictions intact .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of the modified general relativity model of @xcite which can be cast in the form of a variable-@xmath12 cosmology with @xmath313 , @xmath314 being the ricci tensor .",
    "there the radiation density @xmath315 in the early universe , as in standard flat cosmology .",
    "however the friedmann equation is modified so that the standard cosmic expansion rate is altered by the factor @xmath316 where @xmath317 , a constant , satisfies @xmath318 in general relativity . here",
    "the postulated dark energy ansatz does not affect the standard cosmic expansion rate of the early universe .",
    "it reduces in the matter - dominated phase to @xmath319,a variation that was extensively studied for the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "our main results are summarized in table 5 .",
    "for the first model with @xmath30 constant ( implying by equation ( [ e6 ] ) that @xmath320 ) the supernova data of @xcite admits an accelerating universe with @xmath321 and @xmath322 ( @xmath323 ) and a coasting universe with @xmath324(@xmath325 ) . on the other hand @xcite angular sizes data",
    "allows a mildly decelerating universe with @xmath326,@xmath287 and characteristic angular scale @xmath327 ( @xmath328 ) and also a coasting cosmology with @xmath329 and @xmath330 ( @xmath331 ) .",
    "the value @xmath332 corresponding to a source s intrinsic length @xmath333 is very close to @xmath334 obtained as the best - fit value in an earlier model by @xcite where the scale factor is essentially linear in @xmath335,_viz_,@xmath336 .",
    "the results of the constant-@xmath30 model ( and also those of the other models in this paper ) do not extrapolate to the radiation dominated universe since there , as we have pointed out in the introduction , @xmath4 vanishes .",
    "nevertheless an accelerated expansion in model 1 may pose problems for structure condensation after matter dominance : structure tends not to form in the presence of cosmic acceleration .",
    "however the modest acceleration ( @xmath337 ) in model 1 corresponds to @xmath338 with upper limits @xmath339 and @xmath340 at the @xmath211 and @xmath212 confidence levels respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath30 correspond from equation ( [ e6 ] ) to @xmath341 and @xmath342 respectively so that within the limits of the quoted confidence levels a decelerating universe is not excluded .",
    "in fact it has been argued @xcite that absorption by intergalactic dust of light travelling over immensely long distances might explain the faintness of extragalactic sne ia obviating the need for a cosmic acceleration based explanation .",
    "yet we are inclined to believe that our supernova results for the coasting universe scenario are more robust because of their concordance with those of @xcite which are obtained by a different approach .",
    "a flat cosmology with dark energy of constant @xmath30 and matter density parameter @xmath21 held at @xmath46 was also considered by @xcite who however assumed noninteracting dark energy and used the larger set of the supernova `` gold '' data .",
    "they find in this case the preferred ( cosmological ) constant value @xmath343 .",
    "models 2 and 3,which by construction describe a present - day accelerating universe with @xmath344,are consistent with the data for universes that undergo deceleration - acceleration transitions at redshifts in the range @xmath345 . in the standard @xmath346 cosmological model @xmath347 for @xmath348 , in contrast with the observational value @xmath349 from the sneia analysis of @xcite .",
    "predictions of @xmath350 in seven popular quintessence models inspired by supergravity or m1 string theory have recently been studied by @xcite who noted that all of them can , in the low-@xmath3 approximation @xmath351,(@xmath352),mimic the @xmath346 model .",
    "here in models 2 and 3 the sneia data give @xmath353 and @xmath354,both values being very close to the observational result @xmath355 of @xcite . on the other hand consistency of the models with the angular size data @xcite yield @xmath356 and @xmath233 , to be compared with @xmath357 from the @xmath346 .",
    "inspection of figure 11 and table 5 leads to an important conclusion : the model s angular size - redshift curves drawn in figure 11 fit @xcite data equally well .",
    "this is a reflection of the small values and span of @xmath358 as seen in table 5 for the results : for the four models @xmath358 varies only from 4.47 to 4.75 . by comparison in the supernova test",
    "the @xmath358 values are considerably larger and lie in the range 15.4 to 19.67 so that one has more faith in the agreement of the models with the angular size data .    the predictions of the models for the critical minimum redshift in the angular size - redshift relation give @xmath187 values in the narrow interval [ 1.65,1.72 ] compared to the standard model result @xmath359 .",
    "the constant-@xmath360 and the third models have the same @xmath235 whereas the coasting universe and model 2 have @xmath361 ( the same as that of @xcite)and @xmath236 respectively .",
    "thus the minimal redshift cannot , by itself , effectively discriminate between these models .",
    "we have also compared the predictions of our models with those of the recent work of @xcitein which they revisit the old @xcitecatalogue of ultra compact radio sources and reconsider an angular size - redshift data set in the light of modern preferences of the cosmological parameters .",
    "we find that their results do not agree with our models . in a sense",
    "this is not surprising since the underlying premises of the two works are different:@xciteapproach is based on using one simple potential to test the hypothesis that vacuum energy is constant .",
    "the present models are phenomenological and based on a time - dependent dark energy coupled to matter .",
    "hence there is no overlap between the two approaches@xcite .    finally , we tested our angular size - redshift relations in the presence of relativistic beaming .",
    "relativistic beaming in the frw @xmath171 relation was investigated by @xcite .",
    "here we used a simple variation of their method in a two - jet model of radio sources with the advancing ( towards us)jet axis close to the line of sight . in this picture consistency of the models with @xcite data is found for a beaming lorentz factor @xmath362 .",
    "such an upper bound is consistent with values of the lorentz factor for powerful agn jets @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we have presented dark energy models that are in reasonable agreement with the supernova data of @xciteand in good agreement with the @xcite compact radio source angular size versus redshift binned data .",
    "the three models that we have studied are simplified versions of ones recently considered by @xcite in a different context .",
    "but as remarked by these authors comparing models for the equation of state of dark energy will remain something of a mug s game until there exists substantially more data at higher redshifts .",

    "<S> three models of a flat universe of coupled matter and dark energies with different low - redshift parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the dark energy is assumed to vary with time like the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of cosmic matter . in the radiation - dominated era </S>",
    "<S> the models reduce to standard cosmology . in the matter - dominated era they are , for modern values of the cosmological parameters , consistent with data from sne ia searches and with the data of @xcite for angular sizes of ultra compact radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the angular size - redshift tests for our models offer a higher statistical confidence than that based on sne ia data . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of our results with a recent revised analysis of angular size - redshift legacy data is made , and the implications of our models with optimized relativistic beaming in the radio sources is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we find that relativistic beaming implies a lorentz factor less than 6,in agreement with its values for powerful active galactic nuclei . </S>"
