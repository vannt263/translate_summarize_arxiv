    "thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs ( wds ) , which lead to type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) , could be triggered by the merger of two wds ( the double - degenerate scenario ( dds ) @xcite ) or by the accretion of matter from a non - degenerate star through roche - lobe overflow ( the single - degenerate scenario ( sds ) @xcite ) . in the sds , the companion to the co - wd could be a main - sequence ( ms ) , red giant ( rg ) , or helium - rich ( he ) star . in the dds , the companion could be another co  wd or he  wd . based on current studies , both scenarios are not ruled out by observations , but are also not proven by them . if both scenarios lead to sn  ia , it is still unclear which channel(s ) in the sds and dds dominate(s ) the sne  ia , and by what fraction @xcite .",
    "recent multi - dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of sn impact on the non - degenerate binary companions in the sds suggest that the companions should survive the sn impact and could be detectable . therefore , one of the direct methods to distinguish between the sds and dds is to search for the surviving companions ( scs ) in sn  ia remnants ( ia  snrs ) .",

    "we present numerical results in   2 and compare them with searches for scs in galactic ia snrs in   3 , in the magellanic clouds in   4 , and in m31 and m82 in ",
    "5 . finally",
    ", we discuss the evidence for the sds channel for sne  ia and present our conclusions in the last section .",
    "in this section , we discuss and predict some possible observables of scs in nearby ia  snrs and describe differences between sc candidates and unrelated stars in ia  snrs . in particular , we calculate the colors , magnitudes , effective temperatures , and photospheric radii of ms- and he - scs as functions of time .",
    "we also predict the magnitude and effective temperature changes as functions of time .",
    "the linear and rotational velocities of scs are also discussed .",
    "we also suggest upper limits for the ni / fe contamination in scs .      in simulations of ms- and he - scs , the bolometric luminosity , effective temperature , and photospheric radius",
    "are directly determined using the stellar evolution code mesa ( modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ; @xcite ) . to facilitate direct comparison with optical observations ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity is converted to broad band magnitudes .",
    "additional observable quantities such as the strength of absorption lines require the treatment of detailed radiation transfer effects in stellar atmosphere models , which are not considered in this paper .    given the effective temperature and photospheric radius of a sc , the magnitude of the sc can be estimated under the assumption that the photosphere emits a blackbody radiation spectrum .",
    "we have considered several different filters with their corresponding sensitivity functions in this study , including the johnson - cousins - glass ubvir system and the hst / wfc3 system .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are calculated in the ab magnitude system . for a given extinction , @xmath3",
    ", the extinction curve can be calculated using the fitting formula in @xcite .",
    "the stellar parameters of ms- and he - sc models in our previous work are summarized in table  [ tab_models ] .",
    "figures  [ fig_hr_all ] and [ fig_hr_bvi ] illustrate the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram in different representations using the b and v wavebands and hst wavebands respectively .",
    "he - scs are sdo - like stars that exhibit stronger emission in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands , while ms - scs exhibit greater emission in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands ( a - k subgiants ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of ms - scs ( he - scs ) span the range @xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "the brightest phase of ms - scs corresponds to ia  snr ages of @xmath10  yr , which are similar to the ages of most known historic nearby ia  snrs ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if these snrs originated from normal sne  ia via the sds ms or the he star channels , scs should be detectable . in the rg donor channel , almost the entire envelope of a rg",
    "should be removed during the sn impact ( @xcite ; p12a ) .",
    "therefore , the sc in ia  snr will no longer be a giant star , but could be a helium degenerate core star with a shallow hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "it should be noted that in our calculations , we assume normal sne  ia with chandrasekhar mass explosions , and the explosions are initially spherically symmetric .",
    "asymmetric explosions , sub - chandrasekhar , or super - chandrasekhar mass explosions may reduce or enhance the evolution of post - impact luminosity ( p12b ) .",
    "in addition to comparisons of the colors and magnitudes of sc candidates , the long term variation of magnitude and effective temperature changes is an alternative way to identify the sc . in figure  [ fig_hr_all ]",
    "we see that ms - scs show rapid luminosity changes but maintain similar effective temperatures in the early few hundred years after an explosion . therefore , a slight magnitude drop but without color change for a few years after the first observation is expected for ms - scs .",
    "on the other hand , he - scs show both magnitude and color changes in the first ten years .",
    "figure  [ fig_mag ] and figure  [ fig_teff ] show the magnitude and effective temperature variations of our ms- and he - scs as functions of time .",
    "brighter sc models ( models  a , b , and d ) have a maximum magnitude change rate of 0.3  mag  yr@xmath11 in the v - band when their ia  snrs have ages less than five hundred years . for models  c , e , and f ,",
    "the ms - scs show a smoother rate of change of magnitude during the first thousand years , but the maximum rate is less than 0.01  mag  yr@xmath11 , which is very difficult to detect with current optical telescopes . model  g radiates the deposited energy immediately and shows a positive magnitude gradient ( gets dimmer ) .",
    "the rate of change of magnitude for model  g is less than @xmath12  mag  yr@xmath11 .",
    "the effective temperatures of all our ms - sc models are roughly constants .",
    "the highest rate of change is about @xmath13  k  yr@xmath11 for models a , b , and d and @xmath14  k  yr@xmath11 for other models .",
    "however , the rates of change of magnitude and effective temperature for he - scs could be notable .",
    "all our he - scs change by @xmath15  mag  yr@xmath11 in the b - band during the first three years and maintain @xmath16  mag  yr@xmath11 over the first decade .",
    "furthermore , he - scs increase in temperature by @xmath17  k  yr@xmath11 during the first @xmath18 years and then decrease by @xmath19  k  yr@xmath11 in the first decade .",
    "therefore , these magnitude and effective temperature changes could be detected in young and nearby ia  snrs if the sc is a he star .",
    "a sc will have an abnormal speed due to its original orbital speed plus the sn kick .",
    "the momentum transfer between the sn ejecta with the donor star will give a kick velocity perpendicular to its orbital velocity .",
    "the kick velocity is about @xmath20  km  s@xmath11 for ms and he star donor channels , and @xmath21  km  s@xmath11 for the rg donor channel ( p10 ; p12a ; ) . by adding the kick velocity to the orbital velocity , the final linear speed at the end of supernova impact is @xmath22  km  s@xmath11 for ms - scs , @xmath23  km  s@xmath11 for he - scs ( see table  [ tab_models ] ) , and @xmath24  km  s@xmath11 for rg - scs ( p12a ) .",
    "the contribution from the kick velocity could be as high as @xmath25 in the ms donor channel .",
    "assuming the co  wd has a similar orbital speed ( but opposite direction ) at the time of explosion and the snr is moving with this orbital speed , the observational error circle has to include a radius of at least @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the age of the snr , and @xmath28 is the inclination angle .",
    "the theoretical estimate of the maximum @xmath29 is @xmath17  km  s@xmath11 for the he star donor channel .",
    "the surface rotational speed of a sc also could be an important signature for sc searches in nearby ia  snrs . at the time of the sn",
    "ia explosion , the companion should be synchronized by tidal locking and be rapidly rotating , resulting in a surface rotational speed close to @xmath30  km  s@xmath11 for ms donors , @xmath31  km  s@xmath11 for he star donors , and @xmath24  km  s@xmath11 for rg donors ( p12a ; ) . however , because of the angular momentum loss accompanying mass stripping , the surface rotational speed could drop to @xmath32  km  s@xmath11 for ms donors and @xmath33  km  s@xmath11 for he star donors after the sn impact ( p12b ; p13 ) .",
    "once the sn ejecta escape and the sc reaches hydrostatic equilibrium , the rotational speed could keep decreasing or increasing as a result of post - impact contraction or expansion . if we assume the specific angular momentum is conserved during the post - impact evolution , the surface rotational speed could be in the range from @xmath34  km  s@xmath11 to @xmath31  km  s@xmath11 , depending on the amount and depth of sn energy deposition and the age of the snr ( see figure  11 in p12b and figure  12 in p13 ) .",
    "in p12b and p13 , we have shown that the surface rotation speed will first drop to @xmath35  km  s@xmath11 after the sn impact and then keep decreasing to @xmath36  km  s@xmath11 during the early expansion over a timescale of @xmath37  yr for ms - scs and @xmath38  yr for he - scs .",
    "the stellar expansion is due to the release of energy deposited by the sn ejecta .",
    "once the deposited energy has all been released , the envelope of the sc will contract , releasing its gravitational energy . in this phase ,",
    "the rotational speed may increase up to @xmath38  km  s@xmath11 for ms - scs and @xmath31  km  s@xmath11 for he - scs .",
    "for most of the lifespan of ia  snrs with ages less than a thousand years , ms - scs are slowly rotating subgiants but he - scs are rapidly rotating sdo / b stars .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the contamination from sn ejecta may provide observable features in iron absorption lines , which can be used to identify the scs in ia  snrs . in p12a , we showed that the amount of ni / fe contamination at the surfaces of the scs is @xmath39 for ms star companions , @xmath40 for he star companions , and @xmath41 for rg companions . at the current stage",
    ", our simplified post - impact evolution method can not predict the strength of any absorption or emission lines during the evolution , but we can provide an order - of - magnitude estimate by assuming that these contaminated material are uniformly mixed in the stellar envelope . the estimated upper limit for the nickel - to - hydrogen - plus - helium ratio is about @xmath42 for ms - scs , @xmath43 for he - scs , and @xmath44 for rg - scs ( p12a ) .",
    "the rate of galactic sne ( including type i and type ii ) is about @xmath45  sne per century , and @xmath46 of them are sne  ia @xcite .",
    "these rates suggest that there should be more than 2,500 snrs in our galaxy , and 300 of them are ia  snrs , if snrs are recognizable for ages less than @xmath47  yrs .",
    "however , only @xmath48 galactic snrs have been identified @xcite , and only four of them are known as ( or likely to be ) ia  snrs ( @xmath49 ) . therefore , a search for a sc in the central region of a snr could also be an alternative indirect method to identify ia  snrs among currently - known snrs .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] shows a summary of the four possible galactic ia  snrs ( and/or ia  snr candidates ) : sn  1006 , sn  1572 , sn  1604 , and rcw  86 .",
    "the young ( @xmath50  yr ) and nearby ( @xmath51  kpc , @xcite ) snr , tycho s snr , has been identified as a normal ia  snr by its scattered - light echo @xcite . the non - thermal x - ray arc within tycho s snr could arise from an interaction between the sn ejecta and mass ejected from the companion star , giving support for the sds as the progenitor @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a subgiant star , namely tycho  g , characterized by a high radial velocity @xmath52  km  s@xmath11 that could be related to the original orbital speed of the white dwarf companion in the sds .",
    "* hereafter k13 ) recently updated this radial velocity to @xmath53  km  s@xmath11 , which is still anomalous for the region .",
    "figure  [ fig_snrs ] shows our predictions of post - impact conditions of ms - scs compared with observations by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter gh09 ) and k13 .",
    "gh09 reported that tycho g is a subgiant with effective temperature @xmath54  k , surface gravity @xmath55  dex , and [ fe / he ]  @xmath56  dex , using keck high resolution optical spectra .",
    "the distance of tycho  g is also comparable to that of tycho s snr . using the same data but with a slightly different analysis tool",

    "we note that our model e is more massive ( @xmath64 ) than the mass ( @xmath2 ) assumed in gh09 and k13 , and the stellar radius and evolution stage are also different with what is suggested in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b14 ) . the evolution of scs after",
    "the sn explosion depends not only on the amount of mass lost and energy deposition , but also on the depth of energy deposition",
    ". therefore , a less massive companion , different evolutionary stage , asymmetric explosion , or sub - chandrasekhar mass explosion may better match tycho  g. if tycho  g is indeed similar to our model  e , we predict a magnitude change of @xmath65  mag for every 10 years ( figure  [ fig_mag ] ) .",
    "b14 determined high - accuracy proper motions for @xmath66 sc candidates , including tycho  g , in the central region of tycho s snr .",
    "they obtained a tangential velocity for tycho  g of @xmath67  km  s@xmath11 . together with the observed radial velocity ( 80  km  s@xmath11 ) of tycho  g and the average radial velocity ( 37  km  s@xmath11 ) in the direction of tycho s snr from the sun , the linear velocity with respect to the center of tycho s snr",
    "can be determined to be @xmath68  km  s@xmath11 , if tycho  g were the sc ( b14 ) .",
    "this value is half that of the linear velocities in our models in table  [ tab_models ] .",
    "an inclination angle @xmath69 , orbital separation @xmath70 , and orbital period @xmath71  days are also suggested by b14 .",
    "these progenitor system data are consistent with the spectroscopic observation by gh09 indicating that tycho  g is a g - type subgiant .",
    "however , we note that the linear velocity does not equal the orbital speed in the binary system , since the sn kick may contribute up to one - third of its final linear speed ( p12a ; ) .",
    "* hereafter k09 ) found an upper limit for the rotational speed of tycho g of @xmath72  km  s@xmath11 , updated to @xmath73  km  s@xmath11 in k13 , causing them to question tycho  g as a sc candidate .",
    "p12a , p12b , and studied the sn  impact and post - impact conditions of ms - like binary companions and found that this discrepancy can be resolved due to the loss of angular momentum during the sn impact and post - impact expansion .",
    "however , even when applying the inclination angle in b14 , our best model ( model  e ) still has a @xmath74  km  s@xmath11 , which lies above the upper limit observed by k09 and k13 .",
    "similar results have been found in as well .",
    "therefore , a less massive or less compact companion model is required to better fit with observations .",
    "fortunately , using the inclination angle and orbital period derived in b14 , a low rotational speed of @xmath75  km  s@xmath11 can be calculated by assuming tidal locking , explaining the non - detection of rotational speed in k09 and k13 .    on the other hand , @xcite comments that the absence of an fe  i line feature at 372  nm in tycho  g argues against the sc interpretation as there is no evidence for absorption due to the sn ejecta in the stellar spectrum .",
    "in contrast , tycho  e shows a strong blueshifted fe  i absorption line without redshifted lines , which implies that it is within the remnant and that its projected position is close to the center of tycho s snr , possibly qualifying it as another sc candidate .",
    "however , k13 suggests that tycho e is far behind the snr and hence the low column density on the receding side of the remnant could explain the lack of redshifted lines .",
    "the recent observation of tycho  e reveals an effective temperature @xmath76  k and surface gravity @xmath77  dex ( k13 ) , which is also close to our model e ( @xmath60  k and @xmath61  dex )",
    ". however , the low radial velocity ( @xmath78  km  s@xmath11 ) and large distance ( @xmath79  kpc , in comparison to @xmath80  kpc ) make it less likely to be the sc , although the distance uncertainty is large .",
    "finally , gh09 also have suggested that tycho  e could be a double lined binary , which does not provide support for it as a sc .",
    "further detailed observations of these sc candidates are necessary to establish whether any of them is connected to tycho s sn .      the lack of a compact remnant star , and the amount of iron observed inside the snr @xcite indicate that sn  1006 was a sn  ia .",
    "measurements of its proper motion indicate that sn  1006 is the closest historical ia  snr with a distance @xmath81  kpc @xcite and an age of @xmath82  yr . the geometric center of the remnant is also well determined in x - ray and radio @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the foreground extinction is low due to its high galactic latitude ( @xmath83 ) , providing a good environment in which to search for sc candidates .",

    "both teams suggest that there is no evidence for the survival of a sc in the central region of sn  1006 .",
    "k12 observed all stars to a limit of 0.5  @xmath84 at the distance of sn  1006 within the central 2 arcminutes .",
    "they found no stars as bright as predicted in @xcite and @xcite , and no stars show significant rotation .",

    "( @xmath85  cm  s@xmath86 , @xmath87  k ) and b14707 ( @xmath88  cm  s@xmath86 , @xmath89  k ) in gh12 have surface gravities similar to our model g ( @xmath90  dex , @xmath91  k ) , although with lower effective temperatures ( see figure  [ fig_snrs ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the star b90474 has a high radial velocity ( @xmath92  km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "however , unlike the case of tycho s sn , sn  1006 lies 500  pc above the galactic plane , and therefore , the radial velocities of surrounding stars do not exhibit a simple trend .",
    "in addition , b90474 has a larger distance uncertainty ( @xmath93  kpc ) and b14707 ( @xmath94  kpc ) lies at a much closer distance than the snr",

    "the interaction of the supernova ejecta with circumstellar material in kepler s snr provides evidence that kepler s snr may have originated from the sds in an evolutionary channel consisting of a wd and an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",
    "however , the circumstellar medium could be also explained by the stellar wind from a massive progenitor in core - collpase supernova .",
    "the low iron mass of @xmath104 @xcite and a progenitor mass of @xmath105 @xcite suggest that kepler s sn may not be a sn  ia .",

    "additional observations are required to test these candidates .    as we pointed out in   2 ,",
    "nearly all the envelope of a rg should be removed during the sn impact in the rg donor channel , and this is likely to be the case for the agb donor channel as well .",

    "it was recently identified as a ia  snr by @xcite and @xcite , who estimate that the integrated fe - k emission corresponds to a total fe mass of about @xmath2 .",
    "its possible association with sn  185 is somewhat dubious since it would imply the age of rcw  86 is 1,829  yr . the large size of its radius at an estimated distance of @xmath108  kpc @xcite ( or @xmath109  kpc ; ) suggests a very high shock speed ( @xmath110  km  s@xmath11 ) or a much older age .",
    "one explanation is that it originated in a cavity explosion , although cavity explosions are more common in core - collapse sne .",
    "hence , the connection between rcw  86 and sn  185 has yet to be established .",
    "in addition , the derived ambient density ( @xmath111  @xmath112 ) found by @xcite suggests that an unusually low - density cavity surrounds the snr .",
    "this can be understood either as resulting from the existence of a strong stellar wind from the progenitor itself or as an outflow from the nearby ob association discovered by @xcite . if rcw  86 was a member of this group , the age of this group may place some constraints on the delay - time of this sn  ia , although the ages of these ob stars are still unknown .",
    "the wind - blown bubble scenario by @xcite suggests that rcw  86 originated in the sds .",
    "therefore , a search for sc candidates in rcw  86 seems reasonable .",

    "all ms - sc models reach the brightest phase ( @xmath113 ) and highest effective temperature at around @xmath114  yr , depending on the model .",
    "therefore the nearby distance and low extinction ( @xmath115 ; @xcite ) make it easier to distinguish sc from unrelated stars .",

    "the mcs are nearly face - on galaxies , minimizing confusion along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the foreground galactic extinction is low , and the internal extinction of the mcs is modest @xcite . finally , the star formation history ( sfh ) and metallicity of the mcs are different than those of the milky way @xcite , allowing the possibility of testing sn  ia progenitors in different type of galaxies @xcite .",
    "ten ia  snrs have been reported to lie in the lmc and four in the smc ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . since only four galactic ia  snrs have been identified , these fourteen ia  snrs provide a larger sample of ia  snrs to search for scs .",
    "in addition , the distances of ia  snrs in the lmc and smc are known more accurately than for galactic ia  snrs , which reduces the uncertainties in comparing observations with the theoretical predictions .",

    "we point out that @xcite found a sub - giant star in snr 0519 - 69.0 ( @xmath123  mag , and @xmath124 ) .",
    "although this star is consistent with our model g star ( @xmath125  mag , and @xmath126 ; the black line in figure  [ fig_snrs ] ) , it lies close to the edge of the possible error circle , which suggests that it may not be the sc of snr  0519 - 69.0 unless the explosion was asymmetric .",
    "besides the lmc and smc , other nearby galaxies can provide samples that probe diverse environments for scs .",
    "in particular , the metallicities and sfhs in other nearby galaxies differ from those of the milky way and magellanic clouds , which could affect pre - sn conditions , the sn  ia explosion itself , and , potentially , the post - impact evolution .    in section  [ sec_predictions ]",
    ", we have shown that our predicted ms - scs ( he - scs ) span a range of absolute magnitude @xmath8 ( @xmath127 ) in f555w ( f438w ) . by using hst / wfc3 ( with u ,",
    "b , v , and i filters ) , the limiting magnitude with s / n of 10 for point sources is @xmath128 with a one hour exposure , and @xmath129 for a 10 hour exposure , giving maximum distance moduli of @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum detectable distance of @xmath0  mpc ( @xmath1  mpc ) if there is no extinction .",
    "however , as extinction varies from galaxy to galaxy , the maximum detectable distance would be smaller in extreme cases .",
    "given that he - scs reach their maximum brightness at @xmath38  yr after sn explosions and then fade within @xmath30  yr ( p13 ) , their @xmath5 magnitudes are likely less than 1 for historic ia  snrs .",
    "this yields a distance limit of @xmath132  mpc .",
    "however , the short timescale ( @xmath38  yrs ) of their luminous phase provides the possibility to detect slow transitions of their brightness at the locations of recent nearby sne  ia with @xmath133  mpc .",
    "we note that the timescale for the decay of the light curve from the supernova may take longer than the luminous phase of the sc and , hence , that the maximum detectable distance could be smaller .",
    "snrs in nearby galaxies , including the andromeda galaxy ( m31 or ngc  224 ; ) , ngc  300 @xcite , m82 @xcite , ngc  4214 , ngc  5204 , ngc  5585 , ngc  6946 , m81 , and m101@xcite , have been studied recently .",
    "therefore , ia  snrs in these galaxies should be targeted for sc searches .",
    "however , it is unclear whether these snrs are ia  snrs .      more than 26 snrs ( including type  i and type ii ) have been identified in the andromeda galaxy at 0.79  mpc by @xcite and .",
    "m31 has a distance modulus of 24.5 , which makes it possible to detect all of our ms - scs and most he  scs using hst / wfc3 .",
    "the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ( phat ) multi - cycle program has observed about one third of m31 using hst @xcite .",
    "its uvis data reached a magnitude limit of @xmath134 in the f275w and f336w bands ; acs data reach maximum depths of @xmath135 magnitudes in f475w and @xmath128 magnitudes in f814w in the uncrowded outer disk . in these same regions ,",
    "wfc3/ir data reach maximum depths of @xmath136 and @xmath137 in f110w and f160w , respectively .",
    "have listed 26 x - ray snrs and 20 x - ray snr candidates in m31 based on their x - ray , optical , and radio emission , which is the most recent complete list of x - ray snrs in m31 .",
    "therefore , using their list together with phat s data , it may be possible to identify sc candidates .",
    "sn  1885a ( s  andromedae ) is a subluminous sn  ia in m31 @xcite .",
    "its young age and the small size of its remnant make it easier to search for a sc .",
    "however , the surrounding light is dominated by the bulge of m31 , making sc searches difficult unless the sc is overluminous .",
    "sn  2014j was discovered by stephen fossey and his students on january 21 , 2014 and reported as a sn  ia on january 22 , 2014 @xcite .",
    "sn  2014j is the closest sn  ia ( @xmath138  mpc ; @xcite ) discovered in the past 42 years .",
    "the next close one is sn  1972e ( in ngc  5253 ) with a distance of @xmath139  mpc .",
    "sn  2011fe is also a nearby sn  ia discovered in the modern astronomical era .",
    "however , the distance of sn  2011fe ( in m101 ; @xmath140  mpc , @xcite ) is above our predicted maximum distance for ms - scs .",
    "a search for scs in sn  2011fe will be very challenging .",
    "furthermore , the emptiness of the surrounding medium @xcite and the lack of pre - explosion optical and x - ray source @xcite suggest a dds progenitor for sn  2011fe .",
    "sn  2014j is almost twice as close as sn  2011fe , and the distance ( 3.5  mpc ) is within our predicted detection limit ( 4  mpc ) for ms - scs , though the distance is close to the limit .",
    "hst archival observations do not rule out sds progenitors such as recurrent novae or some classical novae @xcite . however",
    ", even when the snr becomes transparent , any ms - sc would need a few hundred years to become bright enough to be detected by hst .",
    "if the sc is a he - sc , a bright luminous ob - like star is expected to be observed in the next few decades .",
    "we have determined the colors and magnitudes of seven ms- and four he - sc models based on our stellar evolutionary calculations ( p12b , p13 ) and predicted their rates of change as functions of time .",
    "we have also studied the linear and rotational speeds of scs and the potential ejecta contamination of scs .",
    "comparisons of the model predictions for scs with the galactic sne 1572 and 1006 are presented , assuming all the candidate stars have the same distance as their host snrs . in particular , it is found that both tycho  e ( @xmath76  k , @xmath77  dex ) and tycho  g ( @xmath54  k , @xmath55  dex ) approximately fit our predicted ms - sc model  e ( @xmath60  k , @xmath61  dex ) , although there are small discrepancies ( k13 ) . furthermore , two sub - giants in the error circle of sn  1006 are also found to have magnitudes consistent with our ms  sc model  g ( @xmath141  k , @xmath90  dex ) , but have lower effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "however it should be noted that the uncertainties in the distances of these sc candidates are large , and that the derived effective temperatures and surface gravities are not consistent in different papers .",
    "in addition to the galactic ia  snrs , a sub - giant in the snr  0519 - 69.0 is consistent with the magnitude and color of our model  g , but the projected position in the snr is too far from the center @xcite .",
    "if such a candidate is a confirmed sc , then the original orbital speed ( plus sn kick ) would be much higher than expected unless the explosion was asymmetric .",
    "although higher orbital speeds would be expected for he  scs , there is no evidence for such a candidate .",
    "based on the current sample of sne  ia companion searches , it is more likely that most have originated from the dds or peculiar sds channels .",
    "peculiar sds channels such as the m - dwarf channel @xcite or the spin up / down channel @xcite may explain the non - detection of sc candidates in ia  snrs . to obtain a better understanding of the progenitor systems of sn  ia ,",
    "we encourage further sc searches in other galactic or nearby extragalactic ia  snrs . unlike galactic ia  snrs , which have large distance uncertainties , the distances of extragalactic ia  snrs",
    "are relatively well - known .",
    "we predict that the maximum detectable distance of ms - scs ( he - scs ) is @xmath0  mpc ( @xmath1  mpc ) , if the apparent magnitude limit is 27 with no extinction , suggesting that the lmc , smc , and m31 are excellent targets in which to search for scs .",
    "furthermore , we also predict he - scs will not only show high luminosity and effective temperature ( luminous ob - like stars ) , but also show a rate of magnitude in b of @xmath142  mag  yr@xmath11 and a rate of change of effective temperature of @xmath143  k  yr@xmath11 in the first decade since explosion",
    ". future observations of he - sc candidates should look into their magnitude and color changes as well",
    ".    similar analysis can be applied to core - collapse ( cc ) sne as well .",
    "the observed high fraction of sn  ib / c can not be explained by single stellar evolution , suggesting that a high fraction of ccsne were in binary systems @xcite .",
    "however , the ejected - mass - and - energy and companion types and separations are very different from those in sn  ia . in addition",
    ", the companion does not need to be in roche lobe overflow at the time of explosion .",
    "therefore , the evolution of scs in ccsne could be very different and vary from case to case .",
    "the impact of ccsne on binary companions and their subsequent evolution are important future work in this area .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "kcp thanks you - hua chu for useful discussions about ia  snrs in the lmc .",
