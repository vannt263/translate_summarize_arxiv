    "there is reason to believe in the existence of a minimal length that can in principle be measured .",
    "this viewpoint stems in part from the realization that if enough mass - energy is confined to a small region of space , a black hole must form .",
    "for example if one increases the energy of colliding particles beyond the planck energy , one expects the short distance effects to be hidden behind an event horizon .",
    "in fact , as the energy is increased , the size of this event horizon increases .",
    "one way an effective minimal length might arise is through the discretization of spacetime .",
    "one might also ask the question whether the generic appearance of a minimal length in a low - energy effective theory of quantum gravity survives in the full theory when its ultraviolet sector is completed .    in a theory of quantum gravity a fundamental distance scale",
    "is expected to be of order the planck length @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of a minimal length invites the possibility that there are corrections to the usual heisenberg uncertainty principle such that it becomes what is known as a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) : @xmath1 we have set @xmath2 .",
    "the terms in the ellipsis represent higher order contributions which should generically be present .",
    "they may involve higher order powers of @xmath3 , but might also involve expectation values of higher powers of the momentum .",
    "we shall sometimes refer to the expression in eq .",
    "( [ gup ] ) minus these extra terms as the truncated gup .",
    "the minimal length in the theory is governed by the parameter @xmath4 , and the generalized uncertainty principle in eq .",
    "( [ gup ] ) shows that there is a minimum dispersion @xmath5 for any value of @xmath3 at least as long as the first two terms on the right hand side are considered .",
    "interest in a minimum length or the generalized uncertainty principle has been motivated by studies of the short distance behavior of strings@xcite , considerations regarding the properties of black holes@xcite , and de sitter space@xcite . in recent years",
    "the generalized uncertainty principle has been studied extensively in the literature@xcite .",
    "most of the research does not attempt to derive the uncertainty principle from quantum gravity explicitly .",
    "rather the modifications to the uncertainty relation are motivated by what is a general property on any theory of quantum gravity , and the implications of the gup are analyzed phenomenologically .",
    "other approaches have involved trying to understand the quantum mechanical basis for the uncertainty principle in eq .",
    "( [ gup ] ) often by considering a truncation of the full series of terms on the right hand side .",
    "commutation relations can be postulated which give rise to this truncated series and the associated algebra has been studied . in this paper",
    "we try to understand how the gup can arise in a simple quantum mechanical model ( which is well - understood ) , and how the gup is in fact completed when all the relevant terms are included .",
    "this means we derive all the terms in the ellipsis in eq .",
    "( [ gup ] ) .",
    "the model contains an operator with discrete eigenvalues in the familiar way : because the phase space is compactified .",
    "the model is a quantum theory with a position operator that has discrete eigenvalues , so it may be considered a theory with a minimum length associated with the difference between eigenvalues .",
    "however we do not a priori exclude the possibility that a physical state can be an eigenstate of this operator .",
    "that leads us to consider quantum mechanics on a circle .",
    "usually one is concerned with the problem of a spatial direction compactified such that the eigenvalues of the momentum operator are quantized . here",
    "we ( eventually ) consider the somewhat more unusual situation where one considers the _ momentum _ to be compactified , thus resulting in a quantum mechanics with discrete eigenvalues for the operator associated with a spatial coordinate .",
    "quantum mechanics on a circle is a simple physical problem which has a long history , and does not contain gravity explicitly .",
    "the compactification of momentum does provide a discrete spectrum for the position coordinate which may be a feature of a full theory of quantum gravity .",
    "we are able to derive the generalized uncertainty relation in eq .",
    "( [ gup ] ) and calculate the coefficient @xmath6 in terms of the compactification `` radius '' of the momentum circle .",
    "in fact we are able to obtain straightforwardly the whole series of higher order terms ( i.e. higher powers of @xmath3 and factors like @xmath7 ) on the right hand side of the relation for minimum uncertainty wave packets .",
    "since the terms explicitly expressed in eq .",
    "( [ gup ] ) should represent only an approximation to a full expression , this may shed some light ( at least as far as the simple model captures the necessary features of a full theory of gravity ) on how the gup fits into a complete theory of discretized spacetime .",
    "we believe this derivation of a generalized uncertainty principle in an elementary context may be useful in understanding what features of a discrete spacetime may be needed to obtain the uncertainty principle in a more realistic context .",
    "quantum mechanics on a circle has been chosen simply for simplicity and because it is well - studied in other contexts .",
    "it makes the presentation particularly elementary since modified bessel functions are needed to describe the wavefunctions and the coefficients of the eigenfunctions of the minimum uncertainty wave packets .",
    "the study of the proper way to treat quantum mechanics on a compact space goes back to the earliest days of the subject@xcite .",
    "a history of the subject can be found in ref .",
    "therefore it has been known for a long time that the uncertainty principle as derived for a circular coordinate ( phase ) operator and the angular momentum operator is inadequate because the angular phase variable is periodic .",
    "more recent attempts to rectify this problem led to various definitions for the phase dispersion .",
    "judge defined@xcite @xmath8 for which he conjectured the uncertainty relation @xmath9 this conjecture was later proved by bouten , maene and van leuven@xcite , and discussed further in ref .",
    "the form of the uncertainty relation in eq .",
    "( [ judge ] ) allows for an angular momentum eigenstate ( for which @xmath10 ) to satisfy the inequality because the bounded uncertainty in @xmath11 causes the denominator to vanish for these eigenstates . the uncertainty relation in eq .",
    "( [ judge ] ) allows for a treatment of the case of an angular momentum eigenstate for which @xmath10 whereas the dispersion in the angle is bounded @xmath12 .",
    "the subtle issue of an uncertainty principle involving the phase operator was subsequently discussed in a classic paper , ref .",
    "@xcite . there , hermitian cosine and sine operators were defined and various uncertainty principles were suggested .",
    "the crucial realization is that the angular coordinate variable @xmath13 is not suitable for quantization , and one should use a phase operator @xmath14 ( or alternatively the cosine and sine operators ) .",
    "this early important work is developed and reviewed in ref .",
    "this has been discussed and reviewed further and applications to more general situations have appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the formulation of ohnuki and",
    "kitakado@xcite it was shown that there are in fact an infinite number of representations of the algebra of operators which can be understood in terms of a certain gauge field .",
    "these representations are classified by the value of a parameter @xmath15 which specifies the gauge inequivalent representations and interpolates between the discrete eigenvalues in the operator spectrum . finally in ref .",
    "@xcite the minimum uncertainty wave packets on the circle were shown to reduce in the large radius limit to the usual gaussian wave packet .",
    "it is this limit of a large radius that will most concern us here , as we will show how the usual heisenberg uncertainty principle expressed in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath3 on the line get modified in the large radius limit in which the corrections should be small .",
    "one potential benefit of identifying the generalized uncertainty principle in this limit is that one can extend the results to cases that are not approximately quantum mechanics on the line , and study how the minimum uncertainty wave packets on the circle interpolate between the gaussian wave packet on the line to the ( angular ) momentum eigenstate on the circle .",
    "this extends the generalized uncertainty principle in eq .",
    "( [ gup ] ) , at least for this simple case , to physical situations that do not require the `` extra '' terms to be subleading in magnitude .",
    "finally we note that the minimum uncertainty wave packets we examine are well - known in the field of quantum optics where they are sometimes called ( circular ) squeezed states .",
    "this is a rich and well - developed subject and we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "coherent and squeezed states have been developed for general lie symmetries .",
    "important examples are the barut - girardello coherent states@xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "our emphasis is different , however , in that we are primarily concerned with the properties of the uncertainty relations for a compactified phase space in the large radius limit .",
    "it is in this limit that the corrections to the usual heisenberg uncertainty relation involving a position operator @xmath16 and a momentum operator @xmath17 can be understood to be small . in a more general context one is interested in how to quantize a system with some classical phase space .",
    "of particular importance in understanding the correct algebra for the quantum system is the group theoretic quantization described in detail in ref .",
    "quantum mechanics on a circle serves as a simple example of this geometric quantization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the quantum mechanics formulated on a circle as formulated by ohnuki and tanimura emphasizing the features of importance to us . in section",
