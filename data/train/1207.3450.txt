    "the computational implementation of the scheme with weights ( [ 4.9 ] ) , ( [ 4.10 ] ) , which is unconditionally stable for @xmath115 , is associated with solving the system of difference equations for four components of the vector @xmath126 .",
    "the equations of this system are strongly coupled to each other , and this interconnection does exist not only for the spatial derivatives ( operators @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) , but also for the time derivatives ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "thus , we need to resolve the problem of splitting for the operator at the time derivative , too",
    ".    the simplest case is splitting of the spatial operator without coupling the time derivatives .",

    "the scheme ( [ 4.10 ] ) , ( [ 5.2 ] ) has the first - order approximation in time .",
    "it seems more preferable , in terms of accuracy , to apply the scheme that is based on the triangular decomposition of the self - adjoint matrix operator @xmath138 : @xmath139 for the problem ( [ 3.23 ] ) , ( [ 3.24 ] ) , we construct the additive scheme with the splitting ( [ 5.5 ] ) , where @xmath140 the main result is formulated in the following statement .",
