    "in recent years , metallic nanoparticles have emerged as potent catalysts for various applications  @xcite . in particular , the discovery that gold becomes a catalyst when divided to the nanophase has led to an intense research in this field  @xcite . in many cases the synthesis and the catalytic applications must be handled in the liquid phase , mostly in water .",
    "secure handling of nanoparticles in a liquid phase can be achieved by polymeric carriers that have typical dimensions in the colloidal domain .",

    "+ in general , diffusion - influenced reactions ( dir ) are ubiquitous in many contexts in physics , chemistry and biology  @xcite .",
    "however , while the mathematical foundations for the description of dir in simple systems have been laid nearly a century ago  @xcite , many important present - day problems , including the catalytic activity of composite core - shell nanoreactors , require considering complex geometries and multi - connected reactive boundary systems .",

    "it has been demonstrated recently that a key factor controlling the overall reaction rate is the transfer free - energy jump @xmath3 , a quantity that describes the partitioning of the reactant in the microgel versus bulk  @xcite . for a single nanocatalyst at the nanoreactor center , a free - energy jump at the solvent - microgel interface",
    "can be accounted for through a modified reactant density in the microgel , namely @xmath53 when crossing the bulk / microgel interface .",

    "otherwise , for @xmath84 , the chemical conversion step is slow enough compared to diffusion , which makes the reaction overall reaction - limited .",

    "+ formulas   and   have been derived in the monopole approximation , which means that any reflecting boundaries in the problem are not taken into account .",
    "therefore , these should be used to approximate the rate constant of a composite nanoreactor for small to moderate sizes of the central ps core . in the following sections , we provide a thorough characterization of the rate constant of a composite core - shell nanoreactor , computed exactly by solving eqs .  , and we compare it to the approximate moa analytical expression   in the physically relevant diffusion - limited regime ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "we now discuss in more detail the essential features of the diffusion - controlled rate in eq .  . in the monopole approximation ,",

    "the central core does not occupy a large fraction of the overall nanoreactor volume , with @xmath117 ( as taken from the experiments reported in ref .",

    "[ f : versusrs ] reports an analysis of the rate constant as the core sized is varied for different values of the geometrical and physico - chemical parameters . as a first observation ,",
    "the plots confirm and substantiate the discussion laid out in the previous section , as it can be appreciated that the core size does not influence the overall rate until @xmath120 .",
    "more generally , one can recognize that the rate constant tends to increase as the shell shrinks ( increasing values of @xmath121 ) .",
    "the only exception is for low @xmath2 and attractive transfer free energy , where a non - monotonic trend is observed ( top left panel ) .",
    "this is a typical screening effect  @xcite , which originates from the subtle interplay between diffusive interactions among the nanocatalysts and individual screening due the reflecting ps core .",
    "it turns out that the transfer free energy is the prime parameter that controls the increase in the rate as the ps core size increases .",
    "the more attractive the transfer free energy , the less marked the increase .",
    "interestingly , at fixed values of @xmath3 , the less mobile the substrate in the shell , the more marked the rate boosting effect of the shell shrinking .",
    "importantly , it is apparent from the plots reported in fig .",
    "[ f : versusrs ] that the role of the core size is reduced for loading number of the order of a few tens and small size of the nanocatalysts .",
    "all in all , these results confirm the complex intertwining of the structural , geometrical and physico - chemical features underlying the overall catalytic activity of core - shell nanoreactors .",
    "in this paper we have developed a detailed theory to compute the total reaction rate of core - shell nanoreactors with multiple catalysts embedded in the shell .",
    "the theory is utterly general and allows one to compute the overall reaction rate to any desired accuracy for ( @xmath6 ) given configuration , dimension and surface reactivity of the encapsulated nanocatalysts , ( @xmath122 ) size of the core and the shell , ( @xmath123 ) substrate mobility in the bulk and in the shell and ( @xmath124 ) transfer free - energy jump for substrate molecules .",
    "furthermore , we computed analytical expressions in the monopole approximation that provide an excellent interpolation of the exact solution for small to intermediate sizes of the central core in the physically relevant range of parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ small size and high dilution of the nanocatalysts .",
    "our formulas supply ready - to - use simple tools that can be employed to interpret and optimize the activity of experimentally realizable nanoreactor systems .",
    "this shall be particularly useful to estimate the optimal number of embedded nps , that should reflect a compromise between a resource - friendly design and the highest possible catalytic output .",

    "one gets @xmath129 of the order of hundreds , a value for which the monopole approximation is still in excellent agreement with the exact solution for core sizes such that @xmath130 . as discussed already previously , eq .",
    "makes it clear that a decisive factor in the design of optimized hydrogel - based nanoreactors must be the tuning of the reactant - hydrogel interaction towards attraction ( @xmath131 ) for a specific reaction ( or mix of reactions ) .",
    "furthermore , as hydrogel that cause strongly reduced substrate mobility also demand more nps to achieve high efficiency ( @xmath132 ) , the choice of the shell hydrogel should be made so as to privilege smooth longer - ranged interactions ( like electrostatic , hydrophobic , or dispersion ) with respect to short - ranged ones ( like h - bonds ) , in order to avoid too sticky interactions that would slow down the reactant mobility substantially due to activated hopping . +",
    "our analytical treatment breaks down if one wishes to push the nanoreactor performances towards full efficiency ( @xmath133 ) , where the loading number of np increases rapidly , or in the case of larger core sizes ( of the order of the whole spherical assembly ) .",
    "in such cases , the diffusive interaction between nps can no longer be neglected , as well as the effect of the inert ps core , as diffusive and screening interactions among the different boundaries become important . as a consequence",
    ", the full exact solution should be employed to investigate the behavior of the rate and elaborate an optimal design of the composite nanoreactor .",
    "interestingly , we have shown that , as a general situation , increasing both the core and the nanocatalyst sizes either has a rather mild effect on the overall performances , or , more generally , causes a rate - boosting effect , with an increase of the overall rate constant of up to 40 % for values of the core size @xmath134 .",

    "<S> we present a detailed theory for the total reaction rate constant of a composite core - shell nanoreactor , consisting of a central solid core surrounded by a hydrogel layer of variable thickness , where a given number of small catalytic nanoparticles are embedded at prescribed positions and are endowed with a prescribed surface reaction rate constant . besides the precise geometry of the assembly , our theory accounts explicitly for the diffusion coefficients of the reactants in the hydrogel and in the bulk as well as for their transfer free energy jump upon entering the hydrogel shell . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we work out an approximate analytical formula for the overall rate constant , which is valid in the physically relevant range of geometrical and chemical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in depth how the diffusion - controlled part of the rate depends on the essential variables , including the size of the central core . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we derive some simple rules for estimating the number of nanocatalysts per nanoreactor for an efficient catalytic performance in the case of small to intermediate core sizes . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical treatment promises to provide a very useful and flexible tool for the design of superior performing nanoreactor geometries and with optimized nanoparticle load . </S>"
