    "the purpose of this article is to prove a precise homotopical relationship between the category of @xmath4 algebras and the category of hopf algebras .",
    "by @xmath4 we mean the @xmath1 suboperad of the @xmath5 operad of mcclure  smith @xcite , called the sequence operad , or the surjection operad .",
    "classical results from @xcite ( theorems 3.6 , 4.4 , and 4.5 ) show that the cobar and bar constructions define an adjunction @xmath6 between coalgebras and algebras such that the unit and counit maps are homology equivalences .",

    "kadeishvili @xcite showed that the cobar construction induces a functor @xmath16 .",
    "this has also been generalized by fresse in unpublished work showing that the cobar construction induces a functor @xmath17 , which for @xmath18 reduces via the map @xmath19 to kadeishvili s functor .    from all of this",
    "a natural question arises : to what extent can one recover the @xmath20 algebra @xmath21 from @xmath22 ?",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath21 are equivalent as @xmath24 algebras .",
    "the conjecture is a classical theorem for @xmath25 , and remains open for @xmath26",
    ". the main result of this paper is a proof of this conjecture in the case @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the @xmath27 structure reduces via the map @xmath19 to an @xmath4 structure and so the statement is as follows .",

    "[ introthm ] if @xmath21 is an @xmath4 algebra , then @xmath28 and @xmath21 are equivialent as @xmath4 algebras .    instead of proving the theorem directly , we study the strict left adjoint of @xmath29 , denoted @xmath30 , and prove that there is a natural equivalence of functors @xmath31 .",
    "as we will show in section [ tildecobar ] , the theorem then follows from classical results .",
    "the theorem above of theoretical interest , as there does not exist a model category structure on @xmath32 , but according to mandell @xcite(section 13 , see also fresse @xcite ( part iii section 12 ) ) @xmath4 algebras do possess a _",

    "since @xmath34 is filtered by suboperads @xmath37 one can naturally ask : what homotopy information about @xmath36 remains if we just consider these `` simpler '' structures ?",
    "our eventual goal is to prove that for spaces that are sufficiently connected and relatively low dimensional , @xmath35 is equivalent as an @xmath4-algebra to a strictly commutative algebra .",
    "the idea is to study instead the hopf algebra @xmath38 and show that it is equivalent as a hopf algebra to a strictly commutative hopf algebra .",
    "this connects to work of anick @xcite , who showed that for certain @xmath39 algebras @xmath21 , @xmath22 is equivalent in a weak sense to a commutative hopf algebra of the form @xmath40 , the dual of the universal enveloping algebra of a lie algebra .",
    "we prove in the final section that @xmath41 is equivalent as an @xmath4 algebra to @xmath42 , the chevalley ",
    "eilenberg cochain complex .",
    "this shows that if @xmath22 is equivalent as a hopf algebra to some @xmath40 , then @xmath21 is equivalent as an @xmath4 algebra to a commutative algebra .",
    "we will show in a future paper that for spaces @xmath36 as above , @xmath38 is equivalent as a hopf algebra to @xmath43 , thus @xmath35 is equivalent as an @xmath4-algebra to @xmath44 which is a strictly commutative algebra .",
    "we now briefly outline the structure of the paper .",
    "we enhance the classical bar and cobar constructions to functors @xmath7 , and @xmath16 , respectively , in sections [ barhopf ] and [ cobar ] .",
    "we then study the strict left adjoint of @xmath29 , called the @xmath4 cobar construction , @xmath45 and show that there is a natural equivalence of functors @xmath31 ; this occupies most of section [ tildecobar ] .",

    "in this section we establish conventions and sketch definitions for the notions used in this paper .",
    "let @xmath46 denote a commutative ring .",
    "our convention is that chain complexes @xmath47 will have differential of degree @xmath48 . sometimes , we use  upper grading \" @xmath49 which should be interpreted as notation for @xmath50 .",
    "we also recall the standard symmetric monoidal structure on the category of chain complexes . in particular , the tensor product @xmath51 , and the internal hom @xmath52 .",
    "we use @xmath53 to denote the linear dual chain complex @xmath54 . given a chain complex @xmath47",
    "we define its suspension @xmath55 to be the chain complex @xmath56\\otimes c$ ] , where @xmath56 $ ] is the chain complex given by @xmath46 concentrated in degree @xmath57 .",
    "similarly we define the desuspension of a chain complex @xmath47 to be @xmath58\\otimes c$ ] .",
    "the signs are determined by the koszul rule .",
    "we also define a map of chain complexes @xmath59 to be a _ weak equivalence _ if it induces an isomorphism on homology .",
    "we use @xmath60 and @xmath61 for simplicial ( or singular ) chains and cochains , respectively , with coefficients in @xmath46 . if the coefficients are @xmath62 , we use @xmath63 and @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath21 be a chain complex .",
    "we say that @xmath21 is an _ associative algebra _ provided it is equipped with maps of chain complexes @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 called multiplication , unit and augmentation respectively .",
    "the multiplication map is associative , the unit map satisfies unit conditions , and the augmentation is a homomorphism of the multiplication and unit maps from @xmath21 to @xmath46 . for brevity",
    ", we will usually use the term _ algebra _ for associative algebras , and we will specify if we mean some other kind of algebra .",
    "we can write the condition that @xmath67 is a map of chain complexes element - wise : for @xmath68 we have @xmath69 , this is called the _",
    "leibniz rule_. a map of algebras @xmath70 is a map of chain complexes that preserves the multiplication , unit and augmentation maps .    there is an obvious dual to the structure of an algebra that is important in this work .",
    "let @xmath47 be a chain complex .",
    "we say that @xmath47 is a _ coassociative coalgebra _ provided that it is equipped with maps of chain complexes @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , called comultiplication , counit , and coaugmentation , respectively . the comultiplication map is required to be coassociative , the counit map satisfies counit conditions , and the augmentation is a homomorphism of the comultiplication and counit maps from @xmath47 to @xmath46 .",

    "note that the counit is an augmentation of the underlying algebra of @xmath78 , and the unit is a coaugmentation of the underlying coalgebra .",

    "we will systematically use sumless notation in this paper . in particular , the ordinary diagonal will be denoted @xmath92 , and the reduced diagonal will be denoted @xmath93 .    a _ symmetric sequence of chain complexes _",
    "@xmath94 is a collection of chain complexes @xmath95 , @xmath96 , such that each @xmath95 is equipped with a @xmath97 action , where @xmath97 denotes the symmetric group on @xmath98 letters .",
    "a map of symmetric sequences of chain complexes is a collection of equivariant maps on each component complex .",
    "an _ operad _ is a @xmath99 complex @xmath100 together with composition maps @xmath101 @xmath102and a unit map @xmath103 satisfying appropriate associativity , equivariance , and unit conditions .",

    "a map of operads is a map of symmetric sequences of chain complexes that preserves the composition and unit maps .",
    "we will insist for the purposes of this work that the unit map is an isomorphism , and also that @xmath108 .",

    "a subcomplex @xmath110 of a @xmath100-algebra is called an _ ideal _ if @xmath111 whenever some @xmath112 . in this case the quotient @xmath100-algebra is well - defined and denoted by @xmath113 .",

    "an operad @xmath119 is called a _ hopf operad _ if it is equipped with a coassociative map of operads @xmath120 .",

    "we say that @xmath47 is an _",
    "@xmath119 hopf coalgebra _ provided that the multiplication map @xmath123 is a map of @xmath119-coalgebras .",
    "the associative operad @xmath124 given by @xmath125 $ ] is a hopf operad whose algebras are associative algebras , and whose coalgebras are coassociative coalgebras .",
    "furthermore , an @xmath124 hopf algebra ( or @xmath124 hopf coalgebra ) is exactly a hopf algebra .",
    "the commutative operad @xmath126 given by @xmath127 with trivial @xmath97 action , is a hopf operad whose algebras are commutative algebras , and whose coalgebras are cocommutative coalgebras .    since we insist that all operads @xmath100 satisfy @xmath108 and @xmath128 , we find that there is a canonical map @xmath129 of operads .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 itself is a @xmath100 algebra and a @xmath100 coalgebra for any operad @xmath100 .",
    "thus , it makes sense to speak of augmentations @xmath130 ( coaugmentations @xmath131 ) for @xmath100-algebras ( @xmath100-coalgebras ) @xmath36 .",
    "we will assume in general that all @xmath100-algebras are augmented , and all @xmath100-coalgebras are coaugmented .",
    "this is equivalent to working nonunitally , however for many purposes it is more convenient to have the unit or counit available . for clarity",
    ", we state this assumption separately .",
    "all @xmath100-algebras are augmented and all @xmath100-coalgebras are coaugmented . in particular , ( co)associative ( co)algebras are ( co)augmented .",
    "let @xmath100 be an operad , and let @xmath36 be a chain complex .",
    "we define a @xmath100 algebra @xmath132 as follows . as a complex , @xmath133 , with operad action given by @xmath134 we can interpret this as giving @xmath135 the structure of a monad on the category of chain complexes , and the algebras over @xmath135 are exactly the same as the @xmath100 algebras .",
    "note that because of our assumptions on @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath108 , @xmath132 has a natural unit and augmentation .",
    "note further that @xmath136 is a free @xmath100 algebra on the generating chain complex @xmath36 .",

    "an operad @xmath100 is called an _ @xmath20 operad _ if each @xmath137 is @xmath97 projective and concentrated in nonnegative degrees , and @xmath100 is weakly equivalent to @xmath138 as an operad , where @xmath139 is the topological operad of little @xmath140-cubes as defined in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "smith constructed an @xmath5 operad @xmath34 called the sequence operad , and showed that it acts naturally on simplicial chains ( as a coalgebra ) , and simplicial cochains ( as an algebra ) .",
    "smith also defined a complexity filtration @xmath141 such that @xmath142 is an @xmath20 operad , and @xmath143 is the associative operad .",
    "the elements of @xmath144 can be represented by formal linear combinations of non - degenerate surjections @xmath145 , where non - degenerate means that @xmath146 , for all @xmath147 .",
    "we will often write elements of this operad as ordered lists of integers , for @xmath148 the corresponding list is denoted @xmath149 .",
    "the complexity filtration can be expressed in terms of the number of times any given pair of integers switches order in the list .",
    "for example , @xmath150 has complexity @xmath151 and thus lives in @xmath39 .",
    "in @xcite , berger ",
    "fresse constructed another @xmath5 operad @xmath152 called the barratt  eccles operad , and an operad map @xmath153 , which is therefore a weak equivalence .",
    "the operad @xmath152 is given by simplicial chains on a simplicial operad given in arity @xmath98 by @xmath154 the standard contractible @xmath97-complex . the operad structure comes from the simplicial operad structure on the discrete operad @xmath124 .",
    "fresse also define a complexity filtration , coming from a filtration on the simplicial level , @xmath155 such that the map @xmath153 restricts to maps @xmath156 , which are weak equivalences of operads .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 is also the associative operad , so the map @xmath157 is an isomorphism . in addition , since each @xmath24 is given by chains on a simplicial operad , each @xmath24 is a hopf operad .",
    "the signs in @xmath152 are thus implicitly determined by the signs in the eilenberg - zilber map @xmath158 , and the signs in the chain differential . since the morphism @xmath153 is surjective , this implicitly determines the operad structure and the signs on @xmath34 .",
    "we should note that these signs for @xmath34 differ from the signs given by mcclure ",
    "smith in @xcite .",
    "we use these signs because the signs on @xmath152 are natural , and we would like the @xmath152 and @xmath34 algebra structures to be directly compatible . in @xcite ( section 2.2 ) , the authors give explicit formulas for the action of @xmath34 , with this choice of signs , on chains ( as a coalgebra ) , and cochains ( as an algebra ) .    note that we have arranged our conventions so that , for finite - type complexes @xmath36 , @xmath36 is a @xmath100-algebra if and only if @xmath159 is a @xmath100-coalgebra .",
    "similarly , for hopf operads @xmath119 , @xmath36 is an @xmath119 hopf algebra if and only if @xmath159 is an @xmath119 hopf coalgebra .",
    "we will occasionally switch between these dual points of view without explicitly mentioning it .",
    "the purpose of this section is to define and give first properties of the hopf algebra structure on @xmath22 , the bar construction of an @xmath4 algebra @xmath21 .",

    "now , in @xmath440 , @xmath439 is not contained between repeats , thus @xmath463 .",
    "we now make some observations about @xmath416 . by induction on the degree of @xmath440",
    "we can show that @xmath464 or it is a sum of sequences that have at least one integer that occurs at least three times .",
    "from this , it follows that @xmath465 on filtration level zero , since @xmath253 vanishes on such sequences applied to singletons .",
    "we now observe from the formulas for the action of @xmath4 on singletons in @xmath253 that , for the sequences appearing in @xmath462 , every integer occurs at most twice and if @xmath447 occurs twice then the subsequence between the two occurrences of @xmath447 is a singleton or of the form @xmath466 , for some @xmath98 .",
    "we can again prove by induction on degree that @xmath467 if @xmath440 is of this form , and thus @xmath468 on filtration level zero .",

    "thus , @xmath476 , and it follows that @xmath470 , and hence @xmath471 .",
    "since the map @xmath477 is an algebra map , and since we define @xmath416 from the left , we can show by induction on the degree of @xmath440 that @xmath416 is a derivation homotopy from @xmath57 to @xmath477 on filtration level zero , that is @xmath478 .",
    "we assume that @xmath440 can be subdivided into two sequences @xmath479 , @xmath480 such that @xmath481 , we assume that @xmath482 , \\ldots , [ c_k])$ ] and @xmath483 , \\ldots , [ c_k])$ ] , and thus @xmath484 , \\ldots , [ c_k])$ ] .",
    "if @xmath479 contains no repeats , then @xmath467 and the formula is clear .",

    "now , by induction we have the following , @xmath489 @xmath490 the terms @xmath491 give @xmath492 , the term @xmath493 gives @xmath494 , and the rest of the terms will vanish after applying @xmath495 to the corresponding operation .",

    "it follows from naturality that @xmath498 , \\ldots , [ c_k])$ ] is in filtration level @xmath140 .",

    "thus , we have @xmath504 finally , induction and similar arguments to those given above show that @xmath416 is a derivation homotopy satisfying ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "let s trace through the first non - trivial example to see how the homotopy works ; we work with @xmath505 to avoid the signs .",
    "consider @xmath506 , [ c_2 ] , [ c_3])$ ] , where @xmath507 are all primitive , and we let @xmath508 .",
    "then , we have @xmath509 , but @xmath510 [ c_3 ] + [ c_2][c_1 c_3 ] = ( ( 1,2,1,3)+ ( 2,1,3,1))([c_1 ] , [ c_2 ] , [ c_3]),\\ ] ] and thus @xmath511 , [ c_2 ] , [ c_3])$ ] , and so @xmath512 , @xmath513 and @xmath514 , and therefore @xmath515 .",

    "in this section , we assume that @xmath517 .    the purpose of this section is to prove that , up to homotopy , @xmath41 is commutative as an @xmath4 algebra .",
    "the purpose for this is first , to give a nice application of the machinery introduced above , and second , to study @xmath35 as an @xmath4 algebra , where @xmath36 is finite - type . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we prove that under certain assumptions on @xmath36 that @xmath38 is equivalent to @xmath518 as a hopf algebra .",
    "it will then follow from theorem [ barthm ] , and this section , that under these assumptions @xmath35 is equivalent as an @xmath4 algebra to @xmath44 ( the chevalley - elilenberg cochain complex on the lie algebra @xmath519 ) , which is a commutative algebra .",
    "let @xmath520 be a connected , finite - type , nonnegatively graded differential graded lie algebra .",

    "consider @xmath521 , and define @xmath522 to be the largest cocommutative subcoalgebra that contains @xmath523 as its primitives ; this is the well - known chevalley ",
    "eilenberg cochain complex .",
