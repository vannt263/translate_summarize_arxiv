    "yvonne choquet - bruhat has made fundamental contributions to the study of both hyperbolic pdes ( notably her work in proving the well - posedness of the cauchy problem for einstein s gravitational field equations ) and elliptic pdes ( we cite here her foundational work on the conformal method for studying the einstein constraint equations ) .",
    "we ( ji ) have had the delightful privilege of knowing yvonne for over 40 years , of working with her on a wide variety of projects over the last 35 years , and of counting her as a close friend . in the spirit of this collaboration and friendship , and with an eye on yvonne s wonderful adventurousness",
    ", we offer here a brief survey of a geometric heat flow of relatively recent interest which is related to ricci flow , and has its roots in physics .    during the 1960 s",
    ", gell - mann and levy introduced a class of quantum field theories which they labeled  nonlinear sigma models \" @xcite .",
    "these quantum field theories are based on maps @xmath2 ( for @xmath3 a riemannian surface , and for @xmath4 a riemannian manifold ) and the corresponding harmonic map functional @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is a positive constant . ) the analysis of the nonlinear sigma model quantum field theories involves the choice of certain  cut - offs \" , and it is important for the plausibility of the theories as tools for physical prediction that their predictions not change under rescaling of the cutoffs . to achieve this",
    ", physicists generally deform the metric @xmath7 along with the deformation of the cutoff scale .",
    "using @xmath8 to parametrize these deformations , physicists call the evolution of @xmath9 the  renormalization group flow .",
    "\" renormalization is an essential concept in theoretical physics ; see @xcite for a short intuitive introduction , and see @xcite for an overview of the physics of the renormalization group flow for the nonlinear sigma model .",
    "a comprehensive introduction can be found in the lecture notes @xcite,@xcite . despite its importance in physics",
    ", the renormalization group flow does not appear in the literature as an explicit pde system for the evolution @xmath9 of the metric .",
    "rather , what one finds are perturbative ( in @xmath6 ) expansions of the flow system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first order truncation produces the celebrated ricci flow @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ricci curvature tensor , the trace of the full curvature tensor .",
    "( this in turn can be thought of as the collection of the gaussian curvatures of 2-dimensional subspaces of the manifold .",
    "the ricci flow was introduced to the mathematics community in 1982 by richard hamilton , who laid out a program to use it to verify the thurston s geometrization conjecture .",
    "although his program was essentially completed by perelman in 2003 , the study of ricci flow continues to be an extremely active area of mathematics @xcite , and its effectiveness as a tool for attacking important problems in geometry has been remarkable ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , one of perelman s key results is the demonstration that the ricci flow is a gradient flow , and he credits his energy functional formulation of this flow to ideas arising in the quantum field theory literature .",
    "physicists have used the ricci flow as an approximation of the full renormalization group flow .",
    "the question of whether or not this is a good approximation naturally arises , and one way to address this issue is to study the expansion truncated at the second term ; one obtains the 2-loop renormalization group flow equation ( which we label  rg-2 flow \" ) , which takes the following form : @xmath12 here , the quadratic riemann term on the right hand side is given explicitly ( in index form ) by @xmath13 so this flow involves the full curvature tensor .",
    "we note that this @xmath14 term is familiar to mathematicians , arising in the study of einstein manifolds ( see @xcite , definition 1.131 , and also @xcite ) .",
    "only recently has there been much attention given to the mathematical nature of the rg-2 flow system and its solutions .",
    "this is partly because , unlike other well - studied geometric heat flows such as ricci flow and mean curvature flow , the rg-2 flow is not a weakly parabolic system . it _ is _ the case that rg-2 flow , like the others , is diffeomorphism - covariant in the sense that if @xmath9 is a solution with initial condition @xmath15 , then @xmath16 is also a solution ( since @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . as a consequence of this feature ,",
    "none of these flows are _ strictly _ parabolic . for ricci flow , either by restricting diffeomorphism freedom or by working with the diffeomorphically - related deturck flow , one can effectively turn the flow equations into a parabolic pde system . this does not work for rg-2 flow .",
    "one sees this by noting that the imposition of a coordinate condition like  harmonic coordinates \" , which results in ricci flow appearing to take parabolic form , does not do the same for rg-2 flow .",
    "there are special cases in which rg-2 flow is weakly parabolic : oliynyk shows in @xcite that in two dimensions the rg-2 flow is ( weakly ) parabolic assuming @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the gaussian curvature . for surfaces of euler characteristic @xmath21",
    "he finds subspaces of the space of smooth riemannian metrics that are invariant under the flow , and for which the flow stays parabolic ( or , alternatively , backwards parabolic ) .",
    "cremaschi and mantegazza prove the analogous parabolicity result in 3 dimensions ( see @xcite ) , where the curvature condition is @xmath22 for all sectional curvatures @xmath23 we have recently proved that an analogous result holds in all dimensions ( see @xcite ) :    [ ndim ] let @xmath24 be a closed @xmath25-dimensional riemannian manifold . if @xmath22 for all sectional curvatures @xmath0 , then there exists a unique solution @xmath9 of the initial value problem @xmath26 , @xmath15 , on some time interval @xmath27    a superficial inspection of the rg-2 flow equation - suggests that the second term is important for a given solution if and only if the norm of the curvature approaches the value @xmath28 .",
    "the results noted above concerning weak parabolicity support this contention . in our discussion of various special solutions",
    "below , we note further concrete evidence for it , in the form of families of solutions ( defined by isometries ) for which a portion of the rg-2 solutions ( those with positive curvature , or curvature not too negative with respect to @xmath28 ) behave very similarly to solutions of ricci flow , while a complementary portion of the rg-2 solutions ( those with large negative curvature ) behave qualitatively very differently .",
    "the relative size of the curvature and @xmath28 also determines whether the evolution of the volume element @xmath29 is similar to or different from that of the ricci flow .",
    "the volume element evolves according to @xmath30where @xmath31 is the scalar curvature ( defined to be the trace of the ricci curvature tensor ) . if @xmath32 the volume decreases . in the @xmath33 case , one can have @xmath34 positive or negative ( in contrast to the ricci flow ) , depending on the relative size of @xmath28 and the curvature .",
    "note that one can use to construct a volume - normalized version of rg-2 flow : @xmath35 there do not appear to be any studies of this volume - normalized flow in the literature .    for a relatively new and relatively unstudied geometric heat flow system like rg-2 flow , one of the more useful ways to begin to understand it is to examine special classes of solutions .",
    "we do that here , starting in section [ fixedpoints ] with fixed point solutions .",
    "we proceed in section [ constcurv ] to review results concerning solutions of the rg-2 flow which have constant curvature . in section [ solitons ]",
    "we discuss rg-2 solitons , and in section [ lochomog ] we review results concerning rg-2 flow restricted to the class of locally homogeneous geometries .",
    "we conclude this work ( see section [ open ] ) by stating a number of outstanding open problems concerning rg-2 flow and its solutions .",
    "the fixed points of any dynamical system are those solutions which do not change in time ; hence for rg-2 flow they are those geometries for which the right hand side of vanishes : @xmath36 = -\\frac{\\alpha}{4}rm^2[g].\\ ] ] not surprisingly , in view of this equation , the fixed points which are known are metrics with negative ricci curvature .    in dimension two , equation reduces to the condition that the curvature be constant and negative .",
    "such geometries  the hyperbolic surfaces  are well understood . in dimension three ,",
    "the analysis is a bit more involved , but we are still able to determine the complete set of rg-2 fixed points .",
    "the starting point for this analysis is to recall that in three dimensions , the riemann curvature tensor can be written strictly in terms of the ricci tensor .",
    "it follows that the rg-2 fixed point equation can be rewritten ( in index form ) as follows : @xmath37    since the ricci curvature tensor @xmath38 is a symmetric tensor , one can diagonalize it at a point , in terms of an orthonormal basis . using @xmath39 to label the eigenvalues of the ricci tensor under this diagonalisation",
    ", one can rewrite the fixed point condition as a system of three ( quadratic ) algebraic equations for these eigenvalues .",
    ": @xmath40 after some calculation , one finds that these equations admit the following four distinct solutions , and no others : @xmath41    each of these four solutions for @xmath39 specifies a set of constant values for the three ricci tensor eigenvalues .",
    "since the ricci curvature tensor diagonalisation can be done at any point , each of these consequently specifies a geometry ( or set of geometries ) of specified constant ricci curvature .",
    "hence we obtain four distinct ( sets of ) fixed point geometries for rg-2 flow .",
    "we contrast this with the set of fixed points for ricci flow , which ( in all dimensions ) comprise the ricci flat geometries only .",
    "constant ricci curvature geometries are known as  einstein spaces \" . in three dimensions , since the ricci curvature controls the full geometry , they are  constant curvature homogeneous spaces \" . noting that in three dimensions , the eigenvalues of the sectional curvatures are given by @xmath42 we readily determine that the fixed points 1 ) , 2 ) , and 3 ) correspond to @xmath43 @xmath44 , and @xmath45 the fixed point described by @xmath46 is less understood .",
    "we note in particular that it follows from proposition 5.1 in @xcite exists if the curvatures satisfy at least one of the following ( partially overlapping ) three sets of conditions : i ) all are equal , or two are equal and the last is zero ; ii ) @xmath47 , or at least two of them are zero ; iii)all are non - positive , at most one is zero , and up to re - numeration satisfy the inequalities @xmath48 @xmath49 . ]",
    "that geometries satisfying this condition can not be locally homogeneous .",
    "are these fixed points of rg-2 flow stable ?",
    "results in @xcite show that at least some of them are . in that work ,",
    "maximal regularity techniques are used to show that , as is the case for ricci flow , the flat torus ( fixed point 1 ) is stable , and in particular there exists an exponentially attractive center manifold composed entirely of flat metrics .",
    "also in that paper , it is shown that given _ any _ hyperbolic space of any constant curvature @xmath50 , one can modify the rg-2 flow by scaling so that the space is a fixed point of the modified flow , and one can show stability if @xmath51 is not too negative .",
    "as noted previously , to be physically meaningful one requires @xmath52 .",
    "however , mathematically one can assume @xmath53 . from @xcite",
    ", one sees that the fixed point @xmath54 in the @xmath55 case is indeed locally homogeneous , and one also recovers @xmath56 and @xmath57 as fixed points under this assumption .",
    "among the simplest collection of solutions to the rg-2 flow , besides the fixed points , are those with constant curvature .",
    "we recall that it follows from diffeomorphism invariance and the uniqueness of solutions for the ricci flow initial value problem that isometries of the initial metric @xmath58 are preserved along ricci flow solutions @xmath9 . for rg-2 flow , diffeomorphism invariance holds , but uniqueness has not been generally proven ( see theorem [ ndim ] for a special case where it is known ) . hence , there is no proof that isometries are preserved along rg-2 flow .",
    "we can , however , focus on those constant curvature solutions such that indeed the constant curvature condition is preserved .",
    "this leads us to consider solutions of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes a fixed constant curvature metric ( of curvature @xmath20 ) .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , the rg-2 flow for evolving metrics of the form implies that @xmath61 must satisfy the equation @xmath62 one readily determines that this ode is solved implicitly by functions @xmath61 which satisfy @xmath63 where @xmath25 denotes the dimension of the space .    using this implicit expression ,",
    "one may seek times @xmath64 such that @xmath65 vanishes : one verifies that for @xmath20 not equal to either zero or @xmath66 ( these values correspond to rg-2 fixed points , as discussed above ) , one has @xmath67 for @xmath68 for those values of @xmath20 for which this expression for @xmath64 is a positive real ( finite ) number , we see that the corresponding constant curvature rg-2 solution becomes singular in finite time . to survey what in fact holds for various choices of @xmath20 , it is useful to note that the implicit solutions @xmath61 of are given by the ",
    "lambert w function \" , denoted by @xmath69 , which is defined to be the ( multivalued ) inverse of the map @xmath70 , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 denoting specific branch choices ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we now list the behavior of the rg-2 flow for the various choices of the constant curvature @xmath20 :    1 .",
    "@xmath73 : this is a fixed point in all dimensions . 2 .",
    "@xmath74 : the constant curvature sphere collapses to a point in finite time , with the time to extinction ( given by the value of @xmath64 in , which for @xmath75 is positive real ) less than the corresponding collapse time for spheres evolving under ricci flow . as an explicit example , if @xmath1 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 one has the solution @xmath78 3",
    ".   @xmath79 , and @xmath80 : constant negative curvature spaces , with curvature very negative , collapse to a point in finite time @xmath64 .",
    "for example letting @xmath1 , @xmath76 and @xmath81 one has the function @xmath82 , which is real until the extinction time @xmath64 ( given by above ) .",
    "this behavior of hyperbolic geometries under rg-2 flow differs from that under ricci flow , in that the latter continues to expand for all time .",
    "@xmath79 , and @xmath83 : for constant negative curvature spaces with small curvature , the rg-2 flow geometry initially expands , and in fact continues to expand for all time , just as is the case under ricci flow .",
    "for example , if @xmath1@xmath76 and @xmath84 one has the solution @xmath85 which behaves monotonically .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath86 this is a fixed point in all dimensions . in dimension 3 , this corresponds to the case @xmath87 , since @xmath88 .",
    "note that for any fixed value of the coupling constant @xmath6 , if one chooses the value of @xmath20 to be sufficiently negative , the behavior under the rg-2 flow differs from that under ricci flow .",
    "fixed point solutions of rg-2 flow do not evolve , and the constant curvature solutions discussed above evolve only by scaling .",
    "more generally , solutions that evolve only by scaling and diffeomorphism ( i.e. , those which evolve self - similarly ) , are called _",
    "solitons_. for @xmath89 they are called _ shrinking solitons _",
    ", for @xmath90 they are _ expanding solitons _ , and for @xmath91 , they are called _",
    "steady solitons_. in the study of ricci flow and other geometric heat flows , solitons have proven to be very useful both for modeling the behavior of singularities and for modeling long - time ( non - singular ) behavior of solutions of the flows .",
    "indeed , a commonly used technique for analyzing and classifying the geometry of singularities in ricci flow solutions is to generate a sequence of flow solutions by scaling in space and time about the singularity , and then studying the limits of these sequences and relating them to solitons .",
    "solitons have also been used to find so - called harnack inequalities , which can be very helpful in comparing solution values at different times .",
    "harnack inequalities are generally sharp for solitons .",
    "while rg-2 solitons have only recently been considered , and much is unknown concerning them , we have learned some facts about them , as surveyed here .",
    "since the rg-2 equation is not scale - invariant , the possible soliton solutions with @xmath92 not constant and with no evolution by diffeomorphism ",
    "i.e . , those for which @xmath93 for some specified initial metric is a general initial metric , not necessarily one of constant curvature as in section [ constcurv ] . ] are very restricted .",
    "we express this in the following classification theorem :    [ solnodiff ] let @xmath24 be a closed riemannian manifold .",
    "if @xmath9 is a solution of the rg-2 flow such that @xmath93 , with @xmath94 not constant , then @xmath24 is an einstein manifold and @xmath95 .    calculating the right hand side of the rg-2 flow equation for metrics of the form @xmath93",
    ", we obtain @xmath96 it then follows that @xmath9 is an rg-2 flow solution if and only if @xmath92 and @xmath58 satisfy the following tensor equation : @xmath97    since the tensors @xmath11 and @xmath14 are both symmetric , we can diagonalize the left hand side of with respect to an orthonormal basis . labeling the eigenvalues",
    "( with respect to this diagonalization ) of @xmath11 as @xmath98 and those of @xmath14 as @xmath99 , we obtain the system @xmath100 if we now subtract , for example , the first two equations , we have @xmath101 if @xmath94 is not constant , we must have @xmath102 and @xmath103 arguing similarly , we determine that @xmath104 , and @xmath105    thus @xmath106 , for some function @xmath107 , and it is then a consequence of schur s lemma , if @xmath108 for all @xmath109 , then the metric is einstein . ] that the metric is einstein .",
    "we also have @xmath110 for some function @xmath111 . taking the trace of both sides yields @xmath112 ; hence @xmath113    for einstein manifolds in dimension 4 , it is always true that @xmath114 ( see @xcite , remark 1.133 ) . for higher dimensions ,",
    "the condition holds if and only if the metric is critical for the functional @xmath115 = \\int_m |rm|^2 d\\mu\\ ] ] ( see corollary 4.72 in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that if one takes the divergence of both sides of the equality @xmath116 , one obtains the bianchi - type identity @xmath117    since a three - dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath4 is einstein if and only if it has constant curvature , we obtain the following as an immediate consequence of theorem [ solnodiff ] .",
    "let @xmath24 be a closed 3-dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "then there exists a solution @xmath9 of the rg-2 flow such that @xmath93 , with @xmath94 not constant , if and only if @xmath118 has constant curvature .",
    "a soliton that evolves by scaling and also by diffeomorphism has the form @xmath119 from which it follows that @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the vector field such that @xmath122 for every point @xmath123 . if @xmath124 for some function @xmath125 , then the solution is called a _",
    "gradient soliton_.      for a steady gradient soliton , it follows from the above considerations together with the steady soliton condition @xmath126 that at time @xmath127 , the metric @xmath128 and the function @xmath129 must satisfy @xmath130 one would like to show that , as is the case for ricci flow , if a metric @xmath58 on @xmath118 and a function @xmath131 satisfy ( [ gradsoliton ] ) , then there exists a steady gradient soliton @xmath132 with initial data @xmath133 .",
    "the proof of this result for rg-2 flow is much like that for ricci flow ( see for example ch . 4 , @xcite ) .",
    "we first define @xmath134 , and set @xmath135 to be the 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath136 we then claim that @xmath137 is a steady gradient soliton for rg-2 flow . to see this , we calculate ( for the left hand side of the rg-2 flow equation ) , at an arbitrary time @xmath138 , @xmath139 since , by definition , @xmath140 we obtain ( rewriting @xmath138 as @xmath8 ) , @xmath141 on the other hand ( for the right hand side of the rg-2 equation ) , we find @xmath142 we have thus shown that @xmath137 does satisfy the rg-2 flow equation , and is consequently a steady rg-2 gradient soliton .",
    "it of course remains to find solutions to condition .",
    "we now show that there is an rg-2 analog of the ricci flow cigar soliton ( known in the physics literature as witten s black hole ) and that its geometry is qualitatively similar to that of the ricci flow version",
    ".    the set - up in the proof below follows lemma 2.7 in @xcite .",
    "one can also set up the equations for the analog of the 3 dimensional bryant soliton , as in @xcite , chapter 3 section 4 .",
    "one writes the curvature tensor in terms of the ricci curvatures as in equation ( [ 3dfixpt ] ) to calculate the @xmath14 term .    in the proof of theorem [ cigar ] ,",
    "if one instead takes @xmath73 , one obtains the flat metric .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath50 , then the constant @xmath143 in equation ( [ f ] ) is negative , and the solution of equation ( [ phi  ] ) approximates the ricci flow soliton of negative curvature @xmath144 , where @xmath145    [ cigar ] there exists a unique rotationally symmetric 2-dimensional steady rg-2 gradient soliton of constant positive curvature @xmath146    we seek rotationally symmetric metrics of the form @xmath147 together with functions @xmath148 which satisfy the initial value soliton equation @xmath149 here @xmath150 and is presumed smooth . in order for the metric to extend smoothly over the origin , we impose the boundary conditions @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( the fact that these conditions are necessary and sufficient for smooth extension is proven , e.g. , in lemma 2.10 , pg . 29 in @xcite . )",
    "we choose the orthonormal frame field @xmath153 and using moving frames we calculate the curvature of the metric to be @xmath154 we then obtain the terms on the left hand side of the soliton equation by calculating @xmath155 from which we determine that the soliton equation takes the form @xmath156    to calculate the hessian on the right hand side of , we use @xmath157 and @xmath158 since @xmath159 with respect to the orthonormal frame @xmath160 , equation ( [ gencigsol ] ) reduces to the two equations @xmath161 combining these two equations we obtain the separable ode @xmath162 , which can be integrated ( with integration constant @xmath143 ) to produce @xmath163 the constant @xmath143 can not be zero since @xmath74 implies @xmath164 , from which we infer ( noting that @xmath165 ) that @xmath166 must have a sign . since @xmath167 , we see that @xmath168 and @xmath166 must have the same sign for all @xmath169 . since @xmath170 , @xmath168 and @xmath166 must be positive .",
    "it thus follows from ( [ f ] ) that @xmath143 must be positive .",
    "the soliton equation therefore takes the form @xmath171 equation is quadratic in @xmath172 , so we can solve for the second derivative of @xmath173 : @xmath174 here we choose the negative root since @xmath175 the associated equation in the ricci flow case is @xmath176 which has the explicit solution @xmath177 , with the associated curvature @xmath178    in order to see that has a unique solution , we set @xmath179 and rewrite as the following ode system : @xmath180 with the initial conditions @xmath181 we may write this as @xmath182    standard well - posedness theorems for ode systems ( see e.g.  thm 20.9 in @xcite and its references ) tell us that so long as the partial derivatives of @xmath183 exist and are continuous in a neighborhood of the initial values , then existence and uniqueness of solutions holds for this initial value problem . we readily verify that @xmath183 is @xmath184 for all @xmath185 .",
    "hence the initial value problem has a unique solution near @xmath186 , for the stated initial data , @xmath181 further , one can argue that solutions continue for all @xmath169 . to show this",
    ", we first argue that so long as @xmath187 stays bounded , the solution continues , with @xmath188 decreasing and staying strictly positive .",
    "the fact that @xmath188 ( starting at @xmath189 is a decreasing function follows immediately from .",
    "now , let us presume that there is some ( first ) value @xmath190 at which @xmath191 it then follows from that one must have @xmath192 . since @xmath183 is @xmath184 in a neighborhood of the point @xmath193 for any @xmath194 , and since it follows that the solution @xmath195 is the only solution consistent with the initial data @xmath196 , and finally since this solution is inconsistent with the initial data @xmath197 , we have a contradiction .",
    "hence , presuming the boundedness of @xmath173 , we see that there exists a unique solution with @xmath198 , constantly decreasing .    to argue that @xmath173 remains bounded , we consider the equation @xmath199 this is separable , and we can integrate both sides .",
    "one can see from the solution that as @xmath200 decreases to zero , @xmath173 approaches a constant .",
    "global existence follows .    to better understand the solution @xmath173 of ( [ phi  ] )",
    ", it is useful to consider the curvature @xmath201 at any fixed @xmath169 .",
    "expanding @xmath202 about @xmath203 we find that @xmath204 for example @xmath205 as @xmath206 since @xmath152 furthermore , for any @xmath6 we have @xmath207 as @xmath208 to see that , we recall that @xmath209 is positive and strictly decreasing .",
    "in fact , @xmath168 must decrease to zero , since if it were to approach some @xmath210 , then @xmath173 would be increasing and @xmath172 would be going to zero , so that @xmath211 would go to zero .",
    "but by equation ( [ curvatures ] ) , @xmath211 would approach a positive constant .",
    "hence , we must have @xmath168 and @xmath20 going to zero as @xmath212 in the following pictures , we compare the rf cigar soliton solution @xmath213 with the rg-2 flow cigar for small @xmath6 ( middle diagram ) , and for large @xmath214          the canonical metric @xmath215 in euclidean space is invariant under rescaling : @xmath216 , where @xmath217 ( @xmath218 can therefore be considered an expanding , shrinking , or steady soliton for the rg-2 flow .",
    "as a final example of a class of special solutions of the rg-2 flow , we consider the 3-dimensional locally homogeneous spaces . these are spaces such that for each pair of points @xmath219 and @xmath220 , there exist neighborhoods @xmath221 and @xmath222 that are isometric . in this case the spatial independence of the curvature results in the flow being a system of odes .",
    "the ricci flow on 3-d locally homogeneous spaces has been well - studied ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; solutions either develop finite time singularities , or exhibit characteristic `` pancake '' or  cigar \" singularities , where one ( resp .",
    "two ) direction shrinks and the others expand . in @xcite",
    "we explore the question of whether for fixed @xmath6 and for a fixed family of geometries , the rg-2 flow has asymptotic behavior similar to that of the ricci flow for these spaces . in the cases sol ,",
    "su(2 ) , and sl(@xmath223 ) , we set two directions equal so that the system is amenable to phase plane analysis .",
    "the conclusions we reach are consistent with the familiar theme that the behavior depends on the size of @xmath224curvature if negative curvatures are involved .",
    "more specifically , in the @xmath225 nil , symmetric sol , and symmetric sl(@xmath223 ) cases , one can choose @xmath6 sufficiently small so that the asymptotic behavior is similar to the ricci flow , and @xmath6 sufficiently large so that all directions contract , in contrast to the ricci flow .    for every fixed @xmath6 , one finds a curve that partitions the phase plane into two regions .",
    "solutions whose initial conditions start in one of the regions are immortal and demonstrate either cigar or pancake asymptotics consistent with the behavior of the ricci flow ; solutions whose initial conditions start in the other develop shrinker asymptotics with singularity developing in finite time .",
    "so , for every positive value of @xmath6 , no matter how small , one can find initial data such that dichotomous behavior occurs for the geometries with negative curvatures .",
    "there are many interesting open problems concerning the rg-2 flow :    1 .",
    "variational formulation : based on physical results the rg-2 flow should be a gradient flow ( see @xcite and @xcite for the ricci flow calculation )",

    "2 .   preserved curvature conditions : little is known about what curvature conditions are preserved along the flow . in particular it would be useful to find classes of initial data ( subspaces of the space of metrics ) , for which the parabolicity condition @xmath22 is preserved .",
    "singularities : we have seen that the rg-2 flow is not scale invariant , which is problematic in formulating blow - up arguments to study singularities .",
    "it would be useful to determine if blowup arguments in any form are effective for analyzing rg-2 singularities .",
    "harnack inequality : the derivation of a gradient harnack inequality for rg-2 flow could be guided by our understanding of solitons .",

    "physical applications : it has been postulated that the rg-2 flow should control the existence of a continuum limit , but we have not found a proof of this in the literature . briefly , one of the mathematically problematic aspects of this quantum field theory is that one needs a measure on the infinite dimensional space of all functions @xmath228 . one canregularize \" by approximating the domain with a lattice @xmath229 , so that the space of maps is @xmath230 .",

    "<S> the ricci flow has been of fundamental importance in mathematics , most famously though its use as a tool for proving the poincar conjecture and thurston s geometrization conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> it has a parallel life in physics , arising as the first order approximation of the renormalization group flow for the nonlinear sigma model of quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> there recently has been interest in the second order approximation of this flow , called the rg-2 flow , which mathematically appears as a natural nonlinear deformation of the ricci flow . </S>",
    "<S> a curvature flow arising from quantum field theory seems to us to capture the spirit of yvonne choquet bruhat s extensive work in mathematical physics , and so in this commemorative article we give a geometric introduction to the rg-2 flow .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of new results are presented as part of this narrative : short - time existence and uniqueness results in all dimensions if the sectional curvatures @xmath0 satisfy certain inequalities ; the calculation of fixed points for @xmath1 dimensions ; a reformulation of constant curvature solutions in terms of the lambert w function ; a classification of the solutions that evolve only by homothety ; an analog for rg - flow of the 2-dimensional ricci flow solution known to mathematicians as the cigar soliton , and discussed in the physics literature as witten s black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a list of open problems whose resolutions would substantially increase our understanding of the rg-2 flow both physically and mathematically . </S>"
