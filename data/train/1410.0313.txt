    "the remarkable phenomenon of tangential lipschitz gain for holomorphic functions was discovered by e. stein @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling his foundational result which states that a lipschitz-@xmath0 holomorphic function is lipshchitz-@xmath1 along complex tangential curves near the boundary .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smoothly bounded domain ( i.e. , bounded domain with @xmath3 boundary ) in @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath6 , let @xmath7 denote the complex tangent space to @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the set of holomorphic functions defined in @xmath2 .",
    "for a domain @xmath11 in euclidean space and @xmath12 , let @xmath13 denote the lipschitz ( or hlder ) space of order @xmath0 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath14    suppose @xmath15 . if @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , then @xmath18 such that , for any normalized complex tangential curve @xmath19 \\rightarrow \\omega$ ] and @xmath20 $ ] , we have @xmath21 a curve @xmath22 is called normalized complex tangential if @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a normal projection from a neighbourhood of @xmath8 to @xmath8 .",
    "this result is a striking example of the deep interplay between the function theory of holomorphic functions and boundary geometry in several complex variables .",
    "the key geometric fact driving this result is the following : for a point @xmath26 near @xmath8 , a complex disc centred at @xmath27 with radius @xmath28 can be fit inside the domain in any complex tangential direction .",
    "this translates to a better estimate for the rate of growth of the complex tangential derivative of lipschitz holomorphic functions which in turn results in a gain in lipschitz regularity in these directions .",
    "the hardy - littlewood theorem ( theorem [ thm : h - l ] ) provides the clearest indication of the close connection that is shared between the lipschitz regularity of a holomorphic function and the rate of growth of its derivative .",
    "we should note that the tangential lipschitz gain phenomenon is local in nature and the lipschitz gain reflects the local boundary geometry near a point on the boundary .",
    "also , the restriction of @xmath29 in stein s result is primarily to avoid the technicalities of dealing with lipschitz spaces of order 1 or greater . for more on such matters",
    "see the expository article by krantz @xcite .",
    "rudin @xcite showed a similar gain of lipschitz-@xmath0 to lipschitz-@xmath1 in the unit ball under weaker hypothesis and krantz @xcite has generalized rudin s result suitably to show the same gain on any smoothly bounded domain .",
    "these results that show a gain from lipschitz-@xmath0 to lipschitz-@xmath1 are sharp only for strongly pseudoconvex domains . a better gain is expected in the weakly pseudoconvex tangential directions since discs of larger relative radii can be fit in these directions and this translates to an even better estimate of the complex tangential derivatives in these directions . exploring this aspect of the tangential lipschitz gain phenomenon near points of finite type is the central theme of this paper .",
    "we will show that the gain is related to the non - isotropic nature of the complex geometry of the boundary measured by the relative size of discs that can be fit in the complex tangential directions .",
    "since holomorphic functions extend holomorphically past boundary points that are not pseudoconvex , it is natural to restrict our attention to pseudoconvex domains .",
    "furthermore , we will study one complex tangential direction at a time and formulate the lipschitz gain along complex discs in such a direction .",
    "results that show a lipschitz gain better than lipschitz-@xmath0 to lipschitz-@xmath1 are known for finite type domains in @xmath30 and convex domains of finite type in any dimension .",
    "krantz @xcite has formulated this gain on any smoothly bounded domain using an eisenman - kobayashi like metric and volume .",
    "chang and krantz @xcite have obtained an effective version of this result on pseudoconvex domains of finite type in @xmath30 showing that the gain is determined by the type of the boundary point , i.e. , a gain of lipschitz-@xmath0 to lipschitz-@xmath31 near a point of type @xmath32 .",
    "this can be achieved either by using the estimates of invariant metrics on such domains by catlin @xcite or by using the works of nagel , stein , and wainger @xcite , mcneal @xcite , and nagel , rosay , stein , and wainger @xcite .",
    "mcneal and stein @xcite have formulated this gain on convex domains of finite type in terms of the size of certain natural polydiscs .",
    "these polydiscs , constructed by mcneal @xcite , precisely capture the non - isotropic nature of the boundary of convex domains .",
    "our result is in a similar vein but we consider domains of finite type in any dimension that are not necessarily convex .",
    "we need the following definitions to state our main result .    for @xmath6 ,",
    "let @xmath33 denote the outward unit normal of @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "a real valued function @xmath34 is a defining function of @xmath2 near @xmath9 if it is defined in a neighbourhood @xmath35 of @xmath9 and it satisfies the following conditions : @xmath36 let @xmath37 denote the unit vectors in the complex tangent space @xmath7 .",
    "[ defn : rs ] for @xmath6 , a defining function @xmath34 of @xmath2 near @xmath9 , @xmath38 , small @xmath39 , and a choice of coordinates near @xmath9 , we define the following . @xmath40     and disc @xmath41.,height=99 ]    a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , note that , in the interest of readability , we have suppressed the possible dependence of @xmath42 , @xmath41 , and @xmath43 on @xmath9 , @xmath44 , the choice of coordinates , and the defining function in our choice of notation .",
    "however , we will highlight and comment on this dependence in our estimates and results whenever it is relevant .",
    "second , @xmath45 for any pseudoconvex domain @xmath2 , @xmath6 , and @xmath46 .",
    "but , the function @xmath43 satisfies a possibly better estimate when @xmath44 corresponds to a weakly pseudoconvex direction and @xmath8 has a finite order of ` holomorphic flatness ' at @xmath9 ( see proposition [ prop : rs_props ] ) . i.e. , @xmath47 , for some even integer @xmath32 that is less than or equal to this order of ` holomorphic flatness ' .",
    "in such a setting , @xmath43 is also the inverse function of @xmath42 .",
    "we use the notion of type introduced by dangelo @xcite to measure the ` holomorphic flatness ' of @xmath8 at a boundary point .",
    "the type of a point @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath48 , is the maximum order of contact of holomorphic curves with @xmath8 at @xmath9 ( see section [ subsec : fintyp ] for the definition ) .",
    "a related construct , the regular type , denoted by @xmath49 , is the maximum order of contact of non - singular holomorphic curves with @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "we are now ready to state our main theorem .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and let @xmath6 be a point of finite regular type . if @xmath50 for @xmath51 , then @xmath18 such that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , small @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the constant @xmath56 depends on the local geometry of @xmath8 near @xmath9 and can be chosen to be independent of @xmath57 and the choice of coordinates .",
    "the only dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath58 is on the lipschitz-@xmath0 norm of @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , if the regular type of @xmath8 is bounded in a neighbourhood of @xmath9 , we can choose @xmath56 to be independent of @xmath9 as well .",
    "notice however that @xmath43 depends on @xmath9 , @xmath57 , the choice of coordinates , and the defining function .",
    "the dependence of @xmath43 on the defining function is a red herring since the quotient of two smooth defining functions is positive near @xmath8 .",
    "dangelo also showed that finite type is an open condition , with an explicit bound , whereas finite regular type need not be .",
    "this gives us the following succinct corollary .",
    "we should bear in mind that the result holds locally near a point of finite type as well .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain of finite type in @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath59 such that , if @xmath50 for @xmath60 , then @xmath52 for @xmath6 , @xmath61 , small @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "we can generalize this result further by using a result of the author @xcite which states that a harmonic function that is lipschitz along a family of transversal curves near the boundary is lipschitz in all directions .",
    "we state this as a corollary and it is analogous to a result of krantz @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain of finite type in @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath62 such that , if @xmath58 is a bounded holomorphic function in @xmath2 and uniformly lipschitz-@xmath0 along a family of curves transversal to @xmath8 , for @xmath60 , then @xmath52 for @xmath6 , @xmath61 , small @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .    the article is organized as follows .",
    "some interesting examples that highlight the features and limitations of our result are presented in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "we collect some key results concerning lipschitz functions and facts about finite type domains in section [ sec : prelims ] .",
    "section [ sec : mainthm ] is devoted to stating and proving the main result of this article .",

    "then , @xmath69 for any @xmath6 and @xmath61 .",
    "notice that this ignores any information about the weakly pseudoconvex directions that @xmath8 may have at @xmath9 .",
    "hence , if @xmath70 , for some @xmath71 , then @xmath72 for @xmath6 , @xmath61 , small @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "herbort @xcite constructed the following domain in @xmath73 to show that the bergman kernel function need not grow like a rational power of the distance to the boundary function .",
    "our results have been inspired , in large part , by trying to gain a deeper understanding of the tangential lipschitz gain phenomenon on this domain .",

    "if @xmath50 , for @xmath77 , then @xmath78 for small @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath82 and we get the expected gain of lipschitz-@xmath0 to lipschitz-@xmath83 in the @xmath84 and @xmath85 directions but we only get a gain of lipschitz-@xmath0 to lipschitz-@xmath86 in the @xmath87 direction !    since finite type is an open condition , the lipschitz gain on discs centred below a point @xmath6 , close to @xmath88 , in a direction @xmath61 is given by , a different function , @xmath43 based at @xmath9 which does nt have as nice an expression as above .",
    "lastly , let us examine a domain , constructed by dangelo @xcite , that highlights the subtlety between type and regular type and also underscores the limitations of our result .",
    "[ eg : type ] consider the domain @xmath2 defined near the origin by @xmath89 this domain has the property that @xmath90 is a point of finite regular type but not a point of finite type .",

    "see section [ subsec : fintyp ] .    on this domain",
    "our result applies only to discs centred below the origin , on which we get a gain of lipschitz-@xmath0 to lipschitz-@xmath83 , but does not apply even to boundary points arbitrarily close to the origin .",
    "we wish to extend our understanding of the lipschitz gain phenomenon further so as to enable us to describe it in a full neighbourhood of the origin on this domain .",
    "the following theorem of hardy and littlewood provides an insightful characterization of when a harmonic function is lipschitz in terms of the rate of growth of its derivative .",

    "then , @xmath93 if and only if @xmath92 satisfies @xmath94    see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 and lemma 2.6 ) .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath92 is harmonic and lipschitz , the constant in the inequality above can be chosen so that its only dependence on @xmath92 is on @xmath95 .",
    "the following lemma shows that the derivatives of a lipschitz holomorphic function can be estimated in terms of the size of certain discs that can be fit inside the domain . in conjunction with the hardy - littlewood theorem , these estimates are at the very heart of the tangential lipschitz gain phenomenon and provide a bridge between boundary geometry and function theory of lipschitz holomorphic functions .",
