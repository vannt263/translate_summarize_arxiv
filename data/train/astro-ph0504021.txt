    "beginning with the detection of the hulse & taylor double neutron star @xcite , pulsar astronomers have unveiled a small but growing sample of double neutron star binaries over the last thirty years .",
    "owing to the extreme regularity of their radio pulse emissions , these exotic objects have proven to be invaluable scientific laboratories , particularly for tests of general relativity , as they are some of the few known objects for which the effects of gravitational radiation are measurable .",
    "in fact , the first confirmation that gravitational radiation existed was through measurements of the orbital decay of the first known double neutron star @xcite .",
    "recent surveys have started to unveil a better picture of the double neutron star population .",
    "the parkes multibeam surveys have discovered three probable double neutron star systems @xcite , and arecibo surveys have detected two more @xcite .",
    "although we are still dealing with small number statistics , the population is now large enough to see trends emerging .",
    "a phenomenon of crucial importance to the binary coalescence rate is the kick velocity imparted to a neutron star during its supernova , a dominant factor in determining the eccentricity and coalescence time of the subsequent orbit @xcite .",
    "binary neutron star formation and evolution also depends greatly upon this little - understood supernova kick , since a double neutron star system must survive two such kicks in order to remain bound .",
    "to some extent , knowledge of the kick velocity distribution can be extracted statistically from measurements of the observed sample of double neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the kicks can be inferred by the space velocities of pulsars , which are an order of magnitude higher than that of their progenitors , the ob stars .",
    "investigations of the pulsar population demonstrate that the average kick must be of order 400500 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "further evidence for pulsar kicks comes from precession effects observed in the binary pulsar psr j00457319 @xcite and spin - orbit coupling in the relativistic binaries psr b1913 + 16 , psr b1534 + 12 and psr j11416545 @xcite . assuming tidal forces and mass transfer",
    "align the spin and angular momentum axes prior to the ultimate supernova explosion , these systems suggest a kick out of the orbital plane has occurred .",
    "binary pulsars are in some sense fossil records of the progenitor system from which they evolved .",
    "we date these systems by the characteristic age of the pulsar , and can therefore extrapolate back to the orbital conditions immediately after the final supernova explosion .",
    "what prohibits us from going further back in time to derive a unique progenitor is the possibility that the newly - born pulsar received an impulsive kick at birth .",
    "since the kick velocity distribution is largely unknown , including its orientation with respect to any reference point , such as the pulsar spin axis , we are left with a rather unsatisfactory family of potential progenitors for any observed neutron star binary .",
    "the relativistic nature of these objects has brought attention to the galactic rate of double neutron star coalescence ",
    "the merger event at the climax of a long orbital decay and inspiral due to gravitational radiation .",
    "such events are some of the most significant anticipated sources of gravitational waves , detectable by interferometers such as the laser interferometer gravity - wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite .",
    "double neutron star coalescence is also considered a major candidate for explaining the origin of a subset of the mysterious cosmic gamma - ray bursts observed by gamma - ray observatories such as the batse instrument aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) @xcite .",
    "much research has been conducted into predicting the double neutron star coalescence rate , using monte carlo population synthesis models @xcite or by statistical extrapolation from the observed sample @xcite .",
    "monte carlo methods are currently hampered by the vastness of the population parameter space and compounded uncertainties , and statistical methods suffer from the small sample size of known double neutron stars .",
    "it is customary to estimate the event rate that advanced ligo will see by estimating what fraction of neutron star binaries we could have detected in pulsar surveys if they were of similar period and luminosity to those known , and assigning a `` scale factor '' to each .",
    "we then multiply each member of the population by their scale factors and obtain an estimate of the number of similar systems in the galaxy , thus obtaining a coalescence rate for the milky way that can be used to infer an event rate for the local universe by estimating the number of galaxies out to the ligo detection limit .",
    "we will refer to this method as the scale factor approach .",
    "whilst limited by small number statistics , the growing population of observed neutron star binaries makes us increasingly confident that coalescence is relatively common in the universe .",
    "the only alternative approach is to attempt to simulate the entire binary pulsar population .",
    "uncertainties in initial conditions and the physics of binary evolution and kicks mean that such estimates vary by more than two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the population synthesis method is therefore of limited use in estimating the merger rate .    for now , the coalescence rate is better estimated by considering the scale factor method , however when this is done we find the coalescence rate is dominated by the double pulsar psr j07373039a @xcite .",
    "this serves to demonstrate the heavy influence of small number statistics on the uncertainties in the scale factor method .",
    "the scale factor method also suffers from the extent to which the relativistic binary pulsar population remains invisible to pulsar surveys .",
    "for instance , if there existed a population of neutron stars that were completely invisible in the radio we would have no way to estimate their population from radio observations .",
    "similarly , if only 1% of recycled neutron stars emitted radio waves , we should multiply the scale factors currently in use by 100 .",
    "our best estimates of the inspiral rate require us to think of _ all _ the reasons why double neutron stars might be invisible to our surveys , and take them into account .",
    "what we explore in this paper is a selection effect that removes binary pulsars from our surveys and has received little attention to date .",
    "this is the production of highly - eccentric short - period binaries with very short lifetimes , produced via favourably - oriented kicks in the binary progenitor . these systems",
    "are not long - lived , and the coalescence rate of the scale - factor approach needs to be corrected for it . whilst this effect has been alluded to from time to time @xcite , we determine its importance for an arbitrary binary in the presence of a kick velocity that can occupy any of the phase space that will produce a bound orbit , as in this case the problem is scale invariant .    in this paper , we derive the expected distributions of orbital eccentricity for any surviving binary pulsar , if the kick velocity is capable of uniformly populating the available phase space after the explosion ( section [ sec : ecc ] ) . in sections [ sec : lifetimes ] and [ sec : eccevo ] we look at the lifetimes of the surviving systems due to gravitational radiation losses and identify a population of binaries that coalesce very rapidly .",
    "these results are used to explain the observed distribution of binary pulsar eccentricities ( section [ sec : observedpop ] ) , which at long orbital periods favour high eccentricities , and at low periods , small eccentricities . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we argue that the coalescence rate should be revised to take this into consideration , particularly for the double pulsar .",
    "in this section we examine the expected orbital eccentricities of relativistic double neutron stars from a purely analytical point of view , avoiding any assumptions about specifics such as the distributions of stellar masses , kick velocities and orbital separations .",
    "instead , we present a study of the potential eccentricities of an arbitrary double neutron star system in units scaled to the circular orbital speed , such that the conclusions drawn here can be considered common to the evolution of all double neutron star systems .",
    "indeed , all of our results also hold for any two compact objects ( black holes , white dwarfs or neutron stars ) where the final compact object ( a black hole or a neutron star ) is created in a supernova and receives a kick .",
    "we view the effect of kick velocity through a map of the second neutron star s post - supernova `` velocity - space ''  our representation of all possible relative velocities which correspond to bound orbits .",
    "the boundary of this velocity - space region is circular , with radius equal to the escape speed of the system ( @xmath2 in units of the circular orbital speed ) .",
    "each point in the map corresponds to one possible orbital velocity vector , where the position ( 0,1 ) would correspond to the circular orbital velocity .    to calculate the semi - major axis and eccentricity of an arbitrary binary ,",
    "we derive formulae from two expressions for the total energy @xmath3 of the system @xcite , and two expressions for the total angular momentum @xmath4 of the system @xcite :    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8^{1 \\over 2 } } \\label{eq : l1}\\ ] ]    here @xmath9 is the binary system s reduced mass , @xmath10 its total mass , @xmath11 its semi - major axis , @xmath12 its eccentricity , @xmath13 the magnitude of its relative orbital velocity oriented at an angle @xmath14 to the plane defined by the vector that connects the two stars , and @xmath15 the initial orbital separation . from these four equations",
    "we derive expressions for the semi - major axis and the eccentricity of an arbitrary binary , given the initial relative orbital velocity @xmath13 :    @xmath16    @xmath17^{1 \\over 2 } \\label{eq : e}\\ ] ]    these formulae are applied here to generate a contour map of eccentricities in velocity - space .",
    "note that the results are independent of the choice of @xmath15 .",
    "a code was written to uniformly populate the velocity - space region with grid points , then apply eq .",
    "[ eq : e ] to calculate the eccentricity corresponding to each grid point ( where each grid point represents one possible velocity ) .",
    "the 2d data was finally plotted as a contour map , and is presented here in fig .",
    "[ fig : eccmap ] .    .",
    "prograde orbits have positive tangential velocities .",
    "the circular boundary of the region represents the escape velocity of the system , which is @xmath2 times the circular speed .",
    "]    in interpreting this map , note that the relative velocity vector just prior to supernova would be a little larger than 1.0 in the scaled units used here , because of the larger stellar mass prior to supernova .",
    "( for example , a pre - supernova mass of 2.0 @xmath18 corresponds to an initial orbital speed of 1.102 units . ) also , for a sense of scale , note that the relative circular speed of psr j07373039a is of order 600 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we operate on the assumption that each system s final supernova is accompanied by an asymmetric supernova kick , which has the effect of displacing the initial relative velocity to a new position in velocity - space .",
    "this results in a new eccentricity and semi - major axis , which can be calculated using the new velocity and eq .",
    "[ eq : a ] and [ eq : e ] .",
    "we further assume that the outgoing supernova shell s impact with the companion has negligible effect .",
    "now , the most striking feature of the map in fig . [ fig : eccmap ] is the very small size of the low eccentricity regions .",
    "this is surprising , as the currently observed relativistic binaries tend to have eccentricities below 0.3 and therefore must have been kicked into a very specific region of their post - supernova velocity - space ( the third inner - most circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : eccmap ] ) .",
    "this seems an unusually fortuitous coincidence , requiring a very consistently precise kick .",
    "furthermore , with mean kick magnitudes of order 400500 km s@xmath1 , we expect systems to be highly prone to being kicked out of these tiny low - eccentricity regions in velocity - space .    the 2d eccentricity data generated for fig .",
    "[ fig : eccmap ] is presented as a histogram and cumulative distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecchist ] .",
    "here we have also provided eccentricity data for a 3d version of our planar velocity - space , uniformly populating a `` sphere '' of radius @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to investigate the effect of supernova kicks which are not restricted to the orbital plane .",
    "the eccentricity histogram clearly illustrates a heavy bias towards very high eccentricities in the planar velocity - space , with over 50% of all eccentricities",
    "greater than 0.8 .",
    "the distribution is less skewed when we allow for kick velocities out of the orbital plane , but the bias is still towards very high eccentricities .",
    "we assert that this illustrates a strong inherent tendency towards highly eccentric systems arising as a consequence of supernova kicks .",
    "this finding is not reflected in the number of highly eccentric relativistic binaries in the observed sample of double neutron stars , which tend to have low eccentricities .",
    "analysing this from the standpoint of kick velocities , the observed systems seem to have been kicked consistently into a very specific region of their post - supernova velocity - space , the `` bullseye '' seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eccmap ] .",
    "our explanation of this tendency is discussed further in the following sections .",
    "in this section we examine the probable coalescence times of relativistic double neutron stars , using a velocity - space contour map to illustrate dependence on the supernova kick velocity . as in the previous section ,",
    "we avoid assumptions about specifics such as the distributions of stellar masses , kick velocities and orbital separations , and present our results in units of the circular orbital speed and circular coalescence time ( the merger time for an arbitrary system with zero eccentricity , denoted as @xmath19 ) .",
    "these generic units have been chosen for their usefulness in comparing binaries in a scale - invariant manner .    in producing the aforementioned contour map of coalescence times ,",
    "we first generated a family of arbitrary double neutron star systems over all possible post - supernova relative orbital velocities .",
    "computationally , this was achieved by uniformly populating the `` velocity - space '' with grid - points , where each point represents a relative orbital velocity .",
    "these velocities were then used to calculate the corresponding semi - major axes and eccentricities , using eq .",
    "[ eq : a ] and [ eq : e ] .",
    "both of these factors will greatly influence the rapidity of each system s orbital decay , with close , highly eccentric binaries being much more volatile than wider , more circular ones . to compute numerical estimates of",
    "just how rapidly each system will coalesce , each grid point s initial orbital parameters were evolved forward in time by numerically integrating the coupled differential equations derived by @xcite for describing orbital decay by relativistic gravitational radiation .",
    "a runge - kutta 4th order algorithm was implemented with an adaptive step size , designed to integrate the equations forward to the precise time when the semi - major axis of the system drops to zero , thus determining the coalescence time .",
    "after iterating through all grid - points , the 2d coalescence time data was used to produce the contour map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coalmap ] .    ) as a function of orbital velocity immediately after the second supernova .",
    "only prograde orbits are shown , but the diagram is symmetric about the @xmath20 axis as for fig 1 .",
    "the time units are relative to the coalescence time due to gravitational wave emission for a system with a circular orbit . if neutron stars receive a randomly oriented kick after the supernova explosion that produces them , it is possible to populate the entire phase space shown .",
    "binaries with little angular momentum after the explosion are seen here to coalesce in remarkably short times relative to those in near - circular orbits .",

    "[ fig : coalmap ] is the large central region within which coalescence times rapidly drop from 0.1 @xmath19 ( in units of the coalescence time of a circular system ) to @xmath21 and even lower . to put this in perspective , for the orbital parameters of psr j07373039a / b",
    ", @xmath22 corresponds to a coalescence time of less than 1,000 years .",
    "[ fig : coalmap ] thus demonstrates that a double neutron star system which receives a supernova kick of the order of its circular speed has a very high likelihood of coalescing within an incredibly short timespan .    the cumulative distribution of coalescence times is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr_exist ] , which shows the uncoalesced percentage of the representative population as a function of time .",
    "this figure dramatically illustrates the high probability of rapidly coalescing double neutron star systems , with up to @xmath024% of all systems coalescing in less than @xmath23 ( equivalent to 8,500 years when scaled to the parameters of psr j07373039 ) .",
    "after just 0.1 @xmath24 about half of all systems have coalesced .",
    "this is an intriguing result , implying that the coalescence rate of double neutron stars is underestimated .",
    "these rapidly coalescing systems would be practically undetectable by modern pulsar surveys , since they would not live long enough to give sufficient opportunity for detection .",
    "they would , however , be detectable by gravitational wave observatories such as ligo , which will come online in the near future .",
    "we might predict that at short orbital periods there will be a deficit of highly eccentric systems because these are selected against due to their shorter lifetimes .",
    "we now investigate this in the following section .",
    "here we analyse the time evolution of the eccentricity distribution of a family of arbitrary double neutron star systems .",
    "the computation performed here is similar to that performed in the prior section  to begin , for every possible post - supernova relative orbital velocity ( represented computationally by uniformly spread grid - points in our `` velocity - space '' ) , we calculate an eccentricity and semi - major axis by applying eq .",
    "[ eq : a ] & [ eq : e ] .",
    "this results in a standard representative family of double neutron star systems , whose orbital parameters we can then numerically integrate forward in time using the coupled differential equations derived by @xcite . in this way",
    ", the eccentricity distribution of the whole family of possible double neutron star systems can be computed at birth , and at any time afterwards .",
    "[ fig : eccevo ] shows our resulting computed eccentricity distributions at three stages in time .    .",
    "the units are again in terms of the time it would take a circular system to decay due to gravitational radiation ( @xmath24 ) . after just 0.01 @xmath24 the eccentricity distribution ( dashed ) has flattened significantly as all the short - period , highly eccentric systems have already coalesced .",
    "after one complete circular coalesence time , the population of surviving systems ( dotted ) is much more uniform . ]",
    "this figure serves to illustrate the rapid coalescence of the vast majority of highly eccentric systems , which were produced in the greatest numbers when all possible bound orbital velocities were represented in our sample .",
    "this produces a rapidly evolving eccentricity distribution which changes on very short timescales ( 0.01 @xmath24 ) , and generally shifts towards lower eccentricities .",
    "while the initial post - supernova eccentricity distribution may be highly skewed , fig .",
    "[ fig : eccevo ] demonstrates that it does nt retain its shape for very long , quickly flattening out to a more uniform distribution , from which the observed eccentricity distribution of double neutron star systems could be more plausibly derived .",
    "here we will examine the observed population of double neutron star binaries , particularly in terms of the eccentricity distribution .",
    "[ fig : ae ] shows the semi - major axes and eccentricities of all currently known eccentric double neutron star systems residing within the disk of our galaxy .    ) binary pulsar systems residing within the disk of our galaxy .",
    "we have excluded pulsars in globular clusters , where the formation histories are quite different .",
    "relativistic systems ( those which will coalesce within a hubble time ) are indicated by dotted circles , and non - coalescing systems are represented by stars .",
    "note the comparatively low eccentricities of the relativistic binaries .",
    "pulsar information was obtained from the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite . ]",
    "the majority of relativistic binaries tend to have low eccentricities , which seems fortuitous considering the tiny size of the low - eccentricity `` bullseye '' region in the velocity - space as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eccmap ] . to achieve low eccentricities ,",
    "these relativistic binary systems would have had to receive consistently precise supernova kicks .",
    "any small deviation in kick direction or magnitude would result in higher eccentricities .",
    "our analysis of uniformly distributed pulsar kicks finds that surviving binaries should create mostly highly - eccentric systems .",
    "we contend that supernova kick velocities can easily be large enough in magnitude to kick a binary out of its small low - eccentricity `` bullseye '' and into the dominant , high - eccentricity region of velocity - space ( see fig . [",
    "fig : eccmap ] ) .",
    "these large supernova kicks can be inferred from the abundance of single pulsars roaming the galaxy at high velocities ( mean of order 400500 km s@xmath1 ) , most likely accelerated by supernova kicks . with regards to our simple kick model ,",
    "it is almost certain that the real kick velocity distribution would not _ uniformly _ populate the available phase space after a supernova explosion , as the kicks in close binaries would have to range from small velocities to higher than 1000 km s@xmath1 with equal probability .",
    "nevertheless , trying to guess the exact shape and magnitude of the pulsar kick velocity distribution leads to a plethora of models , and we resist this temptation .",
    "our ignorance of the kick velocity distribution does not invalidate our results , unless pulsars can never receive a sufficiently large kick , of magnitude similar to that of the original pre - supernova orbital velocity .",
    "we are inclined to assume that such large kicks can exist , however , as observed pulsar velocities suggest kicks may be imparted with magnitudes up to and exceeding 1000 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we propose that the observed population of relativistic double neutron stars exhibits low eccentricities because systems with higher eccentricities have coalesced before they could be detected .",
    "an average pulsar is detectable by modern pulsar surveys for approximately 10 myr  however , we have shown that binary systems have an appreciable likelihood of being kicked into coalescence within 1 myr or even less . not only will these systems coalesce rapidly , they will also have orbits so tight that the effects of `` doppler smearing '' are too strong for current search algorithms to detect them in some surveys . in summary ,",
    "the low eccentricities of the relativistic double neutron star systems suggest that a strong selection effect is in operation , and we claim that accelerated decay due to gravitational radiation is the cause .",
    "@xcite suggest that there is a correlation reinforced by the discovery of psr j17562251 between orbital eccentricity and spin period of recycled pulsars .",
    "our results suggest that many highly - eccentric systems resulting from close binaries are never seen by pulsar surveys , and that long - period binaries favour high eccentricities .",
    "close binaries transfer matter when the evolutionary timescale of the donor is still long .",
    "we therefore expect that short - period progenitors will be spun up to shorter periods than the longer - orbital period systems .",
    "a natural consequence of this is that the short - period high @xmath12 systems are selected against , that very few long - period low @xmath12 systems are born , and therefore a correlation is observed .",
    "we have seen that the binary pulsar population is missing highly - eccentric binary pulsars in relativistic orbits , which we attribute to their short observable lifetimes .",
    "the most reliable estimates of the merger rate of neutron star binaries come from extrapolation of the observed population , which ignores these missing binaries that we expect to be formed in large numbers before dying young .",
    "our calculations suggest that factors of several are required to correct the merger rate for these missing binaries .",
    "we have also shown that there is a non - negligible potential for coalescence times of the order of months if the pulsar kick is of the same order as the pre - supernova orbital velocity .",
    "this may mean that even relatively wide pre - supernova orbits can be driven to coalesce in remarkably short times by receiving an appropriately - oriented retrograde kick .",
    "this phenomenon could reveal itself in the form of a supernova followed closely by a second similarly - scaled catastrophic event ( the coalescence ) , where both would be observed at the same position a few months or years apart  what might be described as a `` double supernova '' .",
    "how soon after the original burst of star formation in the universe might we expect to see such an event ?",
    "population iii stars  the ancient stars which were the first to form in the history of the universe  may have often occurred in binaries where both stars underwent supernovae , subsequently taking part in an ultra - rapid coalescence which could be detected through gravitational radiation emissions ( the only known way of observing these objects , otherwise hidden by the epoch of reionisation ) . this idea has been alluded to before @xcite , however our findings emphasise the possibility that such a coalescence could occur very quickly after initial star formation , allowing future gravitational wave detectors to directly study events that occurred within the first few myr of star formation in the universe .",
