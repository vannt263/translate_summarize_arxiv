    "understanding impurity effects was one of the early , classical tasks for the theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the anderson theorem explained why non - magnetic impurity scatterers do not destroy conventional , isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductivity @xcite . for unconventional superconductors ,",
    "however , both non - magnetic and magnetic impurities are pairbreaking and the sensitivity to impurities and the concomitant suppression of superconductivity may even serve as a fingerprint of an unconventional pairing state .",
    "it took three decades after the development of the bcs theory of superconductivity , before experimental studies of impurity effects on microscopic length scales became possible  mostly due to the advance of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "the need for experimental probes with a high spatial resolution arose from the discovery of a continuously growing number of unconventional singlet and even triplet superconductors ; ruthenates and high - temperature cuprate superconductors belong to the most prominent examples .    during the last decade",
    "it has furthermore become possible to manipulate surface structures on the atomic level .",
    "in particular the achievements in the research group of d. eigler led to the design of closed atomic arrangements of adatoms on metallic surfaces @xcite . in these quantum corrals with circular or elliptical shape electrons are confined to well defined geometries and stm techniques were applied to explore the structure of quantum mechanical wavefunctions and their interference patterns @xcite .",
    "quantum mirage phenomena are observed , when an additional impurity atom is placed at one focus of an elliptic corral @xcite .",
    "the terminology of quantum mirages is hereby defined by the observation that mirror images of the local density of states pattern around the impurity at one focus point appear also at the second impurity free focus . in subsequent studies even kondo resonances could be detected at the impurity - free focus point , if a magnetic impurity adatom was placed in the other focus @xcite .",
    "similar mirage phenomena are expected for elliptic corrals on superconducting surfaces @xcite .",
    "the local suppression of the superconducting order parameter around an impurity at a selected point in the corral should be transferred to image structures due to standing wave patterns extending over the entire area of the elliptic corral .",
    "superconducting quantum corrals therefore provide unique systems to study the combined effects of impurity induced fingerprint structures of the pairing state and the mirage phenomena of interfering quantum mechanical waves . with the assumption that a superconducting state is established in the bulk and on the surface of the substrate material we discuss in this paper the expected phenomena within the framework of bcs theory and the bogoliubov - de gennes equations .",

    "for the elliptic corral we choose its eccentricity @xmath53 and the length of the semi - major axis @xmath54  ; these two parameters determine the single - particle eigenenergies and -states . with an approximate electronic density of one electron per 6@xmath556 square",
    "the total number of electrons in the corral is @xmath56 . with this choice",
    "the @xmath57 eigenstate at the fermi energy @xmath58 has a large probability density at the foci , which is a favorable situation for the occurrence of mirage phenomena .",
    "for an isotropic superconductor the mirage phenomenon is observed , whenever there is one of these non - zero probability density eigenstates lying inside the energy gap . for our choice of the pairing interaction strength @xmath59 the energy gap @xmath60 stretches over about 50 eigenstate energies , where several of these states have the required property .",
    "hence , the existence of mirage phenomena for an isotropic superconducting surface does not depend sensitively on the position of the fermi energy , in contrast to a metallic , normal conducting surface @xcite and also in contrast to an anisotropic superconductor , as we discuss below .",
    "we start our analysis with a corral on the surface of an isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductor . in the presence of non - magnetic impurities",
    "the system remains time - reversal invariant .",
    "these impurities do not break cooper pairs , which are built from kramers - degenerate electronic states @xcite .",
    "consequently , no additional states are created in the renormalized energy gap .",
    "magnetic impurities on the contrary , are pair - breaking defects , because the spin - up electron of the cooper pair is repelled ( @xmath61 ) and the spin - down electron is attracted by the impurity , leading to a quasiparticle bound state with a spin - down particle peak and a spin - up hole peak in the ldos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( dashed and dotted curves ) , where the impurity is located at the right focus of the ellipse .",
    "the ldos at the impurity site vanishes at the gap edge energies , while the ldos at the mirror point ( dotted line ) is finite at these energies . the total spectral weight of both peaks , i.e. the spatially and energy ( between the gap edge energies @xmath62 and @xmath60 ) integrated ldos is unity , characterizing one localized quasiparticle .",
    "hence , the bound state corresponding to the dashed line is a local spin - down quasiparticle state ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , unfilled triangles ) , where the spin projection of the particle component is antiparallel and that of the hole component is parallel to the impurity spin .",
    "this is the same phenomenon known for the extended @xmath0-wave superconductor without confining boundaries @xcite .",
    "the dash - dotted and dash - double - dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show the ldos for a stronger impurity potential .",
    "the difference now is that the spins of the particle and the hole peak have changed , i.e. we find a spin - up quasiparticle ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , filled triangles ) .",
    "this change is due to the fact that both peaks cross the fermi energy at a critical impurity potential strength @xmath63 .    in the corral geometry",
    "we observe the two - peak structure in the ldos not only at the impurity site e.g. at one focus point , but also  with some attenuation  at the impurity free focus ( dotted and dash - double - dotted lines ) @xcite .",
    "the mirage effect is only strong at one of the two peaks at the mirror point ldos . there",
    "the particle peak carries very little spectral weight for @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , dotted line ) , and so does the hole peak for @xmath65 . but with increasing @xmath66 the particle and hole peaks at the mirror point are both growing .",
    "we emphasize that the ldos peaks at the mirror point are at the same resonance energies as in the ldos at the impurity site , because they belong to the same bound state with energy @xmath67 .",
    "this is the quantum mirage effect in the ldos for an elliptic corral built on the surface of an isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "as expected , we find this effect to be very robust against a change in the fermi energy and thus the electron density .",
    "moreover this mirage effect remains almost unaffected by an additional perturbation in form of a second magnetic impurity placed anywhere else inside the corral .    since the bound - state peaks at energies @xmath68 , split off from the gap edges , they move with increasing potential strength @xmath66 symmetrically towards the fermi energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath67 therefore decreases until it reaches the chemical potential for a critical potential @xmath63 , which depends on the impurity position @xmath69 . at @xmath70 the bound state",
    "becomes a zero energy state , and the ground state of the superconductor becomes unstable .",
    "the existence of this critical point , which signals a ground - state level crossing transition , was first pointed out by sakurai for @xmath0-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities @xcite . at @xmath63",
    "the system undergoes a first order phase transition from a spin zero to a spin @xmath71 ground state @xcite .",
    "while the condensate ground state for @xmath72 consists only of cooper pairs , the new ground state for @xmath73 contains an additional spin - down electron ( or up - spin hole ) .",
    "the impurity induced bound state is now a spin - up quasiparticle ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , dash - dotted and dash - double - dotted curves and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , filled triangles ) . a further increase of @xmath66 in this regime ( @xmath65 ) is accompanied by a spatial shift of the ldos at the resonance energies away from the impurity position .",
    "this spatial redistribution of the spectral weight leads to decreasing heights of the bound - state peaks in the ldos fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] at the impurity position ( right focus ) and an accompanying increase of the peak heights at the impurity free focus .",
    "note that the total spectral weight of the bound - state peaks always remains unity .",
    "hence we observe a transition from a mirage - effect for small @xmath66 to an anti - mirage - effect for large @xmath66 .",
    "we compare our self - consistent solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation for a corral with the results for an open surface using the following formula for the bound - state energies @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the normal state dos at the fermi energy .",
    "( [ bsenergies ] ) is obtained from the non - self - consistent t - matrix formalism , which proved to be sufficient and even quantitatively accurate for the description of magnetic impurity induced bound states in @xmath0-wave superconductors without confining walls @xcite . in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) we use eq .",
    "( [ bsenergies ] ) with @xmath76 ( solid curve ) , where @xmath77 desribes the mean density of states averaged over an energy window @xmath78 in the normal state .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the bound - state energies in the elliptic corral are well described by eq .",
    "( 19 ) . comparing the self - consistent and non - self - consistent results for our corral , we find indeed only small differences : neither the quasiparticle energies are shifted notably nor the heights of the quasiparticle peaks are modified significantly .",
    "another interesting quantity is the renormalized local order parameter @xmath79 given by eq .",
    "( [ ops ] ) .",
    "we observe a suppression of @xmath79 at the impurity site , where the lengthscale of the suppression and the wavelength of the order parameter oscillations is given approximately by the fermi wavelength @xmath80  , but seems to be independent of the size of the energy gap @xmath60 .",
    "remarkably , the local order parameter at the impurity position changes discontinuously from a positive to a negative value , when @xmath66 crosses the critical potential strength @xmath63 @xcite . for a non - magnetic impurity",
    "the reduction of @xmath79 in the vicinity of the impurity is due to the repulsive potential for both spin directions resulting in a reduced electronic density at and near the impurity site and therefore to a reduced local pairing amplitude . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a magnetic impurity is placed at the right focus point .",
    "all one - particle eigenstates with a large probability density at the right focus have a large probability density at the left focus as well .",
    "the difference plot of the order parameter fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] strongly resembles the @xmath57 eigenstate , implying that @xmath79 is suppressed not only at the impurity site ( right focus ) , but almost symmetrically at the impurity free ( left ) focus , which we therefore call an order parameter mirage effect .",
    "we note that the order parameter is negative at the impurity site in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "if there are magnetic impurity spins in both foci , their antiparallel alignment leads to a lower ground - state energy eq .",
    "( [ grs ] ) .",
    "moreover we observe that the order parameter suppression is about six times stronger for a parallel than for an antiparallel impurity spin alignment .",
    "a parallel alignment leads to a four - peak structure in the ldos , because there are two similar states localized at each impurity , which are hybridizing and therefore splitting into bonding and antibonding states @xcite .",
    "if the impurity spins are aligned antiparallel , we find only two peaks inside the energy gap .",
    "the intensity of the hybridization depends in general on the distance between the two impurities ; for a corral geometry this dependence is quite complex .",
    "= 12.8 cm    = 12.8 cm      now we assume the pairing interaction @xmath81 to be attractive in a distance of a typical crystal lattice constant @xmath82 . in this case the order parameter @xmath83 depends on the position inside the corral as well as on the relative coordinate .",
    "although the interaction is still isotropic , the order parameter is now anisotropic . in fig .",
    "[ op1 ] ( left panel ) we show the order parameter in the center of the ellipse , where we identify a @xmath84-wave like structure with sign changes and nodes at angles near @xmath85 with respect to the semimajor axis . at the center",
    "the order parameter is least affected by the confining corral , but except for this point of highest symmetry , the structure of the local order parameter is distorted in a complex way .",
    "an example for a remarkably complicated symmetry and local structure of @xmath83 is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the spatially extended pairing interaction leads to a v - shape - resembling dos ( see fig . [ fig8 ] , solid curve ) , with no sharp gap edges .",
    "furthermore , the dos has no particle - hole symmetry , because of the asymmetric distribution of eigenenergies for the corral eigenfunctions .",
    "= 12.8 cm    = 12.8 cm    while non - magnetic impurities do not give rise to localized states in a @xmath0-wave superconductor , they do have a pair - breaking effect in an anisotropic superconductor @xcite . for a non - magnetic impurity placed at different positions inside the corral we calculate the local order parameter , the dos , and the ldos .",
    "in the dos we always find bound - state peaks , which move towards the fermi energy as @xmath66 increases , but never reach @xmath58 .",
    "hence , we do not observe a zero - energy - peak in agreement with the results for an open surface in a particle - hole asymmetric situation @xcite .",
    "the dos is modified over the entire energy range as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . for weak impurity potentials",
    "we observe a two - peak structure in the dos near the fermi energy , but after exceeding some critical potential @xmath86 , which depends again on the impurity position @xmath87 , each of the two peaks starts to split into two , so that a four - peak structure emerges near @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . at the resonance energies for small @xmath66 ( two - peak regime ) we find ,",
    "that the bound state has a large ldos in the vicinity of the impurity . by increasing @xmath66 the original bound state acquires admixtures of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 state @xcite . above the critical potential @xmath91",
    ", we identify the @xmath90 state either at both outer or both inner peaks of the four - peak low - energy dos , while the ldos at the two other peaks consists of the small @xmath66 bound state mixed with a contribution of the @xmath89 state .",
    "hence the splitting of the bound state energy corresponds to a `` demixing '' of the contributing states , which form the bound state .",
    "we observed this behavior at different impurity positions on the semimajor axis , but the occurrence of a four - peak structure nevertheless depends sensitively on the fermi energy .",
    "slight variations of the electronic densities can lead to two - peak structures in the dos , irrespective of the impurity potential strength .    in order to show a few of a large variety of interesting and astonishing effects we calculate the ldos in the presence of a non - magnetic impurity in particular at the right focus @xmath92 , at @xmath93 , and at the center ( 0,0 ) .",
    "interestingly , the important states ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) mentioned above are the only contributions to the bound state for an impurity in a focus point .",
    "these states have a zero ldos on the entire semimajor axis , but several maxima about a lattice constant away from the focus .",
    "this bound state shows an almost perfect reflection symmetry with respect to the semiminor axis .",
    "shifting the impurity a distance 1.5@xmath28 away from the right focus to @xmath93 , we observe that the ldos at the lower resonance energies @xmath94 has a strong contribution of the @xmath57 state and , as discussed before , a weaker contribution of the @xmath89 state .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the ldos at the positive resonance energy @xmath95 .",
    "while the ldos at the impurity site itself is zero , we observe a maximum in the ldos at the mirror point .",
    "the impurity induces asymmetrically spectral weight around both foci , whereas the height is larger at the left than at the right focus , which is close to the impurity .",
    "thus , we observe a surprising , strong anti - mirage effect in the ldos at all resonance energies with a non - magnetic impurity at ( 0.44a , 0 ) independent of the potential strength @xmath66 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the ldos with an impurity located at the center of the ellipse at the energy of the higher positive resonance energy @xmath96 .",
    "we identify the @xmath89 eigenstate again , which determines the region near the boundary of the ellipse and consists of rings of peaks aligned along four ellipses .",
    "the structure of the ldos in the vicinity of the impurity is in fact more influenced by the symmetry of the local order parameter than the geometry of the problem .",
    "e. g. in a range of a few lattice constants around the center there is no ldos along the diagonal directions , and locally there is almost a fourfold symmetry as for the absolute value of the order parameter in fig .",
    "[ op1 ] ( left panel ) @xcite .    in the vicinity of the impurity site the order parameter",
    "is reduced strongly by a non - magnetic impurity .",
    "this becomes obvious by comparing the right panels of figs .",
    "[ op1 ] and [ op2 ] , where the impurity is located at @xmath93 .",
    "moreover we observe here and quite generally a modificaton of the spatial structure and the symmetry of the local order parameter , which depends sensitively on the potential strength @xmath66 .",
    "interestingly the new , impurity induced spatial structure resembles more a @xmath84-wave - like symmetry than the original structure .",
    "[ op2 ] clearly indicates , that this @xmath84-wave - like order parameter structure is projected to the impurity free mirror point . instead of a reduction , the order parameter",
    "is actually enhanced at the mirror point . as in the ldos we therefore also observe an anti - mirage effect for the order parameter .",
    "the order parameter at @xmath93 is changed to a structure similar as in fig .",
    "[ op2 ] ( right panel ) , if an impurity is located at the center ( ! ) of the ellipse . in general",
    "we find , that the magnitude of the order parameter is not only reduced over the entire area of the corral , but also modified with respect to its local spatial symmetry .    regarding the connection between the spatial structure of the ldos in the vicinity of the impurity and the order parameter , we encounter three different situations .",
    "( i ) the ldos resembles the order parameter in the absence of an impurity , ( ii ) the ldos resembles the order parameter in the presence of an impurity , and ( iii ) there is no connection at all between the two . the latter is observed for example for a focus point impurity .",
    "we find the behavior ( i ) only for an impurity at the center of the corral , for large impurity potentials , and at positive resonance energies . for smaller impurity potentials we are back to case ( ii ) , where again the ldos shows the structure of the order parameter with an impurity only at positive resonance energies .",
    "this second case seems to reflect the more generic situation .",
    "hence , the ldos in the presence of a non - magnetic impurity inside the corral can directly reveal the structure and the local symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "we have observed a rich variety of mirage- and anti - mirage - phenomena not only in the ldos , but also for the local order parameter structure .",
    "the induced patterns in both quantities in the vicinity of an impurity lead to mirror images in impurity - free regions , which are characteristic for both , the structure of the electronic wavefunctions in the elliptic geometry and the nature of the superconducting state . with the continuing advances of stm techniques and the already achieved capabilities for the design of atomic corral arrangements on metallic surfaces the realization of quantum corrals on superconducting surfaces indeed appears to be possible . from our model analysis",
    "we are led to expect intriguingly rich structures in the ldos patterns , which by themselves contain information about the nature of the superconducting state .",
