    "in simulations of quantum many - fermion systems large statistical fluctuations arise due to cancellations among large amplitudes of configurations differing by fermion exchanges . as a consequence",
    ", the computational time required to obtain acceptable statistical errors grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "this limitation is severe because only small - size systems can be simulated and that prevents us from being able to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a general problem in several fields of computational physics and chemistry and it would be of general importance if a computational instrument that simulates quantum fermion systems could be constructed .",
    "progress in quantum computation@xcite has raised hopes that a realistic computation using a quantum computer could be achieved in the future .",
    "feynman had conjectured@xcite that the quantum computer can be used to simulate any local quantum system .",
    "later , lloyd showed@xcite that a quantum computer can be programmed so that it can be such a universal quantum simulator ( uqs ) .",
    "recently divincenzo et al.@xcite have proposed that a coupled quantum - dot pair may be used to represent a q - bit . however , in any attempt to design a general purpose quantum computer one needs to find an approach to externally manipulate quantum mechanical states , to preserve the quantum coherence of these states for some time and to transport them at a macroscopic distance away before the quantum information is dissipated .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the concept of a dedicated quantum simulator ( dqs ) in contrast to the uqs",
    ". it will become clear that a dedicated quantum computer to simulate a specific many - fermion model does not require a controlled initial state or building quantum gates which also need to be controlled .",
    "a dqs as defined in this paper , while it should be a system without significant amount of impurities or other defects which could create decoherence , it does not require from us to manipulate q - bits where destruction of coherence can also occur .",
    "thus , building a dqs is a more realistic goal in comparison to building a universal quantum computer .",
    "our concept of the dedicated quantum simulator is not a quantum computer but rather a quantum `` analog '' device , dedicated to a particular quantum computation .",
    "long time ago , before digital classical computers became fast enough to carry out numerical integration or differentiation , the so - called analog computers were used for that purpose . to obtain the integral or the derivative of a function @xmath1 ,",
    "an electrical time - dependent current , which changes in time in the same fashion as the function @xmath1 , was used as input to a circuit which contains a capacitor or an impedance . for the integral or the derivative of the input function one would measure the voltage across the capacitor or across the impedance respectively .",
    "no digital computation was carried out by such a device , but the entire `` computation '' was based on the physical property of the device used . a particular physical circuit was dedicated to a specific computation , i.e. , the capacitor circuit for integration , while the impedance circuit for differentiation . in this paper",
    "we introduce a dedicated quantum simulator whose relationship to a quantum computer is analogous to the relationship of a digital classical computer to an analog classical computer .",
    "notice that we are careful and we use the term `` simulator '' as opposed to the term `` computer '' .",
    "it is well known in statistical mechanics that the landau - ginzburg model of a superfluid can be mapped onto the @xmath2 model .",
    "the @xmath2 model can also describe the critical fluctuations of certain types of magnetic systems where the order parameter is a two component vector .",
    "thus , instead of using a digital computer to compute the critical exponents associated with the superfluid to normal - fluid phase transition , one can study the experimental results obtained on such a designed magnetic system assuming that the connection ( the mapping ) of the magnetic system to the @xmath2 model is accurate .",
    "one could therefore think of this model magnetic system as a _ dedicated simulator _ of the critical properties of the superfluid .",
    "the idea can be extended further to a pure quantum many body system where we are interested in the statistical properties of that system .",
    "if we could prepare a physical system which is described by a known model quantum hamiltonian , all we would have to do is perform measurements of the desired observables .",
    "it is rather hopeless to expect that we could configure atoms together to interact in our desired way as in the model hamiltonian .",
    "quantum dots share many features with the atomic spectra and they are sometimes called `` artificial '' atoms .",
    "the parameters defining a quantum dot can be artificially controlled and designed .",
    "in addition , one can create arrays of such dots where we can manipulate their interactions .",
    "therefore , if we could design an array of quantum dots interacting in a similar way , the original physical system can exist at a very different energy scale but as long as the model system ( used in the simulation ) shares the same geometry and the same values of doping and dimensionless parameter ratios one can directly compare dimensionless ratios of observables using scaling .",
    "this is what we call `` dedicated quantum simulator '' and has nothing to do with the functions involved in quantum computing , just in the same way as the question of how a classical digital computer works is irrelevant to the problem of an analog computation .",
    "making a quantum computer that performs operations which are controllable at the so - called q - bit level is a far more difficult task than making a device that can perform such a dedicated task to solve a specific quantum many fermion hamiltonian .",
    "the reason is that every nature s operation is quantum mechanical and thus we can `` take advantage '' of that and instead of breaking down the problem into a huge set of classical operations we prepare a many - body quantum system which is described by , and thus can mimic exactly , the theoretical many - body hamiltonian which we wish to solve .    in this paper , we choose to give an example of a two - dimensional quantum - dot array which can be mapped to a hubbard - like hamiltonian identical to that used to describe the physics of the @xmath3 plane of the high temperature superconductors .",
    "this serves as model for the copper - oxide plane in the copper - oxide superconductors based on a quantum dot two - dimensional array .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the quantum - dot array does not contain phonons as degrees of freedom and thus , one can determine the physical properties in the absence of phonons .",
    "the quantum - dot system exists at an energy scale ( a few @xmath4 ) which is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of real physical system .",
    "we think of this system of the array of quantum dots as a quantum simulator of the physics of the original system .",
    "we also discuss that this system should form stripes at the appropriate filling factor in an analogous manner to that in the copper - oxide superconductors .",
    "in addition , we discuss how to use this model to study the formation of stripes in the original problem of the copper - oxide planes .",
    "we wish to consider a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) which forms in an @xmath5 heterostructure .",
    "such a heterostructure can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on a @xmath6 doped @xmath7 substrate . on top of this layer one",
    "grows a layer of pure @xmath8 .",
    "next , a layer of pure @xmath7 is grown which has smaller gap than @xmath8 .",
    "the 2deg is formed in this last layer near the interface with the @xmath8 layer . a positive voltage applied to the @xmath6 doped substrate controls the density of the 2deg .",
    "two - dimensional electron densities of the order of @xmath9 are desirable for the application described in this paper .",
    "a spacer of pure @xmath7 between the substrate and the @xmath8 material may also be necessary to increase the mobility of the electrons at the interface .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of the @xmath0 plane of the copper - oxide superconductors .",
    "for this example , we propose the metallic gate with the hole pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ hetero2 ] , i.e. , with an array of two different size holes placed onto the heterostructure as the top electrode .",
    "such patterns can be `` drilled '' on a thin metallic plate with e - beam lithography .",
    "a negative gate voltage @xmath10 is applied between this gate and the 2deg .",
    "first , let us consider a single hole of radius @xmath11 created on the metallic gate . at a distance @xmath12 from the gate ,",
    "the potential is modified from its value in the absence of the hole by an amount @xmath13 given by@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electric field below the top metallic gate in the absence of the hole and @xmath16 is the dielectric constant for pure @xmath7 .",
    "here we have considered a cylindrical coordinate system with the @xmath17 axis perpendicular to the plane and passing through the center of the hole with @xmath18 the distance from the axis .",
    "the electrons are thus trapped a in quantum well and as they move away from @xmath19 they feel a parabolic repulsion which for small @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electron effective mass .",
    "we consider a metallic gate with the array of holes shown in fig .",
    "[ hetero2 ] which produce a modification of the external field at the interface which is the superposition of the change caused by each hole : @xmath23 where @xmath24 spans the entire square lattice of lattice spacing @xmath25 formed by the centers of the larger holes of radius @xmath26 .",
    "the smaller holes of radius @xmath27 are at positions @xmath28 where @xmath29 takes the values @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this potential can be considered as an external field felt by the 2deg and to which the electrons will respond . if the negative gate potential is not strong enough to cause total depletion of the heterojunction from the 2deg , the electronic charge of the heterojunction will move to benefit from the less repulsive potential near the holes .",
    "the self - consistent potential landscape on the heterojunction will depend on the 2d electron density and is expected to look schematically as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ 3dpot ] for a cluster of one hole surrounded by 4 smaller ones .",
    "we will assume that the electrons in the dots feel a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "clear experimental indication@xcite that electrostatically confined quantum dots feel parabolic confinement comes from the magic numbers observed .",
    "let us denote by @xmath32 the eigenstates of the 2d harmonic oscillator in cartesian coordinates . in the case where we have square lattice symmetry",
    "the circular symmetry of the `` atomic '' potential is reduced and we need to consider irreducible representations of the group @xmath33 . in our illustrative example of the array the dots have at most 12 electrons per dot . in these cases",
    "we will need only the following orbitals :    \\i ) the state with lowest energy is the state with @xmath34-wave symmetry given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",

    "[ hetero2 ] with quantum dots of two different radii @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath52 . in the smaller",
    "dot the potential starts from a higher value at its center .",
    "the spacing between the energy spectra depends on the frequencies @xmath53 and @xmath54 . by controlling the relative depth of the potential in the dots ( by changing @xmath10 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and the density of the 2deg ( using the back - gate voltage )",
    ", we can create the following situation .",
    "the larger dot is filled with 12 electrons in the @xmath55 pseudo - atomic configuration and the smaller dot with 6 electrons in the @xmath56 pseudo - atomic configuration .",
    "thus the highest occupied levels are the @xmath12 for the large dots and the @xmath37 for the small dots .",
    "next , we show how this can be achieved .",
    "we need to estimate the required quantum - dot sizes and 2d electron densities necessary for producing the case discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "we need to satisfy the following condition : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the chemical potential for each of the quantum dots in the presence of only the quadratic term of the interaction in eq .",
    "[ harmonic ] . here",
    "@xmath59 is the total dot energy as a function of the electron number and we need to distinguish @xmath60 from @xmath61 because of the two different dot sizes .",
    "there are several calculations for a single quantum dot using various approximations@xcite .",
    "these calculations have been carried out using a fixed value of the external parameter @xmath62 of the harmonic confining potential .",
    "our problem here is more complex because for a given value of @xmath26 we need to determine @xmath27 required to satisfy eq .",
    "[ equal - mu ] and this requires the knowledge of the full function @xmath59 .",
    "next , we present a simple model to express the energy of one dot in a harmonic potential of external frequency @xmath63 . we represent the @xmath64-dot wave - function as a slater - determinant of hermite polynomials which correspond to a 2d harmonic oscillator potential of `` dressed '' frequency @xmath65 .",
    "the value of @xmath65 will be determined by minimizing the expectation value of the hamiltonian which includes the coulomb interaction .",

    "the last term corresponds to the electron - electron interaction which scales as @xmath71 with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , it is inversely proportional to the dot size which implies that it is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 gives a measure of the coulomb interaction in the dot when all the important dependences are scaled out and we expect it to be almost independent of @xmath65 and @xmath64 . in the capacitance model for large dots , @xmath73 is a constant . assuming a universal value for @xmath73 for any dot in a parabolic potential , for a given value of @xmath62 and @xmath64 the energy",

    "the agreement is very satisfactory given the fact that the same value of @xmath73 is used for the results obtained for three very different values of @xmath76 .",
    "we take @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath7 and we choose @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 and we find that , @xmath84 and in order to satisfy eq .",

    "we can tune the doping ( controlled by the back - gate potential ) to fill the two dots with @xmath92 and @xmath93 electrons .",
    "this can be achieved by controlling the total 2d electron density to be @xmath94 and taking @xmath95 ( @xmath25 should be larger than @xmath96 for our example here ) , this corresponds to a 2d density of @xmath97 .",
    "if we reduce the value of the electron density further we can change the filling of the @xmath37-level of the small dots and of the @xmath12-level of the larger hole . by changing @xmath10 , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath12",
    "we can increase the @xmath62 s which will increase the required 2d electron density .    in order to describe the electron hopping from a @xmath37-level of the small dot to the @xmath98 level of the neighboring larger dot",

    "short as well as long range coulomb interaction should be included in the above hamiltonian in order to understand the phase diagram of such an array of quantum dots .",
    "however , even when one attempts to describe the physics of the @xmath3 planes in the copper - oxide superconductors one should include these interactions .",
    "the copper - oxide materials exhibit@xcite stripe formation at filling factor of @xmath126 . numerical studies@xcite of the t - j model , which is a possible reduction of the above three - orbital model@xcite , indicate that the model has a phase separation instability .",
    "some different numerical studies@xcite of this model indicate that the system at least with cylindrical boundary conditions seems to form stripes at the appropriate filling factor and value of @xmath127 . independently of the controversy surrounding the stripe formation in the t - j model@xcite",
    ", it may be expected that stripes form when the long range part of the coulomb interaction is included in the t - j model . at the appropriate filling factor",
    "one might expect formation of stripes in the quantum dot system described previously .",
    "the quantum dot array discussed here can not allow a macroscopic electronic charge separation , thus , we expect ( just like in the real copper - oxide superconductors ) to see a striped state or another form of clustering of charge and spin .",
    "the formation of the stripe state can be investigated using the quantum dot array proposed in the present paper .",
    "we expect that the stripe state can be detected by electric force microscopy ( efm ) .",
    "since the inter - dot distance is of the order of @xmath128 , atomic scale spatial resolution is not required .",
    "however , we need to be able to detect electric potential variation on the surface of the quantum dot array of the order of @xmath129 or smaller .",
    "therefore a special purpose tip coated with a metal layer should be made which should be wider than the typical size in order to detect the voltage change associated with such inhomogeneous charge distribution when stripe formation occurs .",
    "transport measurements can be also performed which can possibly shed light on the original problem .",
    "conductance measurements have already been performed on one - dimensional arrays of quantum dots@xcite .",
    "there are indications@xcite that an anderson - mott metal - insulator transition might have been observed@xcite . at filling factors around one hole per unit cell",
    ", one expects to find an antiferromagnetically ordered insulator . by applying a magnetic field the structure can be converted to a metal .",
    "in addition , capacitance measurements can be used to measure the `` addition '' energy of adding an extra electron to the quantum dot array .",
    "we would like to discuss decoherence or the effect of noise on the proposed device . in a universal quantum computer",
    "not only the devices representing q - bits are required to be free from noise and decoherence but , in addition , one needs to be able to manipulate them without destruction of coherence .",
    "the latter issue obviously does not arise in our case of the dedicated quantum simulator .",
    "the proposed device , however , and the original system are both affected by decoherence effects .",
    "the cuo planes are hardly in a vacuum , phonons being not far in energy from the energy separation between the electronic states .",
    "what is being proposed is a device for simulating a particular model hamiltonian , which may have many features in common with 2d lattice models .",
    "so the question is to what extent one can neglect noise and get reliable answers concerning mostly thermodynamic information that is discussed in this paper .",
    "one expects that there will be regions of the thermodynamic phase diagram of the proposed device which will be strongly affected by impurities , imperfections and other sources of noise and regions which will not be strongly affected .",
    "the full calculation of the effects of such noise on the phase diagram of these models is left as an open problem ; to answer it one needs to carry out a more complete calculation of the electronic properties of the proposed device and their sensitivity to the various sources of noise .    in summary , we have shown that the 2d quantum - dot array produced by the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ hetero2 ] using the calculated hole sizes and proposed gate voltages and doping values , maps onto the strong coupling limit of the hamiltonian given by eqs .",
    "( [ tbind],[hubbard ] ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is that used to describe the physics of the @xmath3 plane of the copper - oxide superconductors .",
    "this quantum dot array can be considered as an `` analog '' quantum computer ( as opposed to digital ) or a dedicated quantum simulator of the dynamics of the @xmath3 planes in these materials . in particular",
    "we have shown that the striped state formed in the above materials , which seems to be hard to study experimentally@xcite , can be studied and analyzed using an analog system of such a 2d quantum dot array which is predicted to form a stripe state with a wavelength of mesoscopic size .",
    "this allows conventional imaging methods such as efm to be used .",
