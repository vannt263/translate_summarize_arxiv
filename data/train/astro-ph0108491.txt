    "the size and cooling of the submillimetron telescope optics is the same as it was in previous infrared mission iras and iso .",
    "two main features differ it from these missions and new ones ( sirtf , first , planck , astro - f ) :    * free flying spacecraft using facilities of the russian segment of iss for deployment and maintenance * novel type microbolometers ( nheb ) with cooling down to 0.1 k and reaching sensitivity limited by low extraterrestrial background    first feature permits to realize the instrument of relatively low mass and cost , second one - to surpass new missions submillimeter instruments in sensitivity for surveys of large sky regions ( full sky ) .",
    "first and most bulky goals of submillimetron observations are :    * full sky catalog of submillimeter sources , confusion limited at @xmath1 resolution ; * cosmological background study , reducing errors of anisotropy measurements by means of more detailed information on foreground sources .    in the field of observational techniques the goal is testing of novel type high - sensitive bolometer , which has not been used for astronomical observation and was especially designed for conditions of low extraterrestrial background .",
    "the experiment can be also testbed for future large cryogenic telescopes , including asc / lpi millimetron project for lagrange point l2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "other tasks :    * study in submillimeter and infrared wavelengths of the `` cold '' component of the matter in the universe ( dust in the solar system , galaxy , and in extragalactic sources ) * study of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation and search for lyman - alpha line in the epoch of recombination and secondary heating * studies of the spectra of astronomical sources and their variability",
    ".    targets of observations :    * cmb - cosmological background radiation , spectrum , mapping ; * clusters of galaxies , dust , sz - effect ; * `` mirror '' galaxies , relativistic particles , dust ; * ir galaxies , dust , cosmological evolution ; * agn - active galactic nuclei , spectrum , variability ; * interstellar dust in our galaxy , spectrum , mapping ; * cocoons , young stars , star envelopes , protoplanets ; * cold stars , peculiar and variable stars ; * neutron stars and galactic black holes , remnants of supernovae ; * center of galaxy * ; * interplanetary dust , belts ; * planets , asteroids and comets ; * dyson spheres ( ceti ) .",

    "a call for proposal on additional scientific instruments for heterodyne spectrometry and interferometry is now in stage of preparation .",
    "the launch is approved for the 2-d stage of iss realization , when finished its assembling . after docking to iss , deployment of the telescope and screens there",
    "will begin a period of free - flying observation with duration of 1 - 2 year . in this period docking for repair and replacement of instruments parts are permitted . after the end of this observation period and docking to russian segment of iss ( figure  [ gromovv_fig : fig2 ] ) an upgrade of instrument is planned with attachment of larger telescope mirror with diameter 3.5 m or more .",
    "cryogenic telescope of the submillimetron project consists of cassegrain optical system entirely cooled with several stages of refrigeration : radiation cooling , active cooling machine , and passive cooling with storage of liquid helium .",

    "other type of bolometer with sensitivity comparable with nheb is tes ( transition edge superconductive ) bolometer , which technology uses experience of tes detectors for x - ray astronomy .",
    "its drawback is a narrow temperature region of superconductive transition , which exclude functioning of the device overheated by enhanced background emission possible in sufficient part of submillimeter - wave survey . on the contrary",

    "the merits of the iss - related experiment are : it s low cost , reliability and flexibility due to use of iss means for deployment , maintenance and instruments change .",
    "new ir / submm projects following on iras , cobe and iso use large mirrors ( more than meter ) , which can not be cooled to temperatures lower than tens of k. a development of the submillimetron project has shown that progress in observational technique is possible not only by refuse of proven technology of space optics and cryogenics , but also by progress in detector technology .",
    "full sky data of high sensitive submillimeter observations with resolution about 1  are important complementary to first and plank missions .",
