    "network rigidity deals with a system of particles subjected to a set of constraints . depending on the number and position of these constraints ,",
    "the system will have a residual number of independent degrees of freedom . a simple way of characterizing the degree of mechanical stability of a given framework is to ignore the way constraints are positioned , and to treat all constraints as independent . in this approximation ,",
    "the number of independent degrees of freedom governing internal motions , @xmath0 , in the framework is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dimension of the system , @xmath3 is the number of vertices , @xmath4 the number of constraints , and the trivial rigid body motions of the entire framework subtracted out . the use of constraint counting to determine structural stability in macroscopic systems dates back to maxwell @xcite .",
    "nearly 25 years ago , philips @xcite realized that constraint counting is applicable to microstructure in covalent glasses by treating central and bond - bending forces in covalent bonds as nearest and next nearest neighbor distance constraints .",
    "this simple global counting of constraints is commonly referred to as maxwell counting , which may result in positive or negative values for @xmath0 .",
    "a negative @xmath0 indicates the network is over - constrained .",
    "philips @xcite qualitatively explained why covalent glass networks with low average coordination form more easily . shortly afterward , the notion of rigidity percolation was introduced by thorpe @xcite , where depending on chemical composition a network would microscopically be in a floppy or rigid state , having a well defined rigidity percolation threshold .",
    "experiments @xcite have shown many physical properties in covalent glasses are related to the rigidity transition . in spite of the unique insight that the theory of network rigidity offers",
    ", it is unfortunate that it still remains a relatively obscure subject .",
    "an authoritative source on concepts of rigidity and its broad range of interdisciplinary applications can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "network rigidity exhibits long - range character @xcite that makes calculating properties difficult using brute force methods on elastic networks @xcite .",
    "however , the mathematics of first order graph rigidity @xcite referred to in the physics literature as _ generic rigidity _",
    "greatly simplifies calculations @xcite .",
    "atomic coordinates are not required in generic rigidity .",
    "only the connectivity property of the network is important , making it possible to calculate many static mechanical properties exactly using an integer based combinatoric algorithm .",
    "in particular , the exact number of internal independent degrees of freedom can be calculated , all rigid substructures can be identified as well as all correlated motions that couple the network of rigid clusters .",
    "one such algorithm , referred to as the _ pebble game _ , is available for general networks in two dimensions @xcite and for bond - bending networks in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "a bond - bending network has the property that all angles between the central - force constraints that stem outward from an atom are fixed .",
    "in addition , dihedral angles can be constrained .",
    "covalent glasses are ideal systems to model as a quenched bond - bending network , where there is a natural separation between hard - strong forces ( central and bond - bending forces ) and soft - weak forces ( torsional and non - bonding forces ) .",
    "the large gap in force strength justifies the treatment of covalent glass networks at room temperature to be modeled as a mechanical network  essentially a @xmath5 calculation .",
    "recently , constraint counting has been applied to protein structure @xcite where covalent bonds , salt - bridges , hydrogen bonds and torsional forces on resonant bonds ( the peptide bond , for example ) were modeled as mechanical distance constraints . by treating the folded protein structure as a quenched mechanical bond - bending network ,",
    "flexible and rigid regions were identified and found to correlate well with biologically relevant motions .",
    "network rigidity in proteins has also been found to correlate with protein folding pathways @xcite .",
    "the success of the @xmath5 calculations on protein structure suggest that the folded state of the protein acts very much like a mechanical machine under the conditions responsible for the native fold to be thermodynamically stable .",
    "this result is reassuring , as it has been well appreciated that protein function is very precise in its response to molecules it encounters having a high degree of specificity that makes it appear to respond like a mechanical machine .",
    "this empirical observation motivated the use of network rigidity calculations at @xmath5 in the first place . in spite of the success that many mechanical aspects of a protein fold can be quantitatively characterized ,",
    "it is also well known @xcite that protein stability is a result of a delicate balance between many weak non - covalent interactions . in particular , enthalpic and entropic contributions",
    "must be part of the ledger of accounts to understand protein stability .",
    "the study of protein stability has motivated this work in generalizing the concept of network rigidity to be applicable at finite temperatures in physical systems having interactions that do not divide into strong and weak compared to @xmath6 .",
    "when viewing a protein as a mechanical network , two serious problems immediately become apparent .",
    "firstly , hydrogen bonds are continually breaking and forming consistent with thermal fluctuations , and secondly , hydrogen bonds have a wide variety of strength that is dependent on their local environment @xcite . in prior work",
    "an energetic cut - off criterion @xcite was introduced to determine a set of hydrogen bonds to model as a constraint .",
    "as the energy cut - off was varied , a hierarchical analysis of rigid clusters was used to characterize the protein structure .",
    "unfortunately , the energy cut - off was not directly related to thermodynamic stability , nor the entropy from molecular flexibility was considered , which limited the range of validity of the ( t=0 ) rigidity model to be near the native structure .",
    "these problems can be resolved by modeling microscopic interactions as distance constraints , where each distance constraint represents a free energy component within the system . assigning free energy contributions to specific types of interactions",
    "is commonly done to interpret experimental measurements and in theoretical discussions on protein stability @xcite .",
    "however , the utility of such a decomposition is questionable because in general it is not possible to obtain the total free energy by simply summing the free energy components @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the free energy of a system can be obtained from its free energy components by employing network rigidity calculations at finite temperature , which combines mechanical and thermodynamic points of views .    in section [ sec : dcm ] a distance constraint model ( dcm ) is introduced that enables the partition function to be calculated in terms of an ensemble of mechanical frameworks . after the concept of a constraint is generalized to contain thermodynamic information , each mechanical framework of constraints provides an underlying interaction that couples enthalpic and entropic terms appearing in boltzmann factors . in section",
    "[ sec : toy ] two simple 2-dimensional toy models are worked out to illustrate the details involved in a calculation . as a final example",
    ", an exact solution of a distance constraint model for homogeneous peptides that undergo an alpha - helix to coil transition is considered in section [ sec : helix - coil ] . in section [ sec :",
    "discussion ] , the results from all three models are discussed , and the standard lifson - roig model for a helix - coil transition is compared with the dcm .",
    "conclusions are made in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "lord kelvin said , `` i never satisfy myself until i can make a mechanical model of a thing .",
    "if i can make a mechanical model i can understand it ! ''",
    "the distance constraint model ( dcm ) that will be introduced and carefully discussed in the following subsections closely adheres to kelvin s belief .",
    "the objective is to use a mechanical model to understand thermal stability in biopolymers ( the focus of this paper ) as well as other systems such as formation of chalcogenide glasses .",
    "the dcm begins by representing a macromolecule and interactions therein as a mechanical bar - joint framework . for a single static structure , generic network rigidity properties can be calculated exactly using a graph - algorithm that does not depend on geometrical coordinates of atoms , but only on the _ topological _ arrangement of distance constraints .",
    "network rigidity is used here as an umbrella - phrase to refer to the following mechanical properties of a bar - joint framework :    1 .",
    "identification of all rigid clusters , where each distinct cluster of atoms forms a rigid body .",
    "identification of all over - constrained regions , within which elastic strain energy resides . 3 .",
    "identification of all flexible regions , wherein the atomic structure can continuously deform .",
    "identification of all independent constraints and degrees of freedom .",
    "these basic mechanical properties are quite useful in characterizing a single static structure . in this paper",
    ", we will generalize the mechanical description ( at t=0 ) by employing an ensemble - based approach to account for thermodynamics .",
    "thermodynamics determines the fate of a biopolymer , albeit kinetic detours and traps .",
    "for example , a protein unfolds when an increase in conformational entropy outweighs a gain in enthalpy from an associated loss of many favorable intra - molecular noncovalent interactions .",
    "furthermore , a functional protein in the native state is stable against thermal fluctuations through enthalpy - entropy compensation .",
    "the distance constraint model ( dcm ) uses network rigidity as an underlying interaction . through non - local mechanical interactions ,",
    "network rigidity answers the question about which degrees of freedom are independent and directly relates to the non - additively of measured component free energies .",
    "although the total enthalpy is additive , the entropy is not .",
    "this non - additive property of component entropies derives from not knowing which degrees of freedom in the system are independent or redundant .",
    "however , generic network rigidity properties can be calculated exactly with the pebble game by recursively adding one constraint at a time to build a framework .",
    "as constraints are added , some atoms will become part of a rigid cluster .",
    "a new constraint is redundant when added to an already rigid region and independent when it removes a degree of freedom .",
    "all distance constraints are treated the same in the pebble game , and there is a clear distinction between a constraint and degree of freedom .    in the dcm , interactions are represented as distance constraints , each characterized by an enthalpy and an entropy contribution assumed to depend only on local structural properties .",
    "constraints are quantified as being strong or weak based on their entropy contribution .",
    "a ( greater , lesser ) entropy contribution implies a ( weaker , stronger ) constraint .",
    "the key aspect of the dcm is that stronger constraints must be placed in the network before weaker ones in order to generalize network rigidity to finite temperatures .",
    "this leads to a preferential ordering , which is implemented operationally as :    1 .",
    "sort all constraints based on entropy assignments in increasing order , thereby ranking them from strongest to weakest .",
    "2 .   add constraints recursively one at a time using the pebble game according to the rank ordering from strongest to weakest , until the entire structure is completely rigid .",
    "the dcm is mathematically well defined and physically intuitive .",
    "the essential idea is that weak constraints allow more conformational freedom than do strong constraints .",
    "stronger constraints take precedence in defining rigid structures because weaker constraints are more accommodating .",
    "thus , a weak constraint acts like a degree of freedom relative to a strong constraint .",
    "consequently , _ the notion of a constraint and degree of freedom can not be distinguished clearly once entropy price tags are introduced_. rather , a quantitative measure for conformational entropy is obtained for the structure , whereas the @xmath5 style of constraint counting simply regards the structure as completely rigid . in this way",
    "the dcm provides a natural mechanism for enthalpy - entropy compensation .",
    "for example , if by some fluctuation a strong constraint breaks ( such as a hydrogen bond ) there will be a destabilizing gain in enthalpy , but also a compensating gain in conformational entropy as a weaker constraint substitutes . the technical aspects and mathematical details of the dcm",
    "are now addressed .",
    "the distance constraint model ( dcm ) views a physical system at a coarse - grain level as defining a mechanical bar - joint framework .",
    "a framework is constructed from distance constraints that are used to represent microscopic interactions .",
    "each distance constraint defines an equation of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the distance between a pair of atoms .",
    "a microscopic interaction involving a group of atoms ( more than two ) can be modeled by more than one distance constraint , where the collection of distance constraints between different pairs of atoms are simply referred to as a _ constraint _ ( without the word _ distance _ as a qualifier ) .",
    "a hydrogen bond is an example of a many body interaction that will be modeled as a particular type of constraint consisting of three ( pairwise ) distance constraints .",
    "the enthalpy and entropy contributions from a specific type of interaction characterize the corresponding constraint type",
    ". therefore , let ( @xmath9 ) be the change in ( enthalpy , entropy ) that quantifies constraint type , @xmath10 , when it is added to a framework . over the ensemble of all accessible atomic configurations , the many different geometries between atoms will potentially result in a vast number of constraint types that must be introduced .",
    "however , as demonstrated below , a remarkably few number of constraint types will often be sufficient to quantitatively capture the essential physics .",
    "the microstates of a system are specified in terms of mechanical frameworks , @xmath11 , where each framework uniquely defines the _ topology of all distance constraints_. the dcm is built upon the idea that each framework , @xmath11 , having a specific topology represents a mini - ensemble of bar - joint networks of strict distance constraints within the tolerance allowed by the geometrical coarse graining .",
    "one framework consists of many possible atomic - coordinate realizations of strict distance constraints .",
    "however , because generic rigidity properties are sought that do not depend on the geometrical details of atomic coordinates , each realization in this mini - ensemble has exactly the same network rigidity properties .",
    "thus , the framework label , @xmath11 , represents an ensemble of bar - joint frameworks sharing identical network rigidity properties that are calculated using strict distance constraints .",
    "the relation to thermodynamics can be made because a framework uniquely identifies a mini - ensemble having constant constraint topology , enabling a free energy , given as @xmath12 , to be meaningfully assigned . to this end",
    ", the total enthalpy of a framework is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of _ constraints _ of type @xmath10 that are present . by exploring all accessible _ atomic configurations _",
    ", an ensemble of frameworks ( each representing a distinct topology ) is generated .",
    "the ensemble of frameworks partitions phase space into discrete parts , each having a constant enthalpy over a limited range of conformational freedom .",
    "therefore , the partition function is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the conformational degeneracy of framework @xmath11 .",
    "the novel aspect of the dcm is that the conformational entropy , given by @xmath17 , is obtained by adding component entropies over independent distance constraints that are explicitly identified using generic rigidity . simply adding component entropies over _ all",
    "_ distance constraints will generally lead to a drastic overestimate for @xmath18",
    ". however , identification of whether a distance constraint is independent or redundant is not unique .",
    "the freedom in choosing which distance constraints are independent is akin to the freedom in choosing an independent basis set of vectors to span a vector space .",
    "consequently , the addition of component entropies over independent distance constraints will lead to multiple answers for @xmath19 if based on arbitrary selections .",
    "therefore , an auxiliary _ preferential selection criterion _ for how to choose the optimal set of independent distance constraints is required .",
    "the crucial part of the dcm is that it enforces a preferential selection criterion that corresponds to the determination of the _ minimum _ possible value of @xmath19 .",
    "the total conformational entropy for framework , @xmath11 , is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of independent _ distance constraints _ of type @xmath10 present in the framework as determined by the preferential , @xmath22 , selection criterion .",
    "the method for determining linearly independent constraint equations involves building a basis set by iteration , where a new constraint equation is checked for independence against the current basis set .",
    "if the new constraint equation is independent , then the basis set expands .",
    "the procedure is continued until all distance constraints in the framework are checked .",
    "the preferential selection criterion is defined as : _ distance constraints with lower component entropies take precedence in the order that they are checked for linear independence_. by applying the preferential selection criterion in conjunction with exact constraint counting for generic rigidity , the change in gibbs free energy for framework , @xmath11 , is given as @xmath23 only in the case that _ all _ distance constraints in the framework are independent will @xmath24 be equal to a straightforward sum over the component free energies , @xmath25 , associated with each constraint type .",
    "the partition function is calculated as @xmath26 in accordance to the standard form , except each microstate corresponds to a generic mechanical framework , @xmath11 , made up of ( infinitely strong ) holonomic distance constraints , and the ensemble consist of all topologically distinct frameworks .",
    "meaningful thermodynamic properties are directly tied to local atomic structure because of coarse graining over geometrical bins . to reflect the geometrical aspect of the dcm , the index @xmath10 is represented by two indices @xmath27 , where @xmath28 now specifies the type of constraint and @xmath29 labels a specific geometrical bin . for example",
    ", a hydrogen bond is a particular type of interaction , but its strength depends on its local geometry .",
    "the component free energy of the @xmath28-th type of microscopic interaction is expressed as a free energy function , @xmath30 , which accounts for all atomic positions of the group of atoms under consideration within the @xmath29-th geometrical bin .",
    "the process of obtaining a free energy decomposition @xcite ( the set of @xmath30 used in the model ) is not unique because different types of interactions will involve one or more overlapping atoms .",
    "also there will be unavoidable many body effects , such as electrostatic interactions between the atoms of interest with all other atoms , including those in solvent .",
    "the non - uniqueness of a free energy decomposition can be used as an advantage in the process of defining constituent types of constraints .    an effective strategy in employing",
    "the dcm is to define a minimum number of constraint types with limited number of geometries that will yield a desired level of accuracy in predictions . for each @xmath27 ,",
    "the enthalpy and entropy contributions denoted as ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) can in principle be determined self - consistently in lieu of not being unique .",
    "self consistency is satisfied when the free energy assignment to small clusters of atoms used in defining constraint types _ locally _ obey the preferential selection criterion .",
    "this means that various clusters of atoms ( for example , those within an amino acid or hydrogen bond ) define subsystems that are treated the same way as the full system . knowing the thermodynamic properties of a cluster of atoms allows constraint types to be defined and characterized with a @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in principle , a _ hierarchical _ set of constraint types can be constructed iteratively by defining constraints with lowest component entropies first , and in succession defining constraints with the next lowest component entropy , etc .",
    "the procedure to determine the local thermodynamic functions ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) for all constraint types and their geometries constitutes a preliminary step in the dcm . in principle explicit calculations for @xmath30 could be made using accurate physical theories ( i.e. quantum mechanical calculations ) involving clusters of atoms within a coherent potential approximation scheme .",
    "this type of bottom up approach should be tractable and the results would be very useful",
    ". however , these difficult calculations can be sidestepped ( completely or in part ) by writing down the parametric form of a microscopic free energy function with empirically derived parameters .",
    "the important outcomes are : 1 ) interactions are modeled as constraints characterized by two quantities ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) that can be determined by theoretical means or fitting to large sets of experimental data , and 2 ) the dcm parameters can be expected to be transferable between systems that are well described by the same set of constraint types .",
    "the dcm invokes a probabilistic interpretation that all distance constraint realizations between atoms are uniformly distributed within a geometrical bin . by allowing each atom a finite amount of freedom",
    ", it is ensured that the framework can be treated as generic .",
    "although there will be configurations that have atypical atomic positions , these will be of zero measure .",
    "therefore , the system is modeled as a collection of generically placed holonomic constraints , for which many mechanical properties can be calculated using exact constraint counting algorithms .",
    "the connection to thermodynamics enters into the rigidity calculation by determining the correct boltzmann weight assignment to each mechanical framework , which is related to the non - additivity of component entropies .",
    "the selected set of independent constraints under the preferential selection criterion does not depend on coordinates in so far that the same framework is maintained over a _ limited range of conformational freedom_. this limited range of conformational freedom is quantified by the total entropy , @xmath19 , which depends strongly on the topology of distance constraints present in the system .",
    "calculating the exact value for @xmath19 will unfortunately not be possible in the dcm .",
    "the preferential selection criterion is enforced to obtain the best estimate for each framework .",
    "fundamentally , overlap in phase space can occur when two constraints are independent but not orthogonal .",
    "the direct result of adding component entropies associated with only independent constraints is that less phase space will be `` double counted '' .",
    "therefore , adding component entropies over independent constraints gives an _ upper bound _ for @xmath19 .",
    "the preferential selection criterion ensures the lowest possible upper bound because the _ strongest _ distance constraints defined by the smallest entropies are taken as independent before _",
    "weaker _ distance constraints having larger entropies .",
    "the utility of the dcm will depend on the degree of accuracy in estimating conformational degeneracy .",
    "note that distance constraints not sharing atoms are orthogonal , and do not contribute in over - counting phase space .",
    "although the distance constraints that share atoms will not generally be orthogonal , by construction of a self - consistent hierarchical series of constraints , phase space overlap between themselves locally is correctly taken into account . therefore an accurate @xmath33 can be expected by using a _",
    "complete set _ of self consistent constraint types .",
    "the phrase `` complete set '' is used to mean that for any position of atomic coordinates , _ a framework is always defined such that after all constraints are placed it is rigid_. as more constraint types are defined , a framework becomes increasingly more over constrained , which can only lead to a better lowest upper bound .",
    "the preferential selection criterion has a simple physical interpretation .",
    "each constraint that is added to a system can potentially reduce entropy .",
    "however , a redundant distance constraint does not reduce entropy @xcite .",
    "this is because when a constraint is added to a rigid region that is formed by stronger constraints , the weaker constraint will accommodate the structural geometry dictated by the cohort of stronger constraints @xcite .",
    "the strength of a constraint ( strong or weak ) is tied to phase space volume .",
    "therefore , a clear distinction between a constraint and degree of freedom is not possible .",
    "the rigidity calculation at finite temperature treats constraints and degrees of freedom on equal footing in the sense that weaker constraints act as degrees of freedom relative to stronger constraints . the entropy loss associated with an over constrained region",
    "is paid at a premium by the strongest member constraints .",
    "fortunately , the _ pebble game _",
    "algorithm @xcite for determining distance constraint independence is based on a recursive procedure of building a framework one constraint at a time .",
    "the new implementation only requires using a presorted list of distance constraints from strongest to weakest .",
    "it is worth noting that this algorithm does not model a kinetic process as the constraints in a particular framework are present all the time .",
    "rather , the entropy loss from a constraint has to do with its _ effectiveness _ relative to all other constraints in the framework .",
    "the term _ quenched constraint _ refers to a constraint type that will be present among a particular group of atoms in all frameworks of the ensemble .",
    "for example , over the temperature range of biological importance , covalent bonding between atoms within a protein is modeled as a set of quenched constraints .",
    "furthermore , the central and bond - bending forces that make up covalent bonding are modeled by constraints having microscopic free energies associated with a single geometrical bin .",
    "the torsional force component will also be modeled by a quenched constraint ( as the torsional force is always present ) but will have a microscopic free energy , @xmath30 , with multiple geometrical bins ( labeled by @xmath29 ) depending on the dihedral angle .",
    "a system modeled by a complete set of quenched constraints will generally be associated with an ensemble of frameworks because the enthalpic and entropic characteristics of distance constraints depend on local geometry . in the extreme case where only one framework is accessible",
    ", the dcm will not provide optimal accuracy whereas normal mode analysis is more appropriate .",
    "for example , if a fcc solid is modeled using one central force constraint type , then the dcm is equivalent to the einstein model .",
    "the term _ fluctuating constraint _ refers to a constraint type that may or may not be present among a particular group of atoms having a fixed geometry . when a fluctuating constraint is present , it is associated with a microscopic free energy , @xmath30 , in the same way as a quenched constraint .",
    "however , a fluctuating constraint is not strictly tied to geometry because it may not be present .",
    "the dcm allows for fluctuating constraints to account for degrees of freedom ( dof ) that are not explicitly part of a system .",
    "for example , solvent dof couple to protein atoms defining a system .",
    "the solvent - protein interactions are modeled as fluctuating constraints on the system . in this way ,",
    "hydration shells around protein atoms are modeled as fluctuating constraint types characterized by enthalpy , @xmath31 , and entropy , @xmath32 , contributions that account for the many body interactions .",
    "even more basic is the hydrogen bond .",
    "hydrogen bonding is modeled as a fluctuating constraint because 1 ) the protein atom electronic dof are not explicitly described , and 2 ) solvent dof compete with intra - molecular hydrogen bonding for a given geometry .",
    "thus , the dcm provides a real - space description involving mechanical constraints that directly accounts for fluctuating hydrogen bonding , such as found in proteins and water .",
    "the enthalpy and entropy contributions , ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) assigned to the various constraint types are functions of temperature , pressure , and other thermodynamic conditions dealing with the chemical environment , such as ph , ionic strength or whether the local geometry is in a hydrophobic or polar neighborhood .",
    "therefore , caution must be exercised in the ordering of the constraints from strongest to weakest , because this ordering may change as the thermodynamic conditions change .",
    "consequently , the environmentally induced re - ordering of constraint types by relative strength could potentially cause dramatic conformational change .",
    "however , the utility of the dcm can best be appreciated by using a simplified description .",
    "model parameters will be taken as constants .",
    "furthermore , the entropic term will be distributed equally over all the distance constraints that model a particular constraint type .",
    "then , all microscopic free energies will have the generic form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is energy , @xmath36 is a dimensionless variable referred to as pure entropy , and @xmath37 is the number of distance constraints that are used to model the @xmath28-th constraint type .",
    "pure entropies are taken to be positive because they are fundamentally related to the number of accessible quantum states that are associated with a specified geometrical bin tolerance , given by @xmath38 .",
    "figure [ fig : hierarchical2 ] shows two example constraint types that will be used in section [ sec : helix - coil ] to model an @xmath39-helix to coil transition .",
    "a constraint type is now generically characterized as @xmath40 .",
    "these parameters can be interpreted as being derived by taylor expanding to first order the true microscopic gibbs free energy about some temperature of most interest .",
    "analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dh ] ) , the total energy of a framework is given as @xmath41 where @xmath42 equals ( 1,0 ) when the @xmath43-th constraint of the @xmath28-th type is ( present , or not present ) within the @xmath29-th geometrical bin .",

    "( [ eq : pf3 ] ) suggests that the energy and entropy contributions are independent .",
    "however , not only do the values of \\",
    "{ @xmath50 } depend on calculations from generic rigidity , but when @xmath51 then @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the energy and entropy of each framework is coupled through topology via the underlying interaction of network rigidity .",
    "for example , consider the entropy loss associated with the formation of a hydrogen bond . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hierarchical2]b the hydrogen bond constraint is modeled as three distance constraints . for a particular geometry",

    "in contrast , if @xmath54 is comparatively large indicating a _ relatively _ weak distance constraint , then the greatest entropy loss for the system occurs when all three distance constraints are redundant .",

    "the difference is that the dcm attempts to include non - local cooperative interactions explicitly by using generic rigidity calculations to account for the non - additivity of entropy .",
    "yet it is possible to construct a dcm where there is very little entropic competition between constraint types , such as given in column ( a ) in table [ table : dim ] . in this case",
    ", the dcm for a helix - coil transition is _ identical _ to the _ general form _ of the lr model .",
    "it is worth noting that the two commonly used lr parameters @xcite , ( @xmath298 ) , are only a subset of sixteen parameters that must be defined for each possible type of propagation ( i.e. @xmath299 @xmath300 @xmath276 , and 15 more ) .",

    "not surprising , the gas phase transition temperature is elevated with respect to model - water solvent , because alternate hydrogen bonds from backbone to solvent can not replace intra hydrogen bonds as they break . the greater energy cost to unravel the rigid helical structure requires a higher transition temperature where gains in conformational entropy can begin to compensate .",

    "the benefit of this additional labor is that the final parameterization for understanding the nature of competing microscopic interactions becomes considerably less complicated in the end . in particular",
    ", the dcm offers the potential of having transferability of parameters .",
    "parameter transferability is intimately tied to the proper summation of component entropies , which is quantified in the dcm via the long - range underlying mechanical interaction between constraints . from the fitted model parameters ( given in tables [ table : sip ] and [ table : sdp ] ) it is seen from column ( i ) in table [ table : dim ] that a @xmath303 transfer matrix was necessary to describe the mc simulation results .",
    "the large size of the transfer matrix is an indication of a high degree of cooperativity among the hydrogen bonding along the backbone .    in exchange",
    "for the non - transferable nucleation parameter to characterize the degree of cooperativity , it is characterized by a _ rigidity correlation length _ in the dcm .",
    "the rigidity correlation length gives an indication of how far away from a point of interest that perturbations in constraints will lead to little affect at the point of interest .",
    "it can be roughly estimated at the helix - coil transition by locating the crossover point where the shift in transition temperature becomes small as chain length increases . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_lines ] , the rigidity correlation length is estimated to be @xmath304 amino acids for both gas and model - water solvents , also corresponding to the inflection point on the curves for maximum specific heat .",
    "the correlation length is quite long considering that in 1-dimension thermal fluctuations severely reduce the effectiveness of the long - range nature of network rigidity .    the primary motivation for introducing the dcm is to study flexibility and stability in proteins @xcite .",
    "the concept of a rigidity correlation length applies to any topology of constraints , such as found in globular proteins .",
    "the dcm can be used to directly study the affect of hydrogen bonds on protein stability , which has been difficult to ascertain experimentally and theoretically .",
    "not only does the answer depend on the specific thermodynamic conditions , but also on the particular hydrogen bond in question .",
    "stability questions are particularly difficult to answer when there is a high degree of cooperativity in a molecular system .",
    "proteins are particularly interesting , where it has been suggested that the folding pathway is encoded in the hydrogen bond network @xcite .",
    "in addition , mechanical stability probed by single - molecule force spectroscopy appears to depend on the kinetic stability of the hydrogen bond network @xcite  also a cooperative process that can be addressed within a dcm .",
    "more generally , the dcm describes protein folding as a manifestation of a structural self - organization caused by the topological optimization of constraint placement .",
    "indeed , all model calculations presented here suggest that the most probable frameworks correspond to well defined structural units ( such as secondary structure , protein domains , etc ) that change character under different thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the dcm generalizes the @xmath5 generic rigidity calculation to finite temperatures by quantifying constraints with energetic and entropic characteristics .",
    "the effectiveness of a constraint strongly depends on its type and where it is placed in the network in relation to all other constraints .",
    "generic rigidity is then used as an underlying long - range mechanical interaction between constraints , providing the mechanism for the non - additive property of component entropies",
    ". the dcm accounts for fluctuating topological patterns of constraint placements . from a computational point of view , the network rigidity calculations are easy to implement by invoking fast graph - algorithms that are available in two - dimensions @xcite for general networks , and in three dimensions @xcite for bond - bending networks .    in this paper , a dcm applied to the helix - coil transition was considered in detail and compared to the lifson roig model .",
    "thermodynamic state functions are calculated exactly , without recourse in using a nucleation parameter .",
    "the helix - coil transition in peptides is special only in that it can be exactly solved as a 1-dimensional system using a transfer matrix method .",
    "our use of the dcm has been to coarse grain into the smallest number of states necessary to describe the physics at hand .",
    "for example , alpha helix and coil backbone states are used in modeling the helix - coil transition . in this work , 12 different thermodynamic response functions where described well by the dcm using 20 parameters that are independent of temperature and chain length .",
    "the entropic parameters indicate that the degree of cooperativity extends over approximately 40 amino acids .    as a practical application",
    ", the dcm may be able to predict helix formation in proteins with parameters derived from helix - coil transition studies .",
    "the dcm is readily scalable to include more types of interactions , where far more backbone states could have been introduced such as 3 - 10 helix , beta sheet , beta turn , hydrated or not hydrated , buried or surface exposed .",
    "if the dcm parameters are found to be transferable ( as we expect ) flexibility and stability studies on proteins will be far more feasible , because the dcm gets more physics out with fewer parameters .",
    "the dcm has the potential to gain a better understanding of these issues from a mechanical point of view .",
    "more generally , the dcm gives a description of a coarse graining procedure to describe physical systems .",
    "its applicability goes beyond biopolymers , offering a new paradigm not previously available .",
