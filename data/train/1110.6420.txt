    "velocity channels were co - added to produce blue ( @xmath36 to @xmath37 @xmath1 ) , low - velocity ( @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xmath1 ) , and red ( @xmath2100 to @xmath2200  @xmath1 ) images for each of the high - ionization forbidden lines ( figure  [ feiii4659 ] ) . only the high velocity blue and red maps are sensitive to the wind wind interaction that we model in this present work .",
    "the low velocity maps are dominated by slow - moving , extended ejecta produced in the 19th century eruptions , and so are not discussed in detail here .",
    "a refinement to the current model will include a screen of condensations to account for the low - velocity emission .",
    "for each phase , we compared velocity - separated images of [ ]  @xmath264659 , 4702 and [ ]  @xmath275756 , and found remarkable similarities in the blue and red images between the three emission lines ( see figure [ mapping ] for june 2009 , @xmath4012.084 ) .",

    "emission does not fully disappear during periastron ( @xcite ; ) . however , the red emission from [ ] @xmath274659.35 can be contaminated by blue emission from [ ] @xmath274665.75 . likewise , the red emission image of [ ] @xmath274702.85 may be depressed by @xmath274714.47 absorption .",
    "hence , we examined the [ ] maps to ensure little or no red high - ionization emission is present .",
    "figure [ feiii4659 ] shows the time evolution of the blue , low - velocity , and red components of [ ]  @xmath274659 at orbital phases @xmath28 , 12.163 , and 12.323 .",
    "the morphology and geometry of the extended [ ] @xmath274659 emission resolved by _ hst_/stis changes conspicuously as a function of velocity and time .",
    "the blue emission extends along the ne ",
    "sw direction , along @xmath44 , which is similar to what has been suggested from previous sparse hst / stis long - slit observations obtained at different orbital phases across cycle 11 ( g09 , me10 , m10 , m11 ) . at @xmath4012.084 ,",
    "the linear structure is nearly symmetrical about the central region , but at later phases becomes more diffuse , shifting to the s and se .",
    "the red emission is fuzzier , asymmetric and extends primarily to the nnw at each phase .",
    "in contrast , the low - velocity structure is larger and extends diffusely northward .",
    "the low - velocity emission is heavily dominated by emission from the weigelt blobs @xcite and a screen of fainter condensations , located within the @xmath8  wind - blown cavity and thusly obscuring the much fainter wwcz contributions .",
    "while we describe the qualitative changes of the low - velocity component , we defer the detailed modeling of this equatorial emission to a future paper .    for discussion purposes ,",
    "we now isolate the central core ( inner 03@xmath1003 ) as representative of the inner wwcz , and a time - variant extended ( @xmath4503@xmath1003 ) structure as representative of the outer wwcz .",
    "these two regions have very different physical drivers .",
    "the central core exhibits x - ray @xcite and emission , along with strong forbidden line emission .",
    "the outer wwcz , expanding ballistically , is best traced by strong forbidden line emission .",
    "the spatially - extended blue and red emission components are thought to arise in the outer wwcz of eta car , composed of material which was earlier part of the inner wwcz , but over the past 5.5-year period streamed outward . while the primary wind is estimated to have a terminal velocity of @xmath46 @xmath1 , the peak radial velocity component of the forbidden emission lines appears to be @xmath47 @xmath1 . at terminal velocity , the outer wwcz expands at 025 per 5.5-year cycle , hence the current wwcz , even at @xmath400.323 , is within the 03@xmath1003 core .",
    "both the central and extended structures brighten with phase , but they change differently . at @xmath4012.084 ,",
    "the central core accounts for 1/3 of the flux , but brightens only thirty percent by @xmath4012.323 .",
    "the extended emission more than doubles in brightness by @xmath4012.323 .",
    "brightening of the velocity components within the core and extended structures are likewise different .",
    "the brightness of the red component is nearly constant for both the core and the extended structure . the core blue component increases by seventy percent while the extended blue component doubles in brightness .",
    "the core low - velocity component increases only by fifty percent , but the low - velocity extended component triples in brightness and appears to shift further outward from the core .",
    "we note that between @xmath48 12.163 and 12.323 the brightest low - velocity component shifts from the vicinity of weigelt c , noted by , to weigelt b and d.    these brightness changes in the core and extended structures support a scenario in which the current wwcz , namely the direct collision between the winds of @xmath7  and @xmath8 , is contained within the 03 diameter core . after each periastron passage ,",
    "a new secondary - wind - blown cavity must form and expand outward .",
    "the cavity rapidly approaches a balance between the fuv flux of @xmath8  and the cavity wall structure at critical density .",
    "however , the outer cavity wall is very thin , ionizes rapidly and drops in density allowing fuv radiation to pass outward into the much larger , ballistically expanding outer cavity formed in the previous cycle . within this cavity ,",
    "the fuv photons encounter dense walls of primary wind .",
    "the growth in brightness in the blue images , with little change in the red images , indicates expansion in the general direction of the observer .",
    "the larger increase in brightness of the low - velocity images shows where the fuv radiation escapes through the multiple cavities built up by the wind of @xmath8  over many cycles .",
    "proper interpretation of the mapping observations requires a full 3-d dynamical model that accounts for the effects of orbital motion on the wwcz .",
    "here we use full 3-d smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of eta car s colliding winds and radiative transfer codes to compute the intensity in the [ fe iii ] @xmath274659 line projected on the sky for a specified orbital orientation .",
    "the numerical simulations were performed using the same 3-d sph code as that in @xcite with identical parameters except for the mass loss rate of @xmath7 , which we changed to 10@xmath49 m@xmath12 yr@xmath19 .",
    "the two stellar winds in our simulation are also taken to be adiabatic . in order to allow for a more direct comparison to the _ hst _ observations ,",
    "the computational domain is a factor of ten larger than that of @xcite ( i.e. @xmath22 1600 @xmath50 07 ) .",
    "details on the radiative transfer calculations can be found in , .",
    "figures [ model163 ] and [ model323 ] compare the observed blue and red images at @xmath40 12.163 and 12.323 with those predicted by the model for the same velocity intervals . for simplicity ,",
    "the zero reference phase of the spectroscopic cycle @xcite , is assumed to coincide with the zero reference phase of the orbital cycle ( i.e. periastron passage ) in the 3-d sph simulation . in a highly - eccentric binary system like eta car",
    ", the two values should be within a few weeks , which will not affect the overall conclusions @xcite .",
    "the binary orbit is assumed to be oriented with an inclination @xmath51 138 , argument of periapsis @xmath52 270 , and an orbital axis that is aligned at the same pa on the sky as the symmetry axis of the homunculus , 312  @xcite .",
    "the relatively compact central core produces little [ ] emission as densities in the wwcz walls greatly exceed the critical density for efficient emission .",
    "the low - velocity maps , displayed on a flux scale similar to the scales for the blue and red images , would be blank while the observed low velocity emission , heavily dominated by flux from the weigelt blobs and fainter slow - moving clumps , extends to the northwest .",
    "as mentioned in section [ results1 ] , we are refining the model to include such a screen , which will be a topic in a much more encompassing paper .",
    "hence only the red and blue components , successfully replicated in this study , are presented in figures [ model163 ] and [ model323 ] .",
    "the spatial extent of the emission compares quite favorably between the observations and the models ( figures [ model163 ] and [ model323 ] ) , with the blue structures extending projected distances of @xmath17 1  ( 2300 au ) along @xmath53 45  , and the red structures displaced to the ne of the core by @xmath17 01 to 04 ( 230 to 1000 au ) .",
    "we display unreddened fluxes for the model structures due to known uncertainties of reddening .",
    "model fluxes , reddened by @xmath54520 using typical * interstellar * reddening values for stars in the vicinity of eta car agree with the observations within a factor of a few .",
    "this discrepancy could arise due to uncertainties in the assumed stellar parameters of both stars , the reddening law and atomic physics , or systematics in the radiative transfer and hydrodynamical modeling .",
    "however , reddening is highly variable across the carinae complex .",
    "moreover , reddening by dust in the homunculus and within the extended core of eta car  may change on very small scales .",
    "hence we chose to display unreddened model fluxes in figures [ model163 ] and [ model323 ] .",
    "this work represents the first time the extended wwcz of a massive colliding wind binary system has been imaged using high - ionization forbidden emission lines .",
    "spatial- and velocity - extended emission , recorded by individual _",
    "hst_/stis longslit observations at various phases and pas , provided impetus to expand 3-d models to simulate the wind dynamics leading to this emission .",
    "indeed , the initial 3-d dynamical model above produces red and blue images that are similar to those observed . from multiple longslit observations , , and demonstrated that the binary orbit could be fully constrained in 3-d . the noticeable symmetry in velocity for observations taken at pa=38   is now reinforced by the spatial symmetry about the central core in the blue maps .",
    "our modeling , of the observed maps suggests that the argument of periapsis must be closer to @xmath55270  than 240 , thus further reinforcing the result that @xmath8  is on the near side of @xmath7  at apastron , with periastron passage on the far side ( @xcite ; , ; ) .",
    "these and future spatial maps of eta car s high - ionization forbidden emission have the potential to determine the nature of the unseen companion star @xmath8 .",
    "the mass - loss rate of @xmath7  and ionizing flux of photons from @xmath8  determine which regions of eta car s wwcz are photoionized and capable of producing high - ionization forbidden line emission like the forbidden emission from fe@xmath56 , due to 16.2 ev radiation . comparing this mass model loss rates and uv fluxes to those of stellar models for a range of o ( @xcite ; ) and wr",
    "@xcite stars would allow one to obtain a luminosity and temperature for @xmath8 . both the current model and previous individual _",
    "longslit observations show major changes with orbital phase , especially near periastron .",
    "mappings at multiple phases around periastron are therefore essential in order to determine when the fuv radiation from @xmath8  becomes trapped in the dense wind of @xmath7  and the extended high - ionization emission vanishes , and likewise when @xmath8  emerges from @xmath7 s wind and the extended emission returns .",
    "this approach has a number of advantages over previous 1-d modeling efforts to constrain @xmath8 s properties ( @xcite ; ) , which probe the ionization structure of the weigelt blobs .",
    "such 1-d models make considerable assumptions about the physical conditions within the blobs and intervening material , leading to poor constraints on the luminosity of @xmath8 .",
    "eta car  is variable , not only on a 5.5-year period , but has a centuries - long history of variation , including two major eruptions @xcite . these high - ionization forbidden emission lines are powerful tools for monitoring changes in the wwcz , providing quantitative information on the properties of the individual binary components and changes thereof , including a historical record of the recent decade - long mass loss from the primary . following",
    "this system will provide unique information on how a massive star , during the lbv stage , loses much of its mass on its way to becoming a supernova .",
