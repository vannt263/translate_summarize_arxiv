    "renormalization group equations ( rges ) have played an important role in extracting phenomenological predictions of theories valid at very high energy scales .",
    "one of the best known examples of this is the prediction of the weak mixing angle from the simplest susy @xmath1 grand unified theories ( guts ) : the equality of the gauge couplings at @xmath2 , which implies @xmath3 , leads to the measured value of @xmath4 only when these couplings are evolved to the scale @xmath5 relevant to experiments @xcite . since at least the 1980 s , rges have played a role in the analysis of the implications of widely different models of new physics , including supersymmetric models , the subject of this paper @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a novel symmetry that links bosons and fermions , providing a level of synthesis never before attained @xcite .",
    "since supersymmetry implies a super - partner for every chirality state of the standard model ( sm ) with the same internal quantum numbers , it implies an approximate doubling of the degrees of freedom .",
    "supersymmetry , even if softly broken , fixes the dimensionless couplings that determine the tree - level interactions of the superpartners with sm particles and with one another ( _ i.e. _ interactions via mass dimension four ) , so that in this sense the theory is completely predictive .",
    "the interest in susy phenomenology was sparked once it was understood that the susy non - renormalization theorem implied the stability of the hierarchy between the weak and gut or planck scales to radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "since susy is clearly not manifested in the observed spectrum of elementary particles , susy must be ( explicitly or spontaneously ) broken .",
    "moreover , the mass scale of sm superpartners  at least of those that couple sizably to the higgs sector  must be smaller than @xmath6  tev , in order for susy breaking not to destabilize the hard - won hierarchy between the weak and gut scale just mentioned . in view of our complete ignorance of the mechanism of susy breaking , it is expedient to parametrize susy breaking by introducing soft - supersymmetry - breaking ( ssb ) operators with dimension @xmath7 that respect lorentz , gauge and any other symmetries into the effective lagrangian of the theory .",
    "these include gaugino mass parameters , the ssb higgs mass parameter @xmath8 often written as @xmath9 , sfermion mass matrices , and trilinear scalar coupling parameters , usually denoted by @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the proliferation of ssb parameters is a result of our ignorance of how susy breaking is communicated to mssm super - partners .",
    "until this is understood , we are led to resort to a variety of models @xcite .",
    "typically these models , which are based on differing assumptions about _ high scale _ physics , lead to different anstze for the pattern of ssb parameters , in a lagrangian renormalized at this high scale @xmath11 .",
    "this lagrangian can not directly be used to perturbatively extract phenomenological predictions at the @xmath12  gev scale of our experiments , because large logarithms @xmath13 would invalidate ( fixed order ) perturbation theory .",
    "instead , rges are used to evolve all the lagrangian parameters to the scale @xmath14 , and this resulting `` low energy '' lagrangian is used to evaluate its implications @xcite .",
    "since supersymmetric models automatically contain many scalars with the same gauge quantum numbers , there are potential new sources of flavour violation @xcite . within the parametrization of the ssb terms described above ,",
    "these are encapsulated in the sfermion mass matrices and in the @xmath15-parameters ( which may be regarded as matrices in the flavour space ) .",
    "our ultimate goal is to develop a program that will enable a general study of flavour violation , for arbitrary values of ssb parameters at @xmath16 . for the present , we confine ourselves to quark flavour violation .    toward this end , we need to know the rges for all dimensionless and dimensionful parameters .",
    "these are already known , both in the sm @xcite and in the mssm @xcite at the two - loop level .",
    "working to two loop accuracy means that we must include threshold effects in the one - loop rges , since these can numerically be as large as the two loop terms , and perhaps even larger if the sparticle spectrum is very split .",
    "it is in this connection that we extend the existing literature @xcite as described below . as in these studies ,",
    "we implement susy and higgs particle thresholds as step functions in our evaluation of the @xmath0-functions .",
    "we consider first the evolution of the dimensionless couplings .",
    "we assume that for any particle with mass @xmath17 between the weak scale and the scale @xmath11 introduced above , the effective theory used to calculate the @xmath0-function includes this particle if @xmath18 , but not otherwise .",
    "thus , at a high scale @xmath19 above the masses of all sparticles and higgs bosons , the @xmath0-functions are those of the mssm .",
    "as we come down in scale , the susy particles and the heavy higgs bosons decouple one - by - one until we are left with just the sm particles , and the @xmath0-functions for the dimensionless couplings of the sm .",
    "although this sounds quite straightforward in principle , there are several of issues that need to be confronted to implement this program .    * the step - function decoupling of particles at the scale of their mass makes sense for couplings of fields only in their ( at least , approximate ) mass basis .",
    "for instance , in the mssm higgs sector , it is quite clear where the spin zero mass eigenstates @xmath20 or @xmath21 ( or @xmath15 and @xmath22 ) decouple , but the decoupling point for the @xmath23 or @xmath24 fields ( or of the higgsinos ) is ambiguous , because the mass eigenstates are combinations of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 type fields ( or the corresponding higgsinos ) .",
    "moreover , since the higgs bosons and higgsinos acquire mass from different origins , these are not `` diagonalized '' by a common rotation , so that in order to implement the decoupling we must in principle work with higgs boson / higgsino bases that are not susy transforms of one another .",
    "see , however , sec .  [",
    "subsec : massbasis ] for a simplification . *",
    "since we decouple the superpartners but not the lighter sm particles , the effective theory below the scale of the heaviest sparticle `` knows '' about susy breaking , and necessarily includes new dimensionless couplings .",
    "for instance , while in the susy limit , the coupling of the gauge boson to quarks is exactly the same for the corresponding gaugino - quark - squark coupling , below the scale where we begin to decouple heavy particles , these couplings no longer run together . for every gauge coupling @xmath27",
    ", the low energy theory may include additional distinct gaugino - particle - sparticle couplings @xmath28 ( labelled by the scalar @xmath29 ) that evolve differently from @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath30 , below @xmath31 the bino coupling @xmath32 evolves differently from @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 and @xmath34 ( as well as other @xmath35 couplings ) also do not evolve in the same way .",
    "indeed , as we will see later , these couplings also develop flavour - violating components and so become matrices in the flavour - space , which we will denote by @xmath36 , once again labelled by the scalar @xmath29 .",
    "* the proliferation of these new fermion - fermion - scalar couplings also extends to the higgs sector .",
    "for instance , if the heavier higgs bosons @xmath22 , @xmath15 and @xmath21 all decouple at the scale @xmath37 that is hierarchically larger than @xmath38 , and squarks are light , the effective theory in the range @xmath39 includes both higgsino doublets @xmath40 and @xmath41 coupling to various flavours of quarks and squarks , but with quark ( and squark ) pairs coupling only to the light sm - like higgs boson @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we must also have independent higgsino coupling matrices that we denote by @xmath42 , once again , labelled by the scalar .",
    "we see that even for the dimensionless couplings , there are new complications which ( to our knowledge ) have not been included in previous studies , but must be taken into account for a proper implementation of threshold effects into the ( one - loop ) rges .",
    "motivated by the fact that our goal is to study flavour violation in sparticle decays in a general way , we derive the rges for all the relevant dimensionless couplings of the mssm , including flavour - violating superpotential interactions , in this paper .",
    "the number of rges for the dimensionless couplings now expands from those for the three gauge couplings and three yukawa coupling matrices to those for the three gauge couplings , nineteen scalar - fermion - fermion coupling matrices and four higgs - higgsino - gaugino couplings . we should mention that , in addition , there are numerous quartic scalar couplings arising from the @xmath43-terms or the @xmath44-terms in the scalar potential .",
    "although these are given by the `` squares '' of gauge or superpotential yukawa couplings in the susy limit , they will also renormalize differently below the susy thresholds .",
    "we do not discuss the evolution of these couplings which are less important phenomenologically .",
    "fortunately , these couplings do not enter the evolution of the dimensionless couplings that we do consider in this paper .",
    "we derive the rges for the dimensionful parameters , the scalar masses ( matrices in the case of squarks ) , the trilinear coupling matrices and the ssb @xmath9 parameter , which have their own complications , in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "since , as we mentioned above , the threshold effects necessarily involve susy breaking , we derive our rges from the rges in a general ( _ i.e. _ not necessarily supersymmetric ) field theory that have been worked out in the literature .",
    "we use the seminal papers by machacek and vaughn @xcite to derive the rges for the dimensionless couplings , while we use the work by luo , wang and xiao @xcite to derive those for the dimensionful couplings of the mssm .",
    "these studies both use the two component spinor formalism .",
    "in contrast , most phenomenologists are much more familiar with the four - component formalism . to facilitate the use of the general rges , we re - cast the formulae for the rges for dimensionless couplings into four - component notation in sec .",

    "then , while the @xmath0-function for say the hypercharge gauge coupling still depends only on the hypercharge gauge coupling ( because of ward identities , its one - loop evolution is governed by just the `` vacuum polarization corrections '' ) , the @xmath0-functions for the corresponding `` yukawa - like '' couplings @xmath151 of the bino to the fermion - sfermion pair will , in general , depend on gauge as well as _ all _ `` yukawa '' couplings , including those from super - potential interactions .",

    "to implement susy and higgs particle thresholds , we need to have an idea of the spectrum as well as the couplings in the corresponding mass basis .",

    "since the positions of the thresholds only enter logarithmically in the solutions to the rges for the various gauge and `` yukawa - like '' couplings , it suffices to include these in a reasonable approximation .",

    "the couplings of neutral gauge bosons remain flavour - diagonal under renormalization group evolution even at higher loops since any inter - generation couplings would violate current conservation .",
    "this does not mean that their evolution is independent of yukawa couplings : yukawa couplings can , and do , enter the evolution of gauge couplings via two - loop contributions to the rges , but only as a `` flavour - blind trace '' . as a result of this , and the fact that the charged current weak interaction only couples to the left - handed fermions and their superpartners , inter - generation couplings in the charged current weak - interaction are completely determined by the kobayashi - maskawa @xcite ( km ) matrix .",
    "we thus turn to an examination of the flavour structure of fermion - fermion - scalar interactions .",

    "although we will confine ourselves to the quark / squark sector , our considerations readily extend to the lepton sector . in this case , however , the mssm would need to be extended to include effects from the flavour structure of the singlet neutrino / sneutrino mass matrix and interactions .",
    "it may appear simplest to work in a basis where the yukawa coupling matrices in ( [ eq : higgsinoint ] ) are diagonal at one chosen scale , so that quarks are mass eigenstates , rather than in the `` current quark basis '' which we have used to write the superpotential ( [ eq : super ] ) and the interactions ( [ eq : soft ] )  ( [ eq : gauginoint ] ) as well as the rges .",

    "first , we observe that since @xmath359 and @xmath456 start off as real and diagonal at @xmath418 , off - diagonal elements develop only because the km matrix has off - diagonal components .",
    "also , the imaginary parts of @xmath457 develop only via the phase in the km matrix .",
    "next , notice that the `` seed of flavour - violation '' , _",
    "i.e. _ the term involving the km matrix in the rges , which is also the seed for the imaginary part of the off - diagonal elements , enters with opposite signs in the sm and in the mssm rges .",
    "this means that if this seed term causes the real or imaginary part of any off - diagonal element of say the up - type yukawa coupling to evolve with a negative slope in the sm , it would cause the same element to evolve with a positive slope in the mssm , and _ vice - versa_. the evolution for @xmath458 is governed by the sm rge , which causes the real part of an off - diagonal element to evolve to say negative values .",
    "however , for @xmath451 , the evolution is governed by the mssm rge , and the real piece of this yukawa coupling now begins to evolve in the opposite direction , so that it first becomes less negative , then passes through zero and continues to positive values .",
    "of course , at @xmath450 , we must remember to switch from the sm couplings @xmath222 to the mssm couplings @xmath459 .",
    "the imaginary piece of the off - diagonal yukawa couplings similarly passes through zero .",
    "however , we see from the sharp dips in fig .  [",
    "fig : absf ] that the real and imaginary parts have a zero at ( almost ) _ the same value _ of @xmath19 , and furthermore , this location appears independent of the choice of the flavour indices @xmath280 and @xmath84 . to understand this , we need to analyse the equations further .    in the following",

    "as already mentioned , the evolution of the diagonal elements of @xmath460 and @xmath461 is dominantly governed by the last term in these equations which contains the gauge couplings .",
    "if we drop all other terms on the right - hand - side , the rge for the diagonal yukawa terms can be easily integrated , and we find , @xmath470 it is important to note that _ the function @xmath44 is independent of the quark flavour_. ) and ( [ eq : smrge ] ) , these equations take the form , @xmath471 they can be readily integrated to give , @xmath472 where @xmath473 is the coefficient of the one - loop gauge coupling @xmath0-function , @xmath474 . ]    note now that the trace as well as the gauge coupling terms are flavour - independent . assuming that the diagonal yukawas saturate the trace ( remember that we just argued that these diagonal terms are a function only of the gauge couplings @xmath467 ) , we can combine these terms so that the second line on the rhs of ( [ eq : urge ] ) can be written as @xmath475 _ again with @xmath476 being independent of flavour .",
    "_ next , let us look at the term involving the km matrix .",
    "noting that the diagonal elements of @xmath460 and @xmath461 are much larger than the off - diagonal ones , we can write , @xmath477 where @xmath280 and @xmath84 are unsummed , fixed indices . in writing this ,",
    "we have used the reality of the diagonal elements of the yukawa matrices under renormalization group evolution ( discussed below ) . from the analogue of ( [ eq : diag ] ) for @xmath478",

    ", we use the boundary conditions on the sm yukawa couplings to obtain @xmath483 up to the ( common ) susy threshold .",
    "the values of @xmath483 and @xmath496 at @xmath497  tev now serve as the boundary condition for mssm evolution .",
    "the central point of this analysis is that the flavour - dependence is completely captured in the first factor @xmath495 , where @xmath498 corresponds to @xmath418 for sm evolution , and to the susy threshold for mssm evolution .    to the extent that we can ignore the first `` cubic term '' in the @xmath460 rges",
    ", we see that the flavour structure of the evolution of @xmath499 is given by ( [ eq : yukfin ] ) .",
    "we make the following observations .",
    "* this structure is independent of the coefficients in the various terms in the rges as well as independent of which matrices enter into the trace .",
    "the same structure thus obtains for both sm and mssm evolution .",
    "the important approximation was that the diagonal elements of the yukawa matrix dominate in the basis where these are diagonal at the low scale .",
    "( [ eq : yukfin ] ) was obtained without any assumptions about the hierarchical structure of the km matrix .",
    "we can immediately obtain two corollaries from ( [ eq : yukfin ] ) .    1 .",
    "@xmath500 , where the superscripts @xmath77 and @xmath501 respectively denote the real and imaginary parts , is independent of @xmath482 .",
    "@xmath502 is independent of @xmath482 .",
    "our program is to start at @xmath418 with the `` diagonal boundary conditions '' for the sm yukawa couplings and evolve @xmath222 to the scale @xmath176 .",
    "we then scale the up- and down - type yukawa couplings by @xmath503 and @xmath504 , respectively , and finally continue this evolution to higher values of @xmath482 using the mssm rges . by corollary 1 above we see that when the real part of any off - diagonal yukawa coupling vanishes ( as it must for some value of @xmath451 ) , the imaginary part of this coupling also vanishes .",
    "corollary 2 then tells us that the other off - diagonal elements likewise vanish for this same value of @xmath19 .",
    "this is , of course , exactly the qualitative feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : absf ] that we started out to explain .    before turning to other issues ,",
    "let us briefly return to the first term that we have ignored up to now .",
    "if we saturate the product @xmath505 with two diagonal elements in each of three terms and also remember that the diagonal elements are real , _",
    "i.e. _ write @xmath506 , we find that , like terms we have considered up to now , two of these terms do not couple @xmath507 with anything else , while the third term couples @xmath507 to @xmath508 .",
    "( [ eq : yukfin ] ) is thus violated only by this last term .",
    "we have indeed checked that the position of the zeros are not exactly coincident but have a very tiny spread of a few gev not visible on the figure .",
    "we have also checked that increasing the coefficient of the cubic term increases this spread , while altering the other coefficients has no effect on it , in keeping with expectations from our analysis .    our analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : absf ] , up to now , has assumed a common location for the threshold for all non - sm particles which is , of course , not the case in the figure .",
    "it is , however , clear that the bulk of the change in the slope of the curve occurs from the thresholds at 600  gev where the coefficient of the term involving the km matrix changes its sign , causing the magnitudes of the off - diagonal couplings to decrease until they pass through zero , beyond which the magnitude starts increasing once again .",
    "the kink in the various curves at @xmath497  tev marks the position of the second threshold .",
    "it should , therefore , be clear that the location of the zero is largely determined by the spectrum , and is insensitive to other details .",
    "finally , we remark that the imaginary parts of the off - diagonal couplings ( recall that these have their origin in the phase in the km matrix ) may , depending on which matrix element we are considering , be of comparable magnitude to the corresponding real part , or much smaller .",
    "the relative size of the imaginary part is largely determined by the relative size of the imaginary part in the corresponding element of the `` seed term '' , @xmath509 in the rge .",
    "it is easy to see that this `` seed '' is real for the diagonal elements of @xmath510 ( or @xmath511 ) , which , therefore , continue to remain real . for the case study in the figure",
    ", the ( 1,3 ) element has the largest imaginary part @xmath512 , while the imaginary part of other off - diagonal elements is smaller by 36 orders of magnitude over most of the range of @xmath19 .",
    "we should mention that in a complete diagrammatic calculation there would be other non - logarithmic corrections to the couplings not included in our calculation .",
    "the corrections to the diagonal elements of the yukawa coupling matrices are already included in isajet using the formulae in ref .",
    "@xcite , and so will be automatically included when these rges are embedded into the isajet code .",
    "in contrast to a diagrammatic approach , our method ( also the one used in isajet ) automatically sums the potentially large logarithms that arise when the mssm spectrum is significantly split .",
    "we also remark that in fig .",
    "[ fig : absf ] ( as well as in the other figures below ) , we have ignored any finite shifts in the coupling constants coming from the matching of the two effective theories ( with and without the heavy particle ) when we decouple particles at their mass scale @xcite .",
    "this would potentially give jumps in the couplings as we cross the various thresholds which must be taken into account to achieve true two - loop accuracy .",
    "the rges that we have derived are , of course , unaffected .",
    "we now turn to a study of the evolution of the couplings of gauginos and higgsinos to the quark - squark system . above all thresholds , _",
    "i.e _ for @xmath513 in our numerical study , these are equal to the corresponding gauge and quark yukawa couplings , but differ from them for the range of @xmath19 between the lower threshold at the sfermion , higgsino and electroweak gaugino masses and the high threshold . of course",
    ", for @xmath19 values below this lower threshold , the effective theory is the sm and the couplings @xmath514 , @xmath515 , @xmath516 and @xmath517 cease to be meaningful quantitates in our simple - minded approach with thresholds being incorporated by step functions .",
    "note also that because the gluino is the heaviest susy particle in our illustration , there is no @xmath518 coupling . above all thresholds , supersymmetry relates gaugino and gauge couplings so that flavour violation via gaugino interactions is not allowed . for @xmath180 ,",
    "the connection between the gauge couplings and gaugino couplings is broken , and flavour - violating interactions of gauginos are no longer forbidden by any symmetry . although these @xmath232-type couplings start off proportional to unit matrices at @xmath221 , contributions to their renormalization group evolution from terms involving higgs boson and higgsino couplings to quarks and squarks ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ eq .  ( [ app : bgtpur ] ) of the appendix ) , which cancel out if all thetas are set to unity , cause these to develop off - diagonal elements for @xmath180 .",
    "these off - diagonal components of @xmath367 and @xmath519 ( and also of the corresponding yukawa couplings ) induce flavour - violating decays , @xmath520 , of squarks even if there is no explicit flavour - mixing in the ssb sector ( _ i.e. _ all flavour violation is induced via superpotential yukawa couplings as is the case in many models ) , and hence are phenomenologically relevant . in this case , the partial widths for flavour - violating decays will be small , so that these decays will likely be most important for those squarks for which flavour - conserving , tree - level two body decays are kinematically forbidden .",
    "thus , the neutralino in the flavour - violating decay is most likely to be the lsp .",
    "since the lsp is bino - like in many models , it would seem that the couplings @xmath515 would be the most relevant , but this would of course depend on the size of the corresponding off - diagonal component , relative to the same component of the other couplings .",

    "there are several features worth remarking about .    1 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the gaugino coupling matrices vary over the same broad range as the corresponding elements of the yukawa coupling matrices shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : absf ] .",
    "indeed the magnitude of some of these elements considerably exceed the largest element of the quark yukawa coupling matrix .",
    "it would , therefore , be dangerous to simply disregard these when discussing sparticle flavour physics , particularly in models where yukawa couplings are the sole source of flavour violation .",
    "the off - diagonal couplings of the @xmath526 matrix are several orders of magnitude larger than those of @xmath522 .",
    "the reason for this can be traced to the rges for these listed in the appendix .",
    "we see from ( [ app : bgtpq ] ) and ( [ app : bgtpur ] ) that the evolution of the matrices @xmath526 depends on the down - type yukawa couplings , while that of @xmath522 does not have any such contributions . in the basis that we are working in",
    ", these contributions are much larger than those from up - type yukawa matrices ( and larger than those from the gaugino coupling matrices which start off as unit matrices at @xmath176 ) , so that it is no surprise that the off - diagonal elements of @xmath521 attain larger values than those of @xmath522 .",
    "a similar remark applies to the magnitudes of the elements of @xmath523 shown in frame _ b _ ) .",
    "we also see from the figure that the magnitudes of the gaugino coupling matrices are symmetric under the interchange of the two indices .",
    "we have checked that this symmetry is not exact but ( for our illustration ) holds to a few parts per mille .",
    "the reason for the symmetry is that in the course of their evolution starting from a unit matrix at @xmath176 , the gaugino coupling matrices remain ( approximately ) hermitian .",
    "this is simplest to see for the @xmath383 matrices , retaining only the dominant terms involving the down - type higgs and higgsino coupling matrices on the right - hand - side of ( [ app : bgtpq ] ) .",
    "if we now ignore the small difference between the higgs and higgsino coupling matrices in the rge , and keep in mind that the matrices @xmath383 and @xmath527 on the right - hand - side are almost the unit matrices , it is not difficult to see that the gaugino coupling matrices @xmath383 and @xmath527 remain hermitian with , but only with , our approximations . a similar , but somewhat more involved , argument also holds for the off - diagonal elements of @xmath397 , where we have to look at all the terms in ( [ app : bgtpur ] ) since , in the absence of down - type yukawa matrices on the right - hand - side , no single term dominates .",
    "nonetheless , we have checked that if the difference between higgs boson and higgsino coupling matrices on the right - hand - side can be ignored , and the gaugino coupling matrices can be approximated by unit matrices , the renormalization group evolution preserves the ( approximate ) hermiticity of @xmath397 , explaining why the magnitudes of the corresponding off - diagonal elements are symmetric in the flavour indices .",
    "next , we turn to the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath449-matrices . we know that these will deviate from the elements of the corresponding yukawa coupling matrix only below the threshold at @xmath176 , but have magnitudes similar to the corresponding yukawa coupling matrix elements , whose absolute values are shown in fig .",

    "several points are worth noting :    1 .",
    "since the value of the gauge coupling is fixed at @xmath418 in our illustration , the difference between one and two - loop evolution ( without threshold effects ) is seen at the high @xmath19 end where the curves are terminated at @xmath2 defined as the point where the @xmath167 and the scaled hypercharge couplings meet .",
    "notice that @xmath547 is different in the two cases , as is the value of the gauge coupling at @xmath2 .",
    "this relative difference is @xmath548 , roughly the expected magnitude of a higher loop effect .",
    "the full calculation of the evolution depicted by the solid black line differs most from the other two curves at the low end , because we start off with the evolution using the @xmath0-function of the sm and , as we pass through the various thresholds , join up at @xmath176 to the mssm evolution . beyond @xmath176 ,",
    "the full and two - loop curves evolve with the same @xmath0-function , but the latter ends up lower because threshold effects caused it to start off lower at @xmath176 , as can be seen in the inset on the left .",
    "that it ends up so close to the one - loop curve is a coincidence , but its proximity reflects the conventional wisdom that two loop effects in the evolution are numerically comparable in magnitude to the threshold corrections in the evolution at one - loop .",
    "2 .   turning to the gaugino couplings at the low end , the most striking feature is that below @xmath176 , these evolve in the opposite direction to the gauge couplings .",
    "this behaviour can be understood if we recognize that for @xmath549 _ the evolution of the diagonal gaugino couplings now depends on the much larger gluon coupling even at the one - loop level_. as we can see from ( [ app : bgtpq ] ) , the terms involving @xmath550 cancel the terms depending on the qcd coupling constant @xmath551 if @xmath552 .",

    "since supersymmetric theories allow sensible extrapolation to high energy , rges have played a central role in the analysis of many supersymmetric models , generally assumed to reduce to the mssm ( possibly augmented by right - handed neutrino superfields ) in the range between the weak and gut or planck scales .    in this , the first of a series of two papers , we have re - examined the threshold corrections to the rges for the dimensionless couplings of the mssm , incorporating also the effects from flavour mixing of quarks and squarks . above the scale of all new particle thresholds , the effective theory is the mssm , with just three gauge couplings and three different yukawa coupling matrices ( that specify the interactions of matter fermions with higgs bosons ) being the independent dimensionless couplings of the theory .",
    "all other dimensionless couplings , for instance those of gauginos or higgsinos to the fermion - sfermion system , or quartic scalar couplings , are related to these by supersymmetry .",
    "these relations are , however , no longer valid once supersymmetry is broken , so that then the couplings to gauginos and higgsinos will renormalize differently from gauge and yukawa couplings , respectively . in a consistent treatment of threshold corrections , the rges for",
    "these couplings will therefore differ from the rges for the gauge and quark yukawa couplings that are available in the literature .",
    "we have adapted the rges for a general ( _ i.e. _ non - supersymmetric ) field theory @xcite and rewritten them in four - component spinor notation that we use when we obtain the rges of the mssm .",
    "the details of our procedure may be found in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] and [ threshold ] , and the application to the mssm in sec .",
    "[ derive ] .",
    "the complete set of rges for the dimensionless couplings between sm particles and their superpartners ( but not for the quartic couplings of scalars ) is given in the appendix .",
    "these quartic couplings are less important from a phenomenological perspective , though some of these do enter the squark and slepton mass matrices .",
    "the important thing for the present discussion is these do not enter into the rges for the fermion - fermion - scalar couplings , which can then be evolved independently from the quartic couplings .",
    "we have presented some sample numerical results for the evolution of various couplings in sec .",
    "the analysis here is meant only to give a sampling of effects that , to our knowledge , have not been previously pointed out in the literature .",
    "since flavour physics in the sparticle sector has been the main motivation for our analysis , we point out that when threshold effects are included , gauginos are not different from higgsinos in that neutral gauginos also develop flavour - changing couplings to quarks and squarks . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : gaugino ] , while these flavour - violating gaugino couplings vary over several orders of magnitude , they can be comparable , or even larger , than the corresponding couplings to higgs bosons .",
    "an illustration of flavour - violating higgsino couplings is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgsino ] .",
    "the scale - dependence of these is quite different from that of the usual yukawa couplings of quarks to higgs bosons .",
    "we stress that the induced flavour violating couplings of gauginos and higgsinos , evaluated at the scale of any particular squark mass , will contribute to the amplitude for the flavour - violating decay of this squark .",
    "such a contribution is distinct from the usually evaluated contribution from the induced flavour - violation in the squark mass matrix .",
    "both types of contributions need to be included .",
    "finally , we point out one last striking feature of our analysis . we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : gauge ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : yuk ] that the inclusion of susy threshold corrections leads to a difference of a few percent between the flavour - diagonal electroweak couplings of gauginos and gauge bosons , and of higgsinos and higgs bosons , traced to susy qcd contributions in even the 1-loop rges .",
    "this could have a noticeable effect on the evaluation of sparticle masses as well as of thermal relic densities of neutralino dark matter created in the big bang .",
    "in summary , we have presented the rges of the dimensionless couplings of the mssm in this paper . in a follow - up",
    "paper under preparation @xcite , we will present the rges for the dimensionful parameters , again including threshold and flavour - mixing effects .",
    "this complete set will facilitate the examination of flavour phenomenology in susy models with arbitrary anstze for flavour in the ssb sector .",

    "<S> in a theory with broken supersymmetry , gaugino couplings renormalize differently from gauge couplings , as do higgsino couplings from higgs boson couplings . as a result , we expect the gauge ( higgs boson ) couplings and the corresponding gaugino ( higgsino ) couplings to evolve to different values under renormalization group evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we re - examine the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for these couplings in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . to include threshold effects </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the @xmath0-functions using a sequence of ( non - supersymmetric ) effective theories with heavy particles decoupled at the scale of their mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the difference between the sm couplings and their susy cousins that is ignored in the literature may be larger than two - loop effects which are included , and further that renormalization group evolution induces a non - trivial flavour structure in gaugino interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we present here the coupled set of rges for these dimensionless gauge and `` yukawa''-type couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the rges for the dimensionful ssb parameters of the mssm will be presented in a companion paper . </S>"
