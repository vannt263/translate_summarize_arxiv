    "among security tasks , the bit commitment protocol holds a prominent role as it represents a computational primitive for many important information processing protocols .",
    "it is a two - party protocol that consists of two phases : the _ commitment _ and the _ opening _ phases . in the commitment phase ,",
    "one client ( alice ) _ commits _ to a value of a bit ( commits to either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) at a certain moment in time @xmath2 . after performing the commitment , alice finalizes the protocol by revealing ( _ opening _ ) her choice to the other client ( bob ) , at some later moment in time @xmath3 .",
    "the commitment to a certain value could be seen , for instance , as a promise to either perform a certain action in a future moment in time @xmath4 ( e.g. buy a house from bob for a given fixed price @xmath5 )  commitment to @xmath1 , or not ",
    "commitment to @xmath0 .",
    "the protocol has to fulfill three security requirements : alice can not change her commitment later in time , in particular during the opening phase ( the protocol is _ binding _ ) ; bob can not learn alice s commitment before the opening phase ( the protocol is _ concealing _ ) ; if both clients are honest ( if they execute the protocol according to the rules ) , then bob will successfully open alice s commitment ( the protocol is _ viable _ ) .",
    "commitment schemes are nowadays an important phase on several cryptographic protocols , in particular in _ zero - knowledge proof systems _ and _ authentication protocols _",
    "( for a more detailed description , see appendix  [ bit_commitment_applications ] ) .",
    "the idea behind the classical solutions to this problem is to _ lock _",
    "alice s commitment in a secure `` safe '' ( the commitment phase ) , such that without the key it is impossible to break into it , and give that `` safe '' to bob . during the opening phase",
    ", alice gives bob the key , and he learns her commitment .",
    "one way of doing this is to use ordinary keys and locks .",
    "another , to perform the locking by encrypting the commitment , using a secret encryption key . in both cases ,",
    "the solutions have to meet the binding and concealment requirements .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to perform a bit commitment protocol that is unconditionally secure .",
    "if alice chooses to protect her commitment by placing it in a real safe , since there are no unbreakable safes , the protocol would not be unconditionally concealing .",
    "if she chooses to protect her commitment by encrypting it using a secret key known only by her , she can achieve the concealing requirement , but then the protocol would no longer be binding .",
    "namely , no unbreakable encryption scheme is at the same time binding  whatever commitment value alice encrypted during the commitment phase , she can always present a suitable key that would decrypt to either of the two commitment values .",
    "attempts to solve this problem using quantum systems have been done previously  @xcite , but it was shown that no quantum bit commitment protocol can be both unconditionally binding and concealing  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to , using the current technological limitations , perform a practical quantum bit commitment protocol that will be secure in a foreseeable future  @xcite .",
    "the protocol is based on the famous bb84 quantum cryptographic protocol  @xcite .",
    "the proposed protocol is binding , due to the unconditional security of the bb84 protocol  @xcite and the fact that we do not have long - term stable quantum memories , nor do we have apparatuses able to perform non - demolition measurements of photons .",
    "practical bit commitment protocols whose security is based on limited amount of quantum memories were studied previously  @xcite , as well as protocols whose security is based on having imperfect ( due to unavoidable noise ) quantum memories  @xcite .",
    "one such protocol , using entangled states , was recently reported to be experimentally performed  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the above no - go theorem on unconditional security of ( quantum ) bit commitment schemes is applicable only to non - relativistic protocols . using relativistic effects",
    ", it is possible to design an unconditionally secure bit commitment protocol  @xcite , which was recently implemented  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a two - state version of the practical quantum bit commitment protocol based on the b92 cryptographic protocol @xcite .",
    "its practical security relies on the fact that long - term stable quantum memories and non - demolition measurements are currently out of reach .",
    "provided those technological limitations , our protocol is more secure than classical counterparts , as its security is based on physical laws , rather than on computational assumptions .",
    "we also study the effects of noise , source imperfections and measurement errors on the protocol s security .",
    "in particular , we show that adding a certain amount of white noise always increases the chances of a dishonest alice to cheat bob and postpone her decision until the opening phase .",
    "finally , we analyze the security of the protocol in the presence of ( im)perfect non - demolition measurements and noisy / bounded quantum memories .",
    "the protocol is based on quantum complementarity  the impossibility to simultaneously measure two non - commuting observables .",
    "therefore , one has to decide to measure only one out of two possible observables of a physical system , and obtain information about only one of two features of a system .",
    "the choice of measurement can be interpreted as a commitment to a bit value , and the measurement outcome used as a proof of this particular choice ( i.e. commitment ) .",
    "this is somewhat the opposite approach to that used in classical solutions : instead of ( securely ) imprinting the information of a commitment choice into a state of a physical system ( writing down an encrypted message on a piece of paper , for example ) , the choice is done by acquiring information about _ only one out of two _ possible features of a physical system .",
    "this approach has already been used for designing quantum contract signing  @xcite and simultaneous dense coding protocols  @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "the security of the protocols is provided by the laws of physics ( e.g. quantum mechanics ) , rather than by the computational complexity of the decryption schemes .",
    "also , a `` probabilistic '' two - state quantum bit string commitment protocol , based on the same mechanism , was recently proposed  @xcite , in which alice commits to a string of @xmath6 bits , such that bob can learn not more than @xmath7 bits , up to negligible probability ( note that because this protocol is quantum its unconditional security is not implying the existence of unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment schemes , as would be the case for its classical counterpart  @xcite ) . for similar work on coin",
    "tossing and bit - string generation , see  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the commitment and the opening phases , the quantum protocol begins with the _ initialization _ phase , during which bob prepares a number of identical physical two - level systems ( qubits ) on which alice is to perform the commitment measurement ( the same measurement on each qubit ) .",
    "bob sends to alice a number of qubits , each randomly prepared in one of two given quantum states ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) , without revealing any information about the prepared states . during the commitment phase",
    ", alice chooses only one out of two non - commuting observables , @xmath10 or @xmath11 ( given by the two states used by bob , see below ) , measures it on each qubit received from bob , and keeps the record of measurement outcomes .",
    "finally , during the opening phase , she reveals the results to bob , which serves as a proof of her commitment .",
    "we require that the qubit states @xmath8 and @xmath9 used in the protocol are not orthogonal   and @xmath9 are used to design alice s measurement observables @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the relative phase between the two vectors is irrelevant and for simplicity we take it to be zero .",
    "note also that , as the relevant quantity in calculations is @xmath12 , for reasons of simplicity we do not use standard bloch representation of pure qubit states .",
    "a simple substitution @xmath13 in formulas gives results presented below in standard form of bloch representation .",
    "] , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "let us denote the states orthogonal to @xmath8 and @xmath9 as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this way , we defined two ( orthonormal ) bases @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which in turn define two orthogonal observables @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath22 finally , we list the eigenvectors of @xmath11 expressed  , fixing the relative phases between it and states @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be @xmath0 and @xmath25 , respectively . ] in the @xmath26 basis : @xmath27 and vice versa : @xmath28 for some @xmath29",
    ".    we can now give a more detailed description of our two - state practical quantum bit commitment protocol .",
    "it consists of three phases , arranged in chronological order ( @xmath30 ) :    * _ the initialization phase : _ * at time @xmath31 , bob randomly chooses a string of @xmath32 bits @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , and sends a string of @xmath32 qubits to alice , each prepared in the pure state @xmath35 , and emitted at time @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "bob keeps the information of the states @xmath35 of each qubit , as well as the times @xmath36 of the emission of each qubit .",
    "we assume that @xmath38 and that @xmath39 .    * _ the commitment phase : _ * at time @xmath40 , alice starts measuring on _ all _ the qubits received _ only one _ observable , either @xmath10 or @xmath11 , depending on her commitment choice ( @xmath10 corresponds to the commitment to value @xmath0 , @xmath11 to value @xmath1 ) .",
    "she announces the arrival times of each qubit ( which are at the same time the times of measurement of each qubit ; see below for the discussion ) , a string @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , and keeps the record of the measurement results to her , a string @xmath43 , with   @xmath44 .",
    "* _ the opening phase : _ * at time @xmath45 , alice reveals her commitment @xmath46 ( e.g. the measurement observable @xmath47 ) , together with the measurement results @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , to bob .    note that not all qubits sent by bob arrive to and are measured by alice .",
    "thus , @xmath44 , and for each index @xmath50 labeling alice s measurement times @xmath51 and results @xmath48 , there is a corresponding index @xmath52 labeling bob s qubit emission times @xmath53 and corresponding bits @xmath54 .",
    "first , we discuss in more detail the commitment mechanism .",
    "the description of the commitment phase states that measuring @xmath10 corresponds to the commitment to value @xmath0 , while measuring @xmath11 corresponds to the commitment to value @xmath1 . from the expression of measuring observables in terms of the states",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the states orthogonal to them , given by equation ( [ commitment_obs ] ) , we see that when a bit value @xmath55 , defining the qubit s quantum state @xmath35 , `` coincides '' with the measuring observable @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 , then the corresponding measurement outcome @xmath48 , for which @xmath58 , coincides with the bit value @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "this way , we can interpret the measurement outcome @xmath48 as alice s inference of bob s bit value @xmath54 : if the bit value and the observable `` coincide '' , the inference will be right ; otherwise , it will be random   and obtaining result @xmath0 , we are not sure that the qubit was in the state @xmath8 , while obtaining @xmath1 means that the qubit s state was for sure @xmath9 ( and analogously for @xmath11 ) . in other words , when measuring @xmath47 _ all _ qubits prepared in the state @xmath60 will be among those for which the result was @xmath61  with the drawback that some among them will be prepared in the state @xmath9 .",
    "if we are interested in what we call _ unambiguous inference _  when measuring @xmath47 and obtaining @xmath61 we want to be sure the state was @xmath60 , then we simply have to relabel measuring observables . ] .",
    "if by @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , we denote a conditional probability that a result @xmath64 is obtained when measuring observable @xmath47 on state @xmath65 , then the overall conditional probabilities are given by the following expressions ,    * alice measures @xmath10 : @xmath66 * alice measures @xmath11 : @xmath67    thus , the above conditional probabilities give the signature of the commitment : if alice measures @xmath10 , the statistics of her measurement outcomes will be given by ( [ p_0 ] ) ; otherwise , it will be given by ( [ p_1 ] ) .",
    "it also serves as the proof of her commitment , during the opening phase : only if the statistics of @xmath68 , with respect to @xmath69 , is `` close enough '' to @xmath62 , did alice commit to the bit value @xmath61 . if @xmath70 is the number of measurements performed by alice on qubits received in the state @xmath71 , _ with outcome _",
    "@xmath64 , and @xmath72 is the _ total number _ of qubits received in the state @xmath71 , then define @xmath73 . by `` close enough '' to , say , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 commitment ) , we now mean that the probability @xmath76 that the measurement statistics @xmath77 were produced by a random source @xmath74 is bigger than a certain threshold value @xmath78 ( alice did measure @xmath10 )",
    ". this represents bob s criterion to accept alice s commitment to @xmath79 , and analogously for @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , for the protocol to be viable , we require that the statistics @xmath77 which pass the test @xmath81 of committing to value @xmath75 are unlikely to be obtained by measuring @xmath11 , i.e. we require that @xmath82 ( and analogously for statistics that pass the test of committing to @xmath83 )",
    ". the security parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 are to be set by bob and the protocol designer , respectively , depending on the particular equipment used and the desired level of confidence .",
    "let us now discuss the protocol s ( _ practical _ ) security and show that it is indeed both binding and concealing .",
    "the protocol must guarantee that at a certain moment of time @xmath40 , alice commits to a bit value such that bob can not learn her commitment until she reveals it at time @xmath45 , and alice can not change her decision after @xmath40 , in particular at @xmath45 .",
    "alice makes the commitment by measuring one of the two observables , during a period of time @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "the protocol requires that alice announces the arrival times of the qubits . to do so",
    ", she either performs her measurements straight away ( meaning that she commits to a certain value ) , or she performs a non - demolition measurement , thus detecting the presence of a photon without either destroying it nor affecting its polarization state",
    ". however , photonic non - demolition measurements are still in their infancy stage ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite , for instance , one performs a non - demolition measurement in a controlled environment ( photons are in a confined cavity ) .",
    "this type of measurement is thus suitable for computational rather than optical cryptographic purposes .",
    "furthermore , even if alice had access to a non - demolition measuring apparatus , she would need , in order to perform her measurements later in time , to have access to stable long - term quantum memories .",
    "despite recent efforts , current technology allows only for very short - term noisy memories , usually implemented by fiber optic cable ( see fig . 5 in @xcite for an example )",
    ": adding extra fiber optic cable makes the measurements much more prone to errors , and increases the qubit losses exponentially in the length of the cable .",
    "consequently , alice performs her measurements as soon as she receives the qubits sent to her by bob , turning the arrival times of each qubit into the measurement times @xmath51 as well .",
    "therefore , @xmath87 , and for all practical purposes we can say that the commitment in fact occurred at time @xmath40 . note that in the ideal case when all qubits sent by bob arrive to alice and are detected by her , @xmath88 , we have @xmath89 , with @xmath90 being the speed of the qubits and @xmath91 the distance between alice and bob .",
    "for these same reasons , the protocol is binding : alice must perform her measurements as the qubits arrive , and thus she must make a commitment at time @xmath40 , and not later .",
    "otherwise , she could have kept the qubits in a quantum memory and perform her measurements  commit to a value  later in time . on the other hand , as a consequence of the laws of quantum mechanics , there exists no measurement which would provide alice with the knowledge of the states prepared by bob for _ all _ of the received qubits : she can not both know @xmath92 and @xmath93 for every @xmath50 .",
    "thus , after performing her measurements , alice can not pass both the test ( [ p_0 ] ) of committing to the value @xmath0 and the test ( [ p_1 ] ) of committing to the value @xmath1 .",
    "note that it is essential that the commitment tests ( [ p_0 ] ) and ( [ p_1 ] ) contain both @xmath92 and @xmath93 , _ as well as _",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 , otherwise the protocol would not be binding . indeed , alice must both be able to identify states corresponding to her commitment choice _ and _ to have a proper statistics on states not corresponding to her choice .",
    "otherwise , she could trivially pass both tests even without any measurements , by simply setting @xmath96 for all @xmath50 s , in case she wants to pass the test of committing to the value @xmath0 , and @xmath97 otherwise .",
    "regarding the second security requirement , that of concealment , it is obvious that alice s measurements reveal no information about her measurement outcomes , and thus of her commitment , to a spatially distant bob . sending entangled states would obviously not help , due to non - signaling and causality : bob can not infer the choice of alice s local measurement by measuring his part of the entangled pair , spatially distant from alice .",
    "the above discussion of the commitment mechanism , based on quantum complementarity , was done for the ideal case of noiseless channels and perfect sources and measurements  ) . ] . in particular , the expressions ( [ p_0 ] ) and ( [ p_1 ] ) for conditional probabilities are obtained under this assumption . in this and the following section , we will discuss the case of a noisy environment .",
    "regarding a future implementation of the protocol , in which the qubit states are encoded into the polarization of single photons  @xcite , we will discuss the case of optical realizations of the protocol .",
    "nevertheless , our theoretical approach could be easily applied , with suitable small modifications , to other types of physical realizations as well .",
    "first , we will consider optical noise , while in the next section we will discuss non - optical effects , such as imperfect single - photon sources , losses during the transmission and imperfect detectors ( detector efficiency and dark counts ) .",
    "note that in this protocol , unlike the case of quantum cryptography , we are interested in more than just one quantity . quantum bit error rate ( qber ) , used to study the effects of noise in quantum cryptography ( see equations ( @xmath98)-(@xmath99 ) in @xcite , page @xmath100 ) , is the ratio between the wrongly measured versus the total number of qubits received , in case we measure in the _ same basis _ in which the qubits were prepared . in our case , though , we are interested in the ratios , i.e. the ( conditional ) probabilities of both the case of measurement in the same basis , and the case of measurement in a basis different from that in which the qubits were prepared . in the ideal case , the conditional probabilities were given by the expressions ( [ p_0 ] ) and ( [ p_1 ] ) . in the following , we will present the corresponding conditional probabilities for the cases of depolarizing channel , bit - flip and phase - flip channels , and arbitrary unitary evolution . at the end of this section",
    ", we will combine the four contributions into a single one .",
    "the depolarizing channel is a model of white noise : with probability @xmath101 , the state of a system ( in our case qubit ) stays the same , while with probability @xmath102 it becomes totally mixed .",
    "note that in this case , the probability to obtain the result corresponding to the initial state is higher than @xmath101 : even if , after passing the channel , the state of the system turns out to be totally mixed ( which happens with probability @xmath102 ) , there is still non - zero probability to obtain the result corresponding to the initial state . in this case , the probability to obtain the  wrong \" ( e.g. opposite ) result , when measuring in the same basis in which the qubits were prepared is : @xmath103 this is nothing but the optical part of the qber , given by equation ( 34 ) from @xcite : @xmath104 = ( 1-v)/2 . using this formula , where @xmath105 is the  visibility \" parameter , we get that @xmath106 , which is precisely the probability that the state will pass the channel intact - hence the name  visibility \" ( a synonym , in a sense , of  transparency \" ) .",
    "the depolarizing channel has no preferred axis of action , in the sense that its action is the same in each basis of the systems s hilbert space .",
    "the noise is the same along each axis , and is the most dominant type of noise / errors that occur , as it is a model of white noise .",
    "the kraus decomposition ( or the so - called operator - sum representation ; see @xcite , page @xmath107 , section @xmath108 ) of the ( super-)operator representing the depolarizing channel is , for the case of qubit states , given by : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a general mixed state representing the initial qubit state , @xmath111 is the identity operator , and @xmath112 are the standard pauli operators . note that the first equality is the general definition , while the second one is a particular expression for a two - dimensional qubit case . using the above definition ( [ depolarizing ] )",
    ", one obtains the relevant conditional probabilities , analogous to ( [ p_0 ] ) and ( [ p_1 ] ) obtained for the ideal case ( @xmath113 represents the optical part of the quantum bit error rate ) :    * alice measures @xmath10 : @xmath114 * alice measures @xmath11 : @xmath115      the other two types of channels , bit- and phase - flip , are basis dependent .",
    "this means that , in the case of a bit - flip in the @xmath26 basis , it flips ( changes ) the state @xmath8 into @xmath116 ( and vice - versa ) with probability @xmath102 , where , by construction @xmath117 .",
    "but , if the state is a general superposition @xmath118 , the flipped state , @xmath119 , will not in general be orthogonal to the initial state @xmath118 , so it will not be a bit - flip in other bases .",
    "therefore , such noise / errors are expected to occur in cases where we can isolate a preferable axis ( and thus a basis ) , which is the case of a measurement of an observable ( or a preparation of a certain state , which is a basis state of a certain observable ) .",
    "the operator - sum representation of the bit - flip channel is : @xmath120    for simplicity we will not present the relevant conditional probabilities here , since they can be easily derived from the general formula for combined noises , given in subsection [ total_noise_section ] .",
    "note that the above channel flips the basis states @xmath8 into @xmath116 ( and vice - versa ) , such that the matrix representation of the operator @xmath121 in the basis @xmath20 is the pauli matrix @xmath122_{\\mathcal{b}_0}=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]$ ] .",
    "we could also consider a bit - flip channel where states @xmath9 and @xmath123 are flipped , using @xmath124 instead of @xmath121 .",
    "the second basis - dependent operation to model the noise is the phase - flip channel . it",
    " flips \" the phase of one of the two basis vectors .",
    "below , as in the previous case , we fix the basis @xmath26 and represent the flip of the phase of @xmath16 by the operator @xmath125 whose matrix representation is again a pauli matrix @xmath126_{\\mathcal{b}_0}=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{array}\\right]$ ] .",
    "the operator - sum representation of the phase - flip channel is : @xmath127    again , the relevant conditional probabilities are shown in . in analogy with the bit - flip channel , here as",
    "well we could consider a channel @xmath128 given by the operator @xmath129 .",
    "finally , the unitary evolution could be used to model the cases for which we have a constant  rotation \" of the state of a system .",
    "for example , we may send qubits as photons through an optical fibre which , due to bad twisting , rotates the polarization angle by a fixed ratio per unit length  @xcite .",
    "the unitary evolution is given by : @xmath130 where the arbitrary @xmath131 unitary operator is , up to an irrelevant global phase , given by its matrix representation ( say , in the @xmath26 basis ) : @xmath132_{\\mathcal{b}_0 } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } e^{i\\lambda}\\cos \\alpha & -e^{-i\\mu}\\sin \\alpha \\\\",
    "e^{i\\mu}\\sin \\alpha & e^{-i\\lambda}\\cos \\alpha \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath133 $ ] and @xmath134  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath135 is the qber _ in the @xmath26 basis .",
    "_    the relevant conditional probabilities are given in .",
    "the next , and final , step in modeling the optical part of the noise is combining the above four contributions in a single set of formulas for conditional probabilities .",
    "our approach is the following .",
    "the whole apparatus consists of three parts : the sender ( bob ) performing the state preparation using the source of photons , the transmission environment ( transmission through the space , optical fibre , etc . ) , and the receiver ( alice ) performing the measurement using essentially detectors and beam - splitters .    in each of the three parts",
    ", we can have some of the above described types of noise .",
    "the white noise occurs with particular probabilities @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( @xmath102 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 stand for preparation , transmission and measurement , and @xmath141 for depolarizing channel ) , characteristic to the equipment and the environment .",
    "the white noise is a generic type of noise that affects all types of instruments and environments . during the preparation and the measurement",
    ", we can also have basis - dependent noises : when preparing the @xmath8 state , we can have a bit - flip and a phase - flip in the basis @xmath20 , characteristic for this particular preparation procedure .",
    "they occur with the corresponding probabilities @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( @xmath144 and @xmath102 standing for the bit and phase , respectively ; the upper labels are omitted for simplicity ) . when preparing the @xmath9 state , bit- and phase - flips occur in the basis @xmath21 , with the _ same _ probabilities @xmath142 and @xmath143 as in the previous case , since the two - state preparation apparatuses are rotated with respect to each other ( assuming spatial isotropy ) .",
    "in general , bit- and phase - flips could occur along a general axis during the transmission as well , but this is a highly unlikely scenario as usually the transmission environment ( space , optical fibre ) has no preferential axes ( bases ) and thus the noise is not likely to be biased in this manner .",
    "finally , a unitary evolution could occur during the transmission , while it is unlikely to happen in sources and detectors , and is thus ignored in the preparation and measurement phases .",
    "therefore , the overall state of a qubit after  passing through \" the preparation apparatus , transmission environment , and the measurement apparatus , just before the detection , can be obtained by the consecutive application of the following channels :    * depolarizing , bit - flip and phase - flip channels , each with different probabilities @xmath145 , in the preparation apparatus , * depolarizing channel , with probability @xmath146 and unitary rotation , during the transmission , and * depolarizing , bit - flip and phase - flip channels , each with different probabilities @xmath147 , during the measurements .    in each part of the apparatus ( sender , transmission environment and receiver )",
    "different channels model different noises that occur at the same time , which is assured by their commutativity . indeed ,",
    "all the commutation relations needed are satisfied : depolarizing , bit- and phase - flips channels commute with each other ( a consequence of commutation relations for the pauli matrices and the particular kraus representations of the three channels in terms of pauli matrices , see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "thus , the order of their application during the preparation and measurement are irrelevant .",
    "in particular , we can apply the depolarizing channel occurring during the preparation just before the transmission , and the one occurring during the measurement just after the transmission . depolarizing channel and unitary evolution commute as well ( the white noise is isotropic ) , so that we can treat the white noise by only one parameter : since @xmath148 , we have @xmath149 . on the other hand , the bit- and phase - flips _",
    "do not _ commute with the unitary evolution ( as no axis - dependent operation commutes with the unitary evolution , in general ) .    combining the overall noise in the apparatus , depending on the preparation procedure ( preparing either @xmath8 of the @xmath26 basis , or @xmath9 of the @xmath150 basis )",
    ", we have four distinct channels :    * @xmath151 , when measuring @xmath10 and preparing @xmath8 , * @xmath152 , when measuring @xmath10 and preparing @xmath9 , * @xmath153 , when measuring @xmath11 and preparing @xmath8 , * @xmath154 , when measuring @xmath11 and preparing @xmath9 .",

    "it is interesting to analyze the reasons for such behavior of the relative entropy , and why is it not present in the case of the fidelity . for simplicity , we will analyze only the case when an honest strategy is executed in noiseless circumstances , the general case of both honest and cheating agents are subjected to noise is straightforward .",
    "first , we note that unlike the standard quantum cryptographic protocols , such as bb84 @xcite and b92 @xcite , where the only relevant results are those obtained for the cases when the basis of the states sent by bob and of the observable measured by alice coincide , here we are interested in the results when the two are not the same . in other words",

    "this means that both the fidelity increase , and the relative entropy decrease , will occur between the pairs of the cross terms for certain range of the noise parameter @xmath195 .",
    "nevertheless , these contributions will affect differently the overall average fidelity @xmath201 and the average relative entropy @xmath210 : the former will always decrease with @xmath195 , while the latter will experience a decrease for a rather broad range of values of @xmath195 .",
    "mathematically , this is just an effect of scaling : fidelity uses a linear scale , and the cross terms are not powerful enough to overcome the behavior of non - cross terms , whereas the relative entropy uses a logarithmic scale , and allows the cross terms to express themselves better .",
    "in section [ the_protocol ] we presented a general description of bob s decision process : in order to accept alice s commitment to , say , value @xmath0 , the probability that the statistics @xmath169 , formed by the data communicated by alice , was obtained by measuring @xmath10 must be bigger than a certain threshold value @xmath84 .",
    "in addition to that , the probability that the statistics @xmath169 , which passed bob s test of committing to @xmath0 , was obtained by measuring @xmath11 should be smaller than @xmath85 ( the protocol is viable ) .",
    "after analyzing the effects of noise and imperfect photon sources and measurement apparatuses , as well as alice s optimal cheating strategy , we can study in more detail bob s criteria for deciding if the results obtained from alice confirm that she committed to 0 , or to 1 , or that the results show that she tried to cheat .",
    "we can also check the minimum number of photons that need to be measured by alice for bob s decisions not to be compromised by alice s eventual attempt to cheat .    for simplicity",
    ", we will analyze the criterion for deciding if given measurement results confirm that alice committed to @xmath0 .",
    "the total number of measurement outcomes is @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is the number of measurements on photons sent in the state @xmath8 , and analogously for @xmath246 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath247 is the number of outcomes @xmath0 , when the state @xmath8 is sent , while @xmath248 is the number of outcomes @xmath1 ( and analogously for @xmath249 ) .",
    "this way , we have two ( conditional ) probability distributions : @xmath250        to analyze the protocol s security against alice s attempt to cheat , we introduce the similar criterion to the one given by ( [ viable ] ) : @xmath251 note that it is more likely to produce statistics that look as if being obtained by committing to @xmath0 by measuring @xmath252 than by measuring @xmath11 . therefore , we will only consider the criterion that the statistics @xmath253 were obtained by measuring @xmath10 , and not by measuring @xmath252 .",

    "we presented a two - state practical quantum bit commitment protocol .",
    "we discussed the effects of both optical and non - optical noise . in the latter case",
    ", we showed that finite detector efficiency , dark counts , imperfect single - photon sources and transmission losses have essentially the same effects as in the case of standard quantum cryptography . to quantitatively analyze the effects of the optical part of the noise",
    ", we used the fidelity and the relative entropy , two information - theoretic measures of probability distribution distinguishability . as a corollary to our study , using the two distinguishability measures",
    "only , we obtained the well - known result that the optimal value of the angle @xmath194 between the two quantum states used in the protocol is @xmath204 .",
    "we also showed a somewhat counter - intuitive result that adding a certain amount of white noise can always help a cheating alice to postpone her commitment until the opening phase .",
    "this effect is a result of the comparison of the results of measurements in cases when the measurement basis do not coincide with the basis from which the state is sent .",
    "although it can be seen by looking at the behavior of both the fidelity and the relative entropy , when averaging over all the possible cases , only the expected relative entropy retains the signature of this effect . finally , we analyzed the protocol s security when alice has access to ( im)perfect non - demolition measurements and noisy / bounded memories , and showed that the protocol is robust against such possible attacks .      in this appendix , we present a simple example of the application of bit commitment to authentication protocols based on zero - knowledge proof systems .",
    "suppose alice wants to authenticate herself to bob , by proving to bob that she knows a solution to a difficult mathematical problem , without actually revealing the solution ( thus the name zero - knowledge proof ) .",
    "this requirement is crucial : the knowledge alice has is unique to her ( the problem is difficult , so others can not solve it _ in real time _ ) , and is used as a mean of identification .",
    "if she discloses it to bob , he can in the future falsely present himself as alice , which she would like to prevent .",
    "consider the following mathematical problem ( the so - called _ coloring problem _ ) : given a graph @xmath337 , where @xmath105 is the set of vertices and @xmath338 the set of edges , and three colors @xmath339  red , yellow and blue  find a coloring @xmath340 , such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color , @xmath341 .",
    "this is known to be a hard problem , in fact it is an np - complete problem ( see for example @xcite , page @xmath342 ) : if only a graph is given , finding a proper coloring using today s best algorithms requires exponential time , with respect to the graphs complexity .",
    "therefore , it is for all practical purposes safe to assume that alice is the only person who knows a coloring , and therefore she can use it as her personal identifier .    the way to prove to bob that she indeed knows the coloring @xmath343 , without actually revealing this information , is the following .",
    "the protocol is probabilistic , consisting of @xmath6 steps , such that the probability that alice cheats ( convinces bob she knows the coloring , without actually knowing @xmath343 ) approaches to zero exponentially fast , with respect to the number of steps @xmath6 .",
    "each step consists of three consecutive parts :    1 .",
    "alice randomly chooses a permutation @xmath344 , sets a new coloring @xmath345 , and * commits * to it : writes down on a piece of paper the colors , according to new coloring @xmath346 , of all the vertices of a ( publicly known ) graph @xmath347 , _ locks _ it in a secure `` safe '' , keeps the key with her , and gives the `` safe '' to bob .",
    "she can do so by committing to a string of @xmath348 bits , where @xmath32 is the number of vertices of @xmath347 : assuming alice and bob agreed prior to the protocol on a particular enumeration of the graph s vertices , each @xmath50-th pair of bits , with @xmath349 , defines the color of the @xmath50-th vertex ( obviously , this is not an optimal encryption ) ; this way , each bit is locked in a different `` safe '' , for which a different key is produced .",
    "bob chooses an edge @xmath350 and challenges alice to show him their respective colors .",
    "alice * opens * the values of the bit pairs corresponding to the vertex @xmath351 and the vertex @xmath90 ( gives the keys for the corresponding bits ) , thus disclosing to bob the colors @xmath352 and @xmath353 . if they are the same , alice failed to pass the test and bob terminates the procedure",
    "otherwise , they repeat the procedure until bob is satisfied .",
    "obviously , alice can pass the above test only if she indeed knows the coloring @xmath343 of the graph @xmath347 .",
    "otherwise , she can only try to partially color the graph ( properly , so that the adjacent vertices have different colors ) , hoping that bob will not choose vertices that she colored with the same color . if the probability to pass the test in a single step of the protocol is @xmath354 , then the probability to pass the test goes to zero exponentially fast with the number of steps @xmath6 of the protocol , as @xmath355 .",
    "note that although in each step of the protocol bob learns a coloring of one pair of vertices , after @xmath6 steps he still did not learn the coloring of @xmath6 vertices , as in each step alice chooses different coloring @xmath345 , given by a permutation @xmath356 , unknown to bob .",
    "note the essential importance that alice s commitment is binding  otherwise , she could , upon learning bob s choice of vertices @xmath351 and @xmath90 , change her commitment and choose the two colors to be different .",
    "also , it is important that the protocol is concealing  otherwise , bob would be able to learn a coloring of graph @xmath347 , and thus , in the future , impersonate alice .",
    "this concept of a cryptographic commitment can be traced back to the early 80 s , with the works of shamir , rivest and adleman @xcite , along with those of blum @xcite and finally of even @xcite where the concept was first named .",
    "nowadays , it has found its way into several protocols of many diverse natures , such as e - voting protocols @xcite , the tesla authentication protocol @xcite , and the schnorr protocol @xcite on which part of microsoft s u - prove system is based @xcite .      in this appendix",
    ", we evaluate the non - optical contributions @xmath357 , for @xmath329 .",
    "as noted when discussing the depolarizing channel , the two out of four probabilities are nothing but the quantum bit error rate , @xmath358 , while the other two are then straightforward to obtain , @xmath359 and @xmath360 ( note that , by definition , @xmath361 and @xmath362 ) . for example , let alice measure @xmath10 . then , we are interested in cases when result @xmath1 is obtained for qubits in state @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath363 be the total number of qubits received in the state @xmath8 , and let @xmath364 be the number of qubits received in the state @xmath8 for which the wrong result @xmath1 is obtained , during the time interval @xmath365 .",
    "then , the qber is given by : @xmath366 here @xmath367 and @xmath368 are the total and the error rates , respectively , for the qubits received in the state @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath369 is the overall source rate , including both @xmath8 and @xmath9 states , then @xmath370 since bob sends on average equal number of @xmath8 and @xmath9 states . the total rate ( number / time ) of qubits sent in either @xmath8 or @xmath9 state ( given by @xmath371 ) , that were not absorbed and that managed to arrive to detectors ( given by @xmath372 ) and were detected ( given by @xmath373 ) : @xmath374 here , @xmath375 is the pulse rate ( the number of `` attempts '' to send a photon , per time ) , and @xmath306 is the mean number of photons per pulse",
    "thus , @xmath371 is the number of photons sent , in the unit of time .",
    "the probability that a sent photon arrives to a detector is @xmath376 ( @xmath84 is the absorption coefficient , and @xmath377 is the transmission distance , i.e. length of an optical cable ) . finally , the detector efficiency @xmath373 is the probability that a photon that arrived to a detector is actually detected . note that @xmath378 : we ignore the low probable cases of sending two or more photons per pulse .    in general , @xmath379 ,",
    "but here we are only interested in the error arising due to dark counts .",
    "we have @xmath380 here , @xmath381 is the probability that a wrong detector will click ; @xmath382 is the rate of photons sent in the `` right '' state ( in our case @xmath8 ) ; @xmath383 is the probability that a photon is not detected ( when dark counts are relevant ! ) .",
    "note that the probability that a photon arrives to detectors and is efficiently detected is small , @xmath384 .",
    "also , we neglect the less probable cases of `` right '' dark counts , when a photon does not arrive to detectors .",
