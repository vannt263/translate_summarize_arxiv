    "we study relations between a lvy process @xmath11 , its quadratic variation process @xmath12 and its maximal jump processes , with particular interest in how these processes , and how positive and negative parts of the @xmath3 process , interact .",
    "representations of distributions related to these processes are calculated and used as a basis for making asymptotic ( small time ) comparisons in their behaviours .",
    "a convenient way of proceeding is to derive identities for the distributions of @xmath0 modified by subtracting a number of its largest jumps , or its jumps of largest modulus , up until time @xmath13 , joint with @xmath1 , modified similarly .",
    "these identities are obtained by considering the poisson point process of jumps of @xmath3 , allowing for possible ties in the order statistics of the jumps .",
    "the distributions thus obtained enable the study of a wide variety of small or large time kinds of behaviour of @xmath3 .",
    "as an application , we investigate `` self - normalised '' versions of @xmath0 , giving a comprehensive analysis of the behaviour of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath2 , and similarly with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath16 .",
    "two extreme situations are considered ; first , when @xmath3 is of comparable size to a maximal jump process , for example , @xmath17 as @xmath18 ; or , alternatively , when @xmath3 dominates a maximal jump process , in the sense that @xmath19 as @xmath2 ; and similarly with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath16 , and/or @xmath20 replaced by @xmath21 .",
    "complementary to these is the way the largest positive and negative jumps interact with each other .",
    "such results can be seen as continuations in one way or another of a growing literature in this area which has some classical antecedents .",
    "the original developments occurred in the context of random walks , where the concept of `` trimming '' by removing extremes from a sample sum has been studied extensively in the past .",
    "our particular emphasis on the ratio of the process to its extremes goes back in the random walk situation to results of darling @xcite and arov and bobrov @xcite .",
    "later , maller and resnick @xcite gave conditions for a random walk to be comparable in magnitude to its large values ( a heavy - tailed situation ) , while kesten and maller @xcite studied the other end of the spectrum , when the sum dominates its large values ( see table  1 of @xcite for a convenient summary ) .",
    "subsequent to these papers there was much development in the general area of trimmed sums , especially concerning heavy tailed distributions ; see , for example , csrg , haeusler and mason @xcite , berkes and horvth @xcite , berkes , horvth and schauer @xcite , and griffin and pruitt @xcite .",
    "we mention in this context also results of silvestrov and teugels @xcite concerning sums and maxima of random walks and triangular arrays , and ladoucette and teugels @xcite for an insurance application .",
    "there are also recent results about the st .",
    "petersburg game ; gut and martin - lf @xcite give a `` maxtrimmed '' version of the game , while fukker , gyrfi and kevei @xcite determine the limit distribution of the st .",
    "petersburg sum conditioned on its maximum .",
    "cs \" org and simons @xcite give a review of the later st .",
    "petersburg literature .    for almost sure versions of particular kinds of sum / max relationships , see feller @xcite , kesten and maller @xcite and pruitt @xcite .",
    "studies of small time or local behaviour of lvy processes go back to the work of lvy and khintchine @xcite , in the 1930s .",
    "more recent work , relevant to our topic , includes that of doney @xcite , who gives conditions for a lvy process @xmath3 to remain positive near 0 with probability approaching 1 , and andrew @xcite , who similarly analyses the behaviours of the positive and negative jump processes near 0 .",
    "there is a connection also with results of bertoin @xcite , who in studying regularity of a lvy process @xmath3 at 0 was concerned with the dominance of the positive part of @xmath3 over its negative part , when @xmath3 is of bounded variation . for further background along these lines",
    ", we refer to doney @xcite .    despite all this activity",
    ", there seems to have been little done so far by way of relating the lvy process directly to its large jumps , as we do herein . of course",
    ", our methods rely substantially on previously developed foundational work .",
    "our representations of the trimmed lvy process , for example , are inspired by those of lepage @xcite , lepage , woodroofe and zinn @xcite and mori @xcite for trimmed sums via order statistics , and khintchine s @xcite inverse lvy measure method .",
    "( the corresponding representations are incorporated in our lemma [ chain ] . ) in another direction , rosiski @xcite collects a number of alternative series representations for lvy processes , especially with a view to simulation of the process .",

    ", it is convenient to work with the processes having the @xmath57 largest jumps , or the @xmath57 jumps largest in modulus , subtracted .",
    "these `` trimmed '' processes are no longer lvy processes , but we can give useful representations for their marginal distributions .",
