    "the eso - sculptor survey @xcite provides photometric and spectroscopic data of galaxies from a narrow , but deep , patch of the sky .",
    "data were gathered at la silla observatory ( eso ) , using both the 3.6 m telescope and the ntt .",
    "the photometric catalogue covers a continuous strip of 1.53@xmath0 ( r.a . )",
    "@xmath1 0.24@xmath0 ( dec . ) @xmath2 deg@xmath3 in the sculptor constellation , with center ( j2000 ) @xmath4 21@xmath5 , @xmath6 , and 17@xmath0 from the south galactic pole .",
    "a detailed description of the construction and reduction of the photometric catalogue can be found in @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic catalogue contains the spectra and redshifts of @xmath7 galaxies with r = 20.5 , obtained using multi - slit spectroscopy .",
    "details on the reduction of the spectroscopic data are in @xcite .",
    "the ess has already provided some results on our view of the distribution of galaxies at large - scale to @xmath8 @xcite . here",
    "we describe recent results on the proportion and distribution of the different types of galaxies , provided by a spectral classification approach based on the principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite .",
    "this spectral classification is fundamental to have insights on the distribution of different galaxy types which populate the large - scale structures up to @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , it allows to compute k - corrections which in turn allow to have rest - frame magnitudes to construct the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "these main results follow .",
    "understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies @xcite requires a detailed knowledge of the different galaxy populations as a function of redshift and in terms of the local density . in order to obtain an unbiased description of the different galaxy populations for the ess",
    ", we have used a spectral classification approach which is more tightly related to the underlying physics and to the stellar populations which characterize the galaxies , than would be a morphological classification .",
    "morphological classifications also have the inconvenient of being filter and redshift dependent . the pca spectral classification for the ess",
    "was made using only spectra taken during spectro - photometric nights , because pca galaxy spectral types are partly determined by the shape of the continuum @xcite .",
    "a sub - sample of 330 spectra were analyzed in the spectral range @xmath9  , where the best compromise in terms of spectral coverage and number of spectra is obtained .",
    "the pca allows to generate a _ spectral classification plane _ for galaxies , which provides a continuous spectral sequence for the ess ( labeled from i [ early types ] to vi [ late types ] ) .",
    "all details on the ess spectral classification are provided in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the ess spectral types as a function of redshift , shows that there is _ no _ significant evolution of different spectral types up to @xmath8 . except for an excess of early - type galaxies at @xmath10 ( caused by a large galaxy concentration ) ,",
    "the distribution per redshift is nearly uniform for each spectral type as a function of redshift ( see figure [ types_z_ra ] ) .",
    "another important result is related to the morphology - density relationship @xcite .",
    "the distribution of different spectral types as a function of the local density shows that most of the early - type galaxies ( @xmath11 ) are associated to galaxy groups .",
    "late - type galaxies , on the other hand , occupy nearly uniformly both the low and high density regions .",
    "the projection of spectrophotometric templates onto the ess classification plane @xcite allows to compute k - corrections based on the spectral classification .",
    "this analysis requires the use of synthetic spectra which allow to `` extrapolate '' the ess spectra in the standard filters when these are not included in the spectral range of the observed spectra .",
    "we have used the pegase models @xcite using a star formation rate proportional to the amount of gas , and solar metallicity .",
    "ages range from 0.1 gyr to 16 gyr . for each ess spectrum ,",
    "the closest projected model onto the classification plane ( with the same wavelength interval as for the ess spectrum ) is taken as its most similar model spectrum .",
    "synthetic photometry is done onto the model spectra using the b@xmath12 , v@xmath12 and r@xmath13 ess passbands and k - corrections are computed following their definition @xcite .",
    "although this approach depends on the model which is used , the source of difference from one model to another can be controled .",
    "these k - corrections are more reliable than those obtained by the standard approach of using morphological classification and making strong hypotheses on the relationship between the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and the morphological types . measuring the k - corrections",
    "is one of the fundamental steps to construct the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "the ess lf was calculated using standard maximum likelihood techniques , including a non - parameterized ( eep method , @xcite ) and a parameterized functional form ( using the sty method , @xcite ) . for the latter , we adopt the schechter function .",
    "maximum likelihood methods ensure that the lf is not biased by the large - scale inhomogeneities present in the catalogue .",
    "the best - fit schechter function for the ess lf in r@xmath13 ( m@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 mpc@xmath17 ( q@xmath18 , h@xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 ) is shown as a bold line in figure [ lf_r ] .",
    "symbols represent the eep non parameterized lf .",
    "the 1-sigma error ellipse for the schechter parameters is shown in the inset .",
    "the r@xmath13 band lf was constructed from 327 ess galaxies with pca spectral types , and corrected for incompleteness effects following the method described in @xcite .",
    "figure 2 also shows the lf of other surveys , transformed into the r@xmath13 band .",
    "the lf for the ess is in good agreement with the lf for the cnoc1 survey ( @xcite , long - dashed line ) , the eso - slice project ( hereafter esp , @xcite ; dotted line ) , and the century survey ( @xcite , short - dashed line ) .",
    "the lf for the lcrs ( @xcite , dash - dotted line ) is different from the other lfs , in particular at the faint end .",
    "selection effects in that survey are probably responsible for the lost of a large number of ( faint ) blue galaxies @xcite . like in other surveys ( in particular the esp and the cnoc1 survey ) , we note that the faint end of the lf follows an exponential form for magnitudes fainter than m@xmath21 .",
    "most of the galaxies which occupy this magnitude range are galaxies with spectral types later than iv ( see figure [ types_z_ra ] ) .",
    "82% of these galaxies show evidence for present star formation , as measured by the [ oii]3727  emission line .",
    "more than 80% of the galaxies which have m@xmath22 m@xmath23 have spectral types earlier than iii , and very few ( @xmath242% ) show evidence for star formation .",
