    "the field equations , derived independently by a.einstein @xcite and d.hilbert @xcite , form the basis of the general relativity . soon after these equations had appeared in 1915 ( see @xcite for the history of invention ) some very important particular solutions were found , yet not much has been known on their solution space before e.cartans contribution .    in correspondence with a.einstein @xcite he established involutivity of various field equations .",
    "cartan approached this through his theory of exterior differential systems , namely by calculating cartan characters and verifying that they pass the cartan test .",
    "this is quite an involved work .",
    "detailed proof of this is contained in @xcite ( see also @xcite ; quite a different proof of involutivity for einstein , yang - mills and other equations is contained in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we prove involutivity of the field equations using the formal theory of differential equations @xcite : we calculate all spencer cohomology of the system and check their vanishing in the prescribed range ( together with vanishing of the structure tensor ) . by serre",
    "s contribution to @xcite this is equivalent to cartan test .",
    "since chasing diagrams is considered nowadays standard , this turns out to be a reasonable path .",
    "let us notice that up to now the spencer @xmath0-cohomology has never been evaluated for the field equations .",
    "we do our calculations for both einstein and einstein - maxwell system , and also encompass such systems as pure radiation and dust .",
    "we start with vacuum or source - free equations and then impose additional fields , proving involutivity of various field equations .",
    "we relate our calculations to those of cartan which is not obvious , since the two theories  cartan and spencer  though accepted being equivalent , are not in direct correspondence .",
    "finally we derive some simple but important implications using the cartan - khler theorem .",
    "let us mention that in his papers cartan mostly considers the so - called unified field theory based on distant parallelism , which corresponds to einstein system with non - zero torsion , so that the number of differential equations in the system is @xmath1 , not @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) as in the usual einstein and einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "involutivity of these two latter do not follow from involutivity of the former upon a specification .",
    "in addition , cartan arguments by exhibiting relations between the equations but not proving they are all .",
    "the formal theory approach , adapted here , provides both rigorous and economic way to prove involutivity .",
    "we will consider here only the theory of systems of pdes of the same order @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the general theory , developed in , shall be useful for other purposes .",
    "thus let @xmath6 be a submanifold in the space of @xmath5-jets of sections of a bundle @xmath7 , subject to certain regularity assumptions , which include the claim that @xmath8 is submersion .",
    "we let @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 , where the latter space is the prolongation defined as @xmath13_x^l\\in j^l\\pi\\,:\\text { jet - prolongation } j^k(s ) \\text { is tangent to } { \\mathcal{e}}_k\\text { at } [ s]_x^k\\text { with order } ( l - k)\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath14_x^k$ ] is the @xmath5-jet of the ( local ) section @xmath15 .",
    "equation @xmath16 is called formally integrable if all the projections @xmath17 are submersions .",
    "let us denote by @xmath18 the tangent space to the fiber of @xmath19 and by @xmath20 the tangent space to @xmath21 .",
    "then the symbol spaces @xmath22 are the kernels of @xmath23 .",
    "we obviously have @xmath24 for @xmath25 and the space @xmath26 is determined by the equation , however the higher index spaces are difficult to calculate without knowledge of formal integrability .",
    "instead one considers formal prolongations defined as @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "these symbols are united into the spencer @xmath0-complex @xmath29 with morphisms @xmath0 being the symbols of the de rham operator .",
    "the cohomology at the term @xmath30 is denoted by @xmath31 and is called spencer @xmath0-cohomology of @xmath16 .",
    "formal theory of pdes describes obstructions to formal integrability as elements @xmath32 , called curvature , torsion , structure functions or weyl tensors .",
    "their vanishing is equivalent to formal integrability ( and in certain cases to local integrability ) .",
    "symbolic system @xmath33 is called involutive if @xmath34 for all @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this is equivalent to fulfillment of cartan test for the corresponding eds ( which in turn means a pde system of the 1st order ) .",
    "equation @xmath16 is called involutive if its symbolic system is involutive and in addition the only obstruction @xmath37 vanishes .",
    "thus involutive systems are formally integrable .",
    "advantage of involutive systems is that compatibility conditions should be calculated only at one order , while in general they exist in different places and one shall carry the whole prolongation - projection method through .",
    "fortunately many equations of mathematical physics are involutive ( this can be easily checked for all determined and underdetermined equations ) and we are going to prove this for relativity equations .",
    "we run the setup very briefly , referring to plentiful books on differential geometry and relativity for details , e.g. @xcite .",
    "let @xmath21 be a ( 4-dimensional in physical applications ) manifold , @xmath38 pseudo - riemannian tensor ( for relativity : of lorentz signature ( 1,3 ) ) with ricci tensor @xmath39 and scalar curvature @xmath40 , @xmath41 a cosmological constant and @xmath42 the energy - momenta tensor .",
    "the einstein equations @xcite are : @xmath43 we will assume at first that @xmath42 is a given tensor ( in some models like electromagnetic it is traceless , which implies that the scalar curvature @xmath40 is constant , but in general it is not so ) , and only the metric @xmath38 is unknown ( further on we ll treat the case , when @xmath42 depends on unknowns fields entering the equations )",
    ". we can re - write ( [ e ] ) as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , is the gravitational operator is the tangent bundle to @xmath21 and @xmath47 is the cotangent bundle .",
    "@xmath48 is the bundle of non - degenerate quadrics ( not necessary positive definite ) . ] and",
    "bianchi identity reads @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the divergence operator on symmetric tensors , so that @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "this implies the following conservation law : @xmath54 this is the first order pde w.r.t .",
    "@xmath38 and so system ( [ e ] ) is not involutive unless @xmath55 ( indeed , we get a non - trivial equation of lower order than ( [ e ] ) , see appendix for more details on this ) .",
    "thus in what follows in this section we ll concentrate on the vacuum case$ ] of ( [ e ] ) and change the equation to @xmath56=\\varphi^*\\mathcal{t}$ ] , where @xmath57 is a diffeomorphism , so that @xmath42 is given while @xmath58 unknown .",
    "this system ( coupled with compatibility @xmath59 ) is already involutive for any non - degenerate @xmath42  see section [ s5 ] .",
    "detruck @xcite proves solvability of ( [ e ] ) differently  by establishing involutivity of its prolongation - projection ( [ e])+([divt ] ) .",
    "[ det ] ] : @xmath55 .",
    "tracing ( [ e ] ) by @xmath38 yields @xmath60 , so that the einstein equation @xmath16 is equivalent to @xmath61 to understand this equation we need to study solvability of the ricci operator @xmath62 which gives rise to the sequence of operators @xmath63 with symbols @xmath64 .",
    "the symbol of the ricci operator was described in @xcite and it equals ( we choose @xmath65 ; it suffices to define the map on decomposable quadrics ) @xmath66 which is clearly an epimorphic map for any signature of @xmath38 .",
    "the prolongation @xmath67 is not epimorphic for @xmath68 as follows from the bianchi identity .",
    "symbols of the einstein equations ( [ ev ] ) are precisely @xmath69 and we let @xmath70 , @xmath71 .    we calculate the spencer cohomology of @xmath16 ( [ ev ] ) by constructing resolutions to the symbols of the ricci operator .",

    "some classical cases , such as dirac - weyl equations , and many modern specifications are not touched , though can be treated via the same technique .",
    "some other cases are more delicate .    for instance",
    "the scalar minimally coupled matter field equations with the action ( here @xmath174 is a function and @xmath276 the volume form ) @xmath277=\\int_m[r-|d\\phi|_g^2-m^2\\phi^2]\\,dv_g\\ ] ] have block - form symbol operator @xmath278 ( with @xmath279 ; @xmath280=\\square\\phi - m^2\\phi$ ] ) , and so are involutive by theorem [ gen ] .",
    "non - minimally coupled field equations with the action @xmath277=\\int_m[f(\\phi)r-|d\\phi|_g^2-m^2\\phi^2]\\,dv_g\\ ] ] have the general symbol operator , and our methods do not apply directly .",
    "however the system can be re - written with triangular symbol , and then methods of section [ s5 ] show it is involutive , in particular for the important case @xmath281 . ] .",
    "let us deduce several corollaries of the involutivity .",
    "they are based on the cartan - khler theorem claiming that a formally integrable analytic system has local solutions . since involutivity implies formal integrability , we conclude    let @xmath282 be a jet of metric ( @xmath283 ) , which satisfies @xmath284-jet of the vacuum einstein equations ( [ e])@xmath91",

    "let @xmath289 be @xmath5-jets of a metric and an analytic 2-form , which are related by ( jets of ) source - free einstein - maxwell equation ( [ em1])@xmath162 .",
    "then there exists a local analytic solution @xmath290 of this equation with the prescribed jet @xmath291 .",
    "in particular , if a metric @xmath287 , a riemann tensor @xmath286 and a 2-form @xmath292 at the point @xmath285 are given , which satisfy the algebraic compatibility conditions through the first equation of ( [ em1 ] ) , then there exists an analytic solution to the source - free einstein - maxwell equations with the given initial data @xmath293 .",

    "here we collect some tedious verifications .",
    "let us begin by checking the fact that conservation law for ( [ e ] ) with fixed @xmath42 vanishes only for the vacuum case .",

    "is fixed ( @xmath38-independent ) , this implies @xmath303 and @xmath55 .",
    "formula ( [ div ] ) implies that the following sequences are complexes : @xmath307 since the previous discussion implies that the only possible cohomology can be supported at the term @xmath308 , the exactness can be verified by dimensional reasons as in @xcite .      the space @xmath310 is generated by vectors @xmath311 and @xmath312 with @xmath313 . for @xmath216 the operator @xmath314 is invertible : @xmath315 .",
    "thus @xmath316 we need to show that the generating elements belong to @xmath317 .",
    "this follows from exact formulae @xmath318 @xmath319 where @xmath320 are mutually orthogonal elements ( with non - zero length ; since both kernel and image are closed spaces this does not restrict generality ) , and @xmath321 for @xmath322 .",
    "consider a vector bundle @xmath19 over @xmath21 with fiber  vector space @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath323 be a determined differential operator of order @xmath5",

    "one of the proofs is the diagram chase by the bi - complex with vertical complex being ( @xmath326 denotes the symbolic system corresponding to @xmath16 ) @xmath327 and the horizontal one being the spencer complex generated by the first column .",
    "another possibility is to view this as a direct corollary of theorem a of , which concerns reductions of cohen - macaulay systems ( ideal of the determined equations is clearly cohen - macaulay ) .",
    "this theorem states that for a subspace @xmath328 transversal to the characteristic variety @xmath329 ( both complexified ) the reduced symbolic system @xmath330 has the same spencer cohomology as the symbolic system @xmath38 .",
