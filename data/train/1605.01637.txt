    "however , as far as we are aware , the non - bipartite triangular lattice model with the frustration and/or competition inducing magnetic and nematic interactions of mixed signs has not been studied yet .",
    "notwithstanding , the results obtained for a three - dimensional layered - triangular lattice xy model with different types of intra- and inter - layer magnetic and nematic interactions , reported in a series of papers  @xcite , suggest the presence of some non - trivial complex ground states resulting from the intra - layer geometrical frustration and competition between the magnetic and nematic couplings .    a recent study of the model with @xmath2 and positive both the magnetic and the generalized nematic interactions by poderoso et al .",
    "@xcite has revealed that the increasing value of @xmath0 can drastically change the phase diagram topology , featuring different phases belonging to a variety of universality classes .",
    "this finding is rather surprising , as it points to a significant lack of universality in the systems showing the same @xmath11 symmetry and thus raises a more general question about the credibility of the conclusions regarding the thermodynamic behavior of the system drawn from a coarse - grained hamiltonian . besides this intriguing theoretical aspect",

    "it is interesting that this frustrated spin model , studied theoretically over decades basically as an unrealizable toy model in the field of magnetism , found its first experimental realizations as a structural analogue of the systems in seemingly completely unrelated fields .    motivated by the above raised theoretical questions as well as further possible experimental realizations , in the present study we investigate ground - state and near - ground - state properties of the generalized xy model in a wide space of the parameters and discuss its application to the prediction of structural phases of a class of bimetalic cyanides based on an appropriate mapping between the two systems .",

    "[ fig : sym_quad ] . similar claim can be made also for the case with the purely generalized antinematic ( @xmath49 ) interactions if one restricts the considerations to the separate sublattices .",

    "thus , the resulting number of possible spin angles in the case of the purely generalized antinematic interactions is equal to @xmath67 , not taking into account the rotational symmetry .",
    "consequently , the relative turn angles between the neighboring spins from different sublattices can be defined as @xmath68 .",

    "however , we note that the finite temperature calculations pointed to the change of the phase diagram topology , giving different kinds of fm ordering for @xmath81 and for @xmath82  @xcite .",

    "note that as long as the ferromagnetic interactions are non - zero , the allowed phase angles @xmath86 are reduced to those with the smallest absolute values , thus enabling the best possible collinear alignment between the nearest neighbors , while the remaining possible generalized nematic states are suppressed .",
    "this phase is characterized by finite but unsaturated values of the order parameters , except for @xmath35 and @xmath72 that saturate in the limiting value of @xmath90 ( fig .",

    "the corresponding snapshots in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : snaps ] indicate a certain degree of fm ordering that , however , does not spread over the entire lattice but is rather contained within smaller domains .",
    "nevertheless , with the increasing @xmath0 the domain sizes tend to increase , which is also reflected in the increasing values of the magnetic order parameter @xmath34 .",
    "this can be explain in terms of a gradual relaxation of the frustration between the conflicting interactions @xmath23 due to the increase of the degrees of freedom of the generalized nematic order .",
    "therefore , in the limit of @xmath91 the phase angle @xmath92 and one can expect a full recovery of the standard fm quasi - lro .",
    "the increasing ferromagnetic correlations with the increasing @xmath0 are also evident from the behavior of the spin correlation function , presented in fig .",
    "[ cf1_7pi_4 ] .",
    "one can also notice that the presence of the generalized nematic term with @xmath79 decreases the correlation at the lags corresponding to distances between different sublattices ( empty symbols ) , such as at the lags @xmath93 and @xmath94 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt ] . nevertheless , the nature of the correlations remains algebraic , as for the standard xy ferromagnet , albeit , with increased values of the exponent @xmath95 .",

    "however , for @xmath99 the picture changes drastically .",
    "the chiral afm order disappears and the neighboring spins align forming turn angles with @xmath74-dependent values @xmath86 .",
    "this is similar to the phase iv but since @xmath6 is now afm the preferred phase angles are those with the smallest and the largest absolute values .",
    "thus , the correlation between spins belonging to the same ( different ) sublattices is positive ( negative ) ( fig .",
    "[ cf1_5pi_4 ] ) . like in the phase iv , the sublattice correlation function follows the power law with @xmath95 larger than for the standard xy antiferromagnet , but decreasing with @xmath0 .",
    "however , this is only true in the instances when the turn angles between different sublattices , preferred by the generalized nematic interactions for a given @xmath0 , do not include the chiral afm phase angles @xmath98 , as it is for @xmath99 or @xmath100 . in all the other instances , like for @xmath101",
    ", there is no conflict between the magnetic and generalized nematic interactions and the systems show the chiral afm ordering ( see the central column in fig .",
    "[ fig : snaps ] ) .",
    "finally , similar arguments can be made in order to explain ordering in the phase corresponding to @xmath102 $ ] but the dependence on @xmath0 is somehow reversed .",
    "namely , the chiral afm order is preserved for any @xmath0 divisible by 3 , like for @xmath103 in our results , in which cases the spin alignments dictated by the magnetic and generalized nematic interactions are not antagonistic ( see the left column in fig .",

    "cairns et al . have shown  @xcite that the structure of such a complex bimetallic compound can be modeled by the ground states of a bilinear - biquadratic xy model  @xcite , which is just a special case of the present generalized xy model with @xmath1 .",
