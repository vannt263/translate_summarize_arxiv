    "understanding the elastic and relaxation properties of crosslinked networks and rubber has been a longstanding problem @xcite .",
    "one of the main unresolved issues has been the importance of trapped entanglements in determining the properties of the network .",
    "edwards @xcite first introduced the idea that obstacles produced by other chains give rise to a tube in which the monomers of a chain move . later de gennes generalized these same ideas to long chains , resulting in the reptation model for the dynamics of an entangled polymer melt @xcite .",
    "however how entanglements affect the properties of a crosslinked network remains controversial .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "the first is that most experiments do not allow good control of all the microscopic parameters .",
    "second , theoretical descriptions are very complicated due to the presence of quenched disorder and usually contain several adjustable parameters , which are difficult to relate to microscopic details and are almost impossible to determine uniquely from experiment .",
    "computer simulations can directly address many fundamental questions regarding the dynamics of polymer networks .",
    "details of the microscopic topology , such as the elastically active fraction of the network and loop entanglements , can be identified and controlled . in particular , it is possible to isolate and quantify their effects on macroscopic observables such as the elastic modulus .",
    "simulation results on randomly crosslinked , end - linked @xcite and diamond networks @xcite have conclusively demonstrated the importance of trapped entanglements in determining the elastic and relaxational properties of the network .",
    "results for the mean square displacement of the crosslinks show that they do not move completely freely in space as assumed in the phantom network model but instead are confined to region of space of the order of the tube diameter of an uncrosslinked polymer melt @xcite .",
    "further the monomers of strands of length @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the entanglement length of the melt , are also confined to a tube .",
    "the fluctuations of the middle monomers are found to diverge very slowly @xcite , as @xmath3 in accordance with reptation theory .    to test the theoretical models , it is advantageous to study model networks , preferably with equal strand lengths between crosslinks and no dangling ends .",
    "as such , we have carried out elongation simulations on ideal diamond lattice networks @xcite and end - linked networks @xcite . in the former ,",
    "the network is constructed to have the coordination of a diamond lattice , with a well controlled topology . a second class of networks , which is not quite as ideal but experimentally realizable is end - linked networks @xcite .",
    "in this case one starts with a melt of linear chains and adds @xmath4-functional crosslinkers to a fraction of the chain ends .",
    "then by changing the temperature or other conditions , these groups can be activated , so that when another end comes in contact a chemical reaction can occur .",
    "we have made a number of model networks following this procedure @xcite . a third class which is of high practical importance",
    "are randomly crosslinked networks , where crosslinks between melt chains are introduced between any pair of monomers .",
    "we have also made model systems of this type , with the difference that we attached the end - monomers to a randomly chosen nearby monomer resulting in a tri - functional networks instead of the usual four - functional ones .",
    "the benefit of this method is that the networks contain no dangling ends which slow down relaxation and are not believed to contribute to zero - frequency stress .",
    "here we present new results for the non - linear stress strain properties of end - linked networks as well as some results on swelling of randomly crosslinked networks .",
    "to simulate the networks we use the molecular dynamics method which has been successfully applied to study entanglement effects in polymer melts @xcite . in this model",
    "the polymers are represented as freely jointed bead - spring chains .",
    "all monomeric units of mass @xmath5 interact via a purely repulsive lennard - jones potential @xmath6          & $ r \\le r_c$;\\cr          0          & $ r > r_c$ , \\cr } \\label{lj}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 .",
    "monomer units connected along the chain or through the crosslinking procedure are connected by a finite extensible non - linear elastic ( fene ) potential .",
    "the model parameter are the same as in ref .",
    "the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "we use dimensionless units in which @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the basic unit of time @xmath11 .",
    "the simulations are carried out at a constant density @xmath12 .",
    "one of the most important features of this model is that the energy barrier for the crossing of two chain segments is high enough ( @xmath13 ) such that crossing is virtually impossible .    in our previous studies of the mean",
    "squared displacement of the chains in a dense melt , we found that the entanglement length @xmath2 for this model is approximately 35 beads @xcite .",
    "this result is obtained by comparing the crossover time @xmath14 at which the motion of the monomers in the chain slows down from its initial rouse - like motion at early times to the slower @xmath15 behavior predicted by reptation theory .",
    "this result was confirmed by come recent simulations @xcite on very long chains ( @xmath16,@xmath17 and @xmath18 ) which also found that the segment motion of the chains was in very good agreement with the reptation model .",
    "estimates from these simulations suggest @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however calculations of the plateau modulus @xmath20 , which were not carried out in our earlier studies due to lack of computer time , indicate that @xmath2 is much larger .",
    "this estimate of @xmath21 was obtained using the standard formula of doi @xcite @xmath22 depending on the formula we use to fit the non - linear stress strain data , we obtain values for @xmath21 between @xmath23 to @xmath24 , about twice as large as that obtained from the displacement of the chains .",
    "we use the average value @xmath25 when comparing our results to experiment .",
    "this suggests an error in the pre - factor @xmath26 in eq .",
    "experimentally @xmath2 is only determined from @xmath20 .",
    "we also find that diffusion constant data from the simulations and from experiment agree very well when both are scaled by their rouse value for short chains and plotted versus @xmath27 @xcite .    here",
    "we present results for end - linked systems @xmath28 consisting of @xmath29 chains of length @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . due to the slow relaxation and long simulation runs required to obtain the stress at a given strain , the results presented here are for one configuration for @xmath34 and @xmath35 and two configurations for @xmath16 .",
    "for comparison we also present results for the plateau modulus for @xmath16 and @xmath36 @xcite . for details of the end crosslinking procedure , see ref .",
    "for the swelling studies , we present results for randomly crosslinked systems ( @xmath37 ) of size @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath30 is the melt precursor chain length before crosslinking and @xmath40 is the average length of a network strands between crosslinks .",
    "we will restrict our analysis to the effect of ( partial ) swelling in good solvent on the stress - strain relationship of these networks .",
    "the elastic modulus and non - linear stress versus strain are easily measured experimentally for networks .",
    "numerically the shear modulus can be obtained from uniaxial , volume conserving elongation of the sample which can be described by a diagonal deformation tensor @xmath41 with the stretching factor @xmath42 and the contraction factors @xmath43 in the other two directions .",
    "the normal stress @xmath44 is then readily determined from the microscopic virial tensor , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the direction of elongation . in the present simulations we vary @xmath47 from @xmath48 ( extension ) to @xmath49 ( compression ) . due to finite system size",
    ", we are limited to relatively large strains @xmath50 or @xmath51 . for smaller strains ,",
    "the stress is small and difficult to determine from the noise .",
    "after an initial step strain , the strain decays very slowly . for the longest chain lengths studied ( @xmath52 , runs typically of at least @xmath53 ( @xmath54 for shorter network strands )",
    "were needed to reach equilibrium .",
    "the classical theory of rubber elasticity @xcite is based on the empirical fact that the network strands have gaussian coil statistics . with the exterior deformation described by the tensor @xmath41",
    "the resulting free energy stored in the network strands ( of entirely entropic origin ) is : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the volume of the sample , @xmath57 the number density of elastically active strands , @xmath4 their functionality and @xmath58 are the diagonal elements of the deformation tensor .",
    "the above result was derived by james and guth @xcite under the assumptions that the crosslinks and the connecting strands are allowed to fluctuate freely without mutual hindrance of each other ( this is commonly referred to as the phantom chain model ) . if one fixes the crosslinks in space so that they deform affinely under strain ( the affine model ) the factor @xmath59 disappears and on arrives at the old result given by kuhn @xcite . with this on",
    "can readily derive an expression for the normal tension in the sample as function of the elongation @xcite , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the transversal cross section of the sample .",
    "flory and erman @xcite extended the theory to allow entanglement effects on the crosslinks by reducing their fluctuation radii , thus interpolating between the affine and the phantom model with a more complicated stress strain behavior .",
    "the model is quite successful describing many experimental stress - strain relations as well as our data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stressstrain]a ) .",
    "however , due to our additional knowledge on the conformations of the chain @xcite , we know that the fluctuations of the entire chains are restricted and therefore we think that constraint models for junctions alone should be discarded .",
    "many models exist which limit the fluctuations of the network strands like the tube - model by heinrich _",
    "@xcite or some recent constraint models by kloczkowski _",
    "@xcite , rubinstein and panyukov ( rp ) @xcite and everaers @xcite . of these",
    ", especially the rp model is rather appealing , since it introduces only one additional parameter , the chain length between entanglements @xmath2 .",
    "erman s and everaers recent models introduce a large set of constraint parameters and little is known yet how to choose them , although the physical meaning of these parameters is relatively clear .",
    "at least for everaers model it has been demonstrated how to obtain more detailed knowledge about network fluctuations by measuring these parameters directly through simulations of highly idealized networks with diamond lattice topology @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have presented molecular dynamics simulation results for the non - linear stress strain properties of a crosslinked polymer network . because the topology of the network can be readily controlled in the simulations , computer simulations provide a powerful way to test various theoretical models .",
    "combined with our earlier studies , we are now beginning to obtain a better microscopic understanding of how the topology of the network controls the dynamics and relaxation of the chain segments and the crosslinks .",
    "all of our data strongly support constraint models in which the monomers are constrained to move in a tube formed by the neighboring chains .",
    "the crosslinking process traps in the dynamic entanglements present in the uncrosslinked melt .",
    "these trapped entanglements dominate the stress relaxation and modulus when the strand length between crosslinks is large . in the unswollen , dry state , the chains are gaussian in agreement with all models .",
    "however as the system is swollen in a good solvent , they become strongly non - gaussian on length scales less than the distance between crosslinks . in the dry state",
    ", a number of model for the stress - strain relation can be used to describe the data , although further work is necessary to arrive at a more quantitative understanding physical of the resulting fitting parameters .",
    "clearly a more microscopic approach investigating network fluctuations is necessary to distinguish between these models . in the swollen state",
    "we find that short stranded networks eventually recover the phantom result for the modulus , however finite chain length corrections and a proper account for the non - gaussian statistics are clearly needed to descibe their entire ( @xmath62 ) stress - strain relations . in long strand networks",
    "the entanglement contribution to the modulus decreases with swelling but compared to the predictions of the phantom and affine models a significant contribution remains .",
    "the stress strain curves at high swelling are better described by classical ( crosslinks only ) theories , hence the remaining effect of entanglements appears more like an additional crosslink contribution .",

    "a mode analysis was used to determine the modulus @xmath20 .",
    "however the formulation used was incorrect . though the qualatitative features of the modulus with strand length @xmath63 were correct , the results were not quantatitive .",
    "in particular the factor @xmath64 relating @xmath65 to that determined from the mode analysis was incorrect . this will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "note , that most experimentalists define the normal stress as the force per unstretched crosssection , thus the extra factor of @xmath47 disappears . in simulations we use the given definition since that corresponds to the definition from the microscopic virial tensor ."
