    "there is a technological need to develop faster , smaller , cheaper and more reliable memory devices , which is therefore promoting the search to improve their capacity to retain a higher density of information , at lower costs , using less energy and operating under hostile environment conditions .",
    "@xcite as possible candidates to fulfil such an overwhelming task , we can find memories ( rram ) based on the resistive switching ( rs ) mechanism , where the non - volatile and reversible resistance state of a metal - oxide interface is varied upon the application of electric pulses .",
    "@xcite in the past few years some remarkable improvements have been made to understand the physics behind the memory properties of rram devices .",
    "@xcite as an example , the underlying memory mechanism of devices based on metal - perovskite oxide junctions was associated with the resistance change due to oxygen - vacancy electromigration near the interface .",
    "@xcite despite these advances , many aspects are still unclear and should be addressed in order to improve their practical capabilities . in that sense ,",
    "one important feature to determine in each particular device is the conduction mechanism that dominates its electrical transport properties .",
    "this knowledge can be the key to control most of the desired properties of a memory device as it points out which are the relevant microscopic factors that determine their resistive state .",
    "depending on material characteristics of the metal - oxide interface , the mechanism can be electrode - limited or bulk - limited .",
    "@xcite in the electrode - limited ones , the work function of the metal , the carrier affinity and the thickness of the oxide determine the barrier height and the probability to produce an electric - field - induced - current through the junction . in this case",
    ", the mechanism can be described as schottky , fowler - nordheim or direct tunneling emission . in the bulk - limited case ,",
    "the conduction mechanism is determined by the electrical properties of the oxide near the interface , particularly by the existence of traps and their energy levels .",
    "poole - frenkel emission ( p - f ) and space - charge - limited conduction ( sclc ) are two examples of transport mechanisms influenced by the energy distribution and density of traps .",
    "metal - yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) interfaces on ceramic and thin - films samples have both shown bipolar rs characteristics .",
    "@xcite their retentivity  @xcite as well as their response to cyclic electric field stresses  @xcite have been previously studied .",
    "although the microscopic origin of its rs properties was successfully associated to the electromigration of oxygen vacancies  @xcite , no detailed studies of the conduction mechanism through the interface have been already performed .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to identify the relevant transport mechanism of au / yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) interfaces , in order to point out the microscopic factors that determine the resistive state , as the temperature dependence and magnitude of the resistance change upon producing a rs .",
    "our results indicate that a p - f emission mechanism dominates the current - voltage dependence of the junction , consequently indicating the existence of carrier traps and of a low conductivity region in the interfacial ybco . within this scenario ,",
    "most probably related to a random distribution of oxygen vacancies near the junction , we present a description of the electrical conduction based on a modified variable - range hopping ( vrh ) mechanism .",
    "the modification that we propose is based on considering that the available electrical carriers are only those thermally or voltage assisted de - trapped which obey to a p - f law . in this framework , we show that increasing the amplitude or the number of applied pulses has qualitatively the same microscopic effect on modifying the trap energy level as well as the resistivity and the geometric factor of a conducting channel .",

    "thus , we may disregard the influence of the pt / ybco electrode and proceed as if only the au / ybco electrode were active ( i.e. presents a relevant rs effect ) , simplifying the effects produced upon voltage pulsing treatments .    in order to analyze the sensitivity of the microscopic parameters that control the electrical transport properties of the au / ybco interface to the voltage amplitude and to the number of applied pulses , we applied the following pulsing protocol ( see fig .",
