    "collisionless magnetic reconnection drives explosive events in space plasma environments . on the large scale",
    ", reconnection is an mhd - scale process but is facilitated by a compact `` diffusion region '' surrounding the reconnection point , where kinetic physics plays a role . in the hall reconnection",
    "model,@xcite it is thought that the electron diffusion region ( edr ) , where the electrons decouple from field lines , is embedded in the ion s diffusion region @xcite .",
    "the edr is related to a localized dissipation region that allows fast reconnection , and it also adjusts the overall system evolution to the outer ion physics.@xcite owing to its importance in reconnection , the edr is one of the most important targets of nasa s upcoming magnetospheric multiscale ( mms ) mission ( http://mms.space.swri.edu/ ) , which will be the first to probe the electron - scale physics .",
    "the hall reconnection model has been recently challenged by kinetic particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations that sufficiently resolve electron - scale structures@xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the edr is no longer localized but it unexpectedly stretches in the outflow directions@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it appears to embody a two - scale structure of inner and outer regions @xcite .",
    "minor differences aside , the inner region is a compact region containing the reconnection site .",
    "it features a strong out - of - plane electron current and a dissipative electric field @xmath0 to transport the magnetic fields .",
    "the outer region extends in the outflow direction , accompanied by a fast electron jet , often denoted as the `` super - alfvnic '' jet . since the jet outruns the moving magnetic field@xcite",
    ", the out - of - plane component of @xmath1 has the opposite polarity from that in the inner region .",
    "satellite observations corroborate these structures in near - earth reconnection sites@xcite .",
    "the role of the edr is a subject of recent debate . in principle",
    ", many works have agreed that the reconnection rate is controlled by the inner region or the inner region adjusts its size to the global reconnection rate @xcite .",
    "its long - term , time - dependent behavior remains unclear .",
    "@xcite argued that the ( inner ) edr stretches in the outflow direction .",
    "they further proposed an idea that the secondary island formation maintains fast reconnection by cutting and shortening the elongated edr .",
    "in contrast , @xcite demonstrated that the inner region remains at the finite length and that the reconnection is fast , quasi - steady , and laminar . regarding the outer region",
    ", it does not appear to constrain the reconnection rate @xcite , because reconnection remains fast while the electron jet extends a large distance .",
    "@xcite found that the electron flow essentially consists of the @xmath2 convection and the diamagnetic current for the field reversal .",
    "thus , even though it is frequently mentioned by the outer edr @xcite , it is not clear whether the outer region is dissipative .",
    "furthermore , it is not well understood how the electron jet is terminated .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a new measure to identify the dissipation region of reconnection . considering the energy dissipation in the rest frame of electron s bulk motion",
    ", they introduced the _ electron - frame dissipation measure _ , @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4^{-1/2}$ ] is the lorentz factor for the electron velocity and @xmath5 is the charge density .",
    "this measure is a lorentz - invariant , and it is related to the nonideal energy conversion , which is essential for reconnection problems .",
    "their pic simulations demonstrated that @xmath6 identifies a single dissipation region surrounding the reconnection site .",
    "this is substantially different from the previous two - scale picture .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to organize our knowledge on the dissipation region in collisionless magnetic reconnection in line of recent theoretical progress @xcite . using high - resolution two - dimensional pic simulations",
    ", we perform a detailed investigation of internal structures in basic antiparallel configurations .",
    "in particular , the previous two - scale edr are reexamined by using the electron - frame dissipation measure @xmath6 .",

    "we also find that the electron temperature and pressure increase across the transition region .",
    "these signatures indicate that it is a shock between the upstream fast electron jet and the downstream magnetized electron flow .",
    "the discontinuity separates an unmagnetized upstream flow and the magnetized downstream flow .",
    "ions are insensitive to the shock .",
    "they are not magnetized on both sides , and the length of the transition region is only one @xmath142 , which is smaller than the ion inertial length based on the local density . in order to distinguish this from full mhd shocks , we hereafter refer to it as an `` electron shock . ''",
    "as time goes on , the electron shock moves outward .",
    "it reaches at @xmath143 at @xmath144 .",
    "after that , the shock propagates backward .",
    "this is the influence of our periodic boundary condition . after a sufficiently long time",

    "[ fig : eshock](b ) ] , due to a reverse electron current @xmath148 . unlike the dissipation region",

    "[ fig : eshock](c ) ] . in the shock - downstream of @xmath150 , @xmath49 suddenly becomes weaker than in the upstream .",
    "the vertical magnetic pressure @xmath151 exhibit similar profiles .",
    "this is identical to the magnetic cavity ( figure [ fig:3d ] ) .",
    "note that the vertical component ( @xmath134 ) is compressed across the shock .",
    "we calculate the electron temperature [ fig .",
    "[ fig : eshock](d ) ] by tracing the diagonal components of the pressure tensor , @xmath152 each component basically shows a similar profile .",
    "one can see that the temperature quickly increases across the shock , due to the fast jet speed .",
    "the energy transfer from the electromagnetic fields to electrons , @xmath137 , is presented in figure [ fig : eshock](e ) .",
    "it is negative @xmath153 around the transition region .",
    "the same signature of @xmath153 was reported by a previous work ( the `` electron dynamo region '' in ref .  ) .",
    "these results tell us that the bulk kinetic energy of the electron jet is transferred to the electron heat [ fig .",
    "[ fig : eshock](d ) ] and the magnetic energy [ fig .",
    "[ fig : eshock](e ) ] in the shock downstream . here",
    ", the magnetic energy is stored in the compressed reconnected field @xmath134 , because both @xmath126 and @xmath49 are very weak near the neutral line @xmath57 .",
    "the strong electron heating also explains the magnetic cavity structure .",
    "although the electron pressure substantially increases across the shock , the surrounding tangential fields @xmath154 are not strong enough to confine electrons in the @xmath26-direction in the downstream .",
    "the high - pressure electrons expand the structure outwards along @xmath134 in the @xmath155 directions .",
    "the displacement of the tangential fields lead to the magnetic cavity .",
    "starting with a work by @xcite , the structures of the electron diffusion region has been actively discussed for the past five years .",
    "earlier investigations focused on the violation of the ideal frozen - in condition , @xmath156 .",
    "this lead to the popular two - scale picture@xcite , in which the role of the edrs was not clearly understood . in this work ,",
    "we have explored and reorganized our understanding of fine reconnection structures in line of ref .  .",
    "we have confirmed that the electron - frame dissipation measure characterizes the critical region at higher mass ratio of @xmath27 .",
    "since the size of the dissipation region becomes smaller at higher mass ratio , it seems that the electron physics is responsible for the dissipation region .",
    "the relevance to the mass ratio further needs to be investigated in order to extrapolate our results to a realistic ratio of 1836 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : outflow ] , we found that no dissipation takes place in the electron jet region , @xmath123 .",
    "consequently , we do nt think it is appropriate to call it the outer electron `` diffusion '' region or the outer electron `` dissipation '' region . as reconnection proceeds ,",
    "the nondissipative electron jets are elongated , while the central dissipation region remains compact .",
    "this is consistent with the recent consensus that reconnection remains fast @xcite .    from the observational viewpoint , the contribution from the charge term in eq .",
    "[ eq : edr2 ] is of strong interest , because the charge density @xmath5 will be difficult to probe . in run 1a , the charge term is an order - of - magnitude smaller than @xmath6 , and it is only localized near the dissipation region [ fig . [ fig:35](f ) ] . in run 1b with @xmath94",
    ", the charge separation appears nonnegligible .",
    "let us estimate the charge separation around the dissipation region .",
    "we assume that the local plasma density @xmath157 is roughly uniform .",
    "electrons are magnetized to the field lines outside the electron current layer , and the electron out - of - plane speed is on an order of the electron alfvn speed @xmath158 .",
    "the hall electric field @xmath58 is approximated by @xmath159 gauss s law in the @xmath26 direction tells us the charge density in the center , @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the typical thickness of the dissipation region . using the result in sec .",
    "[ sec : dr ] , we assume @xmath162 where the index @xmath163 is between @xmath164 . substituting this to eq .",
    "[ eq : gauss ] , we obtain @xmath165 we see that the charge separation is controlled by the @xmath34 parameter and that it is much less sensitive to the mass ratio .    in the magnetotail ,",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath166 nt in the lobe ( upstream region ) .",
    "the corresponding electron gyro frequency is @xmath167 hz . the plasma sheet density @xmath168 gives @xmath169 khz .",
    "thus we obtain a typical value of @xmath170 .",
    "in addition , since the upstream plasma occupies the reconnection region , it is useful to compare the upstream conditions .",
    "while our numerical model assumes that the background density is @xmath171 , the lobe density is substantially lower , @xmath172 . in the case of @xmath173 , since an upstream plasma frequency is modified by a factor of @xmath174 , our model with @xmath175 will be relevant .",
    "these estimates suggest that the charge separation effects will be marginally negligible in the magnetotail .",
    "this needs to be verified by further numerical investigations with realistic lobe densities@xcite .",
    "we have found that the fast electron jet terminates at the shock , where the electrons become magnetized .",
    "the magnetic cavity structure can be understood as its consequence .",
    "we expect that shock - like signatures are more prominent at higher mass ratio , because the electron jet speed @xmath176 is much faster than the typical outflow speed @xmath177 . in a larger system or an open - boundary system@xcite",
    ", we expect that the electron shock travels further downstream , unless ( 1 ) an obstacle in the downstream such as a secondary island , ( 2 ) instabilities of the jet , and ( 3 ) 3d effects interrupt the shock propagation .",
    "the electron shock may play a role on particle acceleration as well .",
    "for example , @xcite discussed a two - step scenario of electron acceleration : pre - acceleration near the reconnection site and energetization by @xmath178*b*/curvature drifts near the flux the flux pile - up region .",
    "our results suggest that a significant shock - heating ( and possibly shock - drift type acceleration ) takes place between the two acceleration sites .",
    "the electron shock deserves further investigation in the context of particle acceleration .",
    "we summarize our understanding in figure [ fig : summary ] . as well known , a hall reconnection features the quadrupole out - of - plane magnetic field @xmath49 , which is generated by the hall current circuit @xcite .",
    "there is a narrow channel of @xmath71 near the neutral plane @xcite .",
    "we call this channel the electron current layer , because the electric current @xmath56 is distinctly stronger than in the other regions .",
    "this current layer is beyond the scope of the fluid theory . inside the electron current layer",
    ", there is a single dissipation region surrounding the reconnection point @xcite .",
    "this region is thinner and longer than the conventional inner region .",
    "the fast , narrow electron jet @xcite travels from the dissipation region .",
    "this is a projection of the diamagnetic current@xcite and a part of the hall current circuit@xcite . as discussed in section [ sec : outflow ] , this region is not dissipative .",
    "there is a pedestal region@xcite outside the electron jet .",
    "the electron jet is terminated by an electron shock and the magnetic cavity develops there .",
    "the upcoming mms mission will measure the field and plasma properties at high resolutions in near - earth reconnection sites . due to the limited bandwidth between the satellite and the earth",
    ", it is very important to select the data in high - priority regions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the electron - frame dissipation measure is a good marker of the most important dissipation region .",
    "we have further updated our understanding on fine structures surrounding the dissipation region .",
