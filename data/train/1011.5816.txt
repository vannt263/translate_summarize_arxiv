    "over the decades , two  photon bound  bound transitions in atoms and ions have provided a unique testing ground for advanced atomic theories . starting from the early work by gppert ",
    "mayer @xcite and breit and teller @xcite , a large number of theoretical studies were carried out to estimate the total as well as the energy and angle  differential ( two  photon ) decay rates @xcite .",
    "when compared with experimental data @xcite , these studies revealed important information on relativistic , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and many  body phenomena in atomic systems . besides structure  related investigations , more recent interest focuses on the _ quantum correlations _ between the emitted photons , which can be used to probe fundamental aspects of modern quantum theory . in a series of studies , for example ,",
    "polarization correlations _ were employed to test the bell inequality @xcite .",
    "in particular , these investigations demonstrated that the polarization correlations can not be explained by any local realistic theory that uses hidden variables .",
    "hence , together with other bell test experiments , two  photon studies proved that nature indeed does exhibit quantum  mechanical non  locality .",
    "these results contributed to the long - lasting historical debate of einstein with bohr and schrdinger @xcite who introduced the notion of entanglement for denoting nonproduct ( pure ) states .    in the past",
    ", both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of @xmath5 polarization correlation were mainly restricted to the @xmath6 decay of neutral hydrogen ( or deuterium ) .",
    "much less attention was paid to two  photon transitions in other atomic or ionic species . with the recent advances in heavy  ion accelerator and trap facilities as well as in x  ray detection techniques , new possibilities arise to study spin  correlation phenomena in the decay of heavy , few ",
    "electron ions . in the medium and high@xmath0 domain",
    ", however , a proper analysis of polarization quantum correlations requires detailed knowledge of relativistic and of many  electron effects , as well as of those contributions that arise from the higher - order ( non  dipole ) terms in the expansion of the electron  photon interaction .    in this contribution , we investigate quantum correlations between the polarization states of two photons emitted in the decay of few  electron ions .",
    "most naturally , spin  correlation phenomena are described within the framework of density matrix theory .",
    "however , before we present details from this theory , we first summarize the geometry under which the two  photon decay is considered in section [ sec_labeling ] . in section [ sub_sec_dm ] , then , the general expression for the spin  density matrix of the photon pair is derived , in terms of the initial populations of the ionic substates , and of the ( second  order ) transition amplitudes .",
    "the evaluation of these amplitudes in relativistic , second  order perturbation theory is thereafter discussed for hydrogen and helium  like ions . for the latter species , we make use of the independent particle model ( ipm ) which is appropriate for the analysis of bound  state transitions in the high@xmath0 domain @xcite . apart from rigorous relativistic results , we also present simplified expressions describing the photons polarization state within the dipole approximation .",
    "these intuitive expressions , derived in section [ sub_sec_nrapprox ] , will enable us to understand the general behaviour of polarization correlations . in order to provide a quantitative description for these correlations , we briefly recall in section [ sec_concurrence ] the definition of _ concurrence _ as measure of entanglement .",
    "fully relativistic calculations of the concurrence are then performed for the @xmath7 transition in hydrogen  like , as well as @xmath8 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 transitions in helium  like ions .",
    "results of these calculations are displayed in section [ sec_results ] , and are compared to the predictions based on the dipole approximation . from this comparison",
    "we infer the twofold impact of relativity on polarization entanglement : apart from ( i ) the loss of purity of the photon states , ( ii ) the relativistic contraction of the wavefunctions and the non  dipole contributions to the electron ",
    "photon interaction generally lead to the reduction of concurrence ; an effect that becomes prominent for heavy ions and high photon energies . a brief summary , together with some perspectives , is given in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "atomics units are used throughout the paper , unless differently stated .",
    "in order to analyze @xmath10 polarization correlations , we first introduce the geometry of the two  photon emission . since , for the decay of unpolarized ions , there is no direction _ initially preferred _ for the overall system",
    ", we adopt the momentum of the `` first '' photon to coincide with the @xmath11 axis which is also taken to be the quantization axis .",
    "together with the direction of the `` second '' photon , this axis defines the reaction plane ( x  z plane ) . a single _ opening _",
    "angle @xmath12 is required , therefore , to characterize the emission of the photons with respect to each other ( cf . fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) .    since the two photons are in a symmetrized state , it is _ a priori _ not possible to address them individually .",
    "however , we can safely assume that photons observed by the detectors have definite energies and momenta , i.e. they _ collapse _ onto energy and momentum eigenstates .",
    "a clear identity can be given , therefore , to the photons @xcite : the _ first ( second ) _ photon is that one detected by the detector @xmath13 ( marked gray in fig .  [ geometry ] ) at a certain energy @xmath14 and with momentum @xmath15 . by distinguishing in such a way the photons",
    ", we can use their _ polarization states _ in order to investigate the associated entanglement properties .",
    "indeed , such an analysis is possible since  in contrast to the energy and momentum spaces  the photon spin state can be directly measured in any basis .",
    "axis is oriented along the direction of the photon with momentum @xmath16 , measured by the detector a. together with the emission direction of the second photon , it defines the @xmath17 reaction plane .",
    "the opening angle between both photons is denoted by @xmath12 , while the ( linear ) polarization angles of the photons , measured with respect to the @xmath18@xmath11-plane , are denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . ]",
    "having defined the geometry of the two  photon decay , we shall next recall the theoretical background needed to investigate the polarization of the emitted radiation .",
    "most naturally , polarization ",
    "correlation studies can be performed in terms of the system s density matrix . since",
    "this approach was recently applied to describe two  photon transitions in hydrogen  like ions @xcite , here we may restrict ourselves to a short compilation of the basic formulas relevant for our further analysis .",
    "the initial state of the overall system , in our two  photon decay problem , is given by the photon vacuum @xmath21 , and by the excited ion ( or atom ) in states @xmath22 with well  defined total angular momentum @xmath23 and associated projection @xmath24 onto the @xmath11-axis .",
    "moreover , @xmath25 is a collective label for all additional quantum numbers required for a unique specification of the state . in particular , it characterizes electronic configurations that give rise to the state and , hence , provides its _ parity _ , @xmath26 .    the magnetic sublevel population of the ion in initial states is described as a statistical mixture , by the density operator @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the population of the magnetic substate @xmath29 . since in",
    "most ( two  photon ) experiments , the initially `` prepared '' excited ionic states are _ unpolarized _ , we fix the parameters as @xmath30 .",
    "such a realistic choice for the initial  state population has important consequences for the ( spin ) entanglement of emitted photon pairs .",
    "as we will see later , by introducing the _ incoherent _ mixture of initial magnetic substates ( [ initop ] ) , also the two - photon state s coherences are jeopardized and , hence , a loss of quantum correlations is induced .    the density ( statistical ) operators of the initial and the final states of the overall system are connected by the standard relation @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the evolution operator which accounts for the interaction of the ion with the radiation field . the final  state operator ( [ r ] ) describes both the de  excited ion in some state @xmath33 and the two emitted photons with momenta @xmath34 and helicities @xmath35 .",
    "owing to the transverse character of the electromagnetic radiation , these helicities , or projections of the photon momenta on their own directions of propagation , can take only two values @xmath36 .    instead of using the final  state density operator @xmath37",
    ", it is often more convenient to work with its matrix representation , briefly referred to as the final  state _ density matrix_. in the representation of the individual angular momenta this matrix reads : @xmath38 where we employed eq .",
    "( [ initop ] ) in order to evaluate elements of the ionic initial",
    " state matrix @xmath39 , and introduced _ formal _ notation for the transition amplitude : @xmath40 as seen from this expression , the @xmath41 describes a transition between two bound ionic states accompanied by the _ simultaneous _ emission of two photons .",
    "the final  state matrix ( [ dm_final_general ] ) still contains the _ complete _ information about the system and can be used to derive the properties of the photons or the residual ion . assuming that the final magnetic sub  state of the ion remains unobserved in an experiment",
    ", we can derive the _ reduced _ density matrix @xmath42 which only describes the polarization state of the two photons , measured at a certain opening angle @xmath12 , with certain energies @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath45     \\quad\\equiv{\\displaystyle}\\sum_{m_f}\\bra{f;\\vec k_1,\\lambda_1,\\vec k_2,\\lambda_2}\\hat\\rho_f     \\ket{f;\\vec k_1,\\lambda_1',\\vec k_2,\\lambda_2'}\\\\     \\quad = { \\displaystyle}\\frac{{\\mathcal n}}{2j_i + 1 } \\ ,",

    "in what follows we will use this ( reduced ) matrix in order to analyze the polarization entanglement of the photons pair . before starting such analysis",
    ", we shall briefly discuss the computation of the second  order amplitude ( [ matrix_element_general ] ) .",

    "because of energy conservation , @xmath52 and @xmath54 are related to the energies @xmath55 of the emitted photons by : @xmath56 from this relation , it is convenient to define the energy sharing parameter @xmath57 , i.e. the fraction of the energy which is carried away by the `` first '' photon .    in eq .",
    "( [ mfi ] ) @xmath58 is the transition operator that describes the relativistic interaction of the electrons with the electromagnetic radiation . in velocity ( coulomb )",

    "for practical computations , it is convenient to decompose the vector potential @xmath62 into spherical tensors ( i.e. , into its electric and magnetic multipole components ) . for the emission of the photon in the direction @xmath64 with respect to the quantization @xmath11 axis ,",
    "such a decomposition reads : @xmath65^{1/2 } \\ , ( i \\lambda)^p \\ , \\nonumber \\\\     & \\times & \\hat{a}^{p}_{l_\\gamma m_\\gamma}(k ) \\ , d^{l_\\gamma}_{m_\\gamma \\lambda}(\\hat k ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 = 2l_\\gamma + 1 $ ] , @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the wigner rotation matrix of rank @xmath69 and the @xmath70 refer to magnetic ( @xmath71 = 0 ) and electric ( @xmath71 = 1 ) multipoles , respectively .    the great advantage of the multipole expansion ( [ a_decomposition ] ) , when comparing to the plane  wave formulation in the right  hand  side of eq .",
    "( [ r_interaction ] ) , is that it provides a radial  angular representation of the photon wavefunction .",
    "together with the similar representations of the atomic wavefunctions it allows for significant simplification of the transition amplitude @xmath41 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ a_decomposition ] ) gives a very useful tool for studying the multipole effects in the electron ",
    "photon interaction .",
    "if , for example , the summation in ( [ a_decomposition ] ) is restricted to the term with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , one obtaines the electric ",
    "dipole ( e1 ) contribution , while the @xmath72 , @xmath74 component provides the magnetic  dipole ( m1 ) contribution , and so on .",
    "as seen from eq .",
    "( [ mfi ] ) , the evaluation of second  order transition amplitudes requires the summation over the _",
    "complete _ spectrum of the ion . within the relativistic framework ,",
    "such a computation is not a simple task since it includes a summation over the discrete part of the dirac spectrum as well as an integration over the positive and negative  energy continua .",
    "a number of methods have been developed over the past decades to compute eq .",
    "( [ mfi ] ) consistently .",
    "apart from a direct summation over just few intermediate states which are close in energy to the states involved in the decay , the discrete  basis  set approach is widely employed nowadays in ( relativistic as well as non ",
    "relativistic ) second  order calculations . within this approach , a finite set of discrete pseudostates",
    "is constructed from some basis functions and utilized for computing the transition amplitude @xmath75 @xcite . in the present work we use an alternative , _",
    "function approach _ that helps to avoid the direct summation over the ( virtual ) intermediate states @xmath50 . in the framework of this alternative approach ,",
    "moreover , we employ the sturmian representation @xcite of the radial components of the green s function that allows the _ analytical _ evaluation of the transition amplitudes ( [ mfi ] ) and , further down , of the entanglement measures .",
    "in contrast to hydrogen  like ions , the relativistic second  order calculations for few ",
    "electron systems are more intricate , since one has to take into account electron ",
    "electron interaction effects . in the high@xmath0 domain",
    ", however , the radiative transitions in few  electron ions can be reasonably well understood within the ipm .",
    "this model , which takes the pauli principle into account , is especially justified for heavy species , since the inter ",
    "electronic effects scale with @xmath76 and , hence , are much weaker than the electron  nucleus interaction .",
    "the great advantage of ipm is that it allows the decomposition of the many  body , second  order transition amplitudes in terms of their one  electron analogs ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) . in section [ sub_sec_helium ]",
    ", we will apply this approach for the computation of the spin  entanglement between photons emitted in the decay of heavy helium  like ions .",
    "the reduced density matrix ( [ dm ] ) contains complete information about the spin states of the photon pairs emitted in the decay of atoms or ions .",
    "together with the transition amplitude ( [ mfi ] ) , it is suitable to explore two  photon transitions also in the high@xmath0 domain , where relativistic and non  dipole effects are significant .",
    "however , before we perform such a fully  relativistic analysis , let us restrict ourselves first to the _ non  relativistic dipole _ theory and derive approximate expressions for the description of the two  photon polarization states . as we will see later , this will provide intuitive insight into the entanglement properties of the photon pairs .",
    "moreover , by comparing predictions of such a simplified dipole approach with the results of the fully  relativistic theory , we will be able to identify the relativistic and multipole effects in the two  photon transitions .    by making use of the non  relativistic dipole approximation for the electron ",
    "photon interaction and by restricting the intermediate ",

    "in contrast , in this representation ( [ five_state ] ) we immediately see that perpendicular emission under @xmath103 results in a _ product _ ( non  entangled , or separable ) photon spin state .",
    "the quantitative analysis of entanglement for the emitted photon pair will be performed in the following sections , based on our general expression ( [ dmgen ] ) , as well as on the dipole approximation ( [ seven_state])([five_state ] ) .",

    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eight_state ] ) that the second photon is then found in a linearly polarized state .",
    "the direction of this linear polarization , characterized by the angle @xmath106 , depends on the opening angle @xmath12 and on the polarization angle @xmath19 of the first photon : @xmath107 as we will show later , such a definite ( except for the opening angle @xmath103 ) correspondence between the linear polarizations does not generally imply maximal entanglement of the photon pairs . to understand this issue and to quantify the degree of entanglement we shall introduce , in section [ sec_concurrence ] , the concurrence measure .",

    "photon interaction , we again find the photon pair in a pure state : @xmath111 here , @xmath83 is the normalization constant , and the energy  dependent functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 are given in terms of the multipole , second - order reduced transition amplitudes @xmath114 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .    as seen from eq .",
    "( [ ketp ] ) , the spin  state of the photons emitted in the @xmath9 transition depends on the energy sharing @xmath115 .",
    "no simple analytical expression for this dependence can be derived in general , owing to the complicated structure of the functions @xmath116 and @xmath117 . however , if both photons carry away the same fraction of the energy , @xmath118 , the function @xmath119 vanishes , and the vector ( [ ketp ] ) represents a maximally entangled ( bell ) state : @xmath120 by comparing this expression with eq .",

    "moreover , no angular dependence arises in the state vector ( [ kketp ] ) implying maximal entanglement between the photons spins , irrespective of the particular decay geometry .",
    "we are ready now to discuss the concept of entanglement for the emitted photon pairs and to introduce a proper measure for it . in this way , let us first return to the _ full _ two  photon state which accounts not only for the spin but also for the spatial degrees of freedom . within the non  relativistic dipole approximation ( [ five_state ] ) , such a state _",

    "the above state can be written as product state neither in the energies nor in the emission angles or in the polarization .",
    "it can hence be seen as highly entangled , in general .    in order to rigorously discuss entanglement , due to the identity of particles , a degree of freedom for discrimination",
    "is needed .",
    "the energy of the photons and their opening angles are an appropriate choice , since one naturally projects onto energy and momentum eigenstates in the experiment . in the coincidence experiment displayed in fig .",

    "if the energies of the photons are equal and the emission directions exactly the same , we are not able to identify two separated particles between which entanglement may be defined .",
    "as long as this is not the case , we identify the particle projected on the two energies and angles as the two distinct entities to which we can safely assign an entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "hence , even though we start with a rather complex state of identical particles in which no physical subsystem structure is apparent , we can effectively deal with the two  qubit system of polarized photons projected on energy and momentum states .",

    "the general behaviour of the measure @xmath203 is very similar to that of the @xmath86 and @xmath7 transitions .",

    "similar to the discussion in section [ sub_sec_hydrogen ] , this can be easily understood if one applies again the momentum projection selection rules and eq .",
    "( [ a_pi2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath86 and @xmath7 transitions , however , the degree of entanglement @xmath203 drops down much faster for the forward @xmath205 and backward @xmath206 angles ; an effect that can be understood if we remember that the initial ionic state is prepared in an unpolarized ( mixed ) state .    as one can see from fig .  [ fig5 ] , spin entanglement for the @xmath207 transition is very sensitive to higher multipoles in the electron  photon interaction .",
    "this is a direct consequence of a strong suppression of the @xmath182 decay channel caused by the symmetry properties of the multi ",

    "entanglement if observed in @xmath7 and @xmath86 transitions in hydrogen and helium  like ions , respectively . by comparing predictions of the dipole approximation with the fully  relativistic calculations , we were able to explore the influence of the relativistic effects on the photon polarization properties .",
    "in particular , we observed a reduction of entanglement that becomes more sizable for high@xmath0 systems and that can be attributed to the loss of purity of the two  photon spin states induced by higher multipole contributions and the relativistic contraction of the wave  functions .    beside the well ",

    "the strongest non  dipole effects have been identified for the @xmath202 two  photon transition for which the @xmath182 decay channel is forbidden due to symmetry properties of the system .",
    "our theoretical analysis , performed for the intermediate and high @xmath0 domain , underlines the importance of detailed knowledge on the electronic structure of ions ( atoms ) for a better understanding of two  photon entanglement .",
    "this is rather different from the earlier studies on the decay of light neutral atoms @xcite where the quantum correlations between the photons could be predicted solely from angular  momentum conservation . in contrast , for heavy ions , entanglement properties of the photon pairs are governed by the complicated interplay between these conservation laws and relativistic as well as many ",
