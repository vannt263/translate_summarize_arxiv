    "understanding the nature of broken symmetry phases in the thermodynamic phase diagram of the cuprates is a key step toward understanding the origin of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "for example , the discovery of the pseudogap @xcite has fueled the search for many kinds of order @xcite , including nematic phases that could strongly enhance @xmath1 @xcite . yet of the broken symmetries connected to unconventional superconductivity , antiferromagnetism remains one of the most important , appearing in cuprate , iron - pnictide , organic , and heavy fermion materials @xcite .",
    "unambiguous evidence of the presence of fermi surface reconstruction arising from broken symmetry order has come from quantum oscillation measurements in both hole - doped @xcite and electron - doped @xcite cuprates at low temperatures and high magnetic fields , but the nature of the broken symmetry remains a matter of considerable debate .",
    "antiferromagnetic ( @xmath0 ) reconstruction has been proposed for both the hole- and electron - doped materials @xcite , but recent evidence for a ( possibly field - induced ) charge density wave @xcite has suggested more complex orders are driving the reconstruction .",
    "the ability to experimentally differentiate between these different ordered states is crucial . in this work",
    ", we suggest that interlayer angle - dependent magnetoresistance oscillations ( amro ) can be used to distinguish different kinds of long - range ordered states in the cuprates .",
    "angle - dependent magnetoresistance is a sensitive probe of the fermi surface of a material @xcite and can therefore be used to investigate the geometry of a reconstructed fermi surface .",
    "the measurement is also sensitive to the energy scale of any ( translational ) symmetry - breaking order @xcite .",
    "this energy scale is related to a  magnetic breakdown field , \" as we will describe below .",
    "importantly , these effects on amro can be observed even in materials that do not show quantum oscillations .",
    "thus , the measurement is useful in systems in which sample disorder is high , or in which the order has a small correlation length @xcite .",
    "amro data from provided the earliest transport evidence for the existence of a three - dimensional fermi surface in an overdoped cuprate @xcite .",
    "the temperature evolution of the amro is consistent with a superposition of isotropic and anisotropic scattering rates about the fermi surface @xcite , and it was determined that these do not have the same temperature dependence : the isotropic scattering rate is quadratic with temperature ( as expected of an ordinary fermi liquid ) while the anisotropic scattering rate is linear ( connecting it to the non - fermi liquid physics of the cuprate phase diagram ) .",
    "additionally , the anisotropic scattering is strongest in the anti - nodal region of the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested that the anomalous scattering temperature dependence may be related to ( @xmath0 ) fluctuations@xcite , possibly originating from antiferromagnetism .",
    "we show that the effects of such order on the amro can indeed make a natural connection with the physics of the observed scattering anisotropy , even though there is no static order in the system .",
    "we demonstrate this connection by simulating the amro of a model cuprate material in the presence of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the interpretation of amro measurements requires efficient and versatile calculations of the magnetotransport of a given fermi surface so that models can be compared to experimental results .",
    "these calculations are more challenging in the presence of static order that reconstructs the fermi surface .",
    "we have developed a general method to perform such calculations for quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) materials , based on previous work in organic metals @xcite .",
    "it is both easy to implement and computationally inexpensive . in section [ sec : model ]",

    "we must take the effect of these mb junctions into account when calculating conductivity .",
    "the conductivity of a q2d material in a magnetic field can be calculated using the shockley tube integral form of the boltzmann transport equation @xcite ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the initial azimuthal position of the quasiparticle and @xmath16 is its position after some time @xmath17 has passed to rewrite the bounds of integration as given by ziman .",

    "we can write @xmath24 and therefore convert our integral over @xmath20 to one over @xmath21 .    since amro is a probe of interlayer conductivity ,",
    "we want to calculate @xmath25 .",
    "this means we need an expression for @xmath26 , which we can obtain from a symmetry - constrained model of the fermi surface .",

    "see appendix [ app : params ] for more information on our determination of these parameters .",
    "we used geometric methods to solve for @xmath9 and @xmath37 in this system , as explained in appendices [ app : xi ] and [ app : deltas ] respectively . to study the temperature - dependent amro above 4.2 k we allowed only two free parameters : @xmath69 and @xmath12 .",
    "note that in contrast to ref .",
    ", @xmath61 is fixed to be _ isotropic _ with azimuthal angle @xmath16 .",
    "we ran simulations across a large range of parameter space and used a least - squares fitting approach to determine the values of @xmath69 and @xmath12 at each temperature .",
    "our best fit to the data is shown in figure [ fig : fit ] , showing excellent quantitative agreement with the amro of .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath69 and @xmath12 can be extracted from these simulations , and these are shown in figure [ fig : params ] .    as can be seen in figure [ fig : amro ] , more features are apparent in the amro when @xmath61 is higher , making it easier to distinguish the effects of changing @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath69 is decreased ( by lowering magnetic fields , raising temperatures , or lowering sample quality ) , each quasiparticle will traverse less of the fermi surface before it scatters .",
    "as illustrated in figure 6 of ref .",
    ", this causes the amplitude of amro to be reduced , which makes an accurate determination of @xmath12 more difficult .",
    "thus , the error of our fitting parameters is greater at higher temperatures . indeed , ref .",
    "includes amro data taken at 90 k and 110 k , but we were not able to accurately determine @xmath12 at those elevated temperatures .    while ref .",
    "reproduced the observed amro using an anisotropic scattering rate , we find good quantitative agreement with the data using a magnetic breakdown model with an isotropic scattering rate .",
    "bragg scattering at a mb junction mimics the effect of an anisotropic scattering rate on an unreconstructed fermi surface .",
    "however , importantly the magnetic breakdown model connects specific parts of the fermi surface in a single ( bragg ) scattering event , while the anisotropic scattering rate is a broad modulation of the quasiparticle lifetime about the fermi surface .",
    "the similarity of the two models in reproducing the amro suggests that the apparent anisotropic scattering rate is a symptom of antiferromagnetism , perhaps involving short - range fluctuations .",
    "this could explain the different temperature dependence of the isotropic and anisotropic components of the scattering rate observed in ref . .",
    "the behavior of @xmath61 in figure [ fig : params](a ) indicates a natural ( approximately linear ) increase in the scattering rate with temperature .",
    "the evolution of @xmath12 may reflect deeper physics . as shown in figure [ fig : params](b ) , @xmath12 increases quickly with temperature , peaking around 45 k. the parameter @xmath12 is a measure of the probability of bragg scattering . for a static reconstructed fermi surface , this is related to the separation between reconstructed sections , which is in turn proportional to the bandgap @xcite .",
    "therefore , under static reconstruction we would expect @xmath12 to be largest at 0 k and decrease weakly with increasing temperature @xcite . in the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations",
    ", similar scattering events might still occur at points where the reconstructed brillouin zone intersects the fermi surface . in this case",
    ", @xmath12 will play two roles : in addition to parameterizing the separation between sections of fermi surface , it also reflects the probability of bragg scattering within the time / length - scale of the fluctuations . , where @xmath70 parameterizes the temperature - dependent strength of fluctuations .",
    "however , adding extra parameters in this way does not add any clarity to our interpretation of the amro data . ]",
    "note that in the overdoped cuprates , there is a known crossover in the transport from fermi liquid- to non fermi liquid - like behavior with increasing temperature that is thought to be associated with critical fluctuations @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "the increase of @xmath12 with temperature ( figure [ fig : params](b ) ) can be interpreted as an increase in antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "as the temperature rises and antiferromagnetic fluctuations grow , quasiparticles have a non - zero chance of undergoing bragg diffraction when they reach mb junctions , so @xmath12 attains a non - zero value . at still higher temperatures ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlation time is so short that the effect of bragg scattering decreases , resulting in a decrease in @xmath12 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath12 looks strikingly similar to the evolution of the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility im@xmath71 ( which is a measure of the magnetic scattering ) seen in a number of neutron experiments in cuprate superconductors ; consider , for example , figure 10 of ref . .",
    "we therefore suggest that the temperature dependence of @xmath12 in figure [ fig : params](b ) reflects the effect of antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the magnetotransport .    for the above to be plausible , the antiferromagnetic fluctuations of the system should be on a long enough timescale to affect the quasiparticles motion about the fermi surface : the timescale of an antiferromagnetic fluctuation should be longer than the time it takes for a quasiparticle to traverse a section of fermi surface from one mb junction to the next .",
    "the antiferromagnetic fluctuations in near optimal doping have a frequency that is roughly linearly proportional to temperature @xcite . taking this as a guide",
    ", we estimate that the timescale of an antiferromagnetic fluctuation will be of the order @xmath72 .",
    "meanwhile , the time for a quasiparticle to cross the smallest section of fermi surface between two mb junctions is given by @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , our condition @xmath74 is equivalent to @xmath75    for this system the requirement is approximately @xmath76 using @xmath77 @xcite , we find @xmath78 at 45 t. therefore , antiferromagnetic fluctuations could be expected to affect quasiparticle motion up to @xmath79 400 k , much higher than the temperature regime studied in this paper .    the magnetic breakdown picture of the effect of antiferromagnetic fluctuations on amro could be substantially improved by including a more realistic model of the mb junctions in a fluctuating system that includes , for example , a distribution of ordering wavevectors about ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this simple model captures many of the important features observed in the temperature - dependent amro without the need for a multi - component scattering with a different nodal and anti - nodal temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "indeed , the success of this simple model indirectly connects this unusual scattering anisotropy to antiferromagnetism , which may be useful for understanding other transport properties ( see appendix [ app : inplane ] ) .",
    "moreover , our results suggest there is a potential link between @xmath12 and the dynamic susceptibility im@xmath71 .",
    "if this connection can find a sound theoretical basis , it may open the way for the use of amro as an experimental probe of magnetic scattering .",
    "we have developed a simple and computationally inexpensive numerical method to calculate amro in layered two - dimensional materials with ( @xmath0 ) antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this model can be applied to both hole- and electron - doped cuprates with an appropriately adjusted fermi surface parameterization for direct comparison with experimental data . in addition",
    ", our numerical method can easily be applied to ordered states other than antiferromagnetism , such as the charge - ordered states recently proposed in underdoped @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have shown that an antiferromagnetic fermi surface reconstruction with a temperature - dependent magnetic breakdown field can fit the amro of , an overdoped compound with no static order .",
    "the agreement between our fits and the amro data suggest that the apparent scattering anisotropy observed in these systems@xcite is connected to antiferromagnetic fluctuations , and indeed that the mb field , @xmath12 , can potentially be used as an experimental measure of such fluctuations .",
    "this would make amro a good complement to scattering probes of fluctuations , such as neutron scattering and resonant inelastic x - ray scattering .",
    "we propose that future amro experiments at higher magnetic fields and in materials where im@xmath71 has been determined independently by neutron scattering would provide an instructive comparison to test the validity of this connection .",

    "we would expect the parameters @xmath59 to be constant with temperature , as they describe the fermi surface geometry .",
    "therefore , we can fit these parameters from our 4.2 k data since we do not expect reconstruction and magnetic breakdown to occur at this temperature . from band structure calculations",

    "we obtained the best fits to data from @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "once we have fit these parameters at 4.2 k , the only parameters free to fit for the data as a function of temperature are @xmath12 and @xmath149 .",
    "for each temperature we simulated conductivity across a broad range of @xmath12 and @xmath149 and used a least - squares fitting to arrive at the following values for the best fits to data :    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      +   + @xmath150we assumed @xmath151 at 4.2 k in order to perform our fits for fermi surface geometry and alignment .",
    "the error bars shown on @xmath12 and @xmath149 in the main text are the standard error of those parameters . at each temperature , the values of @xmath12 and @xmath149 that give the best fit to data are those for which the sum of squared error ( sse ) between data and simulation is minimized .",
    "we can fit the sse to a functional form in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath149 about that minimum .",
    "we use this functional form to approximate the hessian matrix for these two parameters , the inverse of which is the covariance matrix , @xmath152 .",

    "the procedure is then nearly identical to that for @xmath25 , though slightly simplified by the fact that the @xmath37 terms are not involved in the in - plane calculations .",
    "we can calculate in - plane conductivity exactly , whereas we can only calculate @xmath25 up to a constant of proportionality since we do not know the value of @xmath28 .    rather than calculating the in - plane transport terms and fitting them to experimental data ,",
    "we want to see what predictions we can make for in - plane transport based on our analysis of the interlayer transport .",
    "we fit the points from figure [ fig : params ] in the main text to analytical functions : a second - order polynomial in temperature for @xmath158 , and a function of the form @xmath159 for @xmath12 , as we expect that at higher temperatures @xmath12 must decrease due to weakening antiferromagnetic correlations .    using these analytical functions of our temperature - dependent parameters , we are able to calculate the in - plane transport of at any temperature  though such calculations should be interpreted with care because we are extrapolating to higher temperatures using information that comes from 50 k and below",
    ". we can compare these calculations to data taken from comparable samples by mackenzie _",
    "@xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : inplane ] .",
    "note that the data presented in these figures come from a sample with @xmath1 of 15 k , the same critical temperature as the sample whose amro data we have analyzed .",
    "our simulations of in - plane transport are qualitatively similar to experimental data , though they do not agree quantitatively , especially the hall angle and hall coefficient .",
    "it is important to note that in the magnetic breakdown model , where @xmath160 plays an important role , we do not have drude - like resistivity : @xmath161 is not directly proportional to the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we would have to use hall data taken at 45 t to truly make a meaningful comparison .",
    "we can not simply lower the magnetic field strength in our calcuations to match the field at which data was taken , as we only have information on @xmath12 for a 45 t field .",
    "it has been proposed that antiferromagnetism in the cuprates is enhanced by an applied magnetic field @xcite and therefore we can not assume that the value of @xmath12 at lower fields matches that at 45 t.    we show these results not because they definitively support or contradict the magnetic breakdown model , but merely in the spirit of sharing the results of our explorations .",
    "given that we do not know the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath162 , it seems unlikely that such in - plane calculations can yield strong evidence for or against the suggested model .",
