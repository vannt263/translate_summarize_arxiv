    "recently there has been a measurement of the form factors in the semi - leptonic decay @xmath11 @xcite , where a fit to the data was done using the model of krner and kramer @xcite .",
    "the model , constructed within the framework of hqet , treats both the charm quark and the strange quark as heavy and considers @xmath12 expansion keeping @xmath13 .",
    "even though the model has only one input parameter , use of @xmath12 expansion is questionable and the omission of @xmath14 corrections is also not justified . for a heavy to light transition , for example of the type @xmath15 ,",
    "the use of hqet in the limit @xmath16 allows one to express all the form factors in terms of only two form factors @xcite .",
    "semileptonic decays of @xmath17 have been studied in this limit @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we constructed a model for the form - factors which takes into account @xmath18 corrections for heavy - to - light transitions of the @xmath19 type baryon ( light degrees in spin 0 state ) . in this work we use the form factors calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the decays @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section we present the formulae for the calculation of asymmetries and decay rates for the semi - leptonic decays @xmath5 and @xmath6 while in the third section we present our results .",
    "here we present the formalism for the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the hadronic part of the amplitude is the matrix elements of the weak quark current between baryonic states that is parametrized in terms of form factors .",
    "we define the six vector and axial vector form factors through the following equations @xmath22 u{_b{_q } } ( p , s ) \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that we can write the form factors in the above equation in terms of two form factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 provided some assumptions are made about the @xmath14 corrections . for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 semi - leptonic decays we will work in the approximation that the lepton mass is negligible .",
    "the decay @xmath28 proceeds via @xmath29 followed by @xmath30 .",
    "following @xcite we define the helicity amplitudes which are given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the polarizations of the daughter baryon and the w - boson respectively . in terms of the form",

    "the polar angles are defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . by integrating over two of the angles one can look at the following distributions @xmath46 the first distribution in the above equation gives the polar angle distribution for the cascade decay @xmath47 .",
    "the second distribution is the polar angle distribution for the deacy @xmath48 , while the third distribution is the azimuthal angle distribution .",
    "the asymmetries are given by the expressions below @xcite and will depend only on the ratio @xmath49 in our model for the form factors @xmath50 for unpolarized @xmath0 . for polarized",
    "@xmath0 one has similar decay distributions and we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for the relevant details .",
    "we give here the expression for the asymmetries @xmath51 all the asymmetries have limiting values as @xmath52 .",
    "all the polar asymmetries vanish at this limit while the azimuthal asymmetryies @xmath53 and @xmath54 . at the @xmath55 point",
    "however the limiting value of the asymmetries @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 depend on the dynamics of the semi - leptonic decay and we will comment on this issue further in the next section . the other asymmetries @xmath59 and @xmath60 tends to zero while @xmath61 tend to @xmath62 in the @xmath55 point .",

    "@xcite , to the semileptonic decay data on @xmath66 uses the korner kramer(kk ) model to extract @xmath67 and the asymmetry @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "since , as already mentioned in the introduction , the kk model does not include @xmath14 corrections and the use of @xmath12 expansion is questionable , a more correct approach would be therefore to do a fit to the semi - leptonic data including @xmath14 corrections to extract the ratio @xmath68 and hence the asymmetries . the formula for the calculation of the absolute decay rate for the semi - leptonic decay of baryons",
    "is given in ref .",
    "in our analysis we have studied the semi - leptonic decays for @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in ref . @xcite",
    "we found the @xmath14 expansion to be valid for @xmath71 and from the study of non - leptonic two body charmed baryon decays @xmath72 was obtained ( we assumed @xmath73 ) . in our analysis",
    "we found that the @xmath18 corrections depend on the value of @xmath74 .",
    "as far as the @xmath18 corrections to the form factors are concerned for the @xmath0 decay the @xmath14 corrections to the form factors are @xmath75 for @xmath76 . for @xmath1",
    "decays the @xmath77 corrections are small and are less than @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "fig.1 shows @xmath80 versus @xmath81 for different @xmath82 values .",
    "we note that for @xmath83 the asymmetry @xmath56 is not very sensitive to @xmath74 .",
    "this feature is common to most of the calculated integrated asymmetries . in fig.2",
    "we show @xmath84 versus @xmath74 . in the kk model or in general with @xmath85 , @xmath86 for all @xmath74 .",
    "fig.2 shows the effect of including @xmath14 corrections . fig.3 and",
    "fig.4 show the predictions for the integrated asymmetries for different @xmath74 for unpolarised and polarised @xmath0 and except for @xmath60 we see that the integrated asymmetries are insensitive to r in the range @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath14 corrections to the integrated asymmetries again depend on the value of r and can be as large as @xmath87 .",
    "the decay rates depend on both @xmath74 and @xmath88 .",
    "so instead of calculating the individual decay rates for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to reduce the uncertainties from these sources we calculate the ratio of the decay rates which will depend only on @xmath74 as the factor @xmath88 cancels .",
    "fig.5 shows this ratio as a function of @xmath74 with and without @xmath18 corrections with a monopole and dipole form for the form factors .",
    "we see that the @xmath18 corrections are small for the dipole form factors .",
    "the ratio above will receive corrections of the order @xmath89 and higher where @xmath90 is the c or b quark .",
    "an estimate of these corrections will depend on the value of @xmath74 which can be extracted by performing a fit to the @xmath11 data .",
    "the final result can be written as @xmath91|\\frac{v_{ub}}{v_{cs}}|^{2}\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the ratio with @xmath93 and @xmath94 represents the corrections to the ratio due to @xmath95 corrections to the form factors .",
    "since we do not know @xmath74 we can make an estimate of the ratio above by using the value of @xmath74 extracted from non - leptonic charmed baryon decays with dipole form factors @xcite i.e @xmath96 .",
    "we write @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the derivative of @xmath99 at @xmath100 , and where @xmath101 may also include experimental uncertainties in extracting @xmath74 .",
    "so an estimate of the ratio defined in eqn.(9 ) can be made through the following approximation @xmath102|\\frac{v_{ub}}{v_{cs}}|^{2}\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for monopole and dipole form factors we then have @xmath103|\\frac{v_{ub}}{v_{cs}}|^{2}\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath104|\\frac{v_{ub}}{v_{cs}}|^{2}\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] naively we can set @xmath105 and so we see that @xmath106 for the dipole form factors and @xmath107 is negligible for the monopole form factors .",
    "measurement of the ratio @xmath108 can be used to extract @xmath109 .",
    "clearly the largest uncertainty in @xmath108 comes from the assumed @xmath81 dependence of the form factors and to reliably extract @xmath109 using @xmath108 the @xmath81 dependence of the form factors must be measured . our model for the form factors at @xmath110 can be tested by studying the decay distribution in @xmath111 . with enough statistical power such",
    "a study could determine the @xmath81 dependence of the form factors .",
    "so if our model for the form factors at @xmath110 is tested successfully by doing a fit to the @xmath111 decay distribution , and if @xmath74 and information on the @xmath81 dependence of form factors extracted , we can use the ratio in eqn.(9 ) to determine @xmath109 with a small error .",
    "it is interesting to compare this method of extracting @xmath109 and hence @xmath112 with other methods of extracting @xmath112 .",
    "one method is to use semi - leptonic inclusive @xmath113 decays and study the decay distribution near the end point of the spectrum in the narrow window @xmath114 gev @xcite .",
    "however in this region the @xmath115 transition is subject to large qcd radiative corrections as well as large non - perturbative corrections which are entangled with each other and theoretical calculations are model dependent .",
    "another way to extract @xmath112 is through the study of exclusive @xmath113 decays @xcite and this approach is similar to our approach with the difference that we are working with baryons instead of mesons .",
    "the calculations of form factors in exclusive decays of @xmath113 mesons are done in specific models , like the quark model , or with chiral lagrangian with heavy meson . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is suggested that @xmath116 may be extracted from the ratio of the lepton distribution in @xmath117 and @xmath118 with an theoretical uncertainty of 10 - 20 @xmath119 .",
    "the relevant form factors are calculated up to order @xmath18 in the soft pion limit with the additional assumption that only intermediate states degenerate with the ground state meson contribute and so the calculations of the form factors are model dependent . in ref .",
    "@xcite the ratio of the lepton distribution in @xmath120 and @xmath121 at maximum @xmath81 is used for an extraction of @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath18 corrections are calculated in quark model and the theoretical uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath116 is small . however at maximum @xmath81 the decay rates vanish , actual measurements are performed away from maximum @xmath81 where additional form factors contribute adding to the theoretical uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath116 .",
    "another approach to measuring @xmath116 , which is the mesonic counterpart of our method , is given in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) where experimental data on @xmath122 semi - leptonic decay are used to calculate the @xmath123 semileptonic decay .",
    "the @xmath81 dependence of the form factors is assumed to be of the monopole type , no @xmath18 corrections are considered and the extraction of @xmath116 is found to depend on the value of @xmath124 and @xmath125 whose values are not known very accurately . since most approaches to extracting @xmath116 from @xmath113 meson decays are model dependent and can involve significant theoretical uncertainties , extraction of @xmath116 using heavy baryon decays is interesting as it is possible that theoretical uncertainties in heavy baryon decays might be small .",
    "the predictions for the decay rates for @xmath126 and @xmath127 are subject to significant @xmath18 corrections and may not be reliable .",
    "nevertheless we give the predictions for the decay rates with @xmath128 and @xmath129@xcite @xmath130 the particle data group gives @xmath131 .",
    "measurement of @xmath132 is likely to be made at lep in the future .",
    "the numbers for the individual decay rates are calculated using @xmath133 @xcite , the pole masses @xmath134 gev and @xmath135 gev@xcite and the quark masses @xmath136 gev and @xmath137 gev@xcite    in conclusion we have studied the semi - leptonic decays of charmed and bottom baryons involving transition of a heavy to light quark based on a model for form factors that includes @xmath18 corrections .",
    "we also suggest a method for determining @xmath138 .                                        * the asymmetry @xmath80 versus @xmath81 for some representative values of the form factor ratio @xmath74 . * the asymmetry @xmath84 versus @xmath74 .",
