    "the start - up of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) opens for exploration the upcoming landscape of physics .",
    "our hope is that a strangeness standing up in the landscape of the standard model ( sm ) gives us ability to address the physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "three such landmarks are :    lightness of neutrinos ,    heaviness of the top quark ,    lightness of the sm higgs doublet .",
    "the last landmark with special prominence , known as the _ hierarchy problem _ , reflects an inexplicable quantum stability of the weak scale _ v _ with respect to the uv cutoff . in order to tame the quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs mass ,",
    "various bsm approaches have been introduced , like little higgs , supersymmetry , technicolor and extra dimensions .",
    "the extensions of the sm aimed at explaining lightness of neutrinos came as if on cue for the gut programme @xcite . by integrating out the gut - scale degrees of freedom one arrives at the tree level at neutrino masses through an effective dimension - five operator@xcite @xmath3 .",
    "the heavy fermion singlet and triplet mediators result in the dimension - five operator through type i and type iii seesaw mechanisms@xcite .",
    "they produce small neutrino mass @xmath4 at the cost of introducing a new hierarchy problem of the seesaw scale @xmath5 gev with respect to @xmath6 . by admitting some of the gut - scale degrees of freedom to be as low as the tev scale as in a recent reincarnation of @xmath7 gut model@xcite ,",
    "one arrives at a low scale hybrid type i and iii seesaw model .",
    "multiple seesaw approach introduced by ma@xcite and extended@xcite later , brings the seesaw mechanism to the tev scale@xcite accessible at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "recent lowering@xcite of the seesaw scale by dim = 7 operator and with a focus on the triple charged scalars has led to @xmath8 .",
    "this study has followed an earlier observation of the efficiency of higher scalar multiplets in suppressing neutrino masses@xcite .    here",
    "we describe our recent work@xcite which aims at a lowering the seesaw scale in a `` bottom - up '' approach , by extending the sm particle content by higher then sm weak isospin multiplets .",
    "an important assumption in our approach is that new fermionic degrees of freedom beyond the three sm generations are realized as vectorlike dirac states .",
    "we examined recently@xcite similar states in the quark sector represented by the vectorlike top partner which has dispayed the mass matrix corresponding to a dirac seesaw mechanism . in the following",
    "we will describe how this model explains the large mass of the top quark@xcite , and compare it with analogous dirac seesaw mechanism appearing in the particular extension@xcite of the supersymmetric sm .",
    "after that we present our novel seesaw mechanism@xcite for generating majorana masses of light neutrinos by dirac mediators , which is different from type i and iii seesaw mechanisms where both light neutrinos and heavy messengers are represented by majorana particles .",
    "we elaborated recently@xcite on the model with a vectorlike top - partner @xmath9 proposed by vysotsky@xcite .",
    "expressed in terms of the weak ( primed ) eigenstates , it reads in the form of the lagrangian that in addition to the usual sm piece has the bsm part consisting of two dirac mass terms and one yukawa term : @xmath10 + h.c . \\;\\ ; . \\label{1}\\ ] ] two new heavy @xmath11 singlet states , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , have the dirac mass term @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 mixing is given by two terms in the square brackets : the @xmath16 term describing the mixing of two @xmath11 singlets , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the @xmath19 term describing mixing of the sm weak isodoublet with the isosinglet state @xmath20 .",
    "obviously , by switching off these @xmath21 terms , the @xmath22 field would become the ordinary @xmath23 quark , the mass eigenstate of the sm .",
    "the presence of the @xmath24 mixing has several effects examined before@xcite .",
    "here we stress that , in order to find the states with definite masses the following matrix should be diagonalized : @xmath25 from here we can explain the heaviness of top@xcite . by switching of the mass of @xmath23 quark in sm , i.e. by putting @xmath26 , top quark massless in sm gets all its mass @xmath27 from the mixing with heavy @xmath9",
    ".      the seesaw mechanism resembling the one based on eq.([mass_matrix_top ] ) appears in neutrino sector in the particular extension of the supersymmetric sm proposed by ma@xcite .",
    "he added a new @xmath28 gauge symmetry and new supermultiplets at the tev scale to solve both the @xmath29 problem and the absence of the neutrino masses in the mssm .",
    "additional isospin singlet fermions mix with light neutrinos and span the following mass matrix in the basis @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are independent fields . in this model the lepton number is conserved and the light neutrinos are dirac fermions with mass given by @xmath34 . here",
    "the mass @xmath35 comes from the weak scale _ v _ , @xmath36 comes from @xmath28 symmetry breaking , and @xmath14 is an invariant mass .",
    "because both the light neutrinos and the heavy neutral states are dirac fermions , this mechanism is called a dirac seesaw .",
    "after the examples above , we can explore the possibility of a viable seesaw model with light majorana neutrinos by employing heavy dirac neutral states .",
    "in order to have dirac seesaw mediators we have to departure from hypercharge zero multiplets used in type i and iii seesaw mechanism . this can be achieved by invoking vectorlike fermionic multiplets which , although not restricted to the electroweak scale , could be light enough to avoid the hierarchy problem . in order to have a tree level seesaw , the newly introduced fermion multiplets have to contain a neutral component which mixes with light neutrinos .",
    "additional scalar multiplets have to be introduced in order to have yukawa terms necessary for fermionic tree level seesaw .",
    "this leads to restricted quantum number assignments for new fermionic multiplets : the vectorlike triplet@xcite and the vectorlike five - plet@xcite corresponding to effective dim = 7 and dim = 9 operators , which are additional to those presented in a previous study@xcite .",
    "our model@xcite obeys the sm gauge group @xmath37 symmetry .",
    "the fermions additional to those of the sm belong to vectorlike dirac five - plet @xmath38 of leptons , so that both their left @xmath39 and right @xmath40 components transform as @xmath41 .",
    "the vectorlike @xmath38 can form a gauge invariant dirac mass term @xmath42 the scalar multiplets needed for gauge invariant yukawa terms , @xmath43 are weak isospin @xmath44 scalar 4-plets @xmath45 and @xmath46 transforming as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( _ vevs _ ) of @xmath49 and @xmath50 fields in the yukawa terms in eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) result in the mass terms which connect the lepton doublet with new vectorlike lepton 5-plet .    if we restrict ourself to one sm lepton doublet @xmath51 , the three neutral left - handed components @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 span the mass matrix @xmath55 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 result from the first and second term of eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) , respectively , and @xmath56 is given by eq .",
    "( [ dir ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are on the scale of the _ vev _ @xmath57 and _ vev _ @xmath58 of the neutral components of the scalar quadruplets , but @xmath56 is on the new physics scale @xmath59 larger then the electroweak scale .",
    "after diagonalizing the mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ neutral_mass_matrix ] ) , the light neutrino acquires a majorana mass @xmath60 starting with heavy dirac lepton states , their mixing with both @xmath51 and @xmath61 results in light massive majorana neutrino .",
    "therefore , the lepton number is violated in our model .",
    "the difference between the type i and iii seesaw and our seesaw model can be understood by looking at the lepton number violation ( lnv ) . despite a freedom in assigning lepton numbers to new multiplets ,",
    "our vectorlike non - zero hypercharge seesaw messengers do not allow a lepton number assignment that would bring the lnv to the mass term as is the case in type i and iii seesaw .      turning to the scalar potential ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the following renormalizable terms relevant for our mechanism : @xmath62 for the _ vevs _ of the doublet and two 4-plets we assume the values : @xmath63 inserting these _ vevs _ into the vacuum value @xmath64 , we obtain @xmath65 where the numerical factors @xmath66 and @xmath67 are clebsch - gordan coefficients .    the conditions for the minima , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , give the equations for the vacuum stability : @xmath70 the electroweak symmetry breaking proceeds in the usual way from the _ vev _ @xmath6 of the higgs doublet , implying @xmath71 and @xmath72 despite the positiveness of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , there are non - vanishing induced _ vevs _ @xmath57 and @xmath58 , approximately given by @xmath75 by merging eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ phivev ] ) we obtain the light neutrino mass @xmath76 the _ vevs _ of our scalar multiplets change the @xmath77 parameter to @xmath78 and @xmath79 . by matching @xmath80 and @xmath81 to the experimental value@xcite @xmath82",
    ", we get the upper bounds @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 gev .",
    "we can estimate the high energy scale of our model from eq .",
    "( [ dim9 ] ) by assuming the same value for the mass parameters , @xmath85 . by taking values @xmath86 gev and @xmath87",
    "ev we obtain @xmath88 gev for @xmath89 .",
    "we also have two types of loop contributions , one steaming from closing @xmath90 legs in the tree - level diagram , and the other generated by @xmath91 term in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) . with characteristic loop suppression factor ,",
    "the first loop contribution is smaller then the tree level one if@xcite @xmath92 tev , and the second if @xmath93 gev . obviously , the later numerical value has to be taken conditionally , and has a meaning of a bound of a few 100 gev , meaning that all new states in our model should lie below @xmath94 tev .",
    "such states are expected to be abundantly produced at hadronic colliders through @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 drell - yan fusion processes .",
    "the associated production of the pairs @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 via a charged current is a crucial test of the five - plet nature of new leptons .",
    "direct pair production of neutral states @xmath102 via a neutral current , which is not possible for type i and iii mediators , is possible for our states with non - zero weak charges .",
    "vectorlike fermions of the type considered here are characterized by small mass splitting within a multiplet@xcite .",
    "the hierarchy within the @xmath38 multiplet can be read out from@xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the mass splitting between @xmath105 and @xmath106 components in the case of zero hypercharge : @xmath107 we find that @xmath108 is the lightest component of the 5-plet , being 210 mev lighter then @xmath109 .",
    "additional small mass splitting@xcite within the 5-plet comes from the mixing of the 5-plet components with the sm leptons , but this is of the order of @xmath110 ev which is totally negligible .",
    "let us finally list the decays providing distinctive signatures of @xmath38 states at the colliders .",
    "a triply charged @xmath111 decays through an off - shell @xmath112 , leading typically to @xmath113 decay .",
    "a doubly charged state decays as @xmath114 the singly charged states decays as @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "finally , a neutral seesaw mediator decays as @xmath117 .    to conclude , there is a number of processes@xcite which should point to the existence of the 5-plet states under consideration , if they explain the neutrino masses at the tree level .",
    "it is gratifying that the parameter space corresponding to the novel tree - level model will be tested at the lhc , so that this model is falsifiable .",
    "a very non - discovery of the fermionic 5-plet states would leave us with a possibility of their role in neutrino mass generation at the loop - level .",
