    "cepheids are important standard candles in determining the extra - galactic distance scale .",
    "the results of the hipparcos  mission allowed a calibration of the galactic period - luminosity ( @xmath11 ) relation in the @xmath12-band ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13-bands ( lanoix et al .",
    "1999a ) and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath10 and the reddening - free wesenheit index ( groenewegen & oudmaijer 2000 , hereafter go00 ) .",
    "feast & catchpole ( 1997 ) and go00 combined these data with available data on lmc cepheids to determine the distance to the lmc .",
    "it is well know that the infrared has some considerable advantages over the optical region for deriving distances .",
    "first of all the problem of reddening is less important , and second , as summarised in go00 , the effect of metallicity on the @xmath5-relation seems to be less . of the 236 cepheids  in the sample considered in go00 , only 63 have sufficiently well determined infrared light curves to determine accurate intensity - mean magnitudes ( also see groenewegen 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the number of magellanic clouds ( mcs ) cepheids  with well determined infrared lightcurves is also rather small , of order 20 in each cloud ( laney & stobie , 1994 , 1986a ) .    the micro lensing surveys have increased the number of known cepheids  in the mcs tremendously and they provide optical photometry for many of them . in particularly ,",

    "complementary , in the infrared , the 2mass  survey is an ongoing all - sky survey in the @xmath0 near - infrared bands , that , when completed , will contain of order 300 million stars ( beichman et al .",
    "the 2mass  team released their second incremental data set in march 2000 , that includes the mc area . in parallel ,",

    "4 ) , and @xmath5-relations in @xmath7 for fundamental mode and first overtone pulsators derived ( sect .  5 ) .",
    "the results are discussed in sect .",
    "u99b , c describe the dataset regarding cepheids  in the direction of the lmc and smc , obtained in course of the ogle - ii micro lensing survey .",
    "twenty - one fields in the central parts of the lmc , and 11 fields in the central parts of the smc of size 14.2@xmath1457  each were observed in @xmath15 , with an absolute photometric accuracy of 0.01 - 0.02 mag .",
    "u99b , c present tables per field , with ( amongst other items ) identification number , pulsation period , @xmath15 photometry , @xmath16 and pulsation mode .",
    "the @xmath16 value was derived by them using red clump stars , and the pulsation mode was derived by them from two fourier parameters derived from the @xmath13-band lightcurve ( see u99b , c for details ) . these data were obtained from the ogle  homepage ( http://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/@xmath17ogle/ ) in april 2000 .",
    "as noted in u99b , c there are about a 100 objects in each cloud that appear in 2 or more fields .",
    "they provide a list with the relevant field and identification number , but i did this positional correlation independently .",
    "values for the photometry , period and @xmath16 were averaged where appropriate .",
    "the final number of cepheids detected by ogle  in the lmc is 1335 , and in the smc 2048 .",
    "the 2mass  survey is an ongoing single - epoch all - sky survey in the @xmath0 near - infrared bands . on march 2 , 2000",
    "the 2mass  team released the second incremental data set , that includes the mc area .",
    "the easiest way to check if a star is included in this release is by uplinking a source table with coordinates to the 2masshomepage .",
    "such a table was prepared including the 1335 lmc and 2048 smc cepheids in ogle  and 236 cepheids  in the hipparcos  catalog considered in go00 . the correlation between the source list and the 2mass  database was at first instance done using a search radius of 5 .",
    "inspection of the match between the ogle  and hipparcos  cepheids  and 2massindicated a much better positional coincidence .",
    "this is to be expected as the 2mass  positional accuracy is @xmath180.2  ( cutri et al . 2000 ) and the internal accuracy of the ogle  database is about 0.15with possible systematic errors of @xmath180.7  ( u99b , c ) . in quite a few cases",
    "there was a second 2mass  source ( not the counterpart ) within the search radius of 5 .",
    "the match between 2mass  and hipparcos  was excellent with the largest positional difference being 0.56 . in view of this , a second and final correlation was made for the hipparcos  and ogle  cepheidsusing a search radius of 1 .",
    "seventy - two correlations were found with the hipparcos  cepheids , 1511 with the ogle  smc , and 894 with the oglelmc cepheids .",
    "the small number of correlations with hipparcos  is due to the fact that the 2mass  survey is not yet complete in sky coverage .    on this",
    "2mass  dataset a further selection was performed to retain only those sources with reliable @xmath7 photometry in all three bands .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall here that the `` rd - flg '' in the 2mass  database gives essential information on the quality of the magnitudes ( cutri et al .",
    "2000 ) . in particular ,",
    "objects where the rd - flg is 0 ( indicating an upper limit ) or 3 or 8 ( indicating saturation ) in any of the three bands are eliminated .",
    "the final 2mass  database of cepheids  consists of 52 hipparcos  cepheids  ( not discussed further ) , 825 ogle  lmc and 920 ogle  smc cepheids .",
    "the 2mass  and ogle  coverage of the lmc are not identical , and no 2mass  sources are found in ogle  fields lmc - sc6 , 7 and 21 .",
    "the denis  survey is a survey of the southern sky in @xmath1 ( epchtein et al .",
    "1999 ) . in april 2000 ,",
    "a point source catalog was released containing sources and single - epoch photometry in the direction of the mcs ( cioni et al .",
    "a subset of 264347 lmc and 69829 smc sources detected in all three band was obtained using ftp from www.strw.leidenuniv.nl ( cd /pub / ldac / dcmc ) .",
    "these were correlated against the ogle  survey on position . as both ogle  and deniscontain @xmath13-band data it was possible to verify how the average difference between the ogle  and denis  @xmath13-data depends on the search radius .",
    "since the ogle  data contain intensity - mean magnitudes , but the denis  data are single - epoch data , one has to allow for variability .",
    "for the smc , and a search radius of 2 , 93 cross - correlations were found .",
    "the average difference in position is 0.68 and the mean absolute difference in @xmath13 is 0.18 mag .",
    "however , for the 21 stars with a positional difference larger than 1 , 9 ( or 43% ) have a difference in @xmath13 of larger than 0.8 mag , which is a typical value for the amplitude for a cepheid in the @xmath13-band .",
    "for the stars with a positional differences less than 1 , this is only 5 out of 67 or 7% .",
    "given the internal accuracy of the positions in the denis  survey of 0.5  ( epchtein et al . 1999 ) , a search radius of 1seems appropriate to reduce the number of spurious associations , which is supported by the large fraction of highly deviant @xmath13-band data when a larger search radius is used .",
    "as discussed below some true identifications are missed in this way however . also some false coincidences are undoubtedly included ( as for the correlation of oglewith 2mass ) but these will be removed using sigma - clipping when deriving @xmath11relations . using a search radius of 1",
    "the number of correlations between denis  and ogle  is 71 in the smc , and 102 in the lmc , for stars with good photometry in all three bands    it was verified whether all correlations between denis  and ogle  were also found in the match between 2mass  and ogle .",
    "of the 71 smc ogle  + denisstars , 61 are also found in 2mass . in three of the 10 cases where there is no match this was due to the positional difference which was @xmath19  between ogle  and 2mass . in the other 7 cases it is less clear , possibly related to the variable nature of the objects . of the 102 lmc",
    "ogle  + denis  stars , 80 were also found in 2mass . in one of the 22 other cases this was due to a positional difference of @xmath19between ogle  and 2mass , and @xmath20  between ogle  and denis .",
    "one case is puzzling , and the other 20 cases are all in ogle  fields lmc - sc6 , 7 , 21 , which apparently have not been covered by 2mass .",
    "the number of correlations beween denis  and ogle  is much less than the number of correlations between ogle  and 2mass .",
    "some tests using denis  data of sources detected in @xmath13 and @xmath21 only , showed that this is mainly due to the lack of detections in @xmath10 .",
    "some tests in a few ogle  fields showed that there may be an equal number of cepheids  in ogle  with denis  @xmath13 and @xmath21 photometry . in any case",
    "it is clear however , that for the purpose of determining @xmath5-relations in the infrared using the largest possible samples , the 2mass  survey is of more interest , because it reaches fainter magnitudes .    in appendix",
    "a a comparison is presented between the denis  @xmath13 and ogle@xmath13 and denis  @xmath22 and 2mass  @xmath22 photometry .",
    "this has its limitations since the comparison is done using variable stars . yet",
    "it may still be of some interest to other workers , as such a comparison has not been done yet .",
    "the photometry presented by the 2mass - team is on the natural system .",
    "however , many of the extisting infrared photometry on both galactic ( laney & stobie 1992 , groenewegen 1999 ) and mc cepheids ( laney & stobie 1994 ) is on the carter ( 1990 ) system or has been transformed to that system .",
    "it is therefere imperative to estimate any systematic differences between the carter and the natural 2mass  system .    from carter ( 1990 ) and carter & meadows ( 1995 )",
    "116 stars with @xmath23 were taken , and a table with coordinates was uplinked to the 2masshomepage to perform a search on position using a search radius of 2 .",
    "thirty - four matches were found ; the largest positional difference was 1.2 .",
    "however , not all entries are useful as some of the brighter stars still saturate the 2mass  detectors in one or more bands , despite the a - priori exclusion of stars with @xmath24 .",
    "the vast majority of stars in 2mass  have `` default magnitudes obtained using profile - fit photometry performed simultaneously on the combination of all six individual 1.3-seconds `` read 2-read 1 '' ( r2-r1 ) exposures '' ( cutri et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these sources have rd - flg = 2 in the appropriate band .",
    "sources brighter than 7 - 8 magnitudes will saturate in the 1.3-s r2-r1 exposures .",
    "these objects have default magnitudes from aperture photometry performed on the 51-millisec r1 frames .",
    "such sources have rd - flg = 1 in the appropriate band .",
    "stars brighter than approximately fifth magnitude will saturate in even the 51-millisec exposures .",
    "the rd - flg value for the appropriate band is 3 .    among the 34 sources ,",
    "there are 15 sources with rd - flg = 111 , 10 with rd - flg = 112 , 1 with rd - flg = 122 , 4 with rd - flg = 222 and 4 sources with rd - flg = 3 in atleast one of the bands .",
    "the latter were not considered .",
    "figure  1 plots the differences `` carter - 2mass '' versus @xmath25 ( 2mass ) , and `` 2mass - carter '' versus @xmath25 ( carter ) in @xmath7 .",
    "for these nearby stars reddening is neglected .",
    "the errors in the individual magnitudes are taken from the 2mass  database ( typically between 0.01 and 0.03 mag ) , or are 0.025 mag in the case of the carter system following the estimate in carter & meadows ( 1995 ) .",
    "linear least - square fits show that the significance of the derived slopes is less than 1@xmath26 in @xmath27 and about 1.5@xmath26 in @xmath10 , indicating that there is at present no indication of a colour term in the transformation from the 2mass  to the carter system .",
    "the average off - sets are @xmath10(carter ) @xmath28 @xmath10(2mass ) = + 0.017 @xmath3 0.008 , @xmath29(carter ) @xmath28 @xmath29(2mass ) = @xmath30 @xmath3 0.009 and @xmath21(carter ) @xmath28 @xmath21(2mass ) = + 0.048 @xmath3 0.007 ( internal errors ) .",
    "the dispersion in all three plots is about 0.03 mag .",
    "this analysis indicates ( a ) that there might be small off - sets between the two infrared systems , and ( b ) that the absolute photometric calibration of both is uncertain at the 0.01 - 0.02 mag level .",
    "this issue may addressed in more detail when the 2mass  survey has been completed and this analysis may be repeated using a larger number of stars .    regarding the same issue , nikolaev & weinberg ( 2000 ) note that the 2masssystem is similar to the cit / ctio system ( elias et al .",
    "1982 , persson et al . 1998 ) except for the @xmath31 band .",
    "they note that the difference of the absolute value of @xmath32 is less than 0.05 mag .",
    "in this section the spatial structure of the mcs is being investigated in terms of the usual approximation of a flat disk , using the largest possible dataset , that is the ogle  sample ( without the correlation with 2mass ) .",
    "the secondary aim is to correct for any depth effects in order to obtain tighter @xmath5-relations .",
    "cepheids have previously been used to determine the spatial structure of the mcs , for example caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) whose model for the lmc is a plane of insignificant thickness inclined by 29 @xmath3 6with the closest part at position angle ( p.a . ) 52 @xmath3 8 . for the smc",
    "they find that a planar model is barely sufficient to describe this galaxy , and derive an inclination of 70 @xmath3 3with the closest part at p.a .",
    "58 @xmath3 10 .",
    "laney & stobie ( 1986a ) reach similar conclusions and derive @xmath33 for the lmc with the nearest part at p.a .",
    "55 @xmath3 17 .",
    "values for inclination and position angle derived from other methods and a more general discussion can be found in the monograph by westerlund ( 1997 ) .",
    "most recently , weinberg & nikolaev ( 2000 ) used star counts from the 2mass  survey of the lmc , and a model for the number density of stars , to derive inclinations between 24 and 28 degrees , and position angles of the line - of - nodes between 169 and 173 degrees depending on the population , and an inclination of 42.3 @xmath3 7.2  from carbon - rich long period variables ( lpvs ) .",
    "the coordinate transformations that are necessary have conveniently been written down in appendix a.1 in weinberg & nikolaev ( 2000 ) .",
    "to summarise , for every cepheid under consideration one knows its right ascension and declination , and one can derive its distance @xmath34 ( see below ) .",
    "this coordinate system ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath34 ) is transformed into a rectangular coordinate system ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , which has its origin at the center ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) of the lmc or smc , the @xmath39-axis towards the observer , the @xmath37-axis anti - parallel to the right ascension axis , and @xmath38 parallel to the declination axis .",
    "another rectangular coordinate system is introduced ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , which is rotated about the @xmath39-axis by an angle @xmath46 counterclockwise ( counting east of north ) , and about the new @xmath43-axis ( the line - of - nodes ) by the inclination angle @xmath47 clockwise ( that is rotation from the new @xmath48-axis towards the @xmath49-axis ) .",
    "note that there seem to exist slightly different definitions in the literature regarding this issue , related to , for example , the definition of negative / positive inclination , the result of laney & stobie ( 1986a ) implies @xmath50 , and that of weinberg & nikolaev ( 2000 ) implies a p.a . of the line - of - nodes between 259 and 263 degrees for the lmc . ] .",
    "the above procedure assumes one knows the distance to the center of the galaxy , and the distance to the individual cepheids . to this end",
    "an observed @xmath5-relation is used , together with a typical distance ( the assumed value for @xmath42 is arbitrary because one basically look at residuals in magnitude space relative to the observed mean @xmath5-relation .",
    "however , for convenience , it is preferred here to work in physical , rather than magnitude , space , and therefore an arbitrary mean distance to the center of the galaxy has to be adopted ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath5-relation using the reddening - free wesenheit - index using the @xmath12 and @xmath13 colours is being used as the reference @xmath5-relation .",
    "this is done as the observed scatter in this relation is less than in the @xmath5-relations in @xmath12 or @xmath13 , and because the wesenheit - index , by construction , does not depend on the assumed value for @xmath16 .",
    "it depends only on the reddening law .",
    "its definition is @xmath6 = @xmath51 for the ogle  filter system and the extinction law by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ( udalski et al . 1999a ; hereafter u99a )      u99a derived the zero point and slope of the @xmath5-relation in @xmath6 , for periods longer than about 2.5 days and fundamental pulsators ( fu ) , and applying clipping at the 2.5@xmath26 level ( see table  1 , entry 1 ) .",
    "they used this cut - off in period as in the smc there is a change of slope at shorter periods ( bauer et al .",
    "1999 ) . using the same criteria i derive almost identical results ( solution 2 ) , altough i would prefer to use a less stringent clipping to have a larger sample .",
    "a solution with clipping at the @xmath52 level is also included ( solution 3 ) .    the change of slope observed in the eros data for the smc was not observed in the lmc ( bauer et al .",
    "1999 ) , and also theoretically , one would expect this change of slope to occur at shorter periods for higher metallicity ( alibert et al . 1999 ) .",
    "table  1 also includes a fit using no constraint on the period ( solution 4 ) .",
    "the results are nearly identical , but obtained for a larger sample .",
    "u99a only briefly mention the result for the slope derived for first overtone ( fo ) pulsators , and , in fact , more details are given on the ogle  homepage ( entry 5 in table  1 ) , which has been derived for stars with @xmath53 ( udalsky , private communication ) .",
    "i find essentially the same result ( solution 6 ) , also using a less stringent 4@xmath26 clipping ( solution 7 ) .",
    "however , for consistency , a cut - off at @xmath54 for fu pulsators should correspond to a cut - off at about @xmath55 for fo pulsators , according the usual ratio of @xmath56 ( for example feast & catchpole 1997 ) .",
    "table  1 gives the solutions for stars above and below this cut - off in period ( solutions 8 , 9 ) .",
    "the slopes are nearly identical , but there is a significant off - set in zero point .",
    "bauer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a smaller sample of 113 fo lmc cepheids detected by eros found that both zero point and slope did not depend on a cut - off in period .",
    "however their error bars are roughly 4 times larger than here , and so their sample may not have been large enough to detect this effect .",

    "<S> only 173 have a counterpart in the denis  survey within an 1  radius and good - photometry in all three bands . the reason for this difference </S>",
    "<S> is that the limiting magnitudes of the 2masssurvey are considerably fainter than for the denis  survey .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard stars of the carter ir photometric system are also correlated with the 2mass  survey to derive transformation equations from the natural 2mass  system to the carter - system .    in order to describe to first order the geometrical configuration of the mcs a plane </S>",

    "<S> is derived in good agreement with previous determinations . </S>",
    "<S> these results are being used to take out the effect that some cepheids  are closer to the observer than others . for the lmc </S>",
    "<S> this effect is small over the area covered by the ogle  survey , but for the smc @xmath5-relations with a reduced scatter are derived in this way . nevertheless , the dispersion in the @xmath5-relation in @xmath6 for the smc is larger than that for the lmc , indicating a significant intrinsic depth of the smc of about 14 kpc ( front - to - back ) . </S>",
    "<S> the depth of the lmc is found to be small compared to the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5-relation .    using single - epoch 2mass  data for the ogle  </S>",
    "<S> cepheids @xmath5-relations are fitted in @xmath7 ( on the carter system ) for both fundamental mode ( fu ) and first - overtone ( fo ) pulsators , taking out the effect of the inclined disk . because of the large number of stars available , this results in the most accurately determined slopes in the infrared up to now , and slopes for fo pulsators derived for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> this provides additional constraints for theoretical models .    </S>",
    "<S> the 16 derived @xmath5-relations ( in @xmath8 for fu and fo pulsators for lmc and smc ) are used to derive a relative distance modulus @xmath9 assuming no metallicity correction . </S>",
    "<S> two recent theoretical models predict different metallicity corrections , indicating a systematic uncertainty of up to 0.1 mag .    </S>",
    "<S> using the database of galactic cepheids  observed with hipparcos  and the method outlined in groenewegen & oudmaijer ( 2000 ) , the zero points of galactic @xmath5-relations for fu pulsators in @xmath6 and @xmath10 are derived , using the newly derived slopes for lmc and smc pulsators .    combining the zero points of the galactic and mcs @xmath5-relations distance moduli of 18.60 @xmath3 0.11 ( based on @xmath6 ) and 18.55 @xmath3 0.17 ( based on @xmath10 ) to the lmc , and of 19.11 @xmath3 0.11 ( @xmath6 ) and 19.04 @xmath3 0.17 ( @xmath10 ) to the smc are derived ( without taking into account possible metallicity corrections ) . </S>"
