    "we will focus in this article on applications in volcanology , where the maximal dimension of the volcano to probe is typically at the kilometer scale .",
    "this is for instance the case of la soufrire de guadeloupe in the lesser antilles or the top craters of mount etna in sicily , italy ( lesparre et al .",

    "the detectors used in the measurements are set on the slopes of the volcano and their orientation is such that they may catch muons incident from the `` open '' sky , ie not crossing the volcano , and muons which propagated through the volcano .",
    "given the position of the detector and the harsh environmental conditions , the instrument may be designed as robust as possible and totally autonomous ( remote control , low power consumption compatible with solar panels or wind wings power sources ) . despite these constrains the figure of merit of those detectors is the signal - to - noise ratio to reach the best possible sensitivity .",
    "in particular recent applications aimed at detecting small - density constrasts , which translates in small variations in the muons flux to be detected , and put severe constraints on the sensitivity ( nagamine 2003 ; lesparre et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "muons `` telescopes '' are standard high energy physics trackers that count the particles arriving from a given direction during a known time slot ( typically one month for the present applications ) .",
    "different detection techniques are used world - wide and our telescopes are scintillator xy hodoscopes , readout by multi - anodes photomultiplier tubes ( mapmt ) and self - triggered electronics , with three active planes . a picture of one telescope deployed on the slopes of the soufrire de guadeloupe is displayed on fig .",
    "[ telescopepicture ] .",
    "the coincidence and majority logics within those three planes enable to pratically eliminate the random coincidences and to reduce the contamination from particles bundles when combined with track selection filters .",
    "the basic timing resolution step used in these telescopes is set by the master clock frequency of 20mhz which is then multiplied locally by a factor 5 via a pll . therefore a 10ns timing resolution was used in the first version of the telescopes to perform event timestamping and coincidence logic between the three active planes .",
    "although sufficient to perform standard structural imaging , this timing resolution was shown to be quite limited for more sensitive studies and should have been upgraded to reach the sub - nanosecond domain .",
    "in particular we showed in the early data taking on mount etna and on la soufrire of guadeloupe ( lesparre et al .",
    "2012b , jourde et al .",
    "2013 ) that muons propagating downwards , from below the horizontal plane , and passing through the telescope may mimic muons that would have crossed the volcano .",
    "indeed in both cases the telescopes were located on the steep flanks of the volcanoes and their rear - side was facing large and deep valleys allowing even low energy particles to reach and cross the telescope . the only way to remove this noise it to use high - resolution _ tof _ criterion and therefore improve the timing resolution by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "is described the daq and timing system of the telescopes . in the second section",
    "the general features of the tdc implementation in the fpga are detailed . in the third section we present the calibration procedure and the corrections obtained on the measured flux when the backward contribution is subtracted .",
    "each detection plane is read out by its own ethernet - capable autonomous electronics and sends its data after pre - processing to a central , low - power consumption , rugged computer for the global event building and track selection .",
    "the computer ( ref.mmi-4087ad-r2a18320 from kep , 1.8ghz processor running under linux ) is hosted in a compact and isolated `` electronics box '' .",

    "+ the daq system , common to the opera and to the muons telescopes , has been designed on the concept of the so - called  smart sensors \" in which each detecting element is readout by an independant micro - processor board and sends its data over a standard ethernet network ( marteau 2010 ) .",
    "the daq system fulfills the requirements of triggerless operation , event timestamping ( with 10ns steps ) locked on external clock for off - line correlation , continuous running capability , high availability and low deadtime , modular and flexible hardware / software architecture ( trigger schemes , on - line and off - line filters etc ) .      the muons energy loss in a scintillator strip ( pla - dalmau et al .",

    "it is a @xmath42-over-@xmath3 design for which @xmath43 combinations are accessible for each oscillator , and @xmath44 for the tdc . following the calibration procedures described in the previous sections ,",
    "the tdc resolution has been measured for all possible combinations of a given implementation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : adj2 ] , right ) .",
    "a wide range of resolution is obtained from  100ps down to  20ps , with the advantadge of reproducibility which is ensured by the implementation techniques described in the previous sections .",
    "this adjustable tdc technique is being published ( girerd 2013 ) .      as demonstrated in muon tomography data analysis",
    "applied to volcanology , a good timing resolution is mandatory for background rejection and signal - to - noise ratio improvement .",
    "for instance the rejection of the upward - going muons whose trajectories might be confounded with those of downward - going muons crossing the volcano is absolutely necessary to measure the density of the structure under study .",
    "this background rejection is based on a time - of - flight analysis . since the typical size of the instrument is of the order of 1 meter , the time - of - flight of a relativistic muon amounts to some nanoseconds .",
    "this imposes severe constraints to the riming resolution of the detector which has limited ressources on field in terms of available power and embedded electronics .",
    "+ in this article we describe the implementation of fine - resolution ring oscillators tdc inside existing fpga .",
    "a simple vernier technique between two oscillators with close frequencies leads to timing resolution down to a tens of pico - seconds .",
    "the generic daq and clock distribution systems are also detailed .",
    "the implementation of the oscillators and the freezing of their routing before the general synthesis is outlined .",
    "+ the implementation on the instrument was performed remotely , while the instrument was on site .",
    "we show that simple calibrations may be achieved on site , with the instrument running , without connecting any specific test setup .",
    "the use of a common reference clock , already available for synchronization purposes , allows to measure separately one of the two frequencies and the vernier step ( i.e. the tdc timing resolution ) .",
    "+ the technique has been validated on the slopes of la soufrire de guadeloupe in the lesser antilles and a dedicated commissioning run has been organized to check the presence of upward - going muons by time - of - flight analysis .",
    "the results obtained , published separately and summarized in the present article , clearly show the presence of this upward - going muons flux and the rejection power of the tdc data .",
