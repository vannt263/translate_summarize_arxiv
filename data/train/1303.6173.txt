    "on top of the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments , a series of recent oscillation experiments , t2k@xcite , minos@xcite , double chooz@xcite , daya bay@xcite , and reno@xcite , have firmly established a framework of neutrino oscillations among three flavor neutrinos mixed with three mass eigenstates through a unitary matrix . according to the 3@xmath3 global analysis@xcite , the @xmath4 ranges of the physical oscillation parameters are given as in the following : @xmath5 and @xmath6 for normal(inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "while all the three mixing angles are now known to be different from zero , the values of cp violating phases are completely unknown yet .",
    "although there are a number of global analysis which presented the values of masses and mixing parameters consistent with among themselves @xcite , we focus on @xmath0 and its relatives obtained by reno and daya bay .    in spite of the confirmation of three flavors of neutrinos",
    ", we do not concretely exclude the existence of new kinds of neutrinos . according to the lep experimental result for invisible @xmath7 boson decay @xcite ,",
    "if there exist new types of neutrinos with mass below 45 gev , they should be sterile neutrinos which are singlet fields under the su(2 ) weak interaction . although sterile neutrinos do not interact with the electroweak gauge bosons , they can mix with three active neutrinos , leading to the oscillation between active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "inactive singlet neutrinos are familiar in utilizing the see - saw mechanism @xcite , but they are untouchably heavy . on the other hand , the existence of light sterile neutrinos with masses about @xmath8 ev or less has not been phenomenologically ruled out . it is naturally considered that their existence may affect cosmology such as big bang nuclearosynthesis , cosmic microwave background , hubble constant and galaxy power spectrum etc .",
    "many literatures have studied the impact of sterile neutrinos on cosmology and obtained some constraints on the effective numbers of light neutrino species and on the sum of light neutrino masses which may favor the existence of sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the anomalies observed in the lsnd @xcite , miniboone @xcite , gallium solar neutrino experiments @xcite and some reactor experiments @xcite , over the past several years , also can partly be reconciled by the oscillations between active and sterile neutrinos , if more than one kind of sterile neutrino are heavier than three active neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we examine whether the oscillation between a sterile neutrino and active neutrinos is plausible , especially by interpreting the results released from daya bay and reno . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that one type of sterile neutrino is added into the contents of neutrinos .",
    "the analysis is restricted within a narrow range of @xmath9 , since the setups of two experiments are optimized for @xmath10 .",
    "the search for @xmath9 oscillation with a sterile neutrino is possible only if the order of @xmath9 is not far different from the order of @xmath10 .",
    "there is no hope to probe a sterile neutrino in kilometer - baseline reactor neutrino oscillations such as reno and daya bay , if the mass squared difference between the sterile and active neutrinos is not less than @xmath11 .",
    "thus , our study does not necessarily cover the sterile neutrinos introduced to reconcile the anomalies observed in the short baseline experiments .",
    "in fact , efforts to search sterile neutrinos are being made with all types of oscillations with different baselines @xcite .",
    "there is a work that tried to probe sterile neutrino parameters with recent reactor neutrino experiments @xcite , where a different range of @xmath9 is focused on , compared with this work .",
    "this article is organized in the following outline : in section ii , the survival probability of electron antineutrinos is presented in four - neutrino oscillation scheme .",
    "we exhibit the dependence of the oscillating aspects on the order of @xmath9 , when the reactor neutrinos with the energy range 1 to 8 mev are detected after a travel along km - order baseline . in section iii ,",
    "the rate - only analysis results announced by reno and daya bay are re - analyzed in version of four - neutrino oscillation , and the relevant spectral shape analysis follows in the next section . in section iv ,",
    "the curves of four - neutrino oscillation are compared with the data obtained at the experiments in order to search for any clue for a sterile neutrino and in order to see the change in @xmath12 in the coexistence with the sterile neutrinos .",
    "broad ranges of @xmath9 and @xmath13 remain not being excluded .",
    "the exclusion bounds of @xmath13 and the best fit of @xmath12 are summarized in conclusion .",
    "the three - neutrino transformation from mass basis to flavor basis is given in terms of three angles and a dirac phase @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the rotation of the i - j block by the angle @xmath16 .",
    "when a 3 + 1 model is assumed as the minimal extension , the unitary transformation from the mass basis of @xmath17 to the flavor basis @xmath18 is given in terms of six angles and three dirac phases : @xmath19 the 4-by-4 @xmath20 is expressed as    @xmath21    where the pmns type of 3-by-3 matrix @xmath22 with three rows , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is imbedded .",
    "the cp phases @xmath25 and @xmath26 introduced in eq.([4by4trans ] ) are omitted for simplicity , since they do not affect the electron antineutrino survival probability at the reactor neutrino oscillation .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath27 produced from inverse beta decay is @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the mass - squared difference @xmath30 . in the limit",
    "where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are much smaller than one , the survival probability of @xmath27 is determined by the following three terms ( as long as @xmath33 is much larger than the others ) : @xmath34 the oscillation pattern of @xmath35 as @xmath36 increases in a logarithmic way is described in fig.[fig1:distance ] , where three patterns of oscillating probabilities are shown according to the order of @xmath9 .",
    "it is shown that the order of @xmath9 to probe a 4th neutrino must be not much larger than that of @xmath10 , since both reno and daya bay have baselines optimized for @xmath10 .",
    "the first bump in each curve corresponds to the oscillation due to @xmath9 , while the second bump that appears near @xmath37 corresponds to the oscillation due to @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath9 is much less than @xmath38 , the amplitude of the @xmath9 oscillation can appear only in the superposition with the @xmath10 oscillation .",
    "the bound on @xmath9 at which the two types of bumps can separate is about @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath40 , the oscillating aspect of the far - to - near ratio becomes unclear .",
    "hereafter , we consider the mass of the sterile neutrino @xmath33 within @xmath41 .",
    "the six baselines of the near detector(nd ) and the far detector(fd ) of reno are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , while their flux - weighted averages @xmath44 and @xmath45 are 407.3 m and 1443 m , respectively .",
    "the baselines of daya bay , named eh1 , eh2 , and eh3 , have lengths of eh1=494 m , eh2=554 m , and eh3=1628 m , so that , conventionally , eh1 and eh2 are regarded as near detectors while eh3 is regarded as a far detector .",
    "since the energy of the reactor neutrinos falls mostly in the range of 2 mev to 8 mev , the typical @xmath36 for reactor neutrino oscillation experiments like reno and daya bay is estimated to be between 60 km / mev and 270 km / mev for the nd , and between 180 km / mev and 800 km / mev for the fd .",
    "the coverage of the detectors of reno and daya bay is described in fig.[fig1:distance ] .",
    "the rate - only analysis of neutrino oscillation takes the average over accessible energies of the neutrinos emerging from the reactors .",
    "the measured probability of survival is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total cross section of inverse beta decay(ibd ) , and @xmath48 is the neutrino flux distribution from the reactor . for reno , the survival probability @xmath49 in eq.([avg_prob ] ) at each detector is evaluated as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , based on the relative distances .",
    "each @xmath52 or @xmath53 is given as @xmath35 in eq.([pee ] ) .",
    "the total cross section of ibd is given as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the flux distribution @xmath48 from the 4 isotopes @xmath56 at the reactors is expressed by the following exponential of a 5th order polynomials of @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are obtained by fitting the total flux of the four isotopes with the fission ratio expected at the middle of the burn up period of the reactors @xcite . including the product of @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ avg_prob ] ) results in average probability curve @xmath63 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : theta13theta14 ] . when @xmath64 ( as announced by reno ) , @xmath65 curve is consistent with the released result .    on the other hand ,",
    "the probability at daya bay is evaluated by three groups of six reactors , eh1(ad1 & ad2 ) , eh2(ad3 ) , and eh3(ad1 , ad2 , & ad3 ) , which catch neutrinos from three groups of reactors , d1 & d2 , l1 & l2 , and l3 & l4 .",
    "the survival probability at each detector from different reactors is evaluated as follows : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the probabilities at the i - th group of detectors due to reactors , d1 & d2 , l1 & l2 , and l3 & l4 , respectively .",
    "the coefficients are determined according to the relative distances .",
    "substituting @xmath71 into @xmath72 in eq.([avg_prob ] ) gives the survival probability at near detectors .",
    "likewise , substituting @xmath73 into @xmath72 gives the probability at the far detectors .",
    "although the flux distribution at daya bay should have been obtained independently , @xmath62 for reno in eq.([flux ] ) was included in the integration and , fortunately , the @xmath65 plot appears consistent with the published curve for @xmath74 from daya bay , as shown in the inset of fig.[fig : theta13theta14 ] .    in",
    "rate - only analysis , the value of @xmath75 is determined by obtaining the curve of @xmath63 in eq.([avg_prob ] ) which can match the measured ratios @xmath76s of the observed to expected flux at each detector .",
    "however , there is a technical difference in the definition of the expected flux using reno s approach compared to daya bay s . the definition of @xmath76 that each experiment used is discussed in details in the next section .",
    "the main figures in fig.[fig : theta13theta14 ] interpret the measurements of the far - to - near ratio in terms of a four - neutrino oscillation .",
    "two shaded bands in each frame indicate the ratios of the measured to expected at nd and fd , where the expected flux is an estimation of the flux expected without neutrino oscillation .",
    "the two bands in the plane of @xmath75 and @xmath77 for the reno experiment have ratios of @xmath78 at fd and @xmath79 at nd .",
    "the intersection indicates the combination of @xmath75 and @xmath77 allowed by the error bars in the inset .",
    "meanwhile , the two bands for the daya bay experiment showed ratios of @xmath80 at fd and @xmath81 at nd ; likewise , the intersection indicates the allowed combination of the two angles by the error bars in the inset .",
    "depending on the existence of the 4th neutrino and the magnitude of @xmath13 , the value of @xmath12 might have a different value from that previously determined , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta13theta14 ] .",
    "such a combination of @xmath75 and @xmath77 will be examined more carefully within spectral shape analysis .",
    "one of the reno s first results was the ratio of the observed to the expected number of antineutrinos in the far detector , @xmath82 ( see ref.@xcite ) , where the observed is simply the number of events at fd .",
    "on the other hand , the expected number of events at fd can be obtained through several adjustments of the number of events at nd , i.e. , @xmath83}{[\\mathrm{expected ~at ~fd } ] } \\label{obs2exp}\\\\       & \\equiv & \\frac{[\\mathrm{no .",
    "~of ~events ~at ~fd}]}{[\\mathrm{no .",
    "~of ~events ~at ~nd}]^ * } ~ , \\label{far_to_near }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the number of events at each detector is normalized .",
    "the normalization of the neutrino fluxes at nd and fd requires an adjustment between the two individual detectors which includes corrections due to daq live time , detection efficiency , background rate , and the distance to each detector .",
    "the numbers of events at fd and nd in eq.([far_to_near ] ) have already been normalized by these correction factors , and so we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 as shown in fig.[fig : theta13theta14 ] .",
    "the normalization guarantees @xmath86 at the center of reactors .",
    "reno gets rid of the oscillation effect at nd when evaluating the expected number of events at fd by dividing the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ far_to_near ] ) by 0.989 which is taken from @xmath87 .",
    "now , @xmath88}{[\\mathrm{no .",

    "thus , @xmath76 coincides with the @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta13theta14 ] .    in spectral shape analysis ,",
    "however , the denominator can not be neglected , since the oscillation effect at nd differs depending on the neutrino energy .",

    "they are described by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is given in eq.([pee ] ) .",
