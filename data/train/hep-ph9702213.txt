    "as discussed in the seminal work of jaffe and and mende@xcite there are circumstances where the constituent nature of a meson is of great importance and an effective theory ( especially using dispersion relations ) is awkward at best .",
    "these authors point out that although confinement does not allow the anomalous threshold singularity to be present , the space - like form factor does not differ significantly from the unconfined case in the weak confinement limit .",
    "finally ( for our purposes ) they show that singularities related to this _ would be _ anomalous threshold reappear much farther into the time - like sector of the form factor in the form of poles of oscillating residues .",
    "although the analysis of jaffe and mende is substantially accurate , it introduces several major approximations .",
    "for one thing it is inherently nonrelativistic . the lack of relativistic kinematics not only distorts the nature of the time - like singularities but there is also no way to relate their positions to cross channel thresholds . in addition , although their assumed wavefunction is plausible , it is not actually a solution to the schrdinger equation with a known eigenvalue .",
    "a precise analysis of singularity positions can not be made without knowledge of the energy eigenvalue .",
    "another area in which clarification is needed is the confinement potential .",
    "jaffe and mende@xcite assumed a potential which flattens to a constant at large separation , reflecting the onset of string breaking .",
    "there is on the contrary considerable evidence that the confinement potential continues to rise far beyond the string breaking length .",
    "the principal reason is the existence of linear regge trajectories which most clearly arise from light quarks moving in a linear confinement potential@xcite .",
    "the present work features a succession of exact analytic solutions of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the meson states we consider are thus of the heavy - light type . in each case",
    "we use the wavefunction and _ light _ degrees of freedom energy to analytically compute the heavy - light form factor ( or isgur - wise function ) in space and time - like sectors .",
    "the singularity structure is easily determined in each case .",
    "we first briefly review in section 2 the relativistic form factor expression , the generalized klein - gordon equation , and the anomalous threshold singularity . a sequence of solutions",
    "are then found and the appropriate form factors are computed .",
    "we begin in section  3 with the spinless relativistic hydrogen atom .",
    "the resulting isgur - wise form factor for an unconfined meson has a singularity exactly were one would expect the anomalous threshold singularity . in section  4",
    "we consider a massless quark moving in a scalar confinement potential .",
    "the isgur - wise ( iw ) form factor in this case has an essential singularity at the cross channel meson pair threshold .",
    "this singularity arises from the confinement of the constituents above and not from any _ would be _ anomalous singularity which is clearly not present in this case .",
    "a general solution with linear confinement , massive quark , and coulomb interaction is established in section  5 . the special case",
    "in which a massive , but still light , quark moves in a coulomb field and pure linear scalar confinement potential is then discussed in section  6 . here",

    "the slope at the zero recoil point is @xmath63 as the coulomb constant goes to zero ( @xmath60 ) the slope becomes infinite as previously discussed .",
    "of course a real meson is confined and since the constituent masses can never be on shell there can not be an anomalous threshold singularity of this type . as pointed out by several authors@xcite , a weakly confined meson should be very similar to an unconfined meson in most respects .",

    "the presence of an essential singularity at @xmath21 was inferred several years ago from perturbative hqet@xcite . in this case",
    "the essential singularity is associated with multiple gluon exchanges between comoving heavy quarks .",
