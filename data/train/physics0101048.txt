    "for three - body systems the faddeev equations are the fundamental equations .",
    "after one iteration they possess connected kernels , consequently they are effectively fredholm integral equations of second kind .",
    "thus the fredholm alternative applies : at certain energy either the homogeneous or the inhomogeneous equations have solutions .",
    "three - body bound states correspond to the solutions of the homogeneous faddeev equations at real energies , resonances , as usual in quantum mechanics , are related to their complex - energy solutions .    the faddeev equations were derived for short - range interactions and if we simply plug - in a coulomb - like potential they become singular .",
    "the necessary modifications have been formulated in the faddeev - merkuriev theory @xcite on a mathematically sound and elegant way via integral equations with connected ( compact ) kernels and configuration space differential equations with asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "recently , one of us has developed a novel method for treating the three - body coulomb problem via solving the set of faddeev - noble and lippmann - schwinger integral equations in coulomb  sturmian - space representation .",
    "the method was elaborated first for bound - state problems @xcite with repulsive coulomb plus nuclear potential , then it was extended for calculating @xmath2 scattering at energies below the breakup threshold @xcite . also atomic bound - state problems with attractive coulomb interactions",
    "were considered @xcite . in these calculations",
    "an excellent agreement with the results of other well established methods were found and the efficiency and the accuracy of the method were demonstrated .",
    "more recently we have extended the method for calculating resonances in three - body systems with short - range plus repulsive coulomb interactions by solving the faddeev - noble integral equations @xcite .",
    "here we solve the faddeev - merkuriev integral equations . this way we can handle all kind of coulomb - like potentials , not only repulsive but also attractive ones . for illustrating the power of this method we show our previous three-@xmath0 results and , as novel feature",
    ", we calculate resonances in the @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) system .",
    "the hamiltonian of a three - body coulombic system reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the three - body kinetic energy operator , @xmath6 stands for the possible three - body potential and @xmath7 denotes the coulomb - like interaction in the subsystem @xmath0 .",
    "we use throughout the usual configuration - space jacobi coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 . thus @xmath7 only depends on @xmath8 ( @xmath10 ) , while @xmath6 depends on both @xmath8 and @xmath9 coordinates ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the physical role of a coulomb - like potential is twofold .",
    "its long - distance part modifies the asymptotic motion , while its short - range part strongly correlates the two - body subsystems .",
    "merkuriev proposed to split the potentials into short - range and long - range parts in the three - body configuration space via a cut - off function @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . \\label{potm}\\ ] ] the function @xmath15 is defined such that it separates the asymptotic two - body sector @xmath16 from the rest of the three - body configuration space . on the region of @xmath16",
    "the splitting function @xmath15 asymptotically tends to @xmath17 and on the complementary asymptotic region of the configuration space it tends to @xmath18 .",
    "rigorously , @xmath16 is defined as a part of the three - body configuration space where the condition @xmath19 is satisfied .",
    "so , in @xmath16 the short - range part @xmath20 coincides with the original coulomb - like potential @xmath7 and in the complementary region vanishes , whereas the opposite holds true for @xmath21 .",
    "note that for repulsive coulomb interactions one can also adopt noble s approach @xcite , where the splitting is performed in the two - body configuration space .",
    "this approach can be considered as the @xmath22 limit of merkuriev s splitting .",
    "then @xmath21 coincides with the whole coulomb interaction and @xmath20 with the short - range nuclear potential .    in the faddeev procedure we split the wave function into three components @xmath23 here",
    "@xmath24 is the resolvent of the long - ranged hamiltonian @xmath25 @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the complex energy parameter .",
    "the wave - function components satisfy the homogeneous faddeev - merkuriev integral equations @xmath28 for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the resolvent of the channel long - ranged hamiltonian @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "merkuriev has proved that eqs .",
    "( [ fn - eq ] ) possess compact kernels for positive @xmath33 energies , and this property remains valid also for complex energies @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we solve these integral equations by using the coulomb  sturmian separable expansion approach .",
    "the coulomb - sturmian ( cs ) functions are defined by @xmath36^{1/2 } ( 2br)^{l+1 } \\exp(-b r ) l_n^{2l+1}(2b r ) ,   \\label{basisr}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 and @xmath38 being the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively , and @xmath39 is the size parameter of the basis .",
    "the cs functions @xmath40 form a biorthonormal discrete basis in the radial two - body hilbert space ; the biorthogonal partner defined by @xmath41 . since the three - body hilbert space is a direct product of two - body hilbert spaces an appropriate basis can be defined as the angular momentum coupled direct product of the two - body bases ( the possible other quantum numbers are implicitly assumed ) @xmath42 with this basis the completeness relation takes the form @xmath43 note that in the three - body hilbert space , three equivalent bases belonging to fragmentation @xmath0 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are possible .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a novel approximation scheme has been proposed to the faddeev - type integral equations @xmath46 i.e.  the short - range potential @xmath20 in the three - body hilbert space is taken to have a separable form , viz .",
    "@xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the validity of the approximation relies on the square integrable property of the term @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "thus this approximation is justified also for complex energies as long as this property remains valid . in eq .",
    "( [ sepfe ] ) the ket and bra states are defined for different fragmentation , depending on the environment of the potential operators in the equations .",
    "now , with this approximation , the solution of the homogeneous faddeev - merkuriev equations turns into solution of matrix equations for the component vector @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "a unique solution exists if and only if @xmath54^{-1 } - \\underline{v}^{(s ) } \\ } = 0.\\ ] ]    the green s operator @xmath55 is a solution of the auxiliary three - body problem with the hamiltonian @xmath56 . to determine it uniquely one should start again from faddeev - type integral equations , which does not seem to lead any further , or from the triad of lippmann - schwinger equations @xcite .",
    "the triad of lippmann - schwinger equations , although they do not possess compact kernels , also define the solution in an unique way .",
    "they are , in fact , related to the adjoint representation of the faddeev operator @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath57 , however , has a peculiar property that it supports bound state only in the subsystem @xmath0 , and thus it has only one kind of asymptotic channel , the @xmath0 channel .",
    "for such a system one single lippmann - schwinger equation is sufficient for an unique solution @xcite .",
    "the appropriate equation takes the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the resolvent of the channel - distorted long - range hamiltonian , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the auxiliary potential @xmath62 depends on the coordinate @xmath9 and has the asymptotic form @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , @xmath62 is an effective coulomb interaction between the center of mass of the subsystem @xmath0 ( with charge @xmath65 ) and the third particle ( with charge @xmath66 ) .",
    "its role is to compensate the coulomb tail of the potentials @xmath67 in @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to realize that in this approach to get the solution only the matrix elements @xmath68 are needed , i.e. only the representation of the green s operator on a compact subset of the hilbert space are required .",
    "so , although eq .",
    "( [ lsgc ] ) does not possess a compact kernel on the whole three - body hilbert space its matrix form is effectively a compact equation on the subspace spanned by finite number of cs functions .",
    "thus we can perform an approximation , similar to eq .",
    "( [ sepfe ] ) , on the potential @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ lsgc ] ) , with bases of the same fragmentation @xmath0 applied on both sides of the operator .",
    "now the integral equation reduces to an analogous set of linear algebraic equation with the operators replaced by their matrix representations .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath70^{-1 } = [ \\underline{\\widetilde{g}}_\\alpha ( z)]^{-1 } - \\underline{u}^{\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    the most crucial point in this procedure is the calculation of the matrix elements @xmath71 , since the potential matrix elements @xmath72 and @xmath73 can always be calculated numerically by making use of the transformation of jacobi coordinates . the green s operator @xmath59 is a resolvent of the sum of two commuting hamiltonians , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which act in different two - body hilbert spaces .",
    "thus , using the convolution theorem the three - body green s operator @xmath59 equates to a convolution integral of two - body green s operators , i.e. @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the contour @xmath80 should be taken counterclockwise around the continuous spectrum of @xmath81 so that @xmath82 is analytic in the domain encircled by @xmath80 .    to examine the structure of the integrand",
    "let us shift the spectrum of @xmath82 by taking @xmath83 with positive @xmath84 . by doing so ,",
    "the two spectra become well separated and the spectrum of @xmath85 can be encircled .",
    "next the contour @xmath80 is deformed analytically in such a way that the upper part descends to the unphysical riemann sheet of @xmath85 , while the lower part of @xmath80 can be detoured away from the cut [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] .",
    "the contour still encircles the branch cut singularity of @xmath85 , but in the @xmath86 limit it now avoids the singularities of @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , by continuing to negative values of @xmath84 , in order that we can calculate resonances , the branch cut and pole singularities of @xmath87 move onto the second riemann sheet of @xmath85 and , at the same time , the branch cut of @xmath85 moves onto the second riemann sheet of @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the mathematical conditions for the contour integral representation of @xmath88 in eq .  ( [ contourint ] ) can be fulfilled also for complex energies with negative imaginary part . in this respect",
    "there is only a gradual difference between the bound- and resonant - state calculations .",
    "now , the matrix elements @xmath89 can be cast in the form @xmath90 where the corresponding cs matrix elements of the two - body green s operators in the integrand are known analytically for all complex energies @xcite , and thus the convolution integral can be performed also in practice .",
    "to show the power of this method we examine the convergence of the results for three - body resonant - state energies .",
    "for this purpose we take first the same model that has been presented by us before in ref .",
    "this is an ali  bodmer - type model for the charged three-@xmath0 system interacting via @xmath91-wave short - range interaction . to improve its properties",
    "we add a phenomenological three - body potential . adopting noble s splitting we have @xmath92 with @xmath93 mev , @xmath94 mev , @xmath95 fm , @xmath96 fm , and @xmath97 we use units such that @xmath98 mev , @xmath99 mev fm .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0-particle is chosen as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 denotes the mass of the nucleon .",
    "the three body potential is taken to have gaussian form @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 mev and @xmath105 fm .",
    "here @xmath106 stands for the position vector of @xmath107-th particle in the center of mass frame of the three-@xmath0 system . since we consider here three identical particles we can reduce the necessary faddeev components to one .",
    "we select states with total angular momentum @xmath108 . in table 1",
    "we show the convergence of the energy of the ground state and of the first resonant state with respect to @xmath109 , the number of cs functions employed in the expansion .",
    "the selected resonance is the experimentally well - known sharp state which has a great relevance in nuclear synthesis .      in this system",
    "all the two - body interactions are of pure coulomb type , two of them are attractive , therefore we have to use the genuine merkuriev approach . since the two electrons are identical particles we can reduce the number of faddeev components to two .",
    "furthermore , we can define the cutoff function such that @xmath110 . in this case",
    "the corresponding faddeev component vanishes identically .",
    "so , finally we have to deal with one faddeev component only . in the @xmath111 subsystem",
    "we take the merkuriev s cut with the functional form @xmath112 and with the actual parameters are @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "2 and 3 show the short and long range parts of @xmath116 , respectively . in table 2",
    "we present the convergence of the energy of a @xmath108 resonant state with respect to @xmath109 and the number of angular momentum channels used in the bipolar expansion .",
    "in this article we have presented a new method for calculating resonances in three - body coulombic systems .",
    "the homogeneous faddeev - merkuriev integral equations were solved for complex energies . for this , being an integral equation approach , no boundary conditions are needed .",
    "we solve the integral equations by using the coulomb - sturmian separable expansion technique .",
    "the method works equally for three - body systems with repulsive and attractive coulomb interactions .",
