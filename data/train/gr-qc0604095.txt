    "a specific model of nonlinear electrodynamics was proposed by born and infeld in 1934 @xcite founded on a principle of finiteness , namely , that a satisfactory theory should avoid physical quantities becoming infinite .",
    "the born - infeld model was inspired mainly to remedy the fact that the standard picture of a point particle possesses an infinite self - energy , and consisted on placing an upper limit on the electric field strength and considering a finite electron radius .",
    "later , plebaski presented other examples of nonlinear electrodynamic lagrangians @xcite , and showed that the born - infeld theory satisfies physically acceptable requirements .",
    "a further discussion of these properties can be found in ref .",
    "furthermore , a recent revival of nonlinear electrodynamics has been verified , mainly due to the fact that these theories appear as effective theories at different levels of string / m - theory , in particular , in d@xmath3branes and supersymmetric extensions , and non - abelian generalizations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "much interest in nonlinear electrodynamic theories has also been aroused in applications to cosmological models , in particular , in explaining the inflationary epoch and the late accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . in this cosmological context , an inhomogeneous and anisotropic nonsingular model for the universe , with a born - infeld field",
    "was studied @xcite , the effects produced by nonlinear electrodynamics in spacetimes conformal to bianchi metrics were further analyzed @xcite , and geodesically complete bianchi spaces were also found @xcite .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions governed by the non - abelian born - infeld lagrangian @xcite , and anisotropic cosmological spacetimes , in the presence of a positive cosmological constant @xcite , were also extensively analyzed .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to note that the first _ exact _",
    "regular black hole solution in general relativity was found within nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite , where the source is a nonlinear electrodynamic field satisfying the weak energy condition , and the maxwell field is reproduced in the weak limit .",
    "it was also shown that general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics leads to regular magnetic black holes and monopoles @xcite , and regular electrically charged structures , possessing a regular de sitter center @xcite , and the respective stability of these solutions was further explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative model to black holes was proposed , in particular , the gravastar picture @xcite , where there is an effective phase transition at or near where the event horizon is expected to form , and the interior is replaced by a de sitter condensate .",
    "the gravastar model has no singularity at the origin and no event horizon , as its rigid surface is located at a radius slightly greater than the schwarzschild radius . in this context",
    ", a gravastar model within nonlinear electrodynamics , where the interior de sitter solution is substituted with a born - infeld lagrangian , was also found .",
    "this solution was denoted as a born - infeld phantom gravastar @xcite .",
    "relatively to wormhole spacetimes @xcite , an important and intriguing challenge is the quest to find a realistic matter source that will support these exotic geometries .",
    "the latter are supported by _ exotic matter _ , involving a stress energy tensor that violates the null energy condition ( nec ) , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the stress - energy tensor and @xmath6 any null vector .",
    "several candidates have been proposed in the literature , for instance , to cite a few , null energy condition violating massless conformally coupled scalar fields supporting self - consistent classical wormholes @xcite ; the extension of the morris - thorne wormhole with the inclusion of a cosmological constant @xcite ; and more recently , the theoretical realization that wormholes may be supported by exotic cosmic fluids , responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe , such as phantom energy @xcite and the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that an effective wormhole geometry for an electromagnetic wave can appear as a result of the nonlinear character of the field @xcite .",
    "in ref @xcite , evolving @xmath0 and @xmath1dimensional wormhole spacetimes , conformally related to the respective static geometries , within the context of nonlinear electrodynamics were also explored .",
    "it was found that for the specific @xmath1dimensional spacetime , the einstein field equation imposes a contracting wormhole solution and the obedience of the weak energy condition .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of an electric field , the latter presents a singularity at the throat .",
    "however , a regular solution was found for a pure magnetic field .",
    "for the @xmath2dimensional case , it was also found that the physical fields are singular at the throat .",
    "thus , taking into account the principle of finiteness , that a satisfactory theory should avoid physical quantities becoming infinite , one may rule out evolving @xmath1dimensional wormhole solutions , in the presence of an electric field , and the @xmath2dimensional case coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics .    in this work",
    "we shall be interested in exploring the possibility that nonlinear electrodynamics may support static , spherically symmetric and stationary , axisymmetric traversable wormhole geometries .",

    "we further consider the @xmath2dimensional case , which proves to be extremely interesting , as the principle of finiteness is imposed , in order to obtain regular physical fields at the throat .",
