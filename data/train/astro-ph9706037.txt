    "during the past decade , the photometric and spectroscopic surveys have allowed to improve our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution . since the 1980 s , the new technology based on ccd detectors has improved the photometric efficiency ( sensitivity , linearity , high dynamic range , ... ) as compared to photographic plates .",
    "although the photographic plates are un - rivaled in their ability to cover large areas of the sky , the large improvements brought by digital surveys , both in the photometric accuracy and in the faint limiting magnitude which can be reached , have allowed important new insight into the properties and the evolution of the different galaxy populations .",
    "several deep digital surveys ( tyson 1988 , lilly et al .",

    "first , these surveys show that the number - counts of galaxies at b @xmath11 22 are in excess with respect to a non - evolving model and the disagreement increases with the apparent magnitude .",
    "second , the galaxy colour distributions become significantly bluer at fainter magnitudes . +",
    "several models have been elaborated based on the cosmological parameters ( h@xmath12 , q@xmath12 ) and the luminosity function parameters ( @xmath13 ) allowing a good fit to the photometric data ( see koo kron 1992 for a review ) .",
    "models with pure luminosity evolution where @xmath14 evolves with look - back time ( bruzual 1983 , guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1990 , yoshii & takahara 1988 ) predict that the tail of the redshift distribution of very faint galaxies should be extended towards high redshifts .",
    "this is not observed in the recent redshift surveys to @xmath15 24 ( colless et al .",
    "1990 , 1993 , cowie et al .",
    "1991 , lilly et al .",
    "1991 , tresse et al . 1994 and glazebrook et al .",
    "1995a ) , which are in good agreement with the redshift distribution expected for a non - evolving model .",
    "models with number - density evolution ( rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 , broadhurst et al . 1992 ) are based on a population of dwarf galaxies at z@xmath2 0.3 which would have merged into brighter galaxies by z@xmath110 . however , these models are difficult to reconcile with both the recent observations of weak clustering in the correlation function of faint galaxies ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1991 and roche et al .",
    "1993 ) and with the physical mechanisms for merging ( ostriker 1990 , dalcanton 1993 ) .",
    "the most recent models use a new estimation of the slope @xmath16 of the local luminosity function ( koo et al .",
    "1993 , driver et al .",
    "1994 ) which is assumed to increase from @xmath17 to @xmath18 by the presence of a large number of dwarf galaxies ( di , de ) .",
    "this model is supported by the recent observations of the medium deep survey with the hst to i=22 ( glazebrook et al .",
    "1994b ) , where the counts of morphologically normal galaxies are well fitted by a non - evolving model and where a large excess of irregular and peculiar galaxies is detected which could contribute to the excess of blue galaxies .",
    "faint photometric and spectroscopic surveys also provide maps of the distribution of galaxies in three dimensions .",
    "the nearby surveys show that galaxies are distributed within sharp walls delineating voids with diameters between 20 and 50@xmath19 mpc ( de lapparent et al .",
    "1986 , geller & huchra 1989 , da costa et al .",
    "1994 ) ( where @xmath20 = 100 @xmath21 ) .",
    "very deep pencil beam surveys were obtained in particular directions of the sky ( broadhurst et al .",

    "1994 and glazebrook et al .",
    "1995a ) , and in some of these an apparent periodicity on scales of @xmath2 128@xmath19 mpc has been detected ( broadhurst et al . 1990 ) . at these depths",
    "( z @xmath11 0.3@xmath60.5 ) , the large amount of time required to obtain the redshift distribution for a complete magnitude - limited sample constrains observations to narrow solid angles .",
    "although the existing deep pencil - beam probes are adequate for establishing the evolutionary history of galaxies , biases caused by sparse sampling may affect the data when used to study the large scale structures ( de lapparent et al .",
    "1991 , ramella et al .",
    "1992 ) .    in this context ,",
    "a deep redshift survey near the southern galactic pole was started with the main goal to characterize the large - scale structure at large distances ( de lapparent et al .",
    "the spectroscopic survey covers a continuous solid angle of 0.3 deg@xmath10 and contains @xmath2 700 galaxies with r @xmath9 20.5 ( i.e. b @xmath9 22 ) .",
    "the median redshift is at z @xmath11 0.3 .",
    "the entry photometric catalogue for the redshift survey was obtained by observing in the b , v , r photometric bands up to 24.5 , 24.0 , 23.5 respectively in a longer strip of 0.4 deg@xmath10 ( this area was not fully covered by spectroscopic observations ) .",
    "the photometric data provide an adequate sample for measuring with high confidence level the galaxy number counts and the distribution of galaxy colours .",
    "the description of the spectroscopic sample of the eso - sculptor survey is given in bellanger et al .",
    "( 1995a ) and the first results about the properties of the large - scale structure are shown in bellanger & de lapparent ( 1995b ) .    here",
    "we describe in detail the procedures used in the reduction and analysis of the photometric sample .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the photometric observations .",
    "sections 3 and 4 outline the data reduction procedures and analyses . in sections 5 , 6 and 7",
    "we discuss the transformation into astronomical coordinates , the photometric calibration of fields and the magnitude transformations into the johnson - cousins standard system . in section 8",
    "we present the method used to match the photometry over the whole survey in each band . in section 9",
    "we show the first results on the star colour distributions , the galaxy colours and the galaxy number - counts .",
    "finally , in section 10 we summarize the major steps of our photometry and we present the scientific perspectives for the near future .",
    "this survey was performed in the context of an eso - key programme , thus guaranteeing the necessary observing time to perform the full programme .",
    "the observations began in 1989 at the 3.60 m telescope and were transferred to the ntt-3.5 m in 1991 . at a pace of two observing runs per year ,",
    "the full time allocation was consumed by the fall 1995 .",
    "the observing strategy is designed to make optimal use of telescope time . the great advantage of the multi - mode instruments used ( emmi at the ntt , dodorico 1990 , dekker et al .",
    "1991 , and efosc at the 3.6 m , buzzoni et al .",
    "1984 ) is the possibility to switch between spectroscopic and photometric observations during the course of the same night , using the same instrument .",
    "it allows one to adapt to variable weather conditions : when the conditions are photometric with good seeing quality , priority is given to imaging ; if the weather degrades , one can switch to the spectroscopic mode by simple rotation of two wheels placing an aperture mask and a grism into the optical path . because the number of observing nights is spread over many runs , the imaging data of a given run can be reduced in preparation for the subsequent run , thus yielding finding charts of the galaxies with @xmath22 to be observed spectroscopically .",
    "+ during each run , we observe our main survey region in first priority , and two auxiliary regions at the beginning and end of the night when the airmass for the main survey is large . here",
    "we only report on the data for the main survey region .",
    "the data in the auxiliary fields will be used as control samples . the position , galactic latitude and solid angle of the main field are given in table 1 . in this region of the sky , we acquired 25 - 30 frames in each of the b , v , r bands with the 3.6 m telescope .",
    "these data cover the right ascension range @xmath23 , and correspond to an area of @xmath24 . with the ntt telescope , we acquired 20 - 25 frames with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . the @xmath27 width in declination",

    "( 1991 ) in both the slope and the amplitude of the logarithmic number counts in the red band but a small shift in the blue band exists as we will see below in the discussion of the colour distributions ( section 9.2.2 ) .",
    "the r number counts of our survey are significantly higher ( @xmath33 ) than those from tyson in the common range of magnitudes",
    ". this difference has been interpreted by tyson ( 1988 ) as being due to the a priori choice of fields devoid of bright galaxies , and metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 ) suggest that this difference can originate from the use of isophotal magnitudes by tyson ( 1988 ) in contrast to the `` total '' magnitudes used by the others authors .",
    "the data of driver et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also show a small deficit in galaxy number counts compared to ours at the @xmath34 level .",
    "driver specifies that the hitchhiker data suffers from a calibration uncertainty , so a small shift in zero - point could explain the deficit in the three visible bands but this effect does not alter the slopes of the counts .",
    "in the data from smail et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the plotted points correspond to the average of two single fields .",
    "their v counts are in very good agreement with ours but their r counts show a significant number excess by a factor of about 1.2 compared with all the others authors below r@xmath8 24 .",
    "+ finally we compare our deep counts with the recent bright galaxy counts in b and r bands performed by bertin & dennefeld ( 1996 ) .",
    "these counts are in good agreement with ours and we use them to normalize the non - evolving model kindly provided by m. fioc .",
    "bertin et dennefeld ( 1996 ) suggest : @xmath35 in the b band ( estimated at b@xmath36 ) , @xmath37 in r band and we adopt an intermediate value of @xmath38 in the v band ( @xmath39 is defined by @xmath40 ) .",
    "the other parameters of the luminosity function come from guiderdoni and rocca - volmerange ( 1990 ) : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .      in this section ,",
    "we present the first results of the colour distributions for our galaxy catalogue in the b , v and r bands . as shown in fig .",
    "[ complb ] , there is a large fraction of objects identified in all 3 filters for b@xmath8 24 ( @xmath2 95 % of objects ) . in the following , we restrict the sample to these 7500 common objects . + in fig .",

    "dispersion of the colour histogram within the corresponding magnitude bin .",
    "this envelope is larger in b@xmath6r than in b@xmath6v and v@xmath6r because the expected colour in b@xmath6r varies in a large range for the different galaxy types .",
    "the b@xmath6r and b@xmath6v colours clearly show a tendency to become bluer at fainter magnitude as first observed by kron ( 1980 ) and subsequently confirmed by several groups ( tyson 1988 , metcalfe et al .",

    "+ at v @xmath9 21.5 , the typical mean colour is b@xmath6r @xmath2 1.55 and a blueing shift to b@xmath6r @xmath2 1.0 is seen between 22 @xmath8 v @xmath8 24 .",
    "the same tendency is visible in the b@xmath6v colour distribution .",

    "note that in fig .",
    "[ coulgalb ] , at b @xmath44 24 mag , the completeness level drops to @xmath2 60% ( see fig .",
    "[ complb ] ) and the mean colours ( b@xmath6r ) and ( b@xmath6v ) become redder due to the incompleteness in the r and v bands where only the brighter objects are identified and contribute to shift the colour toward redder colours .",
    "+ in contrast , the ( v@xmath6r ) colour in fig .",
    "[ coulgalb ] -  [ coulgalr ] shows no evidence of colour evolution with magnitude up to v @xmath9 24 .",
    "the same stability is obtained by driver et al . (",

    "( 1991,1995 ) and our mean v@xmath6r colours with those of smail et al .",
    "metcalfe et al s b@xmath6r colours are systematically 0.1 mag redder than ours .",
    "half of this shift is expected due to reddening in the fields of metcalfe et al ( metcalfe 1995 ) .",
    "comparison with the v@xmath6r colours of smail also show a small offset , but the restricted overlap in the magnitude ranges covered does not allow us to draw any firm conclusions about the agreement between the datasets .",
    "we have obtained ccd photometry for 9500 , 12150 , 13000 galaxies in the b , v , r ( johnson - cousins ) filters to limiting magnitudes of 24.5 , 24.0 , 23.5 respectively over an area of 0.4 deg@xmath10 near the southern galactic pole .",
    "automatic procedures were designed in order to reduce the data in an homogeneous fashion .",
    "the main steps used in obtaining the photometric catalogue are summarized as follows : + i ) we have applied the standard pre - reduction techniques of bias subtraction , flat - fielding by median filtering and cosmic - ray removal .",
    "+ ii ) because different ccds were used over the course of the programme , a large set of colour equations and zero - points were measured in order to provide reliable calibrations for the survey .",

    "+ iii ) the survey data is a mosaic of @xmath11 50 ccd frames in each band which have @xmath2 1 arcmin overlaps .",
    "we could therefore perform an internal and global readjustment of the zero - point of each ccd over the whole survey . in this way , we reduce the zero - point field - to - field scatter from @xmath2 0.11 mag to @xmath2 0.04 mag , in agreement with the photometric uncertainty estimated using simulated images ( 0.05@xmath4 for r @xmath9 22 and 0.2@xmath4 at fainter magnitudes ) .",
    "we therefore reduce the internal dispersion in our photometry to the intrinsic dispersion resulting from the limitations of the photometric package .",
    "+ iv ) accurate astrometry is performed for each ccd frame .",
    "the positional accuracy is 0.1@xmath45 for objects with r@xmath9 22 and increases to 0.3@xmath45 at fainter magnitudes , as estimated from objects located in the overlapping edges of the ccds .",
    "+ v ) measurement of the object colours is performed by matching the astronomical coordinates in each band with a tolerance of 1.2@xmath45 in position offset .",
    "the colour completeness with respect to the b band ( fraction of b objects with r and v counterparts ) is greater than 95% up to @xmath46 and drops to 60% at 24.5 .",
    "the colour uncertainties are estimated as the corresponding quadratic sum of the errors in the photometric magnitudes ( @xmath470.07 for r@xmath9 22 and @xmath470.28 for r@xmath32 22 ) .",
    "+ vi ) the star - galaxy separation is performed using a neural network and is expected to be close to a 95% success rate for r @xmath9 22 .",
    "we use the r band for the star / galaxy separation because it is our deeper band , it was observed with the best seeing conditions , and it is used for the spectroscopic selection . at r@xmath32 22 ,",
    "no separation is done due to the small fraction of faint stars expected ( @xmath2 4% ) at the high galactic latitude of the survey ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the first results from the large photometric catalogue show that : + i ) the galaxy counts in apparent magnitude and their slopes in logarithmic scale are in good agreement with previous ccd and photographic surveys and show an excess in all 3 bands with respect to the non - evolving models .",
    "+ ii ) the ( b@xmath6v ) and ( b@xmath6r ) median galaxy colours show a blueing shift of @xmath20.5 mag from b @xmath2 22 to b @xmath224.5 .",

    "+ iv ) two peaks in the stellar distributions are present in good agreement with the robin & crz ( 1986 ) model of the galactic disk and halo .",
    "+ the next step in the study of this photometric sample is the analysis of the angular correlation function @xmath49 at faint magnitude ( arnouts & de lapparent 1996 )",
    ". this work will provide information about the galaxy clustering up to faint magnitudes over a wide range of scales .",
    "the high completeness rate in colour should also allow to further characterize the properties of the faint blue galaxies . + together with the photometric data , the redshift survey of @xmath2 700 galaxies with r @xmath9 20.5 will provide a multi - colour optical luminosity function in the redshift range 0.1 @xmath50 0.5 .",
    "altogether , these data will allow us to address the issue of the evolution of galaxies with b @xmath9 22 .",
    "the photometric and redshift catalogues will also be complemented by a spectral classification of all galaxies with r@xmath920.5 ( galaz & de lapparent 1996 ) and will thus provide an unique database for studying the variations in the galaxy properties as a fonction of environment and redshift .",

    "<S> the catalog contains about 9500 , 12150 , 13000 galaxies in b , v , r bands respectively and is the first large digital multi - colour photometric catalog at this depth . </S>",
    "<S> this photometric survey also provides the entry catalog for a fully - sampled redshift survey of @xmath2 700 galaxies with @xmath3 ( bellanger et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1995a ) . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper , we describe the photometric observations and the steps used in the data reduction . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of objects and the star - galaxy separation with a neural network are performed using sextractor , a new photometric software developed by e. bertin ( 1996 ) . by application of sextractor to simulated frames and comparison of multiple measurements </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that the photometric accuracy of our catalog is @xmath2 0.05@xmath4 for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we use a method to obtain a homogeneous photometric scale over the whole survey using the overlapping regions of neighbouring ccds . </S>",
    "<S> the differential galaxy number counts in b , v , r are in good agreement with previously published ccd studies and confirm the evidence for significant evolution at faint magnitudes as compared to a standard non evolving model ( by factors 3.6 , 2.6 , 2.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy colour distributions b@xmath6r , b@xmath6v of our sample show a blueing trend of @xmath7 between 21 @xmath8 r @xmath8 23.5 in contrast to the v@xmath6r colour distribution where no significant evolution is observed . </S>"
