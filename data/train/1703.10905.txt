    "since a long time it has been established that multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) are a fundamental piece in the investigation on hadron - hadron collisions at the lhc . in these kind of events , more than one parton of a hadron",
    "interact with partons of the other colliding hadron .",
    "however , the mpi contribution to the total cross section is suppressed with respect to the single partonic interaction .",
    "nevertheless , mpi could represent a background for the search of new physic at the lhc and the measurement of their cross sections is an important experimental challenge . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "one of the main interests on mpi is the possibility of accessing new fundamental information on the partonic proton structure . to this aim",
    ", we focused our attention on the double parton scattering ( dps ) , the most simple case of mpi , which can be observed , in principle , in several processes , e.g. , @xmath0 with dilepton productions and double drell - yan processes ( see , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) . at the lhc",
    ", dps has been observed some years ago @xcite and represents also a background for the higgs production in several channels .",
    "formally , the dps cross section depends on the so called double parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) , @xmath1 , which describe the joint probability of finding two partons of flavors @xmath2 with longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath3 and distance @xmath4 in the transverse plane inside the hadron , see ref .",
    "@xcite  . here",
    "@xmath5 is the renormalization scale . since for the moment",
    "being no data are available for dpdfs , they are usually approximated in experimental analyses through a fully factorized ansantz :      being @xmath7 the usual one - body parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and @xmath8 , a distribution encoding the probability of finding two partons at distance @xmath9 . the assumption ( [ app ] ) is to neglects all possible unknown double parton correlations ( dpc ) between the two interacting partons ( e.g. ref .",
    "being dpdfs non perturbative quantities in qcd , they can not be easily evaluated and constituent quark model ( cqm ) calculations could help to grasp their basic features checking if the factorized approximation is a suitable ansatz for dpdfs see refs . @xcite  .",
    "double pdfs are first of all calculated at the low hadronic scale of the model , @xmath10 , then , in order to compare the outcome with future data taken at high momentum transfer , @xmath11 , it is necessary to perform a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) evolution by using dpdf evolution equations , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", this step is fundamental to understand to what extent dpc survive at the kinematic conditions of experiments .",
    "thanks to this procedure , future data analyses of the dps processes could be guided , in principle , by model calculations .",
    "to this aim in refs .",
    "@xcite  , dpc in dpdfs have been studied at the energy scale of the experiments and the so called @xmath12 , evaluated in refs .",
    "in fact , dps cross section , in processes with final state @xmath13 , is written through the following ratio ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) :      where @xmath15 is combinatorial factor depending on the final states @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 for @xmath19 or @xmath20 for @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 is the single parton scattering cross section with final state @xmath23 .",
    "the present knowledge on dps cross sections has been condensed in the experimental extraction of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "a constant value , @xmath24 15 mb , is compatible , within errors , with data : a result obtained within the fully uncorrelated ansatz for dpdfs ( all dpc are neglected ) .",
    "@xmath12 can be calculated within cqm in order to characterize `` signals '' of dpc . in the next sections",
    "the possible dependence of @xmath12 on the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the interacting partons is presented , see refs . @xcite  .",
    "furthermore a phenomenological calculation of dps cross section for the @xmath0 same sign production , is discussed : the main outcome of this last investigation is that dpc could be accessed in the next lhc run .      in our first studies ,",
    "dpdfs have been calculated within cqm , see refs .",
    "@xcite  , and it has been shown that at the hadronic scale , dpc can not be neglected , in particular the factorization on the @xmath25 and @xmath26 dependence is never supported . furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite  , it has been demonstrated that also the factorization in the @xmath27 dependence of dpdfs , evaluated within the relativistic light - front ( lf ) approach @xcite , does not represent a good approximation for dpdfs at the hadronic scale , independently on the chosen model for the proton wave function .",
    "the pqcd evolution of model calculations of dpdfs has been investigated and addressed in ref .",
    "a deep study on the role of perturbative and non perturbative correlations on dpdfs at high energy scales has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite  . to this aim , the following ratios have been defined :          in the above expressions @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 are the single pdfs for two given partons of flavor @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 gev@xmath35 . the ratio ( [ eq : ratioab2 ] ) would be equal to one if the factorized ansatz , eq .",
    "( [ app ] ) holds .",
    "however , since in this quantity the numerator and the denominator evolve by means of different evolution equations , @xmath36 is sensitive to non perturbative correlations , encoded in the proton wave function used to calculate dpdfs and pdfs , and to the perturbative ones due to the difference in the evolution equations of dpdfs and pdfs . in order to disentangle these two different contributions , the ratios eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ratioabp ] , [ eq : ratioabnp ] ) have been introduced and calculated .",
    "in addition , the quantity eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdpdf ] ) , appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ratioabp ] , [ eq : ratioabnp ] ) , is evaluated by evolving the product of pdfs through the dpdf evolution scheme .",
    "thanks to this feature , @xmath37 is sensitive to perturbative correlations , in fact , its numerator and denominator evolve differently in pqcd but having the same input at the initial scale .",
    "on the other hand , since in @xmath38 , the numerator and denominator evolve within the same scheme , but using a different input at the initial scale , this quantity is sensitive to non perturbative correlations .",
    "an example of these ratios is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiogg&uvuv_mcs ] ( left panel ) for , e.g. , @xmath39 , being gluons the highest partonic component at lhc kinematics .",
    "in particular , here use has been made of the dpdfs discussed in ref . @xcite and obtained within the cqm described in ref .",
    "the full ratio @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratioab2 ] ) , ( dashed line ) , influenced by both perturbative ( dot - dashed line ) and non - perturbative ( continuous line ) effects , is compared with those where perturbative and non - perturbative correlations are disentangled .",
    "as one can see in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiogg&uvuv_mcs ] , for the gluon - gluon distribution such components coherently interfere .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite  , in order to show how much these conclusions do not depend on the model used , a semi factorized ansatz has been adopted in order to include non perturbative sea quarks and gluons at a given initial scale . for gluon - gluon dpdfs ,",
    "partonic correlations are still present also in the low-@xmath40 region .",
    "the strength of the correlations seems to become smaller but they are still sizable and should not be neglected .",
    "a fundamental quantity , relevant for the experimental analyses of dps is the so called effective cross section , @xmath12 whose formal expression in terms of pdfs and dpdfs , has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite  . here",
    ", @xmath12 has been evaluated at zero rapidity through the dpdfs addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite and calculated at @xmath41 gev@xmath35 for different degrees of freedoms .",
    "the range of obtained values of @xmath12 is comparable with the three old experimental extractions of @xmath12 @xcite  .",
    "moreover , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite  , if melosh rotations were neglected , the average value of @xmath12 at the hadronic scale would change by a factor 2 , making the impact of relativistic effects in @xmath12 very important .",
    "the main important result found and discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , is the strong @xmath42 dependence of @xmath12 in the valence region , a clear sign of dpc . in ref .",
    "@xcite  , @xmath12 has been studied also through dpdfs calculated within the ads / qcd correspondence @xcite  .",
    "as one can see , the mean value of @xmath12 and its @xmath40 dependence , obtained within this different model , is comparable with those found within the lf approach in ref .",
    "@xcite  . in order to emphasize this @xmath40 dependence , in fig .",
    "[ fff ] , the ratio @xmath43 , evaluated by means of the ads / qcd correspondence , has been plotted .",
    "one can see that the ratio strongly depends on @xmath26 in the valence region and longitudinal correlations can not be neglected .      in this last section the main outcomes discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite will be summarised .",
    "due to results described in the previous section , we have studied to what extent double parton correlations could be accessed at the lhc . to this aim",
    "we have considered the same sign @xmath44 pair production , a promising process for the observation of dps @xcite  .",
    "the differential dps cross section can be written as follows @xcite  :      in order to properly evaluate eq .",
    "( [ dps ] ) by means of the use of dpdfs calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite  , it is worth to notice that in this scenario the initial hadronic scale lies in the infrared region so that the dps cross section is extremely sensitive to its value .",
    "therefore , in ref .",
    "@xcite  , it has been proposed fo fix the initial scale of the model ( @xmath46 ) , used to calculate dpdfs appearing in eq .",
    "( [ dps ] ) as follows : @xmath47 we evaluated the single parton scattering cross section for @xmath44 production by using for pdfs the same lf cqm used for dpdfs of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath48 then results found are compared with those obtained by means of dynnlo code@xcite at lo within the pdf parametrization of ref .",
    "the best match is obtained for @xmath49 gev@xmath35 .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath50 gev@xmath35 as central value .",
    "furthermore , uncertainties due to higher order corrections have been taken into account into the scheme by also varying the final scale value , i.e. , @xmath51 , being @xmath52 the @xmath44 mass .",
    "details of the fiducial dps phase space adopted in the analysis are discussed in ref .",
    "in particular we found that the total @xmath44-charge summed dps cross section ( considering both @xmath53s decays into same sign muons ) , calculated by means of dpdfs @xcite  , is found to be @xmath54 =   0.69 \\pm 0.18 ( \\delta \\mu_f)^{~+0.12}_{~-0.16}(\\delta   q_0 ^ 2)$ ] .",
    "this result is consistent with those obtained by using for dpdfs the ansatz eq .",
    "( [ app ] ) with pdfs evaluated with the mstw parametrization @xcite and those obtained with dpdfs of the model described in ref .",
    "further results of this analysis are presented in terms of the muon rapidities , i.e. , @xmath55 . in particular",
    ", the dps cross section converted in per - bin number of events , for a luminosity @xmath56 , has a maximum for @xmath57 where annihilating partons share the momentum fraction in at least one scattering .",
    "as one can see in ref .",
    "@xcite  , results obtained within the lf cqm and with the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite  , are compatible within the errors .",
    "moreover , the effects of dpc have been investigated by observing the @xmath12 dependence on @xmath58 .",
    "hereafter we call such quantity , evaluated within the lf cqm , @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , for this process we found a mean value @xmath60 mb , consistently with calculations discussed in previous section .",
    "however , the most interesting result is shown in fig .",
    "[ efb ] . here ,",
    "in fact , we appreciate a clear signature of the presence of double correlations by observing the departure of @xmath59 from a constant .",
    "we therefore demonstrated that the experimental analysis of @xmath12 in bins of @xmath61 is a suitable choice for studies on dpc .",
    "we have also estimated that , with a luminosity of @xmath62 , at 68% confidence level , such a departure of @xmath12 from a constant value can be measured in the next run of the lhc .      in this contribution",
    "we have shown new results from the calculations of dpdfs evaluated within a lf relativistic quark model .",
    "in particular , by using pqcd evolution of dpdfs , we found that longitudinal correlations affect dpdfs at very high momentum transfer and in the small @xmath40 region , also for gluon - gluon distributions .",
    "moreover , due to the correct treatment of the relativity , thanks to the light - front approach , also correlations between @xmath40 and transverse position @xmath4 are found to be important and largely model independent .",
    "the study of correlation effects in @xmath12 shows that in the valence region such a quantity is not constant and depends on @xmath40 and also using the ads / qcd correspondence for the calculation of dpdfs the result is confirmed . in order to provide a detailed analysis of @xmath12 in a given process",
    ", we studied the same sign @xmath44 pair production process by calculating its cross section and @xmath12 .",
    "results we found are consistent with previous investigations and indicate that in this specific channel , correlations in dpdfs can be observed in the next run of the lhc .",
