    "this source of baryon number non - conservation also violates lepton number ( @xmath6 ) , however , it conserves baryon number minus lepton number ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the violation of baryon number by non - perturbative weak interactions is important at high temperatures in the early universe but it has negligible impact on laboratory experiments that search for baryon number violation and we neglect it in this paper . if we add massive right - handed neutrinos that have a majorana mass term and yukawa couple to the standard model left - handed neutrinos , then lepton number is violated by two units , @xmath8 , at tree - level in the standard model .",
    "motivated by grand unified theories ( gut ) there has been an ongoing search for proton decay ( and bound neutron decay ) .",
    "the limits on possible decay modes are very strong .",
    "for example , the lower limit on the partial mean lifetime for the mode @xmath9 is @xmath10 @xcite . for proton decay to occur there must be interactions that violate baryon number by one unit and lepton number by an odd number of units .",
    "@xcite for a review of proton decay in extensions of the standard model .",
    "there are models where baryon number is violated but proton ( and bound neutron ) decay does not occur .",
    "this paper is devoted to finding the simplest models of this type and discussing some of their phenomenology .",
    "we include all renormalizable interactions allowed by the @xmath11 gauge symmetry .",
    "in addition to standard model fields they have scalar fields @xmath12 that couple to quark bilinear terms or lepton bilinear terms .",
    "baryon number violation either occurs through trilinear scalar interactions of the type ( i ) @xmath13 or quartic scalar terms of the type ( ii ) @xmath14 .",
    "the cubic scalar interaction in ( i ) is similar in structure to renormalizable terms in the superpotential that give rise to baryon number violation in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "however , in our case the operator is dimension three and is in the scalar potential .",
    "assuming no right - handed neutrinos there are four models of type ( i ) where each of the @xmath15 s couples to quark bilinears and has baryon number @xmath16 .",
    "hence in this case the @xmath15 s are either color @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "there are also five models of type ( ii ) where @xmath19 is a color @xmath17 or @xmath18 with baryon number @xmath16 that couples to quark bilinears and @xmath20 is a color singlet with lepton number @xmath21 that couples to lepton bilinears .",

    ", the present absence of observed @xmath24 oscillations provides a lower limit on the scalar masses of around @xmath25 .",
    "if we consider the limit @xmath26 then for @xmath27 the next generation of @xmath28 oscillation experiments will be sensitive to @xmath29 masses at the gut scale .",
    "there are three models that have @xmath1 mixing at tree - level without proton decay . in these models ,",
    "constraints on flavor changing neutral currents and the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron make it unlikely that , if @xmath1 oscillations are observable , one of the scalar masses approaches the gut scale .    in the next section",
    "we enumerate the models and discuss their basic features .",
    "the phenomenology of one of the models is discussed in more detail in section iii .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "we are looking for the simplest models which violate baryon number but do nt induce proton decay .",
    "we do nt impose any global symmetries .",
    "hence , all local renormalizable interactions permitted by lorentz and gauge invariance are assumed to be present .",
    "we begin by considering renormalizable scalar couplings with all possible standard model fermion bilinears .",
    "a similar philosophy can be used to construct models involving proton decay @xcite or baryon number violating interactions in general @xcite .",
    "we first eliminate any scalars which produce proton decay via tree - level scalar exchange as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     and @xmath30 scalar exchange . ]     from @xmath31 scalar exchange .",
    "]    in particular , this eliminates the scalars with @xmath11 quantum numbers @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath32 we need an additional @xmath35-boson exchange to get proton decay ( fig .",
    "[ fig1c ] ) since the yukawa coupling to right - handed charge 2/3 quarks is antisymmetric . the remaining possible scalar representations and yukawa couplings are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we have assumed there are no right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath36 ) in the theory .    . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now investigate baryon number generation in model 1 .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 violating processes in cosmology have been studied in the literature in great detail ( for early works , see @xcite ) .",
    "we treat @xmath20 as much heavier than @xmath19 and use two different @xmath20 s to get a cp violating phase in the one - loop diagrams that generate the baryon asymmetry . for this calculation @xmath19",
    "is treated as stable with baryon number -2/3 as each will eventually decay via baryon number conserving processes to two antiquarks . to simplify our discussion ,",
    "let s consider the case in which the couplings satisfy the hierarchy @xmath37 .",
    "the top line of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the dominant tree - level and one - loop diagrams contributing to the baryon number violating decays of @xmath20 . rotating the @xmath15 fields to make the couplings @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath39 real we find , & & ( x_2 _ 1 _ 1 ) = + & &  , + & & ( _ 2 x_1 x_1 ) = + & &  .the net baryon number produced per @xmath40 pair is ( see , table [ table2 ] ) , @xmath41,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that @xmath42 invariance guarantees the total width of @xmath20 and @xmath43 are the same . given our choice of hierarchy for the couplings ,",
    "we have approximated the total width as coming from the tree - level decay of @xmath20 to antiquarks .",
    "a similar result in the context of @xmath44 models was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "even with just one generation of quarks , the cp violating phase can not be removed from the couplings @xmath45 , @xmath39 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and a baryon asymmetry can be generated at one loop . at first glance",
    "this is surprising since there are four fields , @xmath48 @xmath49 , @xmath19 and @xmath50 whose phases can be redefined and four relevant couplings .",
    "however , this can be understood by looking at the relevant lagrangian terms , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the problem reduces to finding solutions to the following matrix equation , (    cccc 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 + 2 & 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 + 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 +    ) (    c _ x_1 + _ x_2 + _ x_2 + _ d +    ) = (    c _ + _ + _ g_2 + _ g_2 +    )  , where the phases on the right - hand side are arbitrary .",
    "let us take the difference of the first two equations to remove phases for the couplings @xmath38 and @xmath55 , and the difference of the last two equations to remove phases for the coupling @xmath56 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "those two equations can not be simultaneously fulfilled for arbitrary @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the baryon number generated in the early universe can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ delta_n ] ) by following the usual steps ( see , for example , @xcite ) . out of equilibrium decay of @xmath20 and @xmath43 is most plausible if they are very heavy ( e.g.  @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , to get measurable @xmath64 oscillation in this case , @xmath19 would have to be light  a case that is strongly disfavored by neutron edm constraints .",
    "we have investigated a set of minimal models which violate baryon number at tree - level without inducing proton decay .",
    "we have looked in detail at the phenomenological aspects of one of these models ( model 1 ) which can have @xmath64 oscillations within the reach of future experiments .",
    "when all the mass parameters in model 1 have the same value , @xmath65 , and the magnitudes of the yukawa couplings @xmath66 and @xmath67 are unity , the present limit on @xmath1 oscillations implies that @xmath65 is greater than @xmath68 . for @xmath69 , the neutron edm and flavor constraints give @xmath70 < 6 \\times 10^{-6}$ ] , @xmath71 < 0.45 $ ] , and @xmath72 < 1.7 \\times 10^{-3}$ ] which indicates that some of the yukawa couplings and/or their phases must be small if @xmath64 oscillations are to be observed in the next generation of experiments .",
    "of course even in the standard model some of the yukawa couplings are small .",
    "there are two other models ( model 2 and model 3 ) that have @xmath1 oscillations at tree - level .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for them , although the details are different . in models 2 and 3 ,",
    "exchange of a single @xmath19 does not give rise to a one - loop edm of the neutron .",
    "however , @xmath3-@xmath73 mixing can occur from tree - level @xmath19 exchange .",
    "observable @xmath1 oscillations can occur for @xmath74 with @xmath75 at / near the gut scale .",
    "this requires @xmath76 , and flavor and electric dipole constraints require some very small yukawa couplings making this scenario unlikely .",
