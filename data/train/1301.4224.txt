    "the recent discovery of a particle which is likely to be the higgs boson  @xcite with a mass of @xmath0 concludes the quest to complete the particle spectrum of the standard model .",

    "however , the standard model itself can not explain the value of this parameter and in particular its smallness compared to the uv cutoff , @xmath11 ( which we take to be the scale of new physics in the uv where the standard model breaks down as an effective theory , _",

    "@xcite coleman and weinberg showed that in the absence of mass scales in the potential of a scalar field , a mass scale is nevertheless generated via dimensional transmutation from the running couplings , and indeed spontaneous symmetry breaking does occur .",

    "the essential feature / requirement employed here is that the _ renormalised mass _ at the origin in the field space is kept at zero , @xmath19 in dimensional regularisation , which does not introduce any explicit scale aside from the rg scale , entering the logarithmically running couplings , this equation is satisfied automatically . in other regularisation schemes such as _ e.g. _ the cutoff scheme , the zero on the right hand side of corresponds to an exact cancellation of all the quadratically divergent parts between the bare mass squared terms and the counterterms .",
    "the consequence of is that no explicit mass scales are allowed in the effective potential of the theory , except the renormalisation scale appearing in the logarithm .",
    "this is the manifestation of the scale invariance of the classical massless theory ; the scale invariance is broken only by the radiative corrections which introduce only a logarithmic scale dependence .    now returning to the effective potential in , at small values of the field",
    ", the logarithm in the brackets always wins , giving the potential a downward slope . on the other hand , at values",
    "@xmath20 the slope is always positive .",
    "accordingly we always have a minimum of the potential at a value @xmath21 . using this",
    ", one can remove the renormalisation scale @xmath18 of the potential by renormalising at the acquired vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath22 .",
    "another simplification arises from the fact that if we choose @xmath23 the value of the @xmath16-self - coupling @xmath24 squared at the minimum of the effective potential is negligible compared to the u(1 ) gauge coupling @xmath25 , as shown in eq .",
    "below , and we can drop the first term in brackets .",

    "in fact , in weakly coupled perturbation theory the vev is naturally generated at the scale which is exponentially smaller than the uv cutoff .",

    "equation is the consequence of the dimensional transmutation : the dimensionality of the vev is carried by the uv - scale landau pole , while the exponential smallness of the ratio @xmath37 is guaranteed by the perturbativity of the coupling constant @xmath36 in the vacuum _",
    "i.e. _ at the scale @xmath34 .",
    "this addresses the naturalness problem .",
    "we would also like to quantify the exponential sensitivity of the vev @xmath34 to the _ input _ ( or bare ) values of the coupling constants at the uv cutoff scale ( we continue calling it @xmath35 even though here we do nt think of it as a landau pole ) .",
    "we proceed by solving the rg equation for the ratio of coupling constants , which is obtained by combining with the rg equation for @xmath24 , @xmath38 for the ratio @xmath39 we find , @xmath40 upon integration and setting the rg scale @xmath32 and using the condition @xmath41 we obtain ( we keep only the first term on the _ r.h.s . _ of ) @xmath42 this expression shows the exponential sensitivity of the vev to the values of the couplings at the uv cutoff . as a result , the vev can easily be made exponentially smaller than the uv cutoff ( in agreement with what we have already concluded from ) .",

    "the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism generates a symmetry - breaking vev and the mass for the associated scalar from radiative corrections .",
    "these scales are natural in the sense that they are automatically exponentially suppressed compared to the uv scale at which we initialise the theory .",
    "phenomenologically , however , this scenario has a fatal flaw : if @xmath16 is the higgs , then the higgs mass turns out to be too small .",
    "this is because the @xmath16 self - coupling is much smaller than the gauge coupling @xmath47 . from eq .",
    "one can calculate the physical mass of the higgs remaining after spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry by shifting the field @xmath48 , @xmath49 in terms of the mass @xmath50 of the vector boson we have @xmath51 this is in conflict with the observation that , in the standard model , the higgs is heavier than the corresponding vector bosons .    to resolve this problem we thus need to look beyond the minimal standard model . in this paper",
    "we consider a very compact extension of the standard model where there is no longer a direct link between the higgs mass and the sm vector boson masses , and consequentially , the higgs can take its observed value @xmath52  gev .",
    "at the same time , this formulation maintains the essential feature that all mass scales are generated radiatively through breaking of classical scale invariance via running couplings .    in the section  * [ sec : two ]",
    "* we outline the minimal model we want to study : a scale - invariant standard model with an additional cw  hidden sector \" and the higgs portal - type coupling to the sm . in section  * [ phenomenology ] * we analyse the phenomenology of this model in the context of lhc and future colliders , and low energy measurements .",
    "we point out that with the higgs mass now being a known quantity , the minimal model has only two remaining free parameters , and we show that the model is perfectly viable .",
    "the presently available higgs data provide valuable constraints on the parameter space , while future experimental data on higgs decays ( as well as resonance searches ) will further constrain model parameters , and will ultimately provide discovery potential for this model .    in a pre - lhc context this simple model has already been discussed in  @xcite along with a variety of other similar scalar field models in  @xcite .",
    "first model - building implications of a @xmath53  gev higgs have also been looked at in  @xcite .",
    "the use of the coleman - weinberg mechanism for bsm model building is motivated by and based on the concept of classical scale invariance .",
    "although the scale invariance symmetry is anomalous , it has been argued in  @xcite that it may indeed be used as a model - building guide and to motivate coleman - weinberg type models  @xcite . in section  * [ sec : three ] * we provide another , renormalisation - group - inspired argument in favour of this model - building strategy .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section  * [ sec : five]*.",
    "as we have seen in the previous section the main problem of the cw scenario is that the mass of the higgs boson is too small within the sm .",
    "the reason is that the mass of the higgs is directly linked to the mass of the gauge bosons and is 1-loop suppressed compared to those .",
    "a simple way to address this issue is to generate the mass scale in a `` hidden sector '' and then transmit it to the sm , where it directly acts as the scale @xmath5 of the pure sm .",
    "this breaks the direct cw relation between the sm gauge boson masses and the mass of the sm higgs boson .    a simple model to realise this is a higgs - portal model  @xcite with the cw toy model as a hidden sector  @xcite .",
    "the classical potential for scalar fields is , @xmath54 the first and the last terms are just the ordinary self - couplings for the higgs field and @xmath16 field , while the second term is the higgs - portal , coupling the sm higgs field to the hidden sector field @xmath16 . for future convenience",
    "we chose the sign in front of this higgs - portal coupling to be negative .    to check the stability of this potential we complete the square in @xmath55",
    "the potential is then stable as long as @xmath56 when @xmath57 the two sectors decouple .    for non - vanishing",
    "@xmath58 the higgs portal interaction can generate the higgs mass parameter of via @xmath59    importantly , in eq .",
    "we have not allowed for any mass terms . in other words",
    "we have a completely scale - free potential even in presence of the higgs portal coupling .",
    "we now proceed with employing the coleman - weinberg mechanism in the higgs - portal theory where the complex scalar @xmath16 is coupled as before to a u(1)@xmath60 gauge theory ( this forms the hidden sector ) , while the higgs doublet @xmath2 has standard interactions with the su(2)@xmath61u(1 ) gauge fields ( as well as matter fields ) of the standard model . at the origin in field space , _ i.e. _ when all field vevs are zero , there are no scales present in the classical scale - invariant theory .",
    "we want to and can preserve this feature in the quantum - corrected full effective potential even after renormalisation by using vanishes by gauge invariance . ]",
    "@xmath62 this is the same subtraction scheme as in the simple case , and as there , these conditions are automatic in dimensional regularisation of any theory with classical scale invariance . in other regularisation schemes",
    "one cancels quadratic divergencies between the bare masses and the counterterms .",
    "we elaborate on this in more detail in next section .",
    "the easiest way to visualise the emergence of electroweak symmetry breaking in this theory is to consider a near decoupling limit .",
    "if @xmath63 we can essentially view the process of symmetry breaking independently in the two different sectors and we can view electroweak symmetry breaking effectively as a two step process .    in the first step the cw mechanism generates a ( large ) vev @xmath28 in the hidden sector through dimensional transmutation precisely as was outlined in the previous section . in the second step the vev @xmath28",
    "is transmitted to the standard model via the higgs portal , generating an effective mass parameter for the higgs @xmath64 equation dictates that @xmath5 fixes the electroweak scale , specifically , @xmath65 this implies that when @xmath63 and also is much smaller than other sm higgs couplings , the electroweak scale is suppressed compared to the hidden sector scale , as was anticipated , @xmath66 the fact that the generated electroweak scale is much smaller than @xmath28 guarantees that any back reaction on the hidden sector vev @xmath67 is negligible .",

    "the vector boson masses and the higgs boson mass are independent and can take their observed sm values .",
    "the exponential sensitivity of the higgs vacuum expectation value to the boundary values of the couplings , and the natural generation of the hierarchy between the ewsb scale and cut - off scale in , crucially depend on the choice of massless renormalisation conditions eq .   at the origin of the field space .",
    "in this section we want to give arguments in favour of this choice .",
    "a suitable symmetry to forbid mass terms for scalars is scale invariance .",
    "indeed , in absence of scale invariance the classical potential eq",
    ".   would allow for two additional mass terms , @xmath74    in the class of theories we consider , scale invariance is a classical symmetry which is broken by quantum corrections , specifically by the logarithmic running of the couplings .",
    "one might therefore query if it is allowed to set these mass terms to zero in full quantum theory , as we have done in eq .  .",
    "in  @xcite this question has been answered favourably based on the special role played by dimensional regularisation and considering the anomaly in the trace of the energy - momentum tensor . here",
    ", we provide additional perspective and support based on the renormalisation group , and also address the question of scheme dependence .",
    "first we want to check if our requirement that the mass terms vanish  , is affected by a change in the renormalisation scale .",
    "to do this we can look at the appropriate renormalisation group equations for the mass terms . in _ dimensional regularisation _",
    "they have the form , @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 the anomalous dimension of the higgs and @xmath16 field respectively , and @xmath78 as before .",
    "we can clearly see that @xmath79 is a fixed point of the rg evolution and , once enforced at one scale , it holds at all scales . in this sense  within dimensional regularisation  our renormalisation conditions eq .",
    "are self - consistent and contain no fine - tuning .",
    "they correspond to an enhanced unbroken symmetry for these couplings .    in the argument above we made use of a specific regularisation scheme : dimensional regularisation .",
    "in other regularisation schemes the ( one - loop ) rg equations have a different form , @xmath80 with constants @xmath81 that depend on the regularisation scheme .",
    "the terms @xmath82 destroy the fixed point at @xmath79 . instead we now have a partial , @xmath58 and @xmath24 . ] fixed point at , @xmath83    neglecting the evolution of @xmath15 , @xmath58 and @xmath24 we can now write the rg equation for @xmath84 as @xmath85 this equation has the simple solution , @xmath86=(\\epsilon_{i}-\\epsilon_{i , \\rm partial})(t_{0})\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{m}\\right)^{2-\\eta_{i}}\\ ] ] where the staring point for the trajectory is @xmath87 , so that the combination @xmath88 appearing above , is @xmath89 .",
    "we now let the trajectory run from the high scale @xmath90 to a low value of @xmath18 . at weak coupling",
    "we can neglect the anomalous dimensions . using an initial value",

    "in absence of additional mass scales in the theory we are free to make this choice .",
    "indeed one can argue that this is a preferred choice since in this case the only scale invariance breaking effect is the logarithmic running of the dimensionless couplings , which is independent of the regularisation scheme .",
    "all scheme - dependent ( and therefore unphysical ) effects are set to zero .",
    "let us take a step back from our concrete model and take a look at the more general situation .",
    "from a renormalisation group point of view , consistent theories are those that have a uv fixed point in the space of dimensionless coupling constants ( all coupling constants of higher dimensional operators can be made dimensionless by scaling with an appropriate power of the rg scale , therefore this space is very infinite dimensional ) . in order for a theory to be predictive",
    "we need to be able to describe it by a finite number of parameters . for the uv fixed point",
    "this means the following : the space of all rg trajectories ending in the fixed point as the rg scale is taken to infinity is finite dimensional .",
    "the number of these dimensions is the number of free parameters . in the usual language",
    "these are the _ relevant _ parameters . exciting",
    "a combination of coupling constants that is not in this subspace leads to an rg trajectory that ( per definition ) does not end in the fixed point as we go into the uv and the theory has incurable divergencies .",
    "the fixed point of a theory defined in this manner can be in the perturbative region where all coupling constants are small , but it can also be in a non - perturbative regime . in the latter case we have a non - perturbatively renormalisable theory in the sense of weinberg s scenario of `` asymptotic safety ''  @xcite .    to give a concrete example , consider qcd with one flavour of massive fermions .",
    "this theory has two relevant parameters that can be chosen to be non - vanishing , the gauge coupling constant @xmath94 and the mass @xmath95 divided by the rg scale @xmath18 , @xmath96 .",
    "the rg equations are @xmath97 one can easily check that starting from any ( sufficiently small ) value of @xmath94 and @xmath84 , we end up in the uv fixed point @xmath98 .",

    "e.g. _ , @xmath99 with dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath100 we have , @xmath101 which for any starting point with non - vanishing @xmath102 ( but still close enough to the fixed point ) has a trajectory that rapidly moves away from the fixed point .",
    "the same argument holds for any other higher dimensional operator .",
    "the terms on the right hand sides of eqs .",
    ", that are linear in the couplings whose change is described on the left hand sides , describe the approach to , or running away from the fixed point in the uv are the eigenvalues of the stability matrix of the system of rg equations .",
    "close to the perturbative fixed points , they are given by minus the naive dimension of the coupling plus its anomalous dimension . ]",
    ", @xmath103 clearly , those directions with negative @xmath104 , approach the fixed point @xmath105 as the rg - scale @xmath18 goes to infinity ; while those with positive @xmath104 , diverge . the case with @xmath106 leads to the usual marginal behaviour with logarithmic running towards ( or away from ) the fixed point .",
    "going in the opposite direction towards smaller @xmath18 , the operators with @xmath107 are exactly those that quickly obtain very large values .",
    "this is where the hierarchy problem lies .",
    "choosing `` natural '' @xmath108 initial values for those operators at some uv scale , we get enormous values at a smaller scale .",
    "vice versa , to get a value @xmath108 at some small scale requires us to finely tune the initial value at the high scale to be extremely small .",
    "importantly the @xmath104 are the critical exponents of the theory which are thought to be _ scheme - independent_.    our proposal is now as follows .",
    "let us restrict our theory to live on a subspace of all trajectories which end in the fixed point .",
    "this subspace is defined by only exciting the marginal @xmath106 trajectories .",
    "then _ all scales are generated via dimensional transmutation from the logarithmic running of the coupling constants .",
    "_ this is not a fine - tuning because we require the @xmath109 operators to be _ exactly zero _ , _",
    "i.e. _ we are living exactly on this well - defined subspace .",
    "our concrete example now shows that we can choose the initial value of the higgs mass operator at the high scale to be vanishing while still getting a phenomenologically viable non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( and physical higgs mass ) by dimensional transmutation from the marginal operators which exhibit only logarithmic running .",
    "the trajectories in the subspace requiring all @xmath106 , are exactly those that correspond to classical scale invariance , broken only by the logarithmic running induced by quantum corrections",
    ".    alternatively one can consider theoretical setups like supersymmetry ( susy ) where the quadratic divergences are absent .",
    "such a theory has an additional scale ( susy - breaking scale ) above which the quadratic divergencies are canceled .",
    "this scale is physical in the sense that the dynamics of the theory above this scale is qualitatively different from the behaviour in the ir .",
    "this is for example due to the appearance of new degrees of freedom at higher energies .",
    "in such a situation we get _ finite _ threshold corrections from these additional degrees of freedom in any regularisation scheme . simulating the quadratic divergencies of ordinary theories",
    ", these threshold corrections typically also scale quadratically with the scale of new physics . in the case of susy , above the susy - breaking scale quadratic divergences are canceled between bosons and fermions , leaving threshold corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "these corrections are proportional to the mass squares of the susy partners of the sm particles and therefore quadratically sensitive to the scale at which susy is broken .    even in this type of setup ,",
    "our coleman - weinberg scenario is a helpful step to bridge the ( possibly large ) gap to this scale of new physics without generating a big fine - tuning . in the more complete theory",
    "we then only need to ensure that the sum total of all the finite threshold corrections vanishes .",
    "to us this seems a more achievable goal then getting a small ( compared to the scale of new physics ) but non - vanishing sum of threshold corrections .",
    "let us investigate in this section the phenomenological viability as well as possible signatures of the proposed model .",

    "we have shown that a simple higgs - portal model allows to generate the electroweak scale via the coleman - weinberg mechanism while at the same time giving a phenomenologically viable higgs mass .",
    "the simple model we have discussed has a rich phenomenology and can be tested at the lhc .",
    "while the explicit model considered in this paper is interesting on its own right thanks to its simplicity , it can also be viewed as a representative of a whole class of models in which the coleman - weinberg mechanism generates a low scale in the hidden sector which then is transmitted to the sm via the higgs portal .    an essential requirement for the coleman - weinberg mechanism to work is that the renormalised mass at the origin of the potential vanishes .",
    "all scales are then generated from dimensional transmutation and are exponentially suppressed compared to the uv scale at which the theory is initialised .",
    "we have collected and discussed various arguments why the vanishing of the renormalised mass terms is a sensible condition .",
    "we find two main possibilities .    1 .",
    "let us take the _",
    "full _ classical theory to be massless and scale invariant .",
    "scale invariance is broken in the quantum theory .",
    "dimensional regularisation is the scheme which ( to our knowledge ) breaks scale invariance minimally . in dimensional",
    "regularisation the condition of vanishing masses at the origin is independent of the renormalisation scale and can therefore be imposed consistently without fine - tuning ( in a more general scheme a similar condition can be defined consistently ) .",
    "the radiative generation of the ewsb scale in the full theory then proceeds via the cw mechanism as described in the body of the paper .",
    "2 .   alternatively , assume that only the _ low energy theory _ we observe , has approximate scale invariance up to quantum corrections .",
    "the scale invariance breaking effects of additional high scale physics cancels exactly ( not approximately as one would require to generate a small renormalised mass scale at the origin of field space ) .",
    "the model s phenomenology is that of a higgs portal model , however with constraints imposed that arise from generating the electroweak scale via a small visible - hidden sector coupling .",
    "the modifications compared to the sm are generically small , and exclusion bounds are driven by precision investigations of the higgs boson candidate .",
    "in essence , electroweak symmetry breaking proceeds along the lines of the sm , with modifications only due to small mixing effects and total higgs width modifications .",
    "all these quantities can be determined most precisely at a future linear collider .    although our simple setup can not be considered a full solution to the hierarchy problem it provides a simple and experimentally testable scenario that may act as a first step to gain additional insight on the mechanism that generates the electroweak scale .",
