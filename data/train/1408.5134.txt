    "soft and collinear factorization formulas for infrared - safe observables in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) often involve soft functions .",
    "up to normalization , a soft function for a particular qcd observable is nothing but the expression for that observable in the soft limit .",
    "the calculation of the soft function for a given observable is typically much simpler than the analogous full qcd calculation but can nevertheless provide useful physics insights which might otherwise be cumbersome to extract analytically  @xcite .",
    "recently , due to an ever - increasing experimental demand for precise theoretical predictions , numerous higher - order soft function calculations have been carried out .",
    "most of these higher - order computations are at @xmath1 in perturbative qcd and concern observables with soft limits which are completely described by massless ( light - like ) soft wilson lines .",
    "notable examples include various soft functions for jet mass observables in @xmath2 annihilation  @xcite , the soft function for @xmath3 decay  @xcite , the transverse momentum - dependent soft function for drell - yan production  @xcite , the soft function for electroweak gauge boson production at large transverse momentum  @xcite , and the soft function for the invariant mass distribution of highly boosted @xmath4 pairs  @xcite .",
    "very recently , remarkable progress has been made towards the calculation of soft corrections at @xmath5  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "threshold predictions for both higgs and drell - yan production at hadron colliders are now available at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , much less attention has been given to higher - order soft function calculations which involve squared matrix elements of massive ( time - like ) wilson lines .",
    "in fact , only the soft function for secondary production of a massive quark - antiquark pair in @xmath0 annihilation  @xcite and the soft function for threshold production of a massive color octet at hadron colliders  @xcite have been calculated to second order in the strong coupling constant .",
    "in particular , only one - loop , next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) qcd corrections are currently available for the threshold top quark pair production soft function at hadron colliders  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the calculation of the complete two - loop , next - to - next - to - leading order  ( nnlo ) corrections to the threshold soft function for top quark pair production at hadron colliders can be carried out because it is an important ingredient for both next - to - next - to - next - to - leading threshold logarithm resummation and approximate fully differential nnlo calculations  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we take a first step towards our ultimate goal of understanding the parton - initiated processes relevant for hadron collider physics by calculating the threshold soft function for heavy quark pair production in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "the motivation for this calculation is manifold .",
    "first of all , the master integrals that we encounter during the course of our @xmath0 calculation will surely also show up when we calculate the two - loop @xmath6 soft function .",
    "furthermore , the calculation performed in this paper can and will  @xcite be used to construct a monte carlo program for the computation of fully differential nnlo qcd corrections to the continuum production of heavy quark pairs at @xmath0 colliders .",
    "so far , no similar program has appeared which furnishes fully differential nnlo predictions for continuum @xmath7 and @xmath4 production in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "finally , the structure of the result obtained is interesting in its own right because , to date , no complete two - loop , massive soft function calculation of comparable complexity has been carried out .",
    "as alluded to above , the most immediate application of our results will be to new studies of heavy quark pair production in @xmath0 annihilation at energies far above the kinematic threshold .",
    "a good understanding of such processes , both theoretically and experimentally , is of considerable interest .",
    "for instance , the bottom - quark forward - backward asymmetry at the @xmath8 peak has long been known to provide one of the most precise methods for the extraction of the electroweak mixing angle , @xmath9  @xcite . furthermore , at the proposed international linear collider , where a sustained run at a center - of - mass energy of 1 tev has been discussed , precise fully differential continuum top - quark pair production calculations will be essential in order to obtain reliable theoretical predictions for important high energy collider observables like the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "due to the presence of the heavy quark mass , higher - order perturbative qcd corrections to the process @xmath10 are difficult to calculate , even at nnlo .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that , to date , all physics predictions at nnlo have been made in some sort of approximation scheme .",
    "a number of studies of the total cross section have been carried out over the years , both at the kinematic threshold  @xcite and at extremely high energies  @xcite . for more differential observables such as the forward - backward asymmetry",
    ", the situation is similar .",
    "the heavy quark forward - backward asymmetry has been known to nnlo in the massless approximation for some time  @xcite and , more recently , the full mass dependence was worked out for the purely virtual nnlo corrections  @xcite . at the present time",
    ", no fully differential calculation , exact to second order in qcd perturbation theory , exists in the literature .",
    "the calculation of infrared - safe observables at nnlo is also complicated by the fact that , for a given observable , there are always three independent components which must be calculated and then consistently combined together ; in order to obtain a finite and physically meaningful result , one requires two - loop , purely virtual corrections , one - loop , real - virtual corrections with one additional unresolved parton in the final state , and real - real corrections with two additional unresolved partons in the final state . over the years , a number of important steps have been taken towards the computation of fully differential nnlo qcd corrections to @xmath11 observables .",
    "the two - loop , purely virtual corrections were first computed in a series of papers  @xcite and later confirmed by another group  @xcite .",
    "when at least one parton is resolved , the combination of the real - virtual and real - real corrections are given by the well - known nlo qcd corrections to @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the only ingredient missing is a framework for the consistent combination of the various components mentioned above .",
    "important progress has been made on this front by a number of authors , extending the antenna subtraction method  @xcite to deal with massive , colored , final state particles  @xcite . in the meantime ,",
    "a promising new method  @xcite has been developed which makes use of ideas from frixione - kunszt - signer subtraction  @xcite and sector decomposition  @xcite .",
    "an alternative and perhaps even more straightforward approach to such calculations is to simply extend to nnlo the phase space slicing method used in the original nlo qcd calculation of the @xmath13 process  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a variant of this approach based on dispersion relations has already been successfully applied to compute the full light quark flavor - dependent contributions at nnlo  @xcite . to fix some notation and help clarify the role played by the @xmath13 soft function",
    ", we now give a brief explanation of the method in the context of a simple example .    in the region of phase space where the energy of the qcd radiation off of the heavy quarks is small",
    ", heavy quark effective theory  @xcite implies that @xmath14 differential distributions factorize .",
    "we therefore have , for instance , the factorization formula @xmath15 relevant to the computation of the @xmath14 forward - backward asymmetry ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in the above",
    ", @xmath16 is the leading order cross section for @xmath17 production differential in the cosine of the polar angle , @xmath18 , between the beam line and the final state heavy quark , @xmath19 is ( for essentially historical reasons ) twice the energy of the soft radiation off of the @xmath17 pair , and @xmath20 is the factorization scale .",
    "the kinematical variable @xmath21 appearing in the factorization formula is defined in terms of the heavy quark mass , @xmath22 , and the center - of - mass energy , @xmath23 , as @xmath24 the hard function , @xmath25 , encodes the purely virtual corrections and the soft function , @xmath26 , encodes the soft radiative corrections at threshold . finally , the factorization formula depends on an energy scale , @xmath27 , below which the power corrections in @xmath28 become negligible and , as a result , the full differential distribution is well - approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : factformula ] ) .",
    "now , continuing with our example , the phase space slicing method would first employ factorization formula ( [ eq : factformula ] ) to calculate the differential cross section when the total energy of the soft radiation is less than or equal to @xmath27 and then employ a monte carlo calculation of @xmath12 to calculate the differential cross section for jet energies greater than or equal to @xmath27 .",
    "the idea is to obtain a result which is approximately independent of the cutoff by taking @xmath27 small enough to sufficiently suppress power corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : factformula ] ) but at the same time large enough to avoid numerical instabilities in the monte - carlo code for @xmath12 for jet energies of order @xmath27 . in a closely related context , stability with respect to variations in the cutoff parameter",
    "was demonstrated in reference @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we write down the operator definition of the @xmath29 soft function and discuss its renormalization group  ( rg ) evolution . in section  [ sec : oneloopsol ] , we exhibit the one - loop heavy quark soft function to all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter .",
    "the remainder of the third section is devoted to the technical details of our two - loop calculation , first in section [ sec : realvirtual ] for the real - virtual contributions and then in section [ sec : realreal ] for the real - real contributions . due to their length ,",
    "we chose to put our results for the real - virtual and real - real contributions to the bare two - loop soft function in ancillary files included with the arxiv submission of this paper .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that readers interested only in our final result for the renormalized two - loop soft function may skip directly from section  [ sec:2 ] to section  [ sec:4 ] without significant loss of continuity . in section  [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we begin by presenting the final result of our calculation in a concise way . in order to check",
    "that we have not made any calculational errors , we then discuss , one - by - one , all available consistency checks on the result .",
    "this naturally leads into a discussion of the light - like limit of the heavy quark soft function and our novel way of understanding it .",
    "with no additional input whatsoever , we found that we could predict the @xmath30 expansion of the bare two - loop @xmath31 or drell - yan soft function to @xmath32 by expanding our bare two - loop heavy quark soft function to @xmath33 and then making certain replacements in the resulting expressions .",
    "besides a precise statement of the connection between these two seemingly rather different bare soft functions , we discuss another , similar correspondence between bare soft functions defined using a hemisphere jet algorithm and point out that , in fact , the various relations we have observed can not follow from known factorization properties of the massive soft functions we consider . finally , a brief summary and outlook is given in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the soft function can be written as the square of a time - ordered matrix element of two semi - infinite wilson line operators , @xmath34 the soft function defined in eq .",

    "( 3 ) , twice the energy of the soft qcd radiation , @xmath19 , and the factorization scale , @xmath20 .",
    "the soft function also depends implicitly on the renormalized strong coupling constant , @xmath35 , and the number of colors , @xmath36 .",
    "the summation is over all possible soft parton final states , @xmath37 .",

    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that @xmath55 given the usual definitions @xmath56 and @xmath57 . from the above it",
    "is clear that the @xmath58 and , by virtue of the time - reversal invariance of qcd , drell - yan soft functions  @xcite can be computed from eq .",
    "( 4 ) in the @xmath59 limit .    in the perturbative regime , the soft function can be calculated order - by - order in @xmath35 .",
    "let us begin by discussing the bare soft function .",

    "we can write the loop expansion of the bare soft function as , are defined in the obvious way by setting the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 in eq .",

    "@xmath61 where the @xmath62 are coefficient functions depending on both @xmath21 and the parameter of dimensional regularization , @xmath63 .",
    "the renormalization of the soft function is most easily carried out in laplace space . as usual , the laplace transform is taken with respect to @xmath19 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the euler constant .    the bare soft function in laplace space has the simple structure @xmath67 and it requires both charge and operator renormalization .",

    "an additional operator renormalization is typically necessary whenever one studies composite field operators . in this case",
    ", the appearance of additional uv divergences is related to the fact that the product of wilson line operators in the definition of the soft function has a cusp singularity at the coordinate origin .",
    "this cusp singularity can be removed by a simple multiplicative renormalization , @xmath76 after charge renormalization has been carried out , the operator renormalization constant of the soft function is fixed at each order in the renormalized coupling by insisting that it absorb any remaining uv divergences .",

    "we also found it helpful to consider the threshold ( @xmath137 ) and high - energy ( @xmath135 ) limits of our results . in the threshold limit ,",
    "the soft function must vanish by virtue of the fact that there is no phase space for soft gluon emission when the @xmath14 pair is produced at rest . that this is indeed the case constitutes a non - trivial cross - check on our result because several of the real - virtual master integrals have coulomb - like singularities at @xmath137 . in the high - energy limit ,",

    "it is clear from the arguments given there that the @xmath162 limit of our result can be obtained from a factorization formula which involves the well - known @xmath58 soft function @xcite , the heavy quark fragmentation function @xcite , and a universal factor relating the hard function for @xmath58 to the hard function for @xmath163 in the high - energy limit  @xcite . with assistance",
    ", we were able to successfully compare the high - energy limit of our result to small-@xmath21 predictions made privately by the authors of reference @xcite .",

    "it would be very interesting to investigate this further , both at higher loops and for processes with more than two soft wilson lines .",
    "although we do not yet understand the origin of the novel relations that we have ( presumably ) discovered , we have observed that a similar relation ( with , however , @xmath183 instead of @xmath164 replaced by @xmath184 at one loop ) holds between the high - energy limit of the bare one - loop massive hemisphere soft function , @xmath185 and the bare one - loop massless hemisphere soft function  @xcite . furthermore , for the correspondence between @xmath186 and @xmath182 , we have checked that it holds for the real - virtual and real - real contributions separately , thus implying that it can not be explained by the known factorization properties of the @xmath163 soft function in the high - energy limit alone .",
    "altogether , the evidence strongly suggests that what we have observed is not accidental but , rather , hints at structure in the soft limit of qcd which remains to be properly understood .",
    "in this paper , we calculated the two - loop threshold soft function in perturbative qcd for heavy quark pair production at @xmath0 colliders .",
    "our results will form an indispensable part of any monte carlo program based on the phase space slicing method which aims to provide fully differential nnlo qcd predictions for @xmath163 observables above the kinematic threshold .",

    "in addition , the master integrals that we computed in this paper will form a subset of the master integrals required for a complete two - loop calculation of the soft function for threshold top quark pair production at hadron colliders .",
    "it would certainly be worthwhile and interesting to undertake this calculation and we hope to return to it in the near future .    while performing cross - checks on our main result , we discovered interesting relations between the epsilon expansions of bare soft functions built out of time - like wilson lines and the epsilon expansions of bare soft functions built out of light - like wilson lines .",
    "more specifically , we found that the @xmath187-th term in the epsilon expansion of the bare two - loop soft function considered in this work could be used , after first taking the light - like limit of the results , to straightforwardly write down the non - trivial part of the @xmath89-th term in the @xmath30 expansion of the bare two - loop drell - yan soft function .",
    "due to the fact that the bare drell - yan soft function has poles in @xmath30 which the bare heavy quark soft function does not , it is rather surprising that such a simple correspondence exists between them .",
    "navely , one might try to explain away the observed correspondence by relating it to the known factorization properties of the heavy quark soft function discussed in reference  @xcite .",
    "however , such an approach is bound to fail because our relations can actually be used to relate the real - virtual and the real - real contributions to the two - loop soft functions in question _ separately_. in fact , we even observed a similar but quantitatively different phenomenon for a more exclusive type of soft function where the phase space available to the soft radiation is partitioned into two hemispheres by dropping a plane perpendicular to the thrust axis at the collision point . in our opinion",
    ", the available evidence suggests that we have uncovered a new property of soft functions in perturbative qcd which demands an explanation . to this end , it would be interesting to see what happens at higher orders in perturbation theory and to investigate whether back - to - back primary kinematics is a necessary prerequisite for there to be simple relations between pairs of soft functions in the first place .",
