    "there has been much recent interest in the abundance of argon in the sun and nearby objects @xcite .",
    "the abundance of argon in the solar photosphere can not be directly derived as the temperature is much lower than that needed to excite neutral or singly - ionized ar lines , so proxies such as nearby b stars , regions , planetary nebulae , or solar system sources such as the atmosphere of jupiter must be used .",
    "it is presumed that the sun collapsed out of material that is represented by such objects , so the element abundances derived are  protosolar \" : allowance must , however , be made for a certain amount of heavy - element settling over the sun s lifetime .",
    "there are several emission lines of ar ions in the extreme - ultraviolet and x - ray spectra of the quiet or active region solar corona or solar flares , and such lines have been used to give ar abundances @xcite .",
    "commonly line flux ratios are used to obtain the ratios of abundances from spectroscopic measurements ; thus @xcite obtained argon - to - magnesium abundance ratio of @xmath3 from measurements with the _ skylab _ ultraviolet spectrometer s082a , while @xcite obtained an argon - to - calcium abundance ratio in the range @xmath4 , from both _",

    "( abundances here are expressed on a logarithmic scale with h @xmath6 by a notation extensively used in recent literature , @xmath7 . )",
    "the review by @xcite gives @xmath8 , using a revised o abundance , which updates a previous determination @xcite of 6.10 based on a single measurement from solar energetic particles .",
    "the possibility of fractionation through the  fip \" ( first ionization potential ) effect is recognized , with the abundances of elements having low fip ( @xmath9  ev ) being enhanced in the solar wind and corona by factors of @xmath10 and abundances of elements with high fip ( @xmath11  ev ) approximately the same as the proxies for the solar photosphere @xcite : ar is of interest because its fip ( 15.8  ev ) is larger than that of any other common element in the sun apart from he and ne .",
    "the high - resolution x - ray crystal spectrometer resik ( rentgenovsky spektrometr s izognutymi kristalami ; @xcite ) on board the _ coronas - f _ spacecraft has observed x - ray lines in the 3.36.1    range emitted by solar coronal plasmas .",
    "line fluxes with diagnostic potential including the possibility of deriving element abundances have already been analyzed @xcite .",
    "the instrument operated between 2002 and 2003 , and several thousand spectra were collected .",
    "it had significant improvements over previous spectrometers in that a background formed by fluorescence of the crystal material was eliminated for the two short - wavelength channels by judicious settings of the detector high - voltages and pulse height discriminators , and minimized to very small levels for the remaining two channels .",
    "the period from 2002 august to 2003 february was particularly appropriate for analysis as the settings were then fully optimized , and spectra were selected from this period for the analysis described here .",
    "here we use flux values of the resonance ( @xmath12 ) line at 3.949    ( actually the flux in the 3.944.01    interval minus the flux in a neighboring portion of continuum ) to derive the absolute abundance of ar ( ar / h ) by comparing with theoretical values taken from the chianti database and code @xcite . as",
    "the sensitivity of resik is very high , the flux measurements have good statistical quality and are a considerable improvement over those from the _ solar maximum mission _ flat crystal spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the ly-@xmath13 lines of form a single prominent feature at 3.733    in high - temperature flare spectra observed in resik channel  1 , and are also available for analysis in the same way . the observations and analysis are described in section  2 , and comparison of argon abundances from the and lines and with values obtained by other workers is described in section  3 .",
    "the spectra discussed here were obtained in channels 1 ( 3.403.80   ) and 2 ( 3.834.27 ) of the resik instrument .",
    "x - rays from the sun were diffracted by silicon crystals ( si 111 , @xmath14   ) for both these channels .",
    "resik channel  2 spectra include emission lines consisting of three features called @xmath12 ( transition @xmath15 , 3.949   ) , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , 3.969   ) , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , 3.994   ) .",
    "the line flux ratio @xmath20 is slightly temperature - dependent .",
    "the @xmath21 ratios from measured line fluxes in particular time intervals were plotted against single values of temperature and emission measure @xmath22 ( @xmath23 electron density , @xmath24 emitting volume ) estimated from the ratio of emission in the two channels of _ goes _ @xcite , and were found to be close to theoretical values based on data from chianti @xcite . although a slight improvement to the fit was obtained by taking a two - temperature - component emission measure , in this work we take the original isothermal model as more suitable for analyzing the large number of spectra available .",
    "channel  1 spectra include lines which were previously discussed @xcite and , for temperatures greater than about 10  mk , the ly-@xmath13 line feature at 3.733   .    some 2795 spectra from a sample of 20 flares between 2002 august and 2003 february",
    ", having _ goes _ importance ranging from c1 to x1 , were selected for analysis , and an average of non - flaring points taken from @xcite .",
    "the spectra were collected over integration times that were inversely related to the x - ray activity level , from 2  s at the peaks of strong flares to 5  minutes for non - flaring periods .",
    "details of the selected spectra are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "calibration factors , converting photon count rates to absolute flux units , were applied to all the spectra from post - launch analysis @xcite .",
    "the lines in channel  2 were observed in spectra over a large temperature range . as in our previous work and in flare analyses by several other authors , we derived temperature ( @xmath25 ) from the flux ratio of the two _ goes _ channels for the time period of each resik spectrum using the procedure of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ stacked_resik_ch2_sp ] ( left - hand plot ) shows all the spectra analyzed stacked vertically in order of @xmath25 . in the right - hand plot ,",
    "the spectra are normalized to the total number of photon counts , and the total spectrum shown at the top of each plot .",
    "the lines are evident over the entire temperature range shown , even at temperatures as low as 5  mk . as well as the principal lines ( 3.9493.994   ) ,",
    "the @xmath26 line ( also known as @xmath27 ) is prominent at 4.088   , as is a line feature at 4.19    made up of dielectronic satellites ( transitions @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and at higher temperatures ( @xmath32  mk ) the h - like cl ( ) ly-@xmath13 line .",
    "weak lines of with transitions @xmath33 with @xmath34 occur between 3.998    ( @xmath35 ) and 3.883    ( @xmath36 ) ",
    "wavelengths are from atomic data extending the usual database of the chianti database and code @xcite .    the ly-@xmath13 line at 3.733    falls in the range of resik channel  1 .",
    "it is emitted over a wide range of temperatures , though it is most prominent at temperatures above about 10  mk .",
    "the line is visible in channel  1 spectra already shown in @xcite in a stacked representation like figure  [ stacked_resik_ch2_sp ] .",
    "the line feature occurs at very nearly twice the wavelength of the well known group of highly ionized fe lines ( @xmath37   ) but these have no effect on the observed spectra as second - order diffraction is forbidden for si 111 crystal used in channel  1 .",
    "weak lines ( @xmath38 , 3.696   ; @xmath39 , 3.784   ) occur near the line feature , but have no effect on the measurement of the line flux .",
    "the fluxes of the @xmath12 and ly-@xmath13 lines were estimated by taking narrow wavelength intervals around the lines ( 3.944.01    for the @xmath12 line and 3.723.745    for the ly-@xmath13 line ) and subtracting a portion of nearby continuum .",
    "uncertainties in each flux measurement were taken from the uncertainties in the photon counts , assuming poissonian statistics .",
    "for the @xmath12 line , the continuum flux was invariably much less than the flux in the range containing the line , but this was not always the case for the ly-@xmath13 line .",
    "we combined the uncertainties in the line and continuum flux measurements and if this combined uncertainty for any spectrum was larger than the difference between the line and continuum flux we rejected the estimate .    to obtain estimates of the ar abundance",
    ", we used a procedure similar to the one used by @xcite for the abundance of k from lines observed in channel  1 .",
    "_ goes _ temperatures @xmath25 and emission measures @xmath40 for the time interval corresponding to each spectrum were found and the value of the flux of each line divided by @xmath40 ( units of @xmath41  @xmath42 ) was plotted against @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath12 line plot is shown in figure  [ g - of - t_arxvii ] ( left panel )",
    ". points from individual spectra are shown as black dots while averages over 1-mk temperature intervals are also shown .",
    "the much smaller scatter of points than for the corresponding plot for lines ( fig . 3 of @xcite )",
    "reflects the larger fluxes of the line . to these points",
    "are added theoretical contribution functions @xmath43 given by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 population of the excited level @xmath46 of ion ar@xmath47 , @xmath48 number density of the ion ar@xmath49 ( all levels summed ) , @xmath50 the number density of all ionization stages of ar , @xmath51 number density of hydrogen ( h ) , @xmath52 is the electron density , and @xmath53 is the transition probability from level @xmath54 to the ground state . following @xcite , @xmath55 was taken to be 0.83 , which is correct for coronal plasmas with @xmath56  k. the atomic data , taken from version 6 of chianti , include excitation rate coefficients from the ar@xmath49 ground state , taken from @xcite , based on @xmath57-matrix code calculations of ar@xmath49 up to @xmath58 levels including effects of radiation damping .",
    "@xcite estimate the uncertainties in the rate coefficients for excitation to the @xmath59 level to be @xmath60% .",
    "the ion fractions @xmath61 were taken from @xcite .",
    "we took the recent ar abundance estimates @xmath62 from both @xcite ( @xmath63 ) and @xcite ( @xmath64 ) : different line - styles show the @xmath43 curves for the two assumed abundances which are shown in figure  [ g - of - t_arxvii ] .",
    "the contribution of unresolved dielectronic satellites , which is accounted for in chianti , is included in the @xmath43 curves .",
    "a similar procedure was used for flux estimates of the ly-@xmath13 line , where again _ goes _ temperatures and emission measures were used .",
    "the resulting plot is shown in figure  [ g - of - t_arxviii_lya ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the theoretical contribution functions were also derived from chianti and include unresolved satellite lines . in this case ,",
    "excitation rate coefficients are taken from interpolation of @xmath57-matrix calculations of @xcite and @xcite for ionized he and fe .",
    "this is a rather wide strength of atomic numbers , and there are now more recent data for specifically lines @xcite but as the transitions are simple , it is thought that interpolation for the case of ( @xmath65 ) will not lead to large errors .",
    "each value of the observed line flux divided by @xmath40 gives a value for the ar abundance @xmath66 , so a number distribution can be plotted for the abundance values obtained .",
    "this is done in the right - hand panels of figures  [ g - of - t_arxvii ] and [ g - of - t_arxviii_lya ] .",
    "the derived value of @xmath67 $ ] is plotted along the horizontal axis , and the numbers of spectra with particular values of @xmath7 over intervals of 0.1 are plotted along the vertical axis . an approximately gaussian distribution is apparent for the @xmath12 line results , with the peak of the best - fit gaussian at @xmath68 and the fwhm points at 6.35 and 6.52 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 from the line fluxes is therefore @xmath69 ( uncertainty is standard deviation ) . the ly-@xmath13 line is formed at a higher temperature than the @xmath12 line , and in fact the uncertainties in the wavelength interval defining the line ( 3.723.745   ) become larger than those in the nearby continuum for @xmath70  mk .",
    "we thus took only line flux measurements for @xmath71  mk to derive the argon abundance .",
    "these estimates are shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ g - of - t_arxviii_lya ] , where as with the argon abundance estimates from the @xmath12 line an approximately gaussian distribution is obtained . the peak value @xmath72 , with fwhm points at 6.30 and 6.68 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 from the line fluxes is therefore @xmath1 .",
    "the larger uncertainty reflects the weaker flux of the ly-@xmath13 and the smaller number of flux measurements .",
    "the mean of the and values weighted by the variances is @xmath73 .",
    "there is apparently little variation from flare to flare in the derived values of @xmath7 from the or lines .",
    "this can be seen from figure  [ flare - to - flare ] ( top panel ) where the mean value of @xmath7 is plotted for each of the 20 flares here , together with a non - flaring period discussed in previous work @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is also plotted , being derived from the lines in channel  1 , as reported by @xcite , as well as the logarithm of the abundance ratio , i.e. @xmath75 . the error bars indicate the uncertainties in the mean values .",
    "the total variations are within the estimated uncertainties , and so the abundances of k and ar appear to be constant for this sample of resik flares .",
    "the non - flaring points from @xcite are consistent with the remaining flare points though the uncertainties are somewhat larger because of the weaker and line emission at lower , non - flare temperatures .",
    "possible time variations of the k and ar abundances were checked because previous results from _ solar maximum mission _ bent crystal spectrometer data indicated time - varying abundances of ca from the @xmath12 line ( 3.177   : see @xcite ) .",
    "our values of the ar abundance @xmath7 from resik @xmath12 line , @xmath69 , and from the ly-@xmath13 line , @xmath1 , are very close to each other , the small difference being much less than the uncertainties indicated by the scatter of individual points in figures  [ g - of - t_arxvii ] and [ g - of - t_arxviii_lya ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the excitation rate coefficients for the lines are , as mentioned , @xmath60% , which translates to a vertical shift of the theoretical contribution function @xmath43 by this amount .",
    "this is very small compared with the scatter of measured values , however , even for the more intense @xmath12 line .",
    "even so , a slightly better estimate might result from use of the @xmath57-matrix rate coefficients of @xcite and more particularly the rate coefficients of @xcite since they are likely to be an improvement over the interpolated values presently used in the chianti database for this ion .",
    "our abundance estimates may be compared with other published values .",
    "the estimate from resik spectra of @xcite is based on spectra from the 2002 period when the instrument characteristics were not quite optimized .",
    "in addition , a constant intensity calibration factor for each channel was taken though the more recent work of @xcite shows that there is a slight variation with wavelength . however , the value from @xcite , @xmath76 , is very close to the value obtained here ( @xmath69 ) from the @xmath12 line .",
    "our values are somewhat less ( up to 0.20 dex ) than values obtained from _ skylab _ ultraviolet lines @xcite but are very close to that obtained from _ p78 - 1 _ observations of the @xmath77 x - ray line at 3.128    @xcite .",
    "the 3.128    line used was not generally visible with the _ p78 - 1 _ spectrometer but became apparent when the instrument was slightly off - pointed ; the quality of the spectra are reasonably good and @xcite consider their estimate to be reliable .",
    "the _ smm _",
    "flat crystal spectrometer scanned through the wavelength region of the lines at 3.93    during flares on a few occasions ; the spectra , which do not have particularly good statistical quality , are discussed by @xcite . observed ratios of the @xmath12 line with the nearby @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( @xmath27 ) lines gave a value of the ar / s abundance ratio of @xmath81 , which with the coronal value of @xmath82 from @xcite leads to @xmath83 , in agreement with the values obtained in this work .",
    "the recent compilations of abundance data of @xcite and @xcite give @xmath84 and @xmath8 respectively , the chief difference being the abundance of o taken in these two works .",
    "our value from @xmath12 line flux measurements falls between these two values and agrees with both to within the stated uncertainties .",
    "some discussion on the nature of the fip effect has resulted in different conclusions about coronal and proxies for photospheric argon abundances : @xcite state that high - fip ( fip @xmath11  ev ) elements have approximately the same abundances whereas @xcite argue that the coronal abundance of high - fip elements are depleted by a factor 2 .",
    "considerably more data on argon abundances are now available since either of these publications , and are summarized by @xcite . a mean of her values of the proto - solar abundances ,",
    "i.e. those assumed to be appropriate to the solar nebula , from a variety of objects ( regions , jupiter s atmosphere , planetary nebulae , and b stars ) is @xmath85 with a scatter of about @xmath86 . following @xcite , reducing this abundance by 0.07 to allow for heavy - element settling over the sun s lifetime gives a solar photospheric abundance of 6.48 which again is in agreement with our values .",
    "this suggests that there is little or no depletion of the coronal ar abundance with respect to the photospheric , assuming that the adjusted proto - solar abundances are a reflection of the latter .",
