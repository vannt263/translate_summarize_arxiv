    "the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation provides strong evidence for the big bang model of cosmology and is the best probe we have for determining conditions in the early universe as well as determining many important cosmological parameters .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the cmb contains information on virtually all cosmological parameters of interest , including the geometry of the universe ( @xmath0 ) , the baryon density ( @xmath1 ) , the hubble expansion rate ( @xmath2 ) , the cosmological constant ( @xmath3 ) , the number of light neutrinos ( @xmath4 ) , the ionization history of the universe , and the amplitudes and spectral indices of the primordial and tensor perturbation spectra .",
    "precise cmb observations , data analysis , and interpretation can distinguish between cosmological models .",
    "they can be used to verify that the range of models under consideration is plausible and to distinguish between models with primordial perturbations ( e.g. the inflationary big bang ) or those with active perturbations ( e.g. topological defects which must result from spontaneous symmetry breaking of unified forces ) .",
    "once a model is thus singled out , its parameters can , in principle , be determined to accuracies of the order of a per cent@xcite .    since the initial detection of cmb temperature anisotropies by the _ cobe _",
    "dmr @xcite , over a dozen other balloon - borne and ground - based experiments have reported anisotropy detections on smaller angular scales . with the existence of anisotropies",
    "now firmly established , observational goals have shifted towards an accurate determination of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum over a wide range of angular scales .",
    "the reasons for this are two - fold .",
    "( 1 ) if the processes producing the initial fluctuations are stochastic and random phase , then the power spectrum contains all the information of the underlying physical model .",
    "( 2 ) it is observationally easier to obtain a power spectrum than a fully reliable map .",
    "several technical advances , including improved receivers , interferometry , and long - duration balloon flights , hold great promise for high - precision maps in the next few years .",
    "ultimately , the two approved satellites : nasa midex mission map and esa m3 mission planck are expected to provide high - angular - resolution high - sensitivity maps of the entire sky in multifrequency bands .",
    "thus we can anticipate increasingly complex data sets requiring sophisticated analysis : cobe dmr 4-year maps ( 6144 pixels ) , the cfpa balloon experiments maxima / boomerang ( 26,000 to 130,000 pixels ) , map ( @xmath5400,000 pixels ) , and planck ( @xmath6 pixels ) .",
    "these maps then hold the promise of revolutionizing cosmology in terms of making it significantly more precise in quantitative terms .",
    "it is the goal of these lectures to provide the background necessary to understand the existing data , soon to be achieved data from experiments in progress , and finally the forthcoming data from the more advanced experiments and space missions .",
    "we proceed with some historical context , a review of the cobe observations both for the discovery of anisotropy and as a prototype for the next generation of space missions , a review of the current and proposed generations of balloon - borne experiments and interferometers , and finally a discussion of the new space - based experiments .",
    "primordial nucleosynthesis calculations require a cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) with a temperature @xmath7  mev at a redshift of @xmath8 .",
    "gamow , alpher , & herman @xcite realized that this cbr was required and predicted its evolution to a faint residual relic radiation with a current temperature of a few degrees .",
    "our more modern view of the hot big bang models gives the cosmic background radiation a very central role in the development of the universe .",
    "the cmb was serendipitously discovered by penzias & wilson @xcite in 1964 ( published in 1965 ) and they noted that it was isotropic to the sensitivity of their measurement ( @xmath9% ) .",
    "the observed cmb spectrum is well characterized by a @xmath10  k blackbody spectrum .",
    "the hot big bang model predicts that the cbr should have a thermal spectrum and this is verified precisely .",
    "combined with the observed spectrum of the dipole anisotropy , this precision thermal spectrum also provides us with the knowledge and ability to separate cmb anisotropies from the various foregrounds .",
    "anisotropies will in general have a spectrum set by the derivative of the cmb spectrum .",
    "see my previous lectures for a more complete discussion of the expected anisotropy spectrum .",
    "there are three primary threads of science that are pursued by cmb anisotropy measurements :    \\(1 ) initial conditions for large scale structure formation : the formation of galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and large scale structures is a key issue in cosmology .",
    "theory indicates that whatever the seeds of structure formation , they will leave their imprint as anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "different scenarios for structure formation will leave different anisotropies .",
    "\\(2 ) physics of the early universe : cmb anisotropy measurements are a probe of the ultra - high energy physics and processes that occur in the very early universe .",
    "these observations are a probe of inflation or quantum gravity and a test of potential topological defects ( monopoles , strings , domain walls , and textures ) that must result from spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "\\(3 ) geometry and dynamics of the universe : observations of the cmb anisotropies provide information on the metric and topology of the space - time , the isotropy of expansion of space - time , the curvature of space , and the possible rotation and shear of the universe .",
    "there is now a fairly extensive literature on the first two areas and the third is what we consider classical cosmology . in the early history of the field",
    "all measurements led only to upper limits on cmb anisotropy and these in turn led to limits on but not a measurement of these processes .",
    "a major finding of the initial _ cobe _ dmr discovery @xcite was that the cmb was anisotropic on all observed angular scales . a key question is what these anisotropies represent .",
    "immediately , the interpretation focused upon the seeds of large scale structure formation . in the early 1970 s the observed large scale structure and",
    "scaling arguments led to the prediction @xcite,@xcite,@xcite that the primordial gravitational potential perturbations must have an equal @xmath11 amplitude on all scales .",
    "this corresponds to a matter density perturbation power - law spectrum , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the comoving wavenumber , with @xmath14 . at that time",
    "there were no known mechanisms for producing such a scale - invariant power spectrum of fluctuations . in 1982 it was found that inflationary models predicted nearly scale - invariant perturbations as a result of quantum mechanical fluctuations at very early times . even with the proliferation of inflationary models , it is found that essentially all reasonable inflationary models predict @xmath15 . presumably , a more reasonable class of inflationary models will result in requiring a tie to particle physics .",
    "it is now known that topological defects naturally produce scale - invariant fluctuations .",
    "thus there are at least two known mechanisms for producing a nearly scale invariant primordial perturbation spectrum .",
    "the translation from a scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations to the cmb temperature anisotropies depends upon angular scale and the contents of the universe . on large angular scales the results of most models are fairly similar . including the effects of a standard cold dark matter model ,",
    "a harrison - zeldovich @xmath14 universe is consistent with the power spectrum measured by the _",
    "cobe _ dmr data .",
    "the observed power spectrum of fluctuation amplitudes is also consistent with models of large scale structure formation based upon primordial seeds produced by quantum fluctuations or topological defects in the early universe .",
    "the physics of anisotropy caused by primordial density perturbations is usually divided into four generic areas although they are all treated properly in the full sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "these effects are : the gravitational redshift which dominates at large angular scales , the ( rees - sciama ) effect on light propagating through a changing potential , the doppler effect caused by the motion of the observer or the source , and temperature or entropy variations .",
    "models of the formation of structure in the universe fall into two broad classes : inflationary and defect models .",
    "each model predicts an angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropy described in terms of the amplitude of the spherical harmonic of multipole order @xmath16 .",
    "the most detailed theoretical work has been carried out for inflationary models .",
    "hu and white @xcite have argued that all inflationary models produce an angular power spectrum with a unique set of  doppler \" or  acoustic \" peaks between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . the relative position and height and the detailed shape of the peaks provides more independent constraints than there are parameters in the inflationary scenario and allow their determination .",
    "defect models , including cosmic strings and textures , provide an alternative to inflation .",
    "such models predict a non - gaussian distribution of temperature fluctuations and a power spectrum different from that of inflation .",
    "most cosmological models do not predict the exact cmb temperature pattern that would be observed in our sky , but rather predict a statistical distribution of anisotropies . in the context of such models ,",
    "the cmb temperature observed in our sky is only a single realization drawn from the cosmic statistical distribution .",
    "theoretical models most often predict a power spectrum in spherical harmonic amplitudes ; as the physics of the models leads to primordial fluctuations that are gaussian random fields , the power spectrum is sufficient to characterize the results .",
    "observations of the sky can be expressed as a spherical harmonic temperature expansion @xmath20 . if the original perturbations are gaussian random fields , the @xmath21 are gaussianly distributed , and the power at each @xmath16 is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , is sufficient to characterize the results .",
    "for an idealized full - sky observation , the variance of each measured @xmath24 is @xmath25 c^2_\\ell$ ] .",
    "this sampling variance ( known as cosmic variance ) comes about because each @xmath24 is chi - squared distributed with @xmath26 degrees of freedom for our observable volume of the universe @xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to experimental uncertainties , we account for the _ cosmic sample variance _ uncertainties due to our observation of a single realization in our analyses of the dmr maps .",
    "cosmic variance exists independently of the quality of the experiment .",
    "the power spectrum from the 4-year dmr map is cosmic variance limited for @xmath27 .",
    "the cosmic background explorer ( _ cobe _ ) was nasa s first satellite dedicated to cosmology and is a milestone for that and for the legacy of information that it has provided on the early universe .",
    "much of its results are from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the cmb is a pillar of the big bang model and encodes information about energy release in the early universe , primordial perturbations , and the geometry of the universe .",
    "as mentioned previously the cmb contains information on critical cosmological parameters such as @xmath28 , @xmath1 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "_ cobe s _ legacy of the precise measurement of the cmb spectrum and the discovery and early mapping of the cmb anisotropy low-@xmath16 power spectrum provides a position from which to carry out a program testing our cosmological theories and understanding the early universe precisely .",
    "the differential microwave radiometers ( dmr ) experiment ( @xcite ) discovered cmb anisotropies from analysis of its first year of data @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuations were measured at an angular resolution of @xmath31 at frequencies of 31.5 , 53 , and 90 ghz .",
    "these results were supported by a detailed examination of the dmr calibration and its uncertainties ( @xcite ) and a detailed treatment of the upper limits on residual systematic errors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ cobe _",
    "results were confirmed by the positive cross - correlation between the _ cobe _ data and data from balloon - borne observations at a shorter wavelength @xcite and later by comparison of the _ cobe _ data and data from the ground - based tenerife experiment @xcite at longer wavelengths .",
    "the positive correlation at both longer and shorter wavelengths provides confidence in the results .",
    "the results from analysis of two years of dmr data @xcite reconfirmed the results from the first year data .",
    "this section summarizes the key and most recent results from cobe .",
    "details can be found in the original references and in the most recent firas paper @xcite and in a set of dmr 4-year analysis papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dmr consists of 6 differential microwave radiometers : 2 nearly independent channels , labeled a and b , at frequencies 31.5 , 53 , and 90 ghz ( wavelength 9.5 , 5.7 , and 3.3 mm respectively ) .",
    "each radiometer measures the difference in power between two 7@xmath32 fields of view separated by 60@xmath32 , 30@xmath32 to either side of the spacecraft spin axis @xcite .",

    "attitude control keeps the spacecraft pointed away from the earth and nearly perpendicular to the sun with a slight backward tilt so that solar radiation never directly illuminates the aperture plane .",
    "the combined motions of the spacecraft spin ( 75 s period ) , orbit ( 103 m period ) , and orbital precession ( @xmath33 per day ) allow each sky position to be compared to all others through a highly redundant set of temperature difference measurements spaced 60@xmath32 apart .",
    "the on - board processor box - car integrates the differential signal from each channel for 0.5 s , and records the digitized differences for daily playback to a ground station .",
    "= 7 cm    ground data processing consists of calibration , extensive systematic error analyses , and conversion of time - ordered - data to sky maps @xcite .",
    "checks on the correlated noise in the maps @xcite due to the map - making process indicate they are well below the 1%  level .",
    "the dmr time - ordered - data include systematic effects such as emission from the earth and moon , the instrument s response to thermal changes , and the instrument s response to the earth s magnetic field .",
    "the largest detected effects do not contribute significantly to the dmr maps ; they are either on time scales long compared to the spacecraft spin sampling ( e.g. thermal gain drifts ) or have time dependence inconsistent with emission fixed on the celestial sphere ( e.g. magnetic effects ) . detected and potential systematic effects were quantitatively analyzed in detail @xcite .",
    "data with the worst systematic contamination ( lunar emission , terrestrial emission , and thermal gain changes ) were not used in the map - making process and constitute less than 10% of the data in the 53 and 90 ghz channels .",
    "the remaining data were corrected using models of each effect .",
    "the data editing and correction parameters were conservatively chosen so that systematic artifacts , after correction , are less than 6 @xmath34k rms ( 95% confidence upper limit ) in the final dmr map in the worst channel .",
    "this is significantly less than the levels of the noise and celestial signals .    a dipole @xmath35  mk anisotropy signal ( thermodynamic temperature in galactic coordinates cartesian components [ x , y , z ] = [ -0.2173 , -2.2451 , + 2.4853 ] mk ) is subtracted from the time - ordered differential data prior to forming the 4-year sky maps to reduce spatial gradients within a single pixel .",
    "a small residual dipole remains in the maps from a combination of cmb and galactic emission .",
    "the mean signal - to - noise ratios in the 10@xmath32 smoothed maps are approximately 0.5 , 1.5 , and 1.0 for 31 , 53 , and 90 ghz , respectively . for a multi - frequency co - added map",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath36 2 .",
    "this signal - to - noise level is adequate to portray an accurate overall visual impression of the anisotropy .",

    "well off the galactic plane these are clearly true cmb anisotropy features .",
    "simulated data in combination with the noise appropriate to 1- , 2- , and 4-years of dmr 53 ghz observations show the convergence of the dmr maps with the input simulated data . increasing years of data result in the emergence of the input large scale features",
    ". we can be confident that the large scale features in the 4-year dmr maps are real features rather than confusing noise .    given the sensitivity of the 4-year dmr maps we have extended the cut made in our previous analyses to exclude additional galactic emission .",
    "we use the _ cobe _ dirbe 140 @xmath34 m map as a guide to cut additional galactic emission features .",
    "the full sky dmr maps contain 6144 pixels .",
    "an optimum galactic cut maximizes the number of remaining pixels while minimizing the galactic contamination .",
    "this cut leaves 3881 pixels ( in galactic pixelization ) while eliminating the strongest @xmath37 galactic emission .",
    "moderate changes to this cut will cause derived cmb parameters to change somewhat , but this is consistent with the data sampling differences of real cmb anisotropy features and not necessarily galactic contamination .",
    "likewise , derived cmb parameters also vary by the expected amount when the maps are made in ecliptic rather than galactic coordinates since about 1/2 of the noise is re - binned .",

    "since this emission is uncorrelated with cmb anisotropies it constitutes @xmath41% of the cmb power .",
    "the amplitude of the correlated free - free component at 53 ghz agrees with a noisier estimate of free - free emission derived from a linear combination of dmr data which includes _ all _ emission with free - free spectral dependence .",
    "the combined dust and free - free emission contribute @xmath42k _ rms _ at both 53 and 90 ghz , well below the 30 @xmath34k cosmic signal .",

    "* dipole @xmath48 : * the cmb anisotropy is dominated by a dipole term attributed to the motion of the solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame . a precise determination of the dipole must account for galactic emission and the aliasing of power from higher multipole orders once pixels near the galactic plane are discarded .",
    "one can account for galactic emission by using a linear combination of the dmr maps or by cross - correlating the dmr maps with template sky maps dominated by galactic emission @xcite .",
    "the high - latitude portion of the sky is fitted for a dipole with a cmb frequency spectrum using a pixel - based likelihood analysis @xcite .",

    "the cmb quadrupole amplitude observed at high latitude is @xmath55 @xmath34k , where the quoted errors reflect the 68% confidence uncertainties from random statistical errors and galactic modeling errors , respectively .",
    "the observed quadrupole amplitude , @xmath56 , has a lower value than the quadrupole expected from a fit to the entire power spectrum , @xmath57 , but whether this is a chance result of cosmic variance or reflects the cosmology of the universe can not be determined from _ cobe _ data .",
