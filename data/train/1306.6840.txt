    "the role played by the electronic spin in nominally non - magnetic surfaces has attracted a considerable interest in the last two decades due to the potential applications of these systems in the emergent field of spintronics   @xcite . soon after the discovery of a spin - splitted surface band in the au(111 ) metallic surface  @xcite , a large variety of surfaces has been intensively examined ,",
    "both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that the origin of the surface electron spin - splitting resides on the lack of the inversion symmetry close to the surface area .",
    "interestingly , recent model calculations  @xcite suggest the important role played by the in - plane inversion asymmetry in the enhancement of the spin - splitting magnitude , as well as in the determination of the spin - polarization structure .    among the many surfaces exhibiting spin - splitting phenomena , semiconductor substrates covered by a single heavy - element overlayer",
    "demonstrate specially encouraging properties for possible spintronic applications  @xcite . on one hand , these type of surfaces have been recently found to exhibit exceptional relativistic effects  @xcite , inducing spin - orbit energy shifts two orders of magnitude bigger than those found at normal semiconductor heterojunctions . from the practical point of view",
    ", heavy elements such as tl or sb are widely used in electronic instruments like infrared detectors  @xcite or hall - effect devices  @xcite .",
    "another important property of semiconductor surfaces is the band gap associated to the semiconductor substrate , which ensures the two - dimensional character of the transport properties and the absence of any appreciable bulk contribution , both conditions being indispensable for an effective manipulation of the surface spin - state .",
    "the tl / si(111 ) surface is an outstanding example in which the spin - orbit interaction plays a critical role in determining the transport properties of the system .",
    "the honeycomb layered structure of the si(111 ) substrate induces a singular spin - pattern in momentum space that departs from simple pictures such as the rashba model  @xcite .",
    "this peculiar property is farther enhanced by the strong relativistic effects associated to the tl overlayer , producing a highly complex spin - configuration in the neighborhood of the fermi level . in this article",
    ", we investigate the nature of the spin - orbit interaction on two different terminations of the tl / si(111 ) surface describing the relativistic electronic structure and the momentum dependent spin - polarization .",
