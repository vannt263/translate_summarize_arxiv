    "the study of trapped bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has had a high impact in recent years in a number of fields , including atomic , molecular , and optical physics , nuclear physics , condensed matter physics , chemical physics , applied mathematics , and nonlinear dynamics  @xcite . from the point of view of the latter ,",
    "the topic of particular interest here is that at the mean field level , the inter - particle interaction is represented as a classical , but nonlinear self - action @xcite , leading to the now famous gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation as a celebrated model for becs in appropriate settings .",
    "this has resulted in a large volume of studies of nonlinear excitations , including the prediction of excited states @xcite , the experimental observation of dark @xcite , bright @xcite and gap @xcite solitons in quasi - one - dimensional systems , as well as theoretical and experimental investigations of vortices , vortex lattices @xcite , and ring solitons @xcite in quasi - two - dimensional systems .    apart from purely nonlinear dynamical techniques , such as the perturbation theory for solitons employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , other methods based on the corresponding linear schrdinger problem may also be employed for the study of excited becs . in particular , the underlying linear system for a harmonic external trapping potential is the quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) @xcite , whose eigenstates are well - known since schrdinger s original treatment of the problem in 1926 . beginning with the linear equation , solutions can be numerically continued to encompass the presence of the nonlinear representation of the inter - particle interaction .",
    "then , the qho states can persist , bifurcate , or even disappear .",
    "this path does not seem to have been exploited in great detail in the literature .",
    "in one spatial dimension , it has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite , to illustrate the persistence @xcite and dynamical relevance @xcite of the nonlinear generalization of the qho eigenstates . in higher dimensions , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite illustrated the existence of solutions in a radially symmetric setting .",
    "further progress has been hampered by the additional difficulties in ( a ) examining the linear stability and ( b ) converting the radial coordinate system to a cartesian one to study evolution dynamics , including nonlinear stability .",
    "however , the mathematical tools for such an analysis exist , as we discuss in more detail below , and have to a considerable extent been used in ref .",
    "@xcite , especially in connection with ring - like structures with vorticity .    in this paper we present a systematic analysis of the existence , linear stability , and evolution dynamics of the states that exist in the spectrum of harmonically confined condensates from the linear limit , and",
    "persist in the nonlinear problem .",
    "our analysis shows that in the case of repulsive interactions ( defocusing nonlinearity ) , the only branch that is _ linearly stable _ consists of the ground state solution , i.e. , a single hump with @xmath5 radial nodes .",
    "all higher excited states are linearly unstable and break up in ways that we elucidate below , if evolved dynamically in our system ; typically this last stage involves also the loss of radial symmetry to unstable azimuthal perturbations . here",
    ", we will treat explicitly the cases of @xmath0 and @xmath1 radial nodes ; we have confirmed similar results for higher number of nodes .    on the other hand , in the case of attractive interactions ( focusing nonlinearity ) ,",
    "the system is subject to collapse in the absence of the potential .",
    "in fact , this constitutes the critical dimension for the underlying nonlinear problem @xcite beyond which collapse is possible . in this case",
    ", we observe that only the ground state branch with small values of the chemical potential , i.e. , a small number of atoms , can be marginally stable . once again , all excited states are unstable and the typical scenario here involves the manifestation of collapse - type catastrophic instabilities @xcite , as we elucidate through numerical simulations .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows : in section ii , we provide the theoretical setup and numerical techniques . in section iii ,",
    "we present and discuss the relevant results . in section iv ,",
    "we summarize our findings and present our conclusions . finally , in the appendix we provide relevant details regarding our numerical methods .",
    "we will use as our theoretical model the well - known gp equation in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) setting . as is well - known ,",
    "the `` effective '' 2d gp equation applies to situations where the condensate has a nearly planar , i.e. , `` pancake '' shape ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . )",
    "we express the equation in harmonic oscillator units @xcite in the form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the 2d wave function ( the subscript denotes partial derivative ) .",
    "the wave function is the condensate order parameter , and has a straightforward physical interpretation : @xmath8 is the local condensate density .",
    "the external potential @xmath9 assumes the typical harmonic form , with @xmath10 being the effective frequency of the parabolic trap ; the latter can be expressed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the confinement frequencies in the radial and axial directions , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath13 for the pancake geometry considered herein ; in particular , we choose @xmath14 for our computations .",
    "finally , @xmath15 is the normalized coefficient of the nonlinear term , which is fixed to @xmath16 for attractive interactions and to @xmath17 for repulsive interactions .",
    "accordingly , the squared @xmath18 norm is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of atoms and @xmath21 is the usual nonlinear coefficient in the gp equation in harmonic oscillator units , renormalized to two dimensions appropriately  @xcite .    in order to numerically identify stationary nonlinear solutions of eq .",

    "consequently , any simulations based upon a chebyshev - fourier polar grid can be written to strictly use the positive @xmath84-axis , resolving the computational time and storage problems , but still benefiting from the advantages of spectral methods .",

    "this integral can then be restated in the form of an initial value ode @xmath103 and discretized using chebyshev nodes , thus replacing the derivative by the chebyshev spectral differentiation matrix @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath102 here is the discrete version of the integrand above , @xmath106 , and the boundary condition , @xmath107 , is imposed by stripping off the last row and column of @xmath104 to obtain the @xmath108 matrix @xmath109 .",
