    "vortex solitons , for example , perturbation of the precise balance between nonlinearities and diffraction and between gain and losses may result in the quenching of the solitary regime .    although there is no known light beam that can overcome the attenuation effects of linear absorption , there are light beams , known as nonlinear unbalanced bessel beams ( nl - ubbs ) that can propagate without any diffraction and attenuation while their energy is transferred to matter nonlinearly via multiphoton absorption @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that a high - order bessel beam propagating in a medium with nonlinear absorption is not completely absorbed , but survives in the form of a new propagation invariant vortex beam in which the beam energy and orbital angular momentum are permanently transferred to matter and at the same time refueled by spiral inward currents of energy and angular momentum . unlike vortex solitons and dissipative vortex solitons , </S>",
    "<S> these vortex beams are not supported by specific dispersive nonlinearities ( self - focusing or self - defocusing ) and do not require gain . </S>",
    "<S> propagation invariance in presence of multiple absorption of photons carrying ( possibly high ) orbital angular momentum makes these beams attractive for optical pumping of angular momentum over long distances . </S>"
