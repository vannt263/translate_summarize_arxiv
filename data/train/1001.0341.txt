    "transcription factors ( tfs ) , a class of proteins , regulate gene transcription through their physical interactions with particular dna sites .",
    "such a dna site is called a transcription factor binding site ( tfbs ) , which is usually a short piece of nucleotide sequence ( e.g. , ` cattgtc ' ) .",
    "typically , a tf can bind different sites and regulate a set of genes .",
    "a key observation is that sites of the same tf share similarity in their sequence composition , which is characterized by a motif .",
    "since gene regulation has always been an important problem in biology , many computational methods have been developed to predict whether a given dna sequence can be bound by a tf .",

    "( 2006 ) , ji and wong ( 2006 ) , and vingron et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for recent reviews on relevant methods .",
    "the prediction of tfbs s considered in this article is formulated as a classification problem .",
    "denote by @xmath0 the width of the binding sites and code the four nucleotide bases , a , c , g and t , by a set of positive integers @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "suppose that we have observed a sample of labeled sequences of length @xmath0 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 indicating whether @xmath6 is bound by the tf ( @xmath7 ) or not ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we call @xmath9 observed binding sites ( or motif sites ) and @xmath10 background sites ( or background sequences ) .",
    "then , motif detection is to construct a discriminant function from @xmath11 to predict the label of any new sequence @xmath12 .",
    "most of the existing computational methods for motif detection can be classified into two groups .",
    "the starting point of the first group is the sequence specificity of binding sites , which is often summarized by the position - specific weight matrix ( wm ) . for early developments of wm ,",
    "please see stormo ( 2000 ) . under the wm model ,",
    "each nucleotide ( letter ) in a binding site is assumed to be generated independently from a multinomial distribution on @xmath13 .",
    "this model has been widely used in search of tfbs s ( e.g. , hertz and stormo , 1999 ; kel et al . , 2003 ;",

    "the second group aims at modeling physical binding affinity between a tf and its binding sites via the concept of the gibbs free energy ( fe ) or binding energy ( e.g. , berg and von hippel , 1987 ; stormo and fields , 1998 ; gerland et al .",
    ", 2002 ; kinney et al . , 2007 ) . assuming that each nucleotide in a dna sequence of length @xmath0 ( @xmath0-mer ) contributes additively to the interaction with the tf , this approach often leads to a regression - type model for the conditional distribution of binding affinity given a piece of nucleotide sequence ( e.g. , djordjevic et al . 2003 ; foat et al .",
    "this group of methods have tight connections with predictive modeling approaches to gene regulation , reviewed in bussemaker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which can be regarded as a natural generalization to the free energy framework ( zhou and liu , 2008 ) .",
    "although the standpoints are different , the two groups of approaches are in some sense closely related .",
    "they often give similar discriminant functions for predicting tfbs s , and there are many fe - based methods that use a weight matrix to approximate gibbs free energy ( e.g. , granek and clarke , 2005 ; roider et al . , 2007 ) .    in spite of the fast methodological development on the wm and the fe models ,",
    "there is still a lack of solid theoretical analysis to compare model assumptions , parameter estimations and response predictions of the two approaches .",
    "such theoretical analysis can provide insights into these methods by seeking answers to a series of questions .",
    "for example , what are the common and distinct assumptions between the wm and the fe models , what is the relative performance between the two approaches in predicting tfbs s given a certain data generation mechanism , and how to calculate their predictive error rates when the size of observed sample @xmath11 becomes large ?",
    "without answering these questions , one may find it difficult to understand the nature of these methods and can not extract the full information contained in extensive empirical comparisons between the two approaches . in this article",
    ", we compare model assumptions and parameter estimations of typical wm and fe approaches , derive asymptotic error rates of their predictions under different data generation models , and perform comparative studies on large - scale binding data .",

    "when the training sample size is small , the wm procedure seems to produce fewer errors than the fe procedure .",
    "but when we have observed enough binding sites , the advantage of the fe procedure is clearly seen .",
    "on one hand , it gives a comparable or slightly better prediction than the wm approach even if the wmm is more likely for the data ( table  [ tab : chipseq ] , @xmath238 ) . on the other hand , when the data are generated in a way that matches the biophysical process of protein - dna binding such as the pbm data ,",
    "the reduction in error rate of the fe approach can be substantial compared to the wm approach ( table  [ tab : pbm ] , @xmath239 ) .",
    "the relative performance between the two approaches reflects a typical variance - bias tradeoff .",
    "estimation under the wmm is simple and more robust , which typically has a smaller variance than the fem . for a small sample size",
    ", predictive errors are mostly caused by variance in estimation and thus , wm - based predictions may outperform fe - based predictions . when the sample size increases , estimation variance decreases for both approaches and",
    "the potential bias in the wm approach becomes the main factor for predictive errors .",
    "given that its primary principle comes from the biophysics of protein - dna interactions , the fem has become more attractive , based on which many computational methods have been developed for predicting tf - dna binding . in these methods",
    "a weight matrix is sometimes used as a first order approximation for computing free energy - based binding affinity .",
    "this work suggests that this approximation must be applied with caution .",
    "the results on the pbm data have demonstrated that the wm procedure may give a prediction with 50% or more errors compared to the fe - based decision for a reasonably large sample size ( table  [ tab : pbm ] ) .    in recent years , a substantial amount of large - scale tf - dna binding data have been generated for many important biological processes . as demonstrated by the applications to chip - seq data and pbm data ,",
    "large - sample theory is able to provide valuable insights on statistical estimation and prediction for such large - scale data .",
    "the results in this article can be regarded as a first step towards a theoretical development on computational approaches for gene regulation analysis .",
    "incorporation of within - motif dependence in the wmm and interaction effects in the fem is a direct next step of this work , for which the model selection component needs to be considered in a theoretical analysis .",
    "although desired , further generalizations to methods for _ de novo _ motif discovery , identification of _ cis_-regulatory modules and predictive modeling of gene regulation will be more challenging future directions .",
