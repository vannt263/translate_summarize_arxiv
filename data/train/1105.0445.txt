    "the study of the final state of the gravitational collapse of initially regular distributions of matter is one of the open problems in classical general relativity , having attracted remarkable attention in past decades .",
    "when a sufficiently massive star exhausts all the thermonuclear sources of its energy , it would undergo a collapsing scenario due to its own gravity , without reaching a final state in terms of a neutron star or white dwarf . under a variety of circumstances , singularities will inevitably emerge ( geodesic incompleteness in space - time ) , matter densities and space - time curvatures diverging .",
    "albeit the singularity theorems @xcite state that there exist space - time singularities in a generic gravitational collapse , they provide no information on the nature of singularities : the problem of whether these regions are hidden by a space - time event horizon or can actually be observed , remains unsolved .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc ) , as hypothesized by penrose @xcite , conveys that the singularities appearing at the collapse final outcome must be hidden within an event horizon and thus no distant observer could detect them . a black hole forms .",
    "although the ccc plays a crucial role in the physics of black holes , there is yet no proof of it , due to the lack of adequate tools to treat the global characteristics of the field equations .",
    "nevertheless , in the past 30 years many solutions to the field equations have been discovered , which exhibit the occurrence of naked singularities , where the matter content has included perfect and imperfect fluids @xcite , scalar fields @xcite , self - similar models @xcite and null strange quarks @xcite . basically , it is the geometry of trapped surfaces that decides the visibility or otherwise of the space - time singularity . in case",
    "the collapse terminates into a naked singularity , the trapped surfaces do not emerge early enough , allowing ( otherwise hidden ) regions to be visible to the distant observers .",
    "the gravitational collapse of scalar fields is of relevance @xcite , owing to the fact that they are able to mimic other types of behaviours , depending on the choice of the potentials .",
    "scalar field models have been extensively examined for studying ccc in spherically symmetric models @xcite , non - spherically symmetric models @xcite and also for static cases @xcite .",
    "their role in understanding the machinery governing the causal structure of space - time was available since the 90 s , when the numerical solutions exhibiting naked singularities were found numerically by choptuik @xcite and analytically by christodoulou @xcite .",
    "there are in the literature a few papers discussing gravitational collapse in the presence of a scalar field joined by a fluid for the matter content@xcite : in summary , a black hole forms in these collapsing situations .",
    "however , to our knowledge , a tachyon scalar field has not yet been considered regarding whether a black hole or naked singularity forms , that is to say , in the ccc context , together with a fluid .",
    "tachyon fields arise in the framework of string theory @xcite and have been of recent use in cosmology @xcite .",
    "the action for the tachyon field has a non - standard kinetic term @xcite , enabling for several effects whose dynamical consequences are different from those of a standard scalar field @xcite",
    ". namely , other ( anti-)friction features that can alter the outcome of a collapsing scenario .",
    "this constitutes a worthy motivation to investigate the scenario where a tachyon field is added to a barotropic fluid , both constituting the matter content present in the collapse process : on the one hand , the fluid will play the role of conventional matter from which a collapse can proceed into , whereas , on the other hand , the tachyon would convey , albeit by means of a simple framework , some intrinsic features from a string theory setting .",
    "restricting ourselves herein to the tachyon as the intrinsic string ingredient influencing the collapse , let us nevertheless point that many other string features could be incorporated in subsequent similar studies @xcite .",
    "our purpose , in this paper , by investigating the gravitational collapse of a barotropic fluid together with a tachyon field , is therefore to establish the types of final state that can occur ( i.e. , whether a black hole or a naked singularity emerges , in the context of the ccc ) , which matter component will determine the outcome . in particular , if the late time tachyon behaviour , possibly competing with the fluid and eventually becoming dominant , could allow interesting features to appear .",
    "we then organize this paper as follows .",
    "in section [ collapse ] we give a brief review on the gravitational collapse of a specific space - time , namely the marginally bounded case ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in section [ classic ]",
    "we study , by means of a dynamical system analysis , the gravitational collapse employing a tachyon and a barotropic fluid as the matter content .",
    "the analytical study is complemented by a careful numerical investigation . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we present our conclusions and a discussion of our results .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the space - time region inside the collapsing sphere which will contain the chosen matter content .",
    "an isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , in comoving coordinates , will be considered as the interior space - time for the gravitational collapse . however , in order to study the whole space - time , we must match this interior region to a suitable exterior . in the model herein ,",
    "it is convenient to consider a spherically symmetric and inhomogeneous space - time such as the schwarzschild or the generalized vaidya geometries to model the space - time outside the collapsing sphere .      in order to further illustrate this specific gravitational collapse process ,",
    "let us employ a very particular class of solutions .",
    "we assume that the behavior of the matter density , for @xmath32 , is given by the following ansatz ) is spatially homogeneous , it is obvious that , the energy - momentum tensor must also be spatially homogeneous . ] ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are positive constants ) and pressure ( [ pressapprox ] ) , the weak energy condition can be written as follows @xmath36 the weak energy condition is satisfied throughout the collapse process ( see also next section for more details regarding the issue of the energy conditions ) . ] .",
    "integration of the first equation in ( [ einstein-1 ] ) gives the following relation for the mass function as @xmath37 hence we have @xmath38    it is therefore possible to identify the following outcomes :    * for @xmath39 , the ratio @xmath40 is less than unity throughout the collapse and if no trapped surfaces exist initially , due to the regularity condition ( @xmath41 for a suitable value of @xmath34 and @xmath5 ) , then no trapped surfaces would form until the epoch @xmath42 .",
    "more precisely , there exists a family of radial null trajectories emerging from a naked singularity . * for @xmath43",
    ", the ratio @xmath44 goes to infinity and trapped surfaces will form as the collapse evolves , which means that singularity will be covered and no radial geodesics can emerge from it .",
    "thus , a black hole forms .    from equation ( [ energyapprox ] ) , we may easily find a relation between the energy density and pressure as @xmath45 which shows that for @xmath46 , where a naked singularity occurs , the pressure gets negative values @xcite . from equations ( [ einstein2 ] ) , ( [ energyapprox ] ) and bearing in mind the continuous collapse process @xmath47 we can solve for the scale factor as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the time at which the energy density begins increasing as @xmath50 and @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath49 . assuming that the collapse process initiates at @xmath52 , the time at which the scale factor vanishes corresponds to @xmath53 , implying that the collapse ends in a finite proper time .",
    "the model we employ to study the gravitational collapse has an interior space - time geometry as described above ( see e.g. @xcite ) . concerning the matter content",
    ", we consider a spherically symmetric homogeneous tachyon field together with a barotropic fluid .",
    "we use an inverse square potential for the tachyon field given by @xcite , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant .",
    "note that we can consider the potential ( [ potential ] ) as two ( mirror ) branches ( see figure [ pot - v2 ] ) , upon the symmetry @xmath56 , treating the @xmath57 and @xmath58 separately .",
    "the total energy density of the collapsing system is therefore @xmath59 , with @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the energy density of the barotropic matter , whose pressure @xmath62 , in terms of the barotropic parameter , @xmath2 , satisfies the relation @xmath63 , the barotropic parameter being positive , @xmath64 .",
    "then , the raychadhuri equation for the collapsing system can be written as @xmath65 furthermore , the equation of motion for the tachyon field can be obtained as @xmath66.\\label{field}\\ ] ] the energy conservation of the barotropic matter is @xmath67 integrating ( [ consenrbaro ] ) , the energy density for barotropic matter can be presented as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a constant of integration .",
    "the total pressure is given by @xmath70    in order to have a physically reasonable matter content for the collapsing cloud , the tachyon field and the barotropic fluid would have to satisfy the weak and dominant energy conditions @xcite : for any time - like vector @xmath71 , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 and @xmath74 must be non - space - like .",
    "since for the symmetric metric ( [ metric ] ) we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 , then , for the energy densities and the pressures of the tachyon field and the barotropic fluid the energy conditions amount to the following relations @xmath77 the first two expressions in equations ( [ ec1 ] ) and ( [ ec2 ] ) denote the ` weak energy condition ' ( wec ) , and the last expression denotes the ` dominant energy condition ' ( dec ) .    for a tachyon field , it is straightforward to show that the wec is satisfied : @xmath78 in addition , since @xmath79 , then @xmath80 from which it follows that @xmath81 , and hence , the dec is satisfied for the tachyon matter .    for the barotropic fluid",
    "considered herein , we assume a regular initial condition for the collapsing system , such as @xmath82 , indicating that @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath84 , then @xmath85 provided that @xmath64 ; through this paper we will consider the positive barotropic parameter @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the wec is satisfied . on the other hand ,",
    "considering the dec ( @xmath86 ) it follows that the barotropic parameter @xmath2 must satisfy the range @xmath87 ( cf . the phase space analysis in section [ classic1 ] ) .",
    "we analyze in this ( sub)section the gravitational collapse of the above setup by employing a dynamical system perspective .",
    "we introduce a new time variable @xmath88 ( instead of the proper time @xmath4 present in the comoving coordinate system @xmath89 ) , defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 ( the limit @xmath92 corresponds to an initial condition of the collapsing system ( @xmath93 ) and the limit @xmath94 corresponds to @xmath95 ) . for any time dependent function @xmath96 ,",

    ", attractor solutions can be described .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath100 near the point @xmath127 can be approximated as @xmath180 ; hence , as @xmath94 ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) , @xmath100 vanishes .",

    "the tracking solution indicates @xmath233 as the threshold ( illustrated in figure [ 2d - stream ] ) , which distinguishes a black hole or a naked singularity forming .",

    "in fact , if we assume a very unbalanced initial ratio @xmath222 with @xmath234 and a barotropic fluid having @xmath231 , then we can have a situation where the ratio ( [ massd ] ) is converging .",
    "the set of initial conditions described by @xmath234 are equivalent to consider the barotropic fluid as initially dominant .",
    "if this specific unbalanced distribution of matter is allowed to evolve into a regime where the tachyon dominates then the system will evolve until @xmath235 becomes comparable to @xmath236 .",
    "the singularity is reached in finite time and it can happen before the tachyon can effectively dominate .",
    "in figure [ naked singularity ] we have a graphical representation of the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "it can be seen that the ratio @xmath44 remains finite for @xmath214 , while the energy density is diverging , as the collapse proceeds and apparent horizon is delayed or fails to form till the singularity formation .",
    "as the right plot shows , the validity of wec is guaranteed throughout the collapse scenario for both barotropic fluid and tachyon field .",
    "also the dec is valid for the solutions that exhibit naked singularity , i.e. , those for which @xmath214 .",
    "[ naked singularity ]      point @xmath134 does not represent an attractor and hence its vicinity will not corresponds to a collapse endstate .",
    "however , trajectories emerging from it would proceed towards @xmath127 or @xmath133 .",
    "the time dependence of the tachyon field near @xmath134 can be obtained integrating @xmath237 as @xmath238 in the @xmath57 branch , the tachyon field starts to increase with time from its initial value at @xmath186 ( where @xmath239 ) , proceeding uphill the potential .",
    "then , a stage is obtained where a maximum ( but finite ) value is reached , when the tachyon field goes to its minimum and nonzero value at @xmath240 .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "since @xmath243 is a constant , the hubble rate at @xmath206 reads @xmath244 and the total energy density of the system is essentially the energy density of the tachyon field and is given by @xmath245 which is proportional to the tachyon potential .",
    "therefore , at the time @xmath246 , when the tachyon field reaches its non - zero minimum , the total energy density of the system remains finite . in the limit case , when the time @xmath247 , the tachyon field vanishes , the tachyon potential diverges .",
    "alternatively , we can also write that tachyon behaves as @xmath248 when @xmath95 , the tachyon field vanishes , and hence , the potential and energy density of tachyon field in equation ( [ cenerg ] ) , as a function of @xmath226 , is given by @xmath249 and diverges at @xmath205 .",
    "the dynamics of the system in vicinity of this fixed point is given by @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 , where @xmath162 .",
    "concerning @xmath141 , the energy density of the tachyon field is approximately given by the tachyon potential @xmath253 ( with @xmath254 ) and thus , in its vicinity , the tachyon potential remains constant and finite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath255 and @xmath256 imply that the total energy density is given by the energy density of barotropic matter only : @xmath257 .",
    "this solution diverges as @xmath95 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath145 for the range @xmath140 presents solutions for the collapsing system in which @xmath258 asymptotically is given by @xmath259 , for the @xmath57 and @xmath260 for the @xmath58 branch . for the @xmath57 branch ,",
    "the time dependence of the tachyon field is given by @xmath261 the tachyon starts its evolution from the initial configuration @xmath200 , and decreases uphill the potential .",
    "then , at the time @xmath262 the tachyon field vanishes , the potential diverging branch , the time dependence of the tachyon field is given by @xmath263 .",
    "therefore the tachyon field starts its evolution from the initial configuration at @xmath264 , decreasing in time , going uphill the potential . ] .",
    "a thorough numerical analysis of the trajectories in the vicinity of point @xmath152 has shown that it behaves as an unstable node .",
    "we can observe in the center plot of figure [ 2d - stream ] an illustration of the general behavior near this point , namely having trajectories diverging from it .      in order to complete the full space - time geometry for the herein collapsing model",
    ", we need to match the homogeneous interior space - time to a suitable ( inhomogeneous ) exterior geometry . for",
    "a perfect fluid gravitational collapse set up , with equation of state @xmath265 , the pressure does not necessarily vanish at the boundary .",
    "e.g. , matching the internal geometry filled with matter ( and radiation ) to a boundary layer ( which is crossed with the radiation ) , which could in turn be matched to an exterior geometry , not completely empty ( e.g. , filled by radiation ) . more concretely , matching the interior with a generalized exterior vaidya space - time across the boundary given by @xmath266 @xcite .    similarly to @xcite ,",
    "we proceed by considering the interior metric which describes the collapsing cloud as @xmath267 and the exterior one in advanced null coordinates @xmath268 given by @xmath269 in these coordinates the outermost boundary of trapped surfaces is simply given by the relation @xmath270 .",
    "it should be noticed that in general the formation of the singularity at @xmath205 is independent of matching the interior to the exterior space - time . in order to find a suitable exterior metric function @xmath271 we resort to an hamiltonian perspective of the model .",
    "the total hamiltonian constraint is given by @xcite @xmath272 where @xmath273 and @xmath274 are the conjugate momentums for the scale factor @xmath226 and for the tachyon field @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the hamilton equations for parameters @xmath226 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 can be obtained by using the equation ( [ hamiltonian - cl ] ) as follows : @xmath275 on the other hand , since the hamiltonian constraint , @xmath276 , must be held across the boundary @xmath277 , equation ( [ hamiltonian - cl ] ) reduces to @xmath278 whereby , substituting for @xmath273 and @xmath274 from equation ( [ eqs-1])-([eqs-3 ] ) , we get @xmath279 furthermore , it is required for the junction condition @xmath280 and the equation of motion for scale factor @xmath281 to be satisfied at the boundary of two regions . by substituting these conditions in the hamiltonian constraint equation , @xmath282 , given by ( [ fex ] )",
    ", we get @xmath283=\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{b}}\\right)^{4}\\left[\\frac{v^{2}}{1-\\dot{\\phi}^{2}}-\\rho_{0\\text{b}}^{2}\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{b}}\\right)^{-6\\gamma}\\right],\\label{area}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that , we have substituted the four - velocity of the boundary being seen from the exterior by @xmath284 ( cf .",
    "then , by solving equation ( [ area ] ) for @xmath285 , the boundary function is obtained simply as @xmath286    let us now study the behavior of the boundary function for the stable fixed point solutions we obtained in the previous subsections .",
    "we note that the above expression is valid when both the tachyon field and barotropic fluid are present , thus in the regimes where the tachyon field is dominant the contribution of the fluid to hamiltonian constraint is set aside . for the dust - like solutions , described by points @xmath123 and @xmath198 , the energy density of tachyon field at the boundary @xmath287 , included in second term of equation ( [ exteriormf ] ) , is given by @xmath288 .",
    "so , the boundary function @xmath285 in equation ( [ exteriormf ] ) reduces to : @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "equation ( [ exteriormf - dust ] ) for @xmath291 constrains the exterior space - time to have a schwarzschild metric in advanced null coordinates , providing an interpretation of the collapsing system as a dust ball with the radius @xmath287 and the density @xmath292 . on the other hand , for the fixed point solution @xmath145 , by using the equation ( [ energ - e ] ) in ( [ exteriormf ] ) , we have @xmath293 where @xmath294",
    "( notice that , this corresponds to the case in which @xmath295 in previous subsection ) .    in order to get a possible class of dynamical exterior solutions , we proceed by considering the following metric at the boundary @xcite @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the total mass within the collapsing cloud . matching the for exterior metric function gives @xmath298 in which , the second part stands for matching for the extrinsic curvature .",
    "differentiation of the first expression in ( [ matching ] ) with respect to time and using the second one , we get @xmath299 multiplying the first expression in equation ( [ matching ] ) by @xmath300 and after adding the result with the above equation , we get @xmath301 now , by substituting for @xmath302 into equation ( [ matching ] ) , we obtain @xmath303 then , as seen from equation ( [ massd ] ) for @xmath214 , where the trapping of light has failed to occur , the exterior geometry is dynamical in contrast to the tachyon dominated regime in which a space - like singularity forms with a static exterior space - time . finally , for fluid dominated solutions , depending on the value of @xmath2 , both naked singularities and black holes may form , the mass being different to those of tracking solutions and the exterior geometry being static or dynamical , respectively .",
    "in this paper we considered a particular setting among the spherically symmetric class of models for gravitational collapse , with a tachyon field and a barotropic fluid as matter content .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the marginally bound case ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a description and details ) .",
    "the tachyon potential was assumed to be of an inverse square form .",
    "our objective was to establish ( i ) which final states would occur ( namely , a black hole or a naked singularity ) , ( ii ) how each matter component will compete ( the fluid being conventional , whereas the tachyon bringing some workable but intrinsic non - standard effects from string theory ) and , ( iii ) which will eventually be the determinant component at the end of the collapse process .",
    "more precisely , in our opinion it is of interest to assert , if and how , at later stages , effects induced by the tachyon ( a scalar field ( among others ) found in string theory context ) , could allow interesting features to be eventually discussed ( i.e. , what asymptotic behaviour emerges ) .",
    "as far as the tachyon field is concerned , from eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) we can have that with @xmath304 and @xmath305 , @xmath258 terms act like an anti - friction contribution at a collapsing phase , within an uphill evolution for the @xmath306 potential for tachyon field ( i.e. , when @xmath307 ) . moreover , other terms ( i.e. the term including @xmath308 ) would have an anti - friction effect as well .    determining therefore the outcome of the gravitational collapse in our system , i.e. ,",
    "whether , e.g. , a black hole or naked singularity would form , was not a straightforward assessment .",
    "we considered an analytical description by means of a phase space analysis @xcite , discussing several asymptotic behaviours ; these were also subject to a careful study involving a numerical investigation , which added a clearer description of the possible dynamical evolutions . within this setting ,",
    "for a spatially homogeneous interior space - time , we found a situation where the tachyon was dominant , with a black hole forming i.e. , @xmath309 . in both models , the collapsing systems lead to the black hole formation . ] .",
    "a cosmological framework involving only a frw geometry , with a tachyon field and a barotropic fluid , was investigated in @xcite , focusing on the late time ( dark energy like ) stages .",
    "it is interesting to note that while for a tachyon dominated regime , an inflationary - like ( i.e. , accelerated expansion ) scenario leads to violation of the strong energy condition ( sec ) .",
    "thus , the sec holds if @xmath310 . ]",
    "@xcite , in our collapse scenario we have instead a corresponding asymptotic stage , where tachyon dominance leads to black hole formation , satisfying the sec at the final state of the collapse ( cf .",
    "figure ( [ f3b ] ) ) .",
    "the same behaviour is observed in the fluid dominated regime , where for @xmath132 the sec is satisfied by the fluid , with a black hole formation .",
    "however , for the tracking solutions , where a naked singularity forms , i.e. , @xmath311 and @xmath214 , the sec is violated .    moreover , in further comparison with the set of fixed points found in @xcite for an expanding ( accelerating ) universe ( @xmath312 ) , we have found analytically two additional critical points ( @xmath285 and @xmath313 ) for the collapse process which correspond to a barotropic dominated collapsing regime which ends in a black hole for @xmath132 , respecting the wec and sec .",
    "indeed , for the late - time acceleration of the universe , filled with a tachyon field and a fluid , the phase space analysis in @xcite predicted two class of solutions : a tachyon dominated solution ; and a tracking solution @xcite .",
    "rather differently , corresponding solutions herein our paper turn to be unstable towards the singularity in the collapse process .",
    "nevertheless , two other solutions are also provided in our collapsing scenario : a tachyon dominated solution where @xmath2 satisfies the range @xmath131 , initially ; and a barotropic dominated solution for which the barotropic parameter holds the range @xmath132 .",
    "all these solutions predict a black hole formation as collapse end state .    further regarding the tracking solutions ( of a cosmological nature ) indicated in @xcite . in our collapsing system ,",
    "a different and rather interesting set of states is found , within the context of tracking behavior for the barotropic fluid plus tachyon field content .",
    "being more concrete , these solutions have that a black hole or naked singularity forms .",
    "in particular , in this situation , we found that it is possible to define by a numerical appraisal in particular , the threshold @xmath314 , separating black hole and naked singularity solutions for the gravitational collapse .",
    "we have also discussed the specific conditions leading to the formation of a naked singularity .",
    "therefore , we concluded , that in our model , if the collapse starts with an unbalanced distribution of the matter content favoring the barotropic fluid , i.e. @xmath315 , then towards the final stage of the collapse they evolve until @xmath316 , when a naked singularity forms .",
    "however , since the nec is satisfied , the strong curvature condition along the null geodesics can be preserved and the singularity can be strong in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we think it is fair to indicate that we employed a @xmath306 potential for the tachyon , whereas for @xmath317 , the tachyon should not induce a divergent behavior as far as string theory advises @xcite .",
    "in fact , an exponential - like potential for the tachyon could bring a richer set of possible outcomes @xcite , including a better behaved and possibly a more realistic evolution when dealing with @xmath317 .",
    "finally , let us add that it will be of interest to investigate ( i ) other scenarios for the geometry of the interior space - time region , ( ii ) specific couplings between the tachyon and the fluid , within e.g. , a chamaleonic scenario for gravitational collapse and black hole production ( broadening the scope in @xcite ) , ( iii ) adding either axionic , dilatonic or other terms ( e.g. , curvature invariants ) that could be considered from a string setup , but at the price of making the framework severely less workable and ( iv ) whether explicit quantum effects can alter the outcomes presented in this paper . to this purpose latter",
