    "radiative corrections to different physical quantities needed for the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data to be collected with the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and , in future , with an international linear collider ( ilc ) and other colliders are expressed in terms of complicated feynman integrals . in many cases ,",
    "radiative corrections must be evaluated analytically to achieve reliable accuracies in the calculations .",
    "the difficulties in calculating feynman integrals are usually related to the fact that they depend on several kinematical scales , i.e.  they are functions of several variables .    nowadays ,",
    "one of the most frequently used methods for calculating feyman integrals is based on the mellin - barnes integral representation @xcite . in many cases",
    ", however , this method leads to complicated expressions in terms of hypergeometric functions with many variables . in order to calculate analytically integrals with several kinematical variables and masses , new effective methods are to be developed .",
    "rather promising methods for analytic calculations of feynman integrals are based on recurrence relations .",
    "these can be recurrence relations with respect to the exponent of a propagator of the integral @xcite or the parameter of the space - time dimension @xcite . as was already observed in the one - loop case ,",
    "the solutions of dimensional recurrences are combinations of hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "this is also true at the two - loop level @xcite .    as was realized many years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , feynman integrals are generalized hypergeometric functions .",
    "this conjecture was confirmed through the evaluations of specific feynman integrals .",
    "some results for feynman integrals expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions may be found in refs .",
    "these results were obtained using rather different methods , e.g.   by directly evaluating the integrals from their feynman parameter representations , by applying mellin - barnes integral representations , by solving recurrence relations , by making use of the negative - dimension approach @xcite , or by using spectral representations .    as a method for finding relations between hypergeometric functions , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite advocated the evaluation of integrals reducible to hypergeometric functions by several different methods and the comparison of the results thus obtained . in this respect ,",
    "the evaluation of feynman integrals may be considered as a rich source for finding relations between hypergeometric functions .",
    "new transformation and reduction formulae for hypergeometric functions were derived by calculating feynman integrals already a long time ago @xcite .",
    "several new reduction relations for the appell hypergeometric functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 obtained by comparing different results for the same feynman integral were presented in ref .",

    "the analytic evaluation of feynman integrals offers us a unique possibility to find relations between hypergeometric functions which can be useful in many other applications , far away from high - energy physics . on the other hand ,",
