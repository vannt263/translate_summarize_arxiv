    "the importance of non - hermitian operator has been recognized in many areas of physics in recent years , both on an applied level and on a fundamental level .",
    "such non - hermitian operators commonly appear , for example , when we discuss irreversible processes in open systems @xcite , as well as @xmath0 ( parity - time ) symmetric systems @xcite .",
    "it is well known that an effective liouvillian ( which is called a collision operator in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ) for open quantum system takes a non - hermitian form ( see appendix b and @xcite ) .",
    "an example of such non - hermitian operator can be found when the partial trace of the environment is carried out @xcite .    among many characteristic properties of the non - hermitian operators , the appearance of exceptional points ( eps ) in parameter space",
    "is especially interesting @xcite and it has been studied in many contexts in recent years @xcite .",
    "the ep is a singular point in the parameter space at which two eigenstates coalesce . as a result",
    "the non - hermitian operator is not diagonalizable at this point . instead",
    ", the operator can be reduced to the jordan block form with the aid of a pseudo - eigenstate for a pair of coalesced eigenstates @xcite .",
    "this singularity manifests itself in that the normalization constant of the eigenstate diverges at the ep @xcite .    due to the divergence in the eigenstate representation , we encounter difficulties when we investigate physical properties of the system near the eps .",
    "they cause problems , for example , when we evaluate numerical values of physical quantities on the basis of the eigenstate expansion , because each contribution from the eigenstates becomes divergent .    in this paper , we propose a non - divergent representation of the non - hermitian operator which is applicable in all regions in the parameter space , hence remove the difficulty mentioned above .",
    "we obtain this representation by introducing a generalization of the pseudo - eigenstate that appears at the eps for the jordan block calculation .    in the present paper , we give the detailed description of the representation by a general @xmath1 non - hermitian operator .",
    "this is because the most likely case for an ep to occur is the two level coalescence @xcite and all essential properties of the case can be illustrated with a @xmath1 matrix @xcite .",
    "we apply this non - divergent representation to boltzmann s collision operator for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) perfect quantum lorentz gas @xcite as a working example .",
    "the lorentz gas gives us one of the simplest examples of the non - hermitian operators that has the eps in the eigenvalue problem of the liouvillian .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first time that the ep problem has been studied at the level of the liouvillian .",
    "we stress , however , that this representation is applicable to any non - hermitian operators having eps including the case of the effective hamiltonian that appears in a wide class of quantum mechanics .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we summarize general properties of an ep with a general @xmath2 non - hermitian matrix . in section 3",
    "we derive a standard jordan block structure at the ep in terms of the pseudo - eigenstate representation of the @xmath2 matrix . in section 4",
    "we introduce an extended pseudo - eigenstate for the matrix to obtain a representation that remains non - divergent in all region of the parameter space . in section 5",
    "we present an application of our representation to the 1d perfect quantum lorentz gas . in the first three subsections of sec.5 we give an introduction of the model and the derivation of boltzmann s collision operator in terms of the theory of complex spectral representation of the liouvillian @xcite . in subsection 5.4",
    "we present spectrum and eigenstates of the collision operator .",
    "there we also present standard jordan block representation of the collision operator with the pseudo - eigenstates . in subsection 5.5",
    "we construct the extended pseudo - eigenstates for the system and present the extended jordan block representation of the collision operator . in subsection 5.6",
    "we discuss the time evolution of the distribution function using both the eigenstates representation and the extended pseudo - eigenstates representation . in subsection 5.7",
    "we numerically estimate the time evolution of the system near the ep , and demonstrate that our non - divergent representation significantly improves the accuracy of the numerical calculation as compared with the calculation using the conventional eigenstate representation . in subsection 5.8 we give some remarks on physical aspects of the ep in the spectrum of the liouvillian and its relation to the transport process of the system . in section 6",
    "we summarize our results and give discussions . in appendix",
    "a we discuss the generalization of the extended pseudo - eigenstate representation to the multiple coalescence of an arbitrary number @xmath3 of eigenstates at a so - called ep@xmath3 @xcite . in appendix",
    "b we give a brief summary of the complex spectral representation of the liouvillian for use in sec.5 .",
    "let us give a brief summary of mathematical properties of eps .",
    "mathematically , the _ exceptional points _ ( eps ) are defined as branch point singularities in the parameter space of the spectrum of a matrix at which two or more eigenstates coincide @xcite .",
    "its significant difference from the usual degeneracy lies in the fact that both the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates coalesce .",
    "since the hermitian operator has a complete set of eigenstates , eps occur only in the spectrum of non - hermitian operator .    over the wide range of non - hermitian physical systems , the most common case for an ep to occur is the two level coalescences since multiple level coalescence requires that more parameters should be fine - tuned to satisfy conditions for coalescence @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , we restrict our detailed study to the two level coalescence .",
    "generalization of our main result to the multiple coalescence is straightforward and is briefly presented in appendix a. in the case of a two level coalescence , we can illustrate all essential properties of the eps with a @xmath2 matrix .",

    "first , we consider the traditional eigenstate expansion . using the @xmath185 representation , we have @xmath186 with @xmath187 i.e. , @xmath188    on the other hand , using the extended pseudo - eigenstates with the set @xmath175 , we have @xmath189 where @xmath190 with @xmath191",

    "we note that eq.([eq : fourier - comp - red ] ) is a fourier component of the wigner function ( see eqs.([eq:10 ] ) and ( [ def : wignerrepresentation ] ) ) .",
    "let us now compare the expressions in eqs.([eq:62 ] ) and ( [ eq:65 ] ) .",
    "each matrix element in the eigenstate expansion ( [ eq:62 ] ) diverges at the eps @xmath198 .",
    "hence , the expression ( [ eq:62 ] ) following from the eigenstate expansion generally leads to serious difficulty when we consider in the vicinity of the eps .",
    "on the other hand , we have no such difficulty with the expression ( [ eq:65 ] ) since each matrix element is well defined even at the eps .",
    "we now demonstrate the relevancy of the normalizable representation in terms of the pseudo - eigenstates by evaluating the time evolution of @xmath199 with an initial condition @xmath200 and @xmath201 for the case @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is an ep with @xmath198 ( see [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) . here",
    "the real part of @xmath199 for the initial condition has no divergence caused by the ep .",
    "then , here we show the time evolution of its imaginary part im@xmath207 $ ] .    in fig.[fig :",
    "error](a ) , we present the result using the eigenstate representation ( [ eq:62 ] ) .",
    "we evaluate this by calculating the time evolution of each component separately in this representation , and sum up the results of all components .",
    "as we can see , each component of ( [ eq:62 ] ) diverges at the ep .",
    "therefore , numerical behavior with the eigenstate representation near the ep is not reliable when the parameter @xmath5 approaches the value at the ep .    in fig.[fig : error](b ) , we present the corresponding result in terms of our extended pseudo - eigenstate representation given in eq.([eq:65 ] ) , where each component has a well - defined value at the ep . as expected , there is no singularity in the vicinity of the eps .",
    "actually the curve in fig.[fig : error](b ) consists of 4 lines with different values of @xmath5 , but we can not distinguish them in the resolution drawn in this figure . since the original equation does not have any singularity at the ep , the true behavior does not have any singularity as in the case of fig.[fig : error](b ) .",
    "since we have dealt with the liouvillian system as an example of operator with eps , here we give some remarks on physical aspect of eps in the system .",
    "these remarks give some perspectives to the reader to understand physical consequence of eps in the spectrum of the liouvillian on the transport processes .",
    "we first discuss spectral properties of boltzmann s collision operator . in the original variables @xmath208 and @xmath209 , eigenvalues of the collision operator @xmath49 are written as @xmath210 where @xmath211 .    if the wavenumber @xmath113 is small , and in the region @xmath212 , both of the eigenvalues take imaginary values .",
    "in this situation , we expand these eigenvalues in power series of @xmath213 as @xmath214 @xmath215 here , first few terms in the expansion of @xmath60 become dominant in hydrodynamic situation , namely @xmath216 and @xmath217 , and they give transport coefficients of hydrodynamic equation @xcite .",
    "for instance , the first term , which is the second order in @xmath113 , gives diffusion coefficient @xmath218 hence , the eigenstate with @xmath60 corresponds to diffusive motion of the system in the hydrodynamic situation .",
    "the higher contribution in the series expansion corresponds to burnett terms @xcite .",
    "another eigenvalue @xmath44 corresponds to a decaying mode , which is damped in the hydrodynamic situation .",
    "on the other hand , if the wavenumber becomes larger , and lies in the region @xmath219 , both of the eigenvalues have real parts @xmath220^{1/2},\\ ] ] hence , both eigenstates are damped oscillating modes with damping rate @xmath221 . in the real space ,",
    "both of them correspond to damping wave propagation with a phase velocity @xmath222^{1/2}.\\ ] ] as the wavenumber @xmath113 becomes larger , the phase velocity @xmath223 approaches the velocity of the free particle .",
    "hence , @xmath224 leads to a phase transition from the over damping situation to the oscillating damping situation .    as a result of above arguments on spectral properties ,",
    "we have seen that the eigenmodes for @xmath212 correspond to diffusive process and the eigenmodes for @xmath219 correspond to damping wave propagation with damping rate @xmath221 . here , the eps play a role of boundaries of these qualitatively different processes .",
    "the coexistence of these different processes is a generic property of the systems that have eps in the wavenumber space of the spectrum of the liouvillian , since these eps always appear as boundaries of the pure imaginary values and complex values of the eigenvalues .",
    "we now show that the existence of eps leads to the telegraph equation , which describes combined processes of the diffusive process and the damping wave propagation .",
    "first we introduce the wigner distribution function for the test particle @xmath225 where @xmath199 is defined by ( [ eq : fourier - comp - red ] ) . in terms of the original variables @xmath208 and @xmath226 , the characteristic equation ( [ eq : characteristic ] ) is written as @xmath227 the inverse fourier - laplace transformation of ( [ eq : b1 ] ) leads to the telegraph equation @xmath228 in other words , eq.([eq : b1 ] ) is the same as the characteristic equation of the telegraph equation with regard to the @xmath229- and @xmath230-dependence as @xmath231 $ ] .",
    "hence our boltzmann equation ( [ eq : kineticeq ] ) is equivalent to the telegraph equation @xcite with regard to the dependence of the wigner function on @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the equivalence of boltzmann s equation and the telegraph equation in their time development in real space is remarkable , since the telegraph equation represents a prototypical behavior of the system with a second order ep in the spectrum of the liouvillian with respect to the wavenumber .",
    "this is because , as we have shown in sec.2 , when the spectrum of the liouvillian has a second order ep in the wavenumber space , the characteristic equation is always reduced to the quadratic form ( [ eq : b1 ] ) locally near the ep .",
    "we now show that the telegraph equation reduces to the diffusion equation in long - time behavior . to see this we observe fig.1b .",
    "all decaying modes except for eigenstates with small pure imaginary eigenvalues have vanished in a long time region . for the remaining modes , @xmath232 , and",
    "the first term of ( [ eq : b1 ] ) is much smaller than the second term .",
    "hence , the characteristic equation ( [ eq : b1 ] ) reduces to @xmath233 then , inverse fourier - laplace transformation of ( [ eq : b2 ] ) leads to the diffusion equation , @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the diffusion coefficient given by ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) .    let us now summarize this subsection .",
    "when the system under consideration has the second order eps in the wavenumber space of the spectrum of the liouvillian , the time development of the system in the real space is described by the telegraph equation that combines the diffusive process and the damping wave propagation .",
    "then , in the long time behavior such as @xmath217 , the telegraph equation asymptotically reduces to the diffusion equation .",
    "since the second order eps are the most likely case and the characteristic equation of the operator is always reduced to the quadratic equation of the form ( [ eq : b1 ] ) near the second order eps , above description of the time development of the liouvillian system with eps is quite generic .",
    "we have introduced a non - divergent representation of non - hermitian operators that remains finite even at the eps in a parameter space .",
    "the representation has been obtained by extending the pseudo - eigenstates to the entire parameter space .",
    "we have applied this representation to the collision operator of the boltzmann equation for the 1d perfect quantum lorentz gas .",
    "then we have shown that this representation removes the difficulty resulting from the divergence of the normalization constant at the eps in the usual eigenstate expansion .",
    "indeed , we have demonstrated a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of the numerical evaluation of the time evolution of the distribution function in terms of our representation .",
    "there we have also shown physical aspects of the eps in the liouvillian system . as we have shown in the subsection 5.8 . in sec.5 ,",
    "when the liovillian system has the second order eps in the wavenumber space , such a spectral structure leads to the telegraph equation that combines two qualitatively different processes in time development of the system , namely the diffusive process and the damping wave propagation . in the long time behavior , the damping wave vanishes and the time development is reduced to usual diffusion .    in our recent studies",
    ", we have realized that wide range of liouvillian systems such as the two - dimensional classical perfect lorentz gas @xcite or one - dimensional polaron system also have the second order eps in the wavenumber space .",
    "therefore , appearance of the second order eps in the wavenumber space is a quite common nature of the liouvillian system .",
    "although these systems are rather complicated than the 1d perfect quantum lorentz gas , we expect that our essential view on the role of eps on the transport process can be applicable to these systems . we will discuss it in a separate publication .",
    "in recent years , multiple coalescence where an arbitrary number @xmath3 of eigenstates coalesce at a single ep , called ep@xmath3 , has also been studied @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we also show that our extended pseudo - eigenstate representation can be generalized to the ep@xmath3s .",
    "the eps are non - hermitian degeneracy points .",
    "it is well - known that degeneracy in a hermitian operator leads to the berry phase effect @xcite as reported in many experiments , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "recently , it is clarified that the berry phase - like effect plays an important role in the study of quantum pumping processes based on quantum kinetic equations ( quantum master equations ) @xcite .",
    "similar to the degenerate hermitian operator , it is interesting to investigate the effects coming from the degeneracy in non - hermitian operators and the phase change of the eigenstates around the eps .",
    "indeed , one can find many theoretical @xcite and experimental papers @xcite on this subject .",
    "we will discuss the implication of our extended pseudo - eigenstate representation on the phase of the eigenstates in the vicinity of the eps elsewhere .",
