    "the stabilisation of unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) using feedback control has attracted the attention of many authors over a number of years .",
    "the time - delayed feedback method of pyragas  @xcite , has been of particular interest . here , the feedback @xmath0 is proportional to the difference between the current and a past state of the system .",
    "specifically , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is some state vector , @xmath3 is the period of the targeted upo and @xmath4 is a feedback gain matrix .",
    "advantages of this method include the following .",
    "first , since the feedback vanishes on any orbit with period @xmath3 , the targeted upo is still a solution of the system with feedback .",
    "control is therefore achieved in a non - invasive manner .",
    "second , the only information required a priori is the period @xmath3 of the target upo , rather than a detailed knowledge of the profile of the orbit , or even any knowledge of the form of the original odes , which may be useful in experimental setups .",
    "the method has been implemented successfully in a variety of laboratory situations  @xcite , as well as analytically and numerically in spatially extended pattern - forming systems  @xcite ; more examples can be found in a recent review by pyragas  @xcite .    until now",
    ", there has been little or no study on whether there are limitations to pyragas feedback control as the period of the targeted orbit , and hence the delay time , becomes large . in this paper , we investigate the use of pyragas feedback on unstable periodic orbits with arbitrarily large period .",
    "one mechanism for the generation of long - period periodic orbits is at bifurcations from homoclinic orbits or heteroclinic cycles . in this paper",
    "we focus on a subcritical bifurcation from a symmetric heteroclinic cycle , specifically the heteroclinic cycle of guckenheimer and holmes  @xcite .",
    "the bifurcation produces a branch of unstable long - period periodic orbits and we investigate using a time - delayed feedback control similar to the pyragas feedback as a stabilisation mechanism .",
    "the addition of pyragas feedback to the odes considered by guckenheimer and holmes results in an infinite - dimensional delay equation . in order to analyse trajectories near the periodic orbit of interest",
    ", we make a number of assumptions about the form of solutions to the delay - differential equation and reduce the flow to a three - dimensional map .",
    "this method , after the assumptions have been made , is a modified version of the standard ` small box and poincar map ' analysis used by many authors to study the dynamics of trajectories close to heteroclinic cycles .",
    "this reduction of an infinite - dimensional delay equation to a finite dimensional map has not appeared before in the literature .",
    "although our assumptions are not fully rigorously justified , we test the validity of our arguments by comparing our results with a numerical example .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the analytical and numerical results .",
    "a surprising result of the analysis for the particular example we use is that as the period of the orbit increases , the amplitude of the gain parameter required to stabilise the unstable orbits decreases .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : rev ] we give a review of heteroclinic cycles and their bifurcations .",
    "we describe the guckenheimer  holmes heteroclinic cycle , and summarise the standard approach to analysing trajectories close to heteroclinic cycles . in section  [ sec : feed ] we describe how we choose the feedback control terms which are added to the equations .",
    "we then perform the reduction of the equations described above , which gives us a method of computing the stability of the periodic orbits . section  [ sec : num ] contains numerical examples and section  [ sec : conc ] concludes .",
    "a heteroclinic cycle is a topological circle of connecting orbits between at least two saddle - type equilibria . in generic ( non - symmetric ) dynamical systems ,",
    "heteroclinic cycles are of high codimension and their existence for open sets of parameter values is unexpected .",
    "if a dynamical system contains flow - invariant subspaces , the connecting orbits can be contained within these subspaces , and then the heteroclinic cycle is robust to perturbations of the system that preserve the invariance of these subspaces .",
    "flow invariant subspaces can arise due to symmetry , or due to other restrictions on the flow ( such as extinctions in population dynamics models  @xcite ) .",
    "the review of krupa  @xcite contains many examples of robust heteroclinic cycles . in this paper",
    "we consider robust heteroclinic cycles in symmetric systems .",
    "consider a continuous - time dynamical system defined by an ode : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a @xmath7-equivariant vector field , that is , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a finite lie group .",

    "a heteroclinic cycle is an invariant set @xmath16 consisting of the union of a set of equilibria @xmath17 and orbits @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a heteroclinic connection between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; and @xmath20 .",
    "we require that @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 is a homoclinic orbit .",

    "@xmath36 is a saddle and @xmath15 is a sink for the flow restricted to @xmath37 , 2 .   there is a heteroclinic connection from @xmath36 to @xmath15 contained in @xmath37 .",
    "robust heteroclinic cycles occur as codimension - zero phenomena in systems with symmetry .",
    "that is , they can exist for open sets of parameter values .",
    "bifurcations of heteroclinic cycles therefore occur as codimension - one phenomena .",
    "we now consider the computation of the stability of heteroclinic cycles and the associated bifurcations .",
    "the stability of a heteroclinic cycle is usually computed by constructing poincar maps on a poincar section of the flow .",
    "the flow near the cycle is divided into two parts ; the ` local ' part , near the equilibria , where the flow can be well approximated by the linearised flow about the equilibria , and the ` global ' part of the flow , where the trajectory is away from the equilibria .",
    "the global part of the flow occurs on a much faster timescale than the local part and can be approximated by a linearisation of the flow around the heteroclinic connections .",
    "the construction of such poincar maps is a standard procedure , details can be found in , for example  @xcite .",
    "heteroclinic cycles generically lose stability in two ways : resonant bifurcations and transverse bifurcations .",
    "transverse bifurcations occur when one of the eigenvalues at an equilibrium passes through zero ; the equilibrium undergoes a local bifurcation . we do not consider transverse bifurcations here ,",
    "see  @xcite for details . throughout this paper ,",
    "when we refer to ` the eigenvalues at an equilibrium ' , we of course mean the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix of the flow linearised about that equilibrium .    at a resonant bifurcation",
    "the eigenvalues at the equilibria are generically non - zero , but satisfy an algebraic condition that determines a global change in the stability properties of the cycle .",
    "resonant bifurcations were first studied in the non - symmetric case by chow et  al .",
    "@xcite in the context of a bifurcation from a homoclinic orbit .",
    "a more recent study  @xcite considers a codimension - two resonant bifurcation from a robust heteroclinic cycle with complex eigenvalues .",
    "resonant bifurcations are generically accompanied by the birth or death of a long - period periodic orbit .",
    "if @xmath38 is the bifurcation parameter controlling the resonant bifurcation ( that is , @xmath39 at the bifurcation point ) , then the period @xmath40 of the bifurcating periodic orbit generically scales as @xmath41 resonant bifurcations can occur in a supercritical or subcritical manner .",
    "we consider the subcritical case , when the branching periodic orbits are unstable , and in the following show that pyragas - type time - delayed feedback can stabilise the periodic orbits .",
    "our analysis focuses on the guckenheimer ",
    "holmes cycle in @xmath42 .",
    "the guckenheimer ",
    "holmes cycle  @xcite is a prototypical example of a robust heteroclinic cycle .",
    "we use this cycle as an example on which to base our analysis .",
    "first we review the original case with no feedback .",
    "the equations considered by guckenheimer and holmes can be written : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are real parameters .",
    "the equations are equivariant under the symmetry group @xmath47 , generated by a reflection @xmath48 and a rotation @xmath49 : @xmath50 we label the equilibrium on the positive @xmath51-axis as @xmath14 . here , and throughout the remainder of the paper , subscripts on equilibria , coordinates and similar objects should be taken mod @xmath52 .",
    "each two - dimensional coordinate plane is a fixed point subspace . if @xmath53 , then the only equilibria in each coordinate plane are those lying on the coordinate axes .",
    "we consider the case @xmath54 and then it can be shown that in the plane @xmath55 , @xmath56 is a saddle and @xmath57 is a sink . it can additionally be shown that in forward time trajectories are bounded away from infinity and therefore by the poincar bendixson theorem there exists a heteroclinic connection from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , connections also exist from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , and @xmath58 to @xmath56 .",
    "these connections lie in two - dimensional fixed - point subspaces ( the two - dimensional coordinate planes ) , so the cycle is robust .",
    "the resulting heteroclinic cycle is shown schematically in figure  [ fig : ghcyc ] .",
    "also note that @xmath25 , so the cycle is homoclinic .",
    "the stability of the cycle can be calculated using the methods described above .",
    "it is a standard procedure , but we outline the method here , as we use similar ideas later when considering the stability of periodic orbits in the system with added time - delayed feedback . consider a trajectory which passes close to the equilibrium @xmath56 .",
    "the linearised flow near @xmath56 is : @xmath59 the @xmath60 direction is the ` radial ' direction , and as shown in  @xcite , for heteroclinic cycles of this type , the radial direction does not affect the stability of the cycle .",
    "all trajectories move away from the origin , and also away from infinity , and in this case are attracted to an ` invariant sphere '  @xcite which contains the heteroclinic cycle . therefore ,",
    "for simplicity , we henceforth ignore this component .",
    "we define poincar sections close to @xmath56 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and construct a poincar return map on @xmath63 . consider a trajectory which passes through @xmath64 at time @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the trajectory will hit @xmath67 at @xmath68 with @xmath69 we thus write down a local map @xmath70 , which describes the flow near the equilibria : @xmath71 the flow near the heteroclinic connection from @xmath67 to a plane @xmath72 near @xmath57 is approximated by the global map @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the @xmath76 coordinate of the trajectory when it next hits @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is a positive constant . note that the constant term in this expansion of @xmath73 is zero because the plane @xmath55 is invariant .",
    "we write @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath80 , the map @xmath81 is a return map on @xmath63 .",
    "write @xmath82 and then the return map is @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "the map @xmath85 has fixed points at @xmath86 and at @xmath87 .",
    "the fixed point at @xmath86 corresponds to the heteroclinic cycle in the flow and is stable if @xmath88 . the heteroclinic cycle loses stability in a resonant bifurcation at @xmath89 .",
    "the second fixed point at @xmath90 corresponds to a branch of periodic orbits , as long as @xmath91 is small and positive .",
    "the symmetry @xmath49 acts as a spatio - temporal symmetry on the periodic orbits .",
    "that is , if we write the periodic solution as a trajectory @xmath92 , with minimal period @xmath40 , then @xmath93    the stability of the orbits can be determined by finding the stability of the fixed point @xmath91 in the map @xmath94 .",
    "it is simple to see that if @xmath95 , @xmath91 is small and positive ( and hence corresponds to a periodic orbit in the flow ) when @xmath88 , so the resonant bifurcation is subcritical .",
    "we find that @xmath96 and so @xmath91 is unstable .",
    "conversely , if @xmath97 , then @xmath91 corresponds to a branch of stable periodic orbits if @xmath98 , and the bifurcation is supercritical .",
    "the period @xmath40 of the orbit is approximately @xmath99 where @xmath100 and is the time spent by the trajectory each time it passes close to an equilibrium .",
    "we are ignoring the time spent away from the equilibria ( that is , close to the heteroclinic connections in the invariant planes ) since it is much less than @xmath40 when we are close to the resonant bifurcation , that is , @xmath101 .    in equations  ,",
    "the resonant heteroclinic bifurcation at @xmath102 is degenerate .",
    "that is , the branch of periodic orbits exists only at @xmath102 .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath103 in the map @xmath94 .",
    "we add additional higher order terms to break this degeneracy , specifically we consider @xmath104 the additional terms preserve the equilibria and the symmetries of the system , and also the invariant planes and the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "the heteroclinic cycle still loses stability in a resonant bifurcation at @xmath102 , but now a branch of periodic orbits is created in either @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "the sign of @xmath107 determines the branching direction and whether , in the map @xmath94 , @xmath78 is greater or less than @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath109 , we see a branch of unstable periodic orbits in @xmath105 ( and the resonant bifurcation is subcritical ) .",
    "if @xmath110 , we see a branch of stable periodic orbits in @xmath106 ( and the bifurcation is supercritical ) .",
    "a complete study of the effect of fifth order terms on the dynamics near the gh cycle has not been performed .",
    "however , the above assertion can be seen by considering the effect of the new term on the @xmath51 component when the trajectory is close to the @xmath111 plane but away from either coordinate axis .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the subcritical case , where the periodic orbits are unstable , and add non - invasive time - delayed feedback to stabilise the orbits near the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "to ease analysis and improve the accuracy in the numerical computations in section  [ sec : num ] , we introduce new coordinates @xmath112 . along with a change in timescale , this transforms equations   to @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "note that in these coordinates , the equilibria are at , e.g.  @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "the invariant planes in the @xmath51 coordinates are transformed to @xmath117 .",
    "however , we are not interested in trajectories which lie in the coordinate planes , only those which are close to them .",
    "pyragas feedback is additive and has the form @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a ( real ) gain matrix and @xmath40 is the period of the targeted periodic orbit .",
    "our choice of coordinates suggests the following slightly altered functional form for the feedback : @xmath120 for trajectories close to the periodic orbit , @xmath121 and so the feedback terms are approximately of pyragas form . for this choice of feedback ,",
    "the equilibria and the invariance of the coordinate planes ( in the original @xmath51 coordinates ) are preserved .",
    "however , we additionally choose to use the symmetries of the system to make a further change in the form of the feedback which simplifies the subsequent analysis .",
    "the feedback we use is : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is one - third of the period of the orbit . due to the spatiotemporal symmetry of the periodic orbit under the action of @xmath49",
    ", the feedback vanishes at the periodic orbit , and so the periodic orbit is still a solution of the system .",
    "however , this feedback does not preserve the equilibria or invariant planes ( in the original @xmath51 coordinates ) .",
    "we choose the matrix @xmath119 in a similar manner to that in  @xcite , as follows .",
    "we write @xmath124 where @xmath125 the matrix @xmath126 has the form of the feedback matrix used by fiedler  _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite in a two - dimensional example ; stabilising periodic orbits emanating from a subcritical hopf bifurcation . recall that the orbit has two unstable directions , and one stable direction  the radial direction .",
    "the matrix @xmath127 is chosen so the feedback is rotated to align with the unstable directions , and there is no feedback in the stable direction .",
    "the resulting equations with feedback are @xmath128 where @xmath129      we analyse the stability of the periodic orbits close to the heteroclinic cycle in a similar manner to the methods used without feedback .",
    "we assume we are close to the resonant bifurcation , that is , @xmath101 , so that the periodic orbit lies close to the heteroclinic cycle , and consider the flow close to the periodic orbit .",
    "the linearised equations close to the equilibrium @xmath56 are given by : @xmath130 where the @xmath131 are the components of the feedback gain matrix @xmath119 .",
    "as before we neglect the @xmath132 equation  since the feedback only acts in directions tangent to the plane containing the periodic orbit , we assume that when trajectories are close enough to the periodic orbit the dynamics in the radial direction are unaffected .",
    "that is , near @xmath56 , the @xmath132 direction will be contracting and so not affect the stability of the orbit . in section  [ sec :",
    "just ] we show numerical results which support this assumption .",
    "recall that the periodic orbits we are attempting to stabilise are spatiotemporally symmetric under the action of @xmath49 .",
    "we make use of this in the following . at each equilibrium , we define a contracting direction , and an expanding direction . at @xmath14 , the contracting direction",
    "@xmath133 is the @xmath134 direction , and the expanding direction @xmath135 is the @xmath136 direction .    unlike in the case without feedback , we can not solve the linear equations explicitly , and so we make the following approximations .",
    "let @xmath137 be the periodic orbit for the original system ( in the logarithmic coordinates ) .",
    "then @xmath138 is still a solution of the system with feedback .",
    "consider solving the delay differential equation for the system with feedback for a trajectory @xmath139 which starts close to @xmath138 .",
    "that is , for @xmath140 , @xmath139 is close to @xmath141 .",
    "then for @xmath142 , the feedback terms in the delay differential equation will be small , that is , the equations will only be a small perturbation from the original system . by continuity , the solution @xmath139 for @xmath142 will also be close to @xmath138 .",
    "set @xmath65 as the trajectory intersects the plane @xmath143 ( @xmath144 , for @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) on the @xmath147th time the trajectory passes close to an equilibrium , @xmath14 . with no feedback",
    ", the local part of the trajectory can be written down exactly .",

    ", we can not explicitly solve the linearised equations . given the argument above",
    ", we assume that we start sufficiently close to the periodic orbit that solutions are only a small perturbation away from those for the case with no feedback .",
    "that is , we write , for @xmath151 , @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are functions which satisfy @xmath158 and if the trajectory is exactly the periodic orbit , @xmath159 .",
    "we will use this assumed form of the local flow together with equations   and   and the global flow as before to derive a new return map .",
    "this gives recurrence relations for @xmath153 , and the functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lm ] shows a schematic of the local flow past an equilibrium @xmath14 , in the original @xmath51 coordinates .",
    "we again ignore the time the trajectory spends near the heteroclinic connections but away from the equilibria , so for @xmath160 , the flow is given by @xmath161 using the symmetry @xmath49 , we can rewrite the linear equations   and   as @xmath162 where the delayed terms are the corresponding coordinates near the previous equilibrium , that is @xmath163    the time of flight of the trajectory between the planes @xmath164 and @xmath165 , @xmath166 , will not be equal to the delay time @xmath3 except when the trajectory is exactly on the periodic orbit ( see figure  [ fig : lm ] ) . in order to find the coordinates at @xmath167 , we assume the flow given by   and   is also valid for @xmath168 $ ] . the coordinates of the trajectory at @xmath167",

    "in fact , for this particular case , we see that as @xmath38 gets smaller , in order for the orbit to be stable , we have to choose @xmath214 , the gain parameter , to be increasingly small .",
    "this seems a rather surprising result - that as the period of the targeted orbit increases , the amplitude of the gain parameter tends towards zero .",
    "we note that the recurrence relations   have a second solution , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , which corresponds to the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "we can consider the stability of this solution by considering the solutions to   in the limit @xmath244 . in this limit , @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "the cubic equation   therefore has one solution with @xmath248 and two solutions with @xmath249 .",
    "therefore this fixed point is always unstable in the recurrence relation , and so the heteroclinic cycle is always unstable in the flow .",
    "we use the matlab package dde - biftool  @xcite to numerically analyse the stability of periodic orbits in the system  .",
    "the delay time @xmath3 was set equal to the period of the bifurcating periodic orbits ( and so is a function of @xmath45 ) , and was calculated numerically from the system with no feedback .",
    "parameters used were the same as those used to produce figure  [ fig : stab_anal ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : stab1 ] shows a contour plot of the amplitude of the largest floquet multiplier as the parameters @xmath214 and @xmath45 are varied .",
    "the periodic orbit is stable when all floquet multipliers have amplitude less than @xmath108 , and this region is indicated by the shading in figure  [ fig : stab1 ] . comparison with figure  [ fig : stab_anal ] , showing the stability as calculated analytically , shows a very good agreement between the location of the stability boundaries .",
    "the shapes of the boundaries also agrees , that is , the left hand boundary is a straight line , whereas the lower boundary is part of a parabola .",
    "the nature of the bifurcations that occur as the boundaries are crossed also agrees with the analytical result .",
    "that is , the left hand boundary is a period - doubling bifurcation , with a critical floquet multiplier equal to @xmath250 , and the lower boundary is a steady state bifurcation with a critical floquet multiplier of @xmath251 .",
    "forward integration of the equations   also confirms the stability results . in figure  [",
    "fig : int ] we show results from such an integration .",
    "we also show the derivative of the coordinates and the feedback terms . it can be seen that as the periodic orbit is approached , the derivative of the expanding coordinate tends to @xmath46 ( in this case , @xmath252 ) , and the feedback terms tend towards zero .      in section  [ sec : anal ]",
    "we make a number of assumptions regarding the form of solutions to the delay differential equations .",
    "firstly , we assume that the ` radial ' direction does not affect the stability of the periodic orbits , and so we neglect this coordinate in our construction of a poincar map . secondly , that trajectories starting near the periodic orbits will be only small perturbations from the form of solutions to the original equations without feedback .",
    "thirdly , we make the assumption that @xmath253 , and @xmath198 .    here",
    ", we address each assumption in turn and show that our numerical results support these assumptions .",
    "figure  [ fig : intdiff1 ] shows the feedback terms in a forward integration of equations   as the periodic orbit is approached .",
    "it can be seen here that the feedback terms corresponding to the radial direction are much smaller than the other feedback terms  on this scale they can not be distinguished from zero .",
    "hence the affect of the feedback on the radial direction is negligible and this assumption is justified .    regarding the second assumption ,",
    "it can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : intdiff1 ] that the feedback terms decay to zero as the periodic orbit is approached . however , this is to be expected in the case that the periodic orbit is stable . in figure",
    "[ fig : int_un ] we show the results of an integration in which the periodic orbit is unstable .",
    "it can be seen from the time series in  [ fig : unstable1 ] that the trajectories still remain approximately of the form of the periodic orbit even though the trajectory is moving away .",
    "figure  [ fig : unstable2 ] shows the feedback terms , a measure of how close the trajectory is to the periodic orbit .",
    "although they are increasing in magnitude , they do so in the same manner one would expect for an unstable periodic orbit in ordinary differential equations .",
    "that is , by starting trajectories close enough to the periodic orbit , the feedback magnitude can be bounded above for arbitrarily long time .",
    "the third assumption is that that @xmath253 , and @xmath198 .",
    "note that in the recurrence relations  , the terms in @xmath181 only appear in the combination @xmath254 ( similarly with @xmath182 in the combination @xmath255 ) .",
    "therefore , we only need to show that the difference between @xmath181 and @xmath256 is much smaller than @xmath46 to justify our assumption ( and similar for the @xmath197 ) . for the integration we perform for figure  [ fig : int1 ]",
    "we compute the values of @xmath181 , @xmath152 and @xmath257 ( and the corresponding values for @xmath197 ) on each pass the trajectory makes past an equilibrium .",
    "we plot these values in figure  [ fig : fip ] .",
    "it can be seen that the difference between @xmath258 and @xmath257 ( and between @xmath259 and @xmath260 ) is clearly very small , and is much less than @xmath252 ( @xmath261 ) for this example .",
    "we have shown that a time - delayed feedback control mechanism similar to that first introduced by pyragas can be used to stabilise periodic orbits of arbitrarily large period , specifically those resulting from a resonant bifurcation from a heteroclinic cycle .",
    "our analytical results are based on a analysis of the stabilisation of orbits near the guckenheimer ",
    "holmes cycle .",
    "these results are asymptotic , that is , they are correct in the limit of the periodic orbit being close to the heteroclinic cycle . however , in comparison with numerical results ( which conversely , are much harder to obtain when the orbit is close to the cycle due to the long period of the orbit ) , the results actually agree for some large(ish ) range of parameters away from the bifurcation point",
    ".    it should also be possible to extend this analysis so that it applies to resonant bifurcations from higher dimensional heteroclinic cycles .",
    "however , care may need to be taken with the transverse eigenvalues .",
    "as the resonant bifurcation is approached , the period of the bifurcating periodic orbit grows like @xmath262 , where @xmath38 is the bifurcation parameter .",
    "this is in contrast to the homoclinic bifurcation , in which case the bifurcating periodic orbit has a period which grows like @xmath263 .",
    "this difference in scaling between the growth rate of the periods of the orbits indicates that the results of adding similar time - delayed feedback near a subcritical homoclinic bifurcation may be quite different to the results given here .",
    "work on this problem is ongoing .",
