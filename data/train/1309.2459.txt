    "this is an expository article about type changes of zero mean curvature surfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "klyachin @xcite showed , under a sufficiently weak regularity assumption , that a zero mean curvature surface in @xmath1 changes its causal type only on the following two subsets :    * null curves ( i.e. , regular curves whose velocity vector fields are light - like ) which are non - degenerate ( cf .  definition  [ def : n - deg ] ) , or * light - like lines , which are degenerate everywhere .",
    "recently , actual occurrence of the second case was shown in the authors previous work @xcite .",
    "so we now pay attention to the former possibilities : given a non - degenerate null curve @xmath6 in @xmath1 , there exists a zero mean curvature surface which changes its causal type across this curve from a space - like maximal surface to a time - like minimal surface ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this construction can be accomplished using the bjrling formula for the weierstrass - type representation formula of maximal surfaces . by unifying the results of gu @xcite , klyachin @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", we explain the mechanism for how zero mean curvature surfaces change type across non - degenerate null curves , and give the fundamental theorem of type change for zero mean curvature surfaces(cf .",
    "theorem [ thm : main2 ] ) in the second section of this paper .",
    "locally , such a surface is the graph of a function @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 we call this and its graph the _ zero mean curvature equation _ and a _ zero mean curvature surface _ or _",
    "zero mean curvature graph _ , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the _ space - like parabolic catenoid _ , on the other hand , @xmath9 is given in kobayashi @xcite as an enneper surface of 2nd kind .",

    "in fact , the hyperbolic catenoids @xmath30 are the example of surfaces of type @xmath28 . in @xcite",
    ", the authors pointed out that the light cone @xmath31 is a surface of type @xmath29 . since @xmath31 is neither space - like nor time - like , the existence problem of space - like ( resp .",
    "time - like ) surfaces for this class @xmath29 was left unanswered .",
    "the above two examples resolve this question , that is , the following assertion holds :    the completion of space - like ( resp .",
    "time - like ) parabolic catenoids gives an example of surfaces of type @xmath29 at each point @xmath32 @xmath33 on the light - like line @xmath22 .",
    "in other words , both space - like surfaces and time - like surfaces exist in the class @xmath29 of zero mean curvature surfaces containing light - like lines .",
    "we set @xmath34 then is rewritten as @xmath35 .",
    "we fix a point @xmath32 ( @xmath36 ) on the set @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath38 the implicit function theorem yields that there exists a @xmath39-function @xmath40 such that the set @xmath37 is parametrized by the graph @xmath40 around the point @xmath32 .",
    "by @xcite , we know that @xmath40 has the following expression @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath39-functions . differentiating the equation @xmath44 with respect to @xmath45 , we have that @xmath46 where @xmath47 . substituting @xmath48",
    ", we get @xmath49 which implies that @xmath50 differentiating with respect to @xmath45 again , we have @xmath51 substituting @xmath48 and , we get @xmath52 namely @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that @xmath40 is of type @xmath29 at @xmath54 .    in the authors previous work @xcite , surfaces of type @xmath28 changing type across a light - like line",
    "have been constructed . the only other possibility for the existence of surfaces changing type across a light - like line must be of type @xmath29 ( cf .",
    "so the following question is of interest :    do there exist zero - mean curvature surfaces of type @xmath29 which change type across a light - like line ?",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we give an application of theorem  [ thm : main2 ] to fluid mechanics : consider a two - dimensional flow on the @xmath55-plane with velocity vector field @xmath56 , and with density @xmath57 and pressure @xmath58 .",
    "we assume the following :    1 .",
    "[ item : ass-1 ] the fluid is _ barotropic _ , that is , there exists a strictly increasing function @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) such that the pressure @xmath58 is expressed by @xmath61 . a positive function @xmath62 defined by @xmath63",
    "is called the _ local speed of sound _ , cf .",
    "[ item : ass-2 ] the flow is steady , that is , @xmath64 , @xmath58 and @xmath57 do not depend on time .",
    "[ item : ass-3 ] there are no external forces , 4 .",
    "[ item : ass-4 ] and the flow is irrotational , that is , @xmath65 .    by the assumption [ item : ass-2 ] ,",
    "the equation of continuity is reduced to @xmath66 hence there exists locally a smooth function @xmath67 such that @xmath68 which is called the _ stream function _ of the flow .",
    "the following assertion is well - known :      by the assumptions [ item : ass-2 ] , [ item : ass-2 ] and [ item : ass-4 ] , euler s equation of motion @xmath71 is reduced to @xmath72 that is , @xmath73 here , by the barotropicity [ item : ass-1 ] , we have @xmath74 substituting these into the equation of motion , we have @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 hold .",
    "thus , we have @xmath77 summing these up , it holds that @xmath78 here , by the assumption [ item : ass-4 ] , we have @xmath79",
    ". then we have the conclusion .    when @xmath80 , the equation coincides with the zero mean curvature equation . in this case , yields that @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a positive constant .",
    "this means that the zero mean curvature equation induces a virtual gas . for actual gas ,",
    "the pressure @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath83 , where @xmath6 is a constant ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 for air ) .",
    "differentiating , we have that @xmath86 substituting into , we have that @xmath87 that is , there exists a constant @xmath88 such that @xmath89 here , by , it holds that @xmath90 thus , is equivalent to @xmath91 we suppose that @xmath92 does not vanish identically . then @xmath93 and we may set @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a positive constant",
    ". then we have @xmath96 note that by and the assumption @xmath97 , the speed @xmath98 is greater than ( resp .",
    "less than ) the speed of sound @xmath62 , that is , the flow is _ supersonic _",
    "subsonic ) , if and only if @xmath99 ( resp .",
    "@xmath100 ) .",
    "suppose now that the flow changes from being subsonic to supersonic at a curve @xmath101 without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath102 is an arclength parameter of the curve @xmath103 .",
    "in particular , @xmath104 holds on the curve @xmath103 .",
    "since the local speed of sound is given by @xmath105 the curve @xmath103 is a singularity of the flow , although the stream function itself is real analytic near @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , we suppose that each point of the curve @xmath106 is a non - degenerate point of type change with respect to @xmath69 .",
    "then , as seen in the proof of proposition  [ prop : kl2 ] , we can take the parameter @xmath102 of the curve @xmath103 such that @xmath107 gives a non - degenerate null curve in @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it holds that @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "since @xmath110 at a non - degenerate point of type change , the proof of proposition [ eq : id ] yields that @xmath111 .",
    "since @xmath109 , this implies that @xmath106 is a locally convex curve .",
    "consequently , we get the following assertion :    [ cor : st ] let @xmath112 be a locally convex curve on the @xmath55-plane with an arc - length parameter @xmath102 .",
    "then the graph @xmath113 of the zero mean curvature surface @xmath114 as in theorem  [ thm : main2 ] associated to the null curve @xmath115 gives a real analytic stream function satisfying with i.e. @xmath97 ) which changes from being subsonic to supersonic at the curve @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , @xmath116 gives the velocity vector of the flow such that    1 .",
    "@xmath117 diverges to @xmath118 as @xmath119 approaches the image of @xmath103 .",
    "2 .   the flow changes from being subsonic to being supersonic across @xmath103 .",
    "3 .   the acceleration vector @xmath120 points to the supersonic region .",
    "since @xmath103 is locally convex , its lift @xmath121 is a non - degenerate null curve in @xmath1",
    ". then we can apply theorem [ thm : main2 ] for the curve @xmath122 , and get a graph @xmath123 of a zero mean curvature surface which changes type at @xmath122 .",
    "then @xmath69 can be considered as a stream function which changes from being subsonic to supersonic at the curve @xmath103 .",
    "we set @xmath124 which is the midpoint of the two points @xmath125 of the curve @xmath103 . by theorem [ thm : main2 ] , the flow is supersonic at the point @xmath126 , which proves the last assertion .",
