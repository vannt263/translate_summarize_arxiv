    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite is probably one of the most studied beyond the sm ( bsm ) scenarios .",
    "however , this model suffers from two critical flaws : the @xmath5-problem @xcite and the little hierarchy problem .",
    "the former flaw results from the fact that the superpotential has a dimensional parameter , @xmath5 ( the so - called ` higgs(ino ) mass parameter ' ) , whose natural value would be either 0 or @xmath6 ( the planck mass ) .",
    "however , phenomenologically , in order to achieve electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , @xmath5 is required to take values of the order of the ew scale or possibly up to the tev range .",
    "the latter flaw emerged first from lep , which failed to detect a light",
    "cp - even higgs boson , @xmath7 , thereby imposing severe constraints on @xmath8 . for this kind of higgs state to pass the experimental constraints , large higher order corrections from both the sm and susy particle spectrum are required .",
    "the largest contributions come from the third generation , top quarks and squarks . however , these required large corrections seem quite unnatural .",
    "recall in fact that at tree level the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass of the mssm is less than @xmath9 .",
    "even recent lhc results , hinting at the possible existence of a sm - like higgs state with mass of 124126 gev @xcite , weaken the mssm assumption , as such mass values are really extreme in such a susy realisation , towards the very end of the allowed mass range .",
    "the simplest susy realisation beyond the mssm that can solve these two problems at once is the nmssm ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario includes a higgs singlet superfield in addition to the two mssm - type higgs doublets , giving rise to seven higgs states : three cp - even higgses @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , two cp - odd higgses @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and a pair of charged higgses @xmath14 .",
    "when the scalar component of the singlet superfield acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , an ` effective ' @xmath5-term , @xmath15 , will be automatically generated and can rather naturally have values of order of the ew to tev scale , as required @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the nmssm , the little hierarchy problem can be relieved @xcite , since a sm - like scalar higgs boson in the nmssm context requires less ( s)quark corrections than those in the mssm or it can have mass less than the lep bound due to unconventional decays over some regions of the nmssm parameter space .",
    "in fact , currently , the nmssm can also explain not only the lhc excess @xcite a possible lep excess and is definitely preferred by ew global fits @xcite .",
    "the superpotential of the nmssm is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are dimensionless couplings .",
    "the term @xmath22 has been introduced to solve the @xmath5-problem of the mssm superpotential . however , the superpotential in eq .",
    "( 1 ) without the term @xmath23 gives rise to an extra global @xmath24 symmetry , the so - called peccei - quinn symmetry @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "once the higgs bosons take on vevs , this symmetry will break spontaneously and lead to the appearance of a cp - odd scalar , called a peccei - quinn axion .",
    "in fact , this axion has not been seen experimentally .",
    "in addition , there are severe astrophysical and cosmological constraints on @xmath20 , that is @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these constraints necessitate a very large value of @xmath27 in order to solve the @xmath5-problem .",
    "so , this is not a satisfactory way to solve the latter .",
    "one elegant way to solve the @xmath5-problem is to break the @xmath25 by introducing an additional term in the superpotential .",
    "this is the last term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) and consequently the axion can be avoided .",
    "however , introducing this new term in the superpotential enables one to break the pq symmetry but the superpotential still have a discrete @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "this discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken when the additional complex scalar field acquires a vev and that will lead to the domain wall problem .",
    "that is , during the ew phase transition of the early universe , this broken symmetry causes a dramatic change of the universe evolution and creates unobserved large anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background @xcite .    in order to solve the domain wall problem",
    ", one needs to break the @xmath28 symmetry by introducing higher order operators at the plank scale .",
    "however , these operators generate quadratic tadpoles for the singlet .",
    "so , one also needs to impose a new discrete invariance , a @xmath29 symmetry , on these operators in order to get rid of the dangerous tadpole contributions , see @xcite for more details .",
    "the nmssm higgs sector contains two higgs doublets and one higgs singlet :    @xmath30    the scalar potential for the higgs fields can be written as @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    to generate ewsb , the higgs fields should have vevs .",
    "in fact , if one assumes that the vevs are real and positive , they can be described by @xmath35    at the physical minimum of the scalar potential , @xmath36 , the soft mass parameters of the higgs fields are related to the vevs through the following relations @xcite : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39    the physical higgs states arise after the higgs fields acquire vevs and rotate away the goldstone modes . as a result , the potential can be written as @xmath40    the masses of charged higgs fields , @xmath41 , at tree level are @xmath42 where @xmath43    using the minimisation conditions , one can obtain the mass matrices in the scalar and pseudoscalar sectors .",
    "first , the mass matrix for cp - even higgs states at tree level has the following entries @xcite : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 second , the mass matrix for cp - odd higgs states at tree level has the following entries @xcite : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52    to a good approximation , at large tan@xmath1 and large @xmath53 , the tree level neutral higgs boson masses are given by the following expressions @xcite : @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56 ^ 2 + \\frac{\\lambda^2\\upsilon^2}{2{\\mu^2_{\\rm eff}}}\\bigg[4\\mu^2_{\\rm eff}-m^2_a\\sin^22\\beta\\bigg]^2}}\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath57",
    "because of the existence of a singlet superfield in the nmssm , the latter is phenomenologically richer than the mssm .",
    "in fact , the nmssm has seven higgs states and five neutralinos compared to only five higgs states and four neutralinos in the mssm . as a consequence ,",
    "the search for higgs bosons in the context of the nmssm at present and future colliders is a big challenge and more complicated than in the mssm .",
    "it was mentioned before that the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs boson in the mssm , @xmath8 , at tree level should be less than @xmath9 .",
    "so , large radiative corrections , mainly from top and stop loops , are required to pass the lep lower limit on the higgs mass .",
    "in fact , to achieve this we need large stop masses , which only contribute logarithmically in the loop corrections .",
    "this large discrepancy between top and stop masses causes essentially a fine tuning problem @xcite ( the aforementioned little hierarchy problem ) .    as for the nmssm ,",
    "the situation is quite different . assuming cp - conservation in the higgs sector , the upper mass bound for the lightest cp - even higgs boson at tree level is given by @xmath58 the last term in this expression can lift @xmath59 up to 10 gev higher than the corresponding mass of the mssm .",
    "so , smaller loop corrections are required to pass the lower bound on the sm - like higgs mass . however , since the higher order corrections are similar to those in the mssm , the upper mass bound reaches 135  140 gev for maximal stop mixing and tan@xmath60 @xcite , however , this configuration is already excluded in the mssm by lep data .",
    "finally , notice that the corrections to the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass are already calculated at complete one loop level @xcite and also at the dominant two loop level @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the most interesting property of the nmssm that can solve the little hierarchy problem of the mssm comes from the fact that in large areas of the nmssm parameter space higgs - to - higgs decays are kinematically open . for instance , the existence of the lightest cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 with mass less than @xmath61 is quite natural in the nmssm , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in fact , the branching ratio ( br ) for the decay @xmath62 , br(@xmath62 ) , can be dominant in large regions of parameter space and as a result the br(@xmath63 ) is suppressed .",
    "this unconventional decay channel is so important as it could explain the @xmath64 excess observed at lep for a higgs mass , @xmath65 , around 100 gev as shown in figure [ higgslep ] .",
    "the reduced coupling in the figure is defined as follows : @xmath66 here , @xmath67 denotes the sm @xmath68 coupling while @xmath69 the non - standard coupling . as it is clear from the plot",
    "the excess occurs when the br@xmath70 times @xmath71 gives about 20% . in the context of the nmssm",
    ", one can explain this excess in two ways .",
    "firstly , a sm - like higgs boson , @xmath72 , can decay dominantly into a pair of @xmath0 s and so the br@xmath73 is suppressed @xcite .",
    "this scenario can relieve the little hierarchy problem but requires that @xmath74 .",
    "( notice that this mass region is currently highly constrained by aleph @xcite and babar @xcite data . ) in fact , there is also another possibility in the nmssm that can explain the lep excess due to the fact that the br(@xmath75 ) can be dominant when the @xmath0 is highly singlet and again , as a result , the br(@xmath76 ) is suppressed even with @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "secondly , a cp - even higgs boson , @xmath78 , has a reduced coupling with @xmath79 0.4 @xcite , due to the mixing between the higgs singlet and doublets .",
    "notice that neither the sm nor the mssm can explain such modest excess , as they have a br@xmath80 which is always dominant , hence yielding an excess much above the experimental limit .",
    "besides , the nmssm could also explain the recent excess observed at the lhc for a higgs mass around 125 gev @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the nmssm has a singlet superfield in addition to the usual higgs doublets of the mssm .",
    "this singlet gives rise to a more varied phenomenology in the case of the nmssm , compared to that of the mssm .",
    "for instance , this singlet superfield mixes with the neutral components of the doublets , giving rise to one cp - even higgs , one cp - odd higgs and one extra neutralino in addition to the usual spectrum of the mssm .",
    "therefore , in the nmssm , by assuming cp - conservation , there are seven higgses : three cp - even , two cp - odd and a pair of charged higgses . we have investigated whether or not at least one higgs boson of the nmssm can be discovered at the lhc ( ` no - lose theorem ' ) and/or is possible to find some regions in the parameter space where more and/or different higgs states of the nmssm are detectable at the lhc , compared to those available within the mssm ( ` more - to - gain theorem ' ) .    because of the mixing between the higgs singlet and doublets , higgs - to - higgs decays are kinematically possible for large regions of the nmssm parameter space even for small masses of the higgs states , which is impossible in the mssm .",
    "for instance , a sm - like higgs can decay into a pair of the lightest nmssm cp - odd higgses .",
    "this decay can be dominant in sizable areas of the nmssm parameter space .",
    "such a decay has a significant meaning if one notices that it can explain a @xmath64 excess occurred at lep for the process @xmath81 for @xmath82@xmath83 gev and the @xmath84 excess recently emerged at the lhc ( primarily in the @xmath85 decay mode ) .",
    "moreover , a sm - like higgs with mass of order 100 gev , which has no - fine tunning , can naturally occur in the nmssm and this scenario is preferred by precision ew data .",
    "in addition , the nmssm can solve both the @xmath5-problem and the little hierarchy problem of the mssm .    in the context of the nmssm",
    ", we have proven that a very light cp - odd higgs state with mass @xmath86 , which has a large singlet component and a small doublet one , can be discovered at the lhc via higgs production in association with a bottom - antibottom pair .",
    "this mode is dominant at large tan@xmath1 . after performing several analyses for signals and dominant backgrounds ,",
    "not documented here yet referred to , we have proven that this production mode is the ideal one to discover the @xmath0 through the following signatures : @xmath87 @xmath88 decay mode , in which @xmath0 can be discovered with mass up to @xmath9 ; @xmath89 @xmath90 decay mode , if @xmath91 gev .",
    "further , despite the fact that the @xmath92 decay mode is dominant in most regions of parameter space that have light @xmath0 , this channel has huge qcd background and a smaller signal - to - background ratio .",
    "finally , we also looked at the detectability of @xmath0 through the @xmath85 decay mode but this proved unuseful despite the fact that this decay mode can be dominant in some areas of the nmssm parameter space .",
    "we believe that the results presented in sections 7 and 8 have a twofold relevance .",
    "firstly , they support the ` no - lose theorem ' by looking for direct @xmath0 production rather than looking for its production through the decays @xmath93 , which may not give a sufficient signal significance .",
    "secondly , they corroborate the ` more - to - gain theorem ' as such very light @xmath0 s ( with @xmath86 ) are not at all possible in the mssm . altogether , the existence of such a light neutral higgs state is a direct evidence for the non - minimal nature of the susy higgs sector .",
    "finally , we have mentioned in section 9 the importance of higgs - to - higgs decays in the nmssm , here occurring after higgs boson production in association with @xmath92 pairs ( unlike in most previous literature ) , and have shown that such decays should be taken seriously before proving , or otherwise , the ` no - lose theorem ' .",
    "in fact , we also have shown that such decays are dominant in sizable regions of the nmssm parameter space .",
    "we have studied the lhc discovery potential of a cp - even higgs boson @xmath78 or @xmath94 , decaying into a pair of light cp - odd higgses @xmath0 s , and also @xmath94 decaying into a pair of @xmath78 s .",
    "we have found that these channels can give sizable signal rates , which could allow one to detect simultaneously two higgs bosons : @xmath78 and @xmath0 , @xmath94 and @xmath0 or @xmath94 and @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the lhc has the potential to discover the three neutral higgs bosons at the same time .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the lhc discovery potential for @xmath78 and @xmath94 decaying into @xmath95 and have shown that , while the discovery of the @xmath78 through this channel is impossible , there is a small but well defined region of the nmssm parameter space where the @xmath94 state could potentially be discovered .",
