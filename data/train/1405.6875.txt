    "the effect of a quenched disorder on critical phenomena is a central topic in equilibrium statistical mechanics . in many cases",
    "it is expected that the presence of impurities in a system _ rounds _ or _ smoothes _ the phase transition in the following sense : the order parameter can be continuous at the phase transition for the disordered system whereas it presents a discontinuity for the pure system ( see e.g. the pioneering work of imri and ma @xcite ) .",
    "an instance for which this phenomenon is rigorously proved is the magnetization transition of the two dimensional random field ising model at low temperature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been particularly studied for the polymer pinning on a defect line ( introduced by fisher in @xcite ) . whereas the model can be defined for a renewal with a distribution tail which is heavier than exponential ( see ) ,",
    "the case of power - law tail has focused most of the attention , due to its physical interpretation and its rich mathematical structure .",
    "the interested reader can refer to @xcite for reviews on the subject .",
    "the smoothing of the free - energy curve for the pinning model with power - law tails was proved in @xcite ( with some restriction on the law of the disorder see @xcite for a recent generalization of the result ; see also @xcite for related models ) .",
    "this confirmed predictions by theoretical physicists @xcite based on an interpretation of the harris criterion @xcite .",
    "some other consequences of the introduction of disorder such as critical point shift were studied in @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims to study how this phenomenology transposes for renewals with a much lighter tail , stretched exponential ones .",
    "whereas this issue does not seem to be discussed much in the literature , it is clear from a mathematical point of view that the type of argument used in @xcite do not extend to that case ( see section [ smoothpol ] for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "this hints to the fact that when renewal tails gets lighter , harris predictions on disorder relevance might not apply ( or at least not in a straightforward manner ) .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case and provide a necessary and sufficient condition on the return exponent for smoothing of the free - energy curve to hold .",
    "let us notice finally notice that renewals with stretched exponential tails have recently been the object of a study by torri @xcite with a different perspective : he focuses on the issue of the scaling limit of the process when the environment is heavy tailed .",
    "let us shortly introduce the model : set @xmath6 to be a renewal process of law @xmath7 , with inter - arrival law @xmath8 , _",

    "4 ) ) , the limit @xmath27 exists and is non - random .",
    "it is non - negative because of assumption and convex in @xmath28 as a limit of convex functions .",
    "the expectation also converges to the same limit @xmath29 the function @xmath30 is called the free - energy ( or sometimes pressure ) of the system .",
    "its derivative in @xmath28 gives the asymptotic contact fraction of the renewal process , i.e.  the mean number of contact per unit length , @xmath31.\\ ] ] the above convergence holds by convexity as soon as @xmath32 is defined ( i.e.  everywhere except eventually at a countable number of points ) . if holds , the system undergoes a phase transition from a de - pinned state ( @xmath33 ) to a pinned one ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) when @xmath28 varies .",
    "we define @xmath36 , the critical point at which this transition occurs @xmath37 as the underlying renewal process @xmath13 is recurrent , we have @xmath38 . from ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.1 ) , the free energy is infinitely differentiable in @xmath28 on @xmath39 ( so that holds everywhere except maybe at the critical point ) .",
    "the phase transition for the pure system , that is , for @xmath40 , is very well understood .",
    "the pure model is said to be exactly solvable and there is a closed expression for @xmath41 in terms of the renewal function @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the disordered system ( @xmath19 ) is much more complicated to analyze and has given rise to a rich literature , most of which devoted to the case where when @xmath42 @xmath43 for some @xmath44 . for the pure model , the free - energy vanishes like a power of @xmath28 at @xmath45 ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.1 ) ) .",
    "@xmath46 for @xmath47 ( a logarithmic correction is present in the case @xmath48 ) .",
    "the main question for the study of disordered pinning model is how this property of the phase transition is affected by the introduction of disorder . for @xmath19 , does there exist @xmath49 such that at the vicinity of @xmath50 @xmath51 if this holds , is @xmath49 equal @xmath52 , like for the pure system ?",
    "a first partial answer to that question was given by giacomin and toninelli @xcite ( or in @xcite with more generality ) where it was shown that @xmath53 meaning that the quenched critical exponent for the free - energy @xmath49 , if its exists , satisfies @xmath54 .",

    "another aspect of the relevance of disorder is the shift of the _ quenched _ critical point with respect to the one .",
    "the annealed critical point is the one corresponding to the phase transition of the annealed partition function obtained by averaging over the environment @xmath61>0\\right\\}=-{\\lambda}({\\beta}).\\ ] ] it follows from jensen s inequality that @xmath62 the question of whether the above inequality is strict was investigated in @xcite yielding the conclusion that @xmath63 for every @xmath19 and @xmath64 .",
    "these results were predicted in the physics literature @xcite , based on an interpretation of the harris criterion @xcite : when the specific - heat exponent of the pure system ( for the pinning model , this exponent is equal to @xmath65 ) is positive , then disorder affects the critical properties of the system and is said to be relevant , whereas when the specific - heat exponent is negative disorder is irrelevant for small values of @xmath56",
    ".    relevant disorder affects both the location of the critical point which is shifted with respect to the annealed bound @xcite , and the critical exponent of the free - energy @xcite .",
    "note that the value of @xmath49 ( and even its existence ) when disorder is relevant is an open question even among physicists ; let us mention the recent work @xcite where heuristics in favor @xmath66 ( infinitely derivable free - energy at the critical point ) are given for a toy - model .    in this paper",
    ", we choose to look at renewal processes whose tails are stretched exponentials , i.e we assume that there exists @xmath67 such that @xmath68 in some sense . as the increments of @xmath13 have finite mean , the transition of the pure model is of first order , meaning that @xmath41 is not derivable at @xmath38 positive recurrent .",

    "2.1 ) one has @xmath69}.\\ ] ] as for the case @xmath70 in .",
    "hence a standard interpretation of the harris criterion would tell us that disorder should be relevant for every @xmath56 .",
    "this is partially true in the sense that this conclusion is right if one considers only the question of the critical point shift .",
    "the method developed in @xcite can be adapted almost in a straightforward manner to show that    [ mook ] when @xmath71 has stretched - exponential tails , then for all @xmath19 , @xmath72    the more challenging question is the one about the order of the phase transition .",
    "indeed the smoothing inequality proved in @xcite strongly relies of the fact that @xmath8 has a power - law tail .",
    "we are in fact able to find a necessary and sufficient condition on @xmath3 for a smoothing inequality to hold : we prove that when @xmath4 , the transition remains of first order for the disordered system , while for @xmath5 the transition is rounded .",
    "we also give upper and lower bounds , which do not coincide , on the exponent @xmath49 , informally defined in , when rounding occurs , in particular we show that for any value of @xmath67 , the disordered phase transition remains of finite order .",
    "we assume here and in what follows that there exist a constant @xmath73 and @xmath2 which is such that @xmath74 the law @xmath71 as well as the law of @xmath75 are considered to be fixed , and constants that are mentioned throughout the proof can depend on both .",
    "unless it is specified , they will not depend on @xmath56 and @xmath28 .    for our first result",
    ", we need to assume that the law of our product environment satisfies a concentration inequality .",
    "we say that @xmath76 is lipschitz if for some @xmath77 if    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the euclidean norm .",

    "this is the reason why we use concentration for the euclidean norm rather than for the @xmath86 norm .",
    "the concentration assumption is not very restrictive , it holds for bounded @xmath75 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) ) , or when @xmath75 satisfies a @xmath87-sobolev inequality ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) in this case there is no convexity required ) .",

    "we say that @xmath71 is @xmath87 convex if @xmath100 can be extended to a convex function on @xmath101 ; or equivalently if one has @xmath102 this assumption is necessary to prove positive correlation , or the fkg inequality ( see @xcite ) for the disordered renewal .",

    "let us explain briefly in this section why the strategy from @xcite fails to give any results in the case of stretched exponential renewals ( for more details the reader should refer to the original article ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume here that the environment is gaussian and that @xmath107 .",
    "the main idea in @xcite is the following .",
    "let @xmath108 be fixed , and @xmath82 be chosen very large .",
    "we look at a system at the critical point @xmath36 ( for which the free energy is zero ) : in a typical segment of length @xmath82 the empirical mean of @xmath75 should be of order @xmath109 due to the law of large number ; however , with probability of order @xmath110 the empirical mean is larger than @xmath111 . in that case",
    ", the system does not locally look critical and the partition function corresponding to the segment should be of order @xmath112 , if @xmath82 is chosen sufficiently large to avoid finite size effects .",
    "the distance between these segments of length @xmath82 which give an unusually `` good '' contribution to the partition function should be typically huge , that is , of order @xmath113 , and thus the cost for making a huge jump between two consecutive good segments to avoid bad environment should be of order @xmath114 . as the free - energy at criticality is zero , the strategy consisting in visiting all the `` good '' segments and avoiding all the bad ones should not give an exponentially large contribution to the partition function , hence the cost of making the large jump should completely compensate for the energy reward one gets when visiting a good segment .",
    "for this reason one must have for sufficiently large @xmath82    @xmath115    in the case where @xmath0 has a power - law tail , this immediately yields a quadratic bound on the free energy . however , when @xmath0 has a lighter tail , fails to give any interesting information , as @xmath114 decays super - exponentially .",
    "some elements of this strategy can somehow be recycled ( this is what is done in section [ seclwb ] ) if one has some information about the behavior of finite volume systems ( see lemma [ finitevol ] ) .",
    "however , as will be seen , this fails to give a quadratic bound on the free - energy .",
    "an other instance of pinning model with absence of smoothing has been exhibited in @xcite : disordered pinning of transient renewals with exponential tails ( the case @xmath116 for some @xmath117 ) .",
    "however , let us mention that this is case quite special since when the tail of the renewal is exponential remark [ rembc ] is not valid anymore .",
    "on the contrary , the behavior of the system crucially depends on the contraint one imposes at the end point :    * the free - energy @xmath118 defined by , which corresponds to a system constrained to be pinned , is negative for small values of @xmath28 . *",
    "the free energy of the system with no constraints is obtained by considering the best of two strategies : either the walk will avoid the wall completely or it will try to pin the end point . the reward for this is equal to @xmath119 , which is easily shown to have a first order transition in @xmath28 .    here the mechanism which triggers a first order phase transition is completely different : one has to perform an analysis of the local fluctuations of the environment to see whether or not the benefit of a good rare region is sufficient to compensate the cost of a large jump reaching it .",
