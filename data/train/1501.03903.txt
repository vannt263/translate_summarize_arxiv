    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions generate not only extremely hot quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) but also extremely large magnetic fields due to the fast motion of the colliding ions .",
    "recent detailed calculations revealed that the maximum magnetic fields in au + au collisions at energies currently available at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) can reach @xmath8 gauss while in pb + pb collisions at energies available at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) they can reach @xmath9 gauss  @xcite . under such large magnetic fields , some novel quantum phenomena can possibly happen .",
    "the most intriguing ones are the so - called chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite and chiral separation effect ( cse )  @xcite : they occur in parity- and charge - odd regions in qgp and can result in charge and chirality separations along the direction of the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "recent experimental measurements of the charge azimuthal correlation  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the emission azimuthal angles of particles with charges @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the reaction plane angle , showed some consistent features with the expectation of cme at both rhic and lhc energies  @xcite",
    ". another important experimental test of cme and cse is the observation of the charge asymmetry in the elliptic flow of pions  @xcite that is consistent with the expectation of a chiral magnetic wave ( cmw )  @xcite  a collective mode arising due to the interplay between cme and cse in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "however , one must notice that there are other backgrounds that contribute to the experimental observables , see refs .",
    "@xcite for discussions .",
    "heavy - ion collisions can also generate strong electric fields due to the event - by - event fluctuation of the proton positions in the ions  @xcite or due to asymmetric colliding geometry ( for example , in cu + au collisions  @xcite ) .",
    "it was proposed that the electric fields may also induce chiral current and chiral separation in qgp , which is called the chiral electric separation effect ( cese )  @xcite .",
    "it was also proposed that the cu+au collisions may provide us a good chance to detect cese because there is a strong electric field directing from au to cu due to the charge asymmetry between au and cu nuclei  @xcite .",
    "recently , the electromagnetic fields in cu + au collisions were studied in details , and it was found that the large in - plane charge separation effect ( in - plane cse ) induced by the strong in - plane electric fields could strongly suppress or even reverse signs of @xmath16  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose two observables that are designed solely for the detection of cese .",
    "in addition , it is crucial to take the final state interactions into account for any model calculations in order to link the initial anomalous transports to the experimental data since heavy - ion collisions undergo complicated dynamical evolutions which involve many final interactions .",
    "we study the effects of the final state interactions by using a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model which successfully describes the main evolution stages of heavy - ion collisions . by introducing appropriate initial dipolar or quadrupole charge distributions ,",
    "the ampt model can successfully describe both the charge azimuthal correlation @xmath16  @xcite and the charge asymmetry of the pion elliptic flow  @xcite in au + au collisions at the top rhic energy . in this work ,",
    "we introduce different kinds of initial charge separations which are used to mimic different initial chiral effects into the initial condition of the ampt model , and predict some observables which can be used to test whether these effects can be observed in the final state of cu+au collisions at @xmath17 = 200 gev .",

    "the ampt model with a string melting scenario is utilized in this work  @xcite .",
    "the ampt model is a dynamical transport model which consists of four main components : initial condition , parton cascade , hadronization , and hadronic rescatterings .",
    "the initial condition , which includes the spatial and momentum distribution of participant matter , minijet partons production and soft string excitations , is obtained through the hijing model  @xcite .",
    "the parton cascade starts the partonic evolution with a quark - anti - quark plasma from the melting of strings .",
    "parton scatterings are modelled by zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) , which currently only includes two - body elastic parton scatterings using cross sections from pqcd with screening masses  @xcite .",
    "the parton interaction cross section is set as 10 mb in our work , by which the model has shown good abilities to describe many key experimental observables at rhic  @xcite . a quark coalescence model is then used to combine partons into hadrons when the system freezes out .",
    "the evolution dynamics of the hadronic matter is described by a relativistic transport ( art ) model  @xcite . because the current implementation of the art model does not conserve the electric charge",
    ", we in this study consider only resonance decays and hadronic scatterings are switched off to ensure the charge conservation .",
    "let us consider the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) in cu + cu collisions first .",
    "this can serve as a test of the ampt model .",
    "the coordinate system is set up so that the @xmath19-axis is in the reaction plane , i.e. , @xmath20 , and the @xmath21-axis is perpendicular to the reaction plane with the @xmath22-axis being the direction of the projectile nucleus . to mimic the cme",
    ", we introduce an initial charge separation into the initial state of the ampt model , since the charges are not separated but distributed randomly in the normal ampt model . to separate a percentage of the initial charges ,",
    "we follow the procedure of a global charge separation scenario , which has been employed in ma and zhang s previous work  @xcite .",
    "we switch a percentage of the downward moving @xmath23 quarks with those of the upward moving @xmath24 quarks in such a way that the total momentum is conserved , and likewise for @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks , where the percentage should presumably depend on the impact parameter @xmath27 or centrality , because the magnitude of the averaged magnetic field is @xmath27 dependent .     in cu+cu collisions at @xmath17=200 gev .",
    "the open symbols represent the results from the normal ampt model without anomalous effects and the ampt model with an initial cme - like charge separation , and the solid symbols represent the experimental data  @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig - cucu ] we show our ampt results of the charge azimuthal correlation @xmath16 ( from the normal ampt model and the ampt model with the initial cme - like charge separation ) as well as the experimental data for cu+cu collisions at @xmath17 = 200 gev .",
    "we find that , to fit the cu+cu experimental data , the percentage of initial cme - like charge separation @xmath28 should be proportional to the impact parameter @xmath27 with a slope of 1.56 , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the averaged magnetic field is proportional to @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "comparing with the normal ampt result , the ampt result with the initial cme - like charge separation can well describe cu+cu data measured by the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) experiment .",
    "we now turn to study the cu + au systems .",
    "the coordinate system of cu + au is set up similarly to that of cu+cu , but the au nucleus is set to the left of the cu nucleus , i.e. , the direction of the total electric field is rightward .",
    "figures  [ fig - changedis ] ( a)-(f ) show the net electric charge distributions in the transverse momentum space of the initial partonic states in the ampt models with different kinds of initial charge separations for centrality bin of 30 - 40% in cu+au collisions",

    "it is consistent with the previous ampt works about au+au collisions  @xcite and the above results about cu+cu collisions .",
    "if the initial charges are separated along the reaction plane direction [ mimicking the in - plane charge separation effect ( in - plane cse ) caused by the strong in - plane electric field ] , comparing with the cme case , opposite - charge and same - charge correlations reverse their signs , i.e. a negative opposite - charge correlation and a positive same - charge correlation are observed and their magnitudes are comparable to the cu+cu data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - cos ] ( c ) .",
    "this result is consistent with recent study in ref .",
    "@xcite and more discussions can be found there .",
    "it is also consistent with the charge asymmetry of direct flow @xmath36 suggested in ref .  @xcite . if the chiral electric separation effect ( cese ) , cme , and in - plane cse happen together in the initial stage [ fig .  [ fig - cos ] ( d ) ] , both the opposite - charge and same - charge correlations are strongly suppressed to the levels close to the normal ampt model [ fig .",
    "[ fig - cos ] ( a ) ] , which indicates the three effects almost cancel out .",

    "if the initial strength of the cme - like charge separation gets larger , e.g. if it is doubled ( denoted as cese+2@xmath43cme+in - plane cse ) , the magnitudes for both opposite - charge and same - charge correlations are between those for the cme and for cese+cme+in - plane cse , which is shown in fig .",

    "[ illu ] for illustration ] , suppose the positive charges fly out along the azimuthal angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the negative charges fly out along @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath48 is a deformation angle due to the cese effect",
    ". thus @xmath52 should be in general different from @xmath53 .",
    "on the other hand , for purely dipolar charge distribution ( due to the in - plane cse or due to the cme ) , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the dipolar angle ( @xmath56 for in - plane dipole and @xmath57 for out - of - plane dipole ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 , the difference between @xmath58 and @xmath44 , can be an observable for the cese since the in - plane cse or the cme does not contribute to it .",
    "in real experiments , the dominant background of @xmath59 may be the elliptic flow @xmath60 because , if we turn off all the anomalous effects , @xmath61 .",
    "another background may be the transverse momentum conservation  @xcite which causes a contribution @xmath62 with @xmath63 the fourth harmonic flow and @xmath64 the multiplicity . in @xmath65 these charge - blind @xmath60 and @xmath63 backgrounds",
    "are subtracted .",
    "however , there may remain other backgrounds , for example , due to the local charge conservation  @xcite ( which leads to @xmath66 and @xmath67 and thus @xmath68 ) or due to the chiral magnetic wave induced quadrupole . because we do not encode these effects into our ampt model , the following result is supposed not to be related to the local charge conservation and chiral magnetic wave . in fig .",
    "[ fig - cos2 ] we present the centrality dependence of @xmath69 in cu + au collisions from three different initial settings in the ampt model .",
    "one can see that the normal ampt case and the cme can not yield a visible signal for all centrality bins , while the result for cese+cme+in - plane cese case shows an increasing trend of @xmath69 from central to peripheral cu+au collisions , where the signal becomes very clear in the most peripheral centrality bin .",
    ", for six initial settings of ampt models in cu+au collisions at @xmath17=200 gev . ]",
    "as discussed above , the chiral electric separation effect ( cese ) combined with the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) can lead to a quadrupolar charge distributions in cu + au collisions , see fig .",
    "[ illu ] . therefore , we propose another observable for cese : @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the second harmonic angles of the event planes reconstructed by final positively charged hadrons and negatively charged hadrons .",
    "if we follow the above assumption for the cese , then @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - psidiff ] we show the centrality dependence of @xmath74 for six different initial settings of the ampt model in cu+au collisions .",
    "as we expected , once the cese happens , it leads to a sizable @xmath74 which shows a linear dependence on the centrality .",
    "more importantly , for those initial settings which do not include the cese , we do not observe a nonzero @xmath75 for the whole centrality window .",
    "it should be mentioned that our results are based on the fact that in each event we know which side is the au nucleus and which side is the cu nucleus in the transverse plane , i.e. the direction of the electric field . in real experiments , it becomes very complex to identify the relative locations of au and cu and one has to reconstruct the first harmonic event plane in order to distinguish the au side from the cu side , which will be hopefully achieved by using some event plane detectors such as zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) in future experiments .",
    "in summary , we have introduced various initial charge separation effects , including the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) , in - plane charge separation effect ( in - plane cse ) , and chiral electric separation effect ( cese ) , into the ampt model to study how the final state interactions render the initial charge separation effects.to distinguish these initial effects , three possible observables are tested in cu+au collisions at @xmath17=200 gev .",
    "the charge azimuthal correlation @xmath76 is sensitive to the cme and the in - plane cse but not to the cese .",
    "the cme results in a positive opposite - charge correlation and a negative same - charge correlation , while the in - plane cse reverse their signs relative to those for the cme case . however , the @xmath77 is an observable that is sensitive to the cese but not sensitive to cme and in - plane cse which makes it be a possible observable for the detection of cese .",
    "the difference between the second harmonic angles of event planes reconstructed by final positive - charge hadrons or negative - charge hadrons , @xmath78 , is also sensitive to the cese and is sizable in very peripheral cu+au collisions . we thus propose that future experiments can take advantage of cu + au collisions to measure these observables in order to identify or distinguish different chiral and charge separation mechanisms .",
