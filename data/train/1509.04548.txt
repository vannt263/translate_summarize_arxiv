    "basic principles of the radiation transfer theory were formulated in the seminal paper of schuster @xcite as early as the beginning of the @xmath1th century .",
    "the paper @xcite was devoted to the light propagation in a foggy atmosphere .",
    "since then the schuster approach has obtained many applications in such important fields as astronomy , laser communication and radar systems , remote sensing etc .",
    "the range and performance of light communication systems are limited significantly by an unfavorable influence of local fluctuations of the refractive index of the earth atmosphere . on the other hand",
    ", high sensitivity of the photon trajectories to the fluctuations can be used for the atmosphere diagnostics @xcite .",
    "the key issue about the index - of - refraction structure constant @xmath2 is that it can not be reliably computed from first principles .",
    "the refractive - index fluctuations arise from temperature inhomogeneities of the air .",
    "the inhomogeneities cause turbulent eddies which give rise to a random distribution of the air density(@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "this results in random spatial variations of the refractive index .",
    "the turbulent eddies are described by a wide range of characteristic lengths of inhomogeneities .",
    "these lengths cover the interval from few millimeters ( the inner radius , @xmath3 ) to hundred meters ( the outer radius , @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , various types of beam scattering are observed . the scattering by large - size eddies results in random redirections of the beam as a whole .",
    "this process is known in the literature as a `` wandering '' or `` dancing '' of the beam @xcite,@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the scattering by small - size eddies causes spreading of the beam . for a long - distance propagation or a strong turbulence , the beam radius becomes greater than the characteristic sizes of the inhomogeneities . in this case",
    "the probability of the beam to be redirected becomes small and the relative value of the wandering radius decreases @xcite .",
    "the beam wandering and broadening can be considered as the specific manifestations of a more general phenomenon , namely the intensity fluctuations ( i.e. scintillations ) caused by the atmosphere turbulence .",
    "the scintillations have a tendency of saturating for a long - distance propagation @xcite,@xcite ( the regime of a strong turbulence ) .",
    "this is because in the course of propagation the radiation acquires the properties of the gaussian statistics when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) tends to unity .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the scintillation index , @xmath5 , was explained in refs .",
    "moreover , it was shown quite generally that this property stays unchanged for any refractive index distribution , provided the response time of the recording instrument is short compared with the source coherence time .",
    "this result was confirmed analytically in @xcite .    at the same time ,",
    "calculations , performed by different methods in @xcite and @xcite , show a possibility of significant suppression of the scintillations . to this end",
    "partially coherent laser beams with the coherence time shorter than the detector integration time ( a slow detector ) can be used .",
    "the case of a partial coherence was also studied in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental developments on propagation of partially coherent beams in a turbulent atmosphere were discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are several analytical approaches explaining behavior of the scintillation index in the case of strong turbulence @xcite .",
    "their analysis is based on the physical picture where four waves , forming the second moment of the intensity , conserve only pair correlations in course of long - distance propagation .",
    "two different pairs of the photon trajectories contribute into the square of the photon density at the detector .",
    "dashen used the feynman path integrals to prove that in a convincing manner @xcite .",
    "the recent interest to beam propagation was awakened by the development of quantum communication in the free atmosphere @xcite , @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the effect of the turbulence - induced losses on the quantum state of the light in the course of satellite - mediated communication and for realization of the entanglement transfer in the atmosphere were reported in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the formalism of the photon distribution function ( the photon density in the coordinate - momentum space @xcite ) , is also applicable to the problem of scintillations @xcite .",
    "the mentioned papers are based on a physical picture , which is similar to the described above .",
    "the method of photon distribution function is used for description of both the classical and the quantum light including propagation of single - photon pulses ( see , for example , refs .",
    "solution of the kinetic equation for the operator of photon density is based on the method of characteristics .",
    "the assumption of weak disturbances of photon momenta by the atmosphere ( the paraxial approximation ) reduces the problems of scintillations to the problem of obtaining photon trajectories and their correlations .",
    "a slowly varying fluctuating force , deflecting photon trajectories from straight lines , describes the effect of the atmospheric eddies .    in this work",
    "we study the scintillation index for moderate and strong turbulences , when correlation of trajectories of only two photons is required .",
    "accuracy of the calculations depends on the accuracy of obtaining the trajectories . using high - order iterations and bringing together analytical and numerical procedures",
    ", we calculate the scintillation index .",
    "our main interest is to analyze the range of moderate turbulence strengths where previous theories do not ensure a reliable description .",
    "comparison of the obtained results with those represented in @xcite helps indicate the range of turbulence where a simplified approach should be corrected by high - order iterations . also , our studies describe more realistically the effect of partial coherence .",
    "the photon distribution function is defined by analogy with distribution functions in solid state physics . in particular , it is similar to the phonon distribution function . both of them are defined as @xcite,@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators of photons or phonons with the momenta @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the normalizing volume .",
    "polarization of the corresponding modes is not specified in ( [ threee ] ) . in the paraxial approximation , assumed here ,",
