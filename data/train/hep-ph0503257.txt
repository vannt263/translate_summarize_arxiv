    "in the last few years , an avalanche of new cosmological data has revolutionized our ability to measure key cosmological parameters .",
    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galaxy clustering , gravitational lensing , the lyman alpha forest , cluster abundances and type ia supernovae paint a consistent picture where the cosmic matter budget is about 5% ordinary matter , 25% dark matter , 70% dark energy , less than 1% curvature and less than 5% massive neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the cosmic initial conditions are consistent with approximately scale - invariant inflation - produced adiabatic fluctuations , with no evidence yet for primordial gravitational waves @xcite .    how precisely do such cosmological observations give us information about neutrino masses , and how should the current limits be interpreted ?",
    "for detailed discussion of post - wmap astrophysical neutrino constraints , see @xcite and in particular the excellent and up - to - date reviews @xcite . for a review of the theoretical and experimental situation , see @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this symposium contribution is merely to provide a brief summary of the constraints and the underlying physics at a level appropriate for readers outside of the field of cosmology .",
    "=    why do cosmological observations place strong bounds on neutrino masses ?",
    "the short answer is that neutrinos affect the growth of cosmic clustering and this clustering can be accurately measured ( ) .",
    "the cmb tells us that the universe used to be almost perfectly uniform spatially , with density variations from place to place only at the level of @xmath3 .",
    "gravitational instability caused these tiny density fluctuations to grow in amplitude into the galaxies and the large - scale structure that we observe around us today .",
    "the reason for this growth is simply that gravity is an attractive force : if the density at some point exceeds the mean density by some relative amount @xmath4 , then mass will be pulled in from surrounding regions and @xmath4 increases over time .",
    "a classic result is that if all the matter contributing to the cosmic density is able to cluster ( like dark matter or ordinary matter with negligible pressure ) , then fluctuations grow as the cosmic scale factor @xmath5 @xcite : a , , fluctuations double in amplitude every time the universe doubles it linear size @xmath5 .",
    "if some fraction of the matter density is gravitationally inert and unable to cluster , the fluctuation growth will clearly be slower .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath6 can cluster , then is generalized to @xcite : a^p , where p = -14_*^3/5 and the approximation in the last step is surprisingly accurate .",
    "such gravitationally inert components can include dark energy and ( on sufficiently small scales ) photons and neutrinos .",
    "early on , the cosmic density was completely dominated by photons , so @xmath7 and fluctuations essentially did not start growing until the epoch of matter - domination ( md ) . at recent times , the cosmic density has become dominated by dark energy @xmath8 , causing fluctuations to gradually stop growing after a net growth factor of about @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "massive nonrelativistic neutrinos are unable to cluster on small scales because of their high velocities . between matter domination and dark energy domination , they constitute a roughly constant fraction @xmath10 of the matter density . therefore gives a net fluctuation growth factor ( a_a_md)^p4700^p4700^(1-)^3/54700 e^-4 from matter - domination ( md ) until today , where we have assumed @xmath11 in the last step .",
    "we see that the basic reason that a small neutrino fraction has a large effect is simply that @xmath12 is a large number , so that a small change in the exponent @xmath13 makes a noticeable difference .",
    "a key point to remember is that what mattered above was the neutrino @xmath14 , specifically the fractional contribution @xmath15 of neutrinos to the total density . to translate observational constraints on the neutrino mass density into constraints on neutrino masses , we need to know the neutrino number density . assuming that this number density is determined by standard model neutrino freezeout gives a number density around 112/@xmath16 and @xcitehe abundance inconsistent with that observed . ] , where _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 m_^i is the sum of the three neutrino masses and @xmath17 is the measured matter density in units of @xmath18kg@xmath19m@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath21 shown in is the variance of the fluctuations @xmath4 in fourier space , so massive neutrinos suppress it by the same factor as it suppresses @xmath22 , , by a factor @xcite : e^-8 .",
    "this means that a neutrino mass sum @xmath23 cuts the power roughly in half on the small scales where neutrinos can not cluster .",
    "the length scale below which neutrino clustering is strongly suppressed is called the neutrino free - streaming scale , and roughly corresponds to the distance neutrinos have time to travel while the universe expands by a factor of two . intuitively , neutrinos clearly will not cluster in an overdense clump so small that its escape velocity is much smaller than the typical neutrino velocity . on scales",
    "much larger than the free - streaming scale , on the other hand , neutrinos cluster just as cold dark matter and give @xmath24 and @xmath25 above .",
    "this explains the effect of neutrinos on the power spectrum seen in : suppression only on small scales , thereby changing the overall shape of @xmath21 in a characteristic way .",
    "this shape change distinguishes the neutrino effect from that of dark energy , which lowers @xmath6 and hence the power spectrum amplitude on _ all _ scales by the same factor , preserving the shape of @xmath21 .",
    "=    cosmological observations have thus far produced no convincing detection of neutrino mass , but strong upper limits as illustrated in .",
    "this figure shows that the wmap cmb - measurements alone @xcite tell us almost nothing about neutrino masses and are consistent with neutrinos making up 100% of the dark matter .",
    "rather , the power of wmap is that it constrains other cosmological parameters so strongly that it enables large - scale structure data to measure the small - scale @xmath21-suppression that massive neutrinos cause .",
    "combining wmap with sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite galaxy clustering measurements @xcite gives the most favored value @xmath26 and the 95% upper limit @xmath27ev @xcite . including information about sdss or 2dfgrs @xcite galaxy bias tightens this bound to @xmath28 ev @xcite .",
    "including sdss measurements of the so - called lyman @xmath29 forest ( intergalactic gas backlit by quasars ) further tightens the bound to @xmath30 ev ( 95% ) .",
    "these upper limits are complemented by the lower limit from neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "atmospheric neutrino oscillations show that there is at least one neutrino ( presumably mostly a linear combination of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) whose mass exceeds a lower limit around @xmath33ev @xcite .",
    "thus the atmospheric neutrino data corresponds to a lower limit @xmath34 , or @xmath35 .",
    "the solar neutrino oscillations occur at a still smaller mass scale , perhaps around @xmath36ev @xcite .",
    "these mass - splittings are substantially smaller than 0.42 ev , suggesting that all three mass eigenstates would need to be almost degenerate for neutrinos to weigh in near our upper limit . since sterile neutrinos are disfavored from being thermalized in the early universe",
    "@xcite , it can be assumed that only three neutrino flavors are present in the neutrino background ; this means that none of the three neutrinos can weigh more than about @xmath37 ev .",
    "the mass of the heaviest neutrino is thus in the range @xmath38 ev .    a caveat about non - standard neutrinos is in order .",
    "as mentioned above , the cosmological constraints to first order probe only the _ mass density _ of neutrinos , @xmath39 , which determines the small - scale power suppression factor , and the _ velocity dispersion _ , which determines the scale below which the suppression occurs .",
    "for the low mass range we have discussed , the neutrino velocities are high and the suppression occurs on all scales where sdss is highly sensitive .",
    "we thus measure only the neutrino mass density , and our conversion of this into a limit on the mass sum assumes that the neutrino number density is known and given by the standard model freezeout calculation . in more general scenarios with sterile or otherwise non - standard neutrinos where the freezeout abundance is different , the conclusion to take away is an upper limit on the total light neutrino mass density of @xmath40kg / m@xmath20 ( 95% ) . to test arbitrary nonstandard models",
    ", a future challenge will be to independently measure both the mass density and the velocity dispersion , and check whether they are both consistent with the same value of @xmath41 .",
    "although cosmological neutrino bounds have recently improved dramatically , there is ample room for further improvement in the near and intermediate future .",
    "the basic reason for this is that the weakest link in current constraints is their dependence on other cosmological parameters .",
    "for instance , the galaxy clustering constraints can not directly exploit the dramatic effect of neutrinos on the _ amplitude _ of the small - scale power spectrum shown in , merely the slight change in its _ shape _ , and this shape change can be partially mimicked by changing other cosmological parameters such as the spectral index from inflation which effectively tilts the @xmath21 .",
    "the reason for this shortcoming is that galaxy surveys do not measure the clustering amplitude of matter directly , merely the clustering amplitude of luminous matter ( galaxies ) , which is known to differ by a constant factor that is measured empirically .",
    "weak gravitational lensing bypasses this shortcoming .",
    "light from distant galaxies or cmb patterns is deflected in a measurable way by the gravitational pull of _ all _ intervening matter , regardless whether it is luminous or dark , baryonic or non - baryonic , allowing the matter power spectrum @xmath21 to be measured in a clean assumption - free way .",
    "this booming field has the potential to attain a neutrino mass sensitivity of 0.03 ev or better @xcite .",
    "since the lower bound from atmospheric neutrino oscillations is around 0.05 ev , upcoming cosmological measurements should detect neutrino mass if the technical and fiscal challenges can be met .",
