    "in the study of ultracold gases it is very important to understand the low - energy scattering properties of atoms .",
    "first , the two - body and three - body collisions are the underlying physics of many important experimental phenomena , e.g. , the two - body decay and three - body recombination .",
    "second , understanding the behavior of the low - energy inter - atomic scattering amplitudes is indispensable in designing the effective inter - atomic interactions ( e.g. , the huang - yang pseudo - potential  @xcite , bethe - peierls boundary condition  @xcite and the contact interaction with momentum cutoff  @xcite ) , which are widely used in the theoretical calculations . in the low - energy cases the effective interaction and the realistic interaction potential should lead to the same two - body scattering amplitude .    in recent years",

    "the atomic spin is linearly coupled with the aotmic spatial momentum",
    ". a considerable amount of theoretical interest has been stimulated to understand the so - coupling effect in both many - body  @xcite and few - body physics  fewbody1,fewbody2,fewbody3,fewbody4,fewbody5,fewbody6,fewbody7,fewbody8 , fewbody0,ourbp , duan , fewbody9 .    in this paper",
    "we provide a systematic investigation on the two - body scattering amplitude of so - coupled ultracold atoms in three - dimensional ( 3d ) uniform space .",
    "our research is based on the following motivations .",
    "first , in the current experiments , the amplitude of elastic interatomic collision nist_partial and inelastic - scattering - induced decay nist_partial , ourdecay of ultracold gases have been directly observed in the systems with so coupling .",
    "the theoretical investigation for the two - body scattering amplitude is necessary to explain this kind of observations .",
    "in particular , the calculation of the inelastic scattering amplitudes is crucial for the study of stability of the so - coupled ultracold gases in the metastable dressed state , e.g. , the dark state .",
    "second , as shown above , the criteria of the effective interaction in the ultracold gases is that , the effective interaction potential and the real interaction potential should lead to the same low - energy two - body scattering amplitude .",
    "accordingly , we should first calculate the scattering amplitude given by the real potential , and then construct the correct effective interactions .",
    "this kind of work has been done for ultracold gases in quasi - one - dimensional  @xcite , quasi - two - dimensional  @xcite confinements and optical lattices  @xcite , but it is still absent for the gases with so coupling .",
    "the calculation in this paper is based on our recent work @xcite where the short - range behavior of the scattering wave functions of two so - coupled ultracold atoms in a 3d uniform system is studied and a modified bethe - peierls boundary condition is derived .",
    "based on these results , in this paper we derive an analytical expression for the scattering amplitude of two atoms with arbitrary spin and so coupling . our approach can also be used to calculate the low - energy bound state of two spin-@xmath0 atoms with so coupling .",
    "furthermore , we show that the so coupling can induce the scattering resonance .",
    "namely , for the atoms with finite scattering length , the threshold scattering amplitude diverges when the so - coupling intensity assumes some particular value . for the so - coupled spin-@xmath0 fermonic atoms",
    ", we also derive the renormalization relation of 3d and pure - two - dimensional ( pure-2d ) effective contact interaction with momentum cutoff , as well as the applicability of huang - yang pseudo - potential .",
    "we find that the form of the 3d and 2d renormalization relation is not changed by the so coupling .",
    "nevertheless , in the presence of so coupling the physical parameters , i.e. , the scattering length in the 3d case and bound - state binding energy in 2d case , should be replaced by the ones which are related to the so coupling .",
    "furthermore , we also find that the huang - yang pseudo - potential can not be directly used in the presence of so - coupling .",
