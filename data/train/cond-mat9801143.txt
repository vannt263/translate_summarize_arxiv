    "compact and regular two dimensional arrangements of oxycyanine dye bound to hydrophobic carbon tails show remarkably narrow absorption and fluorescence peaks [ 1 - 5 ] . in these so called j - aggregates",
    "it is believed that the excitation of a dye molecule becomes delocalized ( exciton ) due to the strong dipole - dipole interactions between delocalized electrons in adjacent dye molecules .",
    "it was also shown [ 3 - 5 ] that these structures can support practically loss - free energy transport over large distances .",
    "molecules of a suitable acceptor ( a molecule similar to that used in j - aggregate , but with thiocyanine instead of oxycyanine ) were able to absorb almost all the energy , even at concentrations as low as 1:10 000 .",
    "it is , however , astonishing , that energy transport is more efficient when the coupling to the acceptor is weak [ 5 ] .",
    "quantum mechanical mechanism of this effect was developed in [ 7,8 ] in terms of exciton trapping by shallow bound state of large spatial extend .",
    "however , the theory assumed ideal excitons , which would imply extremely small absorption width in j - aggregate . clearly a dissipation mechanism is needed to explain the observed experimentally absorption width , which , moreover , should not destroy the delicate exciton trapping needed to explain long range energy transport .",
    "investigation of possible dissipation mechanisms is the aim of this paper .",
    "it will be shown that the usually assumed [ 6 ] exciton - phonon coupling is not up to the task and that only a mechanism destroying excitons will do .",
    "we propose , therefore , a new phonon - exciton interaction , which has the required properties and , moreover , leads to a solvable model .",
    "then we demonstrate that our interaction permits a long range energy transfer in two dimensional structures .",
    "we start with the one dimensional hamiltonian for the excitons [ 6,7 ] .",
    "we have    @xmath0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of an excitation at site n , @xmath3 is the excitation energy of a single dye molecule and j is the resonant interaction energy between adjacent sites .",
    "we use one dimensional formalism for simplicity s sake , two dimensional generalization is immediate .",
    "hamiltonian ( 1 ) is diagonalized in momentum space .",
    "introducing bloch waves with quasi momentum k we have    @xmath4    our hamiltonian ( 1 ) is now    @xmath5    with the dispersion relation    @xmath6    again for simplicity we use scalar photons with the coupling to the dye within rotating wave approximation [ 8 ] , so the hamiltonian for the exciton - photon system is    @xmath7    where the second integral is the energy of the photons with the usual dispersion relation    @xmath8    and the last term is the photon - exciton interaction . note that the sum of exciton and phonon numbers is conserved ( by the virtue of rotating wave approximation ) and that we have delta of momentum conservation along the chain . at the momenta of interest",
    "the molecular formfactor @xmath9 is practically a constant , which we denote @xmath10 , and its momentum dependence is of importance in loop integrals only : it gives the natural line width of an atomic state , much smaller than the experimentally observed width [ 8 ] .",
    "it is important to realize that since the wavelength of visible light is of the order 1000   , this corresponds to momenta of the order @xmath11 @xmath12 , so to a good approximation light produces excitons with negligible momentum , i.e. from the bottom of the band . in this form",
    "the model is analytically solvable . working within one photon - one exciton sector",
    "we use for the wave function the ansatz    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the fock vacuum ( which is an exact eigenstate of the theory ) .",
    "this leads to a system of equations for the unknown functions @xmath15 and @xmath16    @xmath17    where the photon wavefunction @xmath16 is a sum of plane and scattered wave    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the momentum of the incoming light . system ( 9 ) is easily solved and we get for the experimentally observed photon wavefunction    @xmath20    as we see , the scattered wave has a cylindrical outgoing wave ( note the one dimensional delta function ) multiplied by scattering amplitude .",
    "the absorption intensity is proportional therefore to    @xmath21    where we have introduced the notation    @xmath22    for small @xmath23 ( our case ) the real part of @xmath24 is negligible , while the imaginary part is    @xmath25    the absorption probability has therefore the familiar lorentzian shape    @xmath26    due to the smallness of @xmath10 [ 8 ] , the absorption peak has a finite , albeit very small with . in order to get a more realistic value , we need a dissipation mechanism , i.e. interaction with phonons .",
    "like everybody else we assume that excitons interact with phonons , since the j - aggregate structure is not very stiff .",
    "we take the phonon hamiltonian in the familiar form    @xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the ( bosonic ) creation and annihilation operators for phonons with the dispersion relation    @xmath30    one usually assumes a trilinear coupling exciton - phonon [ 6 ]    @xmath31    however , this coupling does not change the exciton number : this interaction can only push excitons to the bottom of the band , but never destroy them ! since excitons are created with negligible momentum anyway , this mechanism , although certainly present , can not contribute significantly to the observed light absorption width .",
    "we need therefore an interaction which will explicitly destroy excitons , regardless their energy .",
    "the simplest possibility is the annihilation of an exciton into 2 phonons .",
    "after all , the excited dye molecule contains a delocalized electron , which can not only reradiate light , but also give up its energy to the vibrations of the whole structure .",
    "we of course realize that it is difficult for two phonons to carry away 2 - 3  ev of energy , so we call them effective. we therefore propose the interaction in the form    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the formfactor , which , for the sake of simplicity , we assume is constant .",
    "our interaction has the great advantage that it leads to a solvable model .",
    "our excitons coupled to photons and phonons are described by a free part    @xmath34    and the interactions    @xmath35    one exciton sector is solved by the ansatz    @xmath36    which leads to a coupled set of equations    @xmath37    where the energy is    @xmath38    the scattered photon wave function can be written in the form    @xmath39    where we have introduced the function    @xmath40    absorption cross section is therefore proportional to    @xmath41    remembering that excitons are created with zero momentum we need the function ( 26 ) at k=0 , we have    @xmath42    assuming linear dispersion for the phonons ( cf . eq .",
    "16 ) we can perform the integration explicitly    @xmath43    the logarithm does not play , numerically speaking , any significant role , therefore we have obtained a familiar lorentzian shape .",
    "its width is given by    @xmath44    and depends on @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "since experimentally it is of the order of 0.026  ev , we can estimate @xmath45 if we assume @xmath46 , which we arbitrally have taken to be 4.0  ev .",
    "the @xmath47 parameter gives the position of the absorption peak , taking it to be 3.104  ev we get an excellent agreement with the experiment .",
    "presence of an acceptor molecule , which we place at site @xmath48 , introduces an additional term in the exciton hamiltonian , which now reads    @xmath0-(\\omega-\\omega_{0})a_{0}^{+}a_{0 }      , \\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is the acceptor excitation energy [ 7 ] . in momentum space",
    "this is equivalent to the introduction of a separable potential with constant formfactor @xmath50    @xmath51    and    @xmath52    as shown in [ 7,8 ] for small values of lambda , leading to a shallow bound state , we get large absorption , while paradoxically large lambda does induce strong absorption .",
    "the question now is : will the interaction with phonons destroy this delicate mechanism ?",
    "a satisfying feature of our interaction is that the model is still analytically solvable .",
    "the full interaction is now    @xmath53    which gives now a set of equations in one exciton - one photon - two phonons sectors ( which are coupled )    @xmath54    again the system can be solved and we get the scattering part of the photon wave function    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    showing the effects of acceptor and phonon interactions in all its gory details .",
    "the last line is the effect of the acceptor .",
    "we will obtain a significant enhancement if this term is small .",
    "as assumed above we can take    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the experimental width .",
    "the whole behavior is therefore controlled by the integral    @xmath60    for suitable values of coupling lambda real part of @xmath61 can be canceled , leading to a large enhancement , provided that the imaginary part is reasonably small .",
    "inspection of fig .  1    , where the y axis is at the threshold for exciton production , shows indeed that large values of @xmath62 ( i.e. lambda small ! ) are favored . absorption spectra with @xmath62 small ( fig .  2 ) and @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "3 ) show an enhancement of the order of @xmath63 .",
    "the effect is there , but disappointingly small .",
    "the reason lies in the large value of the imaginary part of sigma ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) .",
    "we must notice however that this is a one dimensional model . in two dimensions",
    "we would get formally the same expressions , but all integrations are 2 dimensional .",
    "in particular the function sigma , after angular integration would be    @xmath64    and has integration measure @xmath65 , which suppresses small @xmath23 - just what is needed .",
    "the imaginary part at threshold is now strongly reduced ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the absorption enhancement at small lambda now is of the order of @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "it is seen that the fact that j aggregate is a two dimensional structure is of paramount importance .",
    "we have shown that our postulated mechanism : exciton annihilation into 2 phonons leads to a solvable model .",
    "it describes correctly the width of j - aggregate absorption spectra . in the case of introduced acceptors , the large absorption on shallow bound states is confirmed , but two dimensional geometry seems essential .",
    "of course full two dimensional calculation is needed and will be presented shortly . in order to describe fluorescence spectra",
    ", we have to include the usual energy loss by phonon radiation mechanism [ 6 ] . in conclusion",
    "let us remark that absorption energy on shallow bound states , postulated already in [ 7 ] not only survives the introduction of realistic dissipation mechanisms , but acquires new features allowing for a better agreement with experiment .",
