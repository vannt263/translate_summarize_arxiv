    "alcubierre demonstrated that it is theoretically possible , within the framework of general relativity , to attain arbitrarily large velocities  @xcite .",
    "in fact , numerous solutions to the einstein field equations are now known that allow `` effective '' superluminal travel @xcite . despite the use of the term",
    "superluminal , it is not `` really '' possible to travel faster than light , in any _ local _ sense . providing a general _ global _ definition of superluminal travel is no trivial matter  @xcite , but it is clear that the spacetimes that allow `` effective '' superluminal travel generically suffer from the severe drawback that they also involve significant negative energy densities .",
    "more precisely , superluminal effects are associated with the presence of _ exotic _ matter , that is , matter that violates the null energy condition [ nec ] . in fact , superluminal spacetimes violate all the known energy conditions , and ken olum demonstrated that negative energy densities and superluminal travel are intimately related  @xcite . although most classical forms of matter are thought to obey the energy conditions , they are certainly violated by certain quantum fields  @xcite .",
    "additionally , certain classical systems ( such as non - minimally coupled scalar fields ) have been found that violate the null and the weak energy conditions  .",
    "finally , we mention that recent observations in cosmology strongly suggest that the cosmological fluid violates the strong energy condition [ sec ] , and provides tantalizing hints that the nec _ might _ possibly be violated in a classical regime  @xcite .    for warp drive spacetimes , by using the `` quantum inequality '' deduced by ford and roman  , it was soon verified that enormous amounts of energy are needed to sustain superluminal warp drive spacetimes  @xcite . to reduce the enormous amounts of exotic matter needed in the superluminal warp drive ,",
    "van den broeck proposed a slight modification of the alcubierre metric which considerably ameliorates the conditions of the solution  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , by using the `` quantum inequality '' , enormous quantities of negative energy densities are needed to support the superluminal krasnikov tube  @xcite .",
    "however , gravel and plante  @xcite in a way similar in spirit to the van den broeck analysis , showed that it is theoretically possible to lower significantly the mass of the krasnikov tube .    in counterpoint , in this article we shall be interested in applying linearized gravity to warp drive spacetimes , testing the energy conditions at first and second order of the warp - bubble velocity",
    ". we will take the bubble velocity to be non - relativistic , @xmath2 .",
    "thus we are not focussing attention on the `` superluminal '' aspects of the warp bubble , such as the appearance of horizons  @xcite , and of closed timelike curves  @xcite , but rather on a secondary unremarked effect : the warp drive ( _ if it can be realised in nature _ ) appears to be an example of a `` reaction - less drive '' wherein the warp bubble moves by interacting with the geometry of spacetime instead of expending reaction mass .",
    "a particularly interesting aspect of this construction is that one may place a finite mass spaceship at the origin and consequently analyze how the warp field compares with the mass - energy of the spaceship .",
    "this is not possible in the usual finite - strength warp field , since by definition the point in the center of the warp bubble moves along a geodesic and is `` massless '' .",
    "that is , in the usual formalism the spaceship is always treated as a test particle , while in the linearized theory we can treat the spaceship as a finite mass object .    because we do not make any _ a priori _ assumptions as to the ultimate source of the energy condition violations , we will not use ( or need ) the quantum inequalities",
    "this means that the restrictions we derive on warp drive spacetimes are more generic than those derived using the quantum inequalities  the restrictions derived in this article will hold regardless of whether the warp drive is assumed to be classical or quantum in its operation .",
    "we do not mean to suggest that such a `` reaction - less drive '' is achievable with current technology  indeed the analysis below will , even in the weak - field limit , place very stringent conditions on the warp bubble .",
    "these conditions are so stringent that it appears unlikely that the `` warp drive '' will ever prove technologically useful .",
    "the alcubierre `` warp drive '' , and the related natrio `` warp drive '' , are likely to retain their status as useful `` gedanken - experiments ''  they are useful primarily as a theoretician s probe of the foundations of general relativity , and we wish to sound a strong cautionary note against over - enthusiastic mis - interpretation of the technological situation .",
    "within the framework of general relativity , alcubierre demonstrated that it is in principle possible to warp spacetime in a small _ bubble - like _ region , in such a way that the bubble may attain arbitrarily large velocities .",
    "inspired by the inflationary phase of the early universe , the enormous speed of separation arises from the expansion of spacetime itself .",
    "the simplest model for hyper - fast travel is to create a local distortion of spacetime , producing an expansion behind the bubble , and an opposite contraction ahead of it .",
    "natrio s version of the warp drive dispensed with the need for expansion at the cost of introducing a slightly more complicated metric .",
    "the warp drive spacetime metric , in cartesian coordinates , is given by ( with @xmath3 ) @xmath4\\cdot [ \\d\\vec x - \\vec \\beta(x , y , z - z_0(t ) ) \\ ; \\d t]\\ , .",

    "thus warp drive spacetimes can also be viewed as specific examples of `` shift - only '' spacetimes .",

    "their four - velocity is normal to the spatial hypersurface with @xmath26 , and they are close analogues of the usual eulerian observers of fluid mechanics , which move with the flow of the fluid . the spaceship , which in the original formulation is treated as a test particle which moves along the curve @xmath27 , can easily be seen to always move along a timelike curve , regardless of the value of @xmath28 .",
    "one can also verify that the proper time along this curve equals the coordinate time , by simply substituting @xmath27 in equation ( [ cartesianwarpmetric ] ) .",
    "this reduces to @xmath29 , taking into account @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if we attempt to treat the spaceship as more than a test particle , we must confront the fact that by construction we have forced @xmath12 outside the warp bubble .",
    "[ consider , for instance , the explicit form function of equation ( [ e : form ] ) in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "] this implies that the spacetime geometry is asymptotically minkowski space , and in particular the adm mass ( defined by taking the limit as one moves to spacelike infinity @xmath33 ) is zero .",
    "that is , the adm mass of the spaceship and the warp field generators must be exactly compensated by the adm mass due to the stress - energy of the warp - field itself .",
    "viewed in this light it is now patently obvious that there must be significant violations of the classical energy conditions ( at least in the original version of the warp - drive spacetime ) , and the interesting question becomes `` where are these energy condition violations localized ? '' .",
    "one of our tasks in the current article will be to see if we can first avoid this exact cancellation of the adm mass , and second , to see if we can make qualitative and quantitative statements concerning the localization and `` total amount '' of energy condition violations .",

    "it is easy to verify that the energy density is distributed in a toroidal region around the @xmath8-axis , in the direction of travel of the warp bubble  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps instructive to point out that the energy density for this class of spacetimes is nowhere positive . that the total adm mass can nevertheless be zero is due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of the einstein equations .",

    "thus , this warp drive spacetime can be thought of as a warp bubble that pushes space aside and thereby `` slides '' through space .",

    "for the wec we use the results of appendix [ a : natario ] to write @xmath82 this is manifestly negative and so the wec is violated everywhere throughout the spacetime .",
    "we can again quantify the `` total amount '' of energy condition violating matter in the warp bubble by defining @xmath83 now @xmath80 in the interior of the warp bubble is by definition @xmath0 , while the size of the warp bubble is taken to be @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore gradients of @xmath80 in the bubble walls are of order @xmath84 , and the thickness of the bubble walls is of order @xmath85 .",

    "the interest of this exercise lies in the application of the wec .",

    "in this article we have seen how the warp drive spacetimes ( in particular , the alcubierre and natrio warp drives ) can be used as gedanken - experiments to probe the foundations of general relativity . though they are useful toy models for theoretical investigations , as potential technology they are greatly lacking .",
    "we have verified that the non - perturbative exact solutions of the warp drive spacetimes necessarily violate the classical energy conditions , and continue to do so for arbitrarily low warp bubble velocity  thus the energy condition violations in this class of spacetimes is generic to the form of the geometry under consideration and is not simply a side - effect of the `` superluminal '' properties .",

    "we have tested and quantified the energy conditions to first and second order of the warp bubble velocity . by doing",
    "so we have been able to safely ignore the causality problems associated with `` superluminal '' motion , and so have focussed attention on a previously unremarked feature of the `` warp drive '' spacetime .",
    "if it is possible to realise even a weak - field warp drive in nature , such a spacetime appears to be an example of a `` reaction - less drive '' .",
    "that is , the warp bubble moves by interacting with the geometry of spacetime instead of expending reaction mass , and the spaceship ( which in linearized theory can be treated as a finite mass object placed within the warp bubble ) , is simply carried along with it .",
    "we have verified that in this case , the `` total amount '' of energy condition violating matter ( the `` net '' negative energy of the warp field ) must be an appreciable fraction of the positive mass of the spaceship carried along by the warp bubble .",
    "this places an extremely stringent condition on the warp drive spacetime , namely , that for all conceivably interesting situations the bubble velocity should be absurdly low , and it therefore appears unlikely that , by using this analysis , the warp drive will ever prove to be technologically useful . finally , we point out that any attempt at building up a `` strong - field '' warp drive starting from an approximately minkowski spacetime will inevitably have to pass through a weak - field regime .",
