    "recent cmb observations @xcite indicate that the early universe has passed through an inflationary period with hubble parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the standard theoretical setup for inflationary models generically involve some scalar inflaton fields slowly rolling down their potential .",
    "the slow - roll that is needed to ensure a resolution to the problems of standard big bang cosmology , and consistency with the cmb results , demands @xmath10 and @xmath11 to be smaller or of order @xmath12 @xcite . in the context of simple single scalar models with potential @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath6",
    "are a measure of flatness of the potential and , specifically , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the effective mass of the inflaton field .",
    "therefore , the theoretical framework invoked for inflationary model building should also provide mechanisms to protect the potential and its flatness against quantum and/or quantum gravity corrections . in physics models",
    "we generically associate smallness and protection of a quantity like @xmath6 with an approximate symmetry , such that when the symmetry is exact this parameter ( here the effective mass of inflaton ) is zero .",
    "supersymmetry , for example , can be such a symmetry .",
    "it turns out that in the presence of gravity , as in our case where we are dealing with inflation models , symmetries protecting @xmath6 are all broken , inducing an inflaton mass term of order the hubble scale @xmath17 of the background .",
    "we hence end up with an order one @xmath6 , i.e. , the @xmath6-problem .    from the above discussion",
    "it is seen that the @xmath6-problem may appear in two ways : in a top - down approach where we invoke a theory of quantum gravity like string theory for inflationary model building . or in a bottom - up approach where we take the usual field theory setup of einstein gravity plus scalar inflaton fields , assuming that this framework is valid up to planck scale @xmath18 . in the top - down approach the @xmath6-problem appears as a classical ( not loop ) effect , usually due to the interaction of the inflationary sector with the moduli stabilization sector ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . in these models",
    "it turns out to be easy to have small @xmath14 with controlled back - reactions on it , but @xmath6 receives order one corrections .",
    "intuitively , in these top - down setups , the @xmath6-problem can be understood as follows . with a vacuum energy of order @xmath19",
    "all scalars , including the inflaton , will be endowed with soft masses of order @xmath20 since the supersymmetry breaking scale is not below @xmath17 . in this work , however , we will focus on the @xmath6-problem in the bottom - up approach .    in the bottom - up approach the @xmath6-problem arises from _ quantum _ loop corrections to the tree - level graviton - scalar - scalar vertex . despite being non - renormalizable",
    ", one can still apply the ( wilsonian ) effective field theory techniques to the einstein gravity theory and consider loop corrections , e.g. see @xcite . in the presence of a scalar field @xmath21",
    "minimally coupled to einstein gravity , as in generic inflationary models , these corrections at one loop level generically involve a @xmath22 term , a term whose presence was noted long ago @xcite .",
    "as we will review below , such a term is quadratically divergent and in the one loop effective action appears as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the uv cutoff of the theory and @xmath25 is an order one coefficient . assuming a planckian cutoff scale , @xmath26 , in an inflationary background where @xmath27",
    ", this term yields a correction of order @xmath28 to the inflaton mass , causing the @xmath6-problem .",
    "the @xmath6-problem , or the hubble scale mass term for the effective inflaton field , seems quite generic and one may put forward the idea of _ kinematically _ reducing the coefficient @xmath29 . in this letter",
    "we explore this possibility .",
    "one obvious possibility is to choose the cutoff @xmath24 , the scale where quantum gravity effects become important , to be one or two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath18 @xcite . in this case",
    "the coupling constant of gravitons will be reduced like the momentum uv cutoff and the @xmath6 problem persists .",
    "alternatively , one may explore the idea that @xmath25 is a kinematical factor that for some reason is not of order one , while the bare cutoff @xmath24 is @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , similar suppressions are already very well known in the context of large @xmath0 gauge theories @xcite : the nonplanar part of a given feynman diagram comes with powers of @xmath5 suppression compared to the planar part of the same diagram .",
    "as we will show similar analysis can be repeated for the theories involving large number of scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity . in particular , if we have @xmath0 number of light fields , lighter than @xmath30 , @xmath25 turns out to have a @xmath5 suppression factor . in a sense , as if , the diagram leading to is a nonplanar diagram .",
    "this observation is closely related to the species dressed gravity cutoff scale  ideas discussed in @xcite , in light of which the @xmath31 result may be interpreted as dealing with a dressed cutoff  @xmath32 while @xmath33 .",
    "inflationary models with many scalar fields have recently got attention in view of their success in providing a natural explanation for the smallness of the inflaton self - couplings ( the issue of steepness of the potential ) and for the super - planckian excursion of the effective inflaton in the field space @xcite .",
    "this idea is not exotic to string theory motivated inflationary settings where it is quite common to have an abundant number of fields / degrees of freedom with masses below the dressed cutoff @xmath30 , see , e.g , @xcite .",
    "even though in some of these setups , like n - flation , the individual field excursion is greater than the dressed uv cutoff , some , like gauged m - flation @xcite or multiple m5-branes inflation @xcite , remain immune to thisbeyond - the - cutoff  problem .    in this work",
    "we examine the above proposed @xmath5 resolution to the @xmath34-problem .",
    "we assume that there is a hierarchy of scales between @xmath17 , the dressed gravity cutoff @xmath35 and @xmath18 : @xmath36 which is easily achieved by e.g. @xmath37 .",
    "this provides a window where one can safely use the standard techniques of quantum field theory and effectively deal with a system that could be described by einstein - hilbert gravity , the inflaton sector , and other heavy remnants of the theory of quantum gravity whose masses @xmath38 falls below the new gravity cutoff , i.e. @xmath39 .    the outline of this work is as follows .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 light scalars minimally coupled to einstein gravity and work out basic feynman rules of the theory and compute the quadratically - divergent part of the one loop contributions to the graviton propagator and graviton - scalar - scalar vertices .",
    "we show that one loop graviton two - point function has a linear @xmath0 parametric dependence while the graviton - scalar - scalar vertex has no @xmath0 dependence . therefore ,",
    "if we ( re)normalize the graviton two - point function , the vertex will have a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "this latter leads to @xmath31 ( _ cf . _ ) .",
    "we discuss how this can resolve the @xmath6-problem in the context of many - field models like n - flation @xcite or m - flation .",
    "consider the action of @xmath0 scalars minimally coupled to gravity @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of scalar fields , and summation over repeated @xmath43 indices is assumed .",
    "one or some of these scalars play the role of inflaton(s ) , and @xmath44 could be any potential that realizes slow - roll inflation at the classical level , while the rest exhibit possible remnants of the underlying quantum gravity theory .",
    "we assume the mass of these remnants to be below our dressed cutoff @xmath45 .",
    "the action once quantized will receive all possible corrections compatible with the symmetries of the system , in particular an @xmath46 correction which appears at one loop level . as discussed if this term comes with an order one coupling can cause the @xmath34-problem . in what follows",
    "we show by carrying out explicit one loop calculations involving gravitons , that this term is suppressed by factors of @xmath5 , providing a setting to resolve the @xmath6-problem in the context of multi - field models of inflation . in our analysis in this section and section 3",
    "we ignore the loops involving scalar self - interactions .",
    "as we will discuss in the discussion section these diagrams do not change our main result .      to perform the one loop analysis , as in any quantum field theory , we need to work out basic tree level feynman diagrams of propagators and interaction vertices .",
    "to do so for the gravity sector , following @xcite , we introduce the tensor densities , @xmath47 to bring the gravitational part of the action to the goldberg s form @xcite @xmath48 we will decompose the density metric to the flat part and the deviation from the flat space part , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 the inverse of @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where on the r.h.s .",
    "the indices are raised and lowered by the flat minkowski space metric @xmath54 .",
    "perturbing the action up to third order in @xmath55 , one obtains @xmath56 where @xmath57 note that @xmath58 is written to lowest order in @xmath55 and so it is independent of @xmath55 .",

    "this may be done through gauge fixing term @xmath64 in figure [ hphiphi1 ] we have plotted the basic feynman graphs in this gauge .",
    "having the tree level theory we now proceed to the one loop analysis and revisit the one loop propagator calculations as well as graviton - scalar vertex .",
    "since we are interested in the quadratically divergent term , it is appropriate to use cutoff regularization ; dimensional regularization , which is very well suited in capturing the logarithmic divergences and already used in @xcite , can not be employed here .",

    "the first two are coming from the pure einstein gravity sector and the other three involve scalar fields running in the loop .",
    "since we are only interested in the @xmath0 dependence of the diagrams we focus on the ones with scalar fields in the loop . in electrodynamics , the gauge invariance enforces the photon self - energy to be transverse .",
    "this reduces the degree of divergence from two to zero .",
    "however , in gravity the gauge invariance does not do so .",
    "it only relates the three diagrams that involve the scalar field in the loops .",
    "thus the quartic divergence , @xmath65 , which corresponds to the cosmological constant term , @xmath66 , remains .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that @xmath66 is still gauge - invariant whereas @xmath67 is not .",
    "this is the famous cosmological constant problem which we are not intended to deal with here .",
    "next - to - leading divergent part diverges like @xmath68 and this is the part that renormalizes the graviton propagator .",
    "in particular , the diagram that involves two graviton - scalar three - vertices is @xmath69 as long as @xmath70 .",
    "the diagram involving the graviton - scalar four vertex is of the form @xmath71 the leading part of this integral is quartic in the uv cutoff and just renormalizes the cosmological constant .",
    "the next - to - leading order is quadratic in the uv cutoff and is proportional to @xmath72 , assuming that the masses @xmath38 are all much smaller than the undressed ( bare ) uv cutoff  @xmath24 , which is taken to be @xmath18 .",
    "the last diagram in figure [ 1-loop - gr ] has only a quartic divergence and does not contribute to the renormalization of the graviton propagator at all .",
    "thus we see that the one loop graviton propagator is proportional to number of fields @xmath0 , as well as @xmath73 .",
    "this term may be viewed as the correction to the newton constant or @xmath18 .",
    "that is , the quantum gravity effects become important when this term becomes of the same order as the classical tree level value .",
    "this happens if the cutoff momentum @xmath24 is of order @xmath74 which is the _ species dressed uv cutoff_. besides this `` perturbative '' argument , the fact that one should use this reduced cutoff instead of @xmath18 in presence of large number of species has also been backed up by black hole physics and hawking radiation from black holes in theories with large number of light species @xcite .",
    "one may also compute one loop correction to the scalar propagator .",
    "again there are diagrams involving only scalars and two diagrams involving gravitons .",
    "it is immediate to see that the latter two diagrams have no parametric dependence on the number of scalars @xmath0 .      as depicted in figure [ scalar - gravitons - exchange ] , there are three diagrams contributing to scalar - graviton vertex at one loop level .",

    "the details of the loop calculations , which are straightforward , are given in the appendix , here we just quote the result .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the @xmath0 dependence of the loop expressions we only focus on that issue here .",
    "there are no @xmath0 dependence appearing in any of the diagrams in figure [ scalar - gravitons - exchange ] , and these diagrams , compared to the tree level results , are proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "this in particular implies that the coefficient in front of the effective @xmath46 term ( up to numeric factors of @xmath76 ) is proportional to @xmath77 and if @xmath24 is the species dressed cutoff @xmath78 this term is suppressed by the number of light species @xmath0 .    to summarize",
    ", the one loop correction to graviton propagator is dressed with a power of @xmath0 , while the graviton - scalar - scalar vertex is @xmath0 independent .",
    "this result is very similar to the well - established t hooft @xmath5 expansion @xcite , that if we normalize the two point function to one , the interaction term has @xmath5 suppression .",
    "so far we have shown that in a theory with @xmath0 number of species with masses lighter than dressed cutoff @xmath78 , the coefficient of the @xmath46 term generated at one loop level is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an order one @xmath82-number .",
    "the above analysis was carried out in a flat space background and should be revisited for inflationary ( almost de sitter ) backgrounds .",
    "it is readily seen , however , that the basic argument behind the factors of @xmath0 does not depend on the background geometry .",
    "also , the presence of the new scale @xmath83 should not affect our argument in any qualitatively important way .",
    "we still expect that species lighter than the high energy cutoff @xmath78 in general will contribute to @xmath0 .",
    "the only change concerns the very lightest species , with masses roughly below the hubble scale @xmath17 , where momenta at super - hubble scales will not contribute , as we will now show .",
    "we recall that the equation of motion of a free massive scalar on an inflationary background is @xmath84 where dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic comoving time and @xmath85 is the scale factor .",
    "the relevant observation is that the modes contributing to @xmath0 are the _",
    "quantum modes _ , e.g. those with oscillatory ( as opposed to exponentially damping or growing ) behavior . to be able to solve the above equation ,",
    "let us drop the time - dependent piece @xmath86 for the moment and consider the equation @xmath87 whose solution is of the form @xmath88 with @xmath89 . to have a quantum mode @xmath90 should have an imaginary part .",
    "this latter implies that @xmath91 .",
    "note that this result is @xmath92 independent and that addition of the @xmath86 term will only slightly modify this result , as it is positive definite : all the modes with @xmath93 , regardless of their @xmath92 , are always quantum modes , while modes with @xmath94 are _ classical _ for large wavelengths ( i.e. super - hubble  physical momenta @xmath95 ) , and quantum mechanical for sub - hubble momenta .",
    "note also that the damping coefficient  @xmath96 is removed in the process of canonical quantization as canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath63 is @xmath97 .",
    "this is of course the standard established result in inflationary cosmic perturbation theory and quantum field theory on curved ( de sitter ) space time @xcite .",
    "since we are only interested in the uv behavior of the loop integrals , we can instead of integrating over @xmath92 all the way from zero to @xmath98 restrict the integral to go from @xmath17 to @xmath99 . in this way we avoid the unnecessary complication with super - hubble modes . in summary , all the modes lighter than @xmath99 , with both super - hubble or sub - hubble masses , contribute to the @xmath0 in the loop integral .",
    "in other words , as long as @xmath100 , @xmath0 is the same for inflationary and flat space and @xmath101 where @xmath0 is the number of species lighter than the cutoff , @xmath99 . in particular",
    ", the coefficient of the @xmath46 term generated at one loop will become @xmath80 , with @xmath81 of order one .",
    "we are now ready to address the @xmath6-problem . to this end ,",
    "we recall that the one loop corrected action is @xmath102 hence , the slow - roll parameter @xmath103 , where @xmath104 , is@xmath105 to have a successful slow - roll inflationary period we usually demand @xmath106 , and if we assume @xmath107 , quantum corrections to @xmath6 will be suppressed enough for @xmath108 . so that this effective inflaton field is canonically normalized . the @xmath46 term , being quadratic in the @xmath63 s , will not receive any normalization factors due to the @xmath0 scaling relating canonically normalized inflaton and the original fields . ]",
    "the bottom - up @xmath6-problem seems quite generic to all models of inflation that involve a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "even if the parameters of the inflaton potential are chosen meticulously at tree - level , the loop corrections that arise from interactions of the graviton with the scalar field create the quadratically divergent conformal mass term which leads to the @xmath6-problem , if the uv cutoff of the theory is of order @xmath18 .",
    "this kind of @xmath6-problem is of course different from the `` top - down '' @xmath6-problem arising within the string theory setups in which the volume modulus stabilization often resurrects the @xmath6-problem .",
    "the precision that should be enforced upon the tree - level parameters are often not needed to sustain inflation , but to match the observed density of perturbation @xcite . in this letter",
    "we examined the possibility of circumventing the @xmath6-problem , in the former sense discussed above , in many - field models of inflation that are minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "these many - fields whose masses are assumed to be smaller than @xmath3 , have a natural appearance in effective low energy field theory description of quantum gravity models . as we argued",
    "@xmath109 will resolve the @xmath6-problem . even though it is not necessary for our argument",
    ", the scalar fields should be non - interacting to realize inflation .",
    "one example of such many - field models is n - flation @xcite which has the @xmath110 symmetric potential @xmath111 .",
    "as stated above , a few hundred scalar fields will be enough to circumvent the @xmath6-problem . like its chaotic counterpart",
    ", the mass parameter @xmath16 has to be @xmath112 which is smaller than @xmath45 unless one resorts to an unnaturally large number of scalar fields , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath113 .",
    "this of course comes at the price of exposing the model to quantum instability of the type discussed in @xcite .",
    "namely , the quantum fluctuations of these light fields may dominate over the classical evolution of the inflaton .",
    "assisted model with quartic potential @xmath114 is another possibility . to have an observationally viable model",
    ", the effective coupling must be around @xmath115 and thus with @xmath116 , one needs around @xmath117 scalar fields .",
    "this scenario also suffers from the above quantum instability with such a large number of massless scalar fields .",
    "another disadvantage of both these two models is that the physical excursion of the fields is larger than @xmath45 during the required @xmath118 e - folds of inflation .",
    "another explicit example is m - flation @xcite or its gauged version @xcite where the inflaton potential is constructed by three @xmath119 non - commutative hermitian matrices whose action is invariant under @xmath120 .",
    "the classical dynamics is simplified considerably in the @xmath121 sector where these three scalar fields are proportional to the generators of the @xmath121 algebra . gauged m - flation , in addition to the above ingredients ,",
    "has an extra @xmath122 field , associated with `` center of mass '' @xmath123 .",
    "m - flation in the @xmath121 sector besides the inflaton field contains some number of `` spectator fields '' which do not contribute to classical inflationary trajectory while can be excited quantum mechanically and appear in the loops .",
    "for the gauged m - flation there are @xmath124 such scalar modes and @xmath125 massive vector modes .",
    "these modes have a hierarchical spectrum , _ i.e. _ they can be lighter or heavier than the hubble scale @xmath17 , for the explicit masses see @xcite .",
    "not all these modes are light enough to be counted in the dressed cutoff . as discussed in @xcite , the number of `` contributing species '' @xmath126 varies between @xmath127 and @xmath128 , depending on the region of the potential inflation happens .",
    "hence , the species dressed uv cutoff is @xmath129 .",
    "consequently the @xmath22 term is suppressed by a factor of @xmath130 and could be safely ignored .",
    "gauged m - flation could be motivated from the branes dynamics in an appropriate flux where the above matrices correspond to three of the perpendicular directions of a stack of @xmath0 d3-branes which are scalars in the adjoint representation of the @xmath120 . as such , although the  quantum \" @xmath6-problem is resolved for m - flation , embedded within string theory , one should still deal with the `` stringy @xmath6-problem '' ( cf . introduction for further references and discussions ) .    finally , the term leading to the @xmath6-problem , @xmath4 , is a one - loop but marginal operator .",
    "one may naturally worry about other loop corrections , that enhancement factors of @xmath0 will dominate over @xmath131 suppressions .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the largest such @xmath0 enhancement factor appears in the graviton two point function ( at higher loops ) for which this factor is @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is number of loops .",
    "all the other diagrams will be of the form @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "hence our one loop result seems to be also valid to all orders .",

    "we would like to thank liam mcallister for helpful discussions .",
    "now let us focus on all the diagrams which may generate the @xmath22 term , or equivalently @xmath136 , at the one - loop order .",
    "the first one , is given by the left diagram in figure [ hphiphi1 ] , where a graviton exchange between two external scalars modifies the scalar form factor .",

    "there are six momenta in the numerator , only four of which are internal",
    ". thus the integral will be divergent as @xmath138    the other diagram that contributes to the @xmath139 vertex is the middle one in figure [ scalar - gravitons - exchange ] . to estimate the leading divergent part of this diagram",
    ", one should note that the vertex that involves three @xmath140 is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath142   \\ , .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] sum is over symmetrization on the index pairs @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 and also the six permutation done over momentum index triplets @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "again , this diagram has six momenta in the numerator , two of which are external .",
    "thus the divergent part of diagram behaves as times the terms among which @xmath22 exists .",
    "finally , let us look at the right one - loop diagram in fig .",
    "( [ scalar - gravitons - exchange ] ) .",
    "the vertex @xmath149 is proportional to @xmath150 . in more details : @xmath151   \\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the diagram contains two propagators in the denominator and four momenta in the numerator , two of which are external . thus the leading correction will be , again , of order times the terms among which @xmath22 exists .",
    "note that besides the conformal mass term , there are also other higher dimensional operators , whose explicit coefficients could be obtained by exactly calculating the amplitudes .",
    "for example , from usual tensorial analysis , terms like @xmath152 are expected to be generated from such one loop diagrams . however , all these terms are suppressed by extra powers of the cutoff and also by slow - roll parameters in an inflationary background .",
    "the other point which is worth mentioning is that the existence of higher order self - interactions for the scalar fields will not disturb our argument .",
    "for example inclusion of mass term in the potential for the inflaton , will modify the scalar field propagator and also add corrections proportional to @xmath153 in the @xmath154 vertex .",
    "such terms would at most introduce correction of order @xmath155 to the leading contribution .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath156 , the effect of such terms are very small",
