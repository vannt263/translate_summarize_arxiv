    "during the last decade , it has been realized that bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) were promising candidates for producing acoustic analogs of gravitational black holes , with possible experimental signature of the elusive hawking radiation .",
    "the acoustic analogy had been proposed on a general setting by unruh in 1981 @xcite , and its specific implementation using becs has been first proposed by garay _",
    "et al . _ , followed by many others @xcite .",
    "we are now reaching a stage where experimental realizations and the study of these systems are possible @xcite and it is important to propose realistic configurations of acoustic black holes and possible signatures of hawking radiation in becs .",
    "other experimental routes for observing analog hawking radiation effects are based on non linear optical devices @xcite or surface waves on moving fluids @xcite .",
    "note that this last option is restricted to the _ stimulated regime _ where the hawking radiation results from a disturbance external to the system .    in this line ,",
    "density correlations have been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite as a tool making it possible to identify the _ spontaneous _ hawking signal and to extract it from thermal noise .",
    "the physical picture behind this idea is the same as the one initially proposed by hawking @xcite : quantum fluctuations can be viewed as constant emission and re - absorption of virtual particles .",
    "these particles can tunnel out near the event horizon and are then separated by the background flow ( which is subsonic outside the acoustic black hole and supersonic inside ) , giving rise to correlated currents emitted away from the region of the horizon .",
    "in contrast to the gravitational case , the experimentalist is able to extract information from the interior of an acoustic black hole .",
    "it is thus possible to get insight on the hawking effect by measuring a correlation signal between the currents emitted inside and outside the black hole .",
    "this two - body correlation signal appears to be poorly affected by the thermal noise and seems to be a more efficient measure of the hawking effect than the direct detection of hawking phonons ( see ref .",

    "dimensional ( 1d ) flows of becs , following a suggestion by leonhardt _",
    "@xcite , it is possible , within a bogoliubov treatment of quantum fluctuations , to give a detailed account of the one and two - body hawking signals .",
    "this idea was fully developed in refs . @xcite and @xcite to obtain physical predictions for specific configurations .",
    "@xcite focused on a schematic black hole configuration introduced in @xcite and denoted as a `` flat profile configuration '' in the following : it consists of a uniform flow of a 1d bec in which the two - body interaction is spatially modulated in order to locally modify the speed of sound in the system  forming a subsonic upstream region and a supersonic downstream one  although the velocity and the density of the flow remain constant .",
    "however , this type of flow , with a position dependent two - body interaction allowing an easy theoretical treatment , is only possible in presence of an external potential specially tailored so that the local chemical potential remains constant everywhere ( see details in sec .",
    "[ flat ] ) .",
    "this makes the whole system quite difficult to realize experimentally .    in the present work we propose simpler sonic analogs of black holes",
    "for which a fully analytic theoretical treatment of the quantum correlations is still possible .",
    "we present a detailed account of the bogoliubov treatment of quantum fluctuations in these settings and show that density correlations provide , also in these realistic configurations , a good evidence of the hawking effect .",
    "we also discuss the recent work of franchini and kravtsov @xcite who proposed an interesting scenario for explaining the peculiarities of the two - body density matrix @xmath0 in presence of an horizon .",
    "elaborating on the similarities of @xmath0 with the level correlation function of non standard ensembles of random matrices @xcite , one can argue that the non local features of @xmath0 typical for hawking radiation should be connected to a modification of its short range behavior .",
    "we spend some time for precisely discussing this point in the framework of the bogoliubov description of the fluctuations .",
    "our analytical study of the wave functions of the excitations makes it possible to obtain an non - ambiguous confirmation of this hypothesis .",

    "it appears convenient to describe the behavior of the excitations in the system in terms of a @xmath1-matrix , the properties of which are discussed in detail .",

    "[ fig1 ] corresponds to a very specific case in the parameter space spanned by the intensity of the delta potential and the flow velocities , which is on the verge of becoming time dependent ( see ref .",

    "@xcite for the delta peak configuration , we believe that , also in the present case , it is possible to dynamically reach the stationary configuration depicted in fig .",
    "this is supported by the experimental results presented by the technion group @xcite who studied a very similar configuration ( with the additional complication of the occurrence of a white hole horizon ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] is stable and can be reached experimentally .",
    "we make here a remark which is also relevant for the delta peak configuration : the precise location of the sonic horizon is not well defined . in both configurations ( waterfall or delta peak )",
    "one may define a local sound velocity , and the point where the local flow velocity exceeds the local speed of sound can be chosen as the location of the sonic horizon .",
    "then one finds that the sonic horizon is located slightly upstream the interface @xmath88 ( in the waterfall configuration for instance , at @xmath88 the local flow velocity is already @xmath89 times larger than the local sound velocity ) .",
    "however , the local sound velocity is an approximate concept , only rigorously valid in regimes where the bec density varies over typical length scales much larger than the healing length .",
    "this is not the case in the waterfall and delta peak configurations near @xmath88 and , as a result , the concept of sonic horizon is ill defined . in the fully quantum treatment presented below",
    "we do not use this concept : the important point for our analysis is simply that the upstream flow velocity is asymptotically ( i.e. , when @xmath90 ) larger than @xmath33 .",
    "hence , for preciseness we do not state that the upstream flow is subsonic , but that it is _ asymptotically _ subsonic .",

    "the simplest way to obtain this basis set is to start from expression ( [ e5b ] ) , with @xmath18 given by ( [ e1 ] ) , and to treat @xmath91 as a small time dependent classical field , denoted as @xmath92 in the present section , with @xmath93 solution of the classical version of ( [ e0 ] ) .",
