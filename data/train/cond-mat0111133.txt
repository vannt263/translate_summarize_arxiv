    "random walks model a host of phenomena and find application in virtually all areas of physics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of non - interacting , unbiased diffusing walkers @xmath0 , with random initial conditions .",
    "recently , we have studied the _ persistence _ properties of this model @xcite .",
    "the persistence probability @xmath3 has been widely studied in recent years @xcite . in the present context @xmath3",
    "is defined as the fraction of sites which have never been visited by a diffusing particle up to time @xmath2 .",
    "such sites are termed `` persistent sites '' .",
    "we showed @xcite that , in the case of the @xmath0 processes , @xmath12\\ , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the particle density and @xmath14 is the diffusion constant .",
    "the fraction of unvisited sites in this model can equally be thought of as the surviving fraction of immobile particles in the presence of randomly diffusing traps . at @xmath7 , consider each site to contain a static particle , @xmath5 , so that @xmath15 . then for @xmath16 , let particles of another type , @xmath6 , randomly distributed on the lattice with density @xmath17 , diffuse though the system with the @xmath6 particles acting as perfect traps for the @xmath5 particles so that @xmath18 .",
    "this model is just the well - studied `` scavenger '' model of redner and kang @xcite .",
    "the fraction of unvisited sites is then just @xmath19 .",
    "the focus of this paper is to explore the relation between @xmath3 and the fraction of walkers @xmath1 that have never encountered another walker up to time @xmath2 . to facilitate our discussion , we introduce the following definition .",
    "we consider all walkers to be _ uninfected _ at time @xmath7 .",
    "the walkers are , however , considered to be mutually infectious , so that for @xmath20 any contact between walkers leads to mutual contamination .",
    "we therefore define an uninfected walker to be one which has never encountered ( occupied the same site as ) another walker .",
    "we can then refer to @xmath1 as the fraction of uninfected walkers .",
    "the fraction of uninfected walkers is , in fact , isomorphic to the survival probability of @xmath5 particles in the reaction @xmath21 , with equal mobility for both species @xcite . at late times",
    ", one expects the asymptotics of this model to be identical to those of the @xmath4 diffusion - limited process with @xmath22 . for this process",
    "it was proved rigorously by bramson and lebowitz @xcite that @xmath23 in one - dimension , with unknown constant @xmath24 .",
    "therefore we expect identical asymptotic behavior for @xmath1 .",
    "the kinetics of the two species annihilation model has received considerable attention over the past two decades and is largely understood @xcite .",
    "it is well appreciated that in this model , there exists an upper critical dimension @xmath25 , below which spatial fluctuations in the initial distribution of the reactants play a significant role in the evolution of the density of the particles .",
    "this dependence on the microscopic fluctuations invalidates traditional approaches such as the mean - field approximation which yields @xmath26 .",
    "it was first shown by toussaint and wilczek @xcite that , for equal initial densities ( @xmath27 ) of randomly diffusing @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles , the walker density decays anomalously , according to @xmath28 for @xmath29 , assuming that the particles are distributed homogeneously at @xmath7 . in the case of this model",
    "we argued heuristically , on the basis of a toy model @xcite that , @xmath30 \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a constant and @xmath32 .",
    "we extend our study to include an investigation of the fraction of uninfected walkers in this model in one - dimension .",
    "the fraction of uninfected walkers , @xmath1 , is related to the fraction of persistent sites , @xmath3 , in the following manner . in evaluating @xmath3 ,",
    "one considers particles with diffusion constant @xmath14 and addresses the probability that a given site @xmath33 has never been visited by any walker up to time @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , one could consider the site @xmath33 to contain a particle with diffusion constant @xmath34 and address the probability that the particle remains uninfected ( i.e.unvisited ) . however , if the particle initially at position @xmath33 is given a diffusion constant equal to that of the other particles in the system i.e.  @xmath35 , then the probability that it `` persists '' up to time @xmath2 is the probability that it remains uninfected .",
    "this suggests that the number of uninfected particles is a function of the diffusion constants in the problem , with the limiting case @xmath34 corresponding to the standard persistence problem .",
    "clearly , in order to avoid contamination , remaining stationary is a more effective strategy than diffusing .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the fraction of uninfected walkers decays more rapidly than the fraction of uninfected ( unvisited , i.e.   persistent ) sites",
    ". this faster decay of @xmath1 is clearly observed in the simulations .",
    "given the similar decay of @xmath3 in the @xmath0 and @xmath4 processes , these models make a sensible combination to study together . we discover that in both cases , @xmath36^\\gamma$ ] where @xmath37 .",
    "in fact the relation @xmath38^\\gamma$ ] , with @xmath39 close to unity and @xmath40 , describes the data rather accurately in both models over the whole range of times studied , although there are indications in both models that the asymptotic value of @xmath10 is smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "we discuss the @xmath0 model in sec .",
    "ii and follow with the @xmath4 reaction in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "iv with a discussion and summary of the results .",
    "we consider a system of non - interacting , unbiased , diffusing walkers , with random initial conditions .",
    "our numerics are performed on a 1d lattice of size @xmath42 with lattice constant @xmath43 and periodic boundaries . at @xmath7 , @xmath44",
    "random walkers are randomly distributed on the lattice with a maximum of one particle per site so that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , @xmath48 is a consequence of our lattice description and in the continuum limit @xmath49 , where the mean distance between walkers is much larger than the lattice spacing , @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , in order to place the fraction of persistent sites and the fraction of uninfected walkers on an equal footing in our numerical study , we define , @xmath51 so that both @xmath52 and @xmath53 are normalized to 1 .",
    "we now use @xmath54 in the description of our numerical results .",
    "our model is updated using the direct method @xcite i.e.  at each computational step , a particle is picked at random and shifted with probability @xmath55 to a neighboring site , where @xmath14 is the diffusion constant . for @xmath56 ,",
    "any site which is visited by a walker becomes nonpersistent for all remaining time @xmath2 .",
    "mutual infection occurs when two or more particles simultaneously occupy a single lattice site . for each jump made by a particle , time @xmath2",
    "is increased by @xmath57 , where @xmath44 is the current number of particles in the system ( which is constant in the present model ) .",
    "our results are averaged over 100 independent runs .",
    "dimensional analysis demands that , on a _ continuum _ , the fraction of unvisited sites is a function of the dimensionless combination of parameters in the problem , i.e.@xmath58 .",
    "similarly , for the fraction of uninfected walkers , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is some other function .",
    "however , given that our numerical simulations take place on a discrete lattice , we expect the scaling of @xmath3 and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath61 to become strictly true only in the continuum limit , @xmath62 . in order to approximate this limit as closely as possible ,",
    "we choose as our densities @xmath63 , 0.005 and 0.003 , so that @xmath64 .",
    "the dimensionless combination of parameters , @xmath61 , also defines a natural characteristic time scale in the problem , namely @xmath65 .",
    "therefore one expects to observe the asymptotic behavior of the system only after a time @xmath66 has been reached .",
    "however , as far as the persistent properties are concerned , eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) is an exact relation in the continuum limit for all @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we expect to observe @xmath3 approaching asymptopia very quickly in our numerical data . clearly , in the discrete description of the model used in our simulations , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) breaks down at the earliest times since , for very small @xmath2 , lattice effects play a dominant role .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , however , which holds for @xmath1 is a truly asymptotic relation .",
    "unfortunately , the extremely fast decay of @xmath1 leads to small - number effects at very early times in our simulations and we find the limit @xmath67 unattainable with good statistics .",
    "therefore , we limit ourselves to studying the regime up to @xmath68 .",
    "the fraction of unvisited sites decays , in the continuum limit , exactly as the stretched exponential form , eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xcite . in order to make a direct comparison between the fraction of persistent sites , @xmath54 , and the fraction of uninfected walkers , @xmath1 , we present these two quantities on a log - linear plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , using @xmath69 as abscissa .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows clearly that the data scale as a function of the dimensionless quantity @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath1 exhibits behavior characteristic of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , with a faster decay rate than for the fraction of persistent sites i.e.  @xmath70 .",

    "[ fig2 ] indeed shows an almost linear relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in order to evaluate @xmath10 and @xmath77",
    "we performed a linear regression on the data in fig.[fig2 ] in the region indicated by the arrows , thereby avoiding initial transients associated with our lattice description , and the onset of statistical fluctuations between different runs of the data .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we plot @xmath80 and @xmath81 against @xmath82 in fig . [ fig7 ] .",
    "early - time lattice effects , where the different densities do not overlap , are evident in fig .",
    "it is possible that all of our data for @xmath54 and @xmath1 are within the preasymptotic regime , since the @xmath54 curve has not yet saturated to the late - time asymptotic values impied by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that if the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] were asympotically linearly increasing , rather than eventually saturating to a constant , the corresponding forms for @xmath54 and @xmath1 would be @xmath83 $ ] , with @xmath31 a constant ( different for @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "this form differs only by the logarithmic term from that predicted in @xcite on the basis of a toy model .",
    "it should be noted that neither our present data nor that presented in @xcite can definitively rule out such logarithmic corrections , and the asympotic form of @xmath54 , as well as @xmath1 , can not be regarded as being definitively established . throughout the preasymptotic regime , however , the relation @xmath86^\\delta$ ] , with @xmath87 , holds rather well . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we plot the effective exponent @xmath88 directly as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "[ fig8 ] is remarkably similar to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the @xmath0 process .",
    "indeed , except for the earliest times , the corresponding curves differ by less by @xmath90 everywhere . in a similar way we can bound the asymptotic @xmath78 ( assuming that the late - time trend evident in fig .  [ fig8 ]",
    "continues ) by @xmath91 . since we have argued elsewhere @xcite , using a toy model , that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath3 is described by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we conjecture that the asymptotics of @xmath1 are given by @xmath92\\ , \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a constant and @xmath93 . for the @xmath0 model",
    ", we expressed [ eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) ] @xmath1 in terms of the ratio @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the diffusion constant of a tagged particle , @xmath14 is the diffusion constant of the other particles , and @xmath1 is the probability that the tagged particle remains uninfected at time @xmath2 . the analogous form for the @xmath4 process is naturally , @xmath96 \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is some unknown function .",
    "as before , the case @xmath34 corresponds to the problem of unvisited sites , so that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath35 , the case studied above , our conjecture implies @xmath100 .",
    "however , we stress that a logarithmic correction of the form discussed above can not be ruled out by the data . the main motivation for eq .  ( [ eq8 ] )",
    "is the toy model presented in @xcite , applied to the case @xmath34 .",
    "in this paper we have studied two distinct models : ( i ) a one - dimensional system of non - interacting , unbiased diffusing walkers @xmath0 , with random initial conditions and ( ii ) the @xmath4 diffusion limited process in one dimension with equal initial densities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles distributed homogeneously at @xmath7 .",
    "we have reduced the familiar study of persistent sites @xmath3 , to a limiting case in the study of uninfected walkers and shown numerically that in both models , @xmath101^\\gamma\\ , \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 for the time regimes covered by our data and @xmath103 for asymptotically large time .",
    "the common feature of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 processes is that the fraction of unvisited sites decays according to a stretched exponential ( possibly with logarithmic corrections for @xmath4 ) . in our earlier paper @xcite , we argued heuristically , on the basis of a toy model , that if the density of walkers decays asymptotically as @xmath104 , then the fraction of unvisited sites @xmath3 decays with a stretched exponential form if @xmath105 .",
    "we showed that @xmath106^{(1/2)-\\alpha } , \\qquad \\alpha < 1/2 \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is some function of @xmath107 .",
    "this result is consistent with the results for models studied here .",
    "remarkably , eq.([eq9 ] ) seems to hold for both the @xmath0 and the @xmath4 processes , with approximately the same bounds on @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the effective time - dependent value of @xmath10 is very similar for both models ( see figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "an obvious goal for the future is to try to obtain a theoretical understanding of this simple relationship , and test it against other models with @xmath108 .    for both models studied here we expressed the probability that a particle at site @xmath33 is uninfected in terms of its diffusion constant @xmath95 and the diffusion constant @xmath14 of the other particles [ eqs.([eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) ] , noting that @xmath3 corresponds to the limit @xmath34 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , we can generalize this description to any system of randomly diffusing particles for which the density decays as @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "we conjecture that , in this case , the fraction of uninfected walkers can be expressed , asymptotically , as @xmath111\\ , \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] with @xmath112 and @xmath113 some unknown function .",
    "clearly , there is much scope to test the validity of this form since we have only considered @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "note that for systems with @xmath116 , our toy model predicts @xcite that @xmath3 approaches a non - zero constant , while @xmath1 certainly behaves differently since it is bounded above by @xmath117 and must therefore vanish for large @xmath2 .",
    "more interesting , however , is the borderline case where the particle density falls off like @xmath118 . in this case , our toy model predicts that @xmath3 @xcite decays as a power - law , @xmath119 .",
