    "observations of ngc  6946 reveal a  filament that appears to connect it with its neighbors .",
    "morphologically this is similar to a predicted cold flow , but the similarity of the filament s dispersion timescale with the interaction timescale suggest that it has a tidal origin . while detecting",
    "an associated stellar stream would strongly suggest that this  filament is tidal in origin , the requisite observations do not yet exist .",
    "these observations illustrate the biggest problem in trying to identify cold flows via  emission , that is there are many plausible origins for features with similar properties .",
    "the best way to identify cold flows is statistically via a large survey .",
    "cold flows should preferentially exist around low mass galaxies in low density environments . tidal debris , on the other hand ,",
    "should exist preferentially around galaxies in high density environments .",
    "galactic outflows should preferentially exist around galaxies with low masses and large star formation rates .",
    "the ideal  survey would span a wide range of galaxy mass , environment , and star formation rates to discriminate between these different origins .",
    "such a survey is best done with single - dish radio telescopes that are large ( so that they have good angular resolution ) with low sidelobes ( so that there is no confusion with  emission from the galaxy itself ) and are extremely sensitive ( so that low column density features can be easily detected ) .",
    "the gbt remains the only telescope in the world that combines all of these features .",
    "pisano et al . ( 2014 , in preparation ) will report on the results from just such a gbt survey of the things galaxies @xcite .",
    "i wish to acknowledge the excellent staff at the green bank telescope for their work in keeping the telescope operating at a high level of performance and making it so easy to use .",
