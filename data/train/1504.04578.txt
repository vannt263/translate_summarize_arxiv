    "we create feshbach molecules using standard techniques of magneto - association across a feshbach resonance .",
    "as demonstrated in refs.@xcite , er features an enormous number of feshbach resonances . here , we focus on the resonances observed below @xmath24{g}$ ] .",
    "in particular , we first create an ultracold atomic sample of about @xmath150 @xmath14er atoms at a temperature of @xmath151{nk}$ ] , which is just above the onset of bose condensation , see ref.@xcite .",
    "the atoms are confined into a three - dimensional ( 3d ) crossed optical dipole trap with frequencies @xmath152{hz}$ ] , @xmath153{hz}$ ] , and @xmath154{hz}$ ] .",
    "we choose magnetic fields of @xmath155{g}$ ] , @xmath156{g}$ ] , and @xmath157{g}$ ] for the molecular states @xmath41 , @xmath52 , and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "we then magneto - associate molecules by ramping the magnetic field @xmath158{mg}$ ] below the feshbach resonance .",
    "the typical ramp speed is @xmath159{mg / ms}$ ] .",
    "after the molecule association , we remove all the residual atoms from the optical dipole trap by applying a short laser pulse .",
    "the pulse is on resonance with the strong atomic transition at @xmath160{nm}$ ]  @xcite and has a duration of @xmath161{\\mu s}$ ] with an intensity of @xmath162{mw / cm^2}$ ] .    to realize a q2d geometry , we superimpose a one dimensional optical lattice beam to the system after finishing evaporation in the 3d trap .",
    "the lattice is realized from a retro - reflected laser beam at @xmath163{nm}$ ] , propagating along the vertical direction .",
    "the beam has a waist of @xmath164{\\mu m}$ ] and a typical power of @xmath165{w}$ ] . as a result",
    ", the particles are confined into an array of q2d pancakes with frequencies @xmath166{hz}$ ] in the radial direction and @xmath147{khz}$ ] in the tightly confining axial direction .",
    "we first load the lattice from the atomic sample and we then magneto - associate er@xmath4 in the lattice .",
    "the molecule conversion efficiency in the q2d geometry is @xmath167{\\%}$ ] , which is below the one observed in the 3d trap . with this scheme",
    ", we produce about @xmath168 molecules at a temperature of @xmath32{nk}$ ] , corresponding to a density of @xmath169{cm^{-2}}$ ] .",
    "the molecules fill about @xmath170 lattice layers .",
    "we control the molecular dipole orientation by changing the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "the orientation is quantified in term of the angle @xmath98 , which defines the angle between the quantization axis , set by the magnetic field orientation , and the @xmath171-axis of the lattice trap .",
    "we prepare the molecular samples at either @xmath172 or @xmath173 , correspondingly side - by - side ( repulsive ) or head - to - tail ( attractive ) dipolar collisions .",
    "the magnetic field is rotated by using three pairs of independently - controlled magnetic - field coils .",
    "we pay particular attention that when changing the orientation of the magnetic field we keep its magnitude constant .",
    "we check this by performing radio - frequency spectroscopy between zeeman sub - levels for different angles of rotation .",
    "we typically rotate the field within @xmath174{ms}$ ] .    for all our loss - rate measurements , we jump to a magnetic field of about @xmath175{mg}$ ] after molecule association . at this field , @xmath176 is of the order of few @xmath177{mhz}$ ] .",
    "we choose to perform our measurement at this magnetic - field value because around @xmath175{mg}$ ] there are no feshbach resonances and the molecular spectrum might be less dense . using a stern - gerlach technique  @xcite , we measure @xmath1 at @xmath175{mg}$ ] for all the three target molecular states . we find a slight shift of @xmath1 in comparison with the values from table  ii of a few percent to @xmath178 for @xmath41 , @xmath179 for @xmath52 , and @xmath180 for @xmath67 .",
    "the given uncertainties for the measured loss rates in table  ii are composed of a statistical error with one standard deviation derived from fitting a two - body rate equation to the measured data , and a systematic uncertainty coming from number density calibration . due to the distribution of molecules across many lattice layers",
    "this is by far the greatest uncertainty in the q2d geometry .",
    "the average 2d density and its uncertainty was calculated using a number - weighted average over occupied lattice layers similar to ref.@xcite .",
    "when calculating the loss rate ratio @xmath181 , the systematic uncertainty in the density can be neglected as it is highly correlated for the measurement of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we briefly describe the theoretical formalism used in this article to determine the collisional properties of er@xmath4 molecules in free space ( 3d collisions ) and in an one - dimensional optical lattice ( q2d collisions ) , in an arbitrary magnetic field @xmath182 . more details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we use a time - independent quantum formalism based on spherical coordinates @xmath183 describing the relative motion of two er@xmath4 molecules .",
    "the quantization axis @xmath184 is chosen to be the confinement axis of the optical lattice .",
    "a spherical harmonic basis set , summed over different partial waves @xmath82 with projections @xmath185 on the quantization axis , is used to expand the total colliding wave function .",
    "the one dimensional optical lattice is supposed to be deep enough to consider the collision taking place in an individual pancake .",
    "one pancake is represented as an harmonic trap for the relative motion of reduced mass @xmath186 @xmath187 with @xmath188 and @xmath189{khz}$ ] .",
    "the 3d collisions are recovered by setting @xmath190 .",
    "we consider molecules in the ground state of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "a given state of an er@xmath4 feshbach molecule is described by a rather complicated linear combination of atomic states which can not be precisely calculated as mentioned in the next section of this supplemental material .",
    "therefore we consider that the molecule has a magnetic moment of magnitude @xmath1 aligned along the magnetic field which makes an angle @xmath98 with the confinement axis .",
    "the interaction between two molecules is provided by the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction @xmath191 we also used an isotropic er@xmath4 + er@xmath4 van der waals interaction given by @xmath192 with @xmath193{a.u.}$ ] which amounts to four times the value of an isotropic atom - atom coefficient of @xmath194{a.u.}$ ] from the theoretical work of ref.@xcite .",
    "note that an alternative value of @xmath195{a.u.}$ ] based on observed transitions was obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation is solved for each radial intermolecular separations @xmath196 using a log - derivative propagation method . matching the colliding wavefunction and its derivative with appropriate two - dimensional asymptotic boundary conditions at long - range@xcite provides the cross section and the rate coefficient as a function of the collision energy for any arbitrary configurations of magnetic fields and confinements . averaging the cross sections over a 3d and 2d dimensional maxwell - boltzmann distribution provides the corresponding thermalized rate coefficients @xmath106 for a given temperature .    at short range",
    ", we assume that the molecules undergo a full loss mechanism process with a unit probability ( it can be either an inelastic or a possible reactive process ) .",
    "this assumption , which corresponds to the so - called universal regime in ultracold collisions , considers that the physics is independent of the initial short - range scattering phase - shift  @xcite of the full potential energy surfaces of er@xmath111 .",
    "this is what it is usually assumed for theory as nothing is known about this potential energy surface at short range .",
    "then , if the magnitude of the rates differs between experiment and theory , one can learn that an experimental system deviates from this universal regime and short - range effects play a role .    to circumvent this ,",
    "it is more convenient to compute the ratio of the theoretical rates of two different magnetic field orientations since we will start with the same short - range physics condition for both orientations , and compare it with the corresponding experimental ratio .",
    "an analysis based on the universal behavior of dipolar collisions in confinement of ref.@xcite using a quantum threshold model leads to the following formula for the ratio @xmath197 . for bosons , using eq.30 of ref.@xcite to describe @xmath100 ( dipole dominated ) and eq.32 of the same reference for @xmath101 ( confinement dominated ) we find @xmath198 when @xmath139 for a fixed value of @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the thermal de broglie wavelength . for fermions , using eq.16 of ref.@xcite to describe @xmath100 ( dipole dominated ) and eq.14 of the same reference for @xmath101 ( van der waals dominated ) , along with eq.27 , we find @xmath201 when @xmath141 .",
    "these formulas suggest to plot the ratio as a function of @xmath202 for bosons for a fixed ratio @xmath203 and as a function of @xmath204 for fermions , as it has been done in fig.4 for the magnetic dipolar molecules of er@xmath4 and the electric polar molecules of krb .",
    "in ref.@xcite we presented the theoretical bosonic - erbium feshbach spectra derived from coupled - channels calculations .",
    "we concluded there that such first - principle evaluations can not quantitatively capture the complex scattering behavior of er . in fact with the current computing capabilities , the calculations can not be converged with respect to the number of basis states required to explain the experimental feshbach - resonance density .",
    "for this reason , we developed a novel approach based on adiabatic potentials ( adiabats ) @xmath76 .",
    "our adiabatic model starts from the hamiltonian @xmath205 .",
    "the first term is the radial kinetic - energy operator with @xmath206 describing the orientation and the separation between the two atomic dipoles , and @xmath207 is the reduced mass .",
    "the second term of the hamiltonian is the potential operator @xmath208 , which describes the zeeman and interatomic interactions .",
    "it reads @xmath209 and incorporates the rotational energy operator with molecular orbital angular momentum @xmath210 , the zeeman interaction of two atoms @xmath211 , and the electronic potential operator @xmath212 between the particles .",
    "our model assumes that the relative vibrational motion of two er atoms is slow compared to the timescales of the rotational , zeeman , and `` electronic '' atom - atom interactions .",
    "the zeeman interaction is @xmath213 . here , @xmath214 is the er g - factor , a magnetic field @xmath27 is aligned along the @xmath215 direction , and @xmath216 is the @xmath171 component of the angular momentum operator @xmath217 of atom @xmath218 .",
    "the electronic potential operator @xmath212 , described in refs.@xcite , is anisotropic , as it depends on the orientation of @xmath206 . at large separation @xmath80 , @xmath212 is given by the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction plus both the isotropic and anisotropic contribution of the van der waals interaction .",
    "for @xmath219 the interaction @xmath220 .",
    "the hamiltonian is evaluated in the basis @xmath221 , where @xmath222 and @xmath223 is a spherical harmonic .",
    "it conserves @xmath224 and parity @xmath225 .",
    "in addition , for bosonic isotopes @xmath226 .",
    "we focus on ultracold collisions between atomic states @xmath227 and , therefore , only include basis functions satisfying @xmath228 .",
    "we limit the included partial waves to even @xmath229 and thus to states with even @xmath39 , as the `` adiabatic '' magnetic moments of the resonances quickly converge with the included number of partial waves ( in our calculation there is one @xmath12-wave channel , four @xmath0-wave channels , nine @xmath90-wave channels , and 16 @xmath91-wave channels . ) .",
    "the adiabats @xmath76 with @xmath78 are eigenvalues of the operator @xmath208 at a given field strength @xmath27 .",
    "their eigenfunctions are @xmath77 with @xmath80-dependent coefficients @xmath79 .",
    "note that we neglect the coupling between @xmath76 due to the radial part of kinetic - energy operator .",
    "figure  [ fig : adiabat ] shows the adiabats at @xmath230{g}$ ] .",
    "the scattering starts from the @xmath12-wave entrance channel correlating to the energetically lowest adiabat .",
    "all other potentials either have a centrifugal barrier and dissociate to two atoms with @xmath231 , or dissociate to closed - channel zeeman sublevels with @xmath232 .",
    "we distinguish four groups of potentials , each associated with a dominant partial wave @xmath82 . within a group ,",
    "the potentials are split by the zeeman energy and the magnetic ddi and dissociate at different atomic thresholds .",
    "for each potential @xmath76 we can further assign the dominant @xmath39 and @xmath83 , where @xmath222 is the sum of electronic angular momenta of two atoms and @xmath83 is the projection of @xmath39 on the internuclear axis .",
    "the figure also shows an example of predominantly @xmath0-wave feshbach molecules with an outer classical turning point @xmath37 .",
    "its `` adiabatic '' molecular magnetic moment is to good approximation given by @xmath233 , where we further use that most of the vibrational wavefunction is localized around @xmath37 .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the @xmath234 value quickly converges with the number of included @xmath82 ( even @xmath235 is sufficient ) and that it strongly depends on the ddi but only weakly on the vdw dispersion potential .",
    "in fact , at @xmath37 the ddi dominates over the anisotropic part of the dispersion potential .    .",
    "the calculation is performed at @xmath27 = 2.44 g with @xmath236 and includes only states with even @xmath237 .",
    "the zero of energy is at the dissociation limit of two @xmath238 atoms .",
    "black , green , red , and blue curves indicate the dominant @xmath82-wave character .",
    "the horizontal black line indicates a @xmath0-wave feshbach molecule with an outer turning point @xmath239 resonant with the @xmath12-wave entrance channel .",
    "panel ( b ) also shows the @xmath83 projection for each of the zeeman dissociation limit . ]    the adiabatic magnetic moment of a resonance is given by @xmath240 , where we realize that to good approximation most of the adiabatic vibrational wavefunction is localized around the outer classical turning point .",
    "we further note that @xmath241 from the hellmann - feyman theorem and , hence , @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the total atomic projection quantum number of state @xmath81 .",
    "we assign a resonance by the quantum numbers of the basis state @xmath81 for which @xmath244 is largest and note that the absolute value of the magnetic moment of a resonance is always smaller that @xmath245 .",
    "we further assume that the non - adiabatic coupling between the adiabatic potentials is significantly smaller than their spacings for @xmath246 .",
    "then a weakly bound level of adiabatic potential @xmath247 can lead to a feshbach resonance when its energy @xmath248 coincides with the entrance channel energy .",
    "the outer turning point @xmath37 of this level satisfies @xmath249 .",
    "the resonance acquires a width due to non - adiabatic coupling to the entrance channel .",
    "finally , we determine the approximate quantum numbers of experimentally - observed resonances with @xmath250 g , listed in table  i , based on a comparison of the experimental magnetic moment with those predicted by the adiabatic model at the same resonant field .",
    "we find that for these resonances there exist adiabats with a magnetic moment that agrees within 1% uncertainty with the experimental values .",
    "a study of the largest coefficients @xmath79 at @xmath86 then enables us to assign the dominant quantum states shown in table  i.    figure  2 ( main text ) shows the magnetic - field dependence of the adiabatic magnetic moment at the entrance channel energy for each of the adiabatic potentials @xmath76 .",
    "we see that for @xmath251 g the magnetic moment values equal integer multiples of @xmath93 corresponding to those of the atomic limits . for smaller field strengths",
    "the adiabatic magnetic moments show mixing of the zeeman sublevels . here",
    ", the magnetic moment value depends on the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction but only weakly on the strength and anisotropy of the dispersion potential .",
    "the figure also shows our experimentally studied feshbach resonance locations as well as their magnetic moments @xmath252 ; see table  i."
