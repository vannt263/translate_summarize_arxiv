    "stochasticity appears to be a hallmark of many biological processes involved in signal transduction and gene regulation @xcite . over the past decade ,",
    "there have been numerous experimental and theoretical efforts to understand the functional roles of noise in various living systems @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the building block of different regulatory programs is often a simple two - state switch under the regulation of some noisy input signal .",
    "for example , a gene network is composed of many interacting genes , each of which is a single switch regulated by specific transcription factors . at a synapse , switching of ligand - gated ion channels are responsible for converting the presynaptic chemical message into postsynaptic electrical signals , while the opening and closing of each channel depends on the binding of certain ligands ( such as a neurotransmitter ) . in bacterial chemotaxis ,",
    "the cellular motion is powered by multiple flagellar motors and each motor rotates clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the level of specific response regulator ( e.g. , chey - p in _ e. coli _ ) .",
    "irrespective of the context , the input signal , i.e. , the number of regulatory molecules , is usually stochastic due to discreteness , diffusion , random birth and death .",
    "how does a biological switching system work in a noisy environment ? this is the central question we attempt to address in this paper .",
    "previous studies on this topic have usually focused on the approximate , static relationship between input and output variations ( e.g. , the _ additive noise rule _ ) @xcite , while the dynamic details ( e.g. , dwell time statistics ) of the switching system have often been ignored .",
    "our recent work suggests that there is more to comprehend even in the simplest switching system @xcite .",
    "for example , we showed that increasing input noise does not always lead to an increase in the output variation , disagreeing with the _ additive noise rule _ as derived from the coarse - grained langevin approach .",
    "traditional methods often use a single langevin equation to approximate the joint input - output process , and relies on the assumption that the input noise is small enough such that one can linearize input - dependent nonlinear reaction rates .",
    "our approach to this problem is quite different as we explicitly model how the input stochastic process drives the output switch , without making any small noise assumption .    in our previous paper @xcite , the input signal was generated from a discrete birth - death process and regulated the on transition of a downstream switch . by explicitly solving the joint master equation of the system",
    ", we found that input fluctuations can effectively reduce the on rate of the switch . in this paper , this problem is revisited in a continuous noise formulation .",
    "we propose to model the input signal as a general diffusion process , which is mean - reverting , nonnegative , and tunable in fano factor ( the ratio of variance to mean ) .",
    "we employ the feynman - kac theorem to calculate the input - dependent dwell time distribution and examine its asymptotic behavior in different scenarios . within this new framework",
    ", we recover several findings reported in @xcite , and also demonstrate how the noise - induced suppression depends on the relative noise level as well as the relative input - to - output timescale .",
    "finally , we elaborate on how the diffusion process introduced in this paper can be a reasonable approximation of the discrete birth - death process .",
    "the input of our model , denoted by @xmath0 , represents a specific chemical concentration at time @xmath1 and directly governs the transition rates of a downstream switch .",
    "the binary on - off states of the switch in continuous time constitute the output process , @xmath2 .",
    "a popular choice for @xmath0 is the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process due to its analytical simplicity and mean - reverting property @xcite .",
    "however , this process does not rule out negative values , an unphysical feature for modeling chemical concentrations .",
    "for both mathematical convenience and biophysical constraints ( see section iv for more details ) , we model @xmath0 by a square - root diffusion process @xcite : @xmath3dt+\\sigma\\sqrt{x(t)}dw_t , \\label{cir}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 represents the rate at which @xmath0 reverts to its mean level @xmath5 , @xmath6 controls the noise intensity , and @xmath7 denotes the standard brownian motion .",
    "this simple process is known as the cox - ingersoll - ross ( cir ) model of interest rates @xcite . the square - root noise term",
    "not only ensures that the process never goes negative but also captures a common statistical feature underlying many biochemical processes , that is , the standard deviation of the copy number of molecules scales as the square root of the copy number , as dictated by the _ central limit theorem_. solving the fokker - planck equation for eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we obtain the steady - state distribution of the input signal : @xmath8 which is a gamma distribution with stationary variance @xmath9 .",
    "this is another attractive aspect of this model , since the protein abundance from gene expression experiments can often be fitted by a gamma distribution @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be interpreted as the _ signal - to - noise ratio _ , since @xmath11 . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the zero point is guaranteed to be inaccessible for @xmath0 .",
    "the other shape parameter @xmath13 sets the fano factor as we have @xmath14 . using the it calculus @xcite , one can also find the steady - state covariance : @xmath15=\\sigma_x^2 e^{-\\lambda|s|}$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath0 is a stationary process with correlation time @xmath16 .    [",
    "0.42 ] represents the input signal which fluctuates around a mean level over time ; @xmath2 records the switch process which flips between the off ( @xmath17 ) and on ( @xmath18 ) states with transition rates @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the dwell time in the off state.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in reality , the output switching rates may depend on the input @xmath0 in complicated ways , depending on the detailed molecular mechanism . for analytical convenience , we assume that the on and off transition rates of the switch are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) . as a result",

    "the current modeling framework may also be generalized to incorporate other biological features such as ultrasensitivity and feedbacks .",
    "work along these lines is underway ."
