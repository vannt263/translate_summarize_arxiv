    "the cosmological evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) can be inferred from the luminosity density of the galaxy population seen at different redshifts ( madau et al .",
    "indeed the luminosity density history traces the _ global _ evolution of the galaxy population , or in other words , of the whole content of galaxies ( gas , stars , dust , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , supernovae remnants , etc . ) , and not simply of the stellar population . recovering the _ genuine shape _ of the sfr history is essential to differentiate between scenarios of galaxy evolution and formation .",
    "extensive studies of nearby galaxies have shown that the uv , fir , radio continuum and h@xmath0 line fluxes are closely connected ( buat 1992 ) , even though these radiations are produced by different physical processes .",
    "thus they originate from a common photoionizing spectrum . retrieving the _ absolute",
    "_ photoionizing flux depends crucially on the understanding of these processes .",
    "assuming there is no agn , the galactic uv continuum radiation directly traces the uv stellar spectra . from the lyman break ( 912  ) to @xmath5 3500  , the emissivity of the starburst galaxy population becomes less dominated by the relatively massive , young stars ( o , b types , t@xmath610 000 k , m@xmath7 m@xmath8 , t@xmath910@xmath10 yr ) , while it becomes more dominated by the intermediate mass stars ( a type , m@xmath11 m@xmath8 , t@xmath12 yr ) .",
    "the emissivity of the more quiescent galaxy population ( i.e. ellipticals ) may be dominated by massive , old stars ( t@xmath13 10@xmath14 yr ) , but other possibilities , of which some are non stellar , have been proposed to account for the uv rise seen in these galaxies .",
    "assuming there is no agn , the h@xmath0(@xmath15  ) fluxes come from the hydrogen gas surrounding very massive , short - lived stars ( ob type , t@xmath5 60 000 k , m@xmath16 m@xmath8 , t@xmath17 yr ) .",
    "the gas is directly excited by far - uv stellar photons shorter than 912  , and its recombination produces spectral emission lines . of the balmer lines ,",
    "h@xmath0 is the most proportional to the far - uv stellar spectra , because it is the easiest to ionize , and is barely , if at all , affected by the stellar absorption due to old stars .",
    "moreover , it does not depend on the metal fraction present in the gas , or on the hardness of the ionizing stellar spectrum ( which is the case for metal lines e.g. [ o  ii]@xmath183727 ) .",
    "the global contribution of these stellar populations depends mainly on the shape of the initial mass function ( imf ) and its mass cut - off , the average age and metallicity , and the luminosity function ( lf ) of the galaxy population considered .",
    "uncertainties arise for ellipticals , for which the uv source is not fully understood .",
    "fluxes for galaxies dominated by an old stellar population are likely to be affected by stellar absorption . however , in the studies of global evolution of the galaxy population , the starburst galaxies dominate the uv radiation , and so the remaining galaxies are unlikely to affect the general results .    recovering the _ absolute _ sfr from uv continuum and h@xmath0 line flux measurements depends on the dust extinction , which is subject to debate . indeed massive - star formation occurs in dusty molecular clouds ; most of the uv radiation is reprocessed by dust and emitted in the far infra - red .",
    "h@xmath0 , and uv fluxes arise from relatively late stages of star formation ( @xmath19 yr ) , when the star - forming region becomes less opaque . in the optical , different extinction laws behave similarly , thus retrieving the original h@xmath0 fluxes is not a major problem . in the uv , which is more dust affected , they can differ by a large factor .",
    "thus , it leads to large uncertainties in the absolute uv radiation .",
    "but , long - lived stars as traced by the near - uv , sit in less obscured regions than short - lived stars as traced by h@xmath0 .",
    "this is corrobated by the fact that extinction measurements from the uv stellar continuum are found to be no larger ( as expected by any extinction laws ) than from the optical h@xmath0/h@xmath20 decrement . consequently",
    ", the observed near - uv is dominated by intermediate mass stars not only because they are more numerous and longer - lived than massive stars , but also because they are much less dust obscured . in summary ,",
    "h@xmath0 and near - uv radiations emerge in average from different environments within a galaxy , because each is dominated by different stellar populations and time scales ( see e.g. calzetti et al .",
    "nevertheless , they are tightly correlated ( buat et al .",
    "1987 ) - asserting the universality of the upper imf limit .",
    "the relationships between quantities have been extensively studied in the nearby universe .",
    "however , we need to ascertain these physical parameters with cosmic time .",
    "clearly the emissivity of galaxies evolves with redshift , but is the stellar content entirely responsible ? or does the dust extinction vary ? does the agn contribution increase ? we need to answer these questions before getting the correct shape of the sfr .",
    "this is essential not only for including these processes in evolutionary models , but also for quantifying how much it affects the galaxy selection in deep surveys .",
    "correlating h@xmath0 and uv at any redshift is a powerful way to tackle the dust uncertainties .",
    "h@xmath0 is seen in the optical up to @xmath21 .",
    "prospective instruments in the near infra - red will soon enable systematic studies of h@xmath0 and uv radiation within the _ same _ galaxy sample at @xmath22 .",
    "this will avoid discrepancies inherent to comparing different surveys . with the i - selected cfrs galaxies up to @xmath23",
    ", we measured the dust - corrected h@xmath0 luminosities , and obtained a h@xmath0 luminosity function ( see tresse & maddox 1998 for further details ) .",
    "we used the factors from madau et al .",
    "1998 ( salpeter imf , 0.1@xmath1125 m@xmath24 ) to convert our h@xmath0 luminosity density at @xmath25 of 10@xmath26 erg / s / mpc@xmath27 into a @xmath28 . at @xmath29 ,",
    "the b - band barely samples the rest - frame uv .",
    "thus we could not compare directly our h@xmath0 determination with a uv one without extrapolation , which is likely to introduce untestable uncertainties .",
    "however the b - band of cfrs galaxies at @xmath30 allowed the determination of the rest - frame near - uv(2800  ) .",
    "if we consider the evolution of the cfrs luminosity density at 2800   of @xmath31 ( h@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , as defined in lilly et al .",
    "1996 , then the @xmath35 from uv(2800  ) at @xmath3 should be @xmath36 . assuming that all parameters are correct ( imf , stellar populations , no agn , case b recombination , etc . ) and that the slope @xmath0 for the star - forming lfs is constant , then the uv(2800 ) fluxes are low by a factor @xmath52.5 ( or 1 mag ) at @xmath3 . we interpret this as the dust correction required for these uv measurements .",
    "we note that our _ average _ dust correction from the h@xmath0/h@xmath20 decrement is a@xmath37 1 mag , which is of the same order as we derived for the uv(2800  ) magnitudes at @xmath38 .",
    "this result is similar to local observations as discussed in section 2 .",
    "we find that b - band luminosities are tightly correlated to h@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "this is as the correlation between uv and h@xmath0 ; the b band is still dominated by young stars ( type a ) .",
    "this surely reinforces the hypothesis of a universal imf : for a certain amount of massive ob stars formed , there is always the same among of intermediate mass , type a , stars .",
    "we find @xmath39 , with the luminosities l(h@xmath0 ) being dust corrected , but not the b magnitudes .",
    "if the latter are corrected , according our results , a dust correction of 0.6 mag in average ( seaton s law assumed ) should be taken .",
    "this relation implies that surveys at high @xmath40 , which select preferentially bright , star - forming galaxies , are also likely to pick up only the strongest h@xmath0 emitters . we do not find a correlation between h@xmath0 luminosities , and the rest - frame colors ( @xmath41 )",
    "this endorses the idea that h@xmath0 production depends mainly on the `` instantaneous '' star formation , or in other words , on the time scale since the last burst .",
    "the h@xmath0 lf is related to the number of ionizing photons emitted by massive stars .",
    "since the latter have a short life ( @xmath42 yr ) , their number traces the `` instantaneous '' sfr .",
    "the sfr deduced only from h@xmath0 luminosities is very dependent on the assumed imf , since only the massive stars are traced .",
    "the slope of the h@xmath0 lf depends more on the time scale since the last star bursts , rather than on the sfr .",
    "a fading process of h@xmath0 photons produces a non flat slope .",
    "the shallower the imf , the slower is the fading process , and steeper is the slope ( hogg & phinney 1997 ) . because of the tight relation between b or uv magnitudes , and h@xmath0 luminosities , the slope in b- and uv - band lfs",
    "must be correlated to the slope of the h@xmath0 lf .",
    "we note that for the luminosity density history ( madau et al .",
    "1998 , lilly et al . 1996 ) , a constant slope for star - forming galaxies has been assumed ( @xmath43 ) at all redshifts , i.e. a constant fraction of dwarf galaxies has been considered . if the merging rate , and/or the sfr are not constant through cosmic time as predicted , this assumption has to be revised .",
    "the sfr history is deduced from the luminosity densities , @xmath44 ; a @xmath45 evolution in @xmath46 , or in @xmath47 , is approximatively equivalent to a slope evolution of @xmath48 .",
    "the best fit for our h@xmath0 lf is @xmath49 , @xmath50 mpc@xmath51 , and @xmath52 erg s@xmath53 .",
    "we point out that the tight relation found between b or uv magnitudes , and h@xmath0 luminosities validates our use of a magnitude - selected survey , like the cfrs , to measure the h@xmath0 lf .",
    "we did not exclude the agn galaxies from our sample to be able to compare our result to the cfrs rest - frame uv data ( contrarily to gallego et al .",
    "there are many problems arising if agn are excluded . in principle",
    ", they should be excluded , but in practice , it requires an _ objective _ technique to do so at all redshifts , in particular for the narrow - line agn .",
    "moreover , observing the whole galaxy content ( or part of ) as done in deep redshift surveys , blurs the objective line - ratio classification because different stellar and dust contents within individual galaxies are sampled , which leads to overlap between agn and starbursts ( see tresse et al .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath0 fluxes observed from an agn galaxy is produced both by the agn and the h  ii regions .",
    "the contribution of each ionizing source to the h@xmath0 flux is unknown . thus removing agn galaxies from a sample",
    "underestimates the total h@xmath0 flux produced by stars .",
    "conversely including them provides an upper - limit of h@xmath0 luminosities produced by stars .",
    "also , if merging processes trigger nuclear activity , then excluding agn may lead to the exclusion of this class of galaxies .",
