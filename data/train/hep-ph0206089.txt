    "until recently there were two types of models of interactions which were considered plausible while investigating the source of the cp violation @xcite .",
    "the miliweak models which assume that a part of order @xmath3 in the weak interaction was responsible for the observed cp violation effects .",
    "one of the most important predictions of this class of models is that the cp violation should be observed also in other than @xmath4 processes , and that it should be of the same order .",
    "the ckm model is an example of such miliweak models , at the same time being the most successful one .",
    "the recent experimental results concerning the measurement of @xmath5 and the @xmath0 violation in the neutral @xmath6-meson system show , that the ckm model correctly describes the @xmath0 violation .",
    "there is , however , a small possibility that a superweak - like interaction does exist , and some authors consider its implications ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present paper we consider an effect which would be present , if the superweak interaction , or an interaction of a similar nature ( the terms superweak and superweak - like will be used interchangeably ) , really existed in nature in addition to the ckm mechanism .",
    "we find , that the standard weisskopf - wigner approach to studying the @xmath4 process is not sensitive enough for the study of such an interaction , and therefore we choose the krolikowski - rzewuski approach @xcite-@xcite and its extensions to the neutral kaon system suggested in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section we review the most important ( for our purposes ) features of the standard model and the superweak model and their present experimental status .",
    "the third section reviews the standard phenomenological approach to the neutral kaon system , which is based on the weisskopf - wigner approach .",
    "also , basing on @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , we review an alternative formalism and analyze its relevance to the superweak - like interaction .",
    "the fourth section contains a computer simulation of the time dependence of one of the parameters introduced in the alternative model , namely the difference of the diagonal elements of the effective hamiltonian , which in the presence of the superweak interaction turns out to be different from zero .",
    "the summary and conclusions are contained in the last section .",
    "in this section we quickly review the standard model approach to the @xmath7 .",
    "we also briefly describe the salient features of the superweak scenario of @xmath0 violation .",
    "the flavour transitions allowed in the standard model are specified by the ckm matrix , which allows the following flavour mixing : @xmath9 consequently , to the lowest order transitions @xmath4 can proceed through the diagrams presented in figure fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] .",
    "diagrams corresponding to the @xmath10 process . ]    in the ckm theory there are no direct , first order @xmath4 transitions . in other words",
    "there are no first order @xmath1 transitions , or , in yet another equivalent formulation , which we will be using in the remaining part of the paper : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the flavour - changing part of the weak hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "matrix [ ckm ] is unitary and contains @xmath15 parameters .",
    "three of these parameters may be chosen to be real angles @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and",
    "the remaining six are phases . the number of phases can be reduced by using the fact , that spinors are defined up to a phase , so we may redefine the quark eigenstates . after doing this",
    "we notice , that in the procedure there are only five independent phase differences , whereas there are six phases in [ ckm ] , so there is one physically meaningful phase in this unitary matrix .",
    "this is the crucial point of the @xmath19 theory because this phase allows for @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "the superweak model postulates the existence of a new @xmath1 interaction , which violates cp .",
    "the coupling constant of this interaction should be smaller than second order weak interaction .",
    "thus , the superweak model assumes a non - vanishing first order transition matrix element : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the superweak coupling constant .",
    "it is widely accepted that this interaction can only be detected in the @xmath22 , because it is the only known pair of states with the energy difference so small , that it is sensitive to interactions weaker than second order weak interaction @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental results from the cplear and ktev collaborations and others have given the decisive answer to the question whether the cp violation effects are correctly described by the @xmath19 miliweak theory .",
    "the measured value of @xmath23 @xcite proves that there is a direct cp violating effect , and that cp violation can not only be ascribed to mass mixing in the @xmath4 process . on the contrary",
    ": the ckm must be the dominant source of @xmath0 violation ( in low - energy flavour - changing processes)@xcite .",
    "additionally , the measured value is perfectly consistent with the world average for the value @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "another experimental argument for the miliweak ckm theory are the two recent measurements of @xmath0 violation in @xmath6 decays ( @xcite and references therein ) . in other words ,",
    "the standard model alone is able to correctly predict the value of @xmath5 and no improvements or extensions are in fact necessary .",
    "however , even if the cp violation effects are described by the ckm the the idea of a @xmath1 interaction has not been abandoned entirely .",
    "indeed , some authors consider the implications of such an interaction - the question of the existence of the superweak interaction turns out to be of some importance in the `` tagged '' experiments in which the flavour is determined for the initial meson and then the for the meson at the time of decay",
    ". the existence of the @xmath1 superweak interaction might cause the production of the `` wrong '' neutral meson states @xcite .",
    "the effect of this hypothetical interaction is believed to be negligibly small as it would add to the @xmath4 mixing .    in the remaining part of the paper",
    "we want to discuss the implications of this hypothetical interaction for the time evolution of the @xmath24 complex in the case of @xmath25 conservation in view of the recent experimental facts .",
    "we show that if we want to assume the existence of such an interaction then we can no longer use the loy approximation .",
    "we also address the question of how this kind of interaction could have observable effects in the decay of the neutral mesons .",
    "the size of the effects introduced by the new , hypothetical interaction is also investigated , with the assumption that the recent experimental results and their interpretation are correct . to achieve this goal",
    "we will use a different approach than the loy approximation , namely , a formalism based on the krlikowski - rzewuski equation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the phenomenology which is currently used to describe the time evolution of the @xmath24 system .",
    "this formalism is based on the formalism of particle mixture introduced by gell - mann and pais @xcite .",
    "the most important modification to this formalism was introduced by lee , oehme and yang @xcite , who , using the weisskopf - wigner approximation arrived at the formula ( [ mixingmatrix ] ) - see below - which is currently used .",
    "further extensions were introduced by many other authors , e.g. bell and steinberger @xcite .    in the standard approach",
    "the full hamiltonian is divided into two parts : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the flavour - conserving part of the hamiltonian , and @xmath14 is the flavour - changing part .",
    "the complete state vector which has evolved from @xmath28 or @xmath29 is projected onto the subspace spanned by @xmath30 can be described by the following schrdinger - like equation : @xmath31 where we have adopted @xmath32 and the matrix elements are matrix elements of the weak interaction transition operator . in the case of @xmath25 conserved it can be shown , that for this effective hamiltonian we have @xmath33 , but we have no information on @xmath34 or @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can be split into two parts , each of them with a definite physical meaning , namely : @xmath36 or @xmath37 the diagonal entries bear no indices , as we want to further emphasize the main result of the loy approach , namely @xmath33 .    for our purposes , which is the analysis of the influence of the hypothetical @xmath1 interaction on the time development of the @xmath24 system ,",
    "the loy method is not suitable . indeed , in @xcite , @xcite it was shown ,",
    "that the loy formulae may only be correct if we assume @xmath38 and take @xmath39 .",
    "this obviously excludes the possibility of using the lee , oehme and yang approximation in studying a hypothetical superweak interaction      one alternative to the approach described above is the formalism developed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "we will briefly review this approximation and its basic findings .",
    "the starting point of the derivation of an alternative effective hamiltonian carried out in @xcite is the krlikowski - rzewuski equation @xcite . in this approach the time evolution",
    "is not studied in the total space of states @xmath40 but rather in a closed subspace @xmath41 . if we define the following projector :    @xmath42 then the subspace @xmath43 may be defined as @xmath44 or @xmath45 . in this way",
    "the total state space is split into two orthogonal subspaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the shrdinger equation can be replaced by equations describing each of the subspaces respectively .",
    "the equation for @xmath46 has the following form @xcite : @xmath48 @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath52 following @xcite we introduce an effective hamiltonian : @xmath53 this formula corresponds to ( [ hloy ] ) , which also specifies an effective hamiltonian .",
    "now , the main difference between the standard lee , oehme and yang approximation and this approach is the effective potential .",
    "it can be shown that @xcite : @xmath54 to establish notation let us now define the following symbols : @xmath55 , \\ ] ] @xmath56    the matrix elements @xmath57 of @xmath58 ( [ vpara ] ) , without assuming any symmetries , like @xmath59=0 $ ] or @xmath60=0 $ ] @xcite are : @xmath61 @xmath62    where @xmath63    and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "this effective potential , together with the remaining parts of the effective hamiltonian yields the following matrix elements for the effective hamiltonian : @xmath66 for the @xmath60=0 $ ] case the formulae simplify as @xmath67 in this case    now , it is easy to notice that , in the case of @xmath60=0 $ ] , contrary to the loy effective hamiltonian for which we have @xmath68 , the difference between the diagonal elements is non - vanishing :    @xmath69    it is also obvious that the necessary condition for ( [ inequal ] ) to be true is @xmath70 , that is , the existence a superweak interaction .",
    "in this section we perform a numerical simulation of the @xmath71 parameter , which has proved so important in the present approach . by making some assumptions concerning the scale of the hypothetical superweak interaction we arrive at a form which is convenient for computer analysis .",
    "we also provide figures demonstrating the time evolution of the module and real and imaginary part of this parameter .      in @xcite",
    "the friedrichs - lee model was used to obtain the following formulae for the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian with the assumption @xmath60=0 $ ] : @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 in these formulae @xmath76 , compare eq.([hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath77 ; @xmath78 is the difference between the mass of the mesons considered and the threshold energy of the continuum state , like @xmath79 .",
    "functions @xmath80 are defined by : @xmath81 where @xmath82-\\ ] ] @xmath83,\\ ] ] @xmath84 and finally @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the sine and cosine fresnel integrals : @xmath87 @xmath88 the parameters @xmath89 correspond to the matrix elements of the decay matrix in the loy approximation ( [ mixingmatrix ] ) .    by setting @xmath90 in ( [ hajeden ] ) and @xmath91 in ( [ hadwa ] ) and then substracting ( [ hadwa ] ) from ( [ hajeden])we get : @xmath92.\\ ] ] using a new independent variable @xmath93 , defined in appendix a we can rewrite @xmath71 as : @xmath94 where @xmath95 has the following form ( see appendix a ) : @xmath96   \\right . \\label{pelnadelta}\\ ] ] @xmath97 \\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath98   \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath99 \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    in spite of its complicated appearance , expression ( [ pelnadelta ] ) is simple to analyze using computer methods as it contains no other variables but the independent variable @xmath93 .    to extract any numerical information from ( [ pelnadelta ] ) we need to make some assumptions concerning the strength of the superweak interaction",
    "there are some estimates in the literature - we will accept the one suggested by lee in @xcite ( equation 15.138 , page 375 ) : @xmath100 . to be sure ,",
    "we do not even know if the strength is different from zero - we are assuming _ a _ value of @xmath101 which is consistent with the assumptions made in section 2 . to see how @xmath71 changes with time .",
    "below we present three figures : the time dependence of @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 - where @xmath106 and @xmath107 stand for the real and imaginary parts , respectively - which are proportional to the corresponding parameters connected with @xmath108 , because from ( [ defhz ] ) , ( [ defdelta ] ) we have ( see appendix a ) : @xmath109    the figures correspond to the value of @xmath101=@xmath110 .     the change of @xmath111 in the logarithmic scale for the value @xmath112 . ]     the change of @xmath113 $ ] for long times in the logarithmic scale for @xmath112 . ]     the change of @xmath114 $ ] for long times in the logarithmic scale for @xmath112 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : log17 ] we show the time dependence of the module of @xmath95 , which is basically the same as @xmath115 this figure is in the logarithmic scale - we can see , that the parameter @xmath95 oscillates around the constant value of around @xmath116.the imaginary part rapidly tends to zero .",
    "therefore the real part of @xmath117 is responsible for the non - vanishing of @xmath115 - this is clearly seen in fig  [ fig : rehz17 ] .    in the standard approach the real parts of the diagonal elements of the effective hamiltonian",
    "are interpreted as the masses of the particles .",
    "therefore it seems that the existence of the superweak interaction would remove the mass degeneracy between the particle and antiparticle in the neutral kaon system .",
    "correspondingly , the imaginary parts are interpreted as the decay constants , so in the model considered the decay widths of the particle and antiparticle should be equal , which is consistent with the standard result .",
    "these results are consistent with the conclusions reached earlier on the basis of the form of @xmath71 for large times - see appendix b.      in this short subsection we try to estimate the order of magnitude of the effect introduced by the hypothetical superweak - like interaction . to this end",
    "we use the assumption , that the dominating contribution to @xmath118 is correctly described by the standard model .",
    "this means that we may assume @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the fermi constant , @xmath121 is the proton mass and @xmath122 is the cabbio angle @xcite .",
    "using our result form the previous section , @xmath123 and equation [ delta ] we get the following upper bound on our parameter : @xmath124 this value corresponds to the presently measured @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "obviously , the effect calculated in the present paper is much too small to be observed with the present , and possibly also future , experiments . with this result",
    ", the question of the utility of the very concept of the superweak interaction arises .",
    "in the present paper the influence of the hypothetical superweak interaction on the time evolution of the neutral kaon complex has been studied .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the effective hamiltonian on the very existence of such an interaction and found , that the standard weisskopf - wigner approach , used for example by lee , oehme and yang @xcite may only be correct if we assume the nonexistence of this interaction .",
    "this is the reason for choosing another approach , namely the formalism based on the krolikowski - rzewuski equation @xcite-@xcite , which makes no such assumptions and is sensitive to the existence of the first order @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the two approaches have been shown to be equivalent in e.g. @xcite in the absence of this interaction , but its inclusion leads to a prediction which is different from the generally accepted result .",
    "the computer simulation of the time dependence of the parameter @xmath126 , corresponding to the difference of the diagonal elements of the effective hamiltonian , presented in section 5 . shows , that this parameter is different from zero and basically constant .",
    "another result of this section is that it is the real part which is responsible for the non - vanishing @xmath126 , as the imaginary part very rapidly tends to zero .",
    "all these results would be impossible to reach without the krolikowski - rzewuski approach , further developed in @xcite-@xcite , as the standard method due to lee , oehme and yang is insensitive to the superweak interaction .",
    "the prediction of the standard lee - oehme and yang states that the real parts of the diagonal elements of the effective hamiltonian governing the time evolution of the neutral kaon system should be equal . in the usual interpretation",
    ", the real parts of the diagonal elements correspond to the masses of the particles and hence the masses of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are equal . in the approach assumed in the present paper",
    "the real parts of the effective halimtonian are equal on condition that there is no superweak interaction .",
    "the result of the present paper , and many others @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , is that mathematically the difference between the masses of particles and antiparticles needs not be equal to zero , if we assume the standard identification of the diagonal elements of the effective hamiltonian plus the existence of the superweak - like interaction .",
    "however , even if this mathematical property of the effective hamiltonian were to produce some results which are meaningful for the experiment , sensitivity of the instruments would have exceed the present day experiments by a few orders of magnitude ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "naturally , the question of the utility of the theory developed above should be raised .",
    "it is quite possible , that this formalism and the numerical results may only be used to confirm the standard result laid out in @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that all the results obtained in the present paper are consistent with the standard model and the recent experimental findings .",
    "we have been assuming , that even if there is a cp violating @xmath1 interaction , the @xmath2 complex is correctly described by the standard model to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "this is the reason for assuming @xmath112 in section 5 . and",
    "@xmath129 in section 4.3 .",
    "i would like to thank professor krzysztof urbanowski for many helpful discussions .",
    "by rewriting the @xmath130 and @xmath131 parameters as : @xmath132 @xmath133 we may cast @xmath71 in the following form : @xmath134 @xmath135 = \\ ] ] @xmath136.\\ ] ]    it is easy to notice , that if @xmath137 we have @xmath138 , but this case corresponds exactly to the @xmath0 conserved case - compare @xcite page 3743 .",
