    "statistical decision problems in engineering applications require to perform state estimation of a dynamic system under uncertainty as to signal presence @xcite .",
    "this includes fault detection and diagnosis in a dynamical system control @xcite , target detection and tracking @xcite , image and speech segmentation @xcite , speaker identification and source separation , blind deconvolution of communication channels .",
    "application of sequential decision rules to the above scenario arouses much interest since it promises a considerable gain in sensitivity , measured by the reduction in the average sample number ( asn ) , with respect to fixed sample size ( fss ) procedures .",
    "these advantages are particularly attractive in remote radar surveillance , where the signal amplitude is weak compared to the background noise and stringent detection specifications can be met only by processing multiple frames as in @xcite ) . in this case , fss techniques usually result to be inefficient while sequential procedures are known to increase the sensitivity of power - limited systems or , alternatively , to reduce the asn .",
    "the adoption of sequential procedures , however , poses some difficulties : since the instant when the procedure stops sampling is not determined in advance ( it is a random stopping time , indeed ) the set of trajectories of the dynamic system to be considered ( i.e. the parameter space ) has an infinite cardinality . on the other hand , sequential testing rules have been already extended to the case of composite hypotheses . in @xcite",
    "an sprt is adopted in a radar framework assuming a prior on the parameter space , in turn consisting of a finite number of elements ( the radar resolution cells )",
    ". sub - optimal sequential classification procedures ( also called multi - hypotheses tests ) were also proposed during the past years , such as @xcite for the case of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "observations and @xcite for the more general setting of non i.i.d . observations .",
    "however , all of these studies were restricted to a finite cardinality of the parameter space , an overly restrictive condition , which corresponds to requiring that the dynamic system may only lie in a determined state , with no transition allowed .",
    "few works in the past have studied sequential problems for hidden markov models ( hmms ) , which are known to admit a dynamical system representation in the sense of control theory @xcite . in @xcite the performances of sprts for model estimation in parametrized hmms and the cumulative sum ( cusum ) procedure for change point detection in hmms are studied , while @xcite addresses the quickest detection of transient signals represented as hmms using a cusum - like procedure , with possible applications to the radar framework .",
    "this paper addresses the problem of sequential detection and trajectory estimation of the state evolution of a dynamical system observed through noisy measurements . in the above framework ,",
    "its contributions can be summarized as follows .",
    "* at the design stage , a sequential procedure is defined with no restriction as to the parameter space cardinality .",
    "the detection part of the procedure realizes an sprt while , in order to estimate the system state trajectory , a gated estimator is defined , in the sense that estimation is enabled by the result of the detection operation .",
    "* it is known that wald s sprt for testing simple hypotheses based on i.i.d .",
    "observations has a number of remarkable properties @xcite , the most appealing being the fact that it simultaneously minimizes the expected sample size under both hypotheses . these properties , however , fail to hold when the observations are not i.i.d .",
    ", as it happens when they are generated by a dynamic system . in this paper ,",
    "a deep asymptotic analysis for the detection part is given and sufficient conditions under which these properties hold are stated , consistent with previous results in @xcite . in particular , it is shown that under a set of rather mild conditions the test ends with probability one and its stopping time is almost surely minimized in the class of tests with the same or smaller error probabilities . furthermore , reinforcing one of such conditions , it is also shown that any moment of the stopping time distribution is first - order asymptotically minimized in the same class of tests .",
    "* at the application stage , the general problem of multi - frame target detection and tracking for radar surveillance is considered : in this way , previous limitations on target mobility imposed by other studies are avoided . *",
    "finally , a thorough performance analysis is given , aimed primarily at showing the correctness of the asymptotic analysis and at investigating the effects of system parameters .",
    "the superiority of sequential detection and estimation rules with respect to fss techniques is also shown in the afore - mentioned radar application .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section presents the elements of the problem while section [ seq_rule_section ] addresses the sequential detection and estimation problem .",
    "section [ asym_an_section ] presents the asymptotic results while section [ radar_appl_sec ] covers the radar surveillance problem .",
    "finally , section [ num_res_sec ] is devoted to the presentation of numerical results , while concluding remarks are given in section [ conclusions ] .",

    "@xmath9 is the operator of expectation : a subscript will be added in case of ambiguity , so that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are expectation when @xmath12 is the true state of nature and hypothesis @xmath13 is true , respectively .",

    ", @xmath27 forms a discrete - time , homogeneous markov chain with given initial distribution @xmath28 and transition probabilities @xmath29 , @xmath30 . a sequence of states @xmath31 , often called trajectory ,",
    "is denoted with @xmath32 and has density @xmath33 , with respect to the counting measure .",
    "@xmath27 is observed through a set of noisy measurements .",
    "the measurement process is @xmath34 , and the sample space of each @xmath35 is @xmath36 , @xmath37 being a @xmath1-algebra of subsets of @xmath38 .",
    "consider a @xmath1-finite measure @xmath39 on @xmath36 .",
    "if the signal @xmath27 is present , @xmath40 is a hmm : given a realization @xmath41 of @xmath27 , @xmath34 is a sequence of conditionally independent random variables , each @xmath35 having density @xmath42 with respect to @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the measurements contain only noise , @xmath34 is an i.i.d .",

    "thus , for every @xmath44 , the joint distribution of @xmath45 has conditional density @xmath46 with respect to @xmath47 .    given these elements , one is to sample the process @xmath34 sequentially and decide , as soon as possible , if measurements are generated by noise alone or if they come from a dynamic system . in the latter case , it can be also required to estimate the system trajectory which has generated such measurements .",
    "the parameter space , then , is @xmath48 . as in @xcite ,",
    "whose focus , however , was on non - sequential decision rules , there is a mutual coupling of detection and estimation and two different strategies may be adopted .",
    "indeed , the structure of the decision rule can be chosen so as to improve the detection or the estimation performance .",
    "the former case is called a weakly coupled ( or uncoupled ) design while the latter a strongly coupled ( or coupled ) design . in both cases ,",
    "the estimator is enabled by the detection operation : this gating , however , can be ( possibly ) optimal for the detection or for the estimation . however , the problem of designing sequential procedures for detection and estimation is considerably more difficult than that of devising fss procedures @xcite and the approach taken in general is to extend and generalize the sprt designing a practical , possibly sub - optimal , rule @xcite . in this paper",
    "the uncoupled strategy is adopted , this choice being motivated by a number of reasons : it has a very simple structure ; as shown in section [ asym_an_section ] , it exhibits many optimal properties ; detection is the primary interest in many practical applications , as for example , radar surveillance problems later discussed .",
    "a sequential decision rule is the pair @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a stopping rule and @xmath51 a terminal decision rule @xcite .",
    "since detection and estimation are performed in parallel , the terminal decision rule is itself composed of a detection rule @xmath52 for testing the signal presence and of a trajectory estimator @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 . the proposed ( non - randomized ) sequential decision rule is , then ,    [ sprt_rule ] @xmath55    where @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the likelihood ratio of @xmath58 to @xmath59 .    notice that the pair @xmath60 is an sprt for testing @xmath61 ` noise only ' against the alternative @xmath62 ` signal present ' , no matter of its trajectory .",

    "this means that @xmath93 is the density of @xmath94 so that @xmath95 is a map estimator conditioned upon the event @xmath96 , @xmath97 being the projection of @xmath12 on @xmath98 . since the above estimation rule is exactly that in ( [ estimation_rule ] ) , it results that @xmath86 is a map estimation rule conditioned that no error of the first kind is made by the detector .    finally , as to the computational complexity , the sequential decision rule in ( [ sprt_rule ] ) requires to evaluate the statistics @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "these statistics , then , have the form of a stage - separated function on the algebraic system @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , and can be computed through two dynamic programming algorithms @xcite ( similar to the forward - backward procedure and to the viterbi algorithm as in @xcite ) , whereby the computational complexity is only linear in @xmath105 .",
    "notice that maximization in ( [ estimation_rule ] ) is preferred to @xmath106 since , in the former case , the estimator can work on the same data as the detector , thus further lowering the complexity .",
