    "in our previous analysis of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) elastic scattering data  @xcite , the upper energy limit was extended from 2.5 to 3.0  gev in the laboratory kinetic energy , t@xmath0 , in order to accomodate higher - energy proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) scattering measurements from saturne  ii at saclay and the edda collaboration at cosy .",
    "comparisons were made with the direct amplitude reconstruction ( dar ) and partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) study of ref .",

    "our energy - dependent and single - energy results were seen to follow different sets of dar amplitudes . with additional precise measurements",

    "such data have now appeared and our fits have changed substantially as a result .    in the following , we will list those data recently added to our database . after a brief reminder of the differences between the pwa and dar techniques , we will give our latest fit results .",
    "some of the changes have been quite large , and these are discussed in light of the constraints imposed by the earlier saclay dar results .",
    "finally , we summarize the status of the nn problem and consider what further work may be expected .",
    "the full database and a number of fits , from our group and others , are available through the on - line said facility  @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate only on those new measurements added since the sp00 ( spring 2000 ) solution was published .",

    "if a sufficient number of independent observables are measured ( precisely ) at a given energy and angle , these amplitudes can be determined up to an overall undetermined phase .",
    "the advantage of this method is its model independence ; nothing beyond the data is required to determine a solution . in addition , once the amplitudes are found , any further experimental quantity can be predicted at the energy - angle points of the dar .",
    "there are , however , a number of disadvantages .",
    "the process gives amplitudes only at single energy - angle points , and no result is possible if an insufficient number of observables is available .",
    "more standard is the pwa , which has observables constructed from a series of amplitudes or phase shifts with allowed combinations of spin , angular momentum and isospin .",
    "this series must be cut off or augmented with a model for the high angular momentum states .",
    "it should be noted that , given a set of partial - wave amplitudes , the amplitudes @xmath28 through @xmath29 can be constructed , whereas the existence of amplitudes @xmath28 through @xmath29 , at single energy - angle points , is insufficient to construct partial - wave amplitudes .    at low energies",
    ", the pwa technique can generate a solution that is stable and requires less than a complete set of measurements .",

    "are compared , in terms of fit @xmath30 , in table  [ tab : tbl4 ] . as in previous analyses ,",
    "we have used the systematic uncertainty as an overall normalization factor for angular distributions .",
    "the description of this procedure is given in our recent @xmath31n pwa paper  @xcite .",
    "below 1  gev , where the @xmath30/data is near unity , the pwa solution has changed little . however , above this energy , qualitative changes can be seen in some amplitudes - in particular , the @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the new fit ( sp07 ) has resolved some ambiguities found in comparing the previous sp00 energy - dependent and single - energy fits to dar results from saclay .",
    "however , the resulting partial - wave amplitudes , in particular @xmath32 and @xmath33 , have changed dramatically above 1  gev .",
    "given the impact of these data , and their absence above 2.5  gev , our solution should be considered at best qualitative between 2.5 and 3  gev .",
    "our agreement with the saclay dar amplitudes does not imply agreement is necessary at the pwa level .",
    "as we have noted , a pwa requires some model input , whereas the dar method requires only precise experimental data . as a test",

    "after fitting data , the original sp07 behavior was regained . a fit having the sp00 behavior for @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( a second @xmath30 minimum ) was not found .",
    "further progress on @xmath35 scattering will require a program to extend measurements above 1.3  gev .",
