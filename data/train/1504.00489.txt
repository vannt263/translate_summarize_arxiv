    "spectroscopy of internal pair conversion ( ipc ) has a long tradition @xcite . in a wide range of energies and atomic numbers ,",
    "the conversion coefficient for internal electron - positron pair formation are fairly high , typically in the order of @xmath6-@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the measurement of these coefficients offers an effective method for determining the multipolarity of electromagnetic transitions ( especially of high - energy and low - multipolarity transitions ) @xcite .    the determination of the multipolarity of the high - energy transitions produced after particle capture reactions might be especially important for nuclear astrophysics to gain deeper understanding of the dynamics of capture processes leading to a more accurate and reliable extraction of the astrophysical @xmath8 factor and the thermonuclear reactivity @xcite .    in many light nuclei ,",
    "the cross section for the radiative capture of protons , neutrons , deuterons and @xmath9 particles has been observed to consist of a background slowly varying with beam energy , upon which the various known resonances in the reaction are superposed .",
    "this smooth background , which is important for nuclear astrophysics , has been identified as an extra - nuclear channel phenomenon , since the process takes place far from the nucleus ( 40 - 50 fm ) rather than in the nuclear interior @xcite .",
    "this has been designated as direct capture ( single - step ) reaction .",
    "the direct capture process represents a transition for the projectile from an initial continuum state to a final state via interaction with the electromagnetic field .",
    "usually , it has a strong @xmath10 component but other multipolarities can also contribute .",
    "for the extraction and extrapolation of the astrophysical @xmath8 factor , it is important to know the multipole composition of such background radiations @xcite .",
    "the multidetector array is also designed to search for deviations from ipc due to the creation and subsequent decay into electron - positron pairs of a hypothetical short - lived neutral boson .",
    "recent results from both underground and cosmic ray experiments suggest that dark matter may be explained by a light boson having a mass of 10 mev - 10 gev and coupled to electrons and positrons .",
    "there have been several attempts to observe evidence for such particles , using data from running facilities @xcite or re - analyzing old experiments @xcite . since no evidence for their existence",
    "was found , limits on its coupling to ordinary matter were set as a function of its mass . in the near future , new experiments are expected to extend those limits in a region of couplings and/or masses so far unexplored .",
    "it is not widely known , but indications were found for the existence of such a light boson also in some nuclear physics experiments . while anomaly was observed in the internal pair production , the overall results were not consistent with the involvement of a neutral boson @xcite .",
    "a limit of @xmath1110@xmath12 was obtained for the boson to @xmath13-ray branching ratio @xcite .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) predicts @xcite that the angular correlation between the e@xmath3e@xmath14 pairs ( emitted in ipc ) peaks at 0@xmath15 and drops rapidly with the correlation angle ( @xmath16 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang - rose ] .",
    "calculated angular correlations of e@xmath3e@xmath14 pairs obtained from ipc for different multipolarities and a transition energy of e@xmath17=17 mev.,width=302 ]    the above calculations show that the angular correlations at small separation angles are almost independent of the multipolarity of the radiation , whereas at large separation angles , they depend critically upon the multipole order .",
    "thus , it is important to measure angular correlations efficiently at large angles .",
    "when a nuclear transition occurs by emission of a short - lived ( @xmath18 @xmath19 10@xmath20 s ) neutral particle , the annihilation into an e@xmath3e@xmath14 pair is anti - parallel ( i.e. @xmath21180@xmath15 ) in the center of mass system . in the laboratory system ,",
    "their angular distribution is peaked ( @xmath22 ) at intermediate angles due to the lorentz boost and provides an unique signature for the existence and a measure for the mass of an intermediate boson .",
    "in order to search for such an anomaly in the angular correlation , we need a spectrometer with sufficient angular resolution .    the invariant mass can be determined approximately from the relative angle @xmath16 between e@xmath3 and e@xmath14 and from their energies in the following way@xcite :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 mev is the transition energy and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 indicating the kinetic energy of the positron ( electron ) in the laboratory system .",
    "magnetic @xmath27 ray spectrometers were used first for internal pair formation studies @xcite .",
    "maximal detection efficiency of 10@xmath12 for electron - positron pair detection was achieved for a few cases @xcite .",
    "improvement of the pair resolution by improvement of the momentum resolution ( to 1.3% ) with smaller particle transmission reduced the efficiency to 5x10@xmath28 .",
    "an important advance @xcite in the use of intermediate - image pair spectrometer was provided by the installation of a specially designed spiral baffle system which selected electron - positron internal pairs emitted at large relative angles ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the next generation of internal - pair spectrometers used two @xmath30 scintillator - detector telescopes for the detection of the electron - positron pairs in quadruple coincidence @xcite .",
    "a multi - detector ( six scintillation electron telescopes plus an annular si(li ) particle detector ) high - efficiency pair spectrometer was built by birk and co - workers @xcite .",
    "an experimental pair - line efficiency of 28% and a sum - peak energy resolution of 12% for the 6.05 mev e0 pair line in @xmath0o were achieved .",

    "the pair - line efficiency of the spectrometer @xcite was large , but it had a very limited discrimination power for different multipolarities in this energy region .",
    "the debrecen superconducting solenoid transporter plus two - si(li)-detector electron spectrometer was also adapted for internal - pair studies @xcite . the observed pair - line efficiency for two detectors operated in sum - coincidence mode was 35% , while the energy resolution was 0.6% at 2 mev .",

    "isotropic emission of pairs would also result in a sine distribution for the relative angles @xmath44 ,",
    "the so - called correlation angle .    also boson decays can be generated as well as gamma ray coincidences .",
    "the electrons and positrons are followed through the setup and the detected energy losses are stored , including detection of annihilation radiation from the stopped positrons .",
    "the energy loss steps are small until a final energy of 90 kev .",
    "the simulated events are stored in a similar way as the measurements , but now as precise deposited energies and positions inside the wire chambers and including the generated electron and positron energies and correlation angles .",
    "plastic scintillator detectors combine reasonable energy resolution with minimum response to @xmath13 radiation and with excellent characteristics for fast , sub - nanosecond coincidence timing , which is crucial for good background reduction .",

    "the target , positioned perpendicular to the beam , is mounted on a target holder supported from the back by two perspex rods of 3 mm diameter .",
    "the original 0.5 mm thick al target holders with 10 mm inner diameter opening were replaced when data showed shadowing due to scattering in the aluminum sides.the geant simulations confirmed this shadowing and also some background via external pair production . to avoid this , the targets were evaporated onto 10-micron thick , 50-mm long and 5 mm wide al strips , which was stretched between two 3-mm thick plexiglas rods .",
    "the rods are arranged parallel to the beam and their distance from the beam was 25 mm .",
    "on the basis of simulations , they did not cause significant background via external electron - positron conversion .",
    "the bars were 12-cm long , and the placement was done so as not to cause any shadowing effects in any of the telescopes .",
    "the targets have a typical thickness of 0.3 mg/@xmath56 , which is adapted to the resonance width of the reaction under investigation as well as to the demand of a sufficient real - to - random ratio of coincidences .",
    "the beam is absorbed in a tantalum faraday - cup 15 cm behind the target .",
    "the signals from the photomultipliers of the @xmath45e - e detectors are processed in constant fraction discriminator units ( cf8000 ) .",
    "the cfd thresholds are adjusted slightly above the noise level of the @xmath45e detectors ( which are essentially insensitive to @xmath13 ray events ) and a bit higher for the @xmath49 detectors .",
    "chance events from double ( or multiple ) hits by @xmath13 rays in the @xmath49 detectors are suppressed by requiring a @xmath45e - e coincidence .",

    "time and energy signals of the @xmath45e - e detectors as well as the time signals ( up , down , left , right ) of the mwpc detector are recorded .",
    "the spectra of single telescope events are used for on - line monitoring of the efficiencies and an approximate energy calibration of the @xmath49 detectors . especially for the @xmath45e detectors with their low cfd thresholds",
    "this on - line survey is important . in the off - line analysis",
    "these spectra provide a reliable way to determine the telescope efficiencies .",
    "the energy calibration of the telescopes for low energies was made with the compton edges of a @xmath57co source , while at high energies we used the compton edges of high energy @xmath13 transitions coming from proton capture reactions .",
    "the high energy edges of the singles electron spectra offered also good calibration points , which was used for on - line gain monitoring and corrections as well .",
    "it was possible to correct the gain shifts with a precision of about 1% , well below the energy resolution of the detectors .",
    "finally , the sum energy spectra was checked for the 6.05-mev transition in @xmath0o excited in the @xmath58f(p,@xmath9)@xmath0o reaction , the 4.44-mev and 15.1-mev transitions in @xmath1c excited in the @xmath59b(p,@xmath13)@xmath1c reaction and the 17.6 mev line in @xmath2be excited in the @xmath60li(p,@xmath13)@xmath5be reaction .",
    "the energy threshold settings of the @xmath45e detectors were found to be also very important .",
    "we had to make sure that we are not cutting too much from the low - energy part of the energy - loss distributions .",
    "the energy calibration of those detectors was based on the comparison of the measured and simulated energy loss distributions of the strong 6.05 mev @xmath32 transition in @xmath0o .",

    "we were aiming at a precision of about 1% for the shape of the response function .",
    "the detectors measure continuous e@xmath3e@xmath14 spectra and the sum of the energies are constructed off - line . due to the energy loss in the wall of the chamber and in the @xmath45e detectors , as well as the finite thresholds of the discriminators ( cfd ) ,",
    "the low - energy part of the spectrum is always cut out .",
    "thresholds should be set equally to have similar efficiencies for the different telescopes . after a proper energy calibration of the telescopes ,",
    "it was done by software cuts .",
    "the response of the mwpc detectors depends slightly on the position of the hit , the energy of the particle and might slowly change also in time .",
    "the response curve depends primarily on the geometrical arrangement of the detector telescopes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : telescope6 m ] , initially we used six equivalent telescopes placed symmetrically around the target .",
    "however , due to the six - fold rotational symmetry of the spectrometer and the finite solid angle of the detectors , the response varied drastically as a function of the correlation angle . moreover , at the minima of the curve , the edge effects of the detectors dominated , which made the response values under - defined .",
    "thus , it was advantageous to break the rotational symmetry to make the response curve smoother .",
    "since we also had to increase the response around 90 degrees , we set the geometry of the setup as shown in fig .",

    "this gives rise to an angular spread of the reconstructed angular correlation .",
    "the simulated angular resolution corresponds to fwhm @xmath62 degrees .",
    "we use bins of 10 degrees in the correlation spectra .",
    "the shape of the coincidence response curve depends also on position of the beam spot , which may walk during a long experiment .",

    "we measure low coincidence rates , especially at large separation angles , so the effect of traversing cosmic rays has to be considered .",
    "background measurements have been performed before and after the experiments with the settings ( gates , thresholds , etc . ) of the in - beam measurement , and the angular correlation of the background events were subtracted with a weighting factor .",
