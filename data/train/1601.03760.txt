    "it was pointed out first by voigt in 1902  @xcite that the two optical axes , i.e. crystal directions in which the index of refraction does not depend on polarization , of biaxial crystals split into four _ windungsachsen _ , now mostly termed singular optical axes , in the absorption regime when the elements of the dielectric tensor are complex .",
    "three crystal systems are optically biaxial , namely , in increasing order of symmetry , the triclinic , monoclinic and orthorhombic systems . in  @xcite",

    "we note here that it is trivial and well known that for uniaxial crystals , e.g. @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eps_o ] ) , there is a single optical axis regardless whether @xmath19 is real or complex .",
    "the discussion of the energy dependence of the direction of the singular optical axes for real biaxial materials has not been reported in the literature since spectrally resolved data for the dielectric tensor of such materials are rarely reported . here",
    ", we first give a general discussion of the singular optical axes and the degeneration of their indices of refraction for the triclinic , monoclinic and orthorhombic systems .",
    "we also develop an analytical formula for the angular azimuthal position of the singular axes in monoclinic crystals .",
    "it can be simplified for @xmath20 and provides a complete explicit analytical solution for the orthorhombic case",
    ". then we use the recently published complete dielectric tensor for monoclinic @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 ( available in a wide transparency regime 0.54.7ev and within the absorption regime from about 4.7ev up to 8.5ev )  @xcite .",

    "only one of the two circularly polarized waves can propagate , thus voigt called these optical axes _ windungsachsen _  @xcite .",
