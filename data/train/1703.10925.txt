    "in particle physics , there has been a deep question known as the gauge hierarchy problem : `` how do the sm fermions appear at such a small electroweak scale , compared to an ultra - violet completed scale , the planck mass @xmath5  or the grand unification ( gut ) scale @xmath6 ? ''",
    "two issues in the hierarchy problem are : ( i ) obtaining massless sm particles at the ultra - violet completed scale , and ( ii ) rendering the elctroweak scale masses to the sm fermions .",
    "the first issue is resolved by the profound and simple requirement , a chiral theory at the ultra - violet completed scale @xcite .",
    "the second issue is the method obtaining the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field at the electroweak scale @xmath7@xmath8 , a kind of tev scale , for which the most well - known example is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose that any particles appearing at the tev scale , for a detection possibility at the lhc , must satisfy condition ( i ) .",
    "the best known example is a spinor representation in the so(@xmath9 ) gut models @xcite .",
    "orbifolding in extra dimensions presents a possibility of massless particles , as shown in a simple field theoretic orbifold @xcite .",
    "but , the orbifold compactification in string theory is the prototype example @xcite .",
    "anyway , condition ( i ) is the basic requirement we satisfy at low energy effective theory in 4 dimensions ( 4d ) . to realize condition ( ii ) ,",
    "model parameters are required to be known in detail , and hence we do not discuss it here except pointing out several mass scales in particle physics .",
    "the sm a chiral theory , realized in nature , describes the electroweak scale physics successfully .",
    "so , we anticipate that if a natural chiral model is found then it might have a great chance to be realized in nature .",
    "since any new particle has not been detected at the lhc so far , a new particle in the new chiral theory , which interacts with the sm sector extremely feebly , must be in the dark sector . here",
    ", the dark sector is not introduced just for explaining cold dark matter ( cdm ) of the universe .",
    "the well - known cdm examples , `` invisible '' axions @xcite and weaky interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite , are belonging to the visible sector . on the other hand , the heterotic @xmath10 string @xcite implies a possibility of dark sector from e@xmath3 . if the dark sector introduces cdm , then it is just a bonus .",
    "even though the dark sector interacts with the sm sector extremely feebly , it can be probed by the kinetic mixing terms @xcite of two sm gauge bosons , photon and @xmath11 .",
    "since the dark sector does not carry the sm weak hyperchage , the charge raising and lowering gauge bosons in the dark sector can not have kinetic mixings with @xmath12 of the sm .",
    "we will show that the simplest chiral theory which does not have any gravitational and gauge anomalies is . because the rank of this gauge group is 2",
    ", we will have two @xmath13 gauge bosons at low energy .",
    "this minimal model will be called two dark @xmath11 model ( tdz ) .",
    "the first new particles observed at the cern sps proton - antiproton collider were @xmath12 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this is because it is relatively easy to identify leptons at high energy colliders . with this new chiral model , therefore , we expect that the first new particles expected at the lhc are two dark @xmath11 s .    in sec .",

    "if a new gauge boson pops up near the electroweak scale , it must be from a chiral theory . a chiral theory near the electroweak scale should not have gravititonal and gauge anomalies .",
    "first , consider the rank-1 gauge groups . if we consider an su(2 ) , it is not possible to have a chiral theory because there must be even number of doublets @xcite . with only one u(1)@xmath15 group ,",
    "the absence of gravitational anomaly requires tr@xmath16 and the absence of gauge anomaly in addition requires tr@xmath17 . for example , even though two charged fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not have these anomalies , the model is not allowed in our framework because it is vector - like .",

    "there are four doublets without the su(2 ) anomaly @xcite .",

    "this estimate will be used in appendix .",
    "if multiple dark - u(1 ) gauge bosons are present , they can mix with the sm photon , most probably via kinetic mixings as suggested in @xcite . since the rank of gauge group is 2 ,",
    "there are two dark - z@xmath4 s and we summarize their kinetic mixing with photon .- boson is omitted here . ]",
    "these arise via loops between photon and dark - photon through an intermediate particle(s ) @xmath44 which carries both the electromagnetic and dark charges . after a proper diagonalization procedure of the kinetic energy terms , then the electromagnetic charge of @xmath44 can be millicharged , @xmath45 . in the heterotic @xmath10 string model , the extra e@xmath3 gauge group may contain dark - photons which will be called dark - z@xmath4 s , leading to the kinetic mixing of @xmath46@xcite .",
