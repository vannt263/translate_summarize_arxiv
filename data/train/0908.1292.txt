    "the orbital element determination of extrasolar planets from radial velocity measurements is relatively complex . as mentioned in beaug ( 2008 ) ,",
    "the equations relating observations to orbital elements ( and minimal planetary masses ) are highly non - linear and generate different local minima in the parameter space , and consequently , different possible observational fits .",
    "moreover , in order to correctly determine orbital elements , the ratio between the @xmath2 number of observations and the @xmath3 number of free parameters must be relatively high .",
    "but generally , the duration of observations is only of the order of @xmath4 or @xmath5 times the orbital period of the outer planet of a system .",
    "owing to the necessity of observing systems over a large number of times the outer planet period ( in order to determine orbital elements with a convenient precision ) , the assurance of a correct determination of orbital elements is not necessarily guaranteed .",
    "the real dynamics of multi - planetary systems found until now is consequently difficult to point out . at this time",
    ", the orbital elements of only one multi - planetary system prove to be acquired  : the very compact gliese 876 system . known since 1998 ( marcy 1998 , delfosse 1998 , marcy 2001 , rivera 2005 ) , a large series of observations has allowed to gather a sufficient number of radial velocity measurements to determine with a good precision the orbital elements of the gliese 876 main planets .",
    "such a determination has continually been improved since 1998 .",
    "while the two major planets are revolving around their host star in about @xmath6 days and @xmath7 days , observations have been performed for @xmath8 years .",
    "the @xmath9 ratio between the number of observations ( @xmath2 ) and the orbital period ( @xmath10 ) of planets is then particularly high and permits a good precision of the gliese 876 system fit .",
    "unfortunately , the whole of other detected multi - planetary systems does not present such a high @xmath9 ratio .",
    "the orbital determination of all the other systems is not still completely acquired . in the present paper",
    ", we propose to carry out new observational fits for specific configurations of several compact multi - planetary systems .",
    "for eight compact planetary systems ( hd37124 , hd69830 , hd73526 , hd108874 , hd128311 , hd155358 , hd160691 , and hd202206 ) , we indeed assume that one planet of each system moves in retrograde direction on its orbit , while other planets have a prograde motion around the host star .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we particularly focus on systems harboring planets with large masses and close to their host star . as a consequence , the keplerian approximation is no longer suitable .",
    "it is necessary to perform dynamical fits instead .",
    "we use a genetic algorithm ( pikaia , see charbonneau 1995 ) with a set of initial conditions randomly taken in the orbital parameter space .",
    "we refer to beaug ( 2007 ) for a complete description of the radial velocity method and the use of the pikaia code . owing to the current theories of planetary formation ( in a disk of gas and dust ) and to a large number of parameters to fit in the case of orbital motions in a 3-dimensional space , dynamical fits",
    "are generally performed while considering coplanar ( and prograde ) configurations .",
    "hence , the code we use was firstly developed for such prograde and coplanar orbits . as a consequence",
    ", we have modified the pikaia code in such a way that observational fits can be performed for planetary systems harboring one planet ( whatever its location within the system ) in retrograde motion on its orbit ( contrary to other planets of the same system ) .",
    "we have carried out dynamical fits for eight systems in counter - revolving configurations ( hd37124 , hd69830 , hd73526 , hd108874 , hd128311 , hd155358 , hd160691 , and hd202206 ) . in each case , we have selected the best fits leading to dynamically stable solutions . while for most systems a fit involving two planets is sufficient to obtain a rather good fit ( i.e. @xmath1 close to @xmath11 ) , the assumption of three planets for the dynamical fits of the hd37124 and hd69830 systems is necessary .",
    "the orbital elements found for the best fit of each system are presented in table [ tab_obs ] whereas the new values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are compared , in table [ tab_reduc ] , to previous fits coming from prograde configurations ( see vogt 2005 , lovis 2006 , tinney 2006 , butler 2006 , cochran 2007 , sndor 2007 , and udry 2002 ) .",
    "some systems are henceforth found close to retrograde mean motion resonances ( noted r - mmr hereafter )  : hd73526 and hd128311 ( 2:1 r - mmr ) , hd108874 and hd160691 ( 4:1 r - mmr ) , hd202206 ( 5:1 r - mmr ) , hd155358 ( 8:3 r - mmr ) .",
    "the new radial velocities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] according to the new dynamical fits of each studied planetary system .    in most cases ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 values obtained for counter - revolving configurations are of the same order , and sometimes slightly better , than for prograde configurations ( see table [ tab_reduc ] ) . because the fit of the hd160691 planetary system proves to be very bad ( @xmath12 ) while considering two planets in counter - revolving configuration ,",
    "we have tried to obtain a better result by performing a new fit with three planets , one of them revolving in retrograde motion ( not show here ) . however",
    ", we also find a high value of @xmath1 .",
    "the prograde fit for this system proves to be definitely better . in the end , for the other systems ( except for the hd37124 system ) , the counter - revolving configurations are consistent with the current observational data .",
    "the dynamical fits presented in the present paper tend to show that , over the eight studied multi - planetary systems , six of them are liable to be regulated by a mechanism involving a counter - revolving configuration with a retrograde mmr . except for the hd37214 and hd160691 systems for which the retrograde fits are indeniably bad , the whole of other fits are slightly better than fits in prograde configurations .",
    "nevertheless , it remains necessary to perform new series of observations in order to enlarge the observational data samples and , as a consequence , to obtain more precise results .",
    "although counter - revolving configurations seem possible both from an observational point of view ( i.e. with observational consistence ) and from a theoretical one , the formation of such systems does not seem obvious .",
    "indeed , the assumption that two giant planets are in a mmr and revolving in opposite directions around their hosting star is apparently contradicting to the most accepted formation theory of planetary systems , notably to the formation and evolution of the resonant planetary systems ( core accretion mechanism combined by a planetary migration scenario ) .",
    "however , as mentionned in gayon & bois ( 2008 ) , two feasible processes leading to planets revolving in opposite directions have been found .",
    "the first scenario has been introduced by nagasawa ( 2008 ) . starting from a hierarchical 3-planet system and considering a migration mechanism including a process of planet - planet scattering as well as a tidal circularization ,",
    "the authors show that close - in planets may be formed . in a few cases , due to the kozai mechanism",
    ", one planet may enter a retrograde motion . on the other hand , with varvoglis , we have imagined a second feasible process that is related to the capture of free - floating planets ( private discussions ) . by integrating the trajectories of planet - sized bodies that encounter a coplanar two - body system ( a sun - like star and a jupiter mass )",
    ", varvoglis has found that the probability of capture is significant .",
    "morever , the percentage of free - floating planets forever captured is higher for retrograde motions than for prograde motions . as a consequence",
    ", it seems possible to find one day some planetary systems stabilized in counter - revolving configurations .",
    "computations have been done on the `` msocentre sigamm '' machine , hosted by observatoire de la cte dazur .",
