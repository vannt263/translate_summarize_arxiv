    "3c89 is a classical wide angle tail radio galaxy .",
    "its radio luminosity at 408 mhz , @xmath8 , is of the order of 4@xmath910@xmath10 w / hz , among the highest for fr - i radio galaxies@xcite . its 1.4 ghz luminosity , 1.6 @xmath9 10@xmath10 w hz@xmath11 , is comparable to that of many fr - ii radio galaxies .",
    "however , only weak emission lines are visible in its optical spectrum , that appears as that of a normal elliptical galaxy @xcite .",
    "this was also confirmed by follow - up spectroscopic observation that allowed us to determine the value of the log [ o iii]/h@xmath12 = 0.03 , placing 3c89 in the area of the optical spectroscopic diagrams populated by normal 3cr radio galaxies and well separated from the extremely low - excitation galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , we can conclude that 3c89 is more similar to a normal fr - i radio galaxy than an fr - ii .",
    "the x - ray core is detected at 2.4@xmath13 level in the 2 - 8 kev energy range .",
    "assuming the typical photon index of 1.7 , the 2 - 10 kev luminosity of the x - ray core is of the order of 6 @xmath9 10@xmath14 erg sec@xmath11 .",
    "the vla archival data available trough the nrao vla archive survey ( nvas ) database were examined .",
    "the 3c89 compact radio core is clearly detected in both 1.5 ghz and 8.4 ghz radio images , but no signatures of radio jet knots are visible close to the nuclear region .",
    "the curved extended structure ( hereafter indicated as plumes or lobes ) could be attributed to the impact of the high density icm that confines the radio emitting material arising from the radio jets .",
    "two bright knots are visible in the 1.5 ghz radio image ( e.g. , fig .",
    "2 ) lying at distances of @xmath0 50 kpc ( se direction ) and at 40 kpc ( w direction ) from the core , but the presence of extended radio emission trailing them to the south ( i.e. plumes ) distinguishes them from typical fr - ii hotspots .",
    "radio agn can have a significant impact on the surroundings through jets .",
    "bending of radio jets can be used to constrain some properties of the jets , e.g. , the total kinetic power and the particle density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from time - independent euler s equation",
    ", we have :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the relativistic enthalpy , @xmath17 is minimum synchrotron pressure , @xmath18 is the particle density in the jet , @xmath19 is the velocity of the jet flow , @xmath20 is the icm ram pressure , @xmath21 is the radius of the jet and @xmath22 is the radius of curvature of the bent jet . for a non - relativistic jet , @xmath17 is small and we do not include in our calculations .",
    "thus , the total kinetic power of the jet @xmath23 @xmath24 . the ram pressure can be estimated by , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the icm gas density and velocity respectively . using above relations , and adopting @xmath28 = 1.5 @xmath9 10@xmath29 cm@xmath29 , @xmath27 = 1.6 @xmath9 10@xmath31 km sec@xmath11 , @xmath21 = 3 kpc , @xmath22 = 50 kpc ( obtained from radio image ) and @xmath32 = @xmath33 @xmath34",
    ", we find @xmath20 = 7.3 @xmath9 10@xmath35 dyne @xmath36 and the total kinetic power @xmath23 = 1.5 @xmath9 10@xmath37 erg sec@xmath11 .",
    "often , the jet velocity is measured at the flaring point which is close to the nucleus .",
    "the average beaming speed for wats was estimated to be ( 0.3 @xmath38 0.1 ) @xmath34 by @xcite under the assumption that the jets are intrinsically symmetrical and that the jet sidedness ratio is due to relativistic beaming effects .",
    "however , there is no direct evidence of relativistic speeds in such jets .",
    "additionally , wat jets disrupt at larger distance ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) which may reduce the jet speed .",
    "for a jet speed between 0.01 @xmath34 - 0.3 @xmath34 , we estimate the total kinetic power of the jet @xmath39 = ( 0.05 - 1.5 ) @xmath9 10@xmath37 erg sec@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite established an empirical relation between cavity power and the total radio power from a sample of 24 radio galaxies , although the scatter is quite substantial .",
    "for 3c89 s radio luminosity , the cavity power would be @xmath0 6.0 @xmath9 10@xmath40 erg sec@xmath11 from the relations by @xcite , consistent with the estimate from jet bending .",
    "the ee is located @xmath0 250 kpc east of the cluster center .",
    "this looks like a localized feature .",
    "a projected azimuthally averaged radial profile of the cluster ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows a rise in surface brightness at the region between 250 to 700 kpc from the cluster center .",
    "this implies the presence of dense gas in the region .",
    "we compare surface brightness distribution from the e region shown in fig .",
    "4 ( the upper left panel ) with and without the ee . the projected surface brightness profile of the region is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( the lower left panel ) .",
    "the data points in black ( stars ) and red ( diamonds ) show the surface brightness distribution with and without the ee respectively .",
    "the figure shows the brightness drops by a factor of 2 when this x - ray bright region is excluded .",
    "the profiles are consistent with each other beyond @xmath0 1000 kpc , so the ee has an extent of @xmath0 450 kpc .",
    "the density enhancement of the ee was estimated by deprojecting surface brightness profiles assuming a spherical geometry .",
    "we estimate the drop in the density by a factor of @xmath0 1.5 from an average density of 4.5 @xmath9 10@xmath41 cm@xmath29 when ee was excluded .",
    "the spectral analysis ( table 4 ) shows that the ee ( region 6 ) is hotter than its surroundings ( region 6a ) . since the ee is also denser than its surroundings , it is overpressurized .",
    "its rest - frame 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity is 7.7 @xmath9 10@xmath42 ergs sec@xmath11 .",
    "the ee hosts bcg 3 ( fig .",
    "this suggests that the ee is associated with another infalling subcluster .",
    "this third merging subcluster could explain the overpressurized gas in the region .",
    "however , we did not detect any upstream shock in current data .",
    "deeper observations with a wider field of view would help to resolve the nature of the ee .",
    "the _ chandra _ image ( fig",
    ". 1 and 2 ) shows a faint `` tail '' southwest of the cluster center , behind 3c89 s tail . the count image with a 2d elliptical beta model subtracted ( fig .",
    "2d ) shows an excess in the position of the faint tail . as a faint feature , it is difficult to determine its full extent using the current data .",
    "the tail is clearly visible over a distance of @xmath0 500 kpc from 3c89 and is @xmath0 30 kpc wide .",
    "however , the unsharp masked image suggests that it may extend up to a distance of @xmath0 1 mpc from 3c89 .",
    "we also plot the surface brightness distribution across this feature ( fig .",
    "its spectral properties ( region 7 in fig .",
    "5 ) were also studied .",
    "the regions on either side of the tail was used for local background .",
    "the best - fit temperature was found to be 5.0@xmath43 kev , for a fixed abundance of 0.3 z@xmath7 .",
    "the gas surrounding the tail has a temperature of 4.0@xmath44 kev .",
    "the deprojection of the surface brightness suggests a density rise in the tail by a factor of @xmath0 2 compared to the average surrounding gas density of 5.1 @xmath9 10@xmath41 cm@xmath29 . here",
    ", the line of sight extent of the tail was taken to be equal to its narrow width on the plane of the sky .",
    "thus , the tail is likely to be an overpressurized feature .",
    "its rest - frame 0.5 - 2.0 kev luminosity is ( 8.1 @xmath38 2.0 ) @xmath9 10@xmath14 ergs sec@xmath11 .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the data is that rxj0334.2 - 0111 is experiencing a two - body merger near the plane of sky .",
    "the system exhibits a complicated merger morphology with substructure seen on the both sides of the merger axis .",
    "the x - ray morphology is elongated in the sw - ne direction with two density discontinuities .",
    "the inner discontinuity is a cold front surrounded by the hot gas of the main cluster .",
    "since the infalling cool core is moving faster than the local sound speed , a bow shock is seen @xmath0 50 kpc upstream .",
    "the cold front in this cluster has a distinctly narrow shape with the radius of curvature of @xmath0 10 kpc .",
    "the radius of curvature of the shock front is @xmath0 20 times greater than that of the cold front , the highest ratio known among merging clusters . in case of the bullet cluster ,",
    "this ratio is @xmath0 4 while in abell 2744 it is about 8 .",
    "such a small cold front has been observed in other mergers such as the southern subcluster in abell 85 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ngc 4839 subcluster in coma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no shocks have been reported there . compared with the these two cases with similar x - ray morphology , the merger of the 3c89 subcluster is in a later stage .",
    "it is possible that at the end of mergers in these systems , only the high density core of the original cool core will survive , with properties similar to embedded coronae found in many clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the most exciting feature of the merger is the shock ( @xmath45 1.6 from the temperature jump vs. @xmath0 1.9 from the density jump ) .",
    "this implies a shock velocity of @xmath0 1.6 @xmath9 10@xmath31 km sec@xmath11 .",
    "the sharpness of this edge indicates that the shock motion is almost perpendicular to the line of sight . assuming that the infalling cluster is moving close to the shock velocity ( although it can be lower , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimate the core passage occurred just 50 myr ago .",
    "this is 5 - 6 times shorter than the time scales estimated for the bullet cluster and abell 2146 @xcite .",
    "the cooling time for the icm gas at the center of many galaxy clusters is less than 10@xmath46 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the cool gas should trigger an inward flow of material known as `` cooling flow '' @xcite .",
    "in contrast , observations found much less cold gas than expected ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , suggesting a source of heat at the center of galaxy clusters .",
    "the widely accepted candidate is the energy injected by radio agn .",
    "the  data confirmed the idea by showing x - ray plasma being displaced by radio sources located at the center of the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , x - ray observations are critical for measuring the non - radiative output from the agn jets .",
    "7 shows the  image of the cluster with 1.5 ghz  radio contours overlaid .",
    "interestingly , the radio contours to the west are bent upwards near the decrement .",
    "the decrement is detected at 4.5@xmath13 level in 0.7 - 2.0 kev energy range in the west . in the east",
    ", the radio jet is cutting through the main cluster core .",
    "however , the putative cavity is probably projected with the core of the main cluster , so the projected significance of the cavity is reduced .",
    "this suggests that the radio jets are working against the surrounding x - ray plasma to form a cavity .",
    "the total energy required to form a cavity is equal to its enthalpy , given by    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the pressure of the icm gas surrounding the cavity , @xmath49 is the cavity volume , and @xmath50 is the adiabatic index for the gas inside the cavity . for a relativistic gas ,",
    "@xmath50 = 4/3 , and the total energy @xmath51 = 4@xmath52 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume the shape of the cavity is a cylinder of radius 30 kpc and length 100 kpc and determine , @xmath51 = 1.26 @xmath9 10@xmath53 ergs .",
    "we assume that the bubble moves outwards from the agn at the local sound speed and estimate the cavity s age , 9.7 @xmath9 10@xmath54 years . the mean power required to create",
    "the cavity is , @xmath55 = 4.1 @xmath9 10@xmath56 ergs sec@xmath11 .",
    "a similar amount of power is expected at the other side of the radio agn .",
    "the total cavity power estimated from the possible x - ray cavity is close to the jet power estimated from jet bending in section 5 , especially if the jet speed is nonrelativistic .",
    "on the other hand , the possible x - ray cavity is small and may not contain the radio lobes , which will make our estimate of cavity power too low .",
    "the cluster contains three luminous galaxies whose 2mass @xmath57 band luminosities are comparable to that of a typical bcg .",
    "the location of two galaxies ( bcg 1 & 2 in fig . 1 ) are consistent with a merger scenario between two subclusters , where bcg 2 is the bcg of the infalling subcluster and bcg 1 is considered the cd galaxy of the main cluster .",
    "however , this merger scenario does not readily explain the ee , where bcg 3 is located . during the merger , gas stripped from the outskirts of the infalling subcluster",
    "may be left along an arcing trajectory , to form the tail - like feature .",
    "a cartoon shows the merger features in rxj0334.2 - 01111 in fig .",
    "a bow shock is formed when the infalling gas body moves faster than the local speed of sound . in some cases",
    ", a shock is also observed in the reverse direction e.g. , abell 2146 @xcite and abell 2219 @xcite .",
    "the shocks in abell 2146 have mach number @xmath0 2.3 ( downstream ) and @xmath0 1.6 ( upstream ) . in abell 2219",
    ", merger has formed multiple edges which are consistent with the mach number ranging from 1.1 - 1.2 .",
    "the bow shock in rxj0334.2 - 0111 is quite comparable to shocks found in other merging galaxy clusters .",
    "however , we do not observe any shock front in the reverse direction .",
    "the distance between the stagnation point and the closest point on the bow shock ( the shock `` stand - off '' distance @xmath58 ) can be estimated using the approximate method described by @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the shape of the cold front can be approximated by a cylinder with radius @xmath0 5 kpc .",
    "moeckel s method predicts a bow shock at the distance of 40 - 80 kpc from the cold front for mach number @xmath1 = 1.6 - 2.0 .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed distance of @xmath0 50 kpc . on the other hand , for a rigid sphere , the ratio of the shock stand - ff distance , @xmath58 , to the radius of curvature of the cold front @xmath59 depends on the mach number @xmath1 .",
    "fig . 9 ( dashed line ) shows the value of @xmath60 as function of @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the data points show observed ratios , @xmath60 , for known shocks located ahead of a cold front ( bullet cluster @xcite , abell 754 @xcite , abell 520 @xcite , abell 2146 @xcite , abell 2744 @xcite , rxj0751.3 + 5012 @xcite .",
    "we find that most of the clusters ( except for abell 754 ) do nt agree with the model .",
    "a possible explanation is that the infalling cool core constantly being stripped is not a rigid body .",
    "stripping continuously reduces the core radius and increases @xmath58 at the same time .",
    "we find that the @xmath60 ratios can be reduced to agree with the model , if the core radius is increased by a factor of 2 - 3 and @xmath58 is decreased accordingly .",
    "many merging clusters hosting a robust bow shock exhibit diffuse radio emission e.g. , abell 520 , abell 754 , abell 2744 and the bullet cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the connection between merger substructures and diffuse radio emission has long been discussed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interestingly , the diffuse radio sources are only found in clusters that show complex signs of mergers .",
    "for example , abell 754 hosts a bow shock of similar strength ( m @xmath0 1.6 ) as rxj0334.2 - 0111 and also exhibits diffuse radio emission in the outskirts @xcite .",
    "this shock front coincides with the edge of non - thermal radio emission at 325 mhz @xcite .",

    "the lack of extended radio emission in rxj0334.2 - 0111 could be due to several factors .",
    "any detection of low surface - brightness radio features is hindered by the strong radio source 3c89 ( @xmath0 3 jy at 1.4 ghz ) and would require data with a high dynamic range .",
    "detection of the diffuse radio emission is also easier at low radio frequencies than at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the other possibility is the relatively low mass of the cluster . in a study on the _ gmrt _ radio halo cluster sample ,",
    "@xcite identified the majority of clusters without a radio halo as having low x - ray luminosities and therefore low masses that are similar to rxj0334.2 - 0111 s .",
    "the new 66 ksec _ chandra _ observation of rxj0334.2 - 0111 revealed a merger between at least two subclusters . the image ( fig .",

    "\\1 ) the bright inner surface brightness edge is a cold front .",
    "it is formed when the cool , dense core of the infalling subcluster passes through the hot ambient medium .",
    "a tail of ram pressure stripped gas can be seen following the cold front over a distance of @xmath0 70 kpc .",
    "the observed stagnation pressure ratio is consistent with an infalling velocity of @xmath0 1.5 @xmath9 10@xmath31 km sec@xmath11 .",
    "the cool core remnant of the main cluster can be seen se of the cold front .",
    "\\2 ) an additional surface brightness edge @xmath0 50 kpc ahead of the cold front has been observed .",
    "this is a bow shock with a mach number of 1.6@xmath2 and is visible over @xmath0 500 kpc in length .",
    "the shock velocity of 1.6@xmath62 @xmath9 10@xmath31 km sec@xmath11 is consistent with the infalling cloud velocity . from the projected distance between two clusters of @xmath0 90 kpc",
    ", we find the closest approach occurred @xmath0 50 myr ago .",
    "\\3 ) the ee is an x - ray bright region located @xmath0 250 kpc east of the cluster center .",
    "the region contains overpressurized gas at relatively high temperature ( @xmath0 5.5 kev ) and higher density than the surroundings . a massive galaxy ( bcg 3 in fig .",
    "1 ) is likely the dominant galaxy of a third infall subcluster that is responsible for the ee .",
    "\\4 ) a long , faint `` tail '' is observed to the west of 3c89 , but the connection with 3c89 s bright x - ray tail is not clear .",
    "it is clearly visible over a distance of @xmath0 500 kpc and may extend up to @xmath0 1 mpc .",
    "the spectral analysis of this region suggests it is also an overpressurized region .",
    "this feature is faint in the current data so deeper observations are required to better understand it .",
    "\\5 ) the radio lobes of the strong wat source 3c89 are likely interacting with the x - ray gas , revealed by the x - ray decrement in the positions of radio lobes .",
    "we estimate the mechanical power required to create the decrement - like cavity to be @xmath0 10@xmath40 ergs sec@xmath11 , close to the the total jet power estimated from jet bending .",
    "\\6 ) from the comparison between the ratio of the stand - off distance ( @xmath63 ) to the radius of curvature of the cold front ( @xmath59 ) and the shock mach number , it is found that most merger shocks in the clusters ( apart from abell 754 ) do not agree with the model results for a rigid sphere .",
    "we suggest that stripping continuously reduces the cool core radius and increases @xmath64 ratio accordingly .",
    "the shock front in rxj0334.2 - 0111 is only @xmath0 50 kpc from the center of the cluster .",
    "therefore , it has yet to propagate through the outskirts of the system .",
    "the bow shock is located ahead of the wat radio galaxy , 3c89 , the only wat in a known merging galaxy clusters .",
    "since the core passage occurred only @xmath0 50 myr ago , rxj0334.2 - 0111 provides an excellent opportunity to study the effects of mergers on the cool core survival , jet bending etc .",
