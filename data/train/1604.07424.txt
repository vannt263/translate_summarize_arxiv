    "recently , batyginbrown2016 have found that the orbits of long period kuiper belt objects cluster in their arguments of perihelion and also in physical space in the solar system .",
    "they suggest that dynamical perturbations arising from a relatively small giant planet of perhaps 10 @xmath2 , on an eccentric orbit with a semi - major axis distance of perhaps @xmath7  700 au , can explain this clustering .",
    "the formation , evolution , and detectability of this possible `` planet nine '' has been the target of intense study marcos16,malholtra16,li16,linder16,cowan16,fienga2016,ginzburg2016 , brownbatygin2016,kenyon16,bromley16,mustill16,holman16 . to date",
    ", studies that have included discussion of the atmosphere , emission , or cooling history of the planet have focused on planet nine as a blackbody .",
    "this is certainly a valid starting point , especially since nothing is yet known about this _",
    "possible _ object . yet",
    "a straightforward , but more detailed look at the planet yields a better understanding of the planet s atmosphere , evolution , and spectra that can not come out of simple analysis . for instance , the spectra of the solar system s giant planets differ strongly from blackbodies .",
    "planet nine , if it exists , may have a mass between that of earth and uranus .",
    "exoplanets in this mass range are extremely common borucki11 . should planet nine be detected , the characterization of the planet would either confirm or refute studies such as the one we present here , and could serve as a proxy for the physical and atmospheric properties of the as - yet largely unstudied worlds that are among the most common outcomes of the planetary formation process .    in this letter",
    "we first investigate the cooling history of the planet nine , over a wide range of possible masses from 550 @xmath2 . here",
    "we assume a planet that has at least some h / he atmosphere , in analogy with uranus and neptune as well as the thousands of sub - neptune exoplanets that suggest a non - negligible h / he envelope lopez14 .",
    "we draw connections between the cooling history of planet nine and our incomplete understanding of the thermal evolution of uranus and neptune . with fluxes from the planet s interior and from the sun then reasonably well - bounded , we can begin to estimate the atmospheric temperature structure .",
    "we assess the condensation of methane , atmospheric opacity sources , and the spectrum of the planet from optical to thermal infrared wavelengths , focusing on novel and at times counter - intuitive behavior at very low temperature ( @xmath8 k ) .",
    "finally , we apply these findings to a revised assessment of the detectability of planet nine and report on a new search of the wise catalog .",
    "in order to estimate the possible radius and intrinsic luminosity of planet nine we have run neptune - like thermal evolution models , where we varied several structure parameters around those appropriate for neptune .",
    "these models are somewhat similar to those of linder16 , although we make different choices about particular compositions to investigate . here",
    "we assume planet masses between 5 and 50 @xmath2(@xmath9 @xmath2 ) and two compositionally different layers consisting of a h / he envelope atop a core that is either ice - rich ( 2@xmath101 ice@xmath10rock ) or ice - poor ( 1@xmath104 ice@xmath10rock ) .",
    "we varied the core mass fraction within 0.10.3 for the most massive models , representing a sub - saturn mass gas giant , 0.300.84 for a 15@xmath2  series of models , and 0.60.9 for the least massive models of 58 @xmath2 , representing a sub - neptune . for reference",
    ", constraints from neptune suggest @xmath1 0.760.90 ice / rock by mass @xcite , and detailed modeling suggests a ice - enriched h / he envelope atop very ice / rock rich deep interior @xcite .",
    "like @xcite we represent the warm fluid ices in the interior by the water equation of state ( eos ) h@xmath4o - reos.1 , h / he the updated h / he - reos.3 tables of @xcite , and for the rock eos @xcite .",
    "we followed the thermal evolution of planet nine at 1000 au , corresponding to a zero - albedo equilibrium temperature of 9 k. we explored a range of incident fluxes but found that is yielded little impact on the thermal evolution .",
    "for the upper boundary condition , the radiative atmosphere , we applied an analytic description @xcite of to the non - gray graboske75 model atmosphere grid , which relates the 1-bar temperature ( and hence the specific entropy of the interior adiabat ) and surface gravity to the @xmath0 . for the constant of proportionality between the 1-bar temperature and the @xmath0  we use @xmath11 based on neptune .",
    "we assume a hot start initial condition [ e.g.][]marley07 and then adiabatic cooling thereafter .",
    "at all points in the evolutionary history we track the evolution of the intrinsic luminosity and radius .",
    "see @xcite for further modeling details .",
    "our modelling results for planet nine are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we recover the strong influence of the assumed h / he mass fraction on the resulting radius , as it is well known from mass - radius relations for warm exoplanets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the radius of planet nine may reach from 2.7 to 4.4 @xmath3  if its mass is within 58 @xmath2 , or from 3.6 to 6.7 @xmath3  if 1520 @xmath2  ( neptune : 3.9 @xmath3 ) , and further to 6.48.3 @xmath3  if 3550 @xmath2 .",
    "intrinsic temperatures range from the uranian upper limit of @xmath12 if @xmath13@xmath2to sub - saturn like values of @xmath14 k for @xmath15 @xmath2 .",
    "as expected , we find @xmath16 to rise with planet mass , but , surprisingly , to decrease with h / he content .",
    "the latter behavior results from the larger energy that can be radiated away from a larger surface area , and from the low internal temperatures along the h / he adiabats at @xmath17 mbar pressures .    on the whole",
    ", we find excellent agreement with the findings of linder16 .",
    "we agree that the planet s luminosity is likely strongly dominated by intrinsic flux , rather than re - radiated solar energy .",
    "specifically , they suggest a @xmath0  of 47 k for a 10 @xmath2  planet model with a 1:1 ice : rock core and 1.4 @xmath2  envelope , which suggests an agreement within a few kelvin for our cooling models , based on our table 1 .    these results should be taken with significant caution .",
    "while adiabatic cooling models can reproduce the current intrinsic flux from neptune , they significantly overestimate the flux from within uranus , which has been an outstanding problem for decades hubbard95,fortney10 .",
    "therefore these @xmath16  and @xmath0  values should be taken as upper limits .",

    "the vapor pressure ( and hence mole fraction ) of methane above the cloud is _ independent of metallicity _ and is directly tied to the atmospheric temperature structure , such that a determination of the methane mole fraction would serve as a  thermometer \" of the visible atmosphere .",

    "all absorption features in the red model spectrum are due to h@xmath4 cia . in addition , the loss of methane opacity shifts a prominent flux maximum from 4 + @xmath6 m to @xmath21 @xmath6 m , which dramatically alters the flux ratio in the two shortest _ wise _ and _ spitzer _ bands . tabulated thermal infrared magnitudes are given in table 2 .    our previously mentioned uncertain opacities at low temperature lead to some qualifications on our conclusions .",
    "a strong enhancement of flux from 3 - 5@xmath6 m is robust .",
    "the large h@xmath4 cia opacities at tens of microns , with a pronounced minimum at 3 - 4 @xmath6 m , is a generic outcome at any temperature [ e.g.][figure 15]sharp07 , which forces flux into these opacities windows , as is well understood in brown dwarf and giant planet atmospheres .",

    "this could depress the 3 - 5 @xmath6 m flux compared to the cloud - free case , which emerges from deep , hotter atmospheric layers . even with potentially dramatic flux enhancements ,",
