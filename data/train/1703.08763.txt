    "[ subsec:3.3 ] are quite similar to those reported in the correspondence gi @xcite . for example , using only the measurements with large fluctuations can reduce the number of measurement involved in the reconstructed image calculation , and the larger fluctuations are , the fewer measurements are needed . rather than a coincident , we believe this is due to the same dynamics behind , even though the image calculation formula is different . in both systems",
    ", the bucket detector output has a gaussian pdf , which decreases as the fluctuation increases . in our case",

    "[ fig:5](d ) shows the relationship between converge parameter @xmath38 , which denotes the number of measurement required in the bucket fluctuation post - selection calculation , and the `` effective '' ratio  how many measurements in all that being complemented can fulfill the varying fluctuation requirements .",
    "fitting result suggests a linear relationship .",
    "since the total number of measurement stays the same , one can see that reduction of required measurement number is merely due to that fewer measurements can meet the harsher fluctuation requirement  which makes the satisfying measurements rarer , and can not reduce the total number of measurement to be conducted at the first place .",

    "_ applicable range _ * one may think that the above negative exponential behavior of image quality versus measurement number relationship is limited to situations with gaussian pdf or take mutual information as the image quality assessment .",

    "our model applies to a quite general scenario thanks to the fundamentality of information theory .    *",
    "_ significance _ * our work is important to the gi community in several ways .",
    "first , we provide a semi - quantitative model of the image quality versus measurement number relationship , enabling accurate prediction of the expected image quality after certain number of measurement , and the necessary measurement number to meet any given image quality requirement .",
    "second , explicit connections between gi parameters and concepts in information theory may lead to a new perspective of interdisciplinary research , which we hope could benefit the comparative new and less developed gi study in return .",
    "last but not least , the similar behavior of image mutual information with usual image quality assessments , e.g. , mean square error , contrast - to - noise ratio , imaging signal - to - noise ratio , meanwhile the unique insensitivity to specified coordinate within the aoi , suggests that imi ( and differential imi ) is a promising candidate for content - free image quality assessment .    in conclusion",
    ", we report the observation , modeling , and verification of the negative exponential behavior when use image mutual information to assess the image quality of pseudo - thermal light ghost imaging , with respect to the measurement number .",
    "rooted in the fundamental information theory , the model applies to a much more general scenario .",
