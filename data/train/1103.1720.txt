    "* the coupled cell networks . * + in the recent years , the mathematical study of coupled cell networks has been quickly developing .",
    "it combines several interests : it is strongly related with applications and real phenomena , the setting is very simple and it leads to a rich class of mathematically interesting problems . a coupled cell network models a group of agents , each one interacting with a given part of the others through differential equations .",
    "it is represented by an directed graph , each node being one of the agents and each directed arrow representing which agent acts on which one . this modelling appears in many concrete situations : networks of neurons , cellular metabolic networks , food webs in ecosystems , economic networks etc .",
    "many good arguments for studying coupled cell networks are given in @xcite .",
    "many examples of coupled cell networks can also be found in @xcite and @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the mathematical setting is the following .",
    "let @xmath0 be a directed graph with @xmath6 cells linked with arrows .",
    "to the cell @xmath2 , we associate a phase space @xmath7 of finite dimension @xmath8 , which is assumed in this paper to be the torus @xmath9 ( this assumption is made for sake of simplicity in our proofs , but our results also hold if @xmath7 is a more general manifold , including @xmath10 , see section [ sect - further ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for any @xmath13 and any set of indices @xmath14",
    ", @xmath15 denotes the image of the canonical projection of @xmath16 onto @xmath17 ( if @xmath18 , we simply write @xmath19 ) .",
    "we also denote by @xmath20 the dimension of @xmath21 .",
    "for each cell @xmath2 , the _ direct inputs _ of @xmath2 is the set of cells @xmath22 such that the arrow @xmath5 belongs to @xmath0 .",
    "a node @xmath22 is an _ indirect input _ of @xmath2 if there exists a sequence of arrows @xmath23 belonging to @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the space of the @xmath25vector fields on @xmath26 endowed with the usual banach topology ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) . to simplify the notations , for any @xmath13",
    ", we identify @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath24 with @xmath29 .",
    "we introduce the subspace of all the _ admissible vector fields _ @xmath30 with each @xmath31 , we associate the dynamical system @xmath32 , called _ coupled cell network _ , generated by the differential equation @xmath33 notice that , since @xmath26 is compact and @xmath3 is of class @xmath34 , the solutions of exist for all times .",
    "@xmath35    the properties of @xmath36 may strongly depend on the structure of the directed graph @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce here some definitions .",
    "[ defi - graph ] @xmath37    we say that a cell @xmath2 is an _ observation cell _ if any cell @xmath22 of @xmath0 with @xmath38 is an indirect input of @xmath2 .    we say that a set of cells @xmath39 is an _ independent sub - network _",
    "if @xmath39 contains all its indirect inputs , i.e. if the system restricted to the set of cells @xmath39 is still an autonomous ode .",
    "we say that the graph @xmath0 is _ strongly connected _ if any cell is an observation cell or equivalently if any cell is an indirect input of any other one .",
    "we say that the graph @xmath0 is _ self - dependent _ if any cell is a direct input of itself .",
    "we say that the graph @xmath0 is _ dimensionally decreasing _",
    "_ dimensionally non - increasing _ ) if the following property holds .",
    "let @xmath39 be any non - trivial set of cells i.e. @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 be its set of direct inputs .",
    "then , the dimension @xmath43 is larger than @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "larger or equal to @xmath44 ) .",
    "we would like to emphasise several important remarks concerning the above setting : + 1 ) we recall that we have assumed that the phase space of each cell is a torus , when it is usually @xmath45 or a more general manifold , because the compactness of @xmath7 and the triviality of its tangent bundle simplify the statement and the proof of several of our results . in this way , we avoid technicalities , which are not the subject of this paper . however , we underline that the results of this article are also valid for @xmath10 or other manifolds , see section [ sect - further ] .",
    "+ 2 ) another difference between our notations and the usual ones is that we do not introduce a relation of equivalence between cells and arrows .",
    "this kind of relation is introduced to model symmetries as in @xcite .",
    "for example , it is natural to assume that several neurons of the same type interact in the same way , that is that the functions @xmath46 corresponding to these interactions are equal .",
    "our purpose being to prove generic results with respect to these @xmath46 , adding constraints of symmetry increases the difficulty of the problem .",
    "since this paper is a first step in this subject , we have chosen to avoid this difficulty . however , adapting the results of this article to the presence of symmetries could be an interesting subject of future research .",
    "+ 3 ) a strongly connected graph is sometimes called a transitive graph or a path - connected graph .",
    "but , in graph theory , a transitive graph is a graph such that if the arrows @xmath47 exist then @xmath48 also exists .",
    "thus , we decided to use the term `` strongly connected '' , which seems to be the usual one in graph theory .    * a series of observation problems . *",
    "+ at first sight , a coupled cell network is a simple ode and one may wonder why it brings new topics of research .",
    "the important characteristics of the coupled cell networks is the splitting in several cells and the constraints due to the structure of the interactions described by the graph @xmath0 .",
    "this yields several classes of problems .",
    "for example , one can study the creation and the stability of patterns according to the symmetries of the network .",
    "this seems to be one of the main classes of questions , which have been studied until now ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite as well as the many related works ) .",
    "another class is the observability problems , which are the subject of this paper and has been previously tackled in @xcite .",
    "basically , one wonders if one can deduce the behaviour of the whole network only by observing one of the cells .",
    "we investigate here three problems .",
    "_ problem 1 : inverse problem .",
    "_ + can one distinguish two trajectories by only looking at one cell ? + _ problem 2 : observation of oscillations . _",
    "+ one of the cells is oscillating with a period @xmath49 , are the other cells also oscillating ? + _ problem 3 : observation of stabilisation . _",
    "+ one of the cells is stabilising and converging to an equilibrium state , have the other cells the same behaviour ?    these kinds of questions are natural in the context of coupled cell network modelling . for example , if one considers an economical network , it is impossible to measure the behaviour of all the economical agents .",
    "one would like to know if the measures of a small number of indices is sufficient to know if the economy is chaotic , oscillating or stable .",
    "inverse problem are also motivated by the desire of controlling a whole network that can be observed only through a small number of parameters ( as it is the case for a whole organism or an ecosystem ) .",
    "if one can not distinguish two trajectories by observing a small part of the network , then one can not know in which state the whole network is and therefore what control one should impose .    * the necessity and the meaning of generic results . *",
    "+ the first answer to problems 1 - 3 is simply `` no '' . of course , there is firstly a problem with the geometry of the graph @xmath0 : two cells have totally independent behaviours if they are not interacting , even indirectly .",
    "but , even with a nice strongly connected network , it is not difficult to construct particular interactions @xmath46 such that the observation properties fail .",
    "so , at a second time , one could be tempted to obtain a criterion on @xmath3 , for which observability is possible .",
    "however , what is the usefulness of a criterion such as `` these two biological parameters must have irrational ratio '' ? in physics ,",
    "interactions have a well - known structure .",
    "but , in biology or economy , one may have no precise idea of the form of the interactions @xmath46 . in these cases ,",
    "a concrete criterion has no meaning .",
    "in this situation , one must use the concept of generic properties .",
    "the idea is to show that for almost all the possible interactions , problems 1 - 3 have positive answers .",
    "then , one believes that , when one deals with a concrete network , the observations properties surely hold for this network . in this paper , we fix a given directed graph @xmath0 and by `` almost all the possible interactions '' , we mean a generic subset of the admissible vector fields @xmath50 .",
    "we recall that a generic subset is a subset that contains a countable intersection of dense open subsets .",
    "since @xmath50 is a banach space , generic subsets are dense and the use of the notion of generic subsets to characterise large subsets is well admitted .",
    "generic results are meaningful in network s problems , where the functions of interactions @xmath46 are not completely a priori determined ( typically in food webs in ecosystems , in metabolic networks ... ) , so that one can hope that the considered network is a generic one .",
    "if @xmath3 is precisely determined ( typically in networks following simple physical laws ) , a generic result is meaningless . if the interactions follow some symmetries ( typically in neuronal networks ) , then one should prove a generic result in the class @xmath50 restricted to interactions having these symmetries .    * main results * + the inverse problem , problem 1 , depends on the geometry of the network @xmath0 ( it is noteworthy that it is our only theorem which does not hold for any strongly connected graph ) .",
    "the inverse problem may fail if there are some cells on which the trajectories are constant ( see the counter - example of section [ sect - eq - diff ] ) . in sections [ sect - eq ] and [ sect - inv ] , we state different properties related to this inverse problem , which give a sharp idea of the cases where it may not hold .",
    "they may be summarised in the following simple statement .",
    "[ th1 ] * observation of trajectories * + let @xmath0 be a given directed graph .",
    "there exists a generic subset @xmath51 of @xmath50 such that for any @xmath52 the following property holds .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 be two solutions of and let @xmath2 be an observation cell .",
    "assume that there is a time interval @xmath55 , @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "then , the whole trajectories @xmath53 and @xmath54 coincide , except maybe in the cells where the trajectories @xmath53 and @xmath54 are both constant . moreover , if the graph @xmath0 is either a self - dependent directed graph , or a dimensionally decreasing graph , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 coincide everywhere , even in the cells where the trajectories @xmath53 and @xmath54 are both constant .",
    "the observation of oscillations stated in problem 2 is a natural problem , which has already been studied in @xcite .",
    "it is proved there that , in self - dependent and strongly connected graph , hyperbolic periodic orbits have generically no constant cells .",
    "we obtain here a stronger result in several directions : no hyperbolicity of periodic orbit is needed , no self - dependence is assumed , all the cells are not only oscillating but also oscillate with the same period and the constant cells are observable only in constant solutions .    in theorem [ th2 ]",
    "below , we use the following notations .",
    "we say that a function @xmath59 is _",
    "@xmath60periodic _ on @xmath55 if @xmath61 for any @xmath62 .",
    "we say that a function @xmath59 is _",
    "exactly @xmath60periodic _ on @xmath55 if @xmath63 is the smallest number such that @xmath64 is @xmath60periodic on @xmath55 .",
    "[ th2 ] * observation of oscillations * + let @xmath0 be a given directed graph .",
    "there exists a generic subset @xmath65 of @xmath50 such that for any @xmath66 the following properties hold .",
    "let @xmath53 be a solution of , then    * if there is a cell @xmath2 such that @xmath67 is constant on some time interval @xmath55 , then @xmath67 , as well as any @xmath4 with @xmath22 being an indirect input of the cell @xmath2 , is constant on @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath2 is an observation cell , then @xmath53 is an equilibrium point of . *",

    "notice that theorem [ th2 ] is not in contradiction with the examples of @xcite , even the ones which are stable with respect to perturbations of @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , we assume here no a priori symmetry for the interactions @xmath46 .",
    "our last result concerns problem 3 , that is the observation of stabilisation .",
    "it is a natural problem since the stabilisation of a network is an important issue in many applications : economy , ecosystems , metabolism ...

    ", we investigate the observation problem for equilibrium states of the network .",
    "we also prove the generic simplicity of equilibrium points , which is an interesting property by itself .",
    "the inverse problem stated in theorem [ th1 ] is proved in section [ sect - inv ] and , in section [ sect - coro ] , theorem [ th2 ] and [ th3 ] are deduced from the previous results . finally , we present further results in section [ sect - further ] , in particular the non - compact case of @xmath10 and the case of discrete networks .",
    "* acknowledgements : * the author would like to thank martin golubitsky and genevive raugel for pointing to him the interest of coupled cell networks .",
    "several discussions have also been useful for the writing of this paper : matthieu lautaud and vincent perrollaz have enhanced to the author the interest of studying problem 1 and 3 and benot kloeckner has patiently answered many questions about differential geometry .",
    "in a space @xmath26 , which admits a natural measure , the notion of `` almost everywhere '' as sets of full measure is natural and well admitted .",
    "as soon as the space @xmath26 is infinite - dimensional and has no natural measure , the meaning of `` almost everywhere '' is less clear . if @xmath26 is a baire space ( typically a complete space ) , then the most used notion of `` almost everywhere '' is the notion of generic subsets , that are subsets of @xmath26 containing a countable intersection of dense open subsets of @xmath26 .",
