    "faceted polytetrahedral rock - shaped particles as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpix](a ) were produced by modifying a synthesis to produce poly - methyl - methacrylate ( pmma ) colloids stablised with poly - hydroxy stearic acid @xcite .",
    "details of the synthesis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the particle size is expressed as @xmath2 @xmath3 m , the longest dimension of each rock in images such as fig . [ figpix](a ) .",
    "it is hard to determine the polydispersity for these particles , which have both shape and some size polydispersity .",
    "however , inspection of sem images suggests that the size polydispersity is @xmath4% .",
    "the colloidal rocks were labelled with rhodamine iso - thiocynate fluorescent dye . to investigate the change induced by anisotropy we also used spherical pmma particles , of diameter @xmath5 @xmath3 m with 4% polydispersity determined by static light scattering .",
    "the colloids were dispersed in a density- and refractive index matching mixture of cis - decalin and cyclohexyl bromide ( chb ) , to which was added 4 mmol of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide salt to screen electrostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "polystyrene polymer was added to induce depletion attractions .",
    "the polymer used was @xmath6 g / mo in the case of the rocks and @xmath7 g / mol for the spheres resulting in polymer radii of gyration of @xmath8 nm and @xmath9 nm @xcite and a polymer - colloid size ratio @xmath10 of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . with the exception of the modest change in interaction range , the experimental conditions were identical for both rocks ( @xmath13 ) and spheres ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the colloid volume fraction @xmath15 was determined by weighing out the samples .",
    "we track the colloid coordinates in 3d using confocal microscopy images .",
    "the rocks are sufficiently large with an intensity maximum at the centre of the particle that algorithms developed for spheres @xcite identify the rock centres effectively with an error @xmath16 nm .",
    "particles were defined as bonded if their centres lay within the interaction range @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 @xmath3 m and @xmath19 @xmath3 m for the rocks and spheres respectively .",
    "moderate changes in this bond length had no significant impact on our results .",
    "geometry introduces two key differences between the rocks and spheres relevant to depletion attractions as indicated in fig . [ figpix](b ) .",
    "firstly , for rocks the overlap of excluded volume , which drives the depletion interaction , is much reduced compared to spheres .",
    "this is due to the concave shape of the rocks which means that much of the volume from which the polymers are excluded can not overlap due to the approach of two rocks .",
    "this is shown by the pink regions in fig .",
    "[ figpix](b ) which denote excluded volume , while the black is the colloidal particle .",
    "blue denotes regions where overlap of excluded volume is prevented due to the concave faces .",
    "thus we expect that more polymer is required in the case of the rocks , for a given degree of attraction .",
    "secondly , the faces of the rocks lead to multiple overlap zones as shown by the overlapping pink regions in fig .",
    "[ figpix](b ) .",
    "these impose an energetic penalty to rotation , which is absent in the case of spheres .",
    "both points were confirmed by calculations with model rocks and ideal polymer .",
    "confocal microscopy images of gels of rocks and spheres are shown in fig . [",
    "figpix](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the difference is striking : rocks form one - particle wide chains while spheres form densely packed structures .",
    "this provides direct evidence for a different bonding scenario in the two species , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ figpix](b ) .",
    "we identify gelation with a percolating network of long - lived bonds .",
    "gel dynamics are shown in supplementary movie 1 .",
    "in finite sized microscope images , it can be hard to directly measure percolation .",
    "we therefore determine percolation through the ratio @xmath20 as shown in fig [ figperky](a ) , where @xmath21 is the length of the largest connected cluster and @xmath22 is the image size .",
    "gelation is thus identified with a rapid rise in the ratio @xmath20 .",
    "the polymer _ mass _ fraction for gelation @xmath23 in the case of spheres is @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the rocks , which corresponds to a _ volume _ fraction @xmath26 of @xmath27 for the spheres and @xmath28 for the rocks . here",
    "the polymer volume fraction is defined @xmath29 where @xmath30 is polymer number density .",
    "we attribute this fivefold change in polymer volume fraction required for gelation to the much reduced overlap volume in the case of the rocks .",
    "effects due to different polymer - colloid size ratios and polymer non - ideality were estimated to be small @xcite .",
    "the difference between the rocks and spheres in the structure at the particle level is also striking , as shown by the radial distribution functions in fig . [ figgnn](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "data for spheres has been compared against computer simulation for hard spheres in @xcite , showing excellent agreement .",
    "the rocks show similar behaviour , indicating that the colloids are stable against aggregation . at higher polymer concentration , although both species show a strong increase in the first peak upon gelation , in the case of spheres , the onset of gelation ( @xmath31 ) coincides with @xmath32 for @xmath33 , indicating clustering / dense regions in agreement with fig . [ figpix](d ) .",
    "this behaviour is entirely absent in the case of the rocks [ fig .",
    "[ figpix](c ) ] .",
    "in other words , for spheres , phase separation has already begun before gelation sets in : gelation is driven by the arrest due to the development of the dense phase @xcite , once it has formed on a lengthscale of several particles .",
    "the rocks show no signs of locally dense regions : gelation is driven soley by rigid bonds .",
    "similar conclusions may be reached by considering the number of neighbours of a given particle [ fig .",
    "[ figgnn](c , d ) ] . in the case of spheres",
    ", the onset of phase separation ( gelation ) leads to a considerable change in the number of neighbours , indicating locally dense regions .",
    "rocks on the other hand show no such indication of phase separation . in other words , rocks have a reduced valency induced by their geometry with some similarity to patchy particles @xcite .",
    "this bonding and local structure has significant implications for the network formation . to quantify the structure",
    ", we use a local ` fractal dimension ' , @xmath34 , for finite assemblies of particles , which is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the radius of gyration of a connected region of @xmath37 particles , as shown in fig . [",
    "figperky](b ) . at the low packing fractions we consider , the fluid phase forms clusters , whose @xmath34 is found in the same way .",
    "we plot the resulting @xmath38 in fig . [",
    "figperky](c ) .",
    "spheres and rocks show an increase in @xmath38 upon increasing the polymer concentration , up to gelation , after which non - ergodicity leads to a failure to relax locally and a decrease in @xmath38 , as found previously @xcite",
    ". however , the fractal dimension of rock clusters and gels is significantly lower than that of spheres .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the sphere - based clusters have already begun to condense ( leading to an increase in @xmath38 ) , while the rock clusters show no signs of such condensation .",
    "we note that for the rock gels , the measured fractal dimension is even less than that expected for dlca where @xmath39 .",
    "this is surprising : dlca assumes unbreakable bonds , which is entirely different from the weak depletion - induced gelation expected in colloid - polymer mixtures .",
    "for rocks ( a ) and spheres ( b ) , respectively . dashed line in ( b ) denotes the approximate lengthscale of incipient phase separation for the spheres .",
    "data are shifted for clarity .",
    "distributions of the number of neighbours @xmath40 for rocks ( c ) and spheres ( d ) , respectively .",
    "labels denote @xmath41.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]   for rocks ( a ) and spheres ( b ) , respectively .",

    "distributions of the number of neighbours @xmath40 for rocks ( c ) and spheres ( d ) , respectively .",
    "labels denote @xmath41.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    we have argued that the only relevant difference between the rocks and spheres lies in their shapes and now enquire as to the geometrical origins of the rock behaviour .",
    "unlike other approaches to produce networks with low fractal dimension which rely on a few sticky patches on each particle to reduce the number of bonds @xcite , here we consider only the particle geometry with no restriction on the number of neighbours a particle can have , except the steric limitation which also applies to particle with a spherically symmetric interaction .",
    "we introduce a model based on dodecahedral assemblies of 20 overlapping spheres whose centres lie on a sphere , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figpix](e ) .",
    "this model was choosen as a simple representation of the rock shape , as it is reasonably resistant to ordered packing , and the faces should mimic the rigid bonding of the rocks .",
    "these ( small ) spheres have a diameter of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the diameter of the circumscribed sphere .",
    "the volume of a set of overlaping spheres can be calculated exactly by e.g. the connolly algorithm @xcite and is approximately 0.416 @xmath44 for these model rocks .    for short ranged attractions ,",
    "the detailed form of the interaction potential is irrelevant for many properties @xcite , so we treat the attractions that result from the addition of polymer with a square well of width @xmath45 and depth @xmath46 .",
    "we also carry out simulations of spheres of diameter @xmath47 interacting via the square well potential of width @xmath48 . using the extended law of corresponding states , @xcite , this maps to a polymer - colloid size ratio of @xmath49 , comparable to the experiments . here",
    "we focus on the geometric properties , rather than the dynamics : our purpose is to demonstrate the qualitatively different nature of aggregation of spheres and rocks .",
    "we therefore use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in the canonical ensemble with 512 particles .",
    "simulations with more ( 2048 ) particles showed minimal differences , as for the state points we consider .",
    "we use a short ( @xmath50 ) and long ( @xmath51 ) translational step for both spheres and rocks .",
    "the former enables local restructuring of bonded particles , the latter accelerates aggregation . for the rocks , small ( @xmath52 rad ) and",
    "large ( @xmath53 rad ) rotational moves are also used .",
    "each simulation is ` equilibrated ' for @xmath54 mc sweeps prior to sampling .",
    "each sweep involves attempted moves of all types .",
    "simulations are repeated at least six times .    in fig .",
    "[ figperky](d ) we plot fractal dimensions for simulations of rocks and spheres for packing fraction @xmath55 ( the experiments are carried out at @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the spheres exhibit similar behaviour as in the experiments , with @xmath56 when the system falls out of equilibrium on the simulation timescale .",
    "this we take as the strength of attraction associated with spinodal decomposition @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath57 , noting that for such short - ranged interactions , the spinodal line depends rather weakly on @xmath58 . for the rocks , we identify @xmath59 @xmath60 with the onset of a regime where the potential energy decreases continuously .",
    "both rock and sphere @xmath34 are lower than the experiments at low attraction , which may be related to the change in @xmath58 .",
    "the simulations clearly show that the rock clusters have a fractal dimension which is less than that of the spheres [ figs .",
    "[ figperky](c , d ) ] .",
    "in fact @xmath61 , even less than in the experiments .",
    "although the simulation results are presented for a lower density the agreement between experiment and simulation adds further weight to our hypothesis that ( _ i _ ) the rocks have an intrinsically different bonding mechanism compared to spheres driven by geometry and ( _ ii _ ) that their behaviour is qualitatively captured by the dodecahedral clusters . since the rocks can bond to as many neighbours as they have faces , they they can form dense phases and therefore , at equilibrium dense and dilute phases coexist so the rock gels should be metastable .",
    "the fractal dimension of rock clusters , both in experiments with percolating networks and simulations of isolated clusters is low , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , lower even than dlca .",
    "cates _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite , suggested that similar behaviour might be found in spheres , if they were suddenly  and deeply  quenched to the regime where dlca dominates .",
    "the rock geometry may be interpreted as exhibiting similar behaviour with much weaker attractions .    finally , we consider the high density behaviour . in experiments without polymer ,",
    "rocks did not crystallise at a packing fraction @xmath64 on a timescale of one week ( fig .",
    "[ figdenseg ] ) .",
    "this is reasonable , as it has recently been shown that only a limited degree of asphericity is required to suppress crystallisation @xcite .",
    "supplementary movie 2 shows that rocks at @xmath64 exhibit glassy dynamics , with displacement hindered by their neighbours .",
    "we find that the radial distribution function of dense amorphous packings of rocks at @xmath64 has peak locations and a decay of the oscillations similar to the @xmath65 of spheres at @xmath66 [ fig .",
    "[ figdenseg](a ) ] .",
    "this indicates that the longer - range structure is similar , suggesting an effective packing fraction for the rocks higher than @xmath64 , likely due to the concave geometry .",
    "the failure of the rocks to crystallise indicates that they are a ` quasi one - component glass former ' .     of rocks at @xmath67 ( pink squares ) and @xmath65 of spheres at @xmath66 ( black circles ) from experiments .",
