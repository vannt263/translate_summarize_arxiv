    "since the groundbreaking work of kenneth wilson @xcite , a proof of confinement for quantum chromodynamics in the continuum limit is lacking .",
    "this is expected to be one of the major goals for our understanding of low - energy behavior of hadronic matter . since then , a lot of fundamental work has been pursued reaching a deeper comprehension of the problem @xcite .",
    "stated in its simplest way , the confinement problem can be expressed through the behavior of the expectation value of the wilson loop that , for a free theory , is just reduced to the computation of a double path integral on the propagator of the theory .",
    "when this expectation takes the simple form @xmath0 , being @xmath1 the area spanned by the loop and @xmath2 a constant called string tension , one has that the _ area law _ holds and the potential rises linearly with the distance granting completely bounded states .",
    "this result has been confirmed by computations on lattice @xcite and is generally stated as `` cornell potential '' being the sum of coulombian and linearly rising terms .",
    "the main problem to face to understand confinement is that the theory at low energies is strongly coupled .",
    "this means that perturbation theory is no more reliable to perform computations .",
    "besides , very few techniques are available to manage the theory in this limit and , generally , one resorts to numerical studies on a lattice .",
    "indeed , recent studies of the propagators of a pure yang - mills theory produced some striking results . these results on huge volumes , arriving to such a significant value as @xmath3 , were presented at the lattice 2007 conference in regensburg @xcite .",
    "the shocking conclusion was that the scenario devised since then @xcite , generally accepted as correct , was not describing the situation seen on the lattice in three and four dimensions : the gluon propagator was reaching a plateau at lower momenta with a finite non - zero value in zero , rather than being zero there , and the ghost propagator was behaving as that of a free massless particle while an enhanced one was expected .",
    "all in all , the running coupling was seen to bend clearly toward zero @xcite without evidence of a non - trivial fixed point as was expected instead .",
    "anyhow , there is not a widespread agreement on the definition of the running coupling in the infrared limit .",
    "the scenario that emerged has an interesting interpretation . assuming that an infrared trivial fixed point for a pure yang - mills theory exists @xcite , the theory can be easily managed through a perturbation expansion .",
    "the propagator we obtain can be used to get several properties of the theory and qcd as well @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show that this propagator , by itself , implies a screened potential and so , it needs a next - to - leading order correction to recover a cornell potential and confinement .",
    "it is important to point out that , while yang - mills theory has an infrared trivial fixed point , this is no more true for qcd due to the presence of quarks .",
    "besides , what makes small a running coupling is just the decreasing of momenta that are expected to go to zero like the fourth power . as we will see , the excellent agreement with numerical data , till a perfect coincidence for numerical solution of dyson - schwinger equations @xcite , is strongly supporting this view .",
    "this implies that the definition of the running coupling discussed in these papers is acceptable in the infrared limit and we are exploiting this possibility .",
    "finally , we emphasize that a decoupling solution for the gluon propagator does not grant a potential behaving as the cornell potential with a linearly rising term but rather a screened potential . this has been recently shown , numerically solving dyson - schwinger equations , by gonzalez , vento and mathieu @xcite . as we will show in this paper",
    ", the reason for this is that we need loop corrections to the propagator in the infrared limit . in this way , a quartic term in the momenta",
    "is seen to appear , in agreement with a gribov - like propagator , providing the needed linearly rising term in the potential .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec.[sec2 ] , we present the formalism applied to scalar field and yang - mills theories . in sec.[sec3 ] , we show a comparison with numerical data strongly supporting the formalism . in sec.[sec4 ] , we give the next - to - leading order correction to the propagator . in sec.[sec5 ] , we discuss the renormalized gluon propagator we obtained . in sec.[sec6 ] , we compute the interquark potential and the string tension .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec7 ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "in the eighties , carl bender and others @xcite proposed a new approach to cope with a strong coupled quantum field theory .",
    "this pioneering view was too radical and so , produced too singular results to be useful .",
    "but one can improve on it as we showed recently @xcite , assuming a bare coupling formally going to infinity .",
    "as we will show , immediate conclusions can be obtained both for scalar and yang - mills quantum field theories .",
    "we consider a massless neutral scalar field with the following generating functional @xmath4=n\\int [ d\\phi]\\exp\\left\\{i\\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\phi)^2-\\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\phi^4+j\\phi\\right]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in order to get a strong coupling expansion , we formally rescale space - time coordinates as @xmath5 . then , the functional takes the form @xmath4=n\\int [ d\\phi]\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{i}{\\lambda}\\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\phi)^2-\\frac{1}{4}\\phi^4+\\frac{1}{\\lambda}j\\phi\\right]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] but @xmath6 is an arbitrary function and so we rescale it as @xmath7 .",
    "now , a perturbative expansion can be written down as @xmath8 that yields the following terms into the action @xmath9 \\label{eq : ord0 } \\\\",
    "s_1&=&\\int d^4x\\left[\\partial\\phi_0\\partial\\phi_1-\\phi_0 ^ 3\\phi_1+j\\phi_1\\right ] \\label{eq : ord1 } \\\\",
    "s_2&=&\\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\phi_1)^2-\\frac{3}{2}\\phi_0 ^ 2\\phi_1 ^ 2 + \\partial\\phi_0\\partial\\phi_2-\\phi_0 ^ 3\\phi_2+j\\phi_2\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : ord2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that this expansion requires that we are able to solve the classical equation of motion @xmath10 in the limit @xmath11 . indeed , making use of this equation the following functional",
    "is obtained @xmath4\\approx e^{i\\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\phi_0)^2-\\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\phi_0 ^ 4+j\\phi_0\\right ] }     \\int[d\\phi_1 ]     e^{i\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\phi_1)^2-\\frac{3}{2}\\lambda\\phi_0 ^ 2\\phi_1 ^ 2\\right]}.\\ ] ] here @xmath12 is a functional of the current @xmath6 . in this form",
    ", we are not able to manage this expression .",
    "so , we make the ansatz @xcite @xmath13 and we need to solve the following equation for the green function @xmath14 ^ 3=\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\delta^4(x - x').\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of energy arising in the solution of the classical theory .",
    "then , using an iterative procedure , the next - to - leading order correction is @xmath16 ^ 3j(x'')\\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\       & -&\\left.\\mu^3\\left[\\int d^4x''\\delta(x'-x'')j(x'')\\right]^3\\right\\}+\\ldots.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] higher order corrections can be similarly obtained .",
    "finally , the propagator can be obtained explicitly @xcite .",
    "one has @xmath17 being @xmath18 with @xmath19 and a mass spectrum @xmath20 we recognize that the theory develops a mass gap due to the finiteness of the coupling .",
    "this result would be very difficult to obtain with a weak coupling expansion .",
    "but , another striking result is that this theory is infrared trivial as the generating functional in this limit is just gaussian @xmath21=n\\exp\\left[\\frac{i}{2}\\int d^4xd^4yj(x)\\delta(x - y)j(y)\\right].\\ ] ] this can be also evinced from the form of the propagator ( [ eq : prop ] ) that presents just simple poles and can be ascribed to a free theory of massive particles with a superimposed spectrum of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "finally , the next to leading order term takes the form @xmath22\\approx z_0[j]\\int [ d\\phi]\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{i}{\\lambda}\\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\phi)^2-\\frac{3}{2}\\lambda\\left(\\int d^4x_1\\delta(x - x_1)j(x_1)\\right)\\phi^2\\right]\\right\\}.\\ ] ]      the foundations for a possible understanding of qcd at low - energies were posed on the eighties @xcite .",
    "people realized that , with a current expansion , a sensible low - energy limit was obtained .",
    "but not a great step forward was possible due to the stumbling block of an unknown gluon propagator .",
    "this was a major obstacle to complete this program .",
    "we will now see how a consistent scenarion can indeed be built on this basis .",
    "we have the generating functional @xmath23&=&n\\exp\\left\\{-i\\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{4}{\\rm tr}f^2+\\frac{1}{2\\xi}(\\partial\\cdot a)^2      + ( \\bar c^a\\partial_\\mu\\partial^\\mu c^a+g\\bar c^a f^{abc}\\partial_\\mu a^{b\\mu}c^c)\\right]\\right\\}\\times \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\exp\\left[i\\int d^4x\\left(j^a_\\mu a^{\\mu a}+\\bar\\epsilon^a c^a+\\bar c^a\\epsilon^a\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath24 the field strength and @xmath25 the vector potential .",
    "exactly in the same way as for the scalar field , we operate a rescaling of space - time variable through the t hooft coupling @xmath26 for a su(n ) gauge group .",
    "so , again , we have to solve the classical equations of motion @xmath27 for an arbitrary gauge fixed through the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "now , we would like to study quantum field theory for yang - mills equations assuming that a trivial infrared fixed point exists . in order to get such a theory",
    ", we have to show that a set of classical solutions exist to build up the corresponding quantum field theory .",
    "indeed , this is the case and such solutions are instantons @xcite .",
    "this can be proved quite easily by putting @xmath29 being @xmath30 some constant coefficients .",
    "then , yang - mills equations collapse to @xmath31 in the lorenz ( landau ) gauge , this equation is further simplified and we can use the fact that @xmath32 and so we set @xmath33 . in this case , the theory reduces to that of the scalar field and we can easily do quantum field theory for a trivial infrared fixed point .",
    "quantum field theory will be build up on the instanton field @xmath34 that is replicated for each component of the yang - mills field .",
    "now , we are able to give explicitly the gluon propagator in the landau gauge as @xmath35 with @xmath36 given by eq.([eq : prop ] ) . here @xmath37 and we interchange the constants @xmath15 and @xmath38 .",
    "so , we can write the spectrum for su(n ) as @xmath39 this can be proven very easily from the definition of the two - point function . we have @xmath40 using our instanton solutions , one sees that @xmath41 giving our result . a possible choice for components of the gauge field is @xmath42 being @xmath43 the minkowski metric .",
    "we are now able to develop a quantum field theory for the yang - mills field supporting a trivial infrared fixed point .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we give here the ghost propagator .",
    "ghost field just decouples in the infrared limit due to the mapping theorem and so , @xmath44 then , the generating functional for the gauge field in the infrared limit takes the following gaussian form @xmath45&=&n'\\exp\\left[\\frac{i}{2}\\int d^4xd^4y     j^{\\mu a}(x)d_{\\mu\\nu}^{ab}(x - y)j^{\\nu b}(y)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\      & + & o\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}g}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] entailing triviality .",
    "the spectrum has a mass gap with a superimposed spectrum of a harmonic oscillator as if such particles would have a structure .",
    "we note that infrared triviality does not apply to qcd due to the presence of quarks .",
    "a priori , it is not clear why our classical solutions should be selected to build up a quantum field theory . even if our approach is consistent , we can not be sure that something should enter , and it is instead neglected , into the solutions needed for the theory .",
    "so , we need to compare our conclusions with numerical data from lattice and numerical dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "these studies have been pursued for some decades and reached their maturity with a significant breakthrough on 2007 where the gluon propagator was seen to reach a finite non - zero value lowering momenta @xcite .",
    "this was also confirmed by numerical studies of dyson - schwinger equations @xcite .",
    "firstly , the most important point to be assessed is the existence of the trivial fixed point at infrared ( momenta going to zero ) .",
    "as already said , this can be seen from recent lattice computations @xcite and numerical solution of dyson - schwinger equations @xcite provided one agrees on the definition of the running coupling at lower momenta . assuming this , we will show below the behavior of the running coupling for the latter case ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rc ] ) .",
    "we note also that , given a different definition of running coupling , a similar result has been given in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : rc ] , @xmath46 and @xmath47.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the definition of the running coupling is the one considered in @xcite and proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath48 having introduced the dressing functions for the gluon and ghost propagators respectively as @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in our fit from numerical solution to dyson - schwinger equations , it is seen to be very near the zero value as momenta goes to zero .",
    "this result is identical to the one presented in @xcite .",
    "we note that , with this definition , the running coupling goes to zero like @xmath51 while , with the definition given in @xcite , it runs to zero like @xmath52 .",
    "below we give the comparison with numerical results for the propagators .",
    "data for @xmath53 and dyson - schwinger equations were given directly from measurement while measurements at @xmath54 recovered from fig . 2 in @xcite .",
    "one sees that , increasing volumes , our propagator tends to the measured one and the agreement improves neatly in the deep infrared .",
    "different mass gaps are due to different values of @xmath55 . for numerical dyson - schwinger equations",
    "@xcite , one has no volume problem being already in the infinite limit and , indeed , we get perfect coincidence of our propagator with the measured one .",
    "note that we consider a weak dependence on the gauge group as showed in @xcite that is fully consistent with our discussion above .     with a mass gap of @xmath56     with a mass gap of @xmath57    ]",
    "these numerical results give a strong support to our scenario and to the conclusion of the existence of a trivial infrared fixed point for yang - mills theory .",
    "in sec . [ sec : ym ] , we have shown that , for a yang - mills theory with a trivial infrared fixed point , it is enough to study the corresponding quantum theory of the instanton solutions represented by a massless scalar field with a quartic self - interaction . for our aims , we need just to evaluate the next - to - leading order correction to the propagator and derive the potential from it as shown in @xcite .",
    "this will move us away from the infrared fixed point and will provide a comprehension on the theory approaching such a fixed point .",
    "so , from eq.([eq : delta ] ) we have to evaluate @xmath58 ^ 3\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the one given in eq.([eq : prop ] ) .",
    "we point out here that , for a yang - mills theory , we have to set @xmath60 .",
    "turning to momentum space this gives @xmath61 this integral is well - known in quantum field theory , it arises as a two loop sunrise diagram @xcite and , in the form given above , has not a closed form value .",
    "but , we are in the infrared limit and we need its value just in the limit of small momenta . but before we take small momenta limit , consistently with our approximation technique , we need to take the limit @xmath11 .",
    "this will give immediately @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\     & + & o\\left(\\lambda^{-\\frac{5}{2}}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set , using eq.([eq : ms ] ) , @xmath63 .",
    "these integrals are really singular but we note that we can not extend the integration range to infinity as we expect our computation to hold just for momenta @xmath64 , the cut - off of the theory that emerged by integration of the classical equations .",
    "so , the theory has a natural cut - off . in this way we can immediately evaluate the correction with the following integrals : @xmath65 so",
    ", we finally get @xmath66+o\\left(\\lambda^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\right).\\ ] ] we note that the cut - off disappears everywhere except as a scale for the momenta contribution as it should .",
    "now , we can interpret this as an expansion in inverse of @xmath67 of the denominator of the propagator and this means that we have to evaluate @xmath68&= & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "once we obtained the field renormalization constant @xmath72 , we can provide a next - to - leading order formula for the gluon propagator .",
    "let us introduce the constant @xmath73 and @xmath60 .",
    "we can rewrite the gluon propagator in the landau gauge in the following form @xmath74 where we have set @xmath75.\\ ] ] we note that the coefficients @xmath76 are exponentially damped with @xmath77 and so , just the first few terms give the physics of infrared yang - mills theory .",
    "this means that our propagator agrees fairly well with the one obtained in the refined gribov - zwanziger scenario @xcite .",
    "so , we can attempt to evaluate the condensates after the correction is introduced .",
    "as already done in @xcite , we consider just two terms in our propagator and write down @xmath78 in order to estimate the condensates , we note that @xmath79 obtained from the exact relation @xmath80 accounting for the exponential damping of higher coefficients . now , by the definition given in @xcite of the condensate , we get @xmath81.\\ ] ] in our previous work @xcite we get about @xmath82 for this condensate and our result here is not so much different from it .",
    "again , this is a proof of existence of such a condensate and our scenario agrees fairly well with that given in @xcite .",
    "in order to compute the potential in a pure yang - mills theory at the infrared fixed point , we have to evaluate @xmath83[d\\bar c][dc ] e^{-\\frac{i}{4}\\int d^4x{\\rm tr}f^2+is_g[\\bar c , c ] }      { \\rm tr}{\\cal p}e^{ig\\oint_{\\cal c } dx^\\mu t^aa^a_\\mu(x)}}{\\int [ da][d\\bar c][dc ] e^{-\\frac{i}{4}\\int d^4x{\\rm tr}f^2+is_g[\\bar c , c]}}\\ ] ] being @xmath84 $ ] the contribution of the ghost field , @xmath85 the anti - hermitian generators of the gauge group and @xmath86 the path ordering operator . in our case , in the infrared limit , we have a trivial fixed point .",
    "this implies that our generating functional takes a gaussian form @xmath21=\\exp\\left[\\frac{i}{2}\\int d^4x'd^4x''j^{a\\mu}(x')d_{\\mu\\nu}^{ab}(x'-x'')j^{b\\nu}(x'')\\right]\\ ] ] and so , the evaluation of the wilson loop is straightforwardly obtained as @xcite @xmath87=\\exp\\left[-\\frac{g^2}{2}c_2(r)\\oint_{\\cal c}dx^\\mu\\oint_{\\cal c}dy^\\nu d_{\\mu\\nu}(x - y)\\right]\\ ] ] being @xmath88 the quadratic casimir operator that for su(n ) in the fundamental representation , @xmath89 , is @xmath90 . in our case , the propagator has the form given in sec.[sec2 ] for the landau gauge .",
    "the fall - off to large distances of this propagator grants that ordinary arguments to evaluate the integrals on the path apply . indeed , using fourier",

    "so , in our case we have to evaluate the integral @xcite @xmath95 using eq.([eq : dg ] ) .",
    "if we neglect the contribution of the sunrise diagram we see that the propagator is a sum of yukawa propagators .",
    "this means that the above integral will yield a sum of yukawa potentials and we get an overall screened potential that does not grant confinement as discussed in @xcite .",
    "so , we see that in the deep infrared , one - gluon exchange does not grant a confining theory .",
    "but , accounting also for our two - loop correction , we will have to compute instead @xmath96 we can now evaluate this integral by rewriting it in the form @xmath97 where we have considered the limit @xmath11 , @xmath98 even after a renormalization of mass @xmath99 is taken , @xmath80 and we have set @xmath100 .",
    "this integral can be computed exactly to give @xmath101 that gives at small values of @xmath102 @xmath103.\\ ] ] so , remembering that @xmath104 , being @xmath105 for su(n ) in the fundamental representation , we get a linear rising potential with @xmath106 as expected .",
    "we can rewrite this as @xmath107 this result should be compared to the @xmath108 case @xcite that has @xmath109 the agreement is strikingly good in its functional form .",
    "we have shown that , in the framework of our formalism , confinement is achieved for qcd satisfying the area law from the expectation value of the wilson loop once next - to - leading order correction is accounted for .",
    "we started from the hypothesis of the existence of a trivial infrared fixed point for a yang - mills theory and this drove us to the fundamental conclusion that the scenario generally depicted by wilson and gribov is essentially correct .",
    "as an aside , it interesting to note as our approach recovers in some limit the refined gribov - zwanziger scenario confirming the existence of a @xmath110 condensate .",
    "this condensate is relevant for the existence of a mass gap in the theory .",
    "the overall agreement with lattice data and numerical studies of dyson - schwinger equations gives a serious hint that this view can represent an important track toward a full understanding of quantum field theory in the infrared limit .",

    "<S> we analyze the wilson loop for a pure yang - mills theory , using a decoupling solution in close agreement with lattice computations . at one - gluon exchange level </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the potential can not yield a linear rising contribution as expected for a confining theory . next - to - leading order correction gives rise to a quartic term for momenta in the gluon propagator that , in agreement with gribov s view , yields a linear confining term . </S>",
    "<S> this correction is due to a two - loop or sunrise integral that we need to evaluate in the low - momenta limit . in the infrared regime , the physical consistency of the theory </S>",
    "<S> is determined by a natural cut - off , arising from the integration of the classical equations of the theory , fixing in this way the regularization scheme . </S>"
