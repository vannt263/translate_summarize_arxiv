    "one of the most basic ( quantum information theoretic ) tools for studying entanglement is entropy .",
    "if a system in a pure state @xmath1 is partitioned into two subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , then their entanglement entropy , i.e. the von neumann entropy @xmath4 = - \\text{tr } \\left [ \\rho_b \\log \\rho_b \\right]\\ ] ] of either reduced density matrix @xmath5 $ ] or @xmath6 $ ] , is the unique measure of entanglement between the two subsystems .    for a real - space partition of a gapped , two - dimensional ( 2d ) system ,",
    "the leading order contribution to the entanglement entropy obeys a `` perimeter law , '' i.e. , it is proportional to the length @xmath7 of the boundary , with a non - universal coefficient @xmath8 , as @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "kitaev and preskill  @xcite and levin and wen  @xcite showed that the sub - leading , constant term of the entanglement entropy for such a system in its ground state is a universal quantity , which they called the `` topological entanglement entropy . '' in particular",
    ", the entanglement entropy ( for the ground state ) takes the form @xmath10 , up to terms that vanish in the limit @xmath9 , where @xmath11 is the number of connected components of the boundary of @xmath2 . here , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a quantity known as the `` total quantum dimension , '' which is characteristic of the system s topological order and equal to @xmath14 only for trivial topological order ( i.e. , a gapped system with no anyonic excitations )  , where @xmath15 are the quantum dimensions of the anyonic charge types that can exist in the corresponding tqft that describes the long - distance physics of the topologically ordered system",
    "it is also related to the dimension of the ground - state subspace @xmath16 for the system on a genus @xmath17 surface by @xmath18 , with @xmath19 for all @xmath17 . for a @xmath20-graded tqft ,",
    "i.e. a topological spin theory , which are relevant for the description of fermionic quantum hall states , the anyonic charges come in @xmath20 doublets ( e.g. the vacuum and the electron charges form a doublet ) , so one should use @xmath21 as the total quantum dimension of the @xmath20-graded theory , in order to count each @xmath20 anyonic charge doublet only once . ] .",
    "quantum hall systems are , so far , the most studied and only experimentally realized topologically ordered phases . most observed hall plateaus are expected to be abelian quantum hall states  @xcite with quasiparticles that have fractional charge and exchange ( braiding ) statistics  @xcite .",
    "however , some of the observed plateaus in the second landau  @xcite , most notably : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are expected to host non - abelian states  @xcite , which possess quasiparticles with non - abelian braiding statistics  @xcite .",
    "these non - abelian states have recently received much interest due to their potential application for topologically - protected fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy depends on the way the system has been partitioned . until now",
    ", two kinds of bipartite partitions have been applied to fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states : the orbital ( or momentum ) partition  @xcite , for which @xmath2 consists of the first @xmath24 orbitals ( on the sphere or torus ) while @xmath3 consists of the remaining ones and the particle partition  @xcite , for which @xmath2 consists of the first @xmath25 particles and @xmath3 consists of the @xmath26 remaining ones .",
    "a third partition , the real - space partition , for which @xmath2 is a spatial region and @xmath3 is the complement of @xmath2 , has been applied to the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) states  @xcite , which can be treated analytically .",
    "these different partitions provide access to different properties of the state . using an orbital partition as an approximation of a real - space partition ( which was argued to be a reasonable approximation , since the orbitals are gaussian localized ) , haque  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have numerically extracted the expected value @xmath27 for the @xmath28 laughlin state .",
    "however , the extraction of the topological entanglement entropy ( using the orbital partition ) in numerical studies has proven to be far less reliable for anything but the simplest model wavefunctions , in particular for the coulomb hamiltonian ground states  @xcite .    even though the topological entanglement entropy can provide significant information regarding the topological order of a system , it is not able to uniquely identify it . in ref .",
    ", kitaev and preskill provided an additional heuristic derivation of the topological entanglement entropy , in which they suggested that the reduced density matrix @xmath29 for a disk - like region @xmath2 can be used to _ define _ a hamiltonian @xmath30 which , for a topologically ordered system , would be natural to regard as the hamiltonian of a @xmath31-dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) corresponding to the edge of the system , at least for the purposes of determining the universal contribution to the entanglement entropy . in an effort to develop a more discriminating tool for identifying the topological order of a system ( particularly for non - abelian fqh states ) , li and haldane  @xcite proposed examining the ( low - lying portion of the ) spectrum of the fictitious hamiltonian @xmath32 , which they dubbed the `` entanglement spectrum '' ( es ) , versus the quantum numbers of the available symmetries in the problem .    for both the moore - read ( mr ) model state  @xcite and the ground state of the @xmath22 coulomb interaction , li and haldane  @xcite plotted the es versus @xmath33 , the quantum number of angular momentum along the @xmath34-axis for subsystem @xmath2 . for computational expediency",
    ", they used the orbital partition , assuming that , since the orbital basis states are gaussian localized , this would give a good approximation to the real - space partition .",
    "they found that the es matched the expected mr cft [ i.e. , ising x u(1 ) ] edge mode counting at the lowest pseudo - energies .",
    "given this numerical observation , they suggested ( along the lines of kitaev and preskill s statement ) that the counting of the low - lying es levels would match the cft edge mode counting for all quantum hall states ( up to some limit , which grows with the system size ) .",
    "this observation is even more remarkable if one realizes that for generic states the number of entanglement levels should saturate the hilbert space dimension , a number exponentially larger than the number of cft edge modes .",
    "renormalization group arguments supporting this conjecture have been given in ref .",
    ", whereas ref",

    "the res is expected ( from the edge cft ) to be given by a combination of the mirror modes with an additional mode propagating counter to these . in a sense , the orbital partition only probes the `` interacting '' part of the state and is not sensitive to the presence of the ( non - interacting ) integer - filled portion of a quantum hall state .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the es of quantum hall states using real - space partitions , both on the sphere and on the disk geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : rses ] , we provide the general formalism for calculating real - space partition reduced density matrices . in section  [ sec : qhs ] , we specialize the formalism to ( bosonic and fermionic ) quantum hall states . in section  [ sec : res_pes ]",
    ", we show that the res is related to the particle partition entanglement spectrum ( pes )  @xcite through a one to one map . for quantum hall states described by a cft ,",
    "i.e. , with trial wavefunctions generated by conformal blocks , this proves that the res level counting is bounded by the cft edge mode level counting .",
    "moreover , it proves that this bound is saturated in the thermodynamic limit for such states and at finite sizes for some states .",
    "we expect that the bound will also be saturated at finite sizes by all such states .",
    "( this is supported by our numerical results . ) in section  [ sec : examples ] , we numerically analyze several important examples .",
    "in particular , we analyze the @xmath0 iqh state , the @xmath28 laughlin state and its @xmath37 particle - hole conjugate state , and the @xmath0 bosonic mr state , which all have res that exhibit the structures expected from the corresponding cfts .",
    "we also analyze the res of the ground - states of realistic coulomb hamiltonians and find that they exhibit the same low - lying levels as the corresponding model states believed to describe their universality classes .",
    "the res of ground states of these hamiltonians also exhibit several other branches , besides that of the model states , in the higher es levels . in section  [ sec : higher_levels ] , we relate these higher branches to non - abelian quasielectron - quasihole excitations of the system for the case of the @xmath22 coulomb state . in section  [ sec : annulus ] , we analyze the res for the laughlin model state as we change the geometry of the manifold from the disk to the annulus to show how the edges of the sample influence the res . in section  [ sec : quasiholes ] , we analyze the res of the mr state with quasiholes .",
    "we show that , when a non - abelian quasihole crosses the partition boundary , the res exhibits a sharp change corresponding to the change of topological sectors of the cft edge mode .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : entropy ] , we compute the entanglement entropy using the spatial partition for the @xmath0 iqh state to verify the validity of the entanglement entropy perimeter law and try to extract the topological entanglement entropy . while we find the entanglement entropy scales linearly with the length of the boundary ( for long boundary length ) , but are unable to reliably compute the topological entanglement entropy even for this simple case .",
