    "liouville theory seems to be a kind of universal building block for a variety of models for two - dimensional gravity and non - trivial backgrounds in string theory .",
    "some aspects of it were important for understanding what the matrix models of 2d gravity actually describe ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and it keeps popping up in sometimes unexpected circumstances such as the the physics of membranes in string theory ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the context of string theory ,",
    "liouville theory and close relatives such as the sl(2 ) or sl(2)/u(1 ) wznw models seem to be the simplest examples where the new qualitative features of nontrivial ( possibly curved ) non - compact backgrounds can be studied .    for all this",
    "it is crucial that liouville theory , as indeed supported by many investigations of this issue , can be quantized as a _ conformal field theory _ ( cft ) , implying in particular that the space of states forms a representation of the virasoro algebra .",
    "what makes the analysis of the quantized theory much more difficult as compared to other conformal field theories is the fact that the set of virasoro representations that make up the space of states is _",
    "continuous_. this can be viewed as a reflection of the noncompactness of the space in which the liouville zero mode @xmath0 takes values .",
    "liouville theory may furthermore be seen as probably the simplest prototypical example for a class of conformal field theories called non - compact cft which have continuous spectrum of representations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "it may well be expected to play a role in the development of a general theory of such cft s that is analogous to the role of the minimal models as prototype for rational cft .",
    "this is in fact one of our main motivations : we believe that other non - compact cft will share many features with liouville theory that distinguish non - compact from rational cft .",
    "moreover , once the technical tools for the proper investigation of liouville theory are established , it should not be too difficult to generalize them to other non - compact cft .",
    "for example , many results from liouville theory can be carried over fairly directly to the @xmath1-wznw model @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the understanding of liouville theory on a ( space - time ) cylinder with circumference @xmath2 , time - coordinate @xmath3 and ( periodic ) space - coordinate @xmath4 as a two dimensional quantum field theory in its own right .",
    "( semi-)classically the theory is defined by the action @xmath5 we will attempt to describe the corresponding quantum theory that will depend on the parameter @xmath6 which we will write as @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out that there are two interesting regimes for the parameter @xmath8 that one may consider : @xmath9\\subset{{\\mathbb r}}$ ] ( `` weak coupling '' ) and @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( `` strong coupling '' ) .",
    "one aim is to construct a quantum liouville field @xmath12 that in the semi - classical limit @xmath13 corresponds to @xmath14 via the rescaling @xmath15 .",
    "this paper grew out of an attempt to write a review of liouville theory .",
    "we tried to develop a coherent picture that takes into account the different perspectives of path - integral approach , bootstrap , canonical quantization and operator approach .",
    "in doing so we felt forced to go beyond the existing literature as the listed approaches had not been sufficiently developed to allow for their mutual comparison .",
    "the character of this paper will therefore be somewhat intermediate between review , preview and original contribution : it has the character of a review in the sense that we try to exhibit the main ideas and results rather than all technical details . however , since many of the results and arguments presented here have not appeared in the literature yet , we have included short presentations of at least some key technical points .",
    "we will not try to cover liouville theory in all of its aspects and ramifications .",
    "we will _ not _ discuss important and interesting topics such as    * other boundary conditions and supersymmetric versions of liouville theory @xmath16 instead of periodic boundary conditions in the spatial direction one may also consider liouville theory on the real line @xcite , or the strip with boundary conditions that preserve conformal invariance at its end - points , see e.g. @xcite@xcite and references therein for early work , and @xcite@xcite@xcite for more recent progress . some exact results on @xmath17 liouville theory have been obtained in @xcite@xcite",
    ". it would be quite important to have similar results for @xmath18 liouville ( for some discussion see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "* liouville theory on the lattice @xmath16 early works include @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "substantial progress in this direction was made quite recently , see @xcite and references therein , but we felt unable to explain the precise connections to the material present here at the present stage of development .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to at least mention the very recent result of l. faddeev and r. kashaev @xcite , where the spectrum of the hamiltonian in the lattice liouville theory @xcite is determined on the basis of @xcite .",
    "this result nicely confirms our claim that the spectrum is purely continuous both in the weak and strong coupling regimes . * connections with teichmller theory and quantization of teichmller space @xmath16",
    "( for the former see e.g. the review @xcite , on the latter topic see e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "quantization of teichmller space is expected @xcite to encode topological information on the space of conformal blocks of liouville theory , which should be equivalent ( see @xcite for strong evidence ) to the description of the duality transformations on spaces of conformal blocks that was proposed in @xcite and which will be discussed in part [ boots ] . * non - unitary spectra , `` elliptic sector '' there exist proposals for versions of quantum liouville theory that have spectra involving non - unitary representations of the virasoro algebra , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "related to the lack of unitarity one finds unusual hermiticity properties of the exponential field operators . in the present paper",
    "we will be exclusively concerned with the possibility of having a quantization of liouville theory that preserves unitarity .",
    "* closed discrete sub - algebras of the algebra of vertex operators that create unitary representations @xmath16 it was proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite@xcite ) that for certain special values of the parameter @xmath8 spectrum and vertex operator algebra of liouville theory admit a `` unitary truncation '' in the following sense : there exists a hilbert space @xmath19 spanned by a discrete set of unitary representations of the virasoro algebra , equipped with a realization of a discrete family of local vertex operators with real positive conformal dimensions .",
    "this would allow to construct non - critical bosonic string models .",
    "let us remark , however , that our discussion _ will _ apply to the values of @xmath8 , for which the proposal of @xcite was made .",
    "nevertheless , it could be that the operator algebra that we discuss here shows some kind of `` reducibility '' for certain values of @xmath8 , which would lead to the proposal of @xcite @xmath16 see also our remark in part [ boots ] , subsection [ strc_rem ] .",
    "* applications to models of 2d gravity @xmath16 ( see e.g. @xcite )    the author will be grateful to anybody pointing out further omissions or missing references concerning the material that is covered in the present paper .",
    "if a conformal field theory fits into the framework introduced in @xcite , it is essentially fully characterized by its spectrum of primary fields and the full set of three point functions .",
    "what we will call the `` dozz - proposal '' ( where dozz stands for dorn , otto , al .",
    "and a. zamolodchikov ) amounts to the proposal that liouville theory fits into the framework of @xcite , together with an explicit formula for the three point functions of the primary fields @xcite@xcite .    and indeed , as we will discuss in more detail",
    ", one can show that essentially all of liouville theory is encoded in these pieces of information : thanks to conformal symmetry it is possible to reconstruct all correlation functions of primary fields from the three - point function by summing over intermediate states .",
    "primary fields and the energy momentum tensor generate the operator algebra of the theory .",
    "mixed correlation functions involving the energy momentum tensor together with primary fields are reduced to correlation functions of only primary fields by the conformal ward identities .    from that point of view",
    "the main problem for establishing the validity of the dozz - proposal is to show crossing symmetry of the amplitudes that can be reconstructed by means of conformal symmetry in terms of the particular formula for the three point functions that was proposed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "once this is established , one has ample reason to view the theory that is characterized by the dozz - proposal as a quantization of classical liouville theory : let us only mention that the semi - classical limit of the formula proposed in @xcite@xcite indeed matches the result of direct semi - classical calculations @xcite .    in the present paper we will try to explain why the dozz - proposal works and what the resulting picture of the physics of quantum liouville theory looks like .",
    "in part [ pathint ] we begin by formulating more precisely what we refer to as the `` dozz - proposal '' . afterwards",
    "some of the original motivation for that proposal will be discussed which came from the path - integral approach to liouville theory as initiated in @xcite .",
    "our main objective in that part [ pathint ] is to explain how liouville theory can be reconstructed on the basis of the dozz - proposal : how to reconstruct the hilbert space , operators corresponding to the fields , their correlation functions etc .. some features arise that are unfamiliar from rational conformal field theories : for example , one does not find the @xmath20-invariant state @xmath21 in the spectrum .",
    "however , it will be shown that a distributional interpretation of the `` state '' @xmath21 is not only natural in a theory with continuous spectrum , but also makes operator - state correspondence and the interpretation of correlation functions as `` vacuum expectation values '' work in much the same way as in rational conformal field theories .",
    "the following part [ canq1 ] discusses some aspects of the quantum liouville physics as encoded in the dozz - proposal .",
    "we begin by discussing to what extend the dozz - proposal can be shown to represent a canonical quantization of liouville theory : it is possible to reconstruct a field @xmath12 that weakly ( within matrix elements ) satisfies the canonical commutation relations and a natural quantum version of the liouville equation of motion .",
    "one might then hope to have a representation where the liouville zero mode @xmath22 is diagonal , so that one could describe the physics of liouville theory in terms of wave - functions @xmath23 on `` target - space '' . and",
    "indeed , such a representation would allow one to get natural interpretations for many features of the dozz - proposal in terms of scattering off the liouville potential .",
    "however , at present we only have good control over such a representation in the region corresponding to zero mode @xmath24 , the `` asymptotic boundary of target space '' where the liouville interaction vanishes .",
    "this is good enough for setting up the scattering picture that we had mentioned above .",
    "but it is not clear so far how to describe liouville physics for finite values of @xmath22 , in the `` bulk of target space '' .",
    "it is not even clear whether such a representation with diagonal zero mode @xmath22 exists at all : the zero mode operator @xmath22 has a rather complicated description in a representation where the hamiltonian is diagonal , making it difficult to control properties such as self - adjointness .",
    "our third part is devoted to the operator approach to liouville theory .",
    "classically , one has a canonical transformation from free field theory to the interacting liouville theory . in the operator approach one",
    "tries to quantize this transformation , i.e. to construct liouville field operators in terms of the quantized free field .",
    "we outline recent results that lead to a complete construction of general exponential liouville fields within such a framework ( more details will be given in a forthcoming publication ) .",
    "their matrix elements are given by the three point function proposed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "this construction is based on the construction of a class of covariant chiral operators that form the building blocks of the exponential fields .",
    "locality of the exponential fields can be controlled thanks to the existence of exchange- ( braid- ) relations that are satisfied by the covariant chiral operators .",
    "these results form the technical core for the construction of liouville theory that we propose .",
    "conceptually it is interesting to compare this approach with the discussion in part [ canq1 ] : this furnishes another interpretation for the reflection operator @xmath25 that describes the scattering of wave - packets off the liouville - potential `` wall '' : classically one finds that the map from the free field to the liouville field is two - to - one .",
    "this ambiguity is expressed in the quantum theory by the existence of an operator @xmath26 that commutes with the liouville field operators .",
    "the operator @xmath26 coincides precisely with the reflection operator @xmath25 .",
    "this observation may lead one to identify the free field theory on which the operator approach is based with the free field theory that describes the asymptotic in- and out - states of the scattering off the liouville potential .",
    "alternatively , one may view the operator approach as providing a reconstruction of liouville theory from the free field theory `` living on the asymptotic boundary of target space '' .",
    "we finally discuss in part [ boots ] how liouville theory fits into a `` chiral bootstrap '' framework such as the one introduced for rational conformal field theories in @xcite@xcite .",
    "this not only yields insight into the mathematics behind the consistency of liouville theory ( fusion of unitary virasoro representations , relation to quantum group representation theory ) , but also provides a useful framework to complete the verification of locality and crossing symmetry for the exponential liouville fields constructed in part [ gervnev ] .      throughout we will use the convention that for a local field @xmath27",
    ", the notation @xmath28 denotes the euclidean field on the riemann sphere , @xmath29 or @xmath30 , @xmath31 its counterpart on the euclidean cylinder , @xmath32 the minkowskian version , and @xmath33 .",
    "[ pathint ]    we will start by discussing what we call the dozz - proposal . in a nutshell it consists of two ingredients : ( i )",
    "liouville theory fits into a rather mild generalization of the bpz - formalism for two - dimensional conformal field theories , and ( ii ) a proposal for an explicit representation of the three point function ( `` dozz - formula '' ) .",
    "the dozz - proposal will be formulated more more explicitly in the next section .",
    "afterwards we will present some motivation for the dozz - formula from the path - integral point of view . in the remainder of this part",
    "we will try to explain how really all of liouville theory is encoded in these two pieces of information .",
    "within a formalism for conformal field theories such as that introduced in @xcite one assumes liouville theory to be fully characterized by the set of all vacuum expectation values of the form @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the holomorphic and antiholomorphic components of the energy - momentum tensor respectively , and the @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the primary fields . the vacuum expectation values ( [ vev ] ) are assumed to satisfy the following conditions :    1 .",

    "let us anticipate the following relations between the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath50 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 : @xmath51    let us remember two simple consequences of these assumptions : first , the conformal ward identities can be read as a rule that allows to recursively express general vacuum expectation values ( [ vev ] ) in terms of those which contain only the field @xmath47 .",
    "second , the property of global @xmath20-invariance allows one to determine part of the dependence of the vacuum expectation values on the variables @xmath52 , in particular for @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 if @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61",

    "clearly @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a verma - module over the virasoro algebra ( see section [ verma ] for a summary of some relevant results on the representation theory of the virasoro algebra ) .",

    "the checks performed in @xcite include comparison with semiclassical calculations in two different limiting regimes , comparison with results from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz for the sinh - gordon model ( which is related to liouville theory in the ultraviolet limit ) , as well as a numerical check of crossing symmetry for the four - point functions constructed from the three point functions via factorization .",
    "the expression ( [ zzform ] ) has ( at least ) one amazing feature : it is left invariant if one replaces @xmath172 and furthermore @xmath173 remembering that @xmath174 was playing the role of a coupling constant or alternatively the role of @xmath6 , this indicates a rather remarkable and profound self - duality of liouville theory .",

    "the unit field should clearly have vanishing conformal dimension @xmath238 . under the restriction ( [ seibd ] ) this is only found for @xmath239 which lies on the boundary of our `` allowed '' region @xmath234 .",
