    "it is known@xcite that the conductivity of doped manganites increases dramatically at the transition from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic state . in the la@xmath4ca@xmath5mno@xmath6 system with doping levels in the range @xmath7",
    "this transition occurs simultaneously with an insulator - metal transition .",
    "if the manganite samples have fairly good crystalline order , huge temperature changes in light absorption and magneto - absorption can occur at the transition to the metallic ferromagnetic state . these effects open the possibility for use of doped manganites not only as magnetic recording media , but also for developing various optoelectronics devices controlled by magnetic or thermal fields@xcite .",
    "previously large temperature changes in light absorption and magneto - absorption near the curie temperature , @xmath8 , have been found in single - crystal ( la@xmath4pr@xmath9)@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath6 films ( @xmath12  k ) @xcite and single crystal la@xmath13sr@xmath14mno@xmath6 ( @xmath15  k ) @xcite .",
    "this work reports similar effects in polycrystalline la@xmath0ca@xmath1 mno@xmath6 films with a higher @xmath8 , which is only moderately less than room temperature .",
    "this may be important in practical use of these effects .",
    "this study will also address correlations of other material properties ( the structural , transport and magnetic properties ) with the optical measurements for this system .",
    "the la@xmath4ca@xmath5 mno@xmath6 ( @xmath16 ) film described in this paper was grown by pulsed - laser deposition ( pld ) on a ( 001 ) oriented laalo@xmath6 substrate . a pld system from neocera inc . with a lambda physik krf excimer laser operating at 248",
    "nm was used to ablate the target material with a nominal composition la@xmath17ca@xmath18mno@xmath2 .",
    "the target was prepared by solid - state reaction starting from high purity powders of la@xmath19o@xmath6 , caco@xmath6 and mnco@xmath6 .",
    "the lattice parameter for the target indexed for a pseudo - cubic unit cell is found to be @xmath20  nm .",
    "the film ( about 150 nm thick ) was ablated at a substrate temperature of 600@xmath21c in an oxygen atmosphere at pressure @xmath22  mtorr . during deposition",
    "the pulse energy was 584 mj with a repetition rate of 8 hz .",
    "the target - substrate distance was about 7 cm .",
    "time of deposition was about 31  min .",
    "after deposition the film was cooled to room temperature in the same oxygen atmosphere .",
    "the film was post - annealed in flowing oxygen for 25 hours at 950@xmath21c .",
    "the film characterization and measurements were done using a variety of experimental techniques .",
    "a standard @xmath23 scan was used for the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) study of the film .",
    "the xrd patterns were obtained using a rigaku model d - max - b diffractometer with a graphite monochromator and cu - k@xmath24 radiation .",
    "the ac susceptibility and dc magnetization were measured in a lake shore model 7229 ac susceptometer / dc magnetometer .",
    "resistance as a function of temperature and magnetic field was measured using a standard four - point probe technique in magnetic fields up to 5 t.    optical absorption spectra and temperature dependences of the intensity of the transmitted light ( transmission ) were investigated in the energy range 0.121.0 ev , the temperature range 80 - 295 k and in magnetic fields up to 0.8 t. the constant magnetic field was applied along the direction of light propagation perpendicular to the plane of the film .",
    "the magneto - optical ( mo ) properties of the film were studied by measurements of the linear transverse kerr effect ( tke ) .",
    "the tke was investigated in the energy range 0.53.8 ev , the temperature range 10300 k and in magnetic fields 0.3 t. a dynamic method to record tke was used .",
    "the relative change in the intensity of the reflected light @xmath25/i(0)$ ] , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the intensities of the reflected light in the presence and in absence of a magnetic field respectfully , was directly measured in the experiment .",
    "other details of the technique used were described previously@xcite .",
    "a @xmath23 scan permits determination of the lattice parameters in the direction perpendicular to the film plane . in the xrd pattern ( fig .",
    "1 ) only the ( 001 ) , ( 002 ) , ( 003 ) and ( 004 ) reflections from both the substrate and the film are found , indicating a high degree out - of - plane orientation of the film . the xrd pattern for the substrate corresponds to single - crystal laalo@xmath6 . at fairly high angles the peaks for the substrate are split ( having doublets ) , due to contribution of the k@xmath28 and k@xmath29 radiation .",
    "the less intense film peaks are not split .",
    "the lattice parameter for the substrate is found to be @xmath30  nm . this agrees well with the expected value @xmath31  nm for single - crystal laalo@xmath6@xcite .",
    "the out - of - plane lattice parameter for the film is equal to @xmath32  nm which is a little less than that of the target .",
    "the surface of the film appears bright and specular .",
    "other films having the same structural , magnetic and transport properties were prepared in the same pld run .",
    "the rms roughness of one of these films was determined to be less than 2 nm in an atomic force microscope .",
    "the film studied here is expected to have has the same high surface smoothness .",
    "the temperature dependence of the real ( @xmath33 ) and the imaginary ( @xmath34 ) components of the ac susceptibility are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in the same figure the temperature dependence of the magnetization is presented .",
    "the latter is rather noisy due to the small mass of the film .",
    "nonetheless , it is evident from fig .",
    "2 that the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition is quite sharp . from these temperature dependences",
    "the curie temperature , @xmath8 , can be obtained .",
    "the value of @xmath35  k , is found if @xmath8 is defined as the temperature of the inflection point in the @xmath36 curve .",
    "it is expected also that @xmath37 should peak at @xmath8@xcite .",
    "this temperature is about 273.3  k , which is very close to the @xmath8 value found from the @xmath36 curve .",
    "the temperature dependence of the film resistivity and of the magneto - resistance ( mr ) are shown in figs . 3 and 4 . as evident from fig .",
    "3 , the resistive transition which accompanies the magnetic one is also sharp ( see also the temperature behavior of the temperature coefficient of resistance ( tcr ) shown in the insert to this figure ) . in general , the observed @xmath38 behavior ( as well as the @xmath36 curve ) reflects the high - quality of the film studied .",
    "the temperature , @xmath39  k , where resistance peaks , is very close to @xmath8 , as expected for high quality films@xcite .",
    "the ratio of resistances at @xmath40 and 4.2 k , @xmath41 , is extremely high ( about 48.6 ) .",
    "this large variation of resistance with temperature is attributed mainly to the strengthening of the magnetic order with decreasing temperature .",
    "the resistivity at @xmath42  k is about 0.9 @xmath43  m which is one of the lowest values reported for la@xmath4ca@xmath5 mno@xmath6 ( @xmath16 ) films ( e.g. , compared with those in ref . ) . as a measure of the mr @xmath44/r(0)$ ]",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "4 . the mr has a sharp maximum ( with an absolute value of 0.65 at @xmath45  t ) at @xmath46  k , that is actually at @xmath47 . nearly identical and high values of @xmath8 , @xmath40 and @xmath48 found in this study",
    "provide evidence of the high quality of this highly oriented film .      the spectral dependence of tke for the film studied ( fig .",
    "5a ) is consistent with previous data for doped manganites with similar doping level @xcite .",
    "there is a large `` negative peak '' at @xmath49  ev together with an additional feature near @xmath50  ev . at @xmath51",
    "k , the peak amplitude near @xmath52 ev is about @xmath53 . the temperature dependence of tke ( fig .",
    "5b ) was measured at two incident photon energies ( 1.8  ev and 2.8 ev ) , corresponding to the peak positions in tke spectra ( fig .",
    "5a ) . these temperature dependences should reflect that of the magnetization .",
    "indeed , the temperature at which an appreciable kerr effect can be seen , when going from high to lower temperature , is close to the @xmath8 values obtained from the magnetic and resistance measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature dependence curves for tke recorded at different photon energies , are quite different from each other .",
    "it can be seen that temperature dependence of tke , measured at @xmath54  ev , looks quite similar to the m(t ) dependence ( fig .",
    "both curves reveal a sharp increase in magnetization near @xmath8 , but that for @xmath55  ev , shows a far slower increase in the tke signal with decreasing temperature below @xmath8 . this effect is most likely associated with the shifting of the peak to lower energy ( `` red '' region ) with increasing temperature ( fig .",
    "5a ) ; whereas the peak at @xmath54  ev is not shifted for a wide temperature range .",
    "the mechanism of this difference in temperature behavior of the spectral peaks is not clear at present .",
    "it is conceivable that this is connected with the different nature of optical transitions responsible for magneto - optical activity in these energy regions .",
    "as was shown earlier @xcite , in the spectral range under study there is an allowed electric - dipole transition in the octahedral complex ( mno@xmath56 at @xmath57  ev and spin - resolved @xmath58 transition in mn@xmath59 and mn@xmath60 at lower energies .",
    "that is , a large magneto - optical effect in the neighborhood of @xmath61  ev is caused by a charge - transfer transition with an involvement of both mn and o ions .",
    "the temperature dependence of this transition should be more complex than that for mn ions , as is actually observed in this study .",
    "further studies are necessary , of course , to clarify this effect . in general",
    ", the tke data obtained correlate well with the results of magnetic and transport measurements and support arguments that this film is of excellent quality and homogeneity .",
    "let us turn now to the optical properties of the film .",
    "an absorption spectrum for the film in the paramagnetic state at @xmath62  k is presented in fig .",
    "6 . it can be seen that an increase in wavelength , @xmath63 , leads to a decrease in absorption , that can be associated with the influence of `` tails '' of inter - band optical transitions . for a large enough increase in wavelength ,",
    "the absorption begins to increase .",
    "this is determined by the presence of the impurity band , which is usually positioned around @xmath64  @xmath65 m ( @xmath66  ev ) for manganites and associated with mn@xmath60 ions @xcite . below @xmath8 a strong increase in absorption has been observed .",
    "this is connected with the light absorption by free charge carriers .",
    "this phenomena is demonstrated more clearly by the temperature dependence of intensity of light transmitted through the film at a wavelength @xmath67  @xmath65 m ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "the light intensity is sharply reduced below 270 k in a narrow temperature range ( fig .",
    "the giant change in the intensity is more than a 1000-fold decrease .",
    "the magnetic field shifts the intensity curve @xmath68 to higher temperature . the relative change of transmission under the influence of the magnetic field [ magneto - transmittance ( mt ) ] , @xmath69/i_{0}$ ] , peaks at 28 % in a field of 0.8 t at @xmath70  k ( see insert in fig .",
    "the magneto - transmittance is found to be significant for the film studied in the temperature range 250 - 280 k. that can be important for possible applications . in previous works @xcite",
    "this effect was observed at significantly lower temperatures ( @xmath71  k ) .",
    "it must be emphasized as well that the effect is seen in unpolarized light .",
    "it is quite clear that the giant decrease in transmission found below @xmath8 in this study is determined by the transition of the film to the metallic state with fairly high density of free ( or quasi - free ) charge carriers . in spite of extensive experimental and theoretical efforts , a clear understanding of the metal - insulator transition in doped manganites and",
    "the colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) associated with it is not yet available .",
    "several possible explanations can be found in review papers @xcite .",
    "one of the possible reasons for cmr in homogeneous samples is the shift of the mobility edge induced by a change in temperature or magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , it is hard to expect a sufficiently high homogeneity in doped manganites @xcite .",
    "one of the certain things is that a clear correlation exists between transport properties and magnetization in the mixed - valence manganites @xcite .",
    "namely , the resistance @xmath72 of manganites in the ferromagnetic state is a function of magnetization and the conductivity increases with enhancement of ferromagnetic order .",
    "this , together with the large drop of resistivity and light transmission below @xmath8 , is the source of the huge negative mr and mt in manganites .",
    "the sharp drop in resistance below @xmath8 in doped manganites can be used for bolometric applications @xcite .",
    "actually , the tcr of the film studied is fairly high in the temperature range close to room temperature ( see insert in fig .",
    "it has been shown here , however , that changes in the transmission at the magnetic transition are much larger .",
    "indeed , the ratio of resistances at @xmath40 and 4.2 k , @xmath41 , was found to be very high ( about 48.6 ) , but the optical transmission exhibits a far larger drop ( more than a 1000-fold decrease ) below @xmath8 .",
    "the transmission , @xmath73 , of films is defined as the ratio between intensities of transmitted and incident light . for a film with high absorption , when @xmath74  % , the transmission is related to the absorption coefficient , @xmath75 , by the equation @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is film thickness , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 are reflection coefficients at the boundaries of film - substrate , substrate - vacuum , film - vacuum , respectfully .",
    "the absorption coefficient is proportional to the dc conductivity ( drude model ) .",
    "it is evident from the foregoing equation that there is no direct proportionality between the transmission and the resistivity , but the temperature dependence of the transmission reflects the @xmath38 behavior .",
    "the change in intensity of the transmitted light through the sample at the transition to the ferromagnetic state is of particular interest for practical use .",
    "this change is large for the film studied in comparison with the moderate change in the absorption coefficient .",
    "( it can be shown that a 1000-fold decrease in the transmission corresponds to an increase in the absorption coefficient by a factor of 5.6 , not taking into account the change in reflectivity . )",
    "the decrease in skin depth , @xmath81 , at @xmath82  k is responsible for the non - transparency of the film in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "this can be estimated with the expression @xmath83 under the assumption that the magnetic permeability is equal to unity to obtain @xmath84  nm at @xmath42  k , and @xmath85  nm at @xmath86 for light with @xmath87  @xmath65 m .",
    "that is , the skin depth is far larger than the film thickness ( @xmath88  nm ) in the paramagnetic state , but in the ferromagnetic state it is significantly less than the film thickness .",
    "it should be added that the relative change of the intensity of transmitted light in a magnetic field , mt = @xmath89/i_{0}$ ] , is certain to be a direct analogue of mr = ( @xmath90/r(0)$ ] ) . as in the case of mr",
    ", this quantity mt is determined by the ability of an external magnetic field to enhance the magnetic order in the doped manganites .",
    "the high - temperature optical phenomena of magneto - transmittance and the strong temperature dependence of magneto - transmittance near @xmath8 that has been reported here can be used for development of a number of ir optoelectronic devices , such as light modulators , optical attenuators , light shutters , temperature and magnetic - field indicators , etc .",
    "these devices can work in the ir range with @xmath63 up to 14 @xmath65 m .",
    "as far as we know , the number of materials , which can be used in this energy range as optical control devices , is very limited .",
    "high quality and high homogeneity doped manganite films which exhibit a sharp magnetic transition and high conductivity in the ferromagnetic state should be very useful in development of appropriate optical devices .    in conclusion , at a temperature ( @xmath91  k ) not far from room temperature giant temperature changes in light transmittance and large magneto - transmittance has been observed .",
    "these effects can be used for ir optoelectronics devices .",
