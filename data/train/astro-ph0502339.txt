    "what motivates our theoretical attempts to model the seds of galaxies ? put another way , what do we hope to learn from such an exercise ?",
    "firstly , we should recall that the bolometric luminosity of a starburst galaxy is dominated by the young stars it contains .",
    "thus regardless of how much or how little of this luminosity is reprocessed through the dusty interstellar medium either through thermal emission in the ir of dust grains , through fluorescent processes or through heating and re - emission in an ionized medium , the pan - spectral sed tells us what the star formation rate currently is , or has been in the recent past .",
    "the first objective of pan - spectral sed modelling is therefore to be able to reliably infer star formation rates in galaxies and to provide likely error estimates using observational data sets which may in practice be restricted to only certain emission lines or spectral features .",
    "the importance of being able to reliably measure star formation can not be under - estimated , since the star formation history of the universe is a fundamental indicator of galaxy evolution .",
    "the famous lilly - madau plot @xcite provides this quantity on a global scale .",
    "this plot shows the star formation rate ( in solar masses per year ) per ( cosmology corrected ) co - moving volume ( mpc@xmath0 ) vs. the redshift , @xmath1 .",
    "as shown notably by ascasibar et  al.@xcite , an unacceptable scatter attaches not only to the observational estimates , and also to theoretical estimates based on the @xmath2cdm cosmology . for the observational data , much of this scatter results from uncertain corrections for the absorption by dust , and from the application of different methods with different observational biases and uncertainties . for the theoretical curves the uncertainties are mostly due to cosmic variance , the choice of the `` prescription '' of star formation which has been adopted , and to the treatment of feedback between the star formation and the interstellar medium .    beyond the global picture of the star formation history of",
    "the universe provided by the madau plot , there is increasing interest in deriving the star formation rates of individual galaxies at high redshift to determine how galaxies were assembled as a function of environment and of time . at high redshift , massive dusty protogalaxies",
    "have been observed to be forming stars at many thousands of solar masses per year @xcite .",
    "if continued , such bursts would convert all the galactic gas into stars in roughly a dynamical timescale ; @xmath3 years .",
    "by contrast , there is increasing evidence that the lyman break galaxies represent a more moderate ( and probably much less massive ) class of object with , in many cases , little dust obscuration and star formation rates @xmath4yr@xmath5 . in order to interpret the seds of such distant objects , we first need to understand how the form of the sed is controlled by the interstellar physics and the geometry of the stars with respect to the gas . to do this",
    ", we would be best advised to first study and model nearby star - bursting objects such as arp  220 in which we can better resolve the structure of a starburst region , and for which we frequently have much better quality data over more wavebands than we have for most high - redshift objects .",
    "once understood , such objects can then be used to gain physical insight into these more distant sources    such theoretical studies of nearby objects provide the second motivation for sed modelling ; to gain insights into the physical parameters of starburst galaxies , such as the stellar populations , the atomic and molecular gas content , the star and gas - phase metallicities , the physical parameters such as pressure or mean density of their interstellar media , and the nature of the interstellar dust , its composition and spatial distribution .",
    "these physical parameters then drive insight into the physical processes which control them .",
    "these include as supernova processing , shock - induced star formation , dust grain processing , synchrotron losses as well as many others .",
    "almost any feature in the sed of a starburst galaxy could , in principle , be used as a star formation rate ( sfr ) indicator , provided the appropriate bolometric correction can be worked out . in many cases , however , this is by no means a trivial exercise .",
    "here we briefly discuss some of the more commonly - used techniques to determine the sfr in galaxies .",
    "others exist ( for example , the x - ray flux ) , but these are not yet sufficiently well understood from a theoretical point of view to warrant inclusion here .",

    "however , star formation rates derived in this way most frequently assume that the dust is effectively acting as a re - processing bolometer wrapped around the star forming region , and that cool and old stars do not provide too much of a contribution .    in any real galaxy ,",
    "old stars exist , and the stars are neither unobscured by dust , and nor are they totally obscured @xcite .",
    "this degree of obscuration is one of the many `` geometrical '' factors which render the derivation of the absolute sfr quite uncertain .",
    "for example , @xcite includes a number of these geometrical factors in the following formula for the ir luminosity of a galaxy :    @xmath7    this allows a fraction , @xmath8 , of the ionizing flux to be absorbed by dust in the hii  region , assuming that all of the lyman-@xmath9 photons are multiply scattered by the gas and ultimately absorbed by dust in the surrounding hi  region , that a fraction , @xmath10 , of the non - ionizing uv photons are absorbed , and that a fraction @xmath11 of the radiation field produced by the old stars is also absorbed by dust .",
    "photoionization models of hii  regions show that , typically , the lyman-@xmath9 flux is of order 30% of the total stellar flux absorbed by the nebula , so that globally , the dust is fairly efficient in capturing and re - radiating the flux originally radiated by the star in the lyman continuum .    the dust obscuration is observed to increase both with galaxian mass @xcite , and with the absolute rate star formation @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as the combination of the degree of chemical evolution of the interstellar medium , which leads to a low dust to gas ratio in dwarf galaxies , and of the operation of the schmidt law @xcite of star formation , which couples the star formation rate per unit area to the gas surface density , and therefore , for a given dust to gas ratio , to the dust obscuration , provided that the surface rate of star formation is coupled to the global rate of star formation , which appears to be most often the case .",

    "observationally , there is an extraordinarily close correlation between the 60@xmath14 m infrared continuum and the radio 1.4  ghz continuum of star forming galaxies .",
    "this linear correlation spans @xmath15 decades of magnitude with less than 0.3  dex dispersion @xcite .",
    "the mean relationship between the 60@xmath14 m flux and the 1.4  ghz continuum is :    @xmath16=10^{12}\\left[{l_{\\rm 60\\mu m } } / { l_\\odot}\\right ] \\label{radir}\\ ] ]    in star forming galaxies at 1.4  ghz , the non - thermal emission by relativistic electrons dominates by at least an order of magnitude over the free - free emission @xcite . therefore , and somewhat remarkably , this relationship couples a purely thermal process with a non - thermal process , over many decades of flux , and locally , within individual galaxies .    if the lifetime of the synchrotron electrons is short compared with the evolution timescale of the starburst , then as @xcite have shown , the synchrotron emissivity acts as a bolometer of the supernova rate .",
    "this works because the relativistic luminosity is ultimately derived from the fermi acceleration process in supernova shocks , which for constant efficiency should be proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "specifically , the non - thermal luminosity is given by :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the total star formation rate .",
    "since the observed spectral index lies in the range , @xmath19 , there is only a very weak dependence on the magnetic field in this case . to the extent that the fir luminosity is providing a bolometric indication of the sfr",
    ", this seems to provide the most natural explanation of the fir : radio correlation in starburst galaxies .",
    "this will be especially true when the pressure in the interstellar medium is high , since provided that the magnetic pressure is in equipartition with the gas pressure , the synchrotron losses are strongly encouraged by the high interstellar magnetic field .

    "this problem can be avoided by observing at infrared wavelengths , in br@xmath23 for example .",
    "a further complication is that the dust content of the nebula is metallicity - dependent , and therefore an appreciable fraction of the hydrogen ionizing photons may be absorbed by dust in high metallicity hii  regions .",
    "this possibility , first seriously quantified by @xcite , has been discussed by a number of authors since and its effect has been investigated and quantified ( as far as is possible by direct observation ) in a series of recent papers by inoue and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "dopita @xcite has shown that this effect increases in importance in the more compact hii  regions , and may lead to errors as high as @xmath24% in estimates of the global sfr .",
    "indeed , in ultra - compact hii  regions , as much as @xmath25% of the ionising photons may be lost to dust in the ionized nebula . however , the magnitude of this effect is a function of the product of the metallicity , @xmath26 and the dimensionless ionization parameter , @xmath27 , both of which can in principle be determined by emission line diagnostics .

    "photoionization models show that these are by no means ideal as star formation indicators , because their strength not only depends on the attenuation , which tends to be large in the uv , but also on the metallicity of the ionized gas .",

    "it is better to take the approach pioneered by dwek , and use the constraints offered by the uv attenuation by the dust simultaneously with fitting the far - ir peak .",

    "the life - cycle of dust grains in the interstellar medium must , in large measure , represent a balance between grain destruction and shattering in the fast shocks found in the hot and warm phases of the ism , and the processes which build up grains in the dense molecular clouds .",

    "can be inferred by a measurement of elemental depletions in the interstellar medium .",

    "these are simplified here .",
    "let @xmath39 be the mass of a particular grain - forming element in the ism , and suppose a fraction @xmath40 of this element is locked up into dust in the interstellar medium . in the hot phase , the evolution of @xmath40 will depend on the characteristic timescale needed to destroy the grains in the ( warm ) low - density phase through supernova explosions , @xmath41 , the timescale needed to regenerate the dust in the cold dense phase@xmath42 , and the time taken to transport the dust from the ( cold ) dense to the ( hotter ) less - dense phase , @xmath43 .",
    "assuming that the growth time of dust grains in the cold phase is very short compared with the timescale of mass transport between the cold and warm phases ( or its inverse ) , the dynamical evolution of the dust mass in the hot phase is : @xmath44 and in equilibrium ; @xmath45 in other words , the difference in the dust fractions between the two phases depends simply on the relative size of the reservoir of dust in the cold phase and ratio of the time taken for the dust to escape into the hot phase to the time taken to destroy it in the hot phase .",
    "now , what determines the timescale of destruction @xmath41 ?",
    "this is the mean interval between the passage of fast shocks which result in sputtering of grains or in the destruction of pah molecules .",

    "the sputtering lifetime for average size grains ( @xmath55 is of order 10@xmath56  years in fast shocks .",
    "this is comfortably shorter than the grain braking timescale , so that only the very largest grains can survive .",
    "depending on the magnetic field configuration , grains start to be destroyed ( rather than simply shattered ) in shocks faster than 100 , and the process is complete by @xmath57 .",
    "how often do shocks this fast pass through the warm phase of the interstellar medium ?",
    "we can estimate this by asking at what size and shock velocity do supernova remnants become dominated by cooling , after which they rapidly slow down .",
    "the end of the adiabatic ( sedov - taylor ) phase is signalled by the cooling timescale in the shell becoming less than the dynamical expansion timescale ; @xmath58.the cooling timescale in a strong shock can be approximated @xcite by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the shock velocity , @xmath61 , in units of 100 , the chemical abundance @xmath26 is with respect to solar , and the pre - shock density is @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "the sedov taylor solution for the snr expansion gives : @xmath64 were @xmath65 is the kinetic energy of the explosion in units of @xmath66 ergs .",
    "therefore , we can infer that the snr becomes radiative when : @xmath67 this is interestingly close to the velocity at which sputtering and grain destruction is complete .",
    "the radius at which this condition is met is found by noting that @xmath68 and using this to eliminate time in the sedov equation for the radius : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the radius in units of 10pc .",
    "thus , from eqns . [ rad ] and [ sed ] we have that the snr becomes radiative when : @xmath71 in a disk - like galaxy , the gas with surface density @xmath72 @xmath73pc@xmath74 is confined within twice the scale height , @xmath75 .",
    "the surface rate of supernova events is proportional to the surface rate of star formation , @xmath76 , and the observational schmidt law @xcite gives @xmath77 .",
    "these relationships appear to hold in the case of starburst galaxies as well .",
    "thus the timescale for the gas to be processed through a supernova shock is : @xmath78 because , in a self - gravitating layer , the scale height is set by the velocity dispersion of the disk gas in the vertical plane , @xmath79 , giving @xmath80 , and in disk galaxies the observed hi  vertical velocity dispersion is observed to be almost constant at between 7 and 10 @xcite . in disk galaxies , as @xmath81 decreases with increasing radius , so does @xmath26 , and therefore the two terms in eqn .",
    "[ tauproc ] almost cancel each other , giving the final result that @xmath82    the fact that the sn processing timescale is virtually constant is a remarkable and perhaps even a counter - intuitive result .",
    "it may be giving us a profound clue about the process of self - regulation of star formation in galaxies .",
    "since the supernovae act to turbulently stir the ism , and since the ism density structure is thought to originate from the turbulent cascade of energy from large scales to small scales , and since this turbulent cascade is thought to set up the conditions for new star formation , then the schmidt law itself may simply be the expression of this turbulent cascade process with constant @xmath83 .",
    "return now to the effect that this has on the grain population .",
    "it is clear from equation [ grain eq . ]",
    "that , if the snr rate is also determining the timescale of large - scale mixing , and therefore the mass - exchange rate between the various phases , the ratio of the two timescales may not change much with environment .",

    ". models with warmer far - ir colors will have a more compact disposition of gas with respect to the stars .",
    "the difficulty here is that , in any starburst model , these geometrical relationships are not determined _ a priori_.    in the semi - empirical modelling of dale and his collaborators ( @xcite , and this conference ) , the sed of disk and starburst galaxies were suggested to form a one - parameter family in dust temperature .",
    "this suggested that starburst galaxies have hotter dust temperatures .",
    "lagache et al @xcite ( again empirically ) have suggested that the luminosity controls the form of the sed .",
    "both of these may be true to some extent , since ir luminous galaxies have greater rates of star formation .",
    "the french group @xcite take the simplest approach of approximating the starburst by a spherical hii  region and clumpy dust shell around the central star forming region .",
    "a more sophisticated approach is taken in the grazil code by the padova / trieste group @xcite .",
    "their starburst model uses a spherical geometry with king profiles , and they allow for the formation of clusters of stars in molecular complexes , and their subsequent escape from these regions .    in the rather sophisticated models of takagi",
    "et al @xcite , a mass - radius relationship for the star formation region of @xmath89 is adopted along with a stellar density distribution given by a generalised king profile .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 is a compactness parameter which expresses the degree of matter concentration , and is related to the optical depth of the dust through which the starburst region is seen . for a sample of ultra - luminous starbursts , they find that , while most conform to a constant surface brightness of order @xmath91kpc@xmath74 , there are a few objects with surface brightnesses roughly ten times larger than this , which they ascribe to post - merger systems .    in a starburst , the individual stars form in clusters at the cores of dense molecular complexes , and initially the geometry of the gas with respect to the dust",
    "is determined by the evolution of the mass loss bubble / hii  region around individual clusters .",
    "it is only at later times that these bubbles may link up to create a large - scale hii  region complex driven by collective effects . in dense starbust regions , the shape of the sed",
    "is therefore determined more on the scale of individual hii  regions , rather than on a galaxian scale .",
    "the size of each hii  region is therefore a function of both the mass of the central cluster and its age . to provide the correct geometry , we therefore need to understand the time evolution of individual hii  regions . an attempt to do this was recently described by dopita et al .",
    "@xcite , and this work forms the basis of the following section .",
    "in what follows , one should be aware that the problem of the evolution of the size of hii  regions in the interstellar medium is by no means trivial .",
    "although we will assume that the ism is uniform , and of a uniform pressure , such is certainly not the case in real objects .",
    "the turbulent multi - phase structure of the ism profoundly modifies the evolution of hii  regions .",
    "an attempt to model this , by evolving a source of uniform mass - loss in an isotropic log - normal density distribution ( which mathematically approximates to the structures produced in a turbulent medium ) is shown in [ fig2 ] .",
    "such models will be required in future modelling . for the time being , let us consider on the case of uniform pressure and density in the ism .",
    "the work of dopita et al .",
    "@xcite drew on the theory of the size distribution of hii  regions by oey & clark @xcite . in this , the hii  regions expand and evolve as stellar mass - loss and supernova driven bubbles for as long as their internal pressure exceeds the ambient pressure in the ism . when this condition is no longer met , the hii  region is assumed to `` stall ''",
    "of course , on reaching the stall condition , the hii  region does not abruptly stop expanding , but a momentum - conserving expansion continues until interstellar turbulence destroys the integrity of swept - up shell .",
    "the time taken to reach the stall radius turns out to be proportional to the stall radius , and the mass of the ob star cluster is important in determining the stall radius ; hii  regions with low mass clusters stall early and at small radius for a given pressure or density in the ism .",
    "the radius @xmath92 and internal pressure , @xmath93 , of a mass - loss pressurised hii  region are given by @xcite ; @xmath94 and @xmath95 here , @xmath96 is the mechanical luminosity of the mass - loss from the central stars , @xmath97 is the density of the ambient medium and @xmath98 is the time . the particle density is given in terms of the ambient density by @xmath99 , and the ambient pressure @xmath100 .",
    "eliminating @xmath98 between equations [ r ] and [ p ] , and setting @xmath101 we obtain the following conditions for stall : @xmath102    [ [ ionization - parameters ] ] * ionization parameters * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    equations [ pstall1 ] and [ pstall2 ] imply that , for any given pressure in the ism , all stalled hii  regions have a common ratio of @xmath103 . to the extent that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the flux of ionizing photons from the central stars , then all stalled hii  regions will be characterized by a common value of the ionization parameter , @xmath106 .",
    "this ionization parameter is very important in the theory of hii  region spectra since it is one of the three parameters which determine the emission line spectrum of the hii  region .",
    "the other two are the input spectrum of the exciting star(s ) and the gas - phase metallicity .    in fact , even for hii  regions which are not stalled",
    ", there is a unique value of the ionization parameter in the hii  region .",
    "this is because the pressure in the stellar winds at the outer boundary of the mass - loss bubble determines the equilibrium pressure in the hii  region plasma .",
    "thus , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the mean stellar wind velocity measured at the radius of termination of the free - wind region @xmath109 .",
    "this free - wind boundary is visible in fig [ fig2 ] as the boundary of the inner region where the cross - shaped cooling artifacts in the free - wind resulting from the finite wind injection region give way to the shocked hot turbulent gas filling the rest of the bubble .",
    "in general we can take @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "thus : @xmath112 since the hii  region temperature is always @xmath113k , then , for any central star cluster at a particular time in its evolution , the ionization parameter is determined solely by the instantaneous ratio of @xmath114 .",
    "thus , for coaeval clusters which are massive enough so that stochastic variations in these quantities are unimportant , the ionization parameter will be essentially independent of cluster mass and is only a function of cluster age .",
    "all the quantities needed to compute the ionization parameter , are given in the starburst99 output files .",
    "since the extended atmosphere of the exciting stars absorb a greater and greater fraction of the ionising photons as the metallicity increases , and at greater metallicity a greater fraction of the momentum flux in the radiation field is converted to mechanical energy in the winds , the ratio of @xmath114 strongly decreases as the metallicity increases .",
    "the effect of this on @xmath27 is shown in fig [ fig3 ] .     from starburst99 , with a mechanical energy efficiency factor of 0.1 .",

    "however , the general physics that drives the distribution of dust temperatures is readily understood .",
    "we saw above how hii  region in high pressure ( or density ) environments will stall at a smaller radius , according to the oey & clark theory @xcite .",
    "this means that the dust within the ionized gas of the hii  regions will be hotter when the ism pressure is high . at the outer boundary of the hii  region",
    "we normally expect to find molecular clouds in approximate pressure equilibrium with the ionized gas .",
    "therefore , the radiation field with energies below the lyman limit is absorbed by the gas and the dust in a rather thin photodissociation region ( pdr ) behind the ionization front which bounds these molecular clouds . at any point in the pdr , the local radiation field",
    "is determined only by the radiation field incident on the molecular cloud and by the optical depth up to that point . for a given grain size distribution and composition , the grain temperature distribution , and hence the far - ir re - emission function ,",
    "is determined by the local radiation field .",
    "the global far - ir spectrum is the integral of the local far - ir spectra through the pdr .",
    "hence the far - ir spectrum is determined only by the radiation field incident on the molecular cloud .",
    ", for a fixed size distribution of hii  region diameters , and for a range of ism pressures @xmath115@xmath63k . here the @xmath116 myr stellar population is assumed to reside within the hii  regions , and a @xmath117myr population provides an unobscured foreground contribution . the molecular cloud shell around the hii  regions is assumed to be destroyed on an e - folding timescale of 8 myr .",
    "note that the optical and uv line and continuum spectra are strongly dependent on metallicity , but that the far - ir peak is a function only of the pressure in the ism .",
    "note also the invariance of the pah emission features in the mid - ir .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the result of this is that smaller hii  regions , which are preferentially encountered in region of the ism with higher pressure will be characterised by hotter far - ir dust emission spectra .",
    "provided that the pdr remains thin in comparison with the radius of the hii  region , the far - ir spectrum of the ensemble of hii  regions remains a function only of the pressure .",
    "the abundance of the heavy elements can only make a difference when the changing abundance drives a changing grain size distribution , when the changing ratio of photon energy to mechanical energy produced by the central stars leads to a changing size distribution in the hii  region population , or when the opacity of the grains falls so low that the spherical divergence of the radiation field through the pdr becomes important .",
    "this dependence of the far - ir spectrum on pressure is illustrated in fig [ fig4 ] .",
    "the invariance of the pah features in these models is interesting .",
    "this occurs despite the fact that the abundance of changes by a factor of nearly 30 , and the relative abundance of pah molecules relative to silicaceous grains decreases strongly at low metallicity .",
    "the reason for this is that at the wavelength where they strongly absorb , the pah molecules dominate the total dust and molecular opacity .",
    "they therefore convert a fixed fraction of the bolometric luminosity of the star to pah emission features . in order to decrease the relative strength of the pah features at low metallicity",
    ", we need to ensure that the molecular clouds become `` leaky '' to the incident radiation , which requires that the column density in the molecular clouds does not exceed @xmath118 h atoms cm@xmath74 .",
