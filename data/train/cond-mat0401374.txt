    "the josephson effect may be the most fascinating and intriguing property of superconductors.@xmath5 in 1962 josephson predicted that supercurrents can flow through the insulating barrier between two superconductors due to the cooper pair tunneling.@xmath6 the supercurrent depends on the relative phase of two superconductors , where the phase is associated with the order parameter of the superconducting condensed state .",
    "the prediction was confirmed in experiments quickly.@xmath7 it is interesting that the experiment by nicol et al.@xmath8 showed already the possible dc supercurrent , although its reality was not noticed .",
    "this discovery led to the fabrication of the josephson junction devices and the high precision measurement of fundamental constants.@xmath9 now it seems that our understanding of the josephson effect is on firm ground.@xmath10    josephson@xmath5 used the tunneling hamiltonian@xmath11 to calculate tunneling currents between two superconductors and noticed that even at zero applied voltages , a dc supercurrent can occur . at finite voltages v",
    ", he found an ac supercurrent of the same amplitude as that of the dc supercurrent , with frequency 2ev / h .",
    "the amplitude of the supercurrent was calculated by anderson@xmath12 and ambegaokar and baratoff.@xmath13 at @xmath14 their result of the dc supercurrent , j , is @xmath15 with @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the phase difference of the two superconductors with the same energy gap @xmath18 .",
    "note that the amplitude of the supercurrent is proportional to the energy gap and inversely proportional to the tunneling resistance .",
    "however , there are still some fundamental experiments which remain puzzling.@xmath19 for instance , the pair - quasi particle interference term was shown to be negative in experiments , whereas the theory predicts positive sign.@xmath20 for ac josephson effect , likharev even claimed that _ there are more questions than answers_.@xmath21 furthermore , high @xmath0 cuprate josephson junctions are mainly sns type junctions , since sis junctions do not show the josephson effect.@xmath22 this result is not consistent with the above theory , which predicts bigger josephson current for higher @xmath0.@xmath23 recently , this behavior has also been found in @xmath1 sis junctions.@xmath24 in particular , the josephson supercurrent was not observed for the big gap ( @xmath25 ) of @xmath1 .",
    "we stress that this behavior is closely related to the anomalous dependence of the maximum dc josephson current on the tunneling resistance @xmath3 , found in low @xmath0 superconductors , such as pb and sn:@xmath26 the josephson current decreases much faster than @xmath2 above several @xmath27 .",
    "in this paper we present cooper pair wavefunction approach to the josephson effect .",
    "it is shown that the josephson coupling energy is determined by the overlap of the cooper pair wavefunctions of two superconductors divided by a thin insulating layer .",
    "( in fact , this idea was suggested by josephson in his original paper,@xmath6 and confirmed by ambegaokar and baratoff.@xmath13 however , it was not pursued thoroughly . )",
    "the critical current is , then , calculated from the coupling energy @xmath28 in the usual way.@xmath29 since the cooper pair tunneling can be understood more easily from the cooper pair wavefunction , this method is advantageous to deal with the josephson effect in high @xmath0 superconductors including mg@xmath30 and for the insulating barriers with high tunneling resistance @xmath3 .",
    "we have found that the cooper pair tunneling is strongly limited by the size of the cooper pair and its reduction during the tunneling . since the cooper pair size is also reduced by the impurity potential scattering",
    ", ordinary impurity also limits the supercurrent . as a result ,",
    "the josephson current is much smaller than expected in higher @xmath0 sis junctions and falls off much faster than @xmath2 for thicker and/or higher insulating barriers , in good agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "the preliminary result was reported before.@xmath31",
    "the approximate expression of the supercurrent suggested by josephson@xmath6 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the effective superconducting wavefunctions on the left and right sides , respectively.@xmath35 actually , it can be exact and it is better to write first the josephson coupling energy @xmath28 in terms of the cooper pair wavefunctions and then calculate the supercurrent j from @xmath28:@xmath29 @xmath36    figure 1 shows the real space cooper pair wavefunctions of two superconductors with the same energy gap near the insulating barrier .",
    "the solid lines denote the cooper pair wavefunctions in the absence of the barrier , whereas the thick lines denote the change of the cooper pair wavefunctions due to the insulating barrier .",
    "the josephson coupling energy is , therefore , determined by the overlap of the cooper pair wavefunctions , connected by the phonon green s function.@xmath37 previously , this idea was employed in some cases.@xmath38 for instance , for a pure superconductor without a barrier with the einstein phonons , the coupling energy or the pairing energy is given by @xmath39 where the ( effective ) cooper pair wavefunctions @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 are coupled by the einstein phonon green s function , i.e. , the dirac delta function , @xmath42 . here v is the phonon - mediated matrix element . in the same way",
    ", the josephson coupling energy @xmath28 is given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being the effective cooper pair wavefunctions in left and right sides .",
    "observe that this expression has the same form as the approximate one , eq .",
    "( 3 ) except the integration . in fact",
    ", ambegaokar and baratoff@xmath13 noted that josephson coupling ( free ) energy can be calculated by the overlap of cooper pair wavefunctions , which agrees with our result : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an explicit coupling constant and @xmath48 denotes the tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "figure 1 shows that it is essential to calculate the tail of the cooper pair wavefunctions to determine the josephson coupling energy .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize that eq .",
    "( 6 ) leads to the familiar result in k - space . from the tunneling hamiltonian@xmath11 @xmath49",

    "@xmath82 is the electron mass .",
    "the barrier extends from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",

    "unfortunately , the sums are divergent , which are common in the perturbation theory for continuous spectra .",

    "subsequently , one finds @xmath111 and @xmath112 with @xmath113 here @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the bcs coupling constants for two superconductors .",
    "we consider now eq . ( 6 ) , the josephson coupling energy in terms of the cooper pair wavefunctions .",
    "this method is more appropriate for high @xmath0 superconductors , including @xmath1 , which have tightly - bound cooper pairs with small size .",
    "it is also desirable for the insulating barrier with high tunneling resistance @xmath3 , since the cooper pair size shrinks significantly during the tunneling in that case .",
    "a similar reduction of the cooper pair size caused by the ordinary impurity scattering requires this approach , too .",
    "the cooper pair wavefunctions are expressed in terms of the one - particle wavefunctions , eq .",
    "( 16 ) : @xmath116 substituting eqs . ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) into eq .",

    "of course , the divergence in the sum implies this behavior needs to be corrected according to the bounded cooper pair wavefunction .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath126 ( in fact , @xmath127 denotes the center of mass coordinate of the cooper pair rather than the relative coordinate .",
    "since the phonon - mediated attraction between the electrons in the left - hand side can propagate only up to the range of the cooper pair size @xmath94 in the right - hand side , this assumption seems to be reasonable . ) inserting eq .",

    "@xmath131 will have the same exponential tail in the left side .",
    "as expected , the cooper pair wavefunction method leads to the same result for the josephson coupling energy and the supercurrent : @xmath132 where @xmath103      in the previous section we assumed that the tail of @xmath133 in the right side , eq .",
    "( 34 ) , is controlled by the same cooper pair size , @xmath94 , of the left side .",
    "in other words , we disregarded the effect of the insulating barrier potential on the cooper pair size .",
    "however , it is well - known that the cooper pair size is reduced due to the impurity potentials.@xmath134 therefore , it is obvious that this assumption is not appropriate especially for high @xmath0 superconductors , including @xmath1 , and for the insulating barriers with high tunneling resistance , @xmath3 , since the cooper pair will have so much difficulty in tunneling in these cases .",
    "we estimate the reduction of the cooper pair size due to the barrier potential .",
    "equation ( 33 ) implies that the decay length of the cooper pair wavefunction in the insulating barrier region is @xmath135 .",
    "whereas , after tunneling the cooper pair ( of size @xmath94 ) will have the memory of the phonon - mediated attraction up to @xmath136 .",
    "so we suppose that the cooper pair have size @xmath137 with the weight @xmath138 and @xmath94 with the weight @xmath139 .",

    "( 42 ) is @xmath146 just after tunneling , i.e. , @xmath147 thus , the cooper pair size shrinks significantly when @xmath148 , i.e. , for high @xmath0 superconductors , such as @xmath1 and for the insulating barriers with high @xmath3 . to put it another way ,",
    "there is a ( sample - dependent ) threshold tunneling resistance , @xmath149 , above which the supercurrent decreases much faster , although it is hard to determine the exact value of @xmath149 .    the overlap of the cooper pair wavefunctions is given by @xmath150 consequently , for @xmath148 the josephson coupling energy and the supercurrent are written as @xmath151 and @xmath152 with @xmath153 since the dc josephson current is very small in this case , fabrication of @xmath1 sis junctions requires very accurate nanometer scale manipulation of the insulating barriers .",
    "for instance , if @xmath154 , we need an insulating barrier of thickness d smaller than @xmath155 ( i.e. , @xmath156 to see the josephson supercurrent , which explains why the previous experiments could nt see the dc supercurrent corresponding to the big gap of @xmath1.@xmath24      we have found the maximum dc supercurrent : @xmath157 where @xmath158 for low @xmath3 the dc supercurrent is inversely proportional to @xmath3 , which may be called _ linear region _ , whereas for high @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath159 , the supercurrent decreases more quickly with increasing @xmath3 , which may be called _ steep region _ , although the boundary is not that sharp .",
    "this behavior agrees with the experiments.@xmath160 ( presumably in the _ steep region _ the supercurrent may drop to zero exponentially .",
    "this is the reason why we kept the exponential factor in the previous section . )",
    "one needs an interpolation formula that smoothly connects both limits , for low @xmath3 and for high @xmath3 .",

    "<S> we introduce a new approach to the josephson effect in sis tunnel junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson coupling energy is calculated from the overlap of real space cooper pair wavefunctions in two superconductors through an insulating barrier . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the josephson tunneling is limited by the size of the cooper pair and its shrinking during the tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the josephson coupling energy and the critical current become extremely small in high @xmath0 superconductors , including @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this shrinking also causes the observed dc supercurrent in low @xmath0 superconductors , such as pb and sn , to fall off much faster than @xmath2 for tunneling resistance @xmath3 above several ohms . </S>",
    "<S> consequently there is a material - dependent threshold resistance , above which the supercurrent decreases much faster with increasing resistance . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity - induced shrinking is also shown to limit the critical current . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the ( weak ) temperature dependence of the cooper pair size is found to contribute to the temperature dependence of the dc supercurrent .    </S>",
