    "ly@xmath1 blobs ( labs ) are radio - quiet , giant ( @xmath13@xmath14 kpc ) ly@xmath1 nebulae often discovered in overdense regions of star - forming galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "this new population of labs may be related to important physical processes in galaxy formation . however , the physical origin of the extended ly@xmath1 nebulae is mysterious .",
    "although similar giant ly@xmath1 nebulae are often seen around high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) , they are thought to be related to their radio jets and are presumably not the same population as the radio - quiet labs .",
    "there are at least three possibilities for the origin of labs : ( 1 ) ly@xmath1 cooling radiation resulting from gravitational heating , ( 2 ) photoionization by metal free massive ( popiii ) stars , or obscured starburst and agn @xcite , and ( 3 ) shock heating by starburst - driven galactic superwind @xcite .",
    "recent observations have revealed that labs show large ( @xmath15 500 km s@xmath7 ) ly@xmath1 velocity widths @xcite and that a significant fraction of labs display high luminosity infrared dust continuum emission @xcite .",
    "these properties suggest ( 2 ) and/or ( 3 ) as the possible origin of the labs , and a close relationship to the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "ssa 22 lab1 at @xmath2 is the best suitable target to reveal the origin of labs .",
    "its spatial extent of @xmath16 kpc and a ly@xmath1 luminosity of @xmath17 ergs s@xmath7 places this as one of the largest and brightest objects among the known labs @xcite . in a very deep ly@xmath1 image taken with the subaru prime - focus camera ( suprime - cam ) , bubble like structures are seen in lab1 , which may be evidence for galactic superwind @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated in their numerical simulations that such bubbles can be produced by galactic superwind from a proto - galaxy . in their model , at first , multiple gas clumps are distributed throughout a dark matter halo .",
    "subsequently , starbursts occur coincidently in these clumps through interactions or mergers , and drive large scale gas outflows .",
    "the system evolves into an elliptical galaxy at the present epoch .",
    "ssa 22 lab1 has been observed @xcite with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "an unresolved submillimeter source was detected towards lab1 with a @xmath10 flux density of @xmath18 mjy , which makes this one of the brightest submillimeter sources at high redshifts detected to date @xcite . however , the angular resolution of @xmath9 of the scuba is insufficient to precisely identify the optical counterpart and to investigate the spatial extent of the star - formation activity in lab1 .",
    "although several faint optical components were detected near the center of lab1 with hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations @xcite , it has not been confirmed that they are optical counterparts to the submillimeter source yet .",
    "a radio source was detected with a 1.4 ghz flux density of @xmath19jy ( @xmath20 ) at one of the optical components , j1 , which is possibly the counterpart to the submillimeter source @xcite .",
    "however , a very red @xmath21 band source ( @xmath22 ) was detected at another optical component , j2 @xcite , which is @xmath0 from j1 .",
    "very recently , j2 was also identified as a mid - infrared source with spitzer / irac observations and it is also possibly the counterpart to the submillimeter source @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the submillimeter emission of lab1 may not be associated with compact source(s ) , but has a large spatial extent due to galactic superwind similar to the nearby starburst galaxy , m82 , in which the distribution of dust is spread out beyond the central ( optical ) starburst region . in order to examine the spatial extent of star - formation activity and to seek the relation between the production of labs and galactic superwinds , higher angular resolution and more sensitive submillimeter observations",
    "are required .    the submillimeter array ( sma , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides an angular resolution of @xmath0 , which is about eight times higher than that with scuba .",
    "it is also sensitive enough to detect bright submillimeter sources at high redshifts in a full night of observation . for these reasons ,",
    "the sma is a very powerful instrument to examine the morphology of submillimeter sources at high redshifts .",
    "for example , @xcite have successfully detected submillimeter emission at the @xmath23 level for two 20 mjy submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) , smm j123711 + 6222212 and mips j142824.0 + 352619 , using the sma , and they obtained firm upper limits of @xmath24 to the source sizes . in this letter we report a result of @xmath0 resolution interferometric submillimeter observation of ssa22 lab1 with the sma and discuss the nature of the object .",
    "we assume a flat universe of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ( @xmath28 corresponds to a physical length of 7.6 kpc at @xmath2 ) .",
    "observations were carried out on 2006 september 24 ( 1 track , 4.5 hours on source ) using eight antennas in the compact configuration of the sma .",
    "the sis receivers were tuned to a center frequency of 345  ghz ( 869@xmath29 ) in the upper sideband ( usb ) , yielding 335  ghz ( 895@xmath29 ) in the lower sideband ( lsb ) .",
    "the sma correlator had 2 ghz total bandwidth in each sideband .",
    "the adopted phase reference center of the target source was @xmath1  ( j2000 )  @xmath30 , @xmath31  ( j2000 )  @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the track was taken under good atmospheric opacity ( i.e. @xmath33 ) .",
    "the range of ( unprojected ) baseline lengths was 16  69 meters .",
    "the sma data were calibrated using the caltech software package mir , modified for the sma .",
    "antenna based passband calibration was done using two bright qsos , j2225@xmath340457 ( 3c446 , 1.4  jy ) and j2148 + 0657 ( 1.0  jy ) , as well as uranus ( 69.0  jy ) and callisto ( 5.0  jy ) .",
    "antenna based time - dependent complex gain calibration was carried out using two qsos , j2225@xmath340457 ( 1.4  jy ; 6@xmath35 away from the target ) and j2148 + 0657 ( 1.0  jy ; 10@xmath35 ) .",
    "the astrometry was checked by applying the phase calibration to a nearby qso j2218@xmath340335 ( 0.2  jy ; 4@xmath35 ) and we assess the accuracy of the astrometry to be @xmath36 .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of all of these calibrators is better than 10 milliarcsec , and the positional reference is the international celestial reference frame ( icrf , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , absolute flux calibration was performed using callisto .",
    "data calibrations were carried out by two independent groups , which allowed us to confirm the repeatability and the robustness of the results .",
    "imaging was carried out in miriad @xcite .",
    "the natural weighted beam gave a synthesized beam size of @xmath4 ( fwhm , p.a .",
    "= @xmath37 ) .",
    "the rms noise after combining the two sidebands ( effectively at @xmath38 ) is 1.4  mjy .",
    "the fwhm of the primary beam is @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ map ] shows the 880@xmath29 continuum map of ssa 22 lab1 .",
    "no significant emission is detected at the 3@xmath6 limit of 4.2 mjy beam@xmath7 in the field of view of @xmath8 .",
    "if we adopt a dust temperature of @xmath39 k and a power - law emissivity spectral index of @xmath40 @xcite , the extrapolated @xmath3 flux density of lab1 is 16.2 mjy from the scuba @xmath10 flux density of 17.4 mjy . if there were a single unresolved source , it would be detected at @xmath41 level in the @xmath3 map . thus the non - detection suggests the existence of a spatially extended submillimeter emission associated with lab1 assuming that the scuba detection is real .",
    "alternatively , if there are multiple compact sources , the flux density of each source is lower than the 3@xmath6 limit of 4.2 mjy beam@xmath7 and therefore at least four sources are needed to produce the total flux density of 16.2 mjy .",
    "widely spaced distribution of the sources is also required to satisfy the @xmath42 limit ; the separation of the sources should be larger than the beam size of @xmath0 ( 15 kpc ) .",
    "we note that what appears like artifacts in the map actually arises from high side - lobe level that extends n - s of the synthesized beam .",
    "the synthesized beam has up to 70% side - lobes because the source is at zero declination .",
    "the noise peaks in the resultant maps also carry this high side - lobe , resulting in structure that appears like diagonal ridges .",
    "the theoretical noise level derived using the observed sma parameters are consistent with the observed rms of 1.4 mjy .    in order to check the appearance of spatially extended sources in the sma 880@xmath29 map",
    ", we carried out simulations of the sma observations using @xmath43 in miriad ( figure  [ sim ] ) . in this simulation , we consider three model sources , each of which has a single gaussian profile with the fwhm of 1 , 4 , and 8 .",
    "we assume that the sources have a total flux density of 16.2 mjy intrinsically and are placed at the phase center of the maps .",
    "we use the same observational parameters ( i.e. the configuration of the sma antennas , the coordinates of the source , and the hour angle range ) for this simulation . the rms noise of 1.4 mjy beam@xmath7 in the simulated maps is the same as that of the observed map .",
    "the simulation shows that we could detect the source with fwhm of 1 at 10@xmath6 level , and with fwhm of 4 at 3@xmath6 level in the observed map .",
    "however , the source is resolved out when the diameter of the source is larger than fwhm of 8 .",
    "note that these simulations do not include possible pointing and phase calibration errors .",
    "thus , a conservative lower limit of the fwhm of the spatial extent of the submillimeter emission is @xmath11 .",
    "since the source is unresolved in the previous @xmath9 resolution scuba map @xcite , a conservative upper limit of the fwhm is @xmath9 .",
    "the fwhm of the submillimeter emission associated to lab1 should range from @xmath11 to @xmath9 , which corresponds to @xmath44 kpc at @xmath2 , if it is indeed a single source .",
    "figure  [ uv ] shows the visibility amplitude versus projected baseline with @xmath45 error bars . assuming the source position is at the phase center",
    ", we calculate the vector averaged amplitudes from the visibility data in circular bins of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 k@xmath50 .",
    "each bin contains about 3000  8000 raw visibility points .",
    "the visibility amplitude shows a marginal ( 2.7@xmath6 ) excess at the bin that represents data for @xmath46 k@xmath50 .",
    "we also plot the total @xmath3 flux density extrapolated from the scuba measurement ( @xmath51  mjy ) at the projected baseline of zero . in order to constrain the spatial extent of the submillimeter emission",
    ", we fit a gaussian profile to the visibility data and the total flux density data .",
    "the best fit gaussian source has a flux density of @xmath52 mjy and a fwhm of @xmath53 , which corresponds to @xmath54 kpc at @xmath2 .",
    "the suggested source size of @xmath55 from the visibility data is consistent with the range of the source size of @xmath56 expected from the simulations .    to increase the detectability of the extended submillimeter emission",
    ", we tapered the visibility data with a gaussian that has a fwhm of @xmath57 ( figure  [ taper ] ) .",
    "the synthesized beam size of the map is @xmath58 and the rms noise is 2.8 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "however , we could not detect the extended submillimeter emission in the map at the 3 @xmath6 limit of 8.4 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "the peak flux density of 6.0 mjy beam@xmath7 ( 2.1 @xmath6 ) is expected for the source with the fwhm of @xmath55 and the total flux density of 16.2mjy .",
    "thus the non - detection in the lower resolution map is consistent with the expected peak flux density of the extended submillimeter emission .    in summary ,",
    "the data suggest that the spatial extent of the submillimeter emission of lab1 should be larger than @xmath11 ( @xmath12 kpc ) , if the source has a gaussian profile .",
    "however , the s / n of the data is too low to distinguish whether the submillimeter emission comes from a single extended source , widely spaced multiple compact sources , or a combination of both .",
    "we discuss possible interpretations of the spatially extended submillimeter emission of lab1 .",
    "one possible ( and probably most likely ) interpretation is spatially extended star - formation in lab1 .",
    "there is evidence to support this interpretation .",
    "it seems that the uv continuum emission is also spatially extended in lab1 .",
    "figure  [ spcam ]  ( left ) shows @xmath59-band ( uv continuum at the rest frame of lab1 ) image contours superposed on the 880@xmath29 map .",
    "the resolution of the @xmath59-band image is @xmath28 .",
    "the astrometric system of the image is defined by the reference frame of the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite , and the typical rms error is less than @xmath60 . in figure  [ spcam ]  ( left ) , we label uv continuum sources that are possibly associated with lab1 , c11 @xcite , j1  4 sources @xcite , and a1  6 .",
    "the uv continuum sources are widely spaced and have the median separation of @xmath61 .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift of c11 was measured to be the same as lab1 @xcite .",
    "there is a marginal ( @xmath62 ) excess of submillimeter emission at the position of c11 , suggesting that c11 is one of the counterparts of the submillimeter emission .",
    "a2 shows a marginal narrow - band deficit ( @xmath63 mag ) , which suggests it has ly@xmath1 absorption at @xmath2 and is associated with lab1 .",
    "we derived the photometric redshifts of the uv continuum sources inside the ly@xmath1 nebula using palomar @xmath64-band image @xcite and suprime - cam @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath59 , @xmath67 , and , @xmath68 bands images @xcite with hyperz .",
    "we found that the sources brighter than @xmath69 magnitude ( i.e. c11 , j1  3 , and a1  3 ) show photometric redshifts between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these redshifts are consistent with @xmath2 , if we consider the estimated uncertainty of the photometric redshifts of @xmath72",
    ". moreover diffuse uv continuum emission seems to connect these sources with each other .",
    "the diffuse uv continuum emission may be tidal tails and bridges due to interactions of these sources .",
    "the photometric redshifts of the uv continuum sources and the connecting diffuse uv continuum emission suggest that most of the uv continuum sources are associated with lab1 .",
    "it is possible that the distribution of the submillimeter emission is similar to that of the uv continuum emission .",
    "we derive a star - formation rate ( sfr ) in lab1 of 1400 @xmath73 yr@xmath7 from the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity of @xmath74 @xcite and the relation between far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity and sfr , @xmath75 .",
    "the large sfr of lab1 suggests that intense starbursts occur in lab1 .",
    "we also derive an average sfr surface density of @xmath76 @xmath73 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath77 from dividing the sfr by the area of the submillimeter emission , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a half size of the fwhm of the submillimeter emission of 40 kpc .",
    "the average sfr surface density of lab1 is comparable to those of local starburst galaxies estimated from fir luminosity and h@xmath1 size @xcite .",
    "thus the large spatial extent of the submillimeter emission and the high average sfr surface density suggest that starbursts occur throughout the large area in lab1 .",
    "we also derive a sfr in lab1 of 220 @xmath73 yr@xmath7 from the uv luminosity density at @xmath80   of @xmath81 for the uv continuum emission inside the ly@xmath1 nebula and the relation between uv luminosity density and sfr , @xmath82 .",
    "we do not correct for dust extinction in this calculation .",
    "the sfr derived from the uv continuum emission is about an order of magnitude lower than that derived from the submillimeter emission .",
    "the difference suggests that most of the uv continuum emission produced from star - formation activity in lab1 is attenuated by dust .",
    "there may be buried , unidentified uv continuum sources in lab1 .",
    "it is worth noting here that recent spitzer / mips @xmath83 observations have also given us a hint that labs have multiple dusty sources .",
    "@xcite detected two or three @xmath83 sources at the positions of two labs at @xmath84 , which are possibly associated with the labs .",
    "the separations of these @xmath83 sources are @xmath85 kpc , similar to or somewhat larger than the separations of the possible optical counterparts ( i.e. uv continuum sources ) of lab1 .",
    "the widely spaced dusty sources may be a common feature of labs .",
    "some part of the submillimeter emission can be interpreted as thermal emission from spatially extended dust expelled from starburst regions by galactic superwind .",
    "since lab1 shows possible evidence for galactic superwind ( i.e bubble like structures seen in its ly@xmath1 nebula ) , it may have a large amount of dust entrained in gas outflows .",
    "figure  [ spcam ]  ( right ) shows ly@xmath1 image contours superposed on the 880@xmath29 map . while the s / n of the submillimeter emission is low and may not be adequate for conclusive determinations , the submillimeter features seem to correlate with the high surface brightness regions of ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "the possible correlation in distributions between submillimeter and ly@xmath1 emissions is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "@xcite found a ly@xmath1 velocity gradient around c11 and argued that a bipolar outflow seen in m82 is a local analog for c11 .",
    "in fact , m82 shows not only an extended h@xmath1 emission - line nebula associated with the bipolar gas outflow @xcite but also extended dust emission .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath86 dust emission extends to 6 kpc from the central starburst region of m82 , and the extended emission accounts for about one - third of the total @xmath86 flux with irac observations .",
    "thus , it is possible that the thermal emission from the spatially extended dust expelled from starburst regions also contributes the spatially extended submillimeter emission of lab1 . in this picture ,",
    "some of the extended ly@xmath1 and uv continuum emission of lab1 may be light scattered by spatially extended dust .      the sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) increment is another possible interpretation for the spatially extended submillimeter emission . there is evidence that lab1 lies in a deep dark matter potential well made by the proto - cluster at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the dynamical mass of lab1 is estimated to be @xmath87 m@xmath88 from the size and the velocity width of ly@xmath1 emission @xcite .",
    "however , a 450@xmath29 emission with a flux density of @xmath89 mjy was detected toward lab1 and the measured 450/850 @xmath29 ratio is an order of magnitude higher than the expected one from the s - z increment @xcite .",
    "thus , the s - z increment is not a likely interpretation .",
    "the _ non - detection _ of submillimeter emission in the sma map may be due to time - variability of dust emission around a buried agn , but past observational results provide evidence that this is unlikely .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of lab1 suggests that the contribution of non - thermal emission to submillimeter wavelength must be negligible .",
    "the sma observations of lab1 are about five years after the scuba observations . if the source shows time - variability , the submillimeter flux density had to decrease by a factor of four or more in five years ( one year in rest frame ) . in order to produce the time - variability in such time - scale , the required size of dust distribution around a nucleus is less than about one light year ( @xmath90 pc ) . taking the fir luminosity of @xmath74 and the dust temperature of @xmath39 k , we estimate the minimum source size of @xmath91 kpc . for the optically thin case ,",
    "the source size is estimated to be much larger .",
    "thus , the minimum source size is inconsistent with the required source size for time - variability .      in order to investigate the relation of lab1 to other luminous submillimeter populations at high redshifts such as smgs and hzrgs",
    ", we compare the spatial extents of the submillimeter emission of these objects .",
    "the spatial extents of the submillimeter emission of smgs are 5  20 times smaller than that of lab1 .",
    "@xcite estimated the median submillimeter source size to be @xmath92 ( 4 kpc ) from @xmath93 resolution millimeter continuum and co imaging of eight smgs at @xmath94 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) .",
    "@xcite directly constrain the upper limits of the submillimeter source size of @xmath24 from @xmath0 resolution submillimeter imaging of two luminous smgs with the sma .",
    "although some of the smgs are resolved into two compact sources @xcite , most smgs are single compact sources .",
    "thus the majority of the smgs appear to be much more compact in submillimeter than lab1 .",
    "the spatial extent of the submillimeter emission of hzrgs is similar to or somewhat larger than that of lab1 .",
    "high resolution millimeter observations with the iram pdbi revealed the spatially extended dust and gas in hzrgs .",
    "@xcite found that the millimeter and co emissions in a radio galaxy 4c 60.07 at @xmath95 extends over @xmath96 kpc .",
    "also found that evidence for spatially resolved dust emission at scales of @xmath97 to @xmath57 in b3 j2330 + 3927 at @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite found that five of seven hzrgs are resolved even with the @xmath9 scuba beam and the fwhm of the submillimeter emission ranges from 50 to 250 kpc . since hzrgs are known to lie in overdense regions as well as lab1 , both of hzrgs and lab1 may have spatially extended starbursts induced by interactions and mergers of gas clumps in overdense environments at high redshifts .",
    "the @xmath0 resolution submillimeter observations of ssa22 lab1 provide evidence that the associated submillimeter emission extends larger than @xmath11 ( @xmath13 kpc ) . the most likely interpretation for the extended submillimeter emission",
    "is spatially extended star - formation in lab1 .",
    "the derived sfr surface density suggests that starbursts occur throughout the large area in lab1 .",
    "the hint of a possible correlation in distributions between submillimeter and ly@xmath1 emissions suggests that the thermal emission from the spatially extended dust expelled from starburst regions by galactic superwind may contribute the spatially extended submillimeter emission of lab1 .",
    "the spatial extent of submillimeter emission of lab1 is similar to those of hzrgs rather than smgs .",
