    "the etymology of the word _",
    "folksonomy _ shows that it s a portmanteau of the words _ folks _ and _ taxonomy _ coined by thomas vander wal@xcite , which implies that it could be understood as an organization by folks , especially of the contents over the world wide web .",
    "being different from the traditional approaches to the classification , the classifiers in folksonomy are not the dedicated professionals , and thomas vander wal described this as a `` bottom - up social classification''@xcite .",
    "adam mathes explains folksonomy that users of the documents and media create metadata - data about data - for their own individual use that is also shared throughout a community@xcite .",
    "del.icio.us ( ` http://del.icio.us ` ) , furl ( ` http://www.furl.net ` ) and flickr ( ` http://www.flickr.com ` ) are three most popular folksonomies .",
    "their users describe and organize the content ( bookmarks , webpages or photos ) with their own vocabulary and assign one or more keywords , namely _ tags _ , to each single unit of content .",
    "the folksonomy is thus implemented through the tags assigned .",
    "therefore , _ tags _ are now the mainstream approach to the application of folksonomy , and folksonomy is currently often understood as _",
    "as was mentioned above , folksonomy enables users to share their individual use of tags in the community .",
    "users share various contents under one same tag , or share different tags assigned to one piece of content .",
    "thus tags are linked to each other and so are the contents .",
    "such a feature makes it possible to understand the folksonomy a network of tags or contents .    besides the network of folksonomy ,",
    "some similar networks were reported to display the properties of small world or scale free.@xcite it is possible to measure the graph properties of world wide web in order to quantify the information therein and give out an the explanation or its evolution.@xcite in 2001 ferrer i cancho and sol defined a network in english language .",
    "another study by yook , jeong and barabsi constructed a network based on the synonym according to merriam - webster dictionary .",
    "they observed a small average path length clustering coefficient and power - law degree distribution@xcite@xcite , and indicated that language also forms a complex network in some respects .",
    "rosa gil _ _ et al.__@xcite model and analyze the semantic web as complex system .    in the light of these works and results ,",
    "the network of folksonomy can be defined and constructed . while comparing this network with that modeled by rosa gil _ _ et al.__@xcite , the difference lied mainly in the difference between the _ tags _ and the ontologies in the _ daml ontology library_.",
    "in order to learn the conformation of the folksonomy network realized through tags , to see whether it displays such properties of small world or scale free and to measure the folksonomy , the model of the network must be defined first .",
    "folksonomy can be considered as a graph where nodes represent the tags and different tags assigned to one piece of content are linked by edges .",
    "this graph is an undirected graph .",
    "regardless of multiple contents covering two tags , the graph is not a weighted graph .",
    "degree distribution : :    for an selected node @xmath0 in the folksonomy network , its    degree @xmath1 represents the number of tags which share at    least one piece of content with the tag ( or node ) @xmath0 . for    each network ,",
    "the spread in node degree follows a distribution    function @xmath2 . for _ scale free _ networks ,",
    "the degree is    in a power - law distribution @xmath3 clustering coefficient : :    for node @xmath0 with the degree @xmath1 , it is    connected with @xmath1 nodes in the network .",
    "there are    @xmath4 edges in this subgraph of @xmath1 size ,    and could be at most @xmath5    edges between these @xmath1 nodes .",
    "the ratio    @xmath6is the clustering    coefficient of the node @xmath0 .",
    "the clustering coefficient    @xmath7 measures the interrelatedness of @xmath0 s    neighbors .",
    "average path length : :    for two nodes @xmath8 in the same connected component ,    @xmath9 is the minimum length of path between them .",
    "the    average path length @xmath10 is the average value of all    @xmath9 .",
    "the data set of the experiment is based on the records of the bookmarks submitted to del.icio.us during 26 mar .",
    "to 27 mar .",
    "del.icio.us provides the service that enables users to categorize their bookmarks or links with _",
    "tags_.    all the data used in this experiment is available through the subscription of rss feed of del.icio.us ( ` http://del.icio.us/rss ` ) .",
    "for each entry of the bookmarks , only the information of the url , the time of submission and the tags were recorded .",
    "other information as the creator , the title was ignored in the experiment .    for every distinct url , all the tags attributed to",
    "it will be linked to each other with edges .",
    "the network is thus constructed .",
    "random networks were first defined by p. erds and a. rnyi in 1959 .",
    "in such a _ random network _ of erds - rnyi model , the average path length @xmath11 is small with regard to the size @xmath12 of the network , @xmath13 and its clustering coefficient @xmath14    the _ small world _ network of watt - strogatz displays@xcite@xcite , as the random network with the same @xmath12 and @xmath15 , the similar property of small average path length @xmath16however with a relatively high clustering coefficient@xmath17    the properties of the network of folksonomy tags in experiment turns out as follows .    *",
    "* nodes ( the number of tags ) * @xmath12 : 9804 * * average node degree * @xmath15 : 11.0 * * clustering coefficient * @xmath18 : 0.06 * * average path length * @xmath10 : 3.40    for the network in the experiment , its average path length @xmath19 is approximately the length @xmath20 of the corresponding random network . and its clustering coefficient @xmath21 is much larger than the prediction @xmath22",
    "if the network is random . therefore it can be concluded to be an small world network .",
    "lots of real networks are reported to be _ _ scale free__@xcite , i.e. its degree distribution @xmath2 is in power - law @xmath3 while in erds and rnyi s theory , the degree distribution @xmath2 of a random network will follow poisson distribution .",
    "the property of scale free can be detected in the folksonomy network .",
    "figure 1 indicates the distribution is linear in logarithmic scale , as well as its complementary cumulative distribution function , ccdf , in figure 2 .",
    "the result from the folksonomy network ( see figure 1 ) shows its degree distribution decays at the rate of @xmath23 , where the power - law exponent @xmath24 is @xmath25 .",
    "table 1 is a top-20 list of tags involved in experiment with the most degree in the network , namely , those have the most contacts with the other tags .",

    "the experiment samples a part of the folksonomy at del.icio.us , which demonstrated above that the folksonomy as a network formed by tags displays both nature of _ small world _ and _ scale free_.    however the folksonomy network is said to be _ small world _ and _ scale free _ as local properties .",
    "the body of folksonomy is much larger than this fragment .",
    "all tags over www indexed by technorati are more than 1 million@xcite .",
    "it is possible that the panorama of folksonomy and the parameters of the whole network would differ from the present local ones .",
    "since users and authors over www submits their contents to folksonomy every minute , the network of folksonomy evolves over time .",
    "the work in the experiment surveyed the static properties of a folksonomy network , but the network is dynamically increasing every moment .",
    "the study of dynamics on the complex networks will be applied to the further analysis of folksonomy s structure , behavior including its forming mechanism . since folksonomy is a classification system of web contents , its properties both static and dynamic",
    "can also serve to search and retrieve the related information .",
