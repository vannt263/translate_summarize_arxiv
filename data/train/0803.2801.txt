    "there is growing evidence that all massive galaxies contain a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at their centres ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",

    "powerful ( @xmath9 ) radio sources are more common at high ( @xmath101 ) redshifts .",
    "they are believed to have central smbhs with uniformly high accretion rates at the highest radio luminosities and relatively low duty cycles ( e.g. rawlings & saunders 1991 ) .",
    "low - luminosity radio jets can , however , be associated with high - accretion - rate systems , and these so - called ` radio - quiet ' quasars appear to have similar fri - like radio structures to the low - accretion - rate counterparts of similar radio luminosity objects ( e.g. heywood et al .  2007 ) . at low redshift ,",
    "the most massive ( @xmath6 @xmath11 ) smbhs typically have very low accretion rates with systematically higher average values at @xmath10 2 , the so - called ` quasar epoch ' ( yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "these observational results fit in with theoretical ideas that a ` quasar mode ' of feedback is prevalent in the distant universe , and that a ` radio mode ' of feedback is dominant at low redshift ( e.g. croton et al .",

    "the torus creates anisotropic obscuration of the central regions resulting in two different types of observed objects , type 1 that are viewed face - on and type 2 that are viewed edge - on .",
    "here we use mid - ir observations to search for evidence of accretion in a manner which is far less dependent on orientation .",

    ", there have been many attempts to classify radio sources according to their observed properties : e.g. their structure , energy output and environment .",
    "fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) classified radio sources according to their structure by measuring the ratio of distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour @xmath12 . this way , for fri radio sources we get @xmath13 which makes them edge - darkened , while friis have @xmath14 meaning they are edge - brightened .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the catalogues contain a variety of adaptive and fixed aperture magnitudes , which have been measured from the image data using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . for the purpose of sed fitting , it was important to select those apertures which provided the most accurate colour information for each object .",
    "whilst the adaptive ( such as kron and isophotal ) magnitudes provide a good estimate of the total flux of an object ( without the need for an aperture correction to be derived based upon the galaxy s assumed surface brightness distribution and the seeing , as is required to correct a small fixed aperture ) , the apertures must generally be large , containing areas of low surface brightness which increase the photometric error .",
    "also , an adaptive aperture might be a different size in each measured band and thus sample a different component of the stellar population , potentially leading to unphysical colours . for these reasons , and because of the problems using adaptive apertures at faint magnitudes ( where errors in determining the correct isophotal or kron radii can exacerbate photometric errors in low signal - to - noise images )",
    ", we decided to use fixed aperture photometry for our sed fitting .",
    "however , fixed apertures have their own issues to consider .",
    "in the ideal situation , we would have a set of images with the same psf , perfectly registered astrometrically .",
    "it would then be possible to extract photometry using apertures placed in exactly the same positions in each image , and we could be confident that , whatever the aperture size , we would be sampling the same fraction of the light from the same regions of each galaxy studied . but this is far from the case when combining data taken with different instruments , under different seeing conditions , as we are doing here .",
    "it was undesirable on confusion grounds to degrade the optical and near - ir data to match the large psf of the spitzer bands , so we chose the aperture size to minimise the systematic differences in the fraction of the flux measured in each band .    clearly , there is a trade - off to be made  too large an aperture is vulnerable to confusion and increased background noise , while an aperture which is very small will contain very different fractions of the total flux for images with different psfs . to investigate this trade off in detail",
    ", we looked at the mean difference between aperture magnitudes and the sextractor mag_auto magnitudes , which uses an adaptive kron aperture to estimate the total flux .",
    "for the smallest aperture available in all bands ( 2 arcsec ) there were large offsets ( of order 0.20.3 mags ) between the aperture and kron magnitudes , but the most importantly these offsets were very different in the different bands .",
    "with the next available aperture diameter ( 3 arcsec ) the mean differences in the aperture and kron magnitudes were much smaller  less than a tenth of a magnitude .",
    "deeming this an acceptable systematic error , we decided to use 3-arcsec apertures for all photometry .    to combine the catalogues across the optical and infrared bands",
    ", we assumed that the closest match between extracted objects , within a search radius of 2 arcsec relative to the radio position ( chosen to allow for differences in astrometry between different photometric bands ) , was the correct association , with the constraint that a catalogue entry was only permitted to match once per band .",
    "we used both empirical and evolving galaxy seds in the template fitting .",
    "the empirical templates used were the ones supplied with the hyperz code , which are four typical observed galaxy spectra taken from coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ; henceforth cww ) , extended in the ultraviolet and infrared by matched models ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "the evolving templates were generated using ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ; henceforth bc ) , with 14 exponentially decaying star formation rates with e - folding timescales ranging from 0.1 to 30 gyr , plus an instantaneous burst , a finite burst and a constant star formation rate template , all with solar metallicity and a salpeter initial mass function for the stars .",
    "this is a larger number of bc templates than used by bolzonella et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but our intention was to span the space of possible galaxy types as finely as possible , in the hope that there would always be a template with similar star formation history to any object in the dataset , and that this would then be the best fit .    both empirical and evolving seds were used because parallel work by van breukelen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) seemed to indicate that , while the evolving templates gave slightly more accurate results on spectroscopically identified ( and thus also reasonably bright ) samples , they more quickly broke down , giving catastrophic redshift estimates , as signal - to - noise was reduced .",
    "catastrophically wrong redshift estimates produced by the two sets of templates are generally different , so agreement between the results obtained with the cww and bc seds is useful to improve confidence that a particular redshift estimate is correct . where the estimates differ significantly , it is more often the case that the cww estimate is closer to reality , though this effect is difficult to quantify precisely since catastrophic redshift estimates are a function of the template set , as well as the precise signal - to - noise in each observed band .",
