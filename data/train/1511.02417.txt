    "<S> we report on fabrication of a two - dimensional topological insulator - bi(111 ) bilayer on sb nanofilms via a sequential molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) growth technique . </S>",

    "<S> our results and methodology of fabricating nanoscale heterostructures establish the bi bilayer / sb heterostructure as a platform of great potential for both ultralow - energy - cost electronics and surface - based spintronics .    the last decade has witnessed an enormous research interest in exploration of various topological electronic phases of condensed matters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many distinct topological phases protected by either the time reversal symmetry or crystalline symmetries have been experimentally realized . among these emergent phases , </S>",
    "<S> the two dimensional ( 2d ) topologial ( quantum spin hall ) insulator ( ti ) , the first - ever proposed prototype of topological insulators ( ti ) , stands uniquely important for nanoelectronics applications . </S>",
    "<S> this system hosts one dimensional topological edge modes in the energy gap with spin - up and spin - down carriers propagating in opposite directions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - momentum - locked character , arising as a consequence of the time - reversal symmetry , suppresses backscatterings in the edge conduction channels , which is a key feature for the realization of dissipationless electronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> one of prototypical 2d tis is bi(111 ) bilayer and there have been significant experimental progresses to prepare this artificial material in laboratory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the topological edge modes have been observed on a bi(111 ) bilayer prepared on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and bulk bi . </S>",
    "<S> the edge modes are exposed on the surface , which permits direct spectroscopic characterizations and surface manipulation at the atomic level . </S>",
    "<S> however , in these experiments , the substrates supporting bi(111 ) bilayer are metallic and , thus , the edge modes in these systems are degenerate with the bulk modes . as a result , their contribution to the system conductivity is overwhelmed by the bulk conductivity , making them nonideal for @xmath2 conduction channels needed for 2d ti applications .    </S>",
    "<S> one way to make progress toward useful isolated 2d ti is to employ ultrathin films as substrates , instead of directly growing 2d ti overlayer on a semiconductor substrate as theoretically proposed @xcite , but could be experimentally challenging . </S>",
    "<S> the thinner the supporting substrate is , the fewer bulk carriers contribute to the overall conductance . more precisely , when the thickness of the substrate is reduced to a few atomic layers , the valence and conduction bands of the substate are discretized into quantum well ( qw ) subbands as a result of quantum confinement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy separation between adjacent qw subbands increases as the substrate film thickness is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting energy gaps can be made large enough to suppress or even eliminate the bulk conduction channels making topological edge modes in 2d ti more pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> this idea motivated us to fabricate by the method of molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) bi(111 ) bilayer on ultrathin sb films , another topological system with a similar crystal structure @xcite . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> , the thickness of the supporting sb films can be precisely controlled down to four atomic layers . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a systematic angle - resolved photoemission measurement ( arpes ) on the mbe - grown heterostructure with various sb film thicknesses , demonstrating the evolution of the electronic band structure of the heterostructure as a function of the film thickness and revealing the existence of a 2d spinful massless electron gas within the top bi bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> all these experimental observations are reproduced by our first - principles calculation with a remarkable consistency . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our calculation further show that there exist a pair of isolated topological edge states at the edge of bi bilayer within a partial bulk band gap about 0.32 ev above the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of the partial bulk band gap and the isolation of the topological edge states from the bulk states is a direct consequence of quantum confinement effect in the reduced dimension as discussed above . within this partial gap , </S>",
    "<S> even though there still exist bulk state residuals , the contribution from the topological edge modes can dominate in conduction , forming a spin channel with backscattering suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we show through a combined method of arpes experiment and first - principles calculation that the adverse hybridization effect of the substrate on the functional overlayer can be systematically suppressed by reducing the thickness of the substrate , and thus , the desirable properties of overlayer can be enhanced by the quantum size effect ( qse ) in the hybrid system .    </S>",
    "<S> the bi / sb samples were fabricated @xmath3 by a sequential mbe deposition procedure as schematically illustrated in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the details are elaborated in the methods section . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the structure of the  add - on \" film in each step is optimized by annealing to an appropriate temperature to ensure film smoothness . </S>",
    "<S> the structural quality was examined by rheed and arpes . </S>",
    "<S> both sb and bi share a similar rhombohedral structure , which consists of slightly buckled honeycomb atomic layers stacked along the ( 111 ) direction . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the convention of calling the buckled layer a bilayer ( bl ) @xcite . on the ( 111 ) surface , </S>",
    "<S> the lattice constant of sb is 5@xmath4 smaller than that of bi . </S>",
    "<S> the bi(111 ) bl deposited on the sb(111 ) surface adopts the sb lattice constant and is thus laterally compressed , as verified by the unchanged rheed spot positions before and after the bi bl growth . </S>",
    "<S> the sizable strain makes our bi bl film quantitatively different from the bls studied previously , but this does not alter the nontrivial topological order according to our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic structure of the resulting bi / sb(111 ) system ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) is determined theoretically by optimizing the atomic coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical buckling within the bi bl is found to be 1.739 and 1.742 @xmath5 for 4 bl and 20 bl sb substrates , respectively , and the corresponding spacing between the bi bl and the sb surface layer is 2.621 and 2.600 @xmath5 , respectively . by comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the intra- and inter - bl distances for bulk sb(111 ) are 1.510 and 2.240 @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> right around the fermi level are two rashba topological surface bands that cross to form a dirac cone at the sbz center . </S>",
    "<S> the other bands at higher binding energies are qw subbands ; these are well resolved and correspond to a definitive film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this atomic - level film thickness uniformity is a prerequisite for the fabrication of precision quantum device structures . </S>",
    "<S> after bi bl deposition and subsequent annealing , the spectra changed dramatically [ figs . </S>",

    "<S> the topological electron - like surface states of sb disappear while a pair of hole - like rashba bands emerges in the sb valence band region . </S>",
    "<S> these newly emerged bands are derived from the bi states , which however hybridize with the sb qw subbands as evidenced by kinks where they cross ; an example of the kink is indicated by the arrow in each case . </S>",
    "<S> the hybridization makes the bi - derived states surface resonance states .    to further explore the nature of the bi - derived rashba states , we mapped the electronic bands with different photon energies . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in the results [ figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a - c ) and 3(g - i ) for the 4- and 20 bl sb substrates , respectively ] , the sb qw subbands do not disperse as a function of photon energy but undergo strong intensity variation . </S>",
    "<S> the subbands near the valance band maximum are more intense at 22 ev , but this maximum intensity region shifts toward higher binding energies as the photon energy increases to 28 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is typical for direct band transitions in the bulk @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> no prominent intensity variations are found for the bi rashba states as the photon energy varies ; this behavior is consistent with the surface character of these states .    </S>",
    "<S> our first - principles calculations of the band structure [ figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) and 3(j ) ] are in good agreement with the main features of the arpes data . </S>",
    "<S> the gray scale of the plotted bands indicates the projection of each state on the bi 6@xmath6 orbitals , which should simulate the arpes intensity because of a short photoelectron mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the bi - derived rashba states ( labeled bi1 ) are the most intense ones in the arpes data . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation also reveals another set of bi - derived states ( labeled bi2 ) at about 0.32 ev above the fermi level near the zone center . </S>",
    "<S> states bi1 and bi2 would be degenerate if the bi bl were freestanding @xcite , but become split in the present case because of interaction with the substrate . as shown in both arpes </S>",
    "<S> spectra and theoretical band structure , the outer part ( farther away from @xmath7 ) of bi1 band strongly hybridizes with the sb bulk state , losing its surface character , while the inner part remains tightly localized within the bi overlayer as evidenced by the bi atomic orbital projection in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) and 3(j ) . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure around the central crossing point of bi1 band resembles a massless 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) as denoted by the arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(j ) . the calculated spin texture of the band structure [ figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(f ) and 3(k ) ] indicates a very high degree of spin polarization close to 90% for states </S>",
    "<S> bi1 because of a very strong spin - orbit coupling in bi . </S>",
    "<S> this spinful 2deg on the surface of this hybrid structure can be an ideal platform for future surface - based spintronics .    </S>",
    "<S> a key feature of the calculated band structure for the case of the 4 bl sb substrate is an energy gap of about 36 mev in the band structure along the @xmath8 direction as highlighted in the zoom - in figure [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(e ) ] , where the gap is 0.32 ev above the fermi level as marked by two horizontal dotted lines . </S>",
    "<S> this gap lies very close to the bi - derived states bi2 which also shows strong spin polarization , and is consistent with the ti band gap of topmost bi bilayer as reported in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike all previous works , in our hybrid structure with 4bl sb substate there is no sb bulk state lying with this energy gap at least along @xmath8 , reflecting the suppression on bulk carrier by the quantum confinement effect . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the band structure for the 20 bl sb substrate [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(k ) ] shows no such gap because the sb qw subbands are more densely populated . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the system is metallic and can not support isolated edge conduction channels , and the same is true for even thicker sb substrates . </S>",
    "<S> so we see that decresing the sb - substrate thickness can reduce the hybridization between the functional overlayer and the substrate and , potentially , achieve an approximation of the desired properties of the freestanding overlayer system which , otherwise , can not exist alone in real materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the complete electronic band structure of the bi bl/4-bl sb(111 ) heterostructure is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> a gap , seen along the @xmath9 direction , arises from quantum confinement . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this is not an absolute gap , but a partial ( directional ) energy gap , as its energy range is traversed along the @xmath10 direction by two bands which are the rashba bands of the sb(111 ) surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these sb bands do not couple in @xmath11 space to bi2 band along the @xmath9 direction , which enable topological edge states to form within the gap . </S>",
    "<S> these edge states are further isolated from the other states by their spatial localization . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the topological edge states in the partial energy gap opened by the quantum confinement effect is confirmed by direct calculation for a bi bl nanoribbon made of 8 zigzag atomic chains on a 4 bl sb substrate ; an end cross - section view of the atomic structure is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall surface - weighted band structure and spin texture [ figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) and 4(c ) , respectively ] reveals a partial energy gap as marked by the dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> this gap , about 36 mev , is larger than the infinite - film case due to lateral quantization . </S>",
    "<S> the topological edge states are revealed by computing the edge - weighted band structure [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) ] . there is just one pair ( an odd number ) of edge states , as denoted by  </S>",
    "<S> a \" , within the gap on each edge , in agreement with the two - dimensional topological order of the bi(111 ) bl . </S>",
    "<S> ( the tiny splitting for each edge band is an artifact arising from the finite width of the ribbon and the resulting coupling between the two edges . ) </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spin texture [ figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(e , f ) ] confirms that this pair of edge states has their spin direction locked to the momentum direction in a chiral spin configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated charge density of a typical in - gap edge state a [ indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) ] reveals that this state is indeed localized at the edge of the bi ribbon within a decay length of about 2 atomic chains [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(g ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that even thought there still exist bulk state residuals with this energy range due to the partial opening nature of the gap , the edge states are isolated in both real and momentum spaces as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(f ) and 4(g ) , the scattering between the edge modes and the substrate bulk states is largely suppressed .    even though the topological edge spin channel is at 0.32 ev above the fermi level </S>",
    "<S> , one can make use of the protected edge conducting channel of the heterostructure by employing a gate bias in a device structure as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(h ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed structure involves a top metal gate , which is separated from the heterostructure by a high - k dielectric layer ( such as hfo@xmath0 ) . for the bi bl/4-bl sb(111 ) system </S>",
    "<S> , a shift of the fermi level by 0.32 ev corresponds to a charge accumulation of 0.6 electrons per surface unit cell or 3.8 @xmath12 electrons@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the required gate voltage is about 3 v for a dielectric thickness of 10 @xmath14 , which is well within the usual device operating range . by tuning the gate voltage </S>",
    "<S> one can switch into and out of the energy range where the topological edge modes contribute importantly and , thus , achieve a topological - edge - mode - based transistor . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the same fermi level tuning for the bi bl/20-bl sb(111 ) system would require a charge accumulation of about 4.5 electrons per surface unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> the required gate voltage would be  30 v , and dielectric breakdown would become a concern . </S>",
    "<S> the use of nanofilms is an important enabling feature for this application .    </S>",
    "<S> while 2d tis have been realized in several cases in the past , none has been found to simultaneously possess a sizable gap ( relative to the thermal energy at room temperature ) and edge modes that are electrically isolated from parallel non - topological conduction channels . </S>",
    "<S> our work shows a novel route to overcome the bottleneck thanks to the quantum confinement effect intrinsic to the quantum - well nanofilms . </S>",
    "<S> the system bi / sb is particularly promising because it can be made with atomic precision on standard si substrates as demonstrated by our experiment , which enables tuning the fermi level of the nanofilm readily and realizing novel devices like a topological - edge - mode - based transistor . as a possible further application of this 2d ti hybrid system </S>",
    "<S> , it would be interesting to synthesize it on top of a superconductor . because the total thickness of the bi bl plus 4 bl sb , less than 2 nm , can be much less than the superconducting coherent length for a properly chosen superconducting substrate , the topological edge modes could form cooper pairs as a consequence of proximity coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this system is a promising candidate for realizing one - dimensional topological superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we believe the methodology explored here offers a powerful approach to fabricate and control various nanoscale functional structures relevant to the development of next generation electronic devices . </S>"
