    "fourier transform power spectra of gas and stars in a variety of galaxies have shown power laws over a factor of @xmath6 in scale .",
    "this includes observations of local hi ( crovisier & dickey 1983 ; green 1993 ; dickey et al .",
    "2001 ) and co emission ( stutzki et al .  1998 ) , local hi absorption ( deshpande , dwarakanath , & goss 2000 ) , hi emission from the small ( stanimirovic et al . 1999 ) and large magellanic clouds ( elmegreen , kim , & staveley - smith 2001 ) , dust extinction in the small magellanic cloud ( stanimirovic et al .",
    "2000 ) , galactic nuclei ( elmegreen , elmegreen & eberwein 2002 ) , and optical light from nearby galaxies ( elmegreen , elmegreen & leitner 2003a ; elmegreen et al .",
    "other evidence for fractal structure in the interstellar gas comes from perimeter - area relations ( e.g. , falgarone , phillips & walker 1991 ) and box - counting methods ( e.g. , westpfahl et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the most likely cause of this scale - free structure is a combination of gravitational collapse , compressible mhd turbulence , and nested shells from multiple supernovae ( see review in elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "cluster formation and star formation occurs in the compressed regions ( see reviews in mac low & klessen 2004 ; klessen 2004 ) .",
    "although the technique of using fourier transform power spectra to analyze structure on galactic scales has been widely used , there has been no previous work on irregular ( i m ) galaxies outside the local group .",
    "availability of images in multiple passbands of a large sample of irregular galaxies ( hunter , elmegreen & van woerden 2001 ; hunter & elmegreen 2004 , in preparation ) now gives us the opportunity to carry this type of analysis to a larger number of i m systems .",
    "thus we undertook a study of the fourier transform power spectra of a sample of i m and blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies .",
    "the irregulars previously examined the lmc and smc ( stanimirovic et al .",
    "1999 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "2001)offer higher spatial resolution than our images , but our galaxies offer a more diverse sampling of the i m class .",
    "comparison of this sample to the lmc , smc , and spiral galaxies allows us to determine whether i m galaxies as a group are homogeneous and to examine similarities and differences with larger galaxies .",
    "spectra that follow a power law have resembled the power spectrum of velocity for kolmogorov turbulence in an incompressible medium .",
    "the reasons for this similarity are unknown ( see discussion in elmegreen , elmegreen & leitner 2003a ) .",
    "deviations from the kolmogorov spectrum in different galaxies may indicate different types of turbulent activity or excitation mechanisms .",
    "this paper presents fourier transform power spectra of one - dimensional linear cuts along the major axes of nine irregular galaxies .",
    "the data include v - band and h@xmath0  images and one h@xmath3imap . optical passbands give information about stellar structure with a large range of spatial scales ; h@xmath0  tracks the current star formation ; and h@xmath3i  shows the distribution of diffuse gas .",
    "the v - band and h@xmath0  images of our sample galaxies were obtained as part of a larger survey of the star - forming properties of 140 i m galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath0  observations are described by hunter & elmegreen ( 2004 ) .",
    "these images were obtained through narrow - band ( fwhm@xmath730  ) filters and a continuum - only off - band filter centered at 6440   with a fwhm of 95  .",
    "most were obtained using the perkins 1.8 m telescope at lowell observatory and an 800@xmath8800 ti ccd .",
    "large galaxies were imaged in multiple fields that were mosaicked into a single image .",
    "usually multiple images through the h@xmath0  filter and sometimes also through the off - band filter were obtained and combined to remove cosmic rays .",
    "the off - band image was shifted , scaled , and subtracted from the h@xmath0  image to remove the stellar continuum .",
    "the pixel scale ( given in table [ tab - properties ] ) for the h@xmath0  image of ddo 50 was 0.433and the rest were 0.488 .",
    "the final field of view of the h@xmath0  images was 5.5  for ddo 43 , ddo 88 , ngc 1156 , ngc 1569 , ngc 3738 , and viizw 403 .",
    "the field of view of the ddo 50 image was 9.7 ; for ddo 133 , 6.3 ; and for ngc 2366 , 12.5 .",
    "the resulting seeing ( fwhm of an isolated star ) on these images was 1.61.8  for ddo 43 , ddo 50 , ngc 1156 , and viizw 403 ; the rest had a seeing of 2.22.6 .",
    "v - band observations are described by hunter & elmegreen ( in preparation ) .",
    "the images of ngc 2366 are described in detail by hunter , elmegreen , & van woerden ( 2001 ) .",
    "most v images were obtained with the lowell observatory 1.1 m hall telescope using a site 2048@xmath82048 ccd .",
    "viizw 403 was observed at the perkins 1.8 m telescope , and images of ngc 1569 and ngc 2366 were obtained for us by p. massey using the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope and a tektronix 2048@xmath82048 ccd .",
    "several images were obtained of each galaxy with offsets of 2030  to improve the final flat - fielding .",
    "the electronic pedestal was subtracted using the overscan strip , and the images were flat - fielded using sky flats .",
    "foreground stars and background galaxies were edited out of the images and the background sky was fitted with a two - dimensional legendre function and subtracted .",
    "pixel scales are given in table [ tab - properties ] .",
    "the ngc 1569 and ngc 2366 v - band images , taken at kpno , had a pixel scale of 0.42 , a field of view of 14.3 , and a seeing of 1.7  and 2.2 .",
    "the image of viizw 403 , taken with the perkins 1.8 m telescope , had a pixel scale of 0.608 , a field of view of 4.8 , and a seeing of 2.1 .",
    "the rest of the galaxies , imaged with the hall 1.1 m telescope , had a pixel scale of 1.134 , a field of view of 17 , and a seeing of 2.83.4 .",
    "an integrated h@xmath3i  map of ngc 2366 was also analyzed .",
    "these data are a combination of vla c and d array interferometric observations ( hunter et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the map is a flux - weighted moment zero image made from the data cube .",
    "the beam size of the h@xmath3i  map is 33.6@xmath828.9 , and this represents the resolution of the map .",
    "the pixel size is 5 , and the map is 42.7  on a side .",
    "this map is sensitive to structures up to 15  in size .",
    "the center of the galaxy and position angle of the major axis are taken from hunter & elmegreen ( in preparation ) .",
    "they determined these parameters and the ellipticity of the galaxy from an outer contour of the v image block - averaged by factors of a few to increase signal - to - noise in the fainter outer parts .",
    "the center is simply the geometrical center of this outer isophote and the major axis is the longest bisector that passes through the center that , as much as possible , symmetrically divides the galaxy .",
    "a single center and major axis were used for all passbands of a galaxy .",
    "foreground stars and background galaxies were edited from the v - band images before surface photometry was performed in fixed ellipses that increase in semi - major axis length in approximately 10  steps .",
    "the surface photometry of the v - band image was fit with @xmath9 which represents an exponential disk and r@xmath10 is the scale - length of the disk .",
    "all of the galaxies discussed here show an exponential fall - off in v - band surface photometry , and the r@xmath10 are given in table [ tab - properties ] .",
    "table [ tab - properties ] shows a summary of the global properties of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "galaxies were selected based on their diverse sizes and star formation rates as well as their large apparent sizes relative to the pixel scale of the ccd .",
    "our choice of galaxies was also restricted to those that were not heavily resolved into point sources , which would have distorted the power spectra at high spatial frequencies .",
    "foreground stars and background galaxies in the images were removed using a routine that interpolates across a circle centered on the object being removed .",
    "the images were processed and transformed into power spectra using a combination of the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software package and a fortran program of our construction .",
    "the fits images were transformed into ascii arrays with values corresponding to the intensities of each pixel .",
    "the fortran program then extracted linear scans of the array along the major axes of the galaxy .",
    "ten strips were chosen parallel to the major axis of each galaxy and separated by one pixel .",
    "regularly - spaced points along each strip were taken to have intensity values equal to the values of the pixels in which the points lay , without interpolation .",
    "the regions over which the strips were taken are outlined on the v and h@xmath0  images in figure [ fig - strips ] and on the h@xmath3i  map of ngc 2366 in figure [ fig - histrip ] .",
    "exponential disks were removed from the v and h@xmath0  images by dividing each intensity strip by the average exponential profile : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the observed count in the @xmath13th pixel out to the sky limit , @xmath14 is the pixel number of the center of the galaxy , and @xmath15 describes the exponential fall - off of the disk ( determined at v - band ) . for the h@xmath3i  map we normalized with an exponential fit to the h@xmath3i  surface density radial profile . in figure",
    "[ fig - exp ] we show the result to one power spectrum of removing the underyling exponential disk .",
    "one can see that the exponential disk contributes to a steepening at higher relative spatial frequency .",
    "the choice of linear scans rather than azimuthal was influenced by the lack of obvious symmetry in many of the galaxies , as well as concerns that deprojecting the galaxy would introduce interpolation errors at high spatial frequencies .",
    "the linear scans suffer from edge effects , however , as dissimilar values at the two ends cause a broad erroneous response in the fourier transform . to remove these edge effects , a cosine taper with a length of 20 pixels",
    "was added to each strip end . when fitting the entire spectrum with a power law , tapering of the ends changed the overall slope by less than 0.1 for each image tested , mitigating an observed turn - up at the lowest @xmath16 .",
    "these lowest @xmath16 spatial frequencies were not considered in our final analysis since they reflect effects from galaxy disk gradients .",
    "several of the galaxies have sparse h@xmath0 and the linear cuts do not go through the brightest emission regions even though they go through the main part of the v - band emission .",
    "these cases also have noisy power spectra for h@xmath0 that do not show clear power laws .",
    "this situation leads to our eventual conclusion that the power spectrum of h@xmath0 emission resembles a kolmogorov power law wherever the filling factor of h@xmath0 emission is high enough to see the turbulent structure above the noise ; this tends to occur in the galaxies with the highest star formation rates per unit area .",
    "this conclusion is true even though other cuts , specially chosen for the faint cases , might show power laws over small regions .",
    "we considered taking 2d power spectra for our survey to include all of the emission , but then the edge effects become more prominent ( a high fraction of the area is at the edge ) and the sparse galaxies are still dominated by noise in 2d .",
    "our choice in the end was to be systematic rather than selective , taking major axis cuts over a broad swath ( 10 pixels wide ) to include as much of the emission as possible .",
    "fourier sine and cosine transforms were applied to the intensity strips , @xmath17    @xmath18    in these equations , @xmath19 is the total number of pixels in the intensity scan , given in table [ tab - n ] , and @xmath16 is the wavenumber .",
    "the power spectrum is computed by summing the squares of the individual sine and cosine transforms : @xmath20 the final power spectra used here are the averages of the power spectra obtained for each of the 10 scans along the major axis .",
    "the power spectra were plotted in log - log space as a function of their relative spatial frequency rsf=@xmath21 .",
    "the rsf is the spatial frequency normalized to the highest value that can be measured , @xmath22 .",
    "values of rsf=1 correspond to the smallest full sine wave of structure , having a wavelength of 2 pixels .",
    "( note that our convention is to include @xmath23 explicitly inside the argument of the sine and cosine functions , so wavelength is @xmath24 ) .",
    "linear fits to the average power spectra are taken for rsf between 0.03 and 0.8 .",
    "high @xmath16 is avoided because stars and other point sources contaminate the power spectrum there .",
    "seeing was generally 23  fwhm ( 23 pixels ) for the v - band images , corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "low @xmath16 is avoided because they are affected by galaxy gradients and the imposed cosine taper .",
    "the cosine taper has a wavelength of 40 pixels , and so contributes a small spike in the power spectrum at @xmath26 .",
    "power spectra for the 9 galaxies observed in v - band are shown in figure [ fig - vband ] .",
    "the lengths of the power spectra vary with the number of pixels in the strip .",
    "the spectra are offset from each other for clarity .",
    "sky noise is shown at the bottom .",
    "sky noise comes from 10 strips outside of ngc 2366 , which give an average slope of @xmath27 .",
    "all of the images have about the same sky power spectrum , with slopes varying by @xmath28 . the reference line in the lower left corner",
    "has a slope of @xmath29 , which would be the slope of the power spectrum for idealized kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the power spectra along the v - band major axes vary widely for our sample .",
    "we estimated the intrinsic variations by determining the power spectra of many strips with different position angles through the center of ngc 1156 .",
    "this is a round galaxy in the outer parts with no outstanding characteristics in any direction .",
    "the standard deviation of power spectrum slopes was 0.2 .",
    "differences in strip alignment and variations within a galaxy suggest the uncertainty in any individual slope is @xmath30 .",
    "we take this to be our uncertainty for all of the power spectra presented here .",
    "table [ tab - slopes ] gives the slopes of lines fit to the power spectra .",
    "the spectra of ddo 43 , ddo 50 , ngc 1569 , and ngc 3738 were determined by eye to roughly follow a two - part power law ; the `` fit division '' column gives the dividing point at which the two slopes were measured .",
    "`` low rsf '' are fits to the portion of the power spectrum less than the `` fit division '' rsf , while `` high rsf '' are fits to the portion greater than the division .",
    "ngc 2366 is fit most closely by a three - part power law ; both divisions are given in the second column .",
    "overall , the galaxies slopes divide into two groups : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "all slopes in the v - band are flatter than the kolmogorov value of @xmath33 .",
    "ngc 2366 and ngc 3738 have clear power laws with relatively few features .",
    "ddo 43 , ddo 50 , ddo 133 , and ngc",
    "1569 also have power laws but with more random deviations .",
    "the bump in ngc 1569 s spectrum at rsf@xmath34 is from the two super - star clusters near the center of the galaxy ( oconnell , gallagher , & hunter 1994 ; hunter et al .",
    "2000 ) ; when the clusters are removed , the bump disappears .",
    "ddo 88 , ngc 1156 , and viizw 403 have flat power spectra , resembling noise .",
    "the 10 individual spectra that went into these averages have larger deviations than they do for the other galaxies .",
    "viizw 403 has a two - part exponential disk with a steeper exponential in the center  not uncommon for bcds .",
    "however , ngc 3738 also has a two - part exponential disk and does not show the low frequency features of viizw 403 .",
    "ddo 88 has a relatively high sky - to - galaxy ratio in the image used .",
    "all three galaxies with flat power spectra are round and relatively homogenous in v. presumably these power spectra are measuring cluster and pixel noise in the images , rather than any large scale star formation patches .",
    "the power spectrum slope of the v - band images does not correlate with galaxy absolute magnitude m@xmath35 , central surface brightness @xmath36 , disk scale length r@xmath10 , or average surface brightness within r@xmath10 . to examine the importance of shear",
    ", we determined the radii at which the solid body parts of the rotation curves ended and normalized these radii to the disk scale lengths ( hunter et al .",
    "2001 ; simpson et al .",
    "2004a , b ; stil & israel 2002 ; swaters 1999 ; mcintyre 2003 ) .",
    "rotation curves of ddo 133 , ngc 3738 , or viizw 403 were not available .",
    "we found no correlation between the power spectra and these relative radii for shear .",
    "power spectra of h@xmath0  images also have a variety of shapes , as shown in figure [ fig - haband ] .",
    "the slopes are given in table [ tab - slopes ] .",
    "the average lengths of the h@xmath0  strips were larger by a factor of @xmath71.5 than the lengths for the v - band because the h@xmath0  pixels were smaller .",
    "power spectra of sky noise in the h@xmath0  images varied from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , with an average of @xmath39 .",
    "the sky noise shown in figure [ fig - haband ] has this slope and is from ngc 2366 .",
    "the relative scale for the power spectra of v - band and h@xmath0  are the same ; absolute power is not shown in figures [ fig - vband ] and [ fig - haband ] .",
    "the scale of distance relative to the rsf depends on the length of the major axis cut measured in pixels ; these are given in table [ tab - n ] .",
    "absolute sizes of individual features can be calculated using the original dimensions of the strip .",
    "power - law behavior is independent of the pixel size of the image .",
    "the large variety for the h@xmath0  power spectra is related to the great diversity of the h@xmath0  images .",
    "several galaxies , such as ngc 1569 and ngc 2366 , have many large h@xmath3ii  regions and steep power spectra , while others , such as ddo 88 and ddo 50 , have sparse h@xmath3ii  regions along the extracted strip and flat power spectra resembling noise .",
    "when the hii regions are sparse , other intensity strips that pass through individual emission regions could have been analyzed instead of the major axis strips used here .",
    "these emission regions are probably turbulent like most interstellar gas , and their power spectra might have shown the appropriate power spectra if they had enough spatial resolution , but here they contain far too few pixels to give sensible power spectra by themselves , and in 2d maps they are only a small fraction of the total structure , which is still dominated by noise in these cases .",
    "ngc 1569 follows a two - part power law with a ledge at rsf@xmath34 , corresponding to a scale of @xmath7190 pc . at low rsf ,",
    "the slope for ngc 1569 is @xmath40 and at high rsf the slope is @xmath41 .",
    "ngc 3738 also has a two - part power spectrum , with a slope at low rsf of @xmath42 and flat slope at high rsf .",
    "ngc 1156 has many large h@xmath3ii  regions and a relatively straight power spectrum with a slope of @xmath43 .",
    "it flattens at high rsf , presumably because of unresolved hii regions and pixel noise .",
    "the ngc 2366 power spectrum is dominated by the supergiant h@xmath3ii  region ngc 2363 in the se corner ; few other details in the power spectrum are visible .",
    "ddo 43 , ddo 50 , ddo 88 , and viizw 403 all have sparse h@xmath0distributions along the extracted strip and flat power spectra .",
    "the sources of ringing for ddo 43 and viizw 403 are unclear , as there are few h@xmath0  features . in general ,",
    "small h@xmath3ii  regions appear as point sources and contribute to the flattening of the spectra at high frequency .",
    "figure [ fig - ha_sfr ] shows that the power spectrum slope for h@xmath0  steepens with increasing star formation rate ( as obtained from hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "the exceptional case , ngc 2366 , would apparently have a steeper power spectrum without contamination from ngc 2363 .",
    "figure [ fig - hiband ] shows the power spectrum of h@xmath3i  from ngc 2366 .",
    "h@xmath3i  images were also available for ddo 43 and ddo 88 , but the number of pixels was too small to give a useful result .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 2366 follows a power law reasonably well for rsf@xmath44 , with a steep slope of @xmath45 for the 1d strip .",
    "the bump at rsf@xmath46 may result from a neutral cloud associated with the supergiant h@xmath3ii  complex ngc 2363 , or it may result from an hi ring seen in projection ( hunter et al .",
    "the hi strip passes through both the edge of ngc 2363 and one part of the ring .",
    "power spectra of h@xmath3i  strips in the lmc have a slope that is shallower than that for ngc 2366 by about 1 ( elmegreen , kim , & staveley - smith 2001 ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is not known .",
    "the lmc observation contains single beam data in addition to interferometric data , while ngc 2366 only has interferometric data .",
    "fourier transform power spectra of major axis cuts in v and h@xmath0-band images of a sample of 9 irregular galaxies were examined . on scales of @xmath47 pc ,",
    "6 galaxies have v - band power spectra with power law slopes of @xmath48 .",
    "this similarity suggests that the same processes are structuring star formation regions in these systems .",
    "three galaxies , which are all relatively round and indistinct , have flat power spectra similar to noise .",
    "the h@xmath0  images have power spectra with slopes that steepen for greater star formation rates .",
    "this is presumably the result of a greater angular filling factor for h@xmath0  at higher star formation rates , along with a near universal intrinsic power spectrum for h@xmath0  and other interstellar regions that is close to that for kolmogorov turbulence . at low h@xmath0  filling factors , the power spectrum is dominated by noise .",
    "an h@xmath3i  map of ngc 2366 yielded a power spectrum with a relatively steep slope , but this could be the result of low - frequency contamination by a giant hi ring and part of the giant hi cloud associated with ngc 2363 .",
    "differences between the v - band and h@xmath0 power spectra are usually the result of the influence of a few bright regions that show up in one band and not the other .",
    "these differences are to be expected for small galaxies where the number of emission regions is small and the age of each one differs . in larger galaxies",
    "there is a wider sample of structure at each age so particular regions do not stand out in the power spectra .",
    "even so , there could be a difference between v - band and h@xmath0 power spectra in large galaxies .",
    "if , for example , the largest regions form stars for the longest times and have the weakest h@xmath0 emission compared to optical ( i.e. , they have lower h@xmath0 equivalent widths ) , then the power spectrum for v - band would be steeper than for h@xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , the stars that make up the v - band could diffuse to a more uniform structure over time while the turbulence seen in h@xmath0 is always rejuvenated ; then the power spectrum for v - band would be shallower than for h@xmath0 .",
    "these possible differences are not expected to show up in small galaxies where a few individual sources dominate .",
    "power spectra give new insight into galactic structure .",
    "for images with a large number of pixels and few foreground stars , the power spectra of the azimuthal profiles and major - axis cuts are all approximately power laws when the emission is dominated by star formation .",
    "the power spectra resemble noise when the emission is dominated by old dispersed clusters and field stars .",
    "this result implies that star formation in the optical and h@xmath0  passbands is approximately scale - free , which means there is no characteristic mass or luminosity for ob associations and star complexes .",
    "the scale - free nature also implies that the gas processes leading to star formation are scale - free , as would be the case for gravitational instabilities ( semelin et al .",
    "1999 ) and turbulence compression ( elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "most likely a combination of self - gravity and turbulence structures the gas , triggering star formation .",
    "the driving force for the turbulence may be self - gravity as well , with a substantial contribution from supernovae and other young - stellar pressures . the fact that the power laws of star formation are about the same for dwarf galaxies and giant spiral galaxies suggests the microscopic processes are the same , independent of spiral density waves and galaxy size .",

    "<S> fourier transform power spectra of major axis cuts in v and h@xmath0images were made for a sample of 9 irregular galaxies . these power spectra reveal structure over a wide range of scales . for 6 of the galaxies </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum slopes at intermediate scales ( 10400 pc ) in the v - band images range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of slopes suggests that the same processes are structuring these systems . </S>",
    "<S> these slopes are slightly shallower than what is observed in other galaxies in h@xmath3i , molecular emission , dust extinction , and optical light . </S>",
    "<S> three of the galaxies have flat power spectra like noise from the sky ; these three galaxies are relatively indistinct in the direct images . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum slope for h@xmath0  steepens with increasing star formation rate , ranging from a shallow value comparable to the noise at low rates to a steep value with a slope of @xmath4 at high rates . </S>",
    "<S> this change reflects the increasing areal filling factor of h@xmath0  emission with increasing star formation rate , and an apparently universal slope inside the h@xmath0  regions that is comparable to that for kolmogorov turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum of hi in one galaxy has a steeper power law , with a slope of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the power laws of star formation are about the same for dwarf galaxies and giant spiral galaxies suggests the microscopic processes are the same , independent of spiral density waves and galaxy size . </S>"
