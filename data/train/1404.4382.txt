    "over the past decade and a half , there has been an intense interest in the theme of open systems featuring gain and loss due to numerous developments in the study of @xmath1-symmetric dynamics ; see e.g. @xcite . while the original proposal of such systems was given in the context of quantum mechanical ( non - hermitian , yet still potentially bearing real eigenvalues ) hamiltonians , relevant applications sprang in a number of diverse areas of physical interest . in particular , the analogy between the schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics and the paraxial propagation equation in optics led to such proposals in optics  @xcite which were subsequently realized in a series of experiments  @xcite .",
    "additionally , `` engineered ''",
    "@xmath1 symmetric systems also arose in the context of electronic circuits ; see the work of  @xcite and also the review of  @xcite .",
    "further developments including mechanical systems  @xcite and even whispering - gallery microcavities  @xcite have recently followed .",
    "the realization of @xmath0 symmetry in optical settings naturally brought forth the question of the implications of nonlinearity in such systems , as nonlinearity is rather ubiquitous in optics  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , led to the exploration of structures such as bright  @xcite and dark  @xcite solitons , two - dimensional generalizations of solitons  @xcite , as well as vortices  @xcite .",
    "generalizations of one - dimensional  @xcite and two - dimensional  @xcite such entities were predicted to exist as stable objects in dual - core couplers ( with the gain and loss being present in different cores ) .",
    "in addition , a large number of studies focused on the context of discrete systems in the setting of few sites ( so - called oligomers ) , as well as lattices  @xcite .",
    "the present work is in the spirit of oligomers and more specifically of dimers examined rather exhaustively in recent years both in experiments  @xcite and in theory  @xcite .",
    "however , it also fundamentally differs from these works , as it is _ not _ in the `` standard '' ( and rather delicate in its necessitated balance of gain and loss ) @xmath1-symmetric realm .",
    "instead , we seek to further explore a setting put forth in the recent , fundamental contribution of  @xcite , where an active medium with two waveguides , each contributing to the gain of the other is set forth , coupled with the intrinsic loss of each waveguide .",
    "while the resulting setting of  @xcite is not  @xmath1-symmetric , it is demonstrated that it features a robust feedback loop , which , in turn , generates stationary and oscillatory regimes in a wide range of gain - loss parameter values .",
    "additionally , the resulting system as written in the so - called stokes variables presents an intriguing proximity to the classical lorenz dynamical system which is a prototype of chaotic dynamics .",
    "indeed , the work of  @xcite revealed a sizable region of their two dimensional ( gain - loss ) parameter space exhibiting chaotic dynamics .",
    "our aim here is to present a general form of the relevant dimer system inter - twining the characteristics of ( a ) an active medium , ( b ) evanescent coupling , ( c ) intrinsic loss or imposed gain on each waveguide and finally nonlinearity ( of possibly even non - uniform type ) and to explore the situation for different types of combinations of these characteristics . in each of the cases considered",
    ", we explore the stokes variable formalism and rewrite the dynamical system as a 3 degree - of - freedom setup ( effectively removing an overall trivial phase , associated with the u@xmath2 invariance of the dimer ) .",
    "subsequently , we perform the `` local '' analysis of the system , identifying its fixed points and their spectral characteristics , as well elucidating the potential bifurcations ( pitchforks , hopfs , etc . ) .",
    "finally , we complement the theoretical analysis with direct numerical computations which illustrate prototypical dynamics of the respective cases .",
    "the presentation is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly present the general setup associated with our system . in section iii",
    ", we catalogue the relevant subcases and their theoretical ( fixed point , stability and bifurcation ) analysis , as well as the associated numerical computations .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our main findings and present a number of conclusions and directions for future work .",
    "we start by considering in the spirit of  @xcite the general dimer system for the evolution of two waveguides with variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 according to : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 play the role of the active underlying medium , which we will broadly conceive of as not necessarily symmetrically acting on the two waveguides ( although the latter is the canonical physical case ) . here , for mathematical purposes",
    ", we will also expand the realm of considerations to cases with @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath8 plays the role of the evanescent coupling between the waveguides and @xmath9 is the respective gain and loss imposed individually ( or intrinsically ) on each waveguide .",
    "finally , @xmath10 will represent the nonlinearity strength of the cubic kerr effect .",
    "for the latter , again motivated by physical cases of different material properties as e.g. in settings of the form of  @xcite , we will not a priori assume equal strength of the nonlinear prefactors .    in the following discussion",
    ", we will use the well - established stokes variables  @xcite @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . by also rescaling time as @xmath14 ,",
    "our dynamical equations can be rewritten as follows : @xmath15 we now let @xmath16 i.e. , the optical power , and thus @xmath17 ; notice that given this formula and the definition of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we can always express the above equations as a three - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "the differential equation for the evolution of @xmath19 reads : @xmath20 with conditions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath19 is exponentially increasing ( @xmath23 ) or decreasing ( @xmath24 ) , hence it is straightforward to establish instability @xmath25 or stability @xmath26 about the origin , which is the only fixed point .",
    "hence we focus more on systems where parameters do not satisfy these conditions .",
    "it is also interesting to note that if we write @xmath27 and @xmath28 , then the stokes variables can be expressed using @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , i.e. , the overall free phase due to the gauge invariance of the model is the dynamical variable that has been eliminated in this system .",
    "more specifically , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "based only on these three equations , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two similar variables ( playing the role of polar coordinates for the pair @xmath37 , while @xmath18 measures the intensity difference between the waveguides .    reversing the relevant transformation , @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "can also be obtained from stokes variables : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in what follows",
    ", we will solely consider the analysis of the three - dimensional dynamical system in the realm of stokes variables , bearing the above transformations and inverse transformations in mind .",
    "this is the case connecting to the earlier work including in @xmath0-symmetric settings where the medium is not active in that it does not induce a gain or loss related coupling between the waveguides .",
    "since @xmath41 automatically leads to @xmath21 , if we also assume equal gain or loss on two waveguides ( @xmath42 ) , the system is quite straightforward : the origin is the sole fixed point and it is either a stable spiral ( for @xmath43 ) or an unstable spiral ( for @xmath44 ) .",
    "also note that the stokes variable system bears an obvious reflection symmetry if @xmath45 is replaced by @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 ) or replacing @xmath48 by @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 ) .",
    "the system in this case reads : @xmath53 in fact , this is the well studied case of the @xmath0-symmetric dimer . for the latter",
    ", it is well known that it possesses two conserved quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and is hence integrable , possessing also the potential for periodic orbits .",
    "the ability of the system depending on the relative values of @xmath56 and @xmath8 to settle into periodic orbits or to escape to @xmath57 has been elucidated in a series of recent works  @xcite .    in this case , the differential equation @xmath58 does not provide direct dynamical information but solely an a priori bound to the growth of the system  @xcite . to better understand the dynamics , we reshape eqs .",
    "( [ eqn2a])-([eqn2b ] ) into a harmonic oscillator form  @xcite using the variable @xmath59 .",
    "then the solutions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants , determined by the initial conditions .",
    "these imply not only that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are always bounded , but also that @xmath63 is constant over time .",
    "thus , the dynamical system is actually two dimensional and any trajectory is constrained on the surface of a cylinder . by exploring the dynamics of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we can show that the density can become unbounded if the initial values are suitably chosen .",
    "besides , an example of explicit unbounded solution has been reported in  @xcite .",
    "the fixed points in this case are @xmath66 and @xmath67 for any non - negative number @xmath19 . since @xmath68 is not continuously differentiable at @xmath66 , interestingly , it is not straightforward to examine the jacobian matrix of the fixed point of the origin ( at the level of our stokes variable equations )",
    ". instead , in such a case it is advisable to return to the original dynamical system revealing that for @xmath69 the origin is a stable fixed point ( center ) , while the converse is true for @xmath70 ( saddle ) .",
    "the two additional families of fixed points correspond to the symmetric and anti - symmetric ( for @xmath71 ) states of the hamiltonian analog of the dimer which indeed collide and disappear in a saddle - center bifurcation at @xmath72 , as is well - known  @xcite for such  @xmath0-symmetric dimers .",
    "more generally , in this setting for @xmath69 , as is well - known , the trajectories may be bounded ( periodic ) or unbounded  @xcite , while for @xmath70 , they will be generically unbounded .",
    "this is an interesting case that to the best of our knowledge has not been explored previously . here",
    "the linear part of the system is @xmath0-symmetric , while the nonlinear part is _",
    "not_. the dynamical equations for the stokes variables in this case read : @xmath74 once again , the evolution of the power does not lead to unambiguous results since @xmath58 , but solely to an a priori bound for its maximal growth rate since @xmath75 ( and hence the maximal growth rate of the exponential growth of @xmath19 is @xmath56 ) .",
    "the origin is the sole fixed point in this case .",
    "the linearization around it is again not feasible at the level of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2c ] ) but can instead be realized at the level of eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) suggesting that the origin is a center for @xmath76 and a saddle point for @xmath77 .",
    "it is worth noting that the center here is no longer a center for a pure two - dimensional system , as was the case in the previous subsection and it , thus , does not necessarily imply the existence of a periodic orbit .",
    "a complementary perspective of this from the point of view of the stokes variables is that when @xmath78 , @xmath79 so that @xmath18 is always increasing or decreasing .",
    "notice that the same inequality can be used to infer the indefinite growth at the broken @xmath0-symmetry regime ( past the @xmath0-phase transition ) in the context of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2b ] ) .    by constructing the special function @xmath80",
    ", we can show @xmath81 so that @xmath82 is monotonic for nonzero @xmath56 .",
    "this confirms that the origin is the only fixed point .",
    "moreover , the system can not bear any periodic orbits . if it did , integrating @xmath82 along the orbit would never give zero , which is a contradiction to the integrated equation .",
    "therefore , even though this case has exactly the same linearization around the origin as the previous case a.2 , the dynamics there can be quite different , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2_c ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the present work , we have explored a series of generalized examples of the dimer system .",
    "our considerations involved a number of special cases such as the `` standard '' @xmath0 symmetric dimer  @xcite , the actively coupled optical waveguides of  @xcite for particular values of the parameters , as well as numerous cases that have not been previously considered , such as a @xmath0 symmetric variation of the actively coupled system or another variant which is @xmath0 symmetric at the linear level but nonlinearity destroys the symmetry . generally , we introduced and examined the possibility of not only having nonlinearly uniform waveguides but also waveguides constructed of different materials and hence with different ( here considered as opposite ) kerr coefficients .    in general ,",
    "this broad class of systems led to a wide range of interesting behaviors and bifurcation phenomena .",
    "in addition to analyzing the stability of the origin , we identified pitchfork bifurcations that gave rise to new fixed points , and hopf bifurcations that led to the emergence ( e.g. in the active medium case ) of limit cycles . moreover , chaotic dynamics was revealed in some of the cases .",
    "furthermore , various diagnostics including the use of stokes variables and of their dynamical systems analysis were brought to bear in order to characterize the dynamics of the different subcases .",
    "naturally , there are numerous veins for the extension of the present study . on the one hand , for one dimensional systems , it is quite relevant to extend these dimer settings to other oligomer cases , including examples of trimers  @xcite , quadrimers  @xcite and appreciate how the phenomenology observed herein is extended in this larger number of degrees of freedom cases . on the other hand , extending the relevant phenomenology to higher dimensions and plaquette type configurations as in the case of  @xcite would be another natural possibility in its own right .",
    "such possibilities are currently under active consideration and will be reported in future publications .",
