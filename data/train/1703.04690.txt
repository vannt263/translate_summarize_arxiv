    "this came as a surprise at the time , because it was previously assumed that the sea partons originate from the gluon splitting ( i.e. @xmath11 ) in a flavor - blind manner .",
    "since the perturbative calculation leading to @xmath12 difference is at the two loop level which is too small to explain the size of the difference  @xcite , it must have come from the intrinsic higher fock - space wavefunction of the nucleon , e.g. @xmath13 component .",
