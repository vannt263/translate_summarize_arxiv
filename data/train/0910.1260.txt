    "as was first suggested by refsdal ( 1964 ) , gravitationally lensed quasars can potentially provide an estimate of the hubble constant @xmath1 independent of any intermediate distance ladder .",
    "this can be made from measurements of the time delays between the quasar intrinsic brightness variations seen in different quasar images .",
    "the value of @xmath1 can be obtained then ( within the adopted cosmological model ) from the observed geometry of the system , with the known lens and source redshifts , and with the use of physically validated model of mass distribution in the lensing galaxy . since a phenomenon of gravitational lensing is controlled by the surface density of the total matter ( dark plus luminous ) , it provides a unique possibility both to determine the value of @xmath1 and to probe the dark matter abundance in lensing galaxies and along the light paths in the medium between the quasar and observer .    by",
    "now the time delays have been measured in about 20 gravitationally lensed quasars resulting in the values of @xmath1 , different for different quasars , while remaining noticeably less than the most recent estimate of @xmath1 obtained in the hst hubble constant key project with the use of cepheids - @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ( freedman et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is large enough and , if the hubble constant is really a universal constant , needs to be explained .",
    "a detailed analysis of the problem of divergent @xmath1 estimates inherent in the time delay method and the ways to solve it can be found , e.g. , in keeton & kochanek ( 1997 ) ; kochanek ( 2002 ) ; kochanek & schechter ( 2004 ) ; schechter ( 2005 ) .",
    "the quadruply lensed quasars , and pg1115 + 080 in particular , are known to better suit for determining the @xmath1 value as compared to the two - image lenses since they provide more observational constraints to fit the lens model .",
    "the pg1115 source quasar with a redshift of @xmath4 is lensed by a galaxy with @xmath5 ( henry & heasley 1986 ; christian et al .",
    "1987 ; tonry 1998 ) , which forms four quasar images , with an image pair a1 and a2 bracketing the critical curve very close to each other .",
    "it is the second gravitationally lensed quasar discovered over a quarter of century ago , at first as a tripple quasar ( weymann et al . 1980 ) .",
    "hege et al . (",
    "1980 ) were the first to resolve the brightest image component into two images separated by 0.48 arcsec .",
    "further observations ( young et al . 1981 ; vanderriest et al . 1986 ; christian et al .",
    "1987 ; kristian et al .",
    "1993 ) have provided positions of quasar images and information about the lensing object , which allowed to build a model of the system ( e.g. , keeton , kochanek & seljak 1997 ) . in particular , keeton & kochanek ( 1997 )",
    "have shown that the observed quasar image positions and fluxes and the galaxy position can be fit well by an ellipsoidal galaxy with an external shear rather than by a just ellipsoidal galaxy or a circular galaxy with an external shear .",
    "they noted that a group of nearby galaxies detected by young et al .",
    "( 1981 ) could provide the needed external shear .",
    "the problem of determining the hubble constant from the time delay lenses is known to suffer from the so - called central concentration degeneracy , which means that , given the measured time delay values , the estimates of the hubble constant turn out to be strongly model - dependent .",
    "in particular , models with more centrally concentrated mass distribution ( lower dark matter content ) provide higher values of @xmath1 , more consistent with the results of the local @xmath1 measurements than those with lower mass concentration towards the centre ( more dark matter ) .",
    "the time delays in pg 1115 + 080 were determined for the first time by schechter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to be @xmath6 days between b and c , and @xmath7 days between a1+a2 and c ( image c is leading ) .",
    "barkana ( 1997 ) re - analyzed their data using another algorithm and reported @xmath8 days for the time delay between b and c. there are also estimates of the time delays between images a1 and a2 made from the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories data ( dai x , et al .",
    "2001 , chartas et al .",
    "as is predicted by all lens models , it does not exceed a small fraction of the day , and equals @xmath9 days ( chandra data ) or @xmath10 days ( xmm - newton data ) .",
    "determination of the time delays has generated a flow of models for the system , ( schechter et al .",
    "1997 ; keeton & kochanek 1997 ; courbin et al . 1997 ; impey et al .",
    "1998 ; saha & wiiliams 2001 ; kochanek , keeton & mcleod 2001 ; zhao & pronk 2001 ; chiba 2002 ; treu & koopmans 2002 ; yoo et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; pooley et al .",
    "2006 ; miranda & jetzer 2007 ) , all illustrating how strongly the estimated value of @xmath1 depends on the adopted mass profiles of the lens galaxy for the given values of time delays .",
    "observations of pg 1115 + 080 have been carried out at the 1.5-meter telescope of the high - altitude maidanak observatory ( central asia , uzbekistan ) with a scientific brocam ccd camera . a site st005a 2030 x 800 chip provided an image scale of 0.26/pix at the f/8 focal plane .",
    "the ccd images were usually taken in series consisting of 2 to 10 frames for the @xmath0 filter and of 2 to 6 frames for @xmath11 and @xmath12 . to provide higher photometric accuracy",
    ", we averaged the values of magnitudes estimated from individual frames . the seeing varied from 0.75 to 1.3 ( the fwhm of images of the reference stars b and c according to designation by vanderriest et al . 1986 ) .",
    "the analysis of photometry shows no significant dependence of the photometry errors on seeing , excepting the fwhm noticeably exceeding 1.3 .",
    "occasional frames with such values of the fwhm were excluded from processing .",
    "the algorithm of photometric image processing is similar to that applied to photometry of q2237 + 0305 and described in great details in ( vakulik et al .",
    "the light curves of pg 1115 + 080a1,a2,b , c in filter @xmath0 for three observational seasons in 2004 - 2006 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the data sets consist of 23 nights in 2004 , 27 in 2005 , and 24 in 2006 .",
    "the data demonstrate noticeable variations of the quasar luminosity , with the total amplitude reaching almost 0.4 mag during a year ( between april 2004 and may 2005 ) .",
    "the time delays between the light curves of the c and b , c and a1 ( or a2 ) images can be easily seen from a simple visual inspection of the @xmath0 light curves . thus , our photometry in filter @xmath0 has immediately demonstrated applicability of the obtained light curves to determine the time delays . as compared to the data used by schechter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and barkana ( 1997 ) , we were lucky to detect the quasar brightness variations with an amplitude of almost a factor of three larger , and with rather well - sampled data points within every season of observations .",
    "in addition , the accuracy of our photometry has made it possible to confidently detect flux variations with an amplitude as small as 0.06 mag , that can be seen in the data of 2004 .",
    "also , recently published by morgan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) observations of pg1115 + 080 in filter @xmath0 during the same time periods in 2004 - 2006 should be mentioned here .",
    "we have made use of their photometry presented in their table 3 to compare with our light curves .",
    "variations of the quasar brightness which allowed us to determine the time delays are seen in their a1+a2 light curve quite well , but become undetectable in the b and c light curves because of a much larger scatter of the data points .",
    "the ideology of methods to determine the time delays between two image components from their light curves is simple enough and obvious .",
    "a common feature of all known methods of time delay measurements is the use , in one way or another , of the cross - correlation maximum or mutual dispersion minimum criteria , while the methods may differ in the algorithms of the initial data interpolation .",
    "analysis of the light curves of quasar images in pairs can be also applied when a lens consists of more than two images .",
    "but however , another approach seems to be more promising in this case .",
    "the model source light curve can be determined from a joint analysis of light curves of all image components .",
    "the individual time delays of the components are then determined with respect to this model source light curve jointly from a corresponding system of equations . in some cases ,",
    "this approach allows systematic variations in the light curves to be revealed and taken into account , such as those caused by , e.g. , microlensing . a similar approach described earlier by press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and rybicki & press ( 1992 ) and used later by barkana ( 1997 ) was also applied to determine the time delays in q2237 + 0305 ( vakulik et al .",
    "2006 ) .    as was noted above",
    ", a necessity to properly interpolate the unevenly sampled data points in the light curves under consideration is one of the main technical problems in determining the time delays .",
    "a variety of interpolating functions and algorithms is used , such as polynomials of various power , legendre polynomials , etc . in some cases",
    "the low - frequency splines provide good results .",
    "but unfortunately , all these interpolation procedures do not contain any physical meaning .",
    "meanwhile , the fourier spectra of quasar variability are known to be rapidly decreasing functions , ( de vries et al .",
    "2005 ) , and this is naturally explained by the finite physical sizes of quasars .",
    "in particular , the quasar size is known to play a role of smoothing factor in microlensing light curves , as is clearly seen from simulations .",
    "therefore , we tried to find such an algorithm to represent the source quasar light curve , which would take into account the expected frequency characteristics of the quasar variability and allow a relevant smoothing of the observational data . to do this",
    ", it was natural to address an expression that is well known in optics , radio engineering and theory of information as the sampling theorem . according to this theorem",
    ", a signal with a bounded spectrum can be represented accurately enough by a function : @xmath13,\\ ] ] here , the function @xmath14 is specified as @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are samples of @xmath17 taken at a mesh with a step @xmath18 , which is determined by a boundary frequency @xmath19 of the function @xmath17 spectrum : @xmath20 . since , as was noted above , fourier spectra of quasar variability are rapidly decreasing functions , we may apply the sampling theorem to reproduce the quasar light curve .",
    "we used this approach earlier to analyze statistics of microlensing brightness variations in q2237 + 0305 ( minakov et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the same algorithm was used in this work to represent the model for the source light curve . since the time delay between the light curves of images a1 and",
    "a2 is very short ( dai et al .",
    "2001 , chartas et al .",
    "2004 ) , their fluxes were summed to form a single curve , which we will call the a light curve .",
    "thus , we may write the following functional for three light curves : @xmath21 ^ 2}\\over {   \\sigma^2_j(t_i)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 are the data points in the light curve of the @xmath23-th image at the time moments @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the shifts of corresponding light curves in stellar magnitude and in time , @xmath27 is a number of points in the light curves , @xmath28 are the photometry errors , and finally , @xmath29 is an approximating function ( 1 ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath30 and @xmath31 in our calculations , that is , we fitted the light curves of the two other images to the a light curve , and thus , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the magnitude differences a - b and a - c , respectively . at given values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we minimize @xmath36 in @xmath25 and in coefficients @xmath37 of the sampling function .",
    "the values of minimum of @xmath38 were being looked for at a rectangular mesh @xmath39 with a step of 0.5 days in preliminary calculations , and of 0.2 days at a final stage .",
    "the values of @xmath39 corresponding to the minimal value of @xmath36 , were adopted as the estimates of the time delays @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the time delay @xmath42 is not an independent quantity in our method , and can be determined as a linear combination @xmath43 .",
    "having calculated the time delays , we analyzed deviations @xmath44 of light curves of each image from the approximating function : @xmath45    we revealed a linear trend in deviations of the a light curve , and small parabolic trends for images b and c. we interpreted these trends as the effects of microlensing , which are expected to be rather slow and weak .",
    "we then subtracted a half of these trends from the initial light curves of the components , obtained new estimates of the time delays , and analyzed the residual trends again .",
    "this procedure continued iteratively until the trends became insignificant .",
    "the final estimates of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are obtained with the linear trend 0.0105 mag / year subtracted from the image a light curve , and with the parabolic trend with the amplitude of @xmath46 mag subtracted from the b and c light curves .",
    "thus , our estimates of the time delays are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 days , with the relationship @xmath50 , more consistent with that determined by barkana ( 1997 ) than by schechter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    to evaluate the errors of estimating the time delays and reliability of our estimates",
    ", we fulfilled a numerical simulation .",
    "we selected a function @xmath51 used to approximate our light curves with @xmath52 yr , as a model source light curve .",
    "the model light curves of the components were obtained by shifting @xmath51 by the proper time delays @xmath39 and magnitude differences , and by adding some random quantities to imitate the photometry errors .",
    "the estimates of these errors were obtained from the analysis of deviations of the observed data points from the approximating function resulting in the values of standard deviations 0.008 , 0.016 and 0.011 mag for images a , b and c , respectively . since the method we used might be susceptible to the mutual locations of data points in the actual light curves , we selected the model samples exactly at the same time moments as in the actual light curves .",
    "we simulated two cases : @xmath53 and @xmath54 days as determined by schechter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 days ( our result ) .",
    "we simulated 2000 random light curves synthesized as described above , and calculated the resulting time delays using the procedure , which was exactly the same as in the analysis of the actual light curves .",
    "admitting that we could be mistaken in selection of the nyquist interval , we fulfilled the model calculations with a more low - frequency function of the source brightness variations ( @xmath57 years ) .",
    "no systematic biases larger than 0.3 days in the estimates of simulated time delays @xmath34 and @xmath35 were revealed in both cases .",
    "the results of simulations were used to estimate the 95-percent confidence intervals .",
    "it is interesting to note that using only the data of 2004 , where a small - amplitude turn - over in the light curves is detected , we obtained @xmath58 , @xmath54 , and @xmath59 days , consistent with the estimates obtained from the whole data set .",
    "but however , simulation of errors for only this time interval demonstrates noticeably larger uncertainties , as compared to those calculated from the whole light curve .    in fig .",
    "2 , the light curves of images a , b and c shifted by the corresponding time delays and reduced to image a in magnitude are shown for the approximating function parameter @xmath57 years .",
    "as is seen , the data points for all the three images are very well consistent with each other and with the approximating curve , ( a behavior of the approximating function within the gaps between three seasons of observations should be ignored ) .",
    "so we obtained the time delay values , differing noticeably from those by schechter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and barkana ( 1997 ) , which are used in a variety of models of many authors to derive the hubble constant value .",
    "calculation of new lens model or recalculation of some most popular ones to derive the new estimate of the hubble constant would be well beyond the scope of the present short communication .",
    "we would just note that the new values of time delays reported in this work must result in higher values of @xmath1 as compared to those obtained with the previous time delay values for pg1115 + 080 , thus decreasing a well - known diversity between the time - delay method of determining the hubble constant and other methods .",
    "the authors from ukraine and uzbekistan are grateful to the science and technology center in ukraine ( stcu grant u127 ) which had made possible observations at the maidanak observatory and the further working on the data .",
