    "in particular , optical elements can be integrated into the trap to improve state detection .",
    "ion qubit state - detection relies on efficient collection of laser - induced ion fluorescence @xcite .",
    "measurement times for high - fidelity readout are set by the collection efficiency , frequently limited by a small light collection solid - angle .",
    "an advantage of fast qubit measurement times is more effective control of quantum states @xcite with applications to quantum error correction protocols @xcite and measurement - based quantum computers @xcite .",
    "increased light collection may also be useful for entangling distant ions by photon interference @xcite , provided sufficient spatial coherence exists between the collected photons for efficient single - mode fibre coupling .",
    "as the system size is increased , it will be necessary to detect the states of multiple ions simultaneously in order to keep operation times low .",
    "with current bulk - optics systems , optimizing the light collection from a single ion can restrict the field of view ( fov ) , thus limiting the ability to perform parallel measurements .",
    "several methods for scalable state detection have been investigated , such as direct coupling to optical fibres @xcite , microfabricated fresnel optics @xcite , and optical cavities .",
    "recently , surface - electrode traps have been fabricated directly on a planar mirror , resulting in two ion images @xcite .",
    "the largest collection efficiency thus far has been demonstrated with a macroscopic three - dimensional spherical mirror trap @xcite .",

    "the design consists of a surface - electrode paul trap with an integrated reflective mirror component for improved photon collection .",
    "the surface trap is mounted on a cpga carrier and placed in an ultra - high vacuum chamber ( figure [ experiment]a ) . a radio - frequency ( rf ) potential applied to a pair of rail electrodes confines the ions radially ( figure [ experiment]b ) .",
    "axial confinement is achieved by biasing a subset of the 42 independent dc control electrodes which lie along the rf rails adjacent to the trapping region .",
    "typical trapping potentials utilize five electrodes per side to generate harmonic wells with secular frequencies between 0.5 and 2 mhz . by slowly varying the potentials applied to the control electrodes ,",
    "a trapped ion can be smoothly transported to distinct regions of the device , including to regions that contain specialized structures for efficient state readout .",
    "an approximately spherical micromirror directly integrated into the central dc electrode reflects a large na cone of fluorescence from an ion near the focus .",
    "any mirror misalignment or deviation from an ideal profile results in a divergent cone of light .",
    "the alignment of the optical focus and the ion is entirely the product of design and microfabrication of the trap and is not sensitive to thermo - mechanical misalignment .",
    "a macroscopic relay optic is placed outside the vacuum chamber to collect and focus fluorescent light onto a detector . in this role , rather than imaging the ion ,",
    "the relay lens images the micromirror onto the detector . as such",
    ", the relay lens spot size is only required to match the selected detector size , making it simple to design and assemble .",
    "the relay optics are designed to be tolerant of misshaped and misaligned micromirrors .",
    "furthermore , this multi - scale light collection system can direct light from a multitude of micromirrors distributed across a large fov to independent detectors .      for compatibility with vlsi fabrication techniques @xcite",
    ", we consider only designs in which no electrode edges are patterned inside the micromirror and where the electrode forming the mirror surface is grounded .",
    "we estimate the solid - angle coverage provided by the mirror and its dependence on the electrode configuration by examining two analytical models in the gapless plane electrostatic approximation @xcite : a ring trap geometry which enables a high collection efficiency of reflected photons and a linear - strip electrode geometry compatible with ion shuttling .",
    "these models represent the design extremes ; features of both designs are combined in a hybridized wrapped - electrode geometry which is numerically optimized to minimize the influence of the mirror on the pseudopotential tube .",
    "first , consider a trap geometry where the mirror is surrounded by a narrow rf ring electrode .",
    "neglecting the depression of the mirror cavity ( mirror sag ) , we use the gapless plane electrostatic approximation to calculate the inner radius of the rf rail @xmath3 ( equal to half the mirror diameter ) as a function of the ion height @xmath4 above the trap surface @xmath5^{1/2 } , \\ : 0 < \\theta < \\pi/6,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is proportional to the angular width of the rf electrode as seen from the ion ( see @xcite )",
    ". we immediately note that the collection angle @xmath7 does not depend on the mirror shape or size .",
    "the upper bound ( @xmath8 , corresponding to an rf electrode with an infinitesimal width ) gives @xmath9 ( na = 0.82 , 21@xmath10 geometric collection efficiency ) .",
    "for a reasonable but small rail angle , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( na = 0.76 , 18@xmath10 geometric collection efficiency ) .",
    "these analytic results neglect the effect of the micromirror depression on the fields .",
    "the influence of the micromirror on the trapping fields will lower the ion height and is therefore expected to somewhat improve the collection efficiency . moving any portion of the rf rails away from the mirror will raise the ion height , therefore the insertion of small isolation gaps between electrodes as required for real traps will reduce collection efficiency .",
    "while the maximum collection efficiency is achieved with a surface ring trap , we require a mirror compatible with a scalable architecture that allows for the shuttling of ions .",
    "figure [ mirror_design]a shows an example of such an architecture in which the mirror is tangent to the rf rails of a linear section . in this design , any ion in the linear section may be transported over the mirror for readout . once again using the gapless plane electrostatic approximation",
    ", we find the relationship between the ion height and mirror radius for this configuration , @xmath13 again , @xmath14 is a function only of the rf electrode angle , and the radius of curvature ( roc ) of the mirror is linearly proportional to the ion height .",
    "the upper bound for the mirror acceptance angle , @xmath15 , is again found when @xmath16 ( na = 0.71 , 15@xmath10 collection efficiency ) . for a reasonable rail angle , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( na = 0.66 , 12@xmath10 geometric collection efficiency ) .",
    "figure [ mirror_design]b shows a concept for a hybrid of the two analytic models that improves the collection efficiency by wrapping the rf rail around the mirror .",
    "we choose a conservative design , with a target ion height of 63 @xmath19 m , @xmath20 , and a @xmath21 wrapping of the rf rail around the mirror .",
    "approximate values of the mirror roc ( 150 @xmath19 m ) and radius ( 60 @xmath19 m ) were found from the above analytic forms after including a 6 @xmath19 m gap around the edge of the rf electrodes and a 4 @xmath19 m flat shelf around the edge of the mirror .",
    "the resulting optimal micromirror sag is 12 @xmath19 m and the na is 0.69 ( geometric collection efficiency 14@xmath10 ) .",
    "these parameters represent an idealized target geometry for fabricated micromirrors .",
    "errors in microtrap fabrication may lead to significant deviations in the mirror profile .",
    "we performed numerical simulations on these candidate designs using our own method - of - moments electrostatics code .",
    "similar methods were used to optimize trapping electrode geometries . starting with the design in figure [ mirror_design]b ,",
    "the rf rail width was adjusted until the mirror focus was aligned with the pseudopotential null ( 17 @xmath19 m rail width ) while keeping the inner edge of the rail and mirror profile constant .",
    "next , the spacing between the rf rails in the linear section was optimized so that the ion height over the linear section approximately matched the height in the mirror .",
    "a pinch in the rf electrodes was inserted at the transition region between the linear and wrapped rail geometries ( figure [ mirror_design]c ) to reduce variation in the ion height .",
    "this adjustment did not change the location of the rf null over the mirror .",
    "finally , a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the rf rail geometry near the wrapping region .",
    "the algorithm uses a fitness function that minimizes the rf - noise motional heating rate @xcite while maintaining a nearly uniform ion height down the linear section .",
    "the fitness function is proportional to @xmath22 ^ 2 dz$ ] , where @xmath23 is the applied electric field and the contour @xmath24 follows the pseudopontential minimum along the axial coordinate @xmath25 .",
    "perturbations to the rail geometry are parametrized by a set of edge points which are systematically displaced from the input geometry .",
    "a spline function was used to interpolate the rf rail edge between these points .",
    "the optimizer was allowed to adjust the number of points and the distance of the points from the axial centre line of the trap , under the constraint that the width of the rf rail was held constant and the rf null location was maintained within 0.25 @xmath19 m of the mirror focus .",
    "the resulting optimization produced several candidate solutions .",
    "the solution with the fastest decline in the rf field along the trap axis was selected for fabrication .",
    "this design is shown in figure [ mirror_design]d .       11 mm@xmath26 trap chip with minimal cross - talk between detectors . for clarity ,",
    "the trap electrodes have not been drawn and only a small number of mirrors were included .",
    "the micromirrors are not drawn to scale . ]",
    "an important component of the multi - scale detection system is the macroscopic relay lens assembly . in a proposed trap design with an array of mirrors ,",
    "the relay lens directs light reflected from each micromirror site located to an independent sensor ( e.g. , a single element in a pmt or apd array ) in the image plane , allowing independent , asynchronous readout for each mirror ( see figure [ multiscale ] ) .",
    "the required complexity of the relay optic depends on the mirror spacing in the ion trap and the required insensitivity of the system to misalignment .    to illustrate the simplicity and robustness of this approach ,",
    "a 1:1 , na = 0.14 relay lens was designed using 2  diameter stock plano - convex lenses in a commercial optics simulation package ( zemax ) .",
    "a full technical description of the relay lens , including ray - tracing simulations , is provided in the supplemental materials . in the simulations , a spherical mirror matching the ideal target geometry",
    "is placed at the object point of the relay optic .",
    "the optic is designed so that light collected from each measurement region is focused onto independent 0.25 mm radius detectors in the image plane .",
    "individual micromirrors distributed anywhere on the @xmath27 mm@xmath26 chip are resolvable with zero cross - talk so long as no two mirrors are placed closer than @xmath28 mm centre - to - centre .",
    "this distance corresponds to six dc control electrode widths in the current trap ( see figure [ experiment]b ) .",
    "mm ) are provided .",
    "( b ) cross - talk ratio ( fraction of collected light that reaches the image plane outside of the detector radius ) versus mirror displacement from the relay optic axis .",
    "the ratio is an upper bound on the cross - talk ; in practice the actual cross talk will be smaller .",
    "the calculation includes rays directly emitted by the ion and assumes 85% mirror reflectivity with negligible transmission losses . ]     from a mirror centre .",
    "the reflected ray distribution is calculated for mirrors at field heights 0 mm and 8 mm .",
    "the position of the detector is not adjusted to compensate for misalignment of the ion to the mirror .",
    "( b ) spot radii for vertical ion displacements along the @xmath29 axis from the vertex of a mirror located on the relay lens axis . ]",
    "to estimate the tolerance of the light collection system under various misalignments , we calculate the distribution of directly emitted and specularly reflected rays projected onto the detector plane .",
    "we consider transverse displacements of the micromirror from the optical axis of the relay lens ( field height ) . in figure",
    "[ optics - tolerance1]a , we show that for mirror displacements exceeding the dimensions of the trap chip the light specularly reflected by the micromirror forms a localised spot less than 0.25 mm in radius in the image plane ( the lens does not vignette any light reflected from the mirror ) .",
    "the image plane is assumed to be distortion free .",
    "that is , if the mirror is placed 8 mm from the axis of the relay lens , the detector is placed 8 mm from the axis in the opposite direction .",
    "photons directly emitted by the ion are not well collimated and may arrive at one of several detectors , introducing a cross - talk error during state detection .",
    "the relay optics have been designed to reduce this effect .",
    "figure [ optics - tolerance1]b shows that for all transverse mirror displacements within the chip dimensions , light from an individual ion relayed by the lens may be collected by a single 0.25 mm radius detector with a cross - talk of less than 0.05% .",
    "therefore , the designed multi - scale detection system is efficient for mirrors placed anywhere within the design fov of the relay lens . note that larger , denser arrays of micromirrors are possible as fast",
    ", high fidelity readout is still possible with non - negligible cross - talk @xcite .",
    "we also consider misalignments of the ion relative to the micromirror either in the transverse @xmath30-@xmath31 plane ( e.g. , the ion is not centred on the optical axis ) or longitudinally ( e.g. , the mirror roc is incorrect , the mirror sag is incorrect , or the rf rails are incorrectly sized ) .",
    "the magnitudes of these misalignments are bounded by the characteristic errors from trap fabrication .",
    "we conservatively estimate the transverse misalignment to be less than 4 @xmath19 m and the mirror sag error to be less than 3 @xmath19 m .",
    "nondestructive measurement of the micromirror profile outside na = 0.3 is not currently possible , leading to uncertainty in the longitudinal alignment of the mirror focus with the rf null .",
    "however , it is possible to accurately measure the sag of the mirror and post - select a chip that is closest to the design objective ( within 1 @xmath19 m ) .",
    "in figures [ optics - tolerance2]a - b the specularly reflected spot radius is plotted as a function of transverse and longitudinal misalignment .",
    "we find that the design performance of the collection system is not degraded for misalignments within the expected fabrication tolerances .",
    "finally , we note that increased fov , improved misalignment tolerances , and other detector sizes and configurations may be accessible by redesign of the relay lens .",

    "since the fabrication of the prototype described here , substantial progress has been made in the production of smoother mirror surfaces , and we expect to build mirror surfaces with @xmath59 nm in the near future . with improved fabrication , we believe it is feasible to produce an integrated micromirror with greater than 85% reflectivity at @xmath60 nm , which collects @xmath61 of emitted photons into a cone of fluorescence . for a trap with an 85% surface reflectivity , we estimate the collection efficiency of the system when coupled to the relay optic used in the experiment ( na @xmath62 0.43 , fov @xmath63 0.25 mm ) to be 17% over the mirror , and 9% over a planar region ( @xmath64 enhancement ) .",
