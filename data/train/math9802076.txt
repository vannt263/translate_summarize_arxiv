    "the lie algebra @xmath2 has a current realization that is given by three current operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for @xmath2 ,",
    "when we consider the case of bosonization of the current operator , the operators @xmath3 and @xmath5 can be decomposed in the following way : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are operators that commute with @xmath4 and @xmath8 are vertex operators generated by the heisenberg algebra of @xmath4 .",
    "these two operators @xmath7 are called parafermions .    for the quantum affine algebra @xmath1 , which is a q - deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath2 , drinfeld presented a loop realization of affine quantum groups with current generators",
    "this , for @xmath1 , gives us the quantized current operators corresponding to @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 of @xmath2 , which are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to the positive and negative half of @xmath4 respectively . for @xmath1 ,",
    "similarly when we consider the case of bosonization of the current operator , the operators @xmath9 and @xmath13 can be decomposed in the following way : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are operators that commute with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath16 are vertex operators generated by the heisenberg algebra of @xmath10 , @xmath11@xcite@xcite@xcite .    for a given affine lie ( super ) algebra @xmath17 ,",
    "there exist different ways to construct the associated w - algebra , which is an extended conformal algebra .",
    "one is the well - known sugawara construction of casimir type .",
    "another is the drinfeld sokolov reduction .",
    "there is also another type of construction coming from the description of the associated w - algebra as the algebra generated by the current operators which commutes with the screening operators associated to @xmath17 .",
    "this is evident for the case @xmath18 , where the construction produces the virasoro algebra .",
    "the key idea is to consider the screening operators associated to the root of @xmath19 in terms of bosonization , then we try to find the simplest current operators that commute with those screen operators also in terms of bosonization .",
    "it turns out that it also gives a w - algebra .",
    "such a construction was first quantized for the case of virasoro , which gives us the quantized virasoro algebra@xcite for the case of @xmath20 , such a construction is also utilized in the case of constructing quantized w - algebra associated to @xmath21@xcite .",
    "recently , following the idea of the description of quantum w - algebra using the quantization of screening operators @xcite , we derived the quantized w - algebra of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the generator of this algebra @xmath22 is bosonized as a sum of three vertex operators , while the screening operators are a set of two fermions or a set of one quantized screening operators of @xmath23 and a fermion .",
    "for these two different sets of screen operators , they actually produce equivalent @xmath22@xcite , where @xmath24 is given as an uniquely determined operator that commutes with the two screening operators up - to a total difference .",
    "we see clearly @xcite , in terms of the description of one quantized screening operators of @xmath23 and a fermion , the degeneration of the two screen operators , when q goes to 1 , are exactly the screening operators associated to the lie super algebra @xmath25 .",
    "this is the reason the algebra generated by @xmath22 is called the quantized w - algebra of @xmath0 .",
    "the degeneration of this operator @xmath22 , when q goes to 1 , still commutes with the screening operators , and gives us the associated w - algebra of @xmath0 .",
    "it is known in mathematics as a folklore that there is connection between the w - algebra corresponding to the lie super algebra @xmath25 and these two parafermions .",
    "namely that in the operator product expansion of @xmath26 , one of the components gives us a realization of the w - algebra of @xmath0 , namely if we look at the bosonized @xmath26 s components in terms of product expansion , the corresponding component commutes with two fermions , which is equivalent to the screening operators of @xmath0 , which are equivalent as shown in @xcite for the quantized case .    in this paper , we will use the bosonization formulas in @xcite to establish again the connection between the quantized w - algebra of @xmath0 and the two quantum parafermions .",
    "we show that the operator @xmath24 can be identified with the operator @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 is the central element or say level and the contour c is around the point @xmath29 .",
