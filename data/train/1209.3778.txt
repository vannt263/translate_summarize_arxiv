    "the theory of the hierarchical assembly of the milky way ( mw ) from smaller structures @xcite has enjoyed wide observational support in the past two decades .",
    "the ongoing disruption of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite provided dramatic evidence for presently active hierarchical merging .",
    "@xcite discovered tidal tails around the globular cluster palomar  5 , indicating that both galaxies and clusters participate in the stellar conglomeration .",
    "perhaps most strikingly , the sloan digital sky survey has permitted the discovery of numerous tidal streams @xcite along many different lines of sight .",
    "the ubiquity of these merger events makes it clear that the mw halo is still being formed and that its constituents are many small objects composed of both stars and dark matter .",
    "much of the study of the merging process concerns the precise nature of the building blocks .",
    "one test of the nature of the halo is its chemical similarity to smaller objects .",
    "the advent of 810  m telescopes permitted the first detailed chemical analyses of stars in mw dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) .",
    "@xcite discovered that the detailed abundance patterns of stars in dsphs did not agree with stars of similar metallicity in the inner halo .",
    "therefore , the surviving dsphs can not be identical to the primary constituents of the inner halo .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed a solution to the chemical discrepancy .",
    "the inner halo was not built from galaxies like the surviving dsphs .",
    "instead , it was built from galaxies closer in stellar mass and gas content to dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "cosmological simulations showed that the inner halo was built very early by massive satellite galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the surviving dsphs are small galaxies that formed stars inefficiently .",
    "also , they have had over 10  gyr to alter their stellar populations , including their chemical compositions .",
    "the surviving dsphs and their siblings are currently participating in the construction of the outer halo , which spans a much longer duration than the rapid assembly of the inner halo .    in the past few years , several studies have attempted to discern whether galaxies like the surviving dsphs can contribute the most metal - poor stars to the mw halo .",
    "the search for chemical consistency was driven by the desire to find a source for the most metal - poor stars in the halo .",
    "@xcite claimed that the dsphs are free of stars with @xmath5 } } < -3 $ ] based on line strengths of the infrared triplet .",
    "however , @xcite discovered such stars in the mw s ultra - faint dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "several studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) established the similarity between these stars abundances and those of the halo .",
    "a subsequent , corrected analysis of the triplet metallicity distributions of classical dsphs has uncovered extremely metal - poor stars @xcite , and new extremely metal - poor stars have now been discovered in the classical dsphs using other spectroscopic methods @xcite .    despite the general agreement , some discrepant abundance patterns persist between the dsphs and the halo .",

    "* k10 ) measured the abundances of thousands of red giants in eight mw dsphs from medium - resolution spectroscopy",
    ". some of these are both very metal - poor and bright enough for high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "we selected two of the most interesting stars in this sample .",
    "one of the stars is in the sculptor dsph , and , according to @xcite , it is magnesium - enhanced ( @xmath6 } = + 0.69 \\pm 0.16 $ ] ) .",
    "the other is in the ursa minor dsph , and it is extremely metal - poor ( @xmath5}}= -3.62 \\pm 0.35 $ ] ) . in order to verify these interesting abundances and to measure the abundances of many elements not accessible to @xcite s study , we obtained keck / hires @xcite spectra of both stars .",
    "the details of some of our measurement and analysis methods are somewhat new .",
    "therefore , we spend much of this article describing our procedures .    in section  [ sec : obs ] , we describe our hires observations and data reduction . in section  [ sec : ew ] we describe our technique for measuring absorption line strengths and their uncertainties . section  [ sec : abund ] details our method for estimating abundances and uncertainties from the line strengths .",
    "we interpret our measurements in section  [ sec : discussion ] and summarize our work in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "targets were selected from @xcite s catalog of medium - resolution spectroscopic abundance measurements .",
    "this catalog contains fe , mg , si , ca , and ti abundance measurements from spectral synthesis of keck / deimos @xcite observations .",
    "the sample of 2961 stars is unbiased with respect to metallicity , and it reaches far down the red giant branch ( @xmath7 ) in eight mw dsphs .",
    "however , the limited spectral range and resolution of deimos restricts the precision of the abundance measurements and the number of elements that can be measured .",
    "therefore , we selected one metal - poor star in each of two dsphs from the catalog for high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up to reveal whether the abundance pattern of this star is consistent with similarly metal - poor stars in the mw halo and other dsphs .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] gives coordinates , photometry , and observational details for all of our targets .",
    "in addition to scl  1019417 and umi  20103 , we included in our study two metal - poor abundance standards previously observed with hires by j.  cohen : hd  115444 and hd  122563 . because our equivalent width measurement technique differed from cohen s previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we re - analyzed these spectra to demonstrate the validity of our abundance measurements . the @xmath8 magnitude for hd  115444",
    "was taken from the tass mark  iv survey @xcite , and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 magnitudes were taken from 2mass @xcite .",
    "all of the photometry for hd  122563 was taken from @xcite .",
    "we configured hires optimally for faint , metal - poor red giants .",
    "for the program star observations , we used the red cross - disperser with a spectral range of 39278362   .",
    "the slit width was 1.15  , and the slit length was 7  , the maximum length that disallows overlap of the bluest orders .",
    "the spectral resolution depends primarily on the slit width . when the seeing is smaller than the slit width , and the guiding is good , the spectral resolution is smaller than that corresponding to the projected width of the slit . therefore , the spectral resolution was better for umi  20103 than for scl  1019417 , which suffered from the poor seeing at an airmass of @xmath11 .",
    "the spectrograph was configured differently for the abundance standards than for the program stars because the abundance standards were observed under programs with different science goals .",
    "the slit width for hd  115444 was only 0.4  .",
    "the ultraviolet cross - disperser was used for hd  122563 .",
    "the reddest wavelength for this spectrum is just 5993   , but our line list includes few lines beyond that wavelength .    the spatial axis of the hires ccds is oversampled , with a plate scale of 0.12  per pixel .",
    "therefore , we binned the detector readout by two pixels in the spatial axis .",
    "we did not bin the dispersion axis .",
    "the dispersion is about 0.020    per pixel at 5138   .",
    "the next section describes the use of daospec to measure equivalent widths .",
    "two products of daospec are the fwhms of absorption lines and the residual spectrum , after all absorption lines have been subtracted .",
    "we measured the spectral resolving power by calculating the median of the wavelengths of all lines measured with daospec divided by their fwhms .",
    "we measured the snr of each spectrum by calculating the standard deviation of pixels between 5700    and 5800    in the residual spectrum .",
    "the snr per pixel is the inverse of this quantity . to convert to snr per resolution element",
    ", we multiplied by the square root of the number of pixels occupied by the fwhm of weak absorption lines near 5750   .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] lists spectral range , resolving power , and snr .",
    "the resolution of spectral features is limited by the stellar macroturbulence .",
    "@xcite showed that red giants typically have a macroturbulence of @xmath12  km  s@xmath13 , corresponding to a maximum resolving power of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the narrower slit used for hd  115444 does not ensure that stellar features will appear at the instrumental resolution , @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , the measured resolving power for this star is @xmath16 .",
    "taking into account the spectrograph s line spread function , we estimate that the macroturbulence for this star is 7  km  s@xmath13 , consistent with @xcite s ( @xcite ) relations .",
    "in addition to science exposures , we also obtained exposures of a thorium - argon arc lamp , a quartz flat lamp , and bright stars to trace the echelle orders along the detector .",
    "we reduced the raw frames into one - dimensional spectra using the hires data reduction software makee . with no user input",
    ", this pipeline subtracts the bias level , flat fields the images , extracts a single one - dimensional spectrum for each echelle order along the traces determined from the trace star , and finds the wavelength solution  including the heliocentric correction  from the arc lamp exposure .",
    "we modified makee slightly to interpolate over bad columns in the second - generation hires ccd mosaic , installed in 2004 .",
    "some spectral regions were observed on two or three blue echelle orders .",
    "there were gaps of up to 46    between the reddest echelle orders .",
    "we ran makee on each exposure individually . for the final spectrum",
    ", we added together all of the one - dimensional spectra for a single object .",
    "makee also provides a @xmath17 error spectrum for each exposure .",
    "we constructed a final error spectrum by adding together the individual error spectra in quadrature .",
    "makee determined the wavelength solution from a sixth - order polynomial fit .",
    "daospec ( section  [ sec : ew ] ) required a linear wavelength scale .",
    "therefore , we linearly rebinned the spectrum for each order .",
    "confidence intervals on the ews based on line fits to different monte carlo realizations of the spectra .",
    "the @xmath18 upper limit on the ew for  @xmath19 in umi  20103 is shown as a dotted red line.[fig : specexamples ] ]    figure  [ fig : specexamples ] shows a small region ( 51905202   ) of the hires spectra for the two program stars .",
    "a comparison between the two spectra shows the lower snr of umi  20103 .",
    "it is also clear that umi  20103 has weaker metal absorption lines than scl  1019417 .",
    "the weaker lines are due mostly to the higher effective temperature and partly to the lower metallicity of umi  20103 .",
    "we measured equivalent widths ( ews ) in each spectrum using daospec @xcite .",
    "this program automatically determines the continuum shape , absorption line centers , and line strengths .",
    "first , daospec iteratively fits and subtracts saturated gaussian profiles ( as discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the observed spectrum",
    ". then , it fits a polynomial to the residual flux .",
    "we chose a polynomial order of 20 .",
    "the program detects additional lines in successive iterations , and it terminates when the residual spectrum is consistent with flat noise .",
    "this procedure is particularly adept at measuring the ew of each component of partially blended lines .",
    "the data products are the continuum shape , residual spectrum , radial velocity , and a line list , including central wavelengths , line widths , and line strengths .",
    "each echelle order has its own instrumental response function and consequently its own continuum shape .",
    "therefore , we ran daospec on each echelle order independently .",
    "we forced the resolving power ( @xmath20 ) to be constant with wavelength , as is appropriate for echelle spectrographs .",
    "daospec cross - correlates the list of detected lines with the user s list .",
    "our line list was identical to that of the keck pilot project @xcite .",
    "we determined the radial velocity for each star by examining the difference between the measured line centers and the predicted line centers from the line list .",
    "each line gave an independent measurement of the radial velocity . in table  [ tab : obs ] , we quote the mean and the error on the mean of all of the radial velocity measurements for each star .    although daospec reported the ew for almost every line in the line list , some lines required manual intervention .",
    "we built a graphical user interface , called hiresspec , in idl to display hires spectra and measure ews .",
    "hiresspec shows the linearized spectra of all echelle orders divided by the continuum polynomial previously determined by daospec .",
    "each line from the line list is marked with the responsible elemental species .",
    "if daospec successfully measured the line s ew and fwhm , then hiresspec shows the corresponding saturated gaussian profile .",
    "if daospec failed to measure a line s ew , which happened rarely , then the user may request that hiresspec fit a saturated gaussian to the line .",
    "the fwhm of the line is fixed based on the spectrum s constant resolving power ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "hiresspec uses the levenberg - marquardt minimization code mpfit @xcite to determine the ew .",
    "if a line is not detected above the noise , the user may request hiresspec to estimate an upper limit . to do this",

    "the rms is given for three groups : lines that @xcite  measured to be less than and greater than 100  m  and all lines.[fig : wes00_ew ] ]    figure  [ fig : wes00_ew ] compares our ew measurements with those of @xcite , who also observed hd  115444 and hd  122563 .",

    "these are the primary causes for discrepancy between the two sets of ew measurements .",
    "our saturated gaussian fits are not perfect representations for the hires line spread profile .",
    "the profile is complex due to the nature of the instrument and , for longer exposures , changes in seeing during the night .",
    "we compared the ews computed from saturated gaussians to ews computed from direct summation for lines at a variety of strengths in both hd  115444 and hd  122563 .",

    "this result suggests that our saturated gaussian fits underestimate the true ews .",
    "our error estimates ( section  [ sec : error ] ) required an automated method of determining the spectral continuum and measuring ews .",

    "low [ ba / fe ] ratios in extremely metal - poor stars in classical and ultra - faint dsphs have also been noted by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the ratios of these neutron - capture elements to each other ( figure  [ fig : ncap ] ) do not appear particularly discrepant , except perhaps for the low upper limit on [ la / ba ] in scl  1019417 .",
    "we suggest that the origin for these deviations is the metallicity dependence of these elements sn yields .",
    "the production of na in type  ii sne depends sensitively on the neutron excess , which depends on the initial metallicity of the exploding star @xcite .",
    "lower metallicity sne produce lower [ na / fe ] ratios .",
    "the metallicity dependence of sn yields can explain the distribution of light elements in the mw bulge @xcite .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the yields of neutron - capture elements is less clear .",
    "however , the @xmath2-process seems to consist of at least two components : the main @xmath2-process , which produces the full range of atomic number , and the weak @xmath2-process , which produces elements lighter than ba @xcite .",
    "( also see @xcite  @xcite and @xcite  @xcite . )",
    "( * ? ? ? * their section  5.8.2 ) summarized the relation of the multiple components of the @xmath2-process to the observed abundances of extremely metal - poor stars in dwarf galaxies .",
    "although the metallicity dependence of the yields of @xmath2-process elements is not well - understood , at least one potential source of the @xmath2-process  the lighter element primary process @xcite  is expected to occur only in low - metallicity stars .",
    "therefore , it is conceivable that the @xmath2-process yields have some metallicity dependence .",
    "the inner halo progenitors were presumably massive galaxies @xcite that began their lives with a great deal of gas . as a result",
    ", the first sne did not enrich the galaxy very much .",
    "consequently , the abundance patterns seen at , say , @xmath5}}= -2.5 $ ] are reflective of sne with metallicities only slightly less than @xmath5}}= -2.5 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the surviving dsphs are small and dark matter - dominated .",
    "the gradual inflow of gas at early times @xcite ensures that the first sn will pollute a small amount of gas . as a result",
    ", a single sn can enrich the entire protogalaxy to as much as @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gap between a sn s metallicity and the metallicity of the stars that formed from its ejecta is larger than in the massive inner halo progenitors .",
    "the abundance pattern of a star at @xmath5}}= -2.5 $ ] in a small dsph could reflect the yields of a sn with @xmath5}}= -3 $ ] or even lower .",
    "therefore , the metallicity - dependent rise of na and the @xmath2-process elements is deferred to stars with higher [ fe / h ]  in the dsphs than in the more massive halo progenitors .",
    "our suggestion is related to @xcite s ( @xcite ) conclusion that metallicity - dependent yields caused the evolution of [ mn / fe ] in the sagittarius dsph to differ from the mw bulge . whereas our suggestion involves the metallicity dependence of the type  ii sn yields of na and possibly the neutron - capture elements at @xmath5 } }",
    "< -2 $ ] , @xcite s explanation concerns the metallicity - dependence of the type  ia sn yield of mn at @xmath5}}\\sim -1 $ ] . also , our hypothesis explains the different abundance patterns between the dsphs and the mw as a result of different masses of the star - forming gas polluted by sne .",
    "in contrast , @xcite theorized that the difference is a result of the slower chemical evolution of sagittarius compared to the mw bulge .",
    "we emphasize that the abundance patterns of very metal - poor stars in dsphs do not lie outside of the boundary defined by halo stars .",
    "rather , some abundance ratios lie on or near the boundary .",
    "therefore , some very metal - poor stars in the high - resolution halo samples , which are heavily biased toward the inner halo , likely came from galaxies very similar to the surviving dsphs .",
    "other very metal - poor halo stars with higher [ na / fe ] and [ @xmath176/fe ] ratios came from different types of galaxies .",
    "if our suggestion concerning the metallicity - dependence of massive sn yields is correct , then these stars came from galaxies more massive that the surviving dsphs .",
    "alternatives to metallicity - dependent yields include inhomogeneous mixing @xcite and mass - dependent yields coupled with stochastic sampling of the initial mass function ( d.  lee et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "from keck / deimos medium - resolution spectroscopy , @xcite discovered several very metal - poor red giants in the mw dsphs .",
    "we observed two of these ( one in sculptor and one in ursa minor ) at high - resolution with keck / hires .",
    "we measured the detailed abundances of these stars . because one of them is faint ( @xmath177 ) , we paid careful attention to the abundance uncertainties introduced by poisson noise in the spectrum .",
    "we measured the abundances from 100 different noise realizations of the spectra .",
    "this approach required automated ew measurements . in order to check the accuracy of our results",
    ", we applied the same technique to two well - studied halo abundance standards .",
    "we found that our measurements were consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "our high - resolution measurements roughly confirm the deimos values for [ fe / h ] , although the hires measurement of [ fe / h ]  for umi  20103 is 0.46  dex ( @xmath152 ) higher than the deimos value .",
    "the hires metallicites are [ @xmath0 } = -3.16 $ ] for umi  20103 and [ @xmath0 } = -2.40 $ ] for scl  1019417 .",
    "we also confirmed the deimos measurements of [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios in scl  1019417 , although the hires [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios are slightly lower than the deimos measurements .    the abundance patterns of these two stars support previously established trends .",
    "in particular , the elemental abundance pattern of very metal - poor dsph stars is largely consistent with very metal - poor mw halo stars .",
    "however , certain element ratios ( [ na / fe ] , [ zn / fe ] , [ ba / fe ] , [ la / fe ] , and [ ce / fe ] ) in sculptor and ursa minor lie only at the lower envelope of abundance ratios defined by inner halo stars .",
    "we suggest that the earliest sne in dsphs pollute a smaller gas mass than the earliest sne in the inner halo progenitors . as a result , the metallicity dependence of sn yields defers the rise in these ratios to higher metallicities in the dsphs than in the inner halo .",
    "this explanation affirms that objects identical to the surviving dsphs were not the building blocks of the inner halo , which formed roughly 10  gyr ago .",
    "instead , the surviving dsphs and objects like them are actively building the outer halo .",
    "@xcite showed that the outer halo is chemically distinct from the inner halo .",
    "therefore , the two entities must have had different formation mechanisms , even at the lowest metallicities . @xcite",
    "modeled the distribution of [ fe / h ]  and [ @xmath1/fe ]  in the different spatial and kinematic components of a mw - like halo . a fair test of",
    "the hierarchical model would be to compare their predicted abundance patterns to observations of the outer halo , not to compare surviving dsphs to the inner halo .",
    "we anticipate that future missions such as gaia @xcite will settle this issue permanently .",
