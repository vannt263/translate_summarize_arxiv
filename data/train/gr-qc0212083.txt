    "a new generation of gravitational wave detectors ( ligo , virgo , etc ) are now working to detect gravitational waves from compact objects , such as black holes and neutron stars .  with this detection",
    "we expect to have a unique probe of the physics that dictates their behavior .",
    "this is ushering in a new era where strong - field relativistic effects will play an increasingly important role .  only through their inclusion",
    "can we hope to accurately decipher what gravitational wave data will have to tell us .  with that in mind",
    ", we present here a fully relativistic model of the so - called entrainment effect ( to be described in some detail below ) that is a necessary feature of the dynamics of superfluid neutron stars .    for the densities appropriate to neutron stars",
    "there are attractive components of the strong force that should lead , via bcs - like mechanisms , to nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "indeed , calculations of supra - nulcear gap energies consistently lead to the conclusion that superfluid neutrons should form in the inner crust of a mature neutron star , with superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons in the core .",
    "even more exotic possibilities have been suggested , such as pion condensates , superfluid hyperons , and superconducting quark matter .",
    "perhaps most important is the well - established glitch phenomenon in pulsars the best description of which is based on superfluidity and quantized vortices .",
    "superfluidity should affect gravitational waves from neutron stars by modifying the rotational equilibria and the modes of oscillations that these objects support @xcite .",
    "the success of superfluidity in describing the glitch phenomena is due in part to the fact that the superfluid neutrons of the inner crust represent a component that can move freely ( for certain timescales ) from the rest of the star .  explaining the glitch phenomena then becomes a question of how to transfer angular momentum between the various `` rotationally decoupled '' components .  for the modes of oscillation ,",
    "it is by now well established that a similar `` decoupling , '' this time between the superfluid neutrons of the inner crust and core and a conglomerate of the remaining charged constituents ( e.g.  crust nuclei , core superconducting protons , and crust and core electrons ) , leads to a mode spectrum for superfluid neutron stars that is quite different from that of their ordinary fluid counterparts ( see @xcite , and references therein , for a complete review ) .",
    "several recent studies @xcite have established that the entrainment effect is an important element in modelling the rotational equilibria and modes of oscillation of superfluid neutron stars .",
    "sauls @xcite describes the entrainment effect as a result of the quasiparticle nature of the excitation spectrum of the superfluid and superconducting nucleons .",
    "that is , the bare neutrons ( or protons ) are accompanied by a polarization cloud containing both neutrons and protons .",
    "since both types of nucleon contribute to the cloud the momentum of the neutrons is modified so that it is a linear combination of both the neutron and proton particle number density currents , and similarly for the proton momentum .",
    "thus when one species of nucleon acquires momentum , both types of nucleons will begin to flow .    in the core of a neutron star",
    ", the fermi energies of nucleons ( as well as some of the leptons ) can become comparable to their mass - energies , because the fermi energies are a function of the local particle number densities , and these can be quite high .",
    "this implies that any newtonian model for entrainment must become less reliable as one probes deeper into the core of a neutron star , and thus a relativistic formulation is required .",
    "in fact , we will see that the newtonian parameterized model of prix et al .",
    "@xcite does deviate most from the relativistic model in the core .",
    "there are two purposes for which a relativistic formulation is necessary .  at the microscopic level ,",
    "the nucleons will ( locally ) have average speeds that are comparable to the speed of light .  as well , at a mesoscopic level , the fluid elements , which contain a large number of nucleons , could have average speeds that are also comparable to the speed of light .  the formalism that we develop here will be relativistic in both respects .",
    "one should note , though , that in realistic astrophysical scenarios ( e.g.  when an isolated neutron star undergoes linearized oscillations , or a pulsar exhibits a glitch ) the fluid element average speeds are typically only a few percent of that of light .    to date",
    ", studies of superfluid dynamics in neutron stars have relied on models of entrainment that are obtained in the newtonian regime .",
    "for instance , a few of the most recent studies @xcite have employed a parameterized model for entrainment that is inspired by the newtonian , fermi - liquid calculations of borumand et al .",
    "an alternative formulation @xcite  motivated by mathematical simplicity that allows for analytic solutions for slowly rotating newtonian superfluid neutron stars  for parameterizing entrainment has been recently put forward .  here",
    "we take a different approach , and this is to use a @xmath0 relativistic mean field model , of the type that is described in detail by glendenning @xcite .",
    "although a relativistic fermi - liquid formalism exists @xcite , we prefer to use the mean field model because it is sufficiently simple that semi - analytical formulas result , and a clear connection between the coupling parameters at the microscopic level can be made to the macroscopic properties ( such as mass and radius ) of the star .",
    "an immediate consequence is the ability to compare the relativistic entrainment model with the two parameterized models .",
    "we will see that the model used by prix et al .",
    "@xcite , although limited , is a better fit than the other formulation .",
    "the next section begins with a review of the @xmath0 model .",
    "that is followed by an application of the mean field approximation to obtain an equation of state that includes entrainment .  in sec .  3",
    ", we briefly review the general relativistic superfluid formalism and how it is used to describe slowly rotating configurations .",
    "we then use the mean field results to produce explicit models .",
    "after some concluding remarks , an appendix is given that contains some of the technical details and results .   throughout",
    "we will use `` mtw '' @xcite conventions , a consequence of which is that several equations will have minus sign differences with , for instance , those of @xcite .",
    "to create a seamless conceptual basis for general relativistic calculations of dynamic processes in neutron stars , we need a covariant formalism that describes the strongly interacting coupled neutron and proton fluids",
    ".  it should be sufficiently simple that it provides physical insight , yet accurate enough that it can serve as the basis for realistic numerical calculations .  for static stars ,",
    "this role is played by the @xmath0 effective mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "our task in this paper is to generalize this theory to dynamic stars .",
    "in particular , we are interested in situations where there is relative motion of the two fluids , since the entrainment of one by the other turns out to play a large role in the dynamics .    the lagrangian density for the baryons and the mesons that the baryons exchange is as in the static case .",
    "it is   @xmath1with@xmath2as the baryon lagrangian .",
    "here @xmath3 is an 8-component spinor with the proton components as the top 4 and the neutron components as the bottom 4 .",
    "the @xmath4 are the corresponding @xmath5 block diagonal dirac matrices .",
    "the lagrangian for the @xmath6 mesons is @xmath7the lagrangian for the @xmath8 mesons is @xmath9where @xmath10  the interaction lagrangian density is@xmath11the euler - lagrange equations are@xmath12finally , the stress - energy tensor takes the form t^ = t_b^ + t_^ + t_^+t_int^ containing contributions from the baryons @xmath13 , the mesons @xmath14 , and the interaction .",
    "individually , these are @xmath15    we now solve these equations in the mean field approximation , eventually in a frame in which the neutrons have zero spatial momentum while the protons have on average a wavevector @xmath16  in this approximation we ignore all gradients of the averaged sigma and omega fields , and the neutrons and protons are taken to be in plane - wave states .",
    "the problem simplifies considerably and we find for the @xmath6 and @xmath17 fields and the stress - energy tensor @xmath18 that @xmath19 ^ 2\\right )       \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu } - i \\left\\langle \\bar \\psi \\gamma^{\\mu }       \\partial_{\\nu } \\psi \\right\\rangle \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for later convenience , we have introduced the notation @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the dirac effective mass @xmath22 , i.e. g _ = m - m _ *  .",
    "restricting to the zero - momentum frame of the neutrons leads to a set of algebraic equations for the @xmath17 field:@xmath23the final equation is not needed in the case where both neutrons and protons have zero average momentum , since @xmath24 then vanishes by isotropy .  in this case",
    ", the neutrons and protons have a common rest frame and @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the baryon number densities of the neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "the addition of the spatial velocity component complicates the solution of the problem considerably , in part because there is no longer a common rest frame for all the baryons .",
    "each expectation value on the rhs of these equations involves an integration over the fermi spheres of the particles , whose radii can be shown ( c.f .  the next section ) to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the zero - component of the conserved neutron ( proton ) number density current @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the proton fermi surface is displaced by @xmath34 .",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath35 , but the expressions for general @xmath36 are not more complicated than the power series expansion .    noting that @xmath37 \\psi \\right\\rangle = 0\\]]we find@xmath38where we have dropped expectation value brackets for the mean values of the fields .",
    "the energy @xmath39 of a baryon in a plane - wave state is given by@xmath40thus we see that @xmath41 contributes a constant shift , @xmath42 gives a preferred frame for the momenta , and @xmath6 renormalizes the mass to the dirac mass .",
    "as an example of how the expectation values are evaluated , we give the scalar density ( letting @xmath43 , for ease of notation):@xmath44and the average four - velocity components of the baryons : @xmath45thus we have reduced the problem to a set of nonlinear equations for the @xmath46 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 fields that must be solved numerically .  this can be done for any set of the input parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the interaction and mass parameters for the effective fields have been determined from nuclear physics , and they are discussed further below .",
    "once this is done , we still need expressions for the stress - energy tensor , which is the input for the einstein equations .",
    "again , specializing to the zero - momentum frame of the neutrons , the only non - zero stress - energy tensor components are@xmath50some of the expressions have been simplified using the equations of motion .",
    "each component of @xmath51 again involves an integration over the fermi surfaces , but now in terms of completely known parameters .",
    "for example , to determine @xmath52 , we need@xmath53 \\left [      \\left(\\vec{k } + g_{\\omega } \\omega^{z } \\widehat{z}\\right)^{2 } +       m_*^{2}\\right]^{- 1/2 } + \\cr      & & \\cr      & & \\frac{2}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } \\int_{|\\vec{k}| < k_{\\p}}d^{3}k      \\,\\,\\left[k_{z } + k\\right ] \\left[k_{z } + g_{\\omega } \\omega_{z }       + k\\right ] \\,\\left[\\left(\\vec{k } + g_{\\omega } \\omega^{z }       \\widehat{z } + k \\widehat{z}\\right)^{2 } + m_*^{2}\\right]^{- 1/2 }       \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath54 | ^0 k_z = _ || < k_d^3kk_z + _ || < k_d^3k ( k_z + k ) = k^3_3 ^2 k  .",
    "the main result of this section is thus a well - defined prescription for producing the functions @xmath55 .  in the next section",
    "we take this prescription and produce from it the so - called master function , including entrainment , that is used in the general relativistic superfluid field equations .",
    "the formalism to be used here , and motivation for it , has been described in great detail elsewhere @xcite , and so we will review only the highlights .",
    "the central quantity of the superfluid formalism is the master function @xmath56 .",
    "it depends on the three scalars @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 that can be formed from the conserved neutron ( @xmath60 ) and proton ( @xmath61 ) number density currents .",
    "furthermore , the master function is such that @xmath62 corresponds to the total thermodynamic energy density if the neutrons and protons flow together ( as measured in the comoving frame ) .",
    "once the master function is provided the stress - energy tensor is given by t^_= ^_+ ^_+ ^ _  , where = - n^_- p^_[press ] is the generalized pressure , and @xmath63 are the chemical potential covectors .",
    "we also have = - x^2  , = -2 n^2  , = -2 p^2  . the momentum covectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 are dynamically , and thermodynamically , conjugate to @xmath66 and @xmath67 and their magnitudes are the chemical potentials of the neutrons and the protons , respectively .",
    "the two covectors also make manifest the entrainment effect ; that is , we see that the momentum of one constituent ( @xmath64 , say ) carries along some of the mass current of the other constituent ( @xmath64 is a linear combination of @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "we can also see that there is no entrainment unless the master function depends on @xmath70 .",
    "the field equations for this system take the form of two conservation equations for the neutrons and protons , i.e. _ ^ = 0 , _ ^ = 0  , which is a reasonable approximation given that the weak interaction timescale is much longer than the dynamical timescale of neutron stars for small amplitude deviations from equilibrium @xcite , and two euler equations , i.e. ^ _ [ _ ] = 0 , ^ _ [ _ ] = 0  , where the square braces means antisymmetrization of the enclosed indices .",
    "the two scales that enter this problem are the microscopic , on the scale of the nucleons , and the mesoscopic where one speaks in terms of the two interpenetrating superfluids .",
    "the fundamental `` particles '' at the fluid level are the fluid elements which contain , say , an avogadro s number worth of nucleons .",
    "the connection between the micro- and meso - scopic levels is via the averaged stress - energy components calculated earlier .  consider a fluid element deep in the core of the neutron star and orient the local coordinate frame in such a way that the z - axis of the frame is in the same direction as the proton momentum with respect to the neutrons .",
    "as shown just below , a unique combination of the averaged stress - energy components determined via the mean field theory will yield the master function .  as this quantity is a scalar , the functional relationship we obtain between @xmath56 and the two particle number densities and the relative velocity of the protons with respect to the neutrons",
    "can then be applied anywhere in the star .",
    "the key idea is to use the ( local ) relationship t^ _ = ^ _ + ^_+ ^ _ to obtain @xmath56 .  in the perfect fluid case ,",
    "the identification is made immediate by the fact that there is only one four - velocity @xmath71 for the system , and hence a preferred rest - frame for the particles .",
    "the local energy density of the fluid is thus uniquely obtained from @xmath72 .  in the superfluid case",
    "there are two four - velocities , and thus no preferred rest - frame .",
    "fortunately , we can still obtain @xmath56 in a unique , and covariant , way , by using the trace @xmath73 and the three scalars that can be formed from contracting @xmath51 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , i.e.  @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "we thus find that @xmath56 is given by = - 1 2 t + 3 2 ( x^4 - ^2 ^2)^- 1 ( ^2 ^2 - x^2 ) t _  , and the generalized pressure is = 1 3 ( t - )  . in like manner we find that @xmath77    one other necessary component of uniting the mean field theory with the superfluid formalism is to relate ( locally ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 to the mean particle flux of the neutrons and protons ; i.e. @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the neutron and proton , respectively , components of the dirac spinor @xmath81 .",
    "recall again that we have arranged that the average neutron and proton particle fluxes are in the z - direction .",
    "thus , the unit vectors have only two components : @xmath82 it thus follows that = t^0_0 + t^z_z - t^x_x  .",

    "<S> general relativistic superfluid neutron stars have a significantly more intricate dynamics than their ordinary fluid counterparts .   </S>",
    "<S> superfluidity allows different superfluid ( and superconducting ) species of particles to have independent fluid flows , a consequence of which is that the fluid equations of motion contain as many fluid element velocities as superfluid species .  whenever the particles of one superfluid interact with those of another , the momentum of each superfluid will be a linear combination of both superfluid velocities .  </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the so - called entrainment effect whereby the motion of one superfluid will induce a momentum in the other superfluid .  </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a fully relativistic model for entrainment between superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons using a relativistic @xmath0 mean field model for the nucleons and their interactions .  in this context </S>",
    "<S> there are two notions of `` relativistic '' : relativistic motion of the individual nucleons with respect to a local region of the star ( i.e.  a fluid element containing , say , an avogadro s number of particles ) , and the motion of fluid elements with respect to the rest of the star .   </S>",
    "<S> while it is the case that the fluid elements will typically maintain average speeds at a fraction of that of light , the supranuclear densities in the core of a neutron star can make the nucleons themselves have quite high average speeds within each fluid element .  </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is applied to the problem of slowly - rotating superfluid neutron star configurations , a distinguishing characteristic being that the neutrons can rotate at a rate different from that of the protons .    </S>",
