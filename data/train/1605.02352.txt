    "in the probabilistic analysis of algorithms the complexity of fundamental algorithms is studied under models of random input . this allows to describe the typical behavior of an algorithm and is often more meaningful than the worst case complexity classically considered in computer science . in this paper",
    "we study the algorithm radix selection on independent strings generated by a markov source .",
    "radix selection selects an order statistic from a set of data in @xmath0 $ ] as follows .",
    "first , an integer @xmath1 is fixed and the unit interval is decomposed into the intervals , also called _ buckets _ , @xmath2 and @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "the data are assigned to these buckets according to their values .",
    "note that this just corresponds to group the data according to the first symbols of their @xmath4-ary expansions .",
    "if the bucket containing the datum with rank to be selected contains further data , the algorithm is recursively applied by decomposing this bucket equidistantly using the integer @xmath4 .",
    "the algorithm stops once the bucket containing the sought rank contains no other data . assigning a datum to a bucket",
    "is called a _ bucket operation _ , and the algorithm s complexity is measured by the total number of bucket operations required .",
    "an illustration of this procedure is given in figure [ pic_radsel ] .",
    "radix selection is especially suitable when data are stored as expansions in base ( radix ) @xmath4 , the case @xmath5 being the most common on the level of machine data . for such expansions a bucket operation breaks down to access a digit ( or bit ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the complexity of radix selection in the probabilistic setting that @xmath6 data are modeled independently with @xmath4-ary expansions generated from a markov chain on the alphabet @xmath7 . for the ranks to be selected we use three models .",
    "first , all possible ranks are considered simultaneously .",
    "hence , we study the stochastic process of the complexities indexed by the ranks @xmath8 .",
    "we choose a scaling in time and space which asymptotically gives access to the complexity to select quantiles from the data , i.e. , ranks of the size @xmath9 with @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "we call this model for the ranks the _ quantile - model_. second , we consider the complexity of a random rank uniformly distributed over @xmath11 and independent from the data .",
    "this is the model proposed and studied ( for independent , uniformly over @xmath0 $ ] distributed data ) in mahmoud , flajolet , jacquet and rgnier @xcite .",
    "the complexities of all ranks are averaged in this model and , in accordance with the literature , we call it the model of _ grand averages_. third , we study the worst rank complexity . here , the data are still random and the worst case is taken over the possible ranks @xmath11 .",
    "we call this _ worst case rank_.    the main results of this work concern the asymptotic orders of mean and variance as well as limit laws for the complexity of radix selection for our markov source model for all three models of ranks . the organisation of the paper is roughly as follows : for the _ quantile - model _ in section [ sec : quantile_model ] , we find gaussian limit processes for the uniform model ( defined below ) for the data as well as for the asymmetric bernoulli model ( defined below ) . throughout the present paper , convergence towards a gaussian process takes place in the space @xmath12 $ ] of cdlg functions endowed with the skorokhod topology . for the general markov source model with @xmath5 , we identify the first asymptotic term of the mean complexity and show that process convergence in @xmath12 $ ] does not hold .",
    "we discuss _ grand averages _ in section [ sec : markov : av ] . for uniform data",
    "it was shown in mahmoud et al .",
    "@xcite that the normalized complexity is asymptotically normal .",
    "we find that for markov sources ( with @xmath5 ) other than uniform the limit distribution is no longer normal , and the complexity is less concentrated",
    ". finally , section [ sec_worst_case_rank ] covers the _ worst case rank _ model . for the uniform model and the asymmetric bernoulli model we find limit laws for the worst case rank complexity . for general markov sources the linear growth order of the complexity is identified .",
