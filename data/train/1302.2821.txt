    "it is well - known that a single - cone dirac fermion is immune to backscattering and is thus hard to be localized.@xcite however , graphene has two dirac cones ( valleys ) , as required by the fermion doubling theorem.@xcite consequently , in the presence of impurities , the inter - valley scattering from impurities can not be strictly prohibited and this leads to remarkable backscattering , resulting in localization in two dimensions ( 2d).@xcite this is essentially different from three - dimensional topological insulators ( 3dtis ) , with just one dirac cone for each surface.@xcite    recently , silicene , which is the silicon version of graphene on a honeycomb lattice , has been an exciting subject .",
    "@xcite due to its buckled structure , the spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) is highly enhanced . with a perpendicular external electric field such structure",
    "also provides the tunability of the bulk gap @xmath0.@xcite as the applied field increases , the gap closing and reopening indicates a topological phase transition between a 2dti and a trivial band insulator .",
    "@xcite exactly in the critical gapless state , where @xmath1 , the low - energy electronic structure can be described by a massless dirac hamiltonian , forming two dirac cones .",
    "the presence of various soc interactions on the lattice results in rich spin textures around the dirac points and eventually leads to profound behaviors in response to impurity scattering .",
    "the most intriguing property of the gapless gated silicene , also the focus in this work , is the opposite spin polarization at different valleys , i.e. , the valley - spin locking.@xcite explicitly , the dirac cone around @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) point is polarized with spin up ( down ) , mainly originating from the intrinsic soc between next nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) sites as well as broken inversion symmetry due to the external electric field .",
    "thus , such phase is dubbed spin - valley - polarization metal ( svpm).@xcite ideally assuming no rashba soc , the spin around each cone is fully polarized , and , contrary to graphene , inter - valley ( also spin - flip ) scattering from non - magnetic impurities is strictly prohibited by time reversal symmetry ( trs ) . therefore , two dirac cones in this system are effectively decoupled and consequently the two - component , single - flavor dirac physics emerges .",
    "now it is quite essential to ask if there can be any delocalized states in the strict sense under disorder .",
    "in addition , rashba soc , which includes spin - flip processes , is nevertheless inevitable in realistic silicene .",
    "can it induce inter - valley scattering and lead to the breakdown of the single dirac cone physics as well ?    to answer these questions , in this paper , we systematically study the non - magnetic impurity scattering problem in the gapless system , designed to capture the physics of silicene and related materials , via numerical calculations . by comparing with various typical arrangements of socs",
    ", we found that 1 ) from the quasi - particle interference ( qpi ) pattern associated with single impurity , within a certain region of parameter space ( low energy , small rashba soc , and moderate impurity scattering strength ) for spin - valley - polarization metal , the `` unit - cell impurity '' will not give rise to significant inter- or intra - valley backscattering ; 2 ) the positive beta function ( defined below ) in the disordered system further confirms the conclusion in 1 ) and suggests the existence of a truly delocalized state .",
    "silicene or the ge , sn , and pb counterparts can be minimally described by a tight - binding model defined on a honeycomb lattice with energy scales @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 the first term describes the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping , where @xmath6 creates an electron at site @xmath7 with spin polarization @xmath8 .",
    "the second term represents the intrinsic soc between nnn sites , where @xmath9 are the pauli matrices for physical spins , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the two nn bonds connecting nnn sites @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",

    "the fourth term represents the staggered potential , and the strength @xmath17 can be tuned by a perpendicular electric field @xmath18 because of the buckling distance @xmath19 between two sublattices .",

    "hereafter , we adopt @xmath25 as the energy unit and lattice constant @xmath26 ( nnn distance ) as the length unit .    around two dirac points at @xmath27 in @xmath28-space , the low - energy effective hamiltonian for eq .",

    "gating the system such that @xmath36 but with @xmath37 , the full spin polarization of the valleys can be clearly seen : at valley @xmath2 , the spin - up bands are _ gapless _ forming a dirac cone , in contrast to spin - down bands now separated by a gap @xmath38 and thus out of the low - energy regime ; at valley @xmath3 it is in opposite orientation due to trs .",
    "the presence of considerable @xmath39 destroys this full spin polarization but the majority around each valley does not change .",
    "such states with two massless dirac cones will be the main focus throughout this work . restricting @xmath40 ( therefore @xmath1 ) while allowing one to vary their strengths as well as the values of the fermi level and @xmath39 in the system give rise to rich physics , which reflects the interplay among spin , sublattice ( pseudo - spin ) , and valley degrees of freedom under non - magnetic impurity scattering .",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) is called the qpi pattern , which can also be obtained experimentally from the fourier transformation of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements.@xcite this pattern provides an intuitive picture of scattering processes : significant scattering processes will manifest themselves as peaks in the qpi pattern with associated scattering momenta @xmath54 .    , impurity strengths @xmath55 , and rashba soc @xmath39 . the upper row ( a - c ) : @xmath56 and @xmath37 ; the middle row ( d - f ) : @xmath57 and @xmath37 ; the lower row ( g - i ) : @xmath57 and @xmath56 .",
    "the scanning angle is chosen along the @xmath58 axis from ( a ) to ( f ) , where possible intra - valley backscattering reaches its maximum amplitude @xcite , and along @xmath59 axis from ( g ) to ( i ) for the detection of possible inter - valley scattering .",
    "all other parameters are the same with fig .",
    "[ figmain](g).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as a warm - up but essential example , we start with the single valley , single spin , @xmath60 ideal dirac fermion hamiltonian with just linear terms , @xmath61 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqh1 ] ) ) , with @xmath62 the pauli matrix acting on sublattice ( pseudo - spin ) space .",
    "the impurity potential in @xmath28-space is diagonal as @xmath63 , @xmath64 , or their combinations with relative weight @xmath65 , @xmath66 the computed qpi , @xmath67 of @xmath68 , is plotted as the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ figmain](e ) .",
    "the curve has no significant scattering peaks , consistent with the well - known fact that @xmath68 can not induce backscattering for a massless ideal dirac fermion.@xcite notice that in the language of sublattice as pseudo - spin @xmath69 , @xmath68 corresponds to a `` unit - cell impurity '' which is uniform within two sites of a unit cell . on the other hand",
    ", we also show the qpi for the `` site impurity '' , @xmath70 , in fig .",
    "[ figmain](e ) as the black curve .",
    "two peaks associated with intra - valley backscattering can be seen .",
    "this is not surprising because @xmath70 is a mass term for ideal dirac fermion and destroys the pseudo-``trs '' , leading to a tendency towards localization.@xcite from results for an impurity with different weights of @xmath68 and @xmath70 also shown in fig .",
    "[ figmain](e ) , it is interesting to notice that , a small weight ( @xmath71 ) of @xmath68 is sufficient to annihilate the significant backscattering peaks into the smooth background . in real space ,",
    "an impurity with finite @xmath68 component corresponds to a long range one , with a smooth potential configuration within the unit cell .",
    "such impurities can be dominant in graphene@xcite and therefore should also be easily realized experimentally for silicene .",
    "moreover , the `` hollow - type '' and `` bridge - type '' adsorptions in silicene@xcite , which do not induce strong staggered potential , should also play such a role . in the rest of the paper , we will restrict ourselves to the discussions of unit - cell impurity @xmath68 .    in the following , we will consider the full tight - binding @xmath72 hamiltonian @xmath73 , i.e. , the @xmath74representation of @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . for comparison purpose ,",
    "we first take parameters @xmath76 such that @xmath73 describes graphene without soc . different from the case with ideal dirac fermion hamiltonian , @xmath73 here has two important features : the existence of two spins and two valleys , and higher order corrections ( trigonal warping ) within each valley , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figmain](b ) . given a unit - cell impurity potential , @xmath77 which is `` non - magnetic '' both for physical spin @xmath78 and pseudo - spin @xmath69 ,",
    "the corresponding qpi is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmain](f ) .",
    "it has very sharp peaks associated with inter - valley backscatterings between states with opposite @xmath46 and velocity , as indicated by the green arrows . as in ordinary orthogonal disordered systems in 2d , @xcite this strong backscattering is responsible for the localization in graphene @xcite and weak 3dti.@xcite in short , the coupling between two dirac cones ( with opposite berry curvatures @xcite ) makes the physics rather trivial .",
    "armed with qpi studies from above two examples , we come to our main focus , gapless silicene with @xmath79 for @xmath73 .",
    "such large soc is taken simply for giving enough space to extract out clear physics within our numerical precisions .",
    "no qualitative difference is expected as long as fermi energy @xmath80 , where the spvm picture holds .",
    "we first consider the spin conserved case @xmath37 , where each valley is fully spin polarized [ see fig .",
    "[ figmain](c ) ] , therefore inter - valley scattering is prohibited . indeed , with the same @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ eqva4 ] ) , now the qpi in fig .",
    "[ figmain](g ) is qualitatively different from that of graphene , but similar to that of the ideal dirac fermion [ fig .",
    "[ figmain](e ) ] . moreover , there are no significant _ intra_-valley backscattering peaks , either .",
    "the intra - valley features are almost isotropic in @xmath54 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figmain](g ) , even though the full band structure is anisotropic around each dirac point .",
    "it was argued that trigonal warping would lead to nonzero backscattering amplitude.@xcite however , our numerical results show that such backscattering is very weak and could be immersed in the continuum background of other scattering processes , reflected by the absence of associated distinguishable peaks .",
    "therefore , the gapless silicene with broken inversion symmetry effectively exhibits the massless dirac fermion physics , so long as the fermi energy is not far from the dirac point and the impurity strength is not strong ( i.e. , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , the energy scale which protects the spin - valley - polarization metal phase ) .",
    "this is one of the important findings in this work .",
    "the absence of remarkable backscattering should signify a delocalized state to disorders , as will be numerically verified later .    before entering into the discussion on disordered systems ,",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first , in figs .",
    "[ figmain](c ) and ( g ) , with vanishing @xmath83 , inter - valley scattering is in fact suppressed _",
    "a priori_. nonzero @xmath83 , as to be the case in silicene , makes the spin - valley polarization imperfect [ see fig .  [",
    "figmain](d ) ] . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figmain](h ) , it is remarkable to see that such rashba term does not give rise to a significant inter - valley scattering , and thus the effective `` single - valley dirac physics '' remains intact .",
    "this can be due to the following two intuitive reasons : 1 ) the nnn rashba interaction makes no contribution at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) points and thus its effect is also expected to be small around @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) points ; 2 ) the full backward scattering , which relates inter - valley points , _",
    "i.e. _ , time - reversal partners ( still with opposite spin polarizations under rashba interaction ) , is difficult to happen through _ nonmagnetic _ impurity .",
    "second , further increasing a parameter such as @xmath84 , impurity strength @xmath55 , or @xmath39 in the system is expected to enhance intra- and inter - valley scattering processes due to unavoidable contributions from higher order corrections and spin / valley mixing . indeed , as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ figefw ] , the qpi pattern changes at some point , indicating a transition from a delocalized to localized state beyond effective single - valley dirac physics .",
    "for instance , in the case of very strong @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ figefw ] ( i ) , although two states @xmath85 and @xmath86 in different valleys ( with exactly opposite spin orientations ) can not be coupled by a non - magnetic impurity , the spin orientations in their neighborhoods will not be exactly opposite .",
    "thus an inter - valley backscattering can be allowed due to the energy broadening @xmath87 .",
    "so far , the scattering from a single impurity has been investigated .",
    "if the backscattering is effectively ignorable , does this really lead to delocalized state in disordered gapless silicene with unit - cell impurities ? to confirm that it does , we perform a standard numerical scaling for disordered silicene .",
    "disorder is added to the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a random number uniformly distributed within @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath89 is independent of spin due to trs .",
    "if @xmath89 is further identical for two sites in each unit cell , then it corresponds to unit cell impurities @xmath68 . in realistic silicene material",
    ", such impurities can be long range impurities as in graphene@xcite , or the `` hollow '' and `` bridge '' types of adsorbed impurities as reported in refs . and .",
    "the intrinsic conductance @xmath91 is defined as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the two - terminal quantum conductance , @xmath94 is the number of propagating channels and @xmath95 is the contact resistance.@xcite this @xmath91 is suitable for a numerical scaling @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the average over random ensemble , and @xmath98 is the spatial size of the sample with a fixed ratio of length and width .",
    "this scaling function @xmath99 is used as a criteria : @xmath100 and @xmath101 correspond to localized and delocalized states , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ figg ] , we plot @xmath102 as a function of size @xmath98 ( in logarithmic scale ) , where the slope represents @xmath99 .",
    "it can be seen from figs .",
    "[ figg](a ) and ( b ) that , for unit - cell impurities , apart from some fluctuations due to the smallness of conducting channels , @xmath103 is clearly increasing with increasing @xmath98 , suggesting a delocalized state with @xmath101 .",
    "these are consistent with our results of the absence of significant backscattering from the single impurity study , further confirming the robustness of the effective single - valley dirac physics .",
    "note that this is totally different from the case of graphene with the @xmath104 [ black curve in fig .",
    "[ figg](c ) ] , where the slope is negative .",
    "it has been found that for graphene , even long - range impurities can not maintain a fully delocalized state with @xmath101 because of inevitable inter - valley scattering.@xcite of course , as in any lattice models , sufficiently strong disorder , for instance with @xmath105 , will eventually localize all the electrons , as the red curve in fig .",
    "[ figg](c ) shows .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect rich localization - delocalization transition behavior in the parameter space spanned by @xmath84 , @xmath106 , @xmath39 , and @xmath107 @xmath108 .",
    "more details of such localization - delocalization transition , e.g. , the universality , critical exponents , and global phase diagram will be discussed elsewhere .    delocalized bulk states in the doped kane - mele model with nontrivial z@xmath109 topological nature",
    "were found in ref .  .",
    "in that case , delocalized states can only appear when large ( comparable to @xmath84 ) and inversion - broken nn rashba soc is nonzero , making the system truly _",
    "symplectic_. otherwise , the system is just decoupled into two gapped _ unitary _ subsystems , namely , two massive dirac cones around @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where no states with @xmath101 can be observed.@xcite this is indeed reasonable as a gapped dirac cone has serious backscattering.@xcite in our case , however , the physics behind delocalization lies on either independent _ unitary _ subsystems , each of which owns a massless dirac cone ( zero nnn rashba soc ) , or _",
    "subsystems with two nearly independent gapless dirac cones ( nonzero nnn rashba soc ) .",
    "the dirac cones are already non - degenerate with almost fully spin polarization ( along the @xmath110 axis ) as long as the inversion - symmetric , nnn @xmath39 interaction is small .",
    "the essence of this work is to reveal the physics behind the delocalization phenomenon , which can be understood from the picture of effectively decoupled gapless dirac cones .",
    "this picture is valid in certain parameter ranges .",
    "here we emphasize again the relevant energy scales important to any experimental demonstration for the delocalization in silicene , such as the presence of a robust dirac point and linear dispersion in stm or the weak antilocalization in the magnetoresistance measurement .",
    "first , the gapless condition @xmath111 gives the critical electric field @xmath112v@xmath113 , which is experimentally achievable . in this case , the half width of the energy window for spin - valley locking is @xmath114 mev .",
    "this range can be even larger in the ge , sn or pb counterpart.@xcite on the other hand , such energy window is still small enough to keep the dispersion of dirac fermions linear .",
    "although nnn rashba soc breaks the perfect spin - valley locking , @xmath115 mev is less than 1% of @xmath25 , and therefore this effect is very weak .    in summary",
    ", we reveal the essential transport properties via numerical simulations on a critically gated buckled honeycomb structure of silicene ( and also suitable for the ge , sn , and pb counterparts ) under non - magnetic impurity scattering .",
    "in particular , as long as @xmath81 with @xmath116 , an energy scale of the order of @xmath117 , we find : 1 ) qpi by a single unit - cell impurity shows no significant backscattering , suggesting an effective _ single - valley _ dirac physics , in spite of weak trigonal warping .",
    "2 ) the robustness of such delocalized state is further confirmed by the positiveness of the @xmath99 function for a disordered system , even in the presence of rashba soc .",
    "our finding sheds a new light on constructing high mobility silicene - based electronic devices .",
    "moreover , we believe our result is also insightful to relevant systems such as a 2d mos@xmath118 @xcite and a cold - atom system with arranged soc.@xcite    yyz thanks q. f. sun , h. jiang and h. w. liu for beneficial discussions . this work was supported by nsfc ( grant no .",

    "wft is supported by the nsc in taiwan under grant no .",
    "102 - 2112-m-110 - 009 .",
    "an nn rashba soc term could also be induced by inversion symmetry breaking in the gated silicene .",
    "however , such coupling is estimated to be much smaller than @xmath119 and becomes zero at our focused gapless state.@xcite thus , one can safely ignore it ."
