    "the question what drives confinement and other nonperturbative phenomena of qcd at strong coupling is a long - standing one . in lattice gauge theory ,",
    "the simulation of these effects at the observational level of correlation functions is well - established .",
    "however , to extract the relevant degrees of freedom of the qcd vacuum remains a controversial problem which might not have a unique answer .",
    "the desire behind such attempts is to provide support for certain models like the instanton liquid or the dual abelian higgs model and to estimate their basic parameters .",
    "abelian and center projection have been used to focus on objects like abelian magnetic monopoles and center vortices , respectively , which are thought of as localizing certain embedded solutions that , strictly speaking , would exist only in the presence of higgs fields . despite the ambiguity in their definitions , these degrees of freedom are used especially for confinement - related scenarios of the qcd vacuum .",
    "instantons as selfdual solutions , on the other hand , can be conveniently related to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "field excitations resembling instantons have indeed been observed as the result of cooling .",
    "it has been objected that these methods modify the field configurations in an uncontrolled way such that the observed excitations could actually be fake and do not represent the relevant nonperturbative fields .",
    "other smoothing techniques also reveal lumps of action which are usually interpreted as instantons  @xcite . in order to relate these structures to confinement",
    ", some additional degrees of freedom seemed to be necessary .",
    "fermionic modes capture chiral and topological aspects of lattice gauge theory provided a dirac operator with good chiral properties is implemented . via the index theorem",
    "the number of ( left - handed minus right - handed ) zero modes gives the total topological charge . using a definition of the topological charge density based on the overlap dirac operator @xcite , non - zero modes are contributing to the topological charge distribution , too .",
    "analyzing the latter , global coherent structures of lower dimension have been identified @xcite .",
    "it has become customary to use the localization of the fermionic modes as a means to probe the vacuum structure . a specific scaling law of the inverse participation ratio ( ipr , see below ) of the low - lying fermionic modes w.r.t .",
    "lattice spacing and volume seems to be able to recognize the codimension of the underlying gauge field structure @xcite .",
    "however , to interpret the result , the latter has to be subject to a model , for instance one of those mentioned above .",
    "the fact , that fermion zero modes are localized to classical objects in smooth backgrounds , has lead to a thorough investigation of the local properties of zero and near - zero modes also in equilibrium backgrounds .",
    "their small ` energy ' eigenvalue should suppress contributions from large momenta and hence these modes are less sensitive to uv fluctuations .",
    "very recently such a programme has been carried out using zero modes in the adjoint representation @xcite .",
    "the trick of modifying the boundary conditions for the fundamental fermions by a complex phase has been introduced as a general tool in @xcite guided by the knowledge of calorons .",
    "these are instantons at finite temperature , i.e.  on @xmath1 .",
    "calorons have become attractive over the recent years because  when taken with nontrivial holonomy @xcite ( see below )  they account for a polyakov loop not in the center of the gauge group , as is the case on average in the confined phase .",
    "furthermore , calorons contain ( gauge independent ) magnetic monopoles , see fig .",
    "[ fig_bosonic ] ( a ) , which realize the scenario of fractional charge objects ( also called instanton quarks @xcite ) . for recent progress on calorons , both in the continuum and on the lattice ,",
    "see @xcite .    the caloron zero mode with different boundary conditions",
    "is correlated to different constituent monopoles @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig_bosonic ] ( b ) . in a similar way the zero modes on equilibrium configurations",
    "have been observed to localize to different locations on the lattice when scanning through the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this effect has been reported even for symmetric lattices representing ` zero temperature ' @xcite . given the intuition from calorons ,",
    "one expects these modes to detect carriers of topological charge , including such of fractional charge . however , to support this one would need additional evidence that the underlying structures actually have fractional or integer charge .",
    "a mechanism analogous to anderson localization in a random potential @xcite has been proposed as an alternative explanation for the localization and hopping of the fermionic modes .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the behaviour of the polyakov loop was shown in the previous section ( fig.[fig_struc_filter_polloop ] ) .",
    "the total action of the filtered configuration behaves like @xmath2 in a range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 eigenmodes .",
    "the interpretation of this particular dependence is not obvious , but the overall picture is clear : the more modes are included in the filter , the more fluctuations occur and contribute to the total action . in the example we use ( cf .  fig .  [ fig_struc_filter_polloop ] and [ fig_struc_filter ] )",
    "the action in the first nontrivial case @xmath3 is 66 in instanton units of @xmath5 , compared to a total plaquette action of 2131 for the original configuration .",
    "the first number should be read as the minimal content that survives the filter . the only way to achieve an ` even smoother configuration ' would be to apply the filter to the already filtered configuration .    the global maximum of the action density is only weakly varying with @xmath6 , meaning that there are peaks of about the same height at every stage of the filter . from fig .",
    "[ fig_struc_filter ] , showing the action density in a fixed lattice plane for different @xmath6 , it is evident that these peaks are quite narrow .",
    "this effect is counterintuitive , but has also been observed for caloron backgrounds in the last section .",
    "the peaks look the same in a space - time plane , too , i.e.  they are not static .",
    "the figure also shows that at least some of the peaks are stable w.r.t .",
    "@xmath6 , that is they stay as local maxima .",
    "their width is not changing much either .    in order to more quantitatively",
    "describe the filtered structure we have performed a cluster analysis .",
    "lowering the threshold we have recorded the number of clusters and their respective volume , size and accumulated action .",
    "the number of clusters first raises and after reaching a plateau decreases again due to cluster mergings , while the peaks remain .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_struc_filter_cluster ] , the corresponding curves fall almost on top of each other , when the number of clusters is taken relative to its maximum at that @xmath6 ( see tab .  [ tab_act_vs_clusters ] ) .",
    "that suggests that the difference in the filtered action for different @xmath6 is due to the different _ number _ of clusters .",
    "otherwise they are rather similar .",
    "other indications for that are the volume , the size and the action per cluster , which  plotted as a function of the threshold  fall on top of each other as well .    .",
    "]    in tab .",
    "[ tab_act_vs_clusters ] we give for each @xmath6 the maximal number of clusters .",
    "the latter appears at a threshold of roughly a third of the global maximum , where all clusters together have accumulated a few percent of the lattice volume and roughly 15% of the action .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the maximal number of action density clusters roughly agrees with half the total action ( in instanton units , see tab .",
    "[ tab_act_vs_clusters ] third and second row ) .",
    "a lower bound for the estimated action per peak is thus 0.3 .",
    "more realistic is to assign part of the remaining action below the threshold to the peaks ( sitting in their tails ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig_struc_filter_cluster ] we read off that at a threshold of 0.01 ( around @xmath7 of the global maximum ) the number of clusters starts to fluctuate because the region of action density noise has been reached . at that threshold",
    "the accumulated action of the clusters is roughly 60% of the full one .",
    "this results in an average action per peak of 1.2 in instanton units .",
    "hence , from an action density point of view , this estimate is compatible with an interpretation of the peaks as ( possibly fractional ) instanton lumps .    indeed , the local maxima of the action density are often accompanied by local extrema in the topological charge density .",
    "this is visualized for @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ fig_struc_filter ] ( d ) . however , the topological charge density does not equal the action density at the peaks .",
    "for the global maximum at @xmath8 the ratio of both quantities is 0.87 , but for other local maxima no signature of ( anti)selfduality was found .",
    "moreover , the total topological charge of generic configurations expressed in terms of the filtered links is not close to an integer . in this respect , the configuration , although it is filtered , is not smooth enough to make the @xmath9 improved field strength definition of the topological charge work .",
    "fermionic definitions via the index should be used to determine whether the filter preserves the total topological charge .",
    "the peaks seem to have nothing to do with the maxima of the modulus of the laplacian mode in that background , but with the determinant used as the normalization factor in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_link_filtered_final ] ) .",
    "obviously this determinant is given in terms of eigenmodes ( and eigenvalues ) of the laplacian , too , thus it also contains information about the gauge background .    another interesting question is whether the new filter is related to smearing and cooling . in fig .",
    "[ fig_struc_filter ] we compare the corresponding action densities to the filtered ones , where the number @xmath6 of modes was chosen such that the total actions are comparable . for instance , 2 cooling steps result in an action of 172 , which therefore compares to @xmath10 ( see fig .  [ tab_act_vs_clusters ] second row ) and 5 smearing steps result in 84 which compares to @xmath11 . as the third and the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig_struc_filter ] show , the corresponding peaks seem to agree locally , which is a nontrivial correlation , because both methods lower the total action by a smoothing procedure , but in completely different ways .",
    "in contrast , 5 cooling steps lead to an action of 56 , which seems to be comparable to @xmath3 . the action density , however , looks very different .",
    "it is clear that for more cooling steps the correlation to the filter has to break down , since cooling typically drives towards action plateaus of a few instanton units and finally removes the string tension .",
    "this is avoided in the filter method .",
    "more work has to be done to better understand the ( @xmath6-dependent ) spiky structures induced by the filter .",
    "we have investigated laplacian eigenmodes in both classical and thermalized gauge configurations with respect to their capability to analyze certain properties of the background .",
    "our localization studies for classical backgrounds lead to the conclusion that there is an analogy to fermionic ( near zero ) modes . in caloron backgrounds",
    "they detect the monopoles by a minimum and a maximum and hop between these constituents upon changing the boundary condition angle @xmath12 .",
    "we conclude that such a localization is merely due to information about the gauge background in the covariant derivative , which is modified by the angle @xmath12 in the same way , and does not depend much on the spin of the analyzing field .    yet , there is some difference between fermionic and laplacian modes .",
    "this concerns for instance the behaviour under intermediate boundary conditions . for the caloron fermionic zero mode one lump grows at the expense of the other , while the laplacian ground state develops a valley .",
    "also the precision of the localization is lower than for the fermions : the maximum of the modulus is less pronounced and static even for a time - dependent action density of the background . for the minimum",
    "these problems do not occur , but the locations of both , minimum and maximum , deviate from the constituents",
    ". moreover , the modulus of the mode approaches the average value away from those structures and hence the ipr s are rather small .",
    "that is why the laplacian modes resemble modified waves rather than exponentially localized discrete states ( in continuum language ) .",
    "the wave character also applies to the laplacian modes in the adjoint representation , where the underlying structures ( constituent monopoles or instantons ) are detected by minima only .",
    "we expect them to become zeros in the continuum , which is natural from the point of view of the laplacian abelian projection . for antiperiodic adjoint modes these minima form even two - dimensional sheets between the constituent monopoles .",
    "we have illustrated this for a semiclassical background , too .",
    "signatures of the taubes winding can be found in both representations .    in thermalized backgrounds ,",
    "there is clear evidence that the lowest mode changes its global maximum with the boundary conditions .",
    "different intervals in the boundary condition angle @xmath12 emerge , where different local maxima take over the role of the global maximum .",
    "we have observed up to 4 jumps per configuration and the corresponding lattice locations seem to be close to randomly distributed .",
    "these locations are also visited by excited laplacian modes and those in the adjoint representation .",
    "the corresponding global minima are not stable under the boundary condition ( and the number of local minima is large ) .",
    "therefore they could not be used as a practical tool for localization .",
    "thus , a straightforward interpretation of laplacian modes on thermalized backgrounds in terms of classical objects is not possible . in this context",
    "it would be interesting to study the effect of quantum fluctuations on the laplacian modes by heating a classical background .    actually , the ipr is basically insensitive to minima .",
    "another observation that questions the use of the ipr is that , in most cases we studied , it is proportional to the value at the global maximum .",
    "this large value apparently dominates the sum in the ipr definition and therefore the latter gives no new information .",
    "in addition to the ipr measurements we have performed a cluster investigation . somewhat unexpectedly we have found that the fundamental laplacian mode can even be characterised as a global structure ( depending on @xmath12 ) .",
    "apart from the weaker localization and their more static nature , the laplacian modes behave again similar to fermionic modes .",
    "a natural next step is to clarify whether laplacian and fermionic modes on the same configuration see the same locations . in order to eventually go beyond a purely empirical description",
    "it is desirable to sort out and measure the relevant gluonic features in the gauge field backgrounds , for instance the topological charge density .",
    "smoothing techniques like smearing could be used for this purpose , although they have the disadvantage to modify the gauge background .",
    "then the laplacian modes become similar to those in classical backgrounds : they level off thereby lowering ( and joining or slightly moving ) the lumps and smoothing the minima .",
    "we have pointed out an interesting relation of the unsmeared laplacian mode to a gluonic observable after smearing : the smeared polyakov loop provides pinning centres , some of which the laplacian mode occupies .",
    "such a finding in itself is in accordance with both hypotheses , calorons underlying the thermalized configuration and anderson localization .",
    "more work has to be done to better assess the real mechanism .",
    "another interesting question is whether the laplacian modes reveal signatures of the deconfinement phase transition . as a first signal",
    "we have seen a qualitative difference in the @xmath12-dependence of the spectrum . of course the laplacian modes",
    "should also be investigated at zero temperature , to see to what extent the properties described in this paper remain .",
    "+ laplacian eigenmodes are the natural ingredients for a fourier - like filter .",
    "we have described a new method to reconstruct the link variables by truncating a sum over laplacian modes . because of the use of eigenmodes one might view this technique as a nonlocal smoothing .",
    "it is actually not too expensive , the computation of @xmath8 modes on a @xmath13 lattice including the reconstruction of the links takes a minute on a 1.7 ghz pc .",
    "it should be stressed that the filtered links allow for the measurement of any quantity and that the procedure is not biased towards any particular degree of freedom in the qcd vacuum .",
    "the striking properties of the filter are that it reproduces classical structures , in particular selfduality , and preserves the string tension ( within 15% ) when applied to equilibrium configurations .",
    "the number of laplacian modes can be kept remarkably low , typically on a @xmath13 lattice , might depend on the lattice volume and the coupling constant . ] 4 out of more than @xmath14 eigenmodes start to reproduce the mentioned features qualitatively . because the filter keeps the relevant long - range disorder ,",
    "we claim a ` low mode dominance ' in the confining properties of lattice gauge theory .",
    "the filter has a lower limit , namely @xmath3 modes .",
    "it might well be that the content of action density and polyakov loop fluctuations for this case is minimally required to keep the long - range physics .",
    "for the same reason it is clear that the observed similarity of the filter with smearing and cooling is limited , for instance to early stages of cooling .",
    "apart from the number of modes the only filter parameter is the phase in the boundary condition .",
    "we have shown that it influences the quality of the filter and that in the confined phase ( at finite temperature ) it is best set to the intermediate value @xmath15 .    concerning the tomography of the filtered configurations we have not yet reached a final understanding .",
    "the filtered polyakov loop is narrowly distributed around 0 and approaches the original distribution for @xmath16 . in the emerging action density",
    "isolated peaks appear , both for caloron and equilibrium configurations .",
    "this seems counterintuitive , taking into account that the filter uses the _",
    "lowest _ laplacian modes .",
    "one should keep in mind , though , that the contribution of the high end of the spectrum is almost the same as for the low end ( due to the staggered symmetry ) .",
    "it seems that the peaks are correlated to the normalization factor ( inverse square root of the determinant ) that has to be applied to project the filtered link back to @xmath0 .",
    "this mechanism as well as a possible relation to the structures found by fourier - filtering in landau gauge @xcite and to singular gauge fields @xcite has to be clarified .    in this context",
    "it might be helpful to improve the filter procedure .",
    "first of all , the lattice laplace operator could be replaced by an improved version .",
    "the second opportunity is to interpolate the eigenmodes .",
    "this leads to filtered links on finer lattices ( similar to inverse blocking @xcite ) , which can be subject to blocking .",
    "a prerequisite for this idea is that not only the modulus but also the components of the lowest - lying eigenmodes are fairly smooth .",
    "this is actually the case in laplacian gauge .",
    "there are some possibilities to generalize our method or to apply it in another physical context .",
    "the obvious applications are to zero temperature and to the deconfined phase , respectively .",
    "for the latter we have checked that filtering with @xmath15 results in no string tension , however , one might be forced to fix @xmath12 in a different way .",
    "the quality of the filter in this phase could be checked by virtue of the spatial string tension .",
    "the generalization to higher gauge groups is not completely trivial .",
    "we have used the charge conjugation symmetry ( relying on the pseudoreal nature of @xmath0 ) in the derivation of the filtered links becoming unitary .",
    "for gauge groups @xmath17 the singular value decomposition seems to be the only alternative .",
    "fermionic modes could also be used to reconstruct the gauge field , provided one is able to project out the spin indices to arrive at an exact formula for the links .",
    "this variant of the filter will be more expensive , but might be advantageous concerning topological properties of the gauge field background .",
    "we are grateful to pierre van baal to make our collaboration possible .",
    "we would like to thank him as well as philippe de forcrand , jeff greensite , hans joos , kurt langfeld , michael mller - preussker , daniel nogradi , stefan olejnik , ion - olimpiu stamatescu and andreas wipf for helpful discussions .",
