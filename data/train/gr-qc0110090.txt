    "[ secintro ]    of all the topological defects @xcite , which may have been formed during phase transitions in the early universe , cosmic strings @xcite are those which have attracted most attention from a cosmological point of view .",
    "they were introduced into cosmology some 20 years ago by kibble @xcite , zeldovich @xcite and vilenkin @xcite , and were considered for a long time as possible sources for density perturbations and hence for structure formation in the universe .",
    "indeed , the latest data from the boomerang and maxima experiments @xcite disagree with the predictions @xcite for the cosmic microwave background anisotropies based on topological defect models ( see also ref .",
    "this seems to point to the conclusion that if cosmic strings were formed in the early universe they could not have been responsible for structure formation",
    ". however , cosmic strings are still cosmologically relevant and enjoy wide interest in cosmology .    the most common field - theoretical model , which is used in order to describe the generation of cosmic strings during a phase transition , is the abelian higgs model .",
    "this model is defined by the action :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar , @xmath4 the abelian field strength , @xmath5 is a complex scalar field with vacuum expectation value @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the usual gauge covariant derivative .",
    "we use units in which @xmath8 and a `` mostly minus '' metric .",
    "the simplest form of a cosmic string is just a direct generalization of the nielsen - olesen flux tube @xcite , which takes into account its gravitational effect .",
    "because of the cylindrical symmetry , we use a line element of the form : @xmath9 and the usual nielsen - olesen ansatz for the + 1 flux unit : @xmath10    since the flux tube is very concentrated along the symmetry axis , it is quite natural to expect that it will generate a spacetime geometry with the asymptotic behavior of the general static and cylindrically - symmetric vacuum solution of einstein equations @xcite , the so - called kasner solution : @xmath11 where @xmath12 sets the length scale while @xmath13 represents the asymptotic structure , as will be discussed below .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 must satisfy the kasner conditions : @xmath15    more information about the solutions can be obtained by inspection of the full system of field equations with the appropriate energy - momentum tensor , which we will not write here ( see however section 4 or refs.@xcite ) . here",
    "we will only give a condensed summary .",
    "for cylindrical symmetry , the components of the energy - momentum tensor of the flux tube @xmath16 have the property of @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the solution will have a symmetry under boosts along the string axis , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the kasner conditions ( [ kasner2 ] ) then leave only two options , which are indeed realized as solutions of the full einstein - higgs system @xcite .",
    "the standard conic cosmic string solution @xcite is characterized by an asymptotic behavior given by ( [ kasner1 ] ) with : @xmath19 which is evidently locally flat . in this case , the parameter @xmath13 represents a conic angular deficit @xcite , which is also related to the mass distribution of the source .",
    "in addition to the cosmic string solutions , there exists a second possibility : @xmath20 which is the same behavior as that of the melvin solution @xcite .",
    "eq.([mw ] ) is therefore referred to as the melvin branch .",
    "note however that the magnetic field in this solution inherits the exponential decrease ( with @xmath21 ) of the original nielsen - olesen flux tube .",
    "therefore , it is much more concentrated than in the original melvin solution where it decreases only according to a power law .",
    "the main difference between the two branches lies in the tolman mass , which is zero for the conic cosmic string solutions , but non - zero for the melvin solutions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the central magnetic field is generally larger for the melvin solutions .",
    "the string - like solutions of the abelian higgs model are the simplest and most studied ones ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , probable that when high energy corrections are taken into account , gravity is not purely tensorial .",
    "a minimal modification suggested by string theory @xcite is the introduction of a scalar degree of freedom , the dilaton @xmath22 , turning gravity into a scalar - tensor theory in the spirit of jordan - brans - dicke ( jbd ) theory .",
    "studies of cosmic string solutions in the framework of jbd theory and its extensions already exist in the literature @xcite , and the typical characteristics of the string - like solutions are found to be quite different from those of the gauge strings of pure tensorial gravity .",
    "the main difference is the absence of asymptotically conic solutions due to the long range effect of the massless jbd field . unlike the brans - dicke field , which is postulated not to couple to matter ,",
    "the dilaton may do so and may further change the situation .",
    "this is represented by the following action @xcite , which is written in the so called `` jbd / string frame @xcite '' : @xmath23 the parameter @xmath24 serves as a general coupling constant between the dilaton and matter fields .",
    "newton s constant is added explicitly in order to keep track of the dimensionality of the various fields .",
    "this makes the action in the `` einstein / pauli frame @xcite '' contain the standard einstein - hilbert lagrangian : @xmath25 it is related to the former by the metric redefinition : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the metric tensor used in ( [ higgsdilaction1 ] ) and @xmath28 is used in ( [ higgsdilaction2 ] ) . from now on we will use the einstein frame for a clearer physical picture .",
    "this system was studied by gregory and santos @xcite .",
    "their analysis was done to first order in the parameter @xmath29 and is therefore valid only for weak gravitational fields .",
    "they concentrated in the one branch which contains for @xmath30 asymptotically conic solutions .",
    "however , since for @xmath31 no asymptotically conic solutions exist , there is no natural criterium to prefer one branch over the other , even if one is `` more flat '' than the other .",
    "moreover , the weak - field approximation breaks down both near the core of the string and far away from the string thus calling for a further investigation of the system .    in this paper",
    ", we expand the study of cosmic strings in dilaton gravity in two directions .",
    "+ 1)we analyze both branches and do not limit ourselves to weak gravitational fields .",
    "+ 2)we modify the dilaton coupling to matter fields in such a way that it will be uniform and the original einstein - higgs system ( [ higgsaction ] ) is recovered in a certain limit .",
    "[ secasympt ]    the field equations for the einstein - higgs - dilaton action ( [ higgsdilaction2 ] ) are straightforward to obtain and we give them already for flux tubes with cylindrical symmetry .",
    "their structure becomes more transparent if we use dimensionless quantities . as a length scale",
    "we use @xmath32 ( the  correlation length `` in the superconductivity terminology ) .",
    "we therefore change to the dimensionless length coordinate @xmath33 and we use the metric component @xmath34 which we still denote by @xmath35 .",
    "we also introduce the ' ' bogomolnyi parameter \" @xmath36 in addition to @xmath29 , which has been already defined above . in terms of these new quantities",
    "we get , for fixed @xmath24 , a two parameter system of five coupled non - linear ordinary differential equations ( the prime denotes @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 the sixth function , the metric component @xmath43 , turns out to be equal to @xmath44 due to the high symmetry .",
    "we have also to keep in mind the existence of the constraint which comes from the ( @xmath45 ) einstein equation , and gets the following form : @xmath46    the field equations are supplemented by the following boundary conditions , that should be satisfied by the scalar and gauge fields :    @xmath47    these are just the usual flux tube boundary conditions borrowed from the flat space version .",
    "moreover , regularity of the geometry on the symmetry axis @xmath48 will be guaranteed by the `` initial conditions '' : @xmath49 the presence of the dilaton requires additional conditions , which we impose on the dilaton field on the axis : @xmath50 the condition @xmath51 follows directly from the equations of motion and the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) , using also eqs.([boundarycond])-([initcond ] ) . as for the condition @xmath52 , notice that the equations of motion ( 2.1)-(2.6 ) are invariant under the following transformation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant",
    "thus , we can trivially get the solution for @xmath55 from the solution for @xmath52 by simple rescaling .",
    "since we are looking for string - like solutions to the system , we may easily get the asymptotic behavior of the metric components from the assumption that the right - hand sides of the einstein equations vanish exponentially fast , as in the case of pure tensorial gravity .",
    "consequently , the system reduces to a simple set of equations , which are easily integrated to power law solutions : @xmath56 the 3 parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are subjected to two conditions , which may be viewed as a generalization of the kasner conditions , eq.([kasner2 ] ) : @xmath60 these two conditions leave a one - parameter family of solutions , which may be visualized by the ellipse in the @xmath61 ( or equivalently @xmath62 ) plane ( fig.[ellipsea0 ] ) : @xmath63 the 2 branches of the einstein - higgs system ( the cosmic string branch and the melvin branch ) are represented in this picture by the top ( @xmath64 ) and bottom ( @xmath65 ) points of the ellipse , respectively .",
    "these points correspond to an asymptotically constant dilaton ( @xmath66 ) , and as we will show later , only the first is realized as an actual solution for the special value of the coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are related to the matter distribution through the following three quantities : the tolman mass ( per unit length ) @xmath67 , or rather its dimensionless representative @xmath68 : @xmath69 and two others : @xmath70 which is related to the string angular deficit , and : @xmath71 which may be interpreted as a dilaton charge .",
    "note that @xmath72 is manifestly positive definite and @xmath73 is positive definite for @xmath74 .",
    "the tolman mass is also non - negative since it is proportional to the power @xmath57 which is non - negative due to ( [ dilatonkasner ] ) .",
    "we further notice that , as in the non - dilatonic case @xcite , @xmath72 may be expressed in terms of the mass parameter @xmath75 and the magnetic field on the axis , which we represent by the dimensionless parameter @xmath76 :    @xmath77    the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are easily found to be expressible in terms of @xmath75 , @xmath73 and @xmath72 or as : @xmath78 the first of the two relations ( [ dilatonkasner ] ) is satisfied identically ; the second translates in terms of @xmath75 , @xmath73 and @xmath79 to : @xmath80",
    "[ secsols ] regarding the complexity and non - linearity of the system , it is quite evident that a detailed structure of the solutions can be obtained only numerically .",
    "we have performed a numerical analysis of the system and found that the solutions are paired , as in the non - dilatonic case , and have the characteristics that will be described below .",
    "the solutions have been found numerically by first discretizing the radial coordinate and then applying a relaxation procedure to the set of non - linear and coupled algebraic equations , @xmath81 , in the set of scalar functions evaluated at the grid points , @xmath82 .",
    "if the initial guess @xmath83 is good enough then the iteration obtained by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is found by solving the linear equation : @xmath86 ( gauss elimination with scaling and pivoting will do ) , will converge towards a solution for the discretized variables .",
    "we constructed a starting guess satisfying the boundary and initial conditions and still having several free parameters .",
    "changing gradually these parameters , we eventually stumbled into the region of convergence and a solution was found .",
    "having obtained one solution of this type , the rest could easily be generated by moving around in the parameter space in sufficiently small steps .",
    "representative plots of the solutions are given in figs.[soltna2a-1g0.4 ] , [ soltna2a - s3g0.4 ] and [ soltna2a0g0.4 ] .",
    "the simplest picture emerges in the case @xmath30 .",
    "the two branches of solutions for this paticular value of @xmath24 are particularly interesting . for fixed @xmath87 ,",
    "both solutions exist up to some critical @xmath88 ; see fig.5 .",
    "one is an ordinary cosmic string , as in einstein gravity with the additional feature of a non - constant dilaton .",
    "this solution has @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath66 independent of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the metric is very similar to the usual gauge string , but there are small deviations , due to the presence of the dilaton .",
    "it becomes identical to the metric of the einstein gravity gauge string only in the bogomolnyi limit ( @xmath91 ) , where eqs.([eqf])-([constraint ] ) reduce to : @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , i.e. first order differential equations for @xmath35 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "a typical solution of this kind is depicted in fig.[soltna2a-1g0.4](a ) .    the second branch in the case @xmath30 has for all values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 below the critical curve ( fig.5 ) , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath99 . this solution is quite different from its non - dilatonic analog , the main difference being the asymptotic spatial geometry which is now cylindrical .    at the critical curve ( fig.5 ) ,",
    "the two types of solutions become identical .",
    "asymptotically the corresponding spatial geometry is conic with deficit angle @xmath100 .",
    "the critical curve itself can be approximated by a power - law : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this is quite , although not exactly , similar to the result obtained in tensorial gravity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath88 - independence of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath30 is however the only case of such behavior .",
    "the generic one is such that for a given value of @xmath24 , the powers of the asymptotic form of the metric components and the dilaton change with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "put differently , we have now a situation where the values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend upon the three parameters @xmath24 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . therefore , the universal asymptotic form of the metric tensor , which corresponds to the two extremal points on the ellipse , is now replaced by a motion along the ellipse whose specific details depend on the value of @xmath24 .",
    "additional values of @xmath24 were studied in detail and here we give few further results for two more special representative points , so in all there are : @xmath104 these values were selected for the following reasons : concentrating on the einstein - dilaton - maxwell system , @xmath30 corresponds to certain compactified superstring theories @xcite , @xmath105 corresponds to jordan - brans - dicke theory and @xmath106 corresponds to ordinary kaluza - klein theory .    in both cases",
    "@xmath107 , @xmath105 the same two - branch picture emerges .",
    "one branch always contains the upper point of the ellipse ( @xmath64 ) at the limit @xmath108 , such that for small @xmath88 the `` almost asymptotically conic '' solutions of gregory and santos @xcite are obtained . for large @xmath88 the deviations from asymptotically conic geometry are more pronounced . at the same time",
    "a gravitational newtonian potential appears , so this kind of string exerts force on non - relativistic test particles far outside its core .",
    "the other branch exhibits also an @xmath87 and @xmath88 dependence of the powers @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , but has its @xmath108 limit at @xmath24-dependent points .",
    "this @xmath24-dependence can be understood if we note that the @xmath108 limit corresponds to two types of asymptotic behavior .",
    "one is the asymptotically conic cosmic string behavior and the other is that of the dilatonic melvin universe @xcite , which in our coordinate system corresponds to an asymptotic behavior with the following powers : @xmath109    the situation therefore is the following .",
    "first we fix @xmath24 .",
    "one branch ( the `` upper '' or `` cosmic string '' branch ) has the point @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath110 , @xmath90 as a starting point for @xmath108 , and as @xmath87 and @xmath88 change , the powers @xmath58 and @xmath59 move along the ellipse while @xmath57 changes accordingly ( see [ dilatonkasner ] ) . the other branch ( the `` lower '' or `` dilatonic melvin '' branch ) starts , for @xmath108 , with the above values eq.([dilatonmelvin ] ) for the powers @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 and the motion along the ellipse is done in the opposite direction so the two branches approach each other and `` meet '' at a point in between . in the meeting point , the solutions not only have the same asymptotic behavior , but they become actually identical .",
    "there are no asymptotically conic solutions except for @xmath30 .",
    "actually , this property can be understood analytically . for this",
    ", we note that a useful relation is obtained by adding the equation for the dilaton , ( [ eqphi ] ) to the equation for the metric component @xmath111 , ( [ eqn ] ) and integrating from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , using the boundary conditions ( on the axis ) : @xmath114 where we denote by @xmath115 the integration variable . in the case",
    "@xmath30 , this equation is easily integrated again and gives in this case : @xmath116 it follows that the dilaton charge is minus twice the tolman mass , @xmath117 .",
    "this imposes an additional condition on the powers of the asymptotic metric components for any @xmath87 , @xmath88 which selects two points on the ellipse .",
    "the first is : @xmath118 which is evidently locally flat .",
    "it is also easy to prove the converse , i.e. , that there are no asymptotically conic solutions for @xmath31 . in order to do it ,",
    "we start again with eq.([inteqnphi ] ) and notice also that for asymptotically conic solutions we need @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which yield @xmath66 .",
    "thus , @xmath119 and @xmath120 vanish asymptotically faster than @xmath121 and the left - hand side of eq.([inteqnphi ] ) vanishes asymptotically .",
    "but the right hand side of this equation is an integral of a sum of 4 positive - definite terms and it can vanish only if @xmath30 .",
    "it also follows that in this asymptotically conic solutions @xmath122 , while the central magnetic field is given by : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the deficit angle .",
    "there is as usual a second point on the ellipse namely : @xmath125 as indicated above , this represents the same asymptotic behavior as the dilatonic melvin solution ( with @xmath30 ) .",
    "this solution has non - vanishing dilaton charge and tolman mass .",
    "the central magnetic field fulfills the equation : @xmath126",
    "[ secunif ]    the model analyzed so far has a dilaton which couples ( in the einstein / pauli frame ) with different strengths to various matter fields . as a consequence",
    ", we do not return to the pure tensorial ( einstein ) gravity in the limit of vanishing dilaton coupling .",
    "the only case of identical solutions of the two systems is the cosmic string solutions with @xmath30 and @xmath127 .",
    "it seems therefore natural to consider a uniform coupling of the matter fields to the dilaton .",
    "this uniform coupling will be described by the following action : @xmath128    the corresponding field equations for the cylindrically symmetric case will be a simplified version of ( [ eqf])-([constraint ] ) : @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 with the constraint : @xmath134    the asymptotic behavior of the metric components and the dilaton field are obtained as before and the results are identical to ( [ asymptvac])-([elipse ] ) .",
    "analysis of the new system shows that the solutions do not change much except in the case @xmath30 , where an asymptotically conic solution does not exist any more , see fig.6 .",
    "actually , there are no asymptotically conic solutions in this system for any combination of parameters and in this respect the solutions are more similar to the string - like solutions in jbd theory .",
    "it is quite simple to show that the only case where asymptotically conic solutions exist , in the case of this uniform coupling , is @xmath105 . the way to do it is to obtain an equation analogous to eq.([inteqnphi ] ) and to see that it can be satisfied by asymptotically constant @xmath111 and @xmath22 only for @xmath105 .",
    "this is just the einstein - higgs system with a massless real scalar .",
    "we have analyzed in detail , using both numerical and analytic methods , the cosmic string solutions in dilaton - gravity .",
    "contrary to previous works , we did not limit ourselves to one branch in the weak - field approximation .",
    "we found it most natural to work in the einstein frame , but all our results are trivially transformed into the string frame .",
    "we have shown that the solutions generally come in pairs .",
    "that is , any point in parameter space gives rise to two solutions with completely different asymptotic behaviors for the dilaton and for the geometry .",
    "generally , neither of the two branches describe asymptotically flat solutions .",
    "this should be contrasted with the non - dilatonic case , where one branch always describes asymptotically flat solutions . only for a very special coupling to the dilaton , which is related to certain compactified superstring theories ,",
    "do asymptotically flat solutions appear .",
    "our aim in this paper was to consider cosmic strings in the simplest dilaton - gravity models parametrized by a phenomenological coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "in the special case of fundamental string theory , which is related to our models for @xmath30 , there is an infinity of curvature corrections ( controlled by the reciprocal string tension @xmath135 ) and an infinity of string loop corrections ( controlled by the string coupling which is proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "however , since our solutions for @xmath137 are everywhere non - singular and with finite dilaton , we expect that they will be only slightly modified in the full ( yet unknown ) quantum string theory .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors of the solutions in the two branches seemed at first to depend in an extremely complicated way on the parameters of the theory .",
    "however , a universal picture emerged , as explained in section 3 .",
    "these results were obtained by coupling the dilaton `` uniformly '' to matter in the string frame . for comparison ,",
    "we re - analyzed the whole problem using a uniform coupling in the einstein frame which may seem to be more natural . among other things , the correct tensorial ( einstein )",
    "gravity solutions now come out in the limit of vanishing dilaton coupling .",
    "but otherwise the solutions in the two models are quite similar .",

    "<S> the static string - like solutions of the abelian higgs model coupled to dilaton gravity are analyzed and compared to the non - dilatonic case . except for a special coupling between the higgs lagrangian and the dilaton , the solutions are flux tubes that generate a non - asymptotically flat geometry . </S>",
    "<S> any point in parameter space corresponds to two branches of solutions with two different asymptotic behaviors . unlike the non - dilatonic case , where one branch is always asymptotically conic , in the present case the asymptotic behavior changes continuously along each branch . </S>",
