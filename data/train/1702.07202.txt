    "anomalous superdiffusive processes describe a wide variety of systems arising in different disciplines such as physics and biology .",
    "levy walks is one of the simpler models that lead to this feature denisov , monti , zumo , trefan , soko , zebro .",
    "it is a generalization of the classical drude model where a particle moves , in successive random directions , with constant velocity during random periods of time .",
    "depending of the mean sojourn times a _ transition _ between diffusive , superdiffusive and ballistic behaviors is obtained @xcite .",
    "similarly to other anomalous diffusive processes burovs , burov , gbel , fuli , igor , radons , xxx , cherstvy , peters , garcia , bodrova , safdari , yan , aki , maria,2017 , the ergodic properties of lvy walks were recently studied through its time - averaged moments @xcite which , as in single - particle tracking techniques @xcite , are defined by a temporal moving average performed with only one single trajectory .",
    "the behavior of the time - averaged mean square displacement strongly departs from that of subdiffusive continuous - time random walks @xcite where , even at infinite measurement times , they are intrinsically random objects",
    ". for levy walks this randomness is absent @xcite . nevertheless , when considering trajectories made over a finite measurement time an apparent randomness emerges both in the scaling exponents as well as in the amplitudes of the time - averaged mean square displacement .",
    "this feature can be related to trajectories where the walker persists along a great fraction or even during an entire trajectory with the same velocity . for infinite measurement times ,",
    "ensemble and time - averaging only differ by a constant @xcite , effect called ultraweak ergodicity breaking  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , time - averaged response to a bias and the corresponding generalized einstein relation @xcite were also studied @xcite .",
    "the previous results were obtained from a renewal description @xcite of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , alternative underlying dynamics may also lead to superdiffusion .",
    "for example , similar analysis were performed by considering a deterministic diffusion model @xcite and also correlated random walks @xcite .",
    "in addition , globally correlated dynamics , where the walker dynamics depend on the whole previous history of transitions gunter , kim , kursten , kenkre , gandi , silva , coletti , baur , esguerra , katja , boyer , also may lead to superdiffusion .",
    "interestingly , a ballistic behavior with an intrinsic randomness of the time - averaged observables was obtained recently from an urn - like global correlation mechanism @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to investigate if similar results can be obtained in a sub - ballistic regime and to explore up to which point previous results based on renewal memoryless dynamics are intrinsic to superdiffusive process and which are intrinsic properties of the model .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to introduce an alternative description of superdiffusion based on global memory effects and to study its ensemble and time - averaged observables .",
    "the model interpolates between two previous known dynamics : the elephant model @xcite and the urn - like model of ref .",
    "the transition probability of the walker depends on a weighted linear combination of the number of both right and left previous transitions .",
    "hence , jumps can be correlated or anticorrelated with the previous history .",
    "depending on the memory parameter values , the ensemble behavior suffers a transition between diffusion , superdiffusion and ballistic behaviors .",
    "we show that in contrast to levy walks , for infinite measurement times the time - averaged moments strongly differ from their ensemble behavior .",
    "in fact , they are equal to that of an undriven diffusion process . hence , ergodicity is broken , while an ultraweak ergodicity breaking effect only appears in the diffusive regime .",
    "on the other hand , averages performed with finite - time trajectories develop similar properties to that of levy walks , that is , they become apparently random .",
    "this feature here is related to the non - stationary power - law decay of the transition probabilities to their stationary values .",
    "in contrast with previous results @xcite , for the studied model we also show that time - averaged response to a bias dye out in the asymptotic regime .",
