    "( vlbi ) radio astronomy requires a low - phase - noise ultra - stable frequency reference .",
    "such a reference is commonly derived at 10 mhz from a hydrogen maser .",
    "the development of a cryocooled sapphire oscillator ( cryocso ) and frequency synthesizer described here offers a lower noise alternative .",
    "cryogenic sapphire oscillators ( cso ) @xcite have demonstrated extremely good frequency stability ( characterized in terms of allan deviation ) at integration times in the range 1 s to 1000 s. however , these oscillators do not operate at precisely prescribed repeatable frequencies . transferring their stability to precisely 10 mhz and 100 mhz",
    "presents technical challenges @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the design and implementation of a synthesizer based on an ultra - stable cso @xcite complemented by very low phase noise digital dividers and a direct digital synthesizer ( dds ) @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the performance of the synthesizer in terms of phase noise and stability of the synthesized 10 mhz and 100 mhz reference signals .    ) , the minicircuits amplifiers era-5 + and zfl-500ln+ , the minicircuits frequency multiplier zx90 - 2 - 13-s+ , the hittite dividers hmc - c007 ( @xmath5 8) , hmc365s8 g ( @xmath5 4 ) and the programmable hmc705lp4 divider ( where we used @xmath5 14 ) . note : pll ( phase - locked loop).,width=336 ]",
    "we constructed two nominally identical frequency synthesizers .",
    "1 shows a block diagram of the synthesizer based on a stable microwave oscillator , the cryocso , and a high - resolution dds phase referenced to a sub - harmonic of the cryocso signal .",
    "the output signal frequency of the cryocso is @xmath6 ghz .",
    "this signal is not tunable and the closest integer multiple of 100 mhz is 11.2 ghz . by frequency shifting the cryocso signal with a @xmath7 xxxxx mhz signal , generated by the dds unit , this produces the correct frequency for integer digital frequency division .",
    "the frequency shifting was performed with an image rejection mixer in order to suppress the spurious mixing product about 4 mhz above the useful signal . without this",
    "the spurious signal would impair the divider operation and filtering it out would require the use of an impractically high - q - factor microwave filter .",
    "the use of the image rejection mixer is an elegant alternative to solve the problem .    by combining an x - band iq commercial mixer with a custom made @xmath8/2 phase shifter we realized an image rejection of about 40 db .",
    "the signal levels are optimized to suppress the carrier by about 40 db . at the output of the image rejection mixer a 2-step digital frequency division by 56 produces a 200 mhz output .",
    "this 200 mhz signal , down - converted from the cryocso , is used to clock the dds synthesizer , as well as a reference signal for the phase - locked loop controlling the frequency of a low phase noise 100 mhz quartz oscillator , which is frequency doubled by a commercial low phase noise frequency multiplier .",
    "the phase - locked loop ensures that the ultra - high frequency stability of the cryocso is transferred to the 100 mhz quartz oscillator with only a small addition of noise .",
    "the frequency of the latter is further divided to 10 mhz , but with a non - negligible noise contribution from the divider .",
    "furthermore the circuit provides a 1.4 ghz by dividing the output signal of the mixer by 8 .",
    "this signal , which is very close to the hydrogen maser microwave transition , is a good candidate for future very low noise synthesizers .",
    "it is worth noting that the technique described here can easily be adapted to any of the possible microwave output frequencies from the cryogenic sapphire oscillator .",
    ".ssb phase noise ( @xmath9 ) @ 1 hz offset for the active components used in the frequency synthesizer at the power levels and frequencies@xmath10 specified in fig",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ coherence ]    from a qualitative point of view the coherence time is shorter at higher observing frequencies .",
    "therefore the stability of the local reference will impact more strongly at higher frequencies over the shorter averaging times .",
    "hence for millimeter wave observations the stability of the local oscillator becomes very important assuming the seeing conditions ( the atmosphere ) is not the limitation .",
    "using the analytical expressions , eqs ( [ fittotal10 ] ) and ( [ fittotal00 ] ) , obtained from fits to our measured stability @xmath11 data , in fig . 7 , we numerically calculated the coherence function from eq .",
    "( [ rmscoh ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath12 was determined using our 10 mhz and 100 mhz references , multiplied up to millimeter wave frequencies of 100 ghz , 230 ghz and 345 ghz .",
    "it is assumed that the same performance local oscillator is used on each end of the interferometer and that the multiplication process does not add any noise .",
    "the results are listed for 345 ghz in table [ coherence ] along with the oscillator stability at fixed integration times and compared to that calculated from a very high performance maser . a typical value of the t-4 science maser @xcite has been assumed .",
    "the frequency stability for that maser is shown as curve ( 4 ) in fig .",
    "similarly the coherence function @xmath12 was calculated using the stability data for this hydrogen maser ( with the same stability at both 10 mhz and 100 mhz ) where the same assumption was made as above .",
    "the resulting coherence function is then compared by plotting the ratio of @xmath12 derived from either the 10 mhz or 100 mhz synthesizer with that when the maser is used .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "9 , and show that the calculated coherence function is greater when using the 100 mhz reference due to its better short term stability .",
    "the references synthesized from the cryocso are significantly more frequency stable than those from a hydrogen maser , especially the 100 mhz output .",
    "the latter offers improvements above 200% in the value of the coherence function @xmath12 at observing frequencies of 345 ghz at coherence times near @xmath13 s , assuming that the frequency reference is the limitation .",
    "it is apparent from fig . 9",
    "that at observing frequencies less than 100 ghz there is only a small advantage in using the cryocso .",
    "it must be said that where the decoherence effects of the atmosphere can be avoided , or compensated for , there is a clear advantage in integrating the signals for an hour or more .",
    "this is where the cryocso offers a big advantage over the hydrogen maser , especially for millimeter wave vlbi .",
    "two nominally identical frequency synthesizers based on low phase noise digital dividers and a direct digital synthesizer have been constructed and their performance evaluated .",
    "the reference signals at 10 mhz and 100 mhz were synthesized from a cryocooled sapphire oscillator and their phase noise and stability measured .",
    "the synthesizer residual single sideband phase noise , at 1 hz offset , on 10 mhz and 100 mhz signals , respectively , were measured to be -135 dbc / hz and -130 dbc / hz . their intrinsic frequency stability contributions , on the 10 mhz and 100 mhz signals , respectively , were measured as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , at 1 s integration time .",
    "as such the fractional frequency noise on 100 mhz output , at short integration times , is only about a factor of 2 greater than that of the cryocooled oscillator itself .",
    "the estimated total frequency stabilities of the new references are significantly better than those for the same output frequencies from a very high performance hydrogen maser .    from these measurements",
    ", we calculated the coherence function , a figure of merit , for millimeter wave vlbi radio astronomy .",
    "the references synthesized from the cryocooled sapphire oscillator offer improvements in terms of the coherence function of the order of 200% or more , where one is able to average the signal for several hours , at observing frequencies well above 100 ghz . the 100 mhz output produces a better result than the 10 mhz output , as might be expected .",
    "the cryocooled sapphire oscillator has the potential to replace the hydrogen maser as the low noise frequency stable reference for millimeter wave vlbi radio astronomy .",
    "this work was made possible through an australian research council grant lp0883292 , with support from the university of western australia , csiro , curtin university of technology and poseidon scientific instruments .",
