    "orbital solutions obtained for eight of the stars ( ghez et al .",

    "@xcite ) tentatively suggest some trends in their orbital properties : a lower bound on the apoapse of @xmath17 pc ( ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ) and higher than random orbital eccentricities ( schdel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    none of the solutions proposed so far for the puzzle of the young stars ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ; ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ) are satisfactory .",
    "these fall into three categories : exotic modes of star formation near the mbh ; rejuvenation of old stars in the local population ; or dynamic migration from farther out , where stars can form .",
    "even if shock cooling of molecular gas by cloud - cloud collisions could trigger star formation near the mbh ( morris @xcite ) , molecular clouds would either form stars or be tidally disrupted well outside of the inner 0.1 pc ( vollmer & duschl @xcite ) . growth and rejuvenation by mergers ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) are not expected to be efficient in high velocity collisions near an mbh .",
    "tidal heating by the mbh requires that the stars approach the mbh much closer than they are observed to do ( alexander & morris @xcite ) .",
    "the young stars are too short - lived to have formed far from the mbh and then migrated inward by mass segregation or dynamical friction .",
    "the migration can be accelerated if the stars are associated with a massive `` anchor '' : an extremely dense young cluster ( portegies zwart , mcmillan & gerhard @xcite ; kim & morris @xcite ) , a very massive binary companion ( gould & quillen @xcite ) , or a @xmath18@xmath19 black hole ( hansen & milosavljevi @xcite )",
    ". however , these scenarios must assume the existence of very rare , or even hypothetical objects , or else they can not bring the stars close enough to the mbh .",
    "such processes may possibly explain the separate population of very massive and luminous `` he stars '' @xmath20@xmath21 pc from the mbh ( krabbe et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which we do not attempt to model here .",
    "our model is based on the fact that @xmath22@xmath23 stellar black holes ( sbhs ) of mass @xmath24@xmath25 are estimated to exist within @xmath26 pc of the mbh in the gc , where they have been accumulating by dynamical friction over the lifetime of the galaxy ( @xmath27 ) from a `` collection basin '' @xmath0 pc wide ( morris @xcite ; miralda - escud & gould @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the evolution of the gc ( freitag @xcite ) confirm that the sbhs sink to the center on a short timescale of a few gigayears , settle into a centrally concentrated distribution where the enclosed number scales as @xmath28 ( bahcall & wolf @xcite ) , and dominate the stellar mass there .",
    "on the @xmath26 pc scale , conditions are more favorable for star formation .",
    "observations ( figer et al .",
    "@xcite ) and theoretical arguments ( morris @xcite ) indicate that star formation in the gc is ongoing and is significantly biased toward massive stars . here",
    "we represent the present - day mass function ( pmf ) of the central few parsecs of the gc by a simple ( nonunique ) model that has such properties .",
    "we assume that the pmf is the product of continuous star formation at a constant rate with a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) in the range @xmath29@xmath30 , so that @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "stars with @xmath32 are assumed to evolve into @xmath33 white dwarfs ; those with @xmath34@xmath35 into @xmath36 neutron stars ( nss ) ; and those with @xmath37 into @xmath38 sbhs ( consistent with the mass distribution found in black hole binaries ; mcclintock & remillard @xcite ) . the gas lost in the course of stellar evolution",
    "is assumed to be efficiently expelled from the system . using the schaller et al .",
    "( @xcite ) solar metallicity stellar evolution tracks , we find that at @xmath39 gyr , the mass fraction in stars out of the total mass is @xmath40 , the mean stellar mass is @xmath41 and the number fraction of young stars in the range @xmath42@xmath2 is @xmath43 , with a mean mass of @xmath44 ( corresponding to @xmath45 and @xmath46 yr ) .",
    "dynamical measurements of the central gravitational potential indicate that the mbh mass is @xmath47 ( schdel et al .",
    "@xcite ; ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ) and that in the range @xmath48@xmath49 pc the stellar mass distribution is well represented by a spherically symmetric power - law distribution , @xmath50 , with the most recent calibration giving @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( r. genzel 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "the mass distribution and mass function translate to @xmath53 sbhs born inside the collection basin ( @xmath54 pc ) and to @xmath55 young stars inside @xmath56 pc , where the enclosed dynamical mass is @xmath57 , in general agreement with the observationally based pmf in the inner @xmath58 pc of mezger et al .",

    "young stars formed on the @xmath59 pc scale will not be on eccentric orbits initially , because their progenitor clouds can not survive the tidal field of the mbh . over time",
    ", the stars will be scattered by gravitational perturbations .",
    "the most efficient of these , which can operate on a timescale of less than @xmath60 , are due to massive star - forming clusters ( zhao , haehnelt & rees @xcite ) .",
    "one such cluster is statistically expected to exist , undetected , within a few parsecs of the mbh ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "it is also possible , albeit speculative , that cloud - cloud collisions on the few parsecs scale could lead to rapid formation of massive stars on radial orbits .",

    "the central density of the sbh cluster depends on various uncertain quantities : the sbh mass function , the stellar imf and formation rate , the remnant progenitor masses , and the dynamical age of the gc . a rough upper limit _ _ _ _ on @xmath63 can be obtained by requiring that the sbhs survive being drained into the mbh over the lifetime of the system , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 $ ] is the scattering rate into loss - cone orbits that take an sbh into the mbh , @xmath66 is the relaxation time ( assuming all the mass is in sbhs ) , @xmath67 is the loss - cone opening angle and @xmath68 is the coulomb cutoff ( e.g. , syer & ulmer @xcite ) .",
    "this constraint yields the relation ( solved numerically ) ,    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the schwarzschild radius of the mbh and @xmath71 is the orbital period at @xmath72 .",
    "we estimate the efficiency of the capture mechanism with the assumption that the angular momentum distribution of the young stars has been efficiently randomized . for simplicity",
    ", orbital periods and periapses are considered keplerian ( this is reasonable inside @xmath56 pc , where the enclosed mass is @xmath73 ) and the typical orbital energy of a star is represented by its virial energy ( equivalent to assuming the star was initially on a circular orbit ) .",
    "if the star is scattered to an eccentric orbit , it will pass by the mbh on a hyperbolic orbit relative to it , with energy ( alexander & livio @xcite)@xmath74\\!\\lesssim\\!0.1\\,,\\label{eq : e0}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the orbital semi - major axis ( sma ) and @xmath76 is the total mass enclosed within @xmath75 ( the tilde symbol denotes quantities in dimensionless units @xmath77=@xmath78=@xmath79=@xmath80 ; in these units , the stellar binding energy is @xmath26 ) .",
    "a three - body encounter ( heggie @xcite ) is characterized by a dimensionless relative velocity @xmath81 between the incoming star at infinity and the binary barycenter , where @xmath82 is the binding energy of an mbh - sbh `` binary '' with sma @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath84 ( a fast encounter with a soft binary ) , the incoming star carries enough energy to ionize ( disrupt ) the binary . when @xmath85 ( a slow encounter with a hard binary ) , the only possible outcomes are exchange , where the incoming star ejects one of the binary members and replaces it , or scattering , where the incoming star remains unbound .",
    "typical three - body encounters between an @xmath86 star and a sbh in the gc occur below the ionization threshold ( table [ t : xgc ] ) .",
    "note that the actual 2-body interaction between the star and the sbh is analogous to the high velocity exchanges studied by hut ( @xcite ) .",
    "an exchange can proceed via two channels : direct or resonant .",
    "it is direct when the star passes within the sbh capture radius @xmath87{\\widetilde{a}}_{\\bullet}$ ] and ejects it . in this case , the three - body analogy is justified because @xmath88 , the mean distance between stars .",

    "we derive it using the approximate equality between the binding energy of the original and exchanged binary ( heggie et al .",

    "the best fit parameters obtained from the numerical simulations are @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) describes an isolated system in which the binary has a specified sma and in which the captured star is initially unbound at infinity .",
    "capture by three - body exchange in the cg differs in that the stars are scattered from a finite distance and are captured by a distribution of sbhs enclosed within @xmath72 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) is then applied by replacing @xmath98 , the mean sma in a @xmath99 cusp , and by replacing    @xmath100\\right\\ } \\!,\\right.\\label{eq : v0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath101 .",
    "the ionization threshold remains at @xmath102 , but now ionization implies the ejection of the sbh out to a distance @xmath103 , where its orbit is randomized , and not to infinity .    the number of captured stars orbiting the mbh is the product of the capture probability per passage , @xmath104 , the typical lifetime of a star after capture , @xmath105 , and the incoming flux of young stars , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the orbital period at @xmath75 and @xmath108 is the fraction of stars on orbits that cross inside @xmath72 .",
    "the steady state number of captured young stars within @xmath72 is then@xmath109 where @xmath110 is the stellar mass density per unit sma . in a keplerian",

    "stars can also be captured from orbits with @xmath114 up to a maximal sma , where @xmath102 .",
    "however , the contribution of such stars to the total is small because of the longer @xmath107 and smaller @xmath115 .",
    "note that since @xmath116 increases with @xmath117 and @xmath75 , there exists a maximal radius where stars can be captured , @xmath118 pc . beyond this limit",
    "three - body interactions result in ionization , not capture .",
    "lrr & & number of observed young stars , @xmath119 & & , @xmath120 & & & & & & & & & @xmath121 & @xmath122 & @xmath123 & @xmath123    table ( [ t : xgc ] ) shows the number of captured stars , assuming that sbhs born in the central @xmath124 pc are now concentrated inside @xmath125 pc .",
    "this choice of @xmath126 ( e.g. morris @xcite ; miralda - escud & gould @xcite ) implies that the central concentration of sbhs is near the drain limit ( eq . [ eq : maxn ] ) and that sbhs dominate the central mass density , as expected in a dynamically evolved system ( freitag @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted mean number of captured stars is @xmath5% of those observed .",
    "the captured stars are expected to lie mostly at the low - mass and low - luminosity end of the observed range because lower - mass stars are more numerous and live longer .",
    "in addition to the fact that capture by exchange can account for at least some of the young stars , this mechanism can naturally explain observed trends in their orbital properties . because @xmath127 falls with the distance to the mbh",
    ", there exists a minimal distance @xmath128 where the capture radius equals the tidal radius of the sbh ( alexander & kumar @xcite ) . beyond this limit",
    ", an exchange is no longer possible since the star is disrupted .",
    "near disruption at @xmath129 , the tidal interaction absorbs orbital energy of the order of the stellar binding energy , so that the captured star loses most of its kinetic energy in the encounter , and @xmath129 then becomes the apoapse of the new orbit . in the gc , @xmath130 pc , which is consistent with the observed lower bound on the apoapse of the young stars ( the local relaxation time is longer than @xmath60 ,",
    "so they are expected to remain on their original orbits ) .",
    "we note that the extraction of orbital energy can increase the capture efficiency .",
    "a rough estimate indicates a factor of @xmath131 increase in the cross - section for captures occurring near @xmath129 , where the tidal interaction is strong .",
    "this effect was not included in the results quoted in table ( [ t : xgc ] ) .",
    "the numerical simulations also show that the exchanged binaries have higher than random eccentricities , even when the sbhs have a random ( thermal ) distribution of eccentricities .",
    "the bias becomes substantial the faster ( @xmath132 ) and more massive ( @xmath133 ) the incoming star is .",
    "this property of the exchange mechanism agrees with the observed trend .",
    "lower mass main - sequence stars in the range @xmath134@xmath8 ( @xmath3g2v  a0v ) can be similarly captured by nss .",
    "dynamical simulations of the gc indicate that the central number density of nss is @xmath135 that of the sbhs ( m. freitag 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "we find that there are @xmath6 lower - mass stars captured in the inner @xmath4 pc and @xmath136 captured in the inner @xmath20 pc .",
    "the efficiency of a `` billiard ball '' recoil depends strongly on the mass ratio of the colliding objects .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a stellar system around an mbh naturally provides a dense concentration of targets whose masses are well matched for stopping and capturing unbound young stars like those observed very near the mbh in the gc . the attempt to predict the number of captured stars is limited by the uncertainty in the mass and number distribution of the sbhs and in the number and orbital properties of young stars ( spectral types @xmath3b9v  o8v ) in the inner few parsecs of the gc .",
    "we show that under favorable conditions , capture can account for @xmath5% of the observed young stars .",
    "additional effects that were not taken into account here may increase the capture efficiency .",
    "we considered only capture by a single direct exchange in the point - mass approximation .",
    "however , a few weaker interactions may also lead gradually to capture during the star s lifetime . further study is needed to estimate the contribution of multiple scatterings to the capture cross section",
    ". tidal energy extraction in captures near the tidal limit also increases the capture cross section there .",
    "a possible outcome of internal mixing by a strong tidal interaction is an extended main - sequence lifetime and higher luminosity ( maeder & meynet @xcite ) .",
    "this would further increase the number of captured luminous stars ( eq . [ eq : ins ] ) .    in the context of direct exchange capture ,",
    "the stars with the smallest apoapse offer an opportunity to study the long term effects of a strong tidal interaction .",
    "interestingly , s2 , the star with the smallest apoapse , is also the brightest ( ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ; schdel et al .",
    "the orbital eccentricity distribution reflects the mass ratio between the star and the sbh .",
    "thus , a spectral determination of the masses of the captured stars together with a statistical analysis of their eccentricities can probe the poorly known mass function of sbhs .",
    "the total number of captured stars over the lifetime of the galaxy ( assuming steady state ) , @xmath137 ( for @xmath138 stars of @xmath25 in 0.1 pc ) , is of the same order as the number of sbhs in the inner parsec .",
    "thus , if the dynamical friction timescale at @xmath139 ( where the sbhs are ejected to ) is not much smaller than the age of the galaxy , the continual replacement of sbhs by ns progenitors and of nss by white dwarf progenitors ( fryer & kalogera @xcite ) may regulate the build - up of the dense cusp of compact stellar remnants .                          , r. , sch \" odel , r. , ott , t. , eisenhauer , f. , hofmann , r. , lehnert , m. , eckart , a. , alexander , t. , sternberg , a. , lenzen , r. , cl ' enet , y. , lacombe , f. , rouan , d. , renzini , a. , & tacconi - garman , l.  e. 2003 , , 594 , 812                            , j.  e. & remillard , r.  a. 2004 , in compact stellar x - ray sources , in press , ed . w.  h.  g. lewin & m.  van  der klis ( cambridge : cambridge university press ) , available at http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0306213"
