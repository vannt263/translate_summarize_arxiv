    "whether the metal abundance measured in the stellar surface represents correctly the value in the stellar core is a nontrivial question . in computations of the evolution of stars",
    "it is generally assumed that the initial metal abundance of the core is identical to the present day abundance of the surface , for which spectroscopic information is available for heavy elements .",
    "this agrees with the simple picture that stars formed by a contraction of the molecular cloud of the uniform composition .    in principle , however , the metallicities of the core and the surface can be different , unless the whole stars are fully convective like in low mass ( @xmath0 ) main sequence stars ( e.g. , iben 1967 ) .",
    "an extreme example is jupiter , where the core consists mostly of silicates , while the surface is dominated by hydrogen and helium with small admixture of heavier elements .",
    "it may well be that the origin of jupiter like stars is completely different from that of ordinary stars ( e.g. , podolak , hubbard & pollack 1993 ) : nevertheless it would not be absurd to imagine that rocks are taken into the core at the time of gas contraction , and the core has metallicity higher than in the surface since the birth of the star , for which the radiative transport dominates .",
    "there is also an effect that heavy metals tend to sink by diffusion towards the core , while the envelope becomes hydrogen rich .",
    "a calculation shows that such an effect do exist in the sun as evidenced from helioseismology , although the amount is small ( bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the main reason that one assumes the homogeneous composition throughout the star is basically due to lack of information of the metal abundance in the stellar interiors . in this article",
    "we consider the problem that the sun might offer a possibility to study the metal abundance in the deep interior or in the core through the solar neutrino observations that probe the core region of the sun .",
    "this problem , however , is not very obvious due to the famous solar neutrino problem that the observed neutrino flux is by a factor 24 times smaller than is predicted with the standard model of the sun ( bahcall 1989 ) .",
    "the most elegant and widely accepted solution to this problem is that electron neutrinos emitted in the nuclear reactions of the sun are converted by neutrino oscillation into muon or tau neutrinos that are sterile in the nuclear detector or have a much smaller cross section for scattering off electrons , as advocated by mikheyev and smirnov ( 1986a ; refereed to as the msw effect ) .",
    "this solution at first glance appears to make the things so flexible that almost any amount of the neutrino flux before the oscillation effect is experimentally allowed , if one tunes the neutrino mass and mixing parameters in some appropriate way .",
    "indeed , forgetting about all knowledge on the nuclear reaction cross sections , even the case that almost 100 % of the solar energy is generated by the cno cycle is not excluded solely by the solar neutrino experiment ( bahcall , fukugita & krastev 1996 ) .",
    "this , however , is too extreme .",
    "if we adopt the knowledge of nuclear reactions within the range allowed by the current experiment , the freedom is not that large .",
    "for instance , the amount of @xmath1b must be in the range between 1/32 times the value the standard solar model predicts , and the core temperature can be determined to within 5% of the standard solar model value ( hata & langacker 1997 ; hereafter hl97 ) in order to satisfy the current solar neutrino experiments , whatsoever the neutrino parameters one takes . in this paper",
    "we study to what extent the current solar neutrino experiments constrain the metal abundance in the sun allowing for msw neutrino oscillation ( or neutrino conversion ) .",
    "the increase of the metal abundance obviously promotes the cno cycle .",
    "it also increases opacity that modifies the core temperature .",
    "therefore , it increases the relative importance of the neutrino flux from the cno cycle significantly .",
    "this increment of the cno neutrino flux must be cancelled by increasing importance of the suppression factor coming from the neutrino oscillation to keep the consistency with the solar neutrino experiments . in so far as this works , a larger metal abundance in the solar interior is allowed .",
    "if the metal abundance is increased more , however , we no longer have solutions that satisfy all the solar neutrino experiments in a consistent way .",
    "this is the logic that we are going to explore in this study .",
    "we remark that metal abundance may not be so tightly constrained from helioseismology information .",
    "helioseismology is sensitive to the sound velocity , the change of which reads approximately @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 temperature and mean molecular weight , @xmath5 .",
    "a cancellation takes place between temperature and mean molecular weight .",
    "although the present best solar model is known to give @xmath6 as accurate as 0.2% , and the 50% change in @xmath7 might be detected if it changes with satisfying @xmath8 , the presence of @xmath9 complicates the situation .",
    "hence , it is not obvious how strong constraint can be derived on the metallicity independently of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "we take the standard solar model of bahcall and collaborators as our fiducial ( bahcall & ulrich 1988 ; bahcall & pinsonneault 1992 ; 1995 , hereafter bp95 ) , and consider a small departure from their best model .",
    "the energy of the sun is generated from the @xmath11 chain ( 98% ) and the cno cycle ( 2% ) .",
    "neutrinos are produced in @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14be@xmath15li@xmath16 and @xmath1b@xmath17be@xmath18 from the @xmath11 chain , and in beta decay of @xmath19n , @xmath20o and @xmath21f in the cno cycle .",
    "the experimental information comes from the long - running homestake experiment with @xmath22cl , which is sensitive to both high energy neutrinos ( @xmath1b neutrinos ) and intermediate energy neutrinos ( @xmath23be , @xmath24 and cno neutrinos ) ( cleveland et al .",
    "1997 ) , a water cerenkov experiment at kamiokande and superkamiokande measuring only for high energy neutrinos ( fukuda et al .",
    "1996 ; totsuka et al .",
    "1997 ) , and gallium experiment , gallex ( hampel et al . 1996 ) and sage ( abdurashitov et al . 1996 ) that are very sensitive to low energy neutrinos ( @xmath11 neutrinos ) .",
    "the problem is that the detection rate is smaller than predicted , by factors , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , this specific energy dependent suppression pattern makes the explanation of the problem by modifying the solar model highly unlikely , leaving the neutrino oscillation explanation as the most attractive possibility ( bahcall & bethe 1990 ; fukugita & yanagida 1991 ) .    indeed , this energy dependent suppression is very naturally understood by considering the conversion of electron neutrinos into other types of neutrinos inside the sun by neutrino oscillation ( mikheyev & smirnov 1986a ) . for the neutrino flux given by the standard solar model ,",
    "the current solar neutrino experiments allow two small parameter regions that are located in the two parameter space , neutrino mass - square difference @xmath28 ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) and intrinsic mixing angle ( @xmath31 ) between the two relevant neutrinos : one is called the small angle solution , in which intermediate energy neutrinos are suppressed , and the other the large angle solution , for which the suppression of neutrino fluxes is almost energy independent .",
    "the most up to date calculations are found in bahcall & krastev ( 1996 ) and in hl97 .",
    "additional information can be obtained from an upper limit on the possible flux variation between the day and night time ( day - night effect ) ( mikheyev & smirnov 1986b ; see bahcall & krastev 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "for some specific neutrino parameter range the converted muon neutrinos are changed back to electron neutrinos during the propagation through the earth , causing an increase of the neutrino capture rate in night in the kamiokande and superkamiokande detectors .",
    "the absence of this effect down to 2% level ( fukuda et al .",
    "1996 ) excludes a substantial size of parameter regions of our interest .",
    "we repeat the neutrino propagation calculation allowing for a variation in the metal abundance of the sun .",
    "we use the scaling law of bahcall & ulrich ( 1988 ) , which has given the explicit metallicity dependence for each component of the neutrino flux .",
    "the range of the model explicitly studied covers about @xmath3250% around the value of metallicity determined for the solar surface .",
    "the dependence outside this range is a simple extrapolation with power law .",
    "although this calculation is rather old , we expect the gross metallicity dependence does not differ from what one could obtain from the more modern bp95 calculation .",
    "we impose a luminosity constraint so that the luminosity that would change due to a change in the metal abundance is renormalized to the today s luminosity of the sun .",
    "namely , we study the model at fixed luminosity .",
    "the table of bahcall & ulrich shows that the most sensitive to metal abundance are indeed the cno neutrino fluxes : the power @xmath33 of the flux @xmath34 is 1.86 for the @xmath19n neutrino , 2.03 for the @xmath20o neutrino and 2.09 for the @xmath21f neutrino .",
    "this high power is caused by a multiplicative effect due to the increase of the abundance of catalysing @xmath35c and the increase of opacity that makes the core temperature higher . in spite of its sharp temperature dependence ,",
    "the effect on the @xmath1b neutrino flux is smaller ( @xmath36 ) than for the cno neutrinos .    as for the fiducial flux",
    ", we use the value of the bp95 calculation with metal diffusion effect taken into account : @xmath37 @xmath38s@xmath39 , @xmath40 snu for captures with @xmath22cl and @xmath41 snu for captures with @xmath42ga .",
    "we take 2.55@xmath43 snu for the homestake experiment ( cleveland et al .",
    "1997 ) , ( @xmath44@xmath38s@xmath39 for kamiokande ( fukuda et al .",
    "1996 ) and ( @xmath45@xmath38s@xmath39 for superkamiokande [ combined @xmath46@xmath38s@xmath39 ] ( totsuka 1997 ) , and @xmath48 snu for combined sage and gallex experiments .",
    "the absence of the day - night effect is also imposed on our data analysis . in our actual calculation",
    "we use the night - time flux data divided into 5 bins according to the cosine of angle from the sun ( fukuda et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the data are then fitted with the three free parameters , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and calculate a likelihood function taking account of both experimental errors of neutrino reaction rates and those arising from uncertainties of solar models as given by bp95 , in the same way as done in hl97 .",
    "the resulting probability distribution is displayed in fig .",
    "1 taking @xmath7 as a parameter .",
    "the range allowed at 95% confidence level ( cl ) is @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( grevesse & noels 1993 ) using the standard solar model value @xmath54 .",
    "the region outside this range is excluded even if we assume the flux reduction due to neutrino oscillation .",
    "namely , the metal abundance in the solar interior can not be much different from that in the surface .",
    "the allowed range is , of course , much larger than the change of the metal abundance induced by the diffusion effect , which is about 15% in @xmath7 ( bp95 ) .",
    "we remark that the range given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is the range where explicit solar model studies are made by bahcall and ulrich ( 1988 ) and the behaviour regarding the variation of @xmath7 is well studied ; so hindsight we need not to use power law of the @xmath7 dependence out to the range where its behaviour is not well established .",
    "we also show a figure ( fig .",
    "2 ) of allowed region for the two other parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , overlaid on the corresponding figure with the standard case ( i.e. , @xmath55 allowing for errors for the value at the surface 6.1% ) .",
    "the contour is a parameter range corresponding to 95% cl .",
    "compared with the contour of the standard model case , the allowed region is elongated horizontally for the small angle solution , or vertically for the large angle solution .",
    "most of the elongated parts ( a part in the left hand side of the small angle solution , and that in the upper part of the large angle solution ) correspond to the case with metallicity lower than the default value . for larger",
    "metallicity , the change required for the neutrino parameters is quite small to accommodate increased neutrino fluxes .",
    "nevertheless , there is a sharp cut off against the increase of metallicity , beyond which appropriate neutrino parameters do not exist to make the flux consistent with the _ three _ solar neutrino experiments . in our calculation",
    "the constraint from the absence of the day night effect serves to squeeze the high metallicity end in the large angle solution , but it plays little role for the small angle solution .",
    "we have shown that the solar neutrino experiments put a strong constraint on the metal abundance in the interior of the sun , even if we allow the neutrino oscillation due to the matter effect .",
    "namely , the possibility of neutrino oscillation does not lend us much freedom to increase metallicity inside the sun .",
    "the metallicity in the interior of the sun should not be larger than the surface value by more than 40% , or 0.15 dex in [ fe / h ] for the initial value .",
    "this is a good news to the people working for stellar evolution calculations , since we expect that the sun is not a special case , but the same probably applies to more general cases , justifying the standard assumption that stars formed by a contraction of a homogeneous gas sphere ( hayashi 1966 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the errors in the current neutrino experiments and uncertainties in nuclear reaction cross sections still allow the possibility that the metal abundance in the solar interior is slightly larger ( smaller ) than in the surface . accepting this uncertainty , energy generation from the cno cycle may be as uncertain as 0.4% to 4% of total energy generation , which is compared to 1.8% for the standard value ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . the @xmath19n or @xmath20o neutrino fluxes may vary from 1@xmath56 to 12@xmath56@xmath38s@xmath39 within this range .",
    "one might think that the @xmath19n or @xmath20o neutrino flux ( the end point energies 1.199 or 1.732 mev , respectively ) itself can give us a useful indicator for the metallicity in the solar interior due to its sensitivity to the carbon abundance .",
    "one may prepare a detector with a detection threshold set just above the energy of @xmath23be neutrinos ( 0.862 mev ) .",
    "once a new detector , which can measure @xmath23be neutrinos , e.g. , with a liquid scintillator measuring for @xmath57 , is constructed [ e.g. , borexino ( arpesella et al . 1992 ) ] , this is not difficult , since the cno neutrino flux is 100 times higher than @xmath1b neutrino flux in the standard solar model .",
    "the oscillation effect , however , makes the situation somewhat subtle . for the allowed regions of neutrino parameters",
    ", we expect the msw suppression factor for the @xmath19n neutrino flux to be 0.10.5 ( 0.40.7 ) for the small ( large ) angle solution for a given metallicity . unless this large uncertainty arising from neutrino oscillation is reduced , the @xmath19n flux does not give us useful information on the metallicity .",
    "we find that the most effective way to reduce this uncertainty is to measure gallium capture rate as precise as possible .",
    "if the error attached to gallium capture rate is reduced , the region shrinks in the vertical ( horizontal ) direction for the small ( large ) angle solution , i.e. , the error in the suppression factor is reduced . a @xmath1b neutrino flux measurement via the neutral current interaction planned at sudbury , when combined with a better gallium experiment , serves to further reduce the error in the suppression factor for a given metallicity ( although this experiment alone is not very effective for our purpose ) .",
    "for instance , if one achieves an error of the gallium experiment as small as @xmath58 snu around the current best value and measure the @xmath1b neutrino neutral current reaction to a 10% accuracy , we would obtain @xmath59 at 95% cl , if the small angle solution is right , or @xmath60 if the large angle solution is correct ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "we have argued that solar neutrino experiments have given unique information for the metals in the solar interior , which is not accessible by other means .",
    "assuming that the sun is not special , this removes our worry that metal abundance in the stellar interior might be different from that in the surface .",
    "for example , this can be an issue in deriving metallicity dependence of the cepheid period - luminosity relation , for which the metal effect on the colour , which is affected by surface metal abundance , cancels to a large degree against that on the luminosity , which is affected by metal abundance in the core of the sun ( stothers 1988 ) .",
    "if metallicity would be different in these two places , the large cancellation no longer takes place , resulting in a much larger metallicity dependence in the cepheid period - luminosity relation . the present analysis ,",
    "if our result applies to star formation from molecular clouds in general , implies that the metallicity difference , at least , is not a likely possibility to account for a large metallicity dependence of the cepheid period luminosity relation suggested recently ( gould 1994 ; sasselov et al .",
    "1997 ; sekiguchi & fukugita 1997 ) .",
    "we have also discussed that one could reduce the error in @xmath61 to a level of 1020% with further improvement in some specific solar neutrino experiments . at this level , the effect of metal diffusion could be seen with the solar neutrino experiments , opening a possibility to carry out a cross check with the result from helioseismology .",
