    "these objects are put together into an orbital system , the parameters of which are the period and the inclination with respect to the observer s line of sight . to avoid degeneracy in the best - fit solution ,",
    "we assume a perfectly circular orbit .",
    "the program then uses vector addition to determine whether any point on the star is eclipsed by any part of the secondary or disk as seen by the observer .",

    "due to a systematic variation in the error , which was consistently larger for dimmer points in the light curve , resulting in overfitting in the ingress and egress regions of the eclipse and underfitting in the central regions , all errors were set equal to the median value of 0.02 mag .",
    "the free parameters are the orientation of the disk ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , the dimensions of the disk ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , and the inclination of the orbit . if the model is of a flared gas disk rather than a flat dust disk , the inner radius is automatically set to the dust sublimation radius , but additional parameters are also allowed to vary : the density power law 1 @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 ) , the secondary mass 0.15 @xmath1@xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath60 0.38 @xmath1whose bounds were determined by calculating the hill radius ( see equations ( [ eqn : hill ] ) and ( [ eqn : secmass ] ) ) , and the disk mass @xmath62 , which was varied on a logarithmic scale of @xmath63 , where @xmath64 log@xmath65 . at the present time we are unable to constrain the mass opacity of the disk matter , so we adopt a realistic opacity from @xcite of @xmath66 m@xmath67kg@xmath6 which would correspond to the @xmath4-band mass opacity of a population of compact dust particles with composition representative of interstellar dust , grain sizes between 10@xmath68 and 10@xmath6 m following a size@xmath69 power - law distribution .",

    "the transiting dust is clearly not gray , and likely is reflecting a power - law distribution of dust grains down to submicron size , not too unlike an interstellar dust grains population .",

    "this simple disk produced a model light curve that was a reasonable visual fit to the data , with @xmath76 of @xmath77 .    a slightly more complex model for the debris disk allowed the optical depth to vary according to a power law , which produced a best fit model with @xmath56 = 26.1 @xmath71 , an outer radius of @xmath57 = 44.8 @xmath71 , a disk tilt of @xmath78 , a disk obliquity of @xmath79 from edge - on , an orbital inclination of @xmath80 , and an optical depth of @xmath81 at the inner edge of the disk which varied according to a power law of @xmath82 .",

    "the infinitely thin debris disk model captures the overall light curve structure relatively well , but has some trouble matching the data in the central regions of the eclipse ( see figure [ fig : model ] ) .      since the lack of detailed substructure indicates the possibility that the eclipses are due to a disk with non - negligible scale height , we next attempted to fit the light curve with a flared gas and dust disk model . assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , the scale height of such a disk is given by @xcite :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the sound speed    @xmath86    and , assuming circular keplerian orbits , @xmath87 is the rotation rate    @xmath88    which gives a scale height of    @xmath89    the temperature profile can be simplified for modeling purposes . given the size of the disk , the outer disk is almost certainly dominated by heating from the primary star , as we discuss in section 3.5 , putting it at a temperature of @xmath90 @xmath31 1100k .",

    "<S> we investigate the nature of the unusual eclipsing star ogle lmc - ecl-11893 ( ogle j05172127 - 6900558 ) in the large magellanic cloud recently reported by dong _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> the eclipse period for this star is 468 days , and the eclipses exhibit a minimum of @xmath01.4 mag , preceded by a plateau of @xmath00.8 mag . </S>",
    "<S> spectra and optical / ir photometry are consistent with the eclipsed star being a lightly reddened b9iii star of inferred age @xmath0150 myr and mass @xmath04 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the disk appears to have an outer radius of @xmath00.2 au with predicted temperatures of @xmath01100 - 1400k . </S>",
    "<S> we model the eclipses as being due to either a transiting geometrically thin dust disk or gaseous accretion disk around a secondary object ; the debris disk produces a better fit . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on the origin of such a dense circumstellar dust disk structure orbiting a relatively old low - mass companion , and on the similarities of this system to the previously discovered ee cep . </S>"
