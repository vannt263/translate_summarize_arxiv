    "accretion discs are found around several kind of astrophysical objects : from young stars ( protoplanetary discs ) to supermassive black holes in agns .",
    "the dynamics of these discs is however poorly understood .",
    "accretion process is penetrated itself in various ways depending on that how angular momentum of the discs it carries away and how the its energy is dissipated .",
    "such systems typically under the effect of several physical process .",
    "it is known that , on average , matter moves inward resulting in the accretion of material onto the central object and powers the most luminous objects in the universe by converting gravitational potential energy into highly energetic radiation .",
    "accretion disc forms when gaseous matter , usually an assembly of free electrons and various types of ions , spirals onto a central gravitating body by gradually losing its initial angular momentum effectively in a timescales compatible with observations , as a result of viscous and magnetic stresses .",
    "the energy released by accretion discs depends on the mass accretion rate as well as spin and mass of central black hole .",
    "there is a maximum value for luminosity ( eddington luminosity ) of accretion disc which gravity is able to exceed the outward pressure of radiation .",
    "the theory of black hole accretion disc has been developed rapidly since 1970s and brings a lot of successes in describing high - energy astronomical phenomena ( see for a review kato et al .",
    "2008 ) . as for thermally stable black hole accretion disc models",
    ", there are only three classes have been developed .",
    "the fist one is the standard shakura @xmath0 sunyaev disc , which is optically thick and geometrically thin , keplerian rotation with very small infall velocity , and truncated at the marginally stable orbit .",
    "the standard disc was studied for the newtonian case ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) and for the relativistic case ( e.g. , novikov & thorne 1973 ) .",
    "the second one is the optically thin adafs ( advection dominated accretion flows ) that works very well for small mass - accretion rates ( narayan & yi 1994 ) while for supercritical accretion discs ( @xmath1 ) slim discs was introduces ( abramowicz et al .",
    "@xmath2 is the critical mass accretion rate , defined by @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are the eddington luminosity and light speed , respectively .",
    "therefore this disc brightness about eddington or super - eddington luminosity and the geometrical thickness can not ignore ( @xmath6 ) ( abramowicz et al .",
    "the slim disc models describes supercritical disc accretion flow , so they are identical to each other .",
    "recently the slim disc model began to attract considerable attention , because of its success to reproduce spectra of accreting binaries .",
    "the spectral behaviour of several black hole binaries can not be explained by the traditional standard disc , but is well reproduced by slim disc models ( kubota 2001 ) .",
    "lmc x-3 is black hole ( bh ) binary system in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) at a distance of 48.1 kpc ( derived from orosz et al .",
    "cowley et al . ( 1983 ) stablished lmc x-3 as a bh condidate with a bh mass @xmath7 .",
    "lmc x-1 has a soft spectra and a low absorption column density along the line of sight .",
    "these properties make lmc x-3 an ideal sample for testing our understanding of black hole accretion disc physics .",
    "slim disk model describes accretion flows at high luminosities , while reducing to the standard thin disk in the low luminusity limit .",
    "the most important feature of super critical accretion flows is the presence of photon trapping as the advection of radiation entropy .",
    "the slim disc will exceed eddington limit , because the accretion rate can be larger than eddington accretion rate ( mineshige et al .",
    "2000 , ohsuga et al .",
    "the basic stucture and spectral properties of the slim disks have been examined by several researchers : watarai & fukue ( 1999 ) showed the existence of radiative winds from the superdisk , mineshige et al ( 2000 ) applied slim disks to the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "fukue ( 2000 ) examined the basic properties of super critical accretion discs and derived the relations between the observables and the model parameters .",
    "several physical process should be take into account when we are studying black hole accretion disc . magnetic field palys a great role on the structure of the disc since in hot accreting flow ,",
    "the temperature is so high that the accreting materials are ionized .",
    "many researcher have been attack the problem to solve the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations of hot magnetized flow analytically ( akizuki & fukue 2006 , abbassi et al .",
    "2008 , ghanbari et al 2007 , shadmehri & khajenabi 2005 ) .",
    "kaburaki ( 2000 ) has presented a set of analytical solutions for a hot accretion flow in a global magnetic field .",
    "ghanbari et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have presented a set of self - similar solutions for two - dimensional ( 2d ) viscous - resistive adafs in the presence of a dipolar magnetic field of the central accretor .",
    "they have shown that the presence of a magnetic field and its associated resistivity can considerably change the picture with regard to accretion flows .",
    "one of the largely neglected physical process in the physics of accretion discs is thermal conduction ; hot accretion flows have high temperature , so the internal energy per particle is high .",
    "this is one of the reasons why advection cooling overcomes radiative cooling . for the same reason turbulence heat transport by thermal conduction",
    "is non - negligible in heat balance in the disc ( kato et al .",
    "2008 ) . while some recent observations ( loewenstein et al . 2001 ; di matteo et al . 2003 ; ho et al .",
    "2003 ) of the hot accretion flow around active galactic nuclei indicated that it should be on collision - less regime .",
    "so thermal conduction has a great role in energy transport in the accreting materials in a hot accretion disc where they are completely ionized .",
    "the weekly - collisional nature of hot acceretion flows has been noted before ( mahadevan @xmath8 quataret 1997 ) . since thermal conduction act to oppose the formation of the temperature gradient that causes it , that might expect that the temperature profile in a thermal conducting disc should be differ from the case of the disc was not under the influence of thermal conduction .",
    "shadmehri ( 2008 ) , abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) , tanaka @xmath9 menou ( 2006 ) have studied the effect of hot accretion flow with thermal conduction in a semi - analytical method ; physics of such systems have been studied in simulation models ( e.g. sharma et al .",
    "2008 ; wu et al .",
    "abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that for this problem there are two types of solutions ; high and low accretion rate .",
    "ghasemnezhad et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have shown , by putting an extra physical condition have shown that the high accretion rate solutions of abbassi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are not exactly correct as long as some of the low accretion rate solutions are not physical meaning .",
    "this extra condition make a acceptable parameter space which in this space the self - similar solutions has reasonable physical behaviour .",
    "following gka12 we are investigating the observational appearance a hot magnetized flow under effect of thermal conduction using fukue ( 2004 ) framework in a parameter space presented by gka12 .",
    "we developed fukue ( 2004 ) solutions for narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies by adding the thermal conduction and toroidal magnetic field effect .",
    "we suppose a moderately massive central black holes @xmath10 under critical accretion rate @xmath11 ( e.g.,minishige et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 , we present the equations of magnetohydrodynamics as the basic equations and assumptions .",
    "self - similar solutions are presented in section 3 . in section 4 , the continuum spectra are calculated and we regard general properties of supercritical discs and ultimately we show the results in section 5 .",
    "for constructing the model , we used a set of coupled differential equations describing the law of conservation for a steady state , axi - symmetric ( @xmath12 ) supercritical accretion disc . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath13 , we used vertically integrate the flow equations , also , we suppose that all variables are only a function of @xmath14 .",
    "we ignore the relativistic effect and we use newtonian gravity .",
    "we adopt @xmath15-prescription for viscosity of accreting flow .",
    "the magnetic field was considered with toroidal configurations .",
    "the mhd equations are as the same as ( akizuki & fukue 2006 , abbassi et al .",
    "2008 , gka12 ) : @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19=(1+\\beta)c_s^{2}\\ ] ] @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the accretion velocity ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the surface density at a cylindrical radius @xmath14 , @xmath25 is the mass loss rate per unit volume , h is the disc half - thickness .",
    "the azimuthal equation of motion was integreated over @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath15 is the viscous parameter , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the angular velocity and the keplerian angular speed respectively .    in this equation",
    "we have introduced @xmath29 which is magnetic field pressure over the gas pressure which indicates the importance of magnetic field in the dynamics of accretion flow and it is a free parameter in our model . following ( gka12 ) radiative pressure",
    "is ignored but it should take into account in the case of slim disc to have more realistic picture . as the same as akizuki & fukue 2006 , abbassi et al 2008 and gka12 we can chose two cases : case 1 : when the pressure is assumed to be the gas pressure ( thermal pressure ) .",
    "case 2 : when the pressure is assumed to be the magnetic pressure plus the gas pressure .",
    "so in the case 2 we replace @xmath15 whit @xmath30 in all of the equations . for simplicity in this investigation",
    "we use the case 1 .",
    "we will follow how will change is not here the dynamical and observational properties of the disc will change when the @xmath31 varies is a physically reasonable interval . in the energy equation we have cooling and heating term in the disc .",
    "we assume the generated energy due to viscous dissipation plus the heat conducted into the volume are balanced by the advection cooling .",
    "the second term on right hand side of the energy equation represents energy transfer due to the thermal conduction where @xmath32 is the saturated conduction flux ( cowie & makee 1977 ) .",
    "dimensionless coefficient @xmath33 is less than unity .",
    "the induction equation ( the final one ) represents the interaction of fluid and magnetic field . where @xmath34 is the field scaping / creating rate due to magnetic instability or dynamo effect .     for several values of ( top panel : magnetic field ( @xmath31 ) , middle panel : advction parameter ( @xmath35),bottom panel : thermal conduction ( @xmath36)).,width=302 ]    ) , middle panel : advction parameter ( @xmath35),bottom panel : magnetic field ( @xmath31)).,width=302 ]     for @xmath37 ( solid lines ) , @xmath38 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath39 ( dotted lines),width=302 ]    , @xmath40 ) , @xmath37 ( solid lines ) , @xmath39 ( dashed lines),width=302 ]",
    "to solve the mhd equations which they are introduced in last section and have physical interpretation of a hot accretion flow under effect of thermal conduction and toroidal magnetic field , we seek self - similar solutions of the above mhd equations .",
    "the self - similar method is familiar from its wide applications in astrophysics and it s abilities to solve the full set of mhd equations .",
    "usefulness of the self - similar method is simplifying multi - dimensional problems of geometric and kinematic complexity , making them analytically tractable .",
    "the self - similar method is not able to reproduce the exact solution of accretion flows , because no boundary conditions have been taken into account .",
    "however , as long as we are not interested in the behaviour of the flow near the boundaries , such solutions are very useful . following gka12 solutions we have introduce the velocities as follows    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and constant @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are determined later from the magnetohydrodynamic equations . from eq .",

( 2008 ) . in this work we focus on constant accretion rate ( no outflow ) case but for @xmath65",
    "there is wind or outflow and accretion rate is not constant .",
    "the observation evidence shows that the outflow can exist in adaf ( like @xmath66 ) and slim disc ( like seyfert 1 sources ) .",
    "the properties of outflow examined by xie & yuan ( 2008 ) , yuan , wu , bu 2012 , yuan , bu , wu 2012 for adaf , and ohsuga , mineshige , et al .",
    "2009 for adaf , ssd and slim discs .",
    "the outflow will affect the dynamics , and the radiative output of the accretion disc ( xie & yuan 2012 ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath46 which is determine the behaviour of the radial flow is specified by the input parameter of the fluid such as @xmath15 , @xmath33 , @xmath31 and @xmath35 .",
    "if we @xmath46 achieve from the above equation then we can easily have @xmath47 and @xmath47 by : @xmath67\\ ] ] @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{2 } } c_1^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] @xmath69    gka12 by adding one more constrain on solution presented by abbassi et al 2008 , have shown the this new physical condition places a constraint on the physically valid parametric space .",
    "their calculations are carried out in a range of viscosities , thermal conduction , and magnetic field parameters which they have acceptable physical behaviour .",
    "gka12 have presented dynamical behaviour of such flows by plotting @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . in this paper",
    "we want to further explore this system to investigate the possible role of thermal conduction and magnetic field on the observational appearance of hot magnetized flow . in the next section",
    "we will follow this idea .",
    "we have a complete set of equations which describe the global dynamics of hot magnetized flow . using the results obtained in the previous section we will able reproduce observational appearance of the hot magnetized flow .",
    "the surface flux and disc luminosity of the discs are derived as follow : by assuming a dominance of the radiation pressure , we can write the height - integrated pressure @xmath70 and the averaged flux f as : @xmath71    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the stefan - boltzman constant . the optical thickness of the disc as the same as height - integrated pressure and averaged flux has a radial dependency as :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the electron - scattering opacity and schwarzschild respectively .    hence , the effective flux and the effective temperature of the disc surface become : @xmath77 @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the eddington luminosity .    by integrating these equations radially we will have the disc luminosity as : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( fukue , 2000 ) .",
    "this equation represents , the disc s luminosity which is affected by magnetic field explicitly through the @xmath31 , but it would be affected by thermal conduction , advection parameter and viscosity through the @xmath84 implicitly .    the simplest spectral model we can construct for an accretion disc if we assume the inflowing matter in a thermal equilibrium .",
    "we have assumed the accretion flow radiates away locally like a black - body radiation .",
    "we expect that the hottest regions at small @xmath14 to radiate at the highest energies .",
    "this simple spectral model is referred to as the multi - colour disc . for the present purpose",
    ", we assume that the disc surface radiates black - body radiation @xmath85 with temperature @xmath86 . then we can equate the disk radiative flux @xmath87 to a black body flux @xmath88 where @xmath86 is the surface temperature .",
    "since @xmath89 , we can equate radiative flux @xmath90 .",
    "then , the continuum spectrum ( luminosity per frequency ) @xmath91 can be calculated ( see , e.g. , kato et al . 1998 ) by : @xmath92 where a factor 2 comes from that the radiation will radiated from both side of the disc .",
    "we will integereated luminocity in a resonable interval : @xmath93 .",
    "we have used black - body function :    @xmath94    the disc is believed to be fundamentally antisymmetric . when viewed at an angle other than face - on ( from above or below the plane exactly ) , the circular disc appears elliptical .",
    "the greater the ellipticity , the more the galaxy s disc in inclined with respect to our line of sight . here",
    "we are studding of disc viewed at different inclinations .",
    "observed flux from an accretion disc depends on the distance @xmath95 and it s inclination angle @xmath96 as : @xmath97 * this equation can be used for standard discs . *     for several values of ( top panel : magnetic field ( @xmath31 ) , middle panel : advction parameter ( @xmath35),bottom panel : thermal conduction ( @xmath36)).,width=302 ]    ) , middle panel : advction parameter ( @xmath35),bottom panel : magnetic field ( @xmath31)).,width=302 ]     and lmc x-3 with @xmath98 for the two thermal conduction parameter @xmath37 , @xmath39,width=302 ]",
    "in this section we apply the present model of hot magnetized accretion disc to two astronomical objects , including an accretion disc around a black hole , which are supposed to be under critical accretion : lmc x-3 and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "lmc x-3 is a powerful source of x - rays located in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "this x - ray source is associated with a binary system with an orbital period of 1.7 days ( close binary ) .",
    "the visible component is a main sequence b3 star whose shape has been severely distorted by the gravitational field of its companion . although not unambiguous , the mass of the compact object is estimated to be order of 10 solar masses and more likely is considerably higher , making this one of the best black hole candidates .",
    "we used lmc x-3 values to test our model .    in figure 1 the surface temperature ( @xmath99 ) is plotted as a function of the dimensionless radius ( @xmath100 ) for lmc x-3 .",
    "it is obvious that the surface temperature decreases as @xmath100 increases .",
    "the top panel shows the effect of magnetic field on the surface temperature .",
    "we see that the surface temperature decreases by adding magnetic field parameter @xmath31 . in the middle panel",
    "we show that surface temperature increases by increasing advection parameter . and finally in the lower panel we have plotted surface temprature as a function of radial distance for several values of thermal conduction parameter , @xmath101 .",
    "slope of the temperature gradient decreases when we add the role of thermal conduction , by adding @xmath101 , as expected .",
    "this is acceptable because the increasing of thermal conduction causes that the more energy transfers to outer of disc and so reduce the temperature gradient . to having this panel",
    "we just used physically allowed parameter space which was introduced by gka12 .",
    "the radiation spectrum of the hot magnetized flow is shown in figure 2 for several values of thermal conduction , advection parameter and magnetic field from top to bottom .",
    "the central black - hole mass is fixed as @xmath102 , while the mass accretion - rate @xmath103 is equal @xmath104 . as can be seen in figure 2",
    ", the maximum of @xmath105 is always of the order of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this agrees with fukue ( 2004 ) and observed value of lmc x-3 .",
    "as we see by increasing of thermal conduction , the surface temperature decreases and therefore luminosity of disc also decreases .",
    "but advection parameter acts oppose to thermal conduction .",
    "we expect that by decreasing the advection parameter , @xmath35 , more energy radiated away so the total luminosity will be higher while we see the opposite result in figure 2 and 6 , seems this behavior comes from the lack of radiation pressure .",
    "so this results indicate that in ordetr to have a realistic picture we should add the radiation pressure in the dynamics of hot magnetized flow .",
    "we plotted the observed flux of lmc x-3 for inclination angle @xmath107 for different values of thermal conduction in figure 3 . in figure 3,4",
    "we evaluate the effect of thermal conduction on the observed flux .",
    "figure 4 we have shown that by increasing the inclination angle @xmath96 for two thermal conduction parameters , the radiation spectrum of the disc @xmath108 will increase . in both of two inclination angles we can easily see by increasing of thermal conduction @xmath36 , the observed flux decreases . in this panel",
    "we have the same result with figure 2 .",
    "the classical soft - state spectrum of the x - ray binary lmc x-3 in dominated by a @xmath109 .",
    "this result agrees with straub et al .",
    "davis et al . ( 2006 ) , have plotted the spectrum of lmc x-3 for @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and they have shown that the observed flux is approximately @xmath112 and the peak of the spectrum is located in @xmath113 .",
    "the same panels are shown for narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies in figure 5 , 6 .",
    "seyfert galaxies are characterized by extremely bright nuclei , and spectra which have very bright emission lines of hydrogen , helium , nitrogen , and oxygen .",
    "these x - ray emission may come from the surface of the accretion disc itself .",
    "the central black hole mass is @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in figure 5 as can be seen for this object temperature is lower than lmc x-3 .",
    "this result is according to the result of abramowicz et al.(1988 ) .",
    "we show in figure 6 the maximum of @xmath105 is always of the order of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath116 ) and disc spectrum is peaking up @xmath117 .",
    "these results are agree with fukue ( 2004 ) .    in figure 7",
    "we compared the solution for these two objects .",
    "we have shown that for the same thermal conduction parameter when the mass of bh decreases , the spectrum is setting in high frequency and high energy while the luminosity decreases and we have hard - low state .",
    "we have presented a simple study showing that self - similar solution of a hot magnetized flow under the effect of thermal conduction .",
    "purely toroidal magnetic field configuration is assumed .",
    "it was assumed the disc is axially symmetric and static with the @xmath15-prescription of viscosity .",
    "the relativistic effects and self - gravity of the disc are ignored .",
    "the weak collisional nature of a hot accretion flow was confirmed by ( tanaka & menou 2006 ; abbassi et al .",
    "2008 ) , so we have adopted a saturated form of thermal conduction as a possible mechanism for energy transportation .",
    "observational appearance of such disc was investigated with a physically limited parameter space presented by gka12 .",
    "gka12 imposed condition puts some physical constraint on self - similar solutions presented by abbassi et al 2008 . as a result , in order to have a physically valid solution , only a small part of the parameter space should be considered . after assuring the validity of our solutions by using the proper values of input parameters @xmath15 , @xmath31 , @xmath101 and f we have investigated the influence of thermal conduction on the observational appearance of hot magnetized accretion flows .",
    "it is shown that the temperature gradient will decrease when thermal conduction plays an important role .",
    "increases when thermal conduction plays an important role .",
    "radiation spectrum of the hot magnetized flow was plotted for two real cases : narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies and x - ray binary lmc x-3 .",
    "the theoretical solution is compatible with observed x - ray spectra of these two cases .",
    "so far we have considered only the most basic of hot magnetized flow : one - fluid , axially symmetric , and steady .",
    "the real hot magnetized flow is a much richer medium , providing numerous examples of important astrophysical phenomena on all scales .",
    "thus , if we assume a two - temperature structure for the ions and electrons in the discs , then we may expect that the ions and electron temperatures decouple in the inner regions where is so hot , which will modify the role of conduction consequently will modify the dynamical and observational appearance of the disc .",
    "one of the other limitation of this solution is the anisotropic character of conduction in the presence of a magnetic field which is indicated by balbus ( 2001 ) .",

    "<S> we examine the effect of thermal conduction on the observational properties of a super critical hot magnetized flow . we obtained self - similar solution of a magnetized disc when the thermal conduction plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> follow of our first paper ( ghasemnezhad et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2012 ( hereafter gka12 ) ) we have extended our solution on the observational appearance of the disc to show how physical condition such as thermal conduction , viscosity , and advection will change the observed luminosity of the disc , continuous spectra and surface temperature of such discs was plotted . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the present model to black - hole x - ray binary lmc x-3 and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , which are supposed to be under critical accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> our results show clearly that the surface temperature is strongly depends on the thermal conduction , the magnetic field and advection parameter . </S>",
    "<S> however we see that thermal conduction acts to oppose the temperature gradient as we expect and observed luminosity of the disc will reduce when thermal conduction is high . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that in this model the spectra of critical accretion flows strongly depends on the inclination angle . </S>"
