    "the field equations in the four dimensional einstein gravity can be obtained from the einstein - hilbert action which is linear in the riemann tensor .",
    "these equations of motion determine how the matter fields act as a source for curvature .",
    "unfortunately , there is no elegant principle to determine these field equations of gravity .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to study the most general system of field equations which are second order in the independent variables and which satisfy the criteria of general covariance .",
    "further , it can also be speculated that the einstein - hilbert action , which is only an effective gravitational action valid for small curvatures at low energies , will certainly undergo a modification by higher derivative interactions in any attempt to perturbatively quantize gravity as a field theory @xcite .",
    "these observations lead us to a class of models first proposed by lanczos @xcite and lovelock @xcite .",
    "the field equations for these models can be derived from an action functional in d - dimensions @xcite which is a polynomial in the curvature tensor .",
    "when d=4 , the action becomes the standard einstein - hilbert action ( for a recent review on lanczos - lovelock gravity , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the quasi linearity feature of the einstein - lovelock equations of motion guarantees that they can be formulated as a cauchy problem with some constraints on the initial data @xcite and also renders the quantization of the linearized lanczos - lovelock theory as ghost - free @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have revealed that the lanczos - lovelock models are motivated by the intimate connection between gravitational dynamics and horizon thermodynamics .",
    "this connection was established by the pioneering work of bekenstein , hawking , davies , unruh and others showing that horizons in general possess thermodynamic properties like entropy @xcite and temperature @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field equations in einstein and in more general gravity theories @xcite as well as in all the lanczos - lovelock models can be derived from a thermodynamical extremum principle @xcite and the action functional itself can be given a thermodynamic interpretation .",
    "consequently , the emergent gravity paradigm ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) which enables us to think of space - time as some sort of fluid with its thermodynamic properties arising from the dynamics of underlying `` atoms of space - time '' , has gained momentum in recent years .",
    "such studies have also unravelled several peculiar geometrical features of lanczos - lovelock models @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "universal thermodynamics in lanczos - lovelock gravity has been studied using extended hawking temperature on the horizon ( event/ apparent ) and modified horizon entropy .",
    "the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) and thermodynamical equilibrium ( te ) have been examined for three choices of the cosmic fluid namely , + i ) perfect fluid with constant equation of state , + ii ) the modified chaplygin gas , + and iii ) the holographic dark energy .",
    "+ in each case , the first and the second derivatives of the entropy on the horizon ( event/ apparent ) have been expressed and due to complicated expressions , they have been plotted against relevant parameters in the respective fluid models , for different space - time dimensions . in the holographic dark energy case , the values for the parameters c and @xmath0",
    "have been obtained from three planck data sets presented in table 2 .",
    "finally , the constraints on the parameters involved have been presented in tabular form .",
    "the lagrangian density of lanczos - lovelock gravity consists of the dimensionally extended euler densities which are given by @xcite @xmath1}c_il_i\\ ] ] where @xmath2 s are constants , d is the space - time dimension and @xmath3 s are the euler densities of 2i - dimensional manifolds and are defined by @xmath4 the symbol @xmath5 denotes a totally antisymmetric product of kronecker deltas defined as @xmath6}\\ ] ] here the generalized kronecker delta symbol is totally antisymmetric in both sets of indices .",
    "the action for lanczos - lovelock gravity is given by @xmath7}c_il_i+s_{matter}\\ ] ] following from the variation of this action , the gravitational equation is written in a compact form : @xmath8}c_ig^i_{ab}=k_d^2t_{ab}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is deduced from the variation of @xmath3 and @xmath10 is the energy - momentum tensor for matter fields obtained from the matter action @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is set to 1 so that the constant @xmath13 is proportional to the cosmological constant",
    ". @xmath14 gives the usual curvature scalar term .",
    "the constant @xmath15 must be positive in order that the einstein s general relativity in the low energy limit be recovered .",
    "@xmath16 is the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "although the lagrangian l consists of some higher derivative curvature terms , the lanczos - lovelock gravity is not essentially a higher derivative gravity since its equations of motion do not contain terms with more than second derivatives of metric .",
    "this reason makes the lanczos - lovelock gravity free of ghost @xcite .",
    "let us consider a ( n+1 ) dimensional homogeneous and isotropic frw metric as @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the area radius , @xmath19 is the metric of 2 space ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 denotes flat , open or closed universe .    the radius of the event horizon ( @xmath22 ) and that of the apparent horizon ( @xmath23 ) can be expressed as    @xmath24    @xmath25    respectively , where @xmath26 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the surface gravity ( @xmath27 ) @xcite on any horizon is given by @xmath28 which can be evaluated to give @xmath29 i.e. , @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "using this form of surface gravity , the extended hawking temperature is defined as @xcite , @xmath32 now the unified first law ( ufl ) can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total energy inside a sphere of radius @xmath35 and is termed as misner - sharp energy @xcite ( here @xmath36 ) . a ( = @xmath37 )",
    "is the area of the horizon and v ( = @xmath38 ) is the volume enclosed by the horizon .",
    "the energy flux @xmath39 is termed as the energy supply vector and w is the work function .",
    "they are defined as @xmath40 respectively , where @xmath10 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the validity of gslt and te can be examined by the following inequalities @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 as the horizon entropy and the entropy of the fluid bounded by the horizon respectively .",
    "@xmath44 can be calculated from gibb s relation @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy flow across the horizon , @xmath47 is the volume of the fluid and @xmath48 is the temperature of the fluid .    in the present work",
    ", we assume the temperature @xmath48 of the cosmic fluid ( chosen as perfect fluid with constant equation of state , modified chaplygin gas and holographic dark energy ) inside the horizon to be same as the extended hawking temperature ( @xmath49 ) of the bounding horizon .",
    "but in general , these two temperatures may not be identical .",
    "then there is a spontaneous flow of energy between the horizon and the fluid and is not consistent with frw model @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to assume @xmath50 @xcite i.e. , @xmath51 , with b as the real proportionality constant .",
    "it is to be noted that at present , the horizon temperature ( i.e. , the extended hawking temperature ) is lower than the cmb temperature by many orders of magnitude , so b is restricted as @xmath52 .",
    "however , in the perspective of local equilibrium hypothesis , there is no spontaneous flow of energy between the horizon and the fluid , so it is reasonable to assume @xmath53 .",
    "further due to mathematical complexity of non - equilibrium thermodynamical prescription , the assumption of equilibrium ( though restrictive ) is widely used in the literature @xcite .",
    "moreover , it should be mentioned that this restrictive situation is suitable at the late stages of the universe when the cosmic fluid and the horizon will interact for a long time @xcite .",
    "now from @xmath54 , the time variation of the entropy of the fluid is given by @xmath55",
    "the friedmann equation of frw universe in lanczos - lovelock gravity is @xcite ( assuming g=1 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58    from ( @xmath59 ) we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 for this modified gravity theory , we shall determine the expression for horizon entropy from the validity of the unified first law of thermodynamics both for an event and an apparent horizon .      for the present model",
    "the energy flux vector can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65    we consider the tangent vector to the surface of event horizon as @xcite @xmath66    now projecting the ufl along @xmath67 , the first law of thermodynamics of the event horizon is obtained as @xcite @xmath68 the matter energy supply @xmath69 , when projected on the event horizon gives the heat flow @xmath70 in the clausius relation ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "so from @xmath72 , we have @xmath73    now using equations ( @xmath74 ) , and the extended hawking temperature on the event horizon and comparing with the clausius relation and integrating , the entropy on the event horizon can be evaluated as    @xmath75    similarly for the apparent horizon , considering @xcite @xmath76 as the tangent vector to the surface of the apparent horizon , the expression for the entropy becomes , @xmath77    from equations ( [ ehe ] ) and ( [ ahe ] ) we see that the entropy at the horizon ( event/ apparent ) is no longer the usual bekenstein entropy , rather there are correction terms with the bekenstein s area formula .",
    "due to complicated expressions , the correction terms are only presented in integral form .",
    "now the time derivative of the total entropy ( i.e. , entropy of the horizon+ entropy of the fluid ) are given by ( for simplicity flat space - time has been considered ) , @xmath78-\\frac{n(n-1)\\omega_nr_e^{n-2}v_a}{2(2-v_a)}.\\ ] ] @xmath79+\\frac{n(n-1)\\omega_n r_a^{n-2}v_a(v_a-1)}{2(2-v_a)}.\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the velocities of the apparent and event horizon respectively and @xmath82 and @xmath83 . + again taking the time derivative of @xmath84 and @xmath85 we have @xmath86 -\\frac{n(n-1)\\omega_n}{2}\\left[\\frac{r_e^{n-2}v_a}{2-v_a}\\{\\frac{n-2}{r_e}v_e+\\frac{f_a}{v_a}+\\frac{f_a}{2-v_a}\\}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath87 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{n(n-1)\\omega_n}{2}\\left[\\frac{r_a^{n-2}v_a(v_a-1)}{2-v_a}\\left(\\frac{n-2}{r_a}v_a+f_a\\{\\frac{1}{v_a}+\\frac{1}{v_a-1}+\\frac{1}{2-v_a}\\}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the acceleration of the event and apparent horizon respectively .",
