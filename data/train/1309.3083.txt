    "<S> the central density of polaritons is initially 550  @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> for the first few ps , the fluid only slightly decreases its total number of particles  due to radiative losses  however , at @xmath9 ps , the maximum density suffers a sudden depletion , down to only a quarter of the initial density . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in panels ( e , f ) for the intensity and ( g , h ) for the phase . </S>",
    "<S> this unanticipated jolt marks the beginning of the redistribution of the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> note that the phase space profile starts to manifest a negative curvature with a reversal point of the phase gradient ( @xmath10 ) at @xmath11 m . </S>",
    "<S> such an inversion in the phase gradient is an indication of a change in the fluid direction , from waves expanding outwards , to contracting towards the centre . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is then followed by the appearance of the bright and sharp central peak , contoured by concentric rings ( i , j ) . </S>",
    "<S> this central peak collects 6% of the total particles still present in the fluid , and is surprisingly brighter than the initial spot was in the same area ( here by a factor of two , up to ten times in other realizations , see supplementary fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the peak is furthermore extremely robust as it occurs over the whole sample area , at different mc / qw detunings and even sustains motion , as it actually propagates if imparted with an initial momentum ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed in the time - integrated camera images of the direct emission before any subsequent digital elaboration , which excludes any artifact of the technique ( see also fig . </S>",

    "<S> are shown the amplitude and phase profiles versus time [ panels ( a ) and ( b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude chart reveals the bright peak as a central horizontal line which reaches its maximum intensity at a time of @xmath1311 ps . the vertical stripes observed in the first 5 - 6  ps are rabi oscillations between the excitonic and photonic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the period of @xmath14  fs corresponds to the energy separation between the upb and lpb of 5.4 mev , while their fast decay is due to the rapid scattering of the upb polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> the rabi oscillations are triggered by the femtosecond pulse that excites simultaneously both polariton branches ( 9 nm energy width , see also supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 and ref .  </S>",

    "<S> they do not , however , play an important role in the observed phenomenology , since the dynamical localization also happens under the excitation of the lpb alone by a picosecond laser pulse ( 0.35 nm width , see supplementary fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this confirms the robustness of this peak . since it has an homogeneous phase , as can be seen from the phase graph in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , it is a standing wave . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that a neat time - space cone marks a boundary between two regions : an expanding internal domain with almost horizontal black and white ( b / w ) bands ( strong inward @xmath15 ) and an external domain with almost vertical b / w bands ( null or weak @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a clear evidence that a circular front of phase disturbance ( marked also by a low density ) is expanding ( @xmath16m / ps ) , leaving after its passage a fragmentation into multiple rings , as illustrated in the still image of panel  ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> if an attractive term is at play here , it thus seems to be in the course of expanding its range of action . to further characterize the flow dynamics and its role in the formation of the central peak </S>",
    "<S> , we extend our study to the reciprocal space , reporting the 1d cross section of the @xmath17 plane in panel ( c ) of figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial @xmath18 width of the polariton population created by the laser pulse is very small ( @xmath19 fwhm ) and concentrated around @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> after a couple of picoseconds , the fluid suddenly ejects a disk in @xmath21-space which stabilizes within 10  ps into a ring at finite momenta around @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> these are clearly associated to the inner growing flow . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the onset of the rabi oscillations allows us to make a correspondence between real and reciprocal space , indicating that the central bright peak in real space is associated to the finite momenta travelling waves in reciprocal space . </S>",

    "<S> 2(f ) , the ring in @xmath21 space gradually expands from @xmath20 at early times ( maximum blushift of the polariton pupulation ) to the value of @xmath23 when the dispersion is redshifted to its original bare energy . the space - energy profile in figure 2(e ) </S>",
    "<S> explains in part the inner flow . </S>",
    "<S> here it is clear that the central part of the spot is redshifted with respect to the sides , hinting at the presence of an effective attractive potential responsible for the central peak of high polariton density . </S>",
    "<S> although it is not clear at the outset what the origin of such a potential is , it is consistent with an attractive term ( nonlinearity inversion ) or with nonlocal interactions , i.e. , @xmath21-dependent blueshift  @xcite . in our case , we may reasonably infer that the inward coherent waves generated by such a potential interfere in the center with opposite @xmath24 vectors , explaining the central accumulation enhanced by a polar scaling of @xmath25 which is typical of an interfering ring wave ( see figure s7 in the sm ) .    </S>",
    "<S> ps is shown together with the associated amplitude profile . </S>",

    "<S> soon after the phase reversal , a sudden , almost instantaneous switch happens at @xmath28  ps . </S>",
    "<S> the rigid switch is a @xmath29-jump , corresponding to the dark notch in the density , as seen in panel ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a typical sign of an interference between counterpropagating waves . in the following dynamics , </S>",
    "<S> as already said , the reversed gradient tends to grow and expand all over the originally excited area , as depicted in panel ( c ) with profiles at 5 ps intervals . </S>",
    "<S> other @xmath29-jumps in the phase can be observed at a later time , corresponding to dark rings in the density , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an evidence that interference phenomena of coherent waves are acting in reshaping the fluid density as a series of concentric rings . </S>",
    "<S> it also suggests a possible link to  without being a `` per - se '' proof of  ring dark solitons ( rds )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these specific solutions to nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlse ) under repulsive interactions are predicted to become stable in the case of 2d fluids such as polaritons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that a rds indeed holds for the first dark ring around the rising bright peak , given its stability for several tens of ps .        </S>",

    "<S> 4(a , b , c ) , the condensate behaves as expected from any fluid freely released , with a small diffusion and remaining homogeneous in both density and phase , as well as , in our case , rabi oscillations at earlier times . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that the expansion speed imparted by the small initial @xmath30 is negligible . at 5-times higher excitation power [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(d , e , f ) ] , there is a density redistribution of polaritons to form the central localization peak , surrounded by ring structures and out - radiating shock waves , however , yet without a strong enhancement and a moderate phase reversal . in fig.4(g , h , i ) , at 18 times the initial pumping power , the structure gets fully formed , with a central peak gathering over twice the population locally present at the initial time and with a much steeper phase reversal , giving rise to the striking structure in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4h . here </S>",
    "<S> again we emphasize that the central peak is resolution limited and is likely sharper than is resolved in our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> additional examples are provided in the supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s3 for an extended set of excitation densities .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss which physical mechanism could be responsible for such a remarkable phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the strong - coupling regime of light and matter at the core of the polariton physics can lead to distinctive dispersive and dissipative nonlinearities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , polaritons support dissipative solitons  @xcite , have demonstrated bistability domains with a switching on / off of both bright and dark solitons  @xcite as well as moving bright solitons along a steadily pumped background  @xcite ( this last based on the negative curvature of the polariton dispersion above the inflexion point ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these features are accountable by one of the several models used to describe polariton fluids . while the positive nonlinearities intrinsic to polariton interactions , due to the excitonic repulsions , </S>",
    "<S> are supposedly able to force the expansion and reshaping of a polariton fluid and to sustain dark solitons  @xcite , possibly shedding light to some aspect of our experiment , there is no documented mechanism to explain the most striking feature : the real - space collapse in the center of the spot . </S>",
    "<S> real space localization could in principle appear under negative , i.e. , attractive , nonlinearities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we review below all the obvious candidates to account for the observed phenomenology , we can rule out this and other tempting explanations . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis will show that the most likely origin of the nonlinear activation of a central bright spot is the self - trapping of a polariton condensate by a type of collective polaron effect .        a first possibility to explain the self - localization is for the polariton population at early times to undergo a transition to the weak coupling regime ( screening and reduction of coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this can be partially happening at the largest power ( given the excited density there is @xmath31 per qw and approaches values of the so - called mott density , in the order of @xmath32 ) , it does not explain the effect since ( i ) the blueshift of the lpb is continuous and does not reach the photonic mode ; ( ii ) increasing power / density does not increase the size of the bright peak , as expected if merely enlarging the size of an above - threshold region ; ( iii ) the total intensity decays with the lp polariton lifetime of 10  ps ( see supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 ) and ( iv ) transition to weak coupling for excitation below the band edge would manifest as a higher blueshift as follows from the nonlinear kramers - kronig relations  @xcite , while we observe a lesser blueshift in the centre with respect to the side bright ring , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(e ) . </S>",
    "<S> an exciton reservoir , separate from the polariton condensate , is known to play a significant role in many polariton experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we can exclude it in our case for the following reasons : ( i ) the effect persists when resonantly exciting the lower polariton branch , a configuration that does not populate the reservoir ( see the supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 on the picosecond experiment ) , ( ii ) a moving bright peak is observed when exciting with nonzero initial in - plane wavevector  @xmath21 , ruling out a reservoir that would need to be dragged by the structure as it propagates , which is impossible given the heavy mass of the reservoir excitons ( see the supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s6 on the moving peak ) , ( iii ) the effect does not show any strong polarization dependence . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations thus exclude the case of a dissipative bright soliton  @xcite predicted under cw pumping where the localization is sculpted by an interplay between source and decay regions and the compensation of their steady flows . the appealing recourse to attractive interactions </S>",
    "<S> can not be sustained either . </S>",
    "<S> while polariton attractions are possible due to the various superexchange processes through dark excitons or bi - exciton states , or due to van der waals forces , none of these mechanisms can account for the experiment in a careful analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the former mechanism should be strongly polarisation dependent  @xcite , which is not our case , and the latter are too small with respect to the repulsive coulomb or exchange terms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , nonlocality ( @xmath21-dependence , which could also lead to a negative dispersion in the centre of the spot  @xcite ) of one or more of these terms and even retardation effects are negligible as well  @xcite and fail to produce the real - space collapse in numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the dynamical casimir effect  @xcite recently proposed  @xcite in a configuration very similar to our experiments , was predicted to generate finite momentum excitations from the vacuum adding up to the suddenly excited fluid at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this effect , was considered only for the homogeneous 1d polariton at zero temperature , and the model is not ready to be compared at its stage of development with the configuration of our experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> the failures of these analyses point at an unconventional mechanism ruling the high - density , ultrafast dynamics of polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> given that the object appears to be self - sustained , it is important to elucidate its nature , as it may have important applications , especially as the control of ultra - sharp localized light peaks is clearly of technological interest , for instance for high - resolution displays or memory units . </S>",
    "<S> one of the unconventional scenarios that we found to be fairly consistent with most the hypotheses and observations of our experiment involves a sort of collective polaron effect . </S>",
    "<S> the recent work by klembt  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows that the resonant pumping of exciton polaritons into a microcavity may result both in cooling or heating of the crystal lattice depending on the initial lattice temperature and the optical pump power . in our experiments , </S>",
    "<S> realised at a cryogenic temperature and sufficiently high pump power , one should expect such a local heating of the crystal lattice due to the polariton auger process , followed by the emission of a cascade of acoustic phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of this process is quadratic in the polariton density . </S>",
    "<S> the heating results in the local band - gap renormalisation which is responsible for the red - shift of the exciton energy . </S>",
    "<S> the heating by 20 - 30 degrees results in a redshift of the exciton energy of 1 - 2 mev , which is sufficient for trapping the polariton condensate . </S>",
    "<S> in this way , a trap in real space is formed under the pump spot . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes deeper as more polaritons are getting trapped , thus providing a positive feedback that stabilizes the self - trapping process and explain the robustness of the effect . </S>",
    "<S> we have modeled this mechanism through a generalised gross - pitaevskii equation , described in the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> figure  5 shows a result of the numerical simulation for the wavefunction of the polariton condensate ruled by this process . </S>",
    "<S> the upper panel shows the real - space dynamics and next panels the energies of the low and upper polariton branches , respectively . beyond the dynamics of the rabi oscillations , in particular their bending </S>",
    "<S> , the model also reproduces the self - localization in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data .    in conclusions , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed the dynamical appearance of a bright and sharp peak sitting at the center of a series of concentric rings in a polariton fluid generated by the sudden excitation from a resonant laser pulse at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the peak that appears at high pumping is robust to other variations in the experimental parameters ( detuning , momentum , etc . ) , is resolution limited and gathers up to ten times the population initially present in its area . </S>",
    "<S> this striking structure can not be explained by any of the conventional mechanisms such as loss of strong - coupling nor by the common models of polariton dynamics , including gross - pitaevskii type of equations with or without reservoirs and/or attractive interactions . we have provided a possible intepretation in terms of the collective polaron effect , resulting in a self - trapping of the polariton condensate . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that much is left to explore in the high - density and ultrafast dynamics of polaritons , with a striking and unique phenomenology that could open new areas of research and applications .    </S>",
