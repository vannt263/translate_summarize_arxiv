    "in particular , given a dynamic model of the underlying process @xmath308 , this no - arbitrage condition alone does not uniquely specify the call and forward prices , even in a complete market .",
    "see , for instance , the paper of ruf @xcite for a discussion of this issue .",
    "when the market is complete , a candidate call price is the minimal replication cost @xmath311.\\ ] ] another sensible way to price the call is to assume that the put price is its minimal replication cost and the call is priced by put - call parity : @xmath312 \\\\ & = s_0 -{\\mathbb{e } } [ k \\wedge s_t ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , the forward price can be either given by static replication @xmath313 or by dynamic replication @xmath314.\\ ] ]    of course , if @xmath308 is a true martingale the corresponding candidate prices agree ; however , there has been recent interest in models where , for instance , the process @xmath308 is a non - negative strict local martingale , and hence a strict supermartingale .",
    "( such price processes are often described as bubbles ; see , for instance , the paper of cox & hobson @xcite . )    the result of jacquier & keller - ressel quoted here as the second half of theorem [ th : atom ] corresponds to choosing @xmath315 and @xmath316 so that the implied volatility is @xmath317/s_0).\\ ] ] we note here that this convention for defining implied volatility was also adopted in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , note that the convention @xmath318 and @xmath319 is used in equation of the introduction .",
    "we conclude with some remarks on the bounds and asymptotic formulae in this section .",
    "the numerical results suggest that for at least some situations , one of the upper or lower bounds is a better approximation to the implied total standard deviation than the corresponding lowest order asymptotic formula .",
    "one could argue that with more terms in the asymptotic series , better accuracy could be attained with the asymptotics .",
    "although such a claim is indeed plausible , there are a few reasons why it is beside the point .",
    "first , the numerical results presented here should only be considered a proof of concept , rather than a head - to - head competition between state - of - the - art approximations .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting both the given bounds and the asymptotic formulae are only approximations , and therefore have an error term .",
    "but unlike the error terms of an asymptotic formula , the error term for our bounds have a known sign .",
    "second , given one bound , the theorems of section [ se : main ] give a systematic way of finding a better bound .",
    "indeed , fix @xmath28 with @xmath71 , and let @xmath320 .",
    "suppose it known that @xmath321 where @xmath322 is some given approximation .",
    "define @xmath323 by @xmath324 where @xmath325 ^ 2 + 2k } \\ ] ] and @xmath326 is the functions defined by equation of section [ se : main ] . letting @xmath327 we have by theorem [ th : main ] that @xmath328 however , more is true . note that the map @xmath329 has a unique fixed point @xmath330 . since @xmath331",
    "we conclude by the continuity of @xmath329 that @xmath332 for @xmath333 , and more importantly , that @xmath334 for @xmath335 . in particular , @xmath336 that is , @xmath337 is a _ better _ approximation of @xmath330 and the error term has the same sign as the original approximation",
    ". of course , this process can iterated . letting @xmath338 we see that the sequence @xmath339 is decreasing and @xmath340 .",
    "notice that this sequence converges very rapidly . indeed , by taylor s theorem @xmath341 for some @xmath342 .",
    "since @xmath330 minimises @xmath329 we have @xmath343 and hence , by the continuity of @xmath344 , we have @xmath345 as @xmath346 .",
    "furthermore , we can find our initial upper bound @xmath322 by choosing any @xmath347 and letting @xmath348 .",
    "this procedure is illustrated by the cobweb diagram of figure [ fi : cobweb ] .",
    "of course , the convergence can be helped along by an inspired choice of @xmath349 as discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "the above discussion of a rapidly converging sequence should be contrasted with the approach taken , for instance , in the paper of gao & lee @xcite .",
    "there a systematic method of computing terms in the asymptotic series for implied volatility is obtained . however , unlike the procedure discussed above , an asymptotic series may diverge as more terms are added .",
    "a third and final point is that the approximations for the implied total standard deviation are not particularly interesting on their own . indeed , to use the formulae in proposition [ th : gul - bounds ]",
    "one must already know the normalised bond price @xmath263 .",
    "if this quantity is to be calculated numerically from a certain model , one might as well compute the @xmath350 numerically also .",
    "the point of these bounds is to be used in conjunction with other , model dependent bounds on @xmath263 to obtain useful bounds on the quantities of interest .",
