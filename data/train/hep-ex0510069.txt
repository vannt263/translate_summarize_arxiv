    "experiments at lep and sld as well cdf in run i have only provided a lower limit @xmath12 c.l .  @xcite . the high frequency expected for @xmath0  flavor oscillations poses formidable experimental challenges related to the need for extremely accurate proper time resolution in order to resolve the oscillation pattern .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the approximate expression for the significance of the mixing amplitude measurement  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the signal sample size , @xmath15 is the background , @xmath16 is the efficiency for flavor tagging and @xmath17 is the tagging dilution defined as @xmath18 , where the mistag rate @xmath19 is the fraction of b candidates with an incorrectly assigned flavor .",
    "the effect of finite resolution on proper time ( @xmath20 ) reduces the statistical significance of the measurement , especially at high values of @xmath10 . a key point of the cdf",
    "upgrade for run ii has been the capability of triggering on hadronic decays of @xmath15 mesons allowing the collection of fully reconstructed @xmath0  decays . despite the limited statistics available in these modes the excellent proper time resolution significantly helps the current sensitivity of cdf and will offer the unique chance of a determination of @xmath10  from cdf data alone .",
    "we describe here the first search for @xmath0  mixing using 360 @xmath1  of run ii data .",
    "the upgraded cdf detector for run ii  @xcite has been designed to enhance the sensitivity to @xmath0  mixing , in particular with the l00  @xcite layer of silicon detector very close to the beam pipe , the tof system  @xcite and the silicon vertex tracker ( svt )  @xcite .",

    "to ensure optimal vertexing and momentum resolution only tracks reconstructed both in the central drift chamber and in the silicon vertex detector with a minimum transverse momentum of 400 @xmath43   are used .",

    "the systematics are at the level of 1% and demonstrate that the the trigger bias is well under control .",
    "a similar analysis is currently under way using the same semileptonic @xmath0  sample used here .",
    "when completed , it will give the best measurement of @xmath57 lifetime in a flavor specific decay .",
    "for the time being a result consistent with the world average with a statistical uncertainty of 2% has been reported by cdf .",
    "identifying the initial flavor of the @xmath15 mesons at hadron colliders has always been a critical task due to the busy environment of @xmath30 events in @xmath69 collisions . to determine the @xmath0  flavor algorithms",
    "have been developed relying either on the other @xmath30-hadron in the event , opposite side ( os ) taggers , or on the expected charge correlation ( @xmath70 ) between the @xmath0  flavor and the kaons emerging close to the @xmath0  flight direction from the fragmentation and hadronization process , same side kaon ( ssk ) tagger .",
    "five different os taggers are used here :    * a soft muon tagger ( smt ) , based on the detection of muons , with @xmath71 and pseudorapidity @xmath72 from @xmath73 decays .",
    "the dilution is parameterized as a function of a muon likelihood and muon momentum relative to the jet axis , @xmath74 , to account for the higher dilution expected at higher @xmath74 due to lower @xmath75 sequential background . * a similar algorithm , soft electron tagger ( set ) , uses @xmath30 decays to electrons with @xmath76 detected in the central electromagnetic calorimeter . * three different jet charge taggers , where a weighted sum of track charges in opposite side jets is correlated with the initial @xmath30-quark charge sign .",
    "the three algorithms differ on the choice of the tagging jet : jet containing an identified secondary vertex ( jvx ) , jet characterized by at least one displaced track ( jjp ) or the highest @xmath45 jet in the event ( jpt ) .",
    "all the taggers have been tuned on an inclusive and almost pure sample of @xmath77 semileptonic @xmath30 decays from the lepton + svt trigger .",
    "the dilution of each different algorithm is determined , as a function of several variables , from the the trigger lepton charge after correction for mixing and @xmath75 background .",
    "taggers are ranked in order of their expected dilutions and only the decision from the highest dilution tagger available in any single event is used .    since the calibration sample for",
    "the dilution may be different in certain aspects ( e.g. @xmath45 spectra ) from the signal sample a scale factor ( @xmath78 ) is allowed for each of the 5 tagging algorithms .",
    "the @xmath78 factors for the semileptonic and hadronic analysis are fixed by measuring the @xmath4  oscillation frequency and its amplitude using respectively the high statistics @xmath79 and @xmath80 samples .",
    "a summary of the tagging figure of merit @xmath81 is reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : ed2 ] .",
    "the scale factors are consistent with 1 within the precision allowed by the present statistics .",
    "following  @xcite an amplitude scan is performed , where , at each value of the mixing frequency , an amplitude @xmath82 is fitted from the data .",
    "the amplitude @xmath82 should be consistent with 0 for mixing frequencies far from the true value of @xmath10  and with 1 in its vicinity .",
    "this method allows for a straightforward way to combine several measurement ( semileptonic and hadronic ) as well as results from different experiments .",
    "we determined systematic uncertainties on the amplitude @xmath82 using large toy mc experiments to minimize the effect of the limited statistics .",
    "the biggest effects on systematic uncertainties at high value of @xmath10  come from the level and the dilution parameterization of the prompt background for the semileptonic analysis ( contributing @xmath83 ) and the dilution scale factor for the hadronic analysis ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the latter will certainly be reduced with more data since it is limited by the available number of @xmath85 hadronic decays . in any case",
    "the combined systematic uncertainties are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties on the present measurements , for any value of the mixing frequency .",
    "the present cdf sensitivity is dominated by the semileptonic result : @xmath87 c.l . with a sensitivity of 7.4 @xmath3 .",
    "the combined semileptonic and hadronic analysis limit is @xmath2 c.l . while the combined sensitivity increases to 8.4@xmath3 .",
    "combining the cdf mesaurement with previously available results does not change the actual limit and only marginally improves the sensitivity ( from 18.2 to 18.6 ) .",
    "it can be noticed , however , that the current sensitivity of cdfii  data is relatively better behaved at higher @xmath10  than most of previous experiments due to the valuable hadronic sample that will dominate the sensitivity in future higher statistics searches for @xmath0  oscillations .",
