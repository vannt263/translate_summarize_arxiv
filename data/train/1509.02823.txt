    "as explained in the main text , @xmath0-layer mote@xmath3 is modeled as a one - dimensional finite linear chain composed of @xmath91 te atoms of mass per unit area @xmath146 and @xmath0 mo atoms of mass per unit area @xmath147 ( see fig . [ figsi_model ] ) @xcite .",
    "within one mote@xmath3 layer , nearest neighbor mo and te atoms and the pair of second nearest neighbor te atoms are connected by springs with force constants per unit area @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "interlayer interactions are described by two force constants per unit area @xmath94 and @xmath95 between nearest neighbor te atoms belonging to adjacent layers and between second nearest neighbor mo and te atoms , respectively . to account for surface effects ,",
    "we consider effective force constants @xmath135 and @xmath136 for the first and @xmath98 layer .",
    "since substrate effects have been shown to have a negligible influence on the raman modes of mx@xmath3@xcite , we assume that the two extreme layers are only connected to one layer , _",

    "@xmath148 is the displacement , with respect to the equilibrium position , of the @xmath102 atom ( @xmath103 for te and @xmath104 for mo ) in the @xmath105 mote@xmath3 layer ( @xmath106 ) . ]",
    "we note @xmath148 the displacement , with respect to the equilibrium position , of the @xmath102 atom ( @xmath103 for te and @xmath104 for mo ) in the @xmath105 mote@xmath3 layer ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "we can then write the equations of motion using newton s law .",
    "these equations form a system of @xmath149 coupled differential equations that can be written as @xmath150 with the displacement vector @xmath151 and the @xmath110 dynamical matrix    @xmath152 .",
    "+ to find the normal modes , one has to seek for sinusoidal solutions . for this kind of solutions , eq . becomes @xmath153 therefore , the @xmath149 normal modes , with eigenfrequencies @xmath108 and normal displacements @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) , are obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix @xmath111 .",
    "to obtain the frequencies of the six bulk normal modes , we use the same model as in the previous section [ mdlmqt ] except that we apply the born von karman periodic boundary conditions to take into account the infinite size of the crystal . in this case",

    ", we suppose that the equilibrium positions are @xmath157 for the mo atom and @xmath158 and @xmath159 for the two te atoms .",
    "thus , mo atoms belonging to adjacent layers are separated by @xmath160 . with the same notation as in section [ mdlmqt ] , we seek for solutions in the form of a plane wave with frequency @xmath161 and wave vector @xmath162 : @xmath163 where @xmath164 for te and @xmath165 for mo , and @xmath166 are constants to be determined , whose ratio specify the relative amplitude and phase of vibration of the atoms within each layer . by substituting @xmath167 into the equations of motion , we obtain three homogeneous equations in terms of @xmath166 .",

    "in fact , for the six bulk normal modes , the displacements of the three atoms within one layer are either in - phase or out - of - phase with the displacements of the atoms of adjacent layers .",
    "therefore , @xmath171 or @xmath172 respectively . by solving eq . with @xmath171 and @xmath172 and using the symmetry of the atomic displacements , we can get the expression of the six bulk frequencies associated with the low- ( lsm , lbm ) , mid- ( ix and ox ) and high - frequency ( imx , omx ) modes @xcite .",

    "an interesting quantity than can be deduced from the expressions of the bulk frequencies , for low- , mid- and high - frequency modes , is the bulk davydov splitting @xmath177 .",

    "if @xmath182 the splitting is normal and the bulk high - frequency in - phase mode has a lower frequency than the bulk high - frequency out of phase mode . otherwise , the splitting is anomalous , as it has been reported for the imx mode in bulk transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite .",

    "the raman tensor @xmath190 is related to the change of the polarizability @xmath92 under atomic displacement .",

    "+ the bond polarizability model approximates the total polarizability of the atom as the sum of the individual bond polarizabilities . under the assumption that the bonds have cylindrical symmetry ,",

    "that is the reason why we do nt get a finite peak for the @xmath218 ( shear ) mode with this model .",

    "with the bond polarizability model , we can assign a raman intensity to each raman frequency obtained with the force constant model .",
    "while active raman modes agree with group theory and experimental data , the model does not include raman resonance effects , and some discrepancies arise when we compare with experimental spectra .",
    "figure [ raman - theory ] shows the theoretical raman spectra for the modes ix , ox , imx , and omx .",
    "the spectra for different @xmath239 values are offset for clarity .",
    "the ix mode has @xmath240 active subfeatures in @xmath241layer mote@xmath3 and is in nice agreement with the spectra of fig .",
    "3 . + for the imx mode , there are two close peaks for @xmath242 ; one being an inner mode ( with lower frequency ) and the other being a surface mode ( with higher frequency ) .",
    "the difference in their frequencies is around 0.5 @xmath75.the absolute intensity of the inner mode increases almost linearly with number of layers , as there are more layers vibrating , whereas the absolute intensity of the surface mode is independent of number of layers , as only the outer molecules are vibrating . as a result , the relative intensity of the surface mode drops as @xmath0 increases , and thus the maximum of the combined peak shifts to smaller frequencies as @xmath0 increases . + in the case of the ox mode our model reproduces the @xmath243 active subfeatures well , but it fails in describing the observed relative intensity between peaks .",
    "the highest frequency peak in the ox - mode feature has much larger relative intensity than the rest of the peaks in the model , which is in contrast to our measurements , where all the phonons have comparable intensities .",
    "we can understand this result from the shape of the @xmath244 tensors shown above .",
    "the largest contribution occurs when all the te layers are out - of - phase with the neighboring te layers . in case",
    "two layers vibrate in - phase , they cancel each other , and therefore increasing the number of layers in - phase reduces the intensity drastically .",
    "the similar intensity of the @xmath245 peaks suggest the participation of raman resonance effects .",
    "+ for the omx mode , the surface phonons , which are split from the inner modes , have much larger intensity than the inner modes in the model . from the raman tensors , if tellurium atoms in the same layer vibrate in - phase and with identical amplitude , the intensity is identically zero .",
    "only differences in the amplitudes can generate raman signal , which will be very small in comparison with the intensity of the ox modes .",
    "the largest amplitude differences are due to surface phonons , which carry most of the contribution to the raman intensity and it results in the sole peak observed in the raman spectra .",
    "a feature assigned to the inner modes is slightly visible in the measured spectra at @xmath246  ev ( see fig .",
    "3(c ) in the main text ) but not at @xmath247 ev , which , again , suggests a resonance effect at @xmath246 ev , similar to the ox mode .",
    "we have complemented the empirical model with _ ab - initio _ calculations of the phonon modes for bulk mote@xmath3 .",
    "we have used density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt )  @xcite as implemented in the quantum espresso code  @xcite .",
    "we used the local - density approximation ( lda ) which does not properly take into account van der waals interaction between the layers but nevertheless gives decent result for the phonons of many layered systems because it overestimates the weak covalent part of the inter - layer bonding .",
    "the energy cutoff is 80 ry , and the monkhorst - pack sampling of the @xmath248grid is @xmath249 .",
    "the optimized lattice vectors are @xmath250 and @xmath251  .",
    "figure [ bulk - modes - ab ] shows the ab - initio frequencies together with the corresponging phonon eigenvectors .",
    "we have grouped the phonon modes in davydov pairs , except the shear and layer - breathing modes ( whose `` davydov partner '' would be a zero frequency acoustic mode ) .",
    "we observe a positive davydov splitting for the ix , ox and omx modes and a negative davydov splitting for the mode imx mode , as reported for other transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite .",
    "the calculated davydov - splitting of the ix mode is 2.1 @xmath75 ( compared to the 2.7 @xmath75 extrapolated from the measurements ) .",
    "for the ox mode , we obtain a splitting of 3.2 @xmath75 ( compared to 4.7 @xmath75 from the experiments ) .",
    "the agreement between calculations and experiment is not perfect because of the lack of a proper treatment of van der waals interaction with local exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "the predicted davydov - splitting for the omx mode is 5.8 @xmath75 . for the calculation of the frequency of the @xmath38 mode , we have not taken into account the coupling to an external - electric field ( lydanne - sachs - teller interaction ) that would lead to an up - shift of this mode .",

    "<S> , an additional force - constant between mo atoms of neighboring layers would need to be introduced ( which would not modify the splitting between the ox modes @xmath10 and @xmath12 modes because those modes do not involve motion of the mo atoms ) . since the resulting fan - diagram is not visible in our experimental spectra of the omx mode  due to almost vanishing intensity  we did not include this additional force constant here .    finally , we comment on the possible influence of resonance effects on our measurements . </S>",
    "<S> resonance effects should not impact the phonon frequencies but may strongly alter the integrated intensity of one given raman feature and the repartition of the spectral weight within a given subfeature . for the ix mode , </S>",
    "<S> our bond polarizability model predicts spectral weights that are in - line with group theory predictions and our experimental results ( see supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same model predicts that the highest frequency ox mode should have a much larger oscillator strength than its lower frequency counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is clearly in contradiction with our observations at @xmath139 ( see fig  [ fig3]b ) , where the ox - mode subfeatures have comparable integrated intensities , but is consistent with the absence of splittings seen in numerous studies on mos@xmath3 using visible photon energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy , a pronounced splitting of the ox feature was also observed at @xmath140 ( see supporting information ) . </S>",

    "<S> the manifolds of low - frequency interlayer shear and breathing modes , and of the mid - frequency modes involving out - of - phase intralayer motion of the chalcogen atoms are well understood using classical theories of coupled oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the behavior of the high - frequency modes that involve out - of phase motion of the metal and chalcogen planes is largely influenced by surface effects . </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a global fitting procedure based on a linear chain model to derive the force constants up to the second nearest neighbor and to assess the strength of the surface effects . </S>",
