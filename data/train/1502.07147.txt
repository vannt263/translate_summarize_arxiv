    "recent studies in random matrix theory @xcite have drawn renewed attention to the class of eigenvalue probability density functions ( pdfs ) proportional to @xmath4 these pdfs were proposed by muttalib @xcite in the context of a simplified model of the joint distribution of the transmission eigenvalues for disordered conductors in the metallic regime , and with no time reversal symmetry .",
    "the latter is known to have its exact form proportional to @xcite @xmath5 where for large @xmath6 , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 denoting the mean free path length and @xmath10 the length of the wire . in practice",
    "one has @xmath11 .",
    "recalling that @xmath12 one sees ( [ 1.1 ] ) relates to ( [ 1.2 ] ) in the limit @xmath13 when we have @xmath14 although this is still only an approximation to the corresponding factor in ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "actually in @xcite attention was restricted to @xmath3 a positive integer ; on this point we remark that the change of variables @xmath15 maps @xmath3 to @xmath16 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) at the expense of altering @xmath17 .",
    "our interest is two special cases of ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the first is when @xmath18 this is referred to as the laguerre weight , due to its appearance as the weight function in the orthogonality of the laguerre polynomials in the theory of classical orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the choice ( [ l ] ) , together with the choice of @xmath19 as a gaussian or jacobi weight ( for the latter see ( [ j ] ) below ) , was considered in some detail by borodin @xcite . due to",
    "the significant advancement contained in @xcite , we will refer to the general class of pdfs ( [ 1.1 ] ) as muttalib ",
    "borodin ensembles , and the particular choice of weight ( [ l ] ) in ( [ 1.1 ] ) as the laguerre muttalib  borodin ensemble .",
    "let us now describe our results .",
    "in relation to the laguerre muttalib  borodin ensemble , we first realise the special cases @xmath20 as a particular class of complex wishart matrices isolated in @xcite . for general parameters we give a new derivation of a recent result of cheliotis @xcite which gives a realisation in terms of a particular class of random upper - triangular matrices , and",
    "we furthermore develop working in @xcite to generalise this result ( section [ sec : realisations_and_extensions ] ) . the differential equation satisfied by the characteristic polynomial of the ensemble under the mapping ( [ cv ] )",
    "is studied , and we relate this to the resolvent and global density ( section [ sec : characteristic_poly ] ) .",
    "we use results contained in @xcite , and take inspiration from the recent work @xcite , to obtain a derivation of the global density directly from a double contour formula for the one - point function using the saddle point method ( section [ sec : saddle_pt ] ) .",
    "furthermore the double contour integral form of the correlation kernel given in @xcite , suitably generalised from integer to real parameters , is used to rederive the hard edge scaled limit known from @xcite ( section [ sec : hed ] ) .",
    "parallel to the analysis of the laguerre muttalib  borodin ensemble",
    ", we also undertake an analogous program of study in relation to the jacobi weight @xmath21 this substituted in ( [ 1.1 ] ) gives the jacobi muttalib ",
    "borodin ensemble .",
    "our realisation and double contour integral formula for the correlation kernel makes essential use of results contained in @xcite . in relation to the global density ,",
    "the resolvent is specified by a nonlinear equation which we solve using the lagrange inversion formula to deduce that the moments of the global density are given in terms of particular binomial coefficients .",
    "a trigonometric parametrisation of the spectral variable is given which allows for the determination of an explicit functional form for the global density .",
    "the hard edge scaled limit gives the same double contour integral form as found for the laguerre case , in keeping with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we now give a precise statement of the main results in our paper for the laguerre muttalib ",
    "borodin ensemble .",
    "all the results obtained for the laguerre case have counterparts for the jacobi case , described in the paragraph above and which are presented in the body of the paper subsequent to presentation of the laguerre case .",
    "we do not state the results in their most general form below , and readers can find the generalisations in subsequent sections .",
    "first , the laguerre muttalib  borodin ensemble can be realised as the eigenvalues of a random matrix in the _ upper - triangular random matrix ensemble _ , which is defined in section [ subsec : multiple_laguerre_ensemble ] , and if @xmath22 , it can be realised as the eigenvalues of a random matrix in the _ multiple laguerre ensemble _ , which is defined in @xcite and also described in section [ subsec : multiple_laguerre_ensemble ] .",
