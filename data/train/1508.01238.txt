    "continuing with our example and the one - wiggle family @xmath89 described in - , the coefficient is never zero , while setting each of the other coefficients - to be zero results in an affine subset of dimension @xmath95 in the @xmath15-dimensional parameter space for the coefficients  .",
    "thus , all values of the coefficients   except those in the union @xmath96 of five affine subsets of dimension @xmath95 will yield @xmath94 .",

    "our goal will be to consider sufficiently many one - wiggle families @xmath100 so that the intersection @xmath101 of the corresponding unions of affine subsets is empty , which will then imply that @xmath65 holds for all values of coefficients  .",
    "we will achieve this goal for other cases of @xmath2 from theorem [ thm : main ] , but , as we will soon see , we can not quite attain it in the case of @xmath102 .",
    "however , we will show @xmath101 is small and treat remaining cases by other , ad hoc methods .",
    "in this subsection we use the one - wiggle families introduced above to establish theorem [ thm : main ] for @xmath16 .    recall the amitsur - levitzki polynomial @xcite of degree @xmath20 defined as [ eq : al ]",

    "we will describe the proof below and also a mathematica notebook file with more details is available from the arxiv or the authors websites .",
    "the first step of the proof is to find all one - wiggle families ( eliminating those where a constant multiplying a @xmath90 in the image is obviously zero , based on the identity  ) .",
    "computation revealed that there are @xmath111 different one - wiggle families .",
    "the second step is , from each one - wiggle family @xmath89 , to describe the associated union @xmath96 , of affine subsets of @xmath112 .",
    "each affine subspace is given as the solution set of a linear equation , thus , as a row vector of length @xmath113 , whose first four entries are the coefficients of the variables   and whose last entry is the constant term .",
    "though for a given @xmath89 , there are ostensibly six affine subsets whose union is @xmath96 , corresponding to setting the six quantities as in  - to be zero . in practice one of these",

    "thus , each @xmath96 is encoded as a set of five nonzero row vectors of length @xmath113 , and we normalize so that the first nonzero entry is equal to @xmath30 . though there were @xmath111 different one - wiggle families @xmath89 , computation revealed that they yielded only @xmath114 different sets @xmath96 .",
    "the third step is to find one - wiggle families @xmath100 so that @xmath115 this was accomplished , with @xmath116 , as follows . here",
    "is how we keep track of affine subsets of @xmath112 and their unions , and how we compute intersections of the these .",
