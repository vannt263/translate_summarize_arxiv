    "in this paper we study fractal geometric aspects of the limit set @xmath3 of a normal subgroup @xmath0 of some given non - elementary kleinian group @xmath1 acting on @xmath4-dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath5 .",
    "we always assume that @xmath2 contains a coset which is represented by some loxodromic isometry @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that in this situation @xmath3 coincides with the limit set @xmath7 of the larger group @xmath1 .",
    "however , a comparison of finer aspects of these two limit sets usually turns out to be far more involved , as can be seen , for instance , in the work of brooks @xcite and rees @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we investigate the set @xmath8 of directions at some arbitrary point @xmath9 on the manifold @xmath10 associated with @xmath0 for which the resulting geodesic movement on @xmath10 eventually escapes from every compact region on @xmath10 , but which is nevertheless contained in the @xmath11-neighbourhood of some sequence of closed loops starting and ending at @xmath9 on @xmath10 , for each @xmath12 .",
    "that is , we consider the transient limit set @xmath8 of @xmath0 , given by @xmath13 here , @xmath14 refers to the hyperbolic metric in @xmath5 and @xmath15 denotes a @xmath16-parametrisation of the geodesic ray from the origin to @xmath17 .",
    "+ the following theorem gives the main result of this paper .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath0 be given as above .",
    "we then have @xmath18    this theorem gives a extension of results by fernndez and melin @xcite , who studied the set @xmath19 of escaping , not necessarily loop - approximable directions on a complete oriented non - compact riemann surface @xmath20 with fundamental group @xmath21 .",
    "that is , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 refers to the boundary at infinity of @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes the hyperbolic metric in @xmath24 .",
    "the main result of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) was to establish the following tricothomy .    *",
    "if @xmath20 has finite area , then @xmath19 is countable . * if brownian motion on @xmath20 is transient , then @xmath19 has full lebesgue measure . *",
    "if @xmath20 has infinite area and brownian motion is recurrent , then @xmath19 has zero lebesgue measure , but its hausdorff dimension is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , for hyperbolic manifolds which are normal coverings of some hyperbolic manifold and which posess a loxodromic representative @xmath27 , our main theorem extends the results by fernndez and melin to arbitrary dimensions and to the situation where the boundary at infinity of hyperbolic space is replaced by the limit set of the fundamental group .",
    "however , let us emphasize that our proof does require the existence of a loxodromic @xmath27 , and hence our extension is restricted to normal coverings with this property .",
    "our proof hinges on two renormalisation procedures .",
    "these are used to locate a certain family of subsystems within the loop - approximable , non - recurrent dynamics on the manifold @xmath28 . at the boundary of the universal covering space these subsystems",
    "are described by a family of cantor sets contained in @xmath3 , and here the key observation is that this family contains cantor sets whose hausdorff dimension is arbitrarily close to the hausdorff dimension of @xmath7 .",
    "these cantor sets are constructed inductively using the following two renormalisation procedures .",
    "the first of these employs a well - known construction by bishop and jones for computing the hausdorff dimension of bounded dynamics ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this construction gives rise to a certain weighted scaling law , which we then apply a sufficient number of times in order to prepare for the second renormalisation step . on the manifold @xmath28",
    "this first step of the overall construction corresponds to a family of well separated quasi - geodesics within a bounded region of @xmath28 , each starting at the same point .",
    "the second renormalisation procedure consists in prolonging each of these quasi - geodesics by a long geodesic segment which is contained in the projection of the axis @xmath29 of @xmath30 onto @xmath28 , and which is chosen such that it leads out of the bounded region which contained the original quasi - geodesics .",
    "the resulting dynamical behaviour on @xmath28 is sketched in figure  [ mnf ] .",

    ", the reader might like to recall that the radial limit set @xmath32 represents those limit points @xmath17 for which the projection of a hyperbolic ray towards @xmath17 returns infinitely often to some compact part of the manifold associated to @xmath1 .",

    "let us first show that @xmath136 lies always close to the summit @xmath137 of the geodesic @xmath138 , the image of the axis @xmath139 under @xmath140 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath141 , the statement in ( 1 ) of [ rrp ] implies that there exists @xmath142 such that @xmath143 ( see also figure  [ etaplus ] ) .",
    "the elementary observation in ( [ axis ] ) shows that the distance from the summit of a geodesic to each of the two rays from the origin to the endpoints of the geodesic is less than @xmath70 .",
    "thus , by construction , we have that @xmath144    recall that in the recurrent renormalisation procedure [ rrp ] we have already derived the existence of the parameter @xmath145 , which is the upper bound of the lengths of the edges in the tree @xmath146 .",
    "next , consider the geodesic @xmath147 containing the points @xmath148 and @xmath109 ; one of its endpoints will be @xmath149 .",
    "assume , by way of contradiction , that the distance between @xmath109 and the summit @xmath137 of @xmath147 is larger than @xmath150 .",
    "projecting onto the manifold @xmath28 associated to @xmath0 and using the hyperbolic triangle inequality , we obtain a contradiction to the fact that @xmath151 .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath152 where the comparability constant depends only on the distance @xmath150 , and therefore , only on @xmath0 and @xmath153 .",
    "the statement now follows by applying @xmath154 to the ball @xmath155 , which immediately gives that @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "let us remark that the constant @xmath158 in [ rrp ] and the constant @xmath70 in [ trp ] are independent of each other . also , the statements in [ rrp ] continue to hold if we replace @xmath158 by a smaller positive number , and the same holds for @xmath70 in [ trp ] .",
    "therefore , for the remainder of this paper , when applying [ rrp ] and [ trp ] , we use @xmath159 instead of @xmath158 and @xmath70 .",
    "let us first observe that it is sufficient to prove the assertion in the theorem for the case in which @xmath160 indeed , this can immediately be seen by way of contradiction as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath161 .",
    "since diminishing a set by a subset of smaller hausdorff dimension does not alter the hausdorff dimension of that set and using the well known fact that @xmath162 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath163 therefore , we can now assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath164 the rough strategy for proving the main theorem in this case is as follows . for some arbitrary given @xmath165 , we construct a certain cantor set @xmath166 , and then show that @xmath167 . by the arbitrary choice of @xmath153 , the theorem then follows .",
    "the idea of the cantor set construction is to start at the origin and then to perform an alternating inductive process using both renormalisation procedures .",
    "the building block of this process is that we first apply the recurrent renormalisation procedure [ rrp ] sufficiently many times until the resulting power of @xmath168 is large enough ( in fact , this number of times depends on the outcome of the step to come ) .",
    "after that , we perform the transient renormalisation procedure [ trp ] sufficiently many times , without loosing the control on the distortion ( in particular , this step will guarantee that out cantor set contains only transient limit points ) .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath169 be given .",
    "then @xmath153 determines the width @xmath145 of the recurrent renormalisation procedure [ rrp ] . having fixed @xmath145",
    ", we choose @xmath170 , the number of times we are going to apply the transient renormalisation procedure [ trp ] , so that @xmath171 this choice of @xmath135 will guarantee that the cantor set @xmath172 we are going to construct will be contained in @xmath173 .",
    "finally , we choose @xmath174 to be minimal with respect to the property @xmath175 let us now come to the explicit construction of @xmath172 .",
    "as already mentioned , the construction starts at the origin , and we set @xmath176 .",
    "then , the first step is to apply the recurrent renormalisation procedure [ rrp ] @xmath177 times , starting at @xmath178 . according to [ rrp ] , this gives rise to a set of hyperbolic balls @xmath179 whose radial projections to the boundary @xmath51 are pairwise disjoint and of comparable diameter .",
    "the set of centres of these balls in @xmath5 will be denoted by @xmath180 .",
    "then , the second step is to apply the transient renormalisation procedure [ trp ] @xmath135 times to each element in @xmath180 .",
    "the set of centres of the so obtained hyperbolic balls will be denoted by @xmath181 .",
    "this represents the start of the induction , and we then continue as follows .",
    "assume that the sets @xmath182 and @xmath183 have been constructed , for some @xmath76 .",
    "to each of the points in @xmath183 we then apply the recurrent renormalisation procedure [ rrp ] @xmath177 times .",
    "the set of centres of these so obtained hyperbolic balls gives the set @xmath184 .",
    "next , we apply the transient renormalisation procedure [ trp ] @xmath135 times to each of the elements in @xmath184 .",
    "the set of centres of these so obtained hyperbolic balls gives rise to the set @xmath185 .",
    "this finishes our alternating inductive argument ( see also figure  [ induct ] ) , and we can now use it to define our desired cantor set @xmath172 by @xmath186 here , @xmath187 refers to the constant which we specified at the end of section [ 3 ] . + next ,",
    "observe that in this cantor set construction we have good control over the distortion , when going from one generation in the construction to the next .",
    "that is , by using [ rrp ] @xmath188 , [ trp ] and the condition in ( [ constants ] ) , we have the following crucial estimate , for each @xmath76 , @xmath189 using a straightforward generalisation of the folklore arguments from fractal geometry of ( * ? ? ?",

    "* corollary 2.6 ) , the latter estimate immediately gives that @xmath190 it remains to show that the set @xmath172 is contained in @xmath8 .",
    "for this , note that , by viewing the construction of @xmath172 from within @xmath5 , the set @xmath172 gives rise to a geodesic @xmath1-tree which is rooted at the origin and whose vertex set is equal to @xmath191 . by construction",
    ", this tree has the property that the lengths of the constituting geodesic edges and the angles formed by adjacent edges are uniformly bounded away from zero .",
    "therefore , each path in this tree starting at the origin is a quasi - geodesic heading towards a uniquely determined point at infinity .",
    "clearly , the projection of each of these quasi - geodesics onto the manifold @xmath10 gives some piecewise geodesic movement in @xmath10 which has the following properties .",
    "if an edge in the tree starts at a vertex in @xmath192 and ends at a point in @xmath182 , then in @xmath10 this edge is represented by a geodesic loop of hyperbolic length at most @xmath193 .",
    "obviously , this loop must then be contained in a bounded region of @xmath10 of diameter at most @xmath193 .",
    "whereas , if an edge in the tree starts at a vertex in @xmath182 and ends at a point in @xmath183 , using [ trp ] , we then have that in @xmath10 this edge represents a geodesic segment in @xmath10 which starts in the previous bounded region and then heads straight towards the end of @xmath10 associated with the attractive fixed point @xmath38 of @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the condition in ( [ transient ] ) guarantees that the hyperbolic length of that segment is at least equal to @xmath194 , and this shows that it s end point is separated by at least @xmath195 from the previous bounded region .",
