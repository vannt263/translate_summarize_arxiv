    "there are many basic problems in differential geometry that are completely solved for riemannian manifolds , but that become really complicated in the pseudo - riemannian situation",
    ". one of these problems is the determination of all possible holonomy groups of pseudo - riemannian manifolds .",
    "while holonomy groups of riemannian manifolds are classified the problem is open for general pseudo - riemannian manifolds , only the lorentzian case is solved .",
    "the difficulty is that in general the holonomy representation of a pseudo - riemannian manifold does not decompose into irreducible summands . of course",
    ", we can decompose the representation into indecomposable ones , i.e. , into subrepresentations that do not have proper non - degenerate invariant subspaces .",
    "by de rham s theorem the indecomposable summands are again holonomy representations .",
    "this reduces the problem to the classification of indecomposable holonomy representations .",
    "indecomposable holonomy represesentations that are not irreducible have isotropic invariant subspaces .",
    "such representation are especially difficult to handle if these invariant subspaces do not have an invariant complement .",
    "manifolds that have an indecomposable holonomy representation are called indecomposable .",
    "manifolds that are not indecomposable are at least locally a product of pseudo - riemannian manifolds .",
    "hence , we can speak of local factors of such a manifold .",
    "many open questions in pseudo - riemannian differential geometry are directly related to the unsolved holonomy problem .",
    "one of these open questions is the classification problem for symmetric spaces .",
    "pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces are in some sense the most simple pseudo - riemannian manifolds .",
    "locally they are characterised by parallelity of the curvature tensor . as global manifolds",
    "they are defined as follows .",
    "a connected pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath0 is called a pseudo - riemannian symmetric space if for any @xmath1 there is an involutive isometry @xmath2 of @xmath0 that has @xmath3 as an isolated fixed point . in other words , for any @xmath1 the geodesic reflection at @xmath3 extends to a globally defined isometry of @xmath0 .",
    "the theory of riemannian symmetric spaces was developed simultaneously with the theory of semisimple lie groups and algebras by e. cartan during the first decades of the twentieth century .",
    "it results in a complete classification of these spaces , see helgason s beautiful book @xcite on the subject .",
    "the theory remains similar in spirit as long as one is interested in pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces whose holonomy representation is completely reducible as an algebraic representation , i.e. , if any invariant subspace of the holonomy representation has an invariant complement .",
    "these so called reductive symmetric spaces were classified by berger @xcite in 1957 .",
    "this classification is essentially the classification of involutions on real semisimple lie algebras .    in order to understand non - reductive pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces",
    "one has to consider more general lie algebras , which are , moreover , equipped with an invariant inner product .",
    "note that in contrast to the semisimple case this inner product is really an additional datum since it is not just a multiple of the killing form .",
    "such a pair @xmath4 consisting of a finite - dimensional real lie algebra and an @xmath5-invariant non - degenerate symmetric bilinear form on it is called a _",
    "metric lie algebra_. in the literature metric lie algebras appear under various different names , e.g.  as quadratic or orthogonal lie algebras .",
    "the transition from symmetric spaces to metric lie algebras proceeds as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be a pseudo - riemannian symmetric space .",
    "the group @xmath7 generated by compositions of geodesic reflections @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is called the transvection group of @xmath6 .",
    "it acts transitively on @xmath0 .",
    "we fix a base point @xmath10 . the reflection @xmath11 induces an involutive automorphism @xmath12 of the lie algebra @xmath13 of @xmath7 , and thus a decomposition @xmath14 .",
    "the natural identification @xmath15 induces an @xmath16-invariant bilinear form @xmath17 on @xmath18 .",
    "it is an important observation ( see @xcite ) that @xmath17 extends uniquely to an @xmath19- and @xmath12-invariant inner product @xmath20 on @xmath13 .",
    "thus , starting with a pseudo - riemannian symmetric space @xmath6 , we obtain a metric lie algebra @xmath4 together with an isometric involution @xmath12 on it . the resulting triple @xmath21",
    "will be called a _",
    "symmetric triple _",
    "later on . up to local isometry",
    ", @xmath6 can be recovered from this structure .",
    "we will call a symmetric space as well as its associated symmetric triple semisimple ( reductive , solvable etc . ) if its transvection group is semisimple ( reductive , solvable etc . ) .",
    "the reader will find more details on the correspondence between symmetric spaces and symmetric triples in section [ s31 ] .",
    "for the general theory of symmetric spaces he may consult @xcite .",
    "the moral we want to stress at this point is that the understanding of metric lie algebras is crucial for the understanding of symmetric spaces .",
    "the present paper focuses on the classification problem for pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces .",
    "the above discussion reduces this problem to the classification of symmetric triples .",
    "it is easy to see that we can decompose every symmetric triple into a direct sum of a semisimple one and one whose underlying lie algebra does not have simple ideals .",
    "of course , pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces that are associated with semisimple symmetric triples are reductive , and thus , as explained above , already classified .",
    "this is the reason for our decision to concentrate here on metric lie algebras and symmetric triples without simple ideals .",
    "thus the investigation of the geometry of semisimple symmetric spaces , which is still an active and interesting field , will be left almost untouched in this paper .",
    "the classification of metric lie algebras appears to be very difficult .",
    "most likely , one has to accept that one wo nt get a classification in the sense of a list that includes all metric lie algebras for arbitrary index of the inner product .",
    "the same is true for symmetric triples , the existence of an involution neither decreases nor really increases the difficulties .",
    "therefore the aim is to develop a structure theory for metric lie algebras ( and symmetric triples ) that allows a systematic construction and that gives a `` recipe '' how to get an explicit classification under suitable addiditional conditions , e.g. , for small index of the inner product . in @xcite",
    "we developed a new strategy to reach this aim .",
    "the initial idea of this strategy is due to brard - bergery who observed that every symmetric triple without simple ideals arises in a canonical way by an extension procedure from `` simpler '' lie algebras with involution .",
    "we used this idea to give a cohomological description of isomorphism classes of metric lie algebras ( and symmetric triples ) , which gives a suitable classification scheme . here",
    "we will present this method , called quadratic extension , and some of its applications .",
    "moreover , we will survey earlier and related results due to cahen , parker , medina , revoy , bordemann , alekseevsky , corts , and others concerning metric lie algebras and symmetric triples from this new point of view .",
    "we do not aim at a complete overwiew on the work on metric lie algebras and symmetric spaces , for instance the basic results of astrahancev ( see e.g. @xcite ) will not be discussed .",
    "however , we try to present a quite complete up - to - date account for classification results for metric lie algebras ( section  [ s25 ] ) , symmetric spaces ( section  [ s33 ] ) , and symmetric spaces with certain complex or quaternionic structures ( sections  [ s42 ] and [ s43 ] ) .    note that metric lie algebras are of interest in their own right , not only in the context of symmetric spaces .",
    "they naturally appear in various contexts , e.g. , in mathematical physics or in poisson geometry . as an illustration",
    ", we shortly discuss the notions of manin triples and pairs and present a new construction method for manin pairs based on the theory of quadratic extensions of metric lie algebras ( section  [ s52 ] ) . as a further application we study pseudo - riemannian extrinsic symmetric spaces by our method ( section  [ s51 ] ) .    though being a survey article the paper also contains some new results .",
    "a first group of new results appears in section [ s2 ] and is due to the fact that we develop here a unified theory which works for metric lie algebras , symmetric triples , and symmetric triples with additional structures at once .",
    "most of these results are straightforward generalisations of the corresponding special results given in the original papers @xcite .",
    "proofs that really require new ideas will be given in the appendix .",
    "this generality makes sections  [ s22 ] and [ s23 ] a little bit more technical than usual for survey articles .",
    "however , having mastered these moderate technical difficulties the reader will see in the subsequent sections how quite different results follow easily from one general principle . the results in section  [ s32 ] concerning the geometric meaning of the quadratic extension procedure and",
    "the above mentioned construction method for manin pairs appear here for the first time .",
    "in addition , we announce a new result on the structure of hyper - khler symmetric spaces ( theorem  [ grob ] ) .",
    "the theory of metric lie algebras and pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces is far from being complete .",
    "in fact , there is a huge amount of open problems .",
    "the difficulty is to find those questions , which really lead to new theoretical insight and not just to messy calculations .",
    "we hope that the questions raised at several places in this paper belong to the fist category .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the set of positive integers and we put @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a pseudo - euclidean vector space .",
    "a subspace @xmath25 is called isotropic if @xmath26 . a basis @xmath27 of @xmath28",
    "is called orthonormal if @xmath29 for @xmath30 , @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 . in this case",
    "@xmath35 is called signature and @xmath36 index of @xmath37 ( or of @xmath28 ) .",
    "let @xmath38 be the inner product of signature @xmath35 on @xmath39 for which the standard basis of @xmath39 is an orthonormal basis .",
    "then we call @xmath40 standard pseudo - euclidean space",
    ".    we will often describe a lie algebra by giving a basis and some of the lie bracket relations , e.g. we will write the three - dimensional heisenberg algebra as @xmath41=z\\}$ ] . in this case",
    "we always assume that all other brackets of basis vectors vanish .",
    "if we do not mention the basis explicitly , then we suppose that all basis vectors appear in one of the bracket relations ( on the left or the right hand side ) .",
    "let @xmath42 be a lie algebra and let @xmath28 be an @xmath42-module . then @xmath43 denotes the space of invariants in @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "the easiest example of a metric lie algebra is an abelian lie algebra together with an arbitrary ( non - degenerate ) inner product .",
    "a further well - known example is a semisimple lie algebra equipped with a non - zero multiple of its killing form .",
    "let @xmath45 be a lie group and @xmath46 its lie algebra .",
    "the cotangent bundle @xmath47 can be given a group structure such that the associated lie algebra equals @xmath48 .",
    "now let @xmath49 be any invariant symmetric bilinear form on @xmath46 ( which can degenerate ) .",
    "we can define on @xmath48 a symmetric bilinear form @xmath20 by adding @xmath50 to the dual pairing of @xmath46 and @xmath51 , that is by @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "it is not hard to prove that @xmath20 is invariant and non - degenerate , its signature equals @xmath55 .",
    "hence @xmath56 is a metric lie algebra . in particular",
    ", @xmath20 induces a biinvariant metric on @xmath47 .",
    "the following construction is a generalisation of the previous example .",
    "it is due to medina and revoy @xcite . starting with an @xmath57-dimensional metric lie algebra and an arbitrary @xmath58-dimensional lie algebra it produces a metric lie algebra of dimension @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be a metric lie algebra and let @xmath61 be a lie algebra with an invariant symmetric bilinear form ( which can degenerate ) .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath62 be a lie algebra homomorphism from @xmath46 into the lie algebra of all antisymmetric derivations of @xmath13 .",

    "then @xmath72 is a metric lie algebra .",
    "it is called double extension of @xmath13 by @xmath46 since it can be regarded as an extension of the semi - direct product @xmath73 by the abelian lie algebra @xmath51 .",
    "if the signature of @xmath13 equals @xmath35 and if @xmath74 , then the signature of @xmath75 equals @xmath76 .    the importance of this construction becomes clear from the following structure theorem by medina and revoy .",
    "it says that we can inductively produce all metric lie algebras from simple and one - dimensional ones by taking direct sums and applying the double extension procedure .",
    "[ tmr ] if @xmath4 is an indecomposable metric lie algebra , then either @xmath13 is simple or @xmath13 is one - dimensional or @xmath13 is a double extension @xmath77 of a metric lie algebra @xmath78 by a one - dimensional or a simple lie algebra @xmath46 .",
    "we remark that for the special case of solvable metric lie algebras this result can already be found in the form of exercises in kac s book @xcite , exercises 2.10,11 . for a complete proof in this case see also @xcite .",
    "using theorem  [ tmr ] it is not hard to see that any indecomposable non - simple lorentzian metric lie algebra is the double extension of an abelian euclidean metric lie algebra by a one - dimensional lie algebra .",
    "this allows the classification of isomorphism classes of lorentzian metric lie algebras @xcite , compare example  [ osc ] and theorem  [ lorentz ] .    in principle one can try and use this method to classify also metric lie algebras of higher index",
    "this was done in @xcite for index two . however , now the following difficulty arises . in general a metric lie algebra of index greater than one",
    "can be obtained in many different ways by double extension from a lower - dimensional one .",
    "thus in order to solve the classification problem we would have to decide under which conditions two metric lie algebras arising in different ways by repeated application of the double extension construction ( and direct sums ) are isomorphic .",
    "this seems to be very complicated .",
    "therefore we are now looking for a way that avoids this difficulty .",
    "in the following we will develop a structure theory for metric lie algebras which is more adapted to classification problems .",
    "the basic idea of this theory goes back to brard - bergery @xcite who suggested to consider indecomposable non - semisimple pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces as the result of two subsequent extensions .",
    "our starting point is the following construction .",
    "let @xmath42 be a lie algebra and let @xmath79 be an orthogonal representation of @xmath42 on a pseudo - euclidean vector space @xmath24 .",
    "take @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
