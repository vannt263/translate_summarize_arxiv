    "+ more promising candidates for neutrinoless double - electron capture are systems with ground - state to ground - state transitions ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "their major advantage is a larger nuclear matrix element @xmath16 and a larger phase space compared to the ground - state to excited - state transitions .",
    "the maximum capture rate is expected if the resonant enhancement criterion is fulfilled for the capture of two k - shell electrons in heavy nuclides .",
    "two candidates for such types of transitions , proposed in @xcite , have recently been explored with the penning trap system shiptrap : @xmath17gd@xmath18sm @xcite and @xmath19er@xmath20dy @xcite .",

    "due to the extremely small mass difference of the two species and the identical ion production as well as preparation mechanisms systematic uncertainties can be neglected on the present level of statistical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "note that no absolute mass values are deduced from the present measurements , but only the mass difference between the two close - lying ion species . for the analysis only those events with an ion number of less or equal to 5 ions per cycle were considered in order to exclude frequency shifts due to ion - ion interactions @xcite .",
