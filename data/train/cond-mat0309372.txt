    "superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 discovered a few years ago@xcite has attracted a lot of interest both from fundamental and technological points of view.@xcite unique physical properties of mgb@xmath0 include @xmath3  k , the highest among @xmath4-wave phonon mediated superconductors , and the presence of two gaps @xmath5  mev and @xmath6  mev evidenced by the scanning tunneling@xcite and the point contact@xcite spectroscopies and by the heat capacity measurements.@xcite the latter property brings back the concept of a multi - gap superconductivity@xcite formulated more than forty years ago for materials with large disparity of the electron - phonon interaction for different pieces of the fermi surface .",
    "theoretical understanding of normal and superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 has been advanced in the direction of first - principle calculations of the electronic band structure and the electron - phonon interaction , which identified two distinct groups of bands with large and small superconducting gaps.@xcite quantitative analysis of various thermodynamic and transport properties in the superconducting state of mgb@xmath0 was made in the framework of the two - band bcs model .",
    "@xcite an outside observer would notice , however , a certain lack of effective ginzburg - landau or london type theories applied to mgb@xmath0 .",
    "this fact is explained of by quantitative essence of the discussed problems , though effective theories can often give a simpler insight . besides , new experiments constantly raise different types of questions .",
    "for example , recent neutron diffraction study in the mixed state of mgb@xmath0 has found a strange @xmath2-reorientation of the vortex lattice with increasing strength of a magnetic field applied along the @xmath1-axis.@xcite such a transition represents a marked qualitative departure from the well - known behavior of the abrikosov vortex lattice in single - gap type - ii superconductors .",
    "nature and origin of phase transitions in the vortex lattice are most straightforwardly addressed by the ginzburg - landau theory .    in the present work",
    "we first derive the appropriate ginzburg - landau functional for a two - gap superconductor from the microscopic bcs model .",
    "we , then , investigate various magnetic properties of mgb@xmath0 using the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "our main results include demonstration of the upward curvature of @xmath7 for transverse magnetic fields , investigation of the vortex core structure , and explanation of the reorientational transition in the vortex lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the two - band bcs model and discusses the fit of experimental data on the temperature dependence of the specific heat .",
    "section 3 is devoted to derivation of the ginzburg - landau functional for a two - gap weak - coupling superconductor . in section  4",
    "we discuss various magnetic properties including the upper critical field and the structure of an isolated vortex .",
    "section 5 considers the general problem of an orientation of the vortex lattice in a hexagonal superconductor in magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath1-axis and , then , demonstrates how the multi - gap nature of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 determines a reorientational transition in the mixed state .",
    "in this subsection we briefly summarize the thermodynamics of an @xmath4-wave two - gap superconductor with the aim to extract subsequently microscopic parameters of the model from available experimental data for mgb@xmath0 .",

    "the transition temperature is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the debay frequency , @xmath28 is the euler constant and @xmath29 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath30 : @xmath31 since @xmath32 , the interband scattering always increases the superconducting transition temperature compared to an instability in a single - band case .",
    "the ratio of the two gaps at @xmath33 is @xmath34 . at zero temperature",

    "ab - initio calculations indicate that mgb@xmath0 has an intermediate strength of the electron - phonon coupling with @xmath49 , making this superconductor an ideal system to observe effects related to variations of the ratio of two gaps .",
    "the jump in the specific heat at the superconducting transition can be expressed analytically as@xcite @xmath50 where the limit @xmath51 has to be taken for the ratio of the two gaps .",

    "we have calculated various fermi surface averages for each band .",

    "both theoretical curves reproduce quite well the qualitative behavior of @xmath55 .",
    "somewhat better fits can be obtained by increasing the partial density of states in the @xmath60-band .",
    "quantitative discrepancies between various theoretical fits and the experimental data are , however , less significant than differences between different samples .",
    "@xcite we , therefore , conclude that though the specific heat data clearly agree with the two - gap superconducting model in the regime of weak interband interaction , a unique identification of coupling constants is not possible from available data .",
    "we use the microscopic theory formulated in the previous section to derive the ginzburg - landau functional of a two - gap superconductor . in the vicinity of @xmath81 the anomalous terms in the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ mf ] )",

    "the interaction term favors the same phase for the two gaps . for @xmath89 , if , _",
    "e.g. _ , the coulomb interactions dominate the interband scattering of the cooper pairs and @xmath90 , the smaller gap acquires a @xmath62-shift relative to the larger gap.@xcite    the gradient term coefficients depend in a standard way on the averages of fermi velocities @xmath91 over various sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "numerical integration of the tight - binding fits@xcite yields the following results : for the @xmath60-band @xmath92 ( 3.55 , 1.51 ) and @xmath93 ( 0.05 , 0.05 ) ; for the @xmath62-band @xmath94 ( 1.47 , 1.55 ) and @xmath95 ( 2.81 , 3.10 ) in units of @xmath96  @xmath97/s@xmath98 , numbers in parentheses correspond to each of the constituent bands .",
    "the effective masses of the quasi two - dimensional @xmath60-band exhibit a factor of 40 anisotropy between in - plane and out of plane directions .",

    "we find that the in - plane gradient constants for the two bands are practically the same @xmath99 , while the @xmath1-axis constants differ by almost two orders of magnitude @xmath100",
    ".    a very simple form of the two - gap weak - coupling ginzburg - landau functional is somewhat unexpected . on general symmetry grounds ,",
    "there are possible various types of interaction in quartic and gradient terms between two superconducting condensates of the same symmetry , which have been considered in the literature.@xcite the above form of the ginzburg - landau functional is , nevertheless , a straightforward extension of the well - known result for unconventional superconductors .",
    "for example , the quartic term for a momentum - dependent gap is @xmath101 in the weak - coupling approximation.@xcite in the two - band model @xmath102 assumes a step - like dependence between different pieces of the fermi surface , which immediately leads to the expression ( [ gl ] ) .",
    "the ginzburg - landau equations for the two - gap superconductor , which are identical to those obtained from eq .",
    "( [ gl ] ) , have been first derived by an expansion of the gap equations in powers of @xmath103.@xcite recently , a similar calculation has been done for a dirty superconductor , with only _ intraband _ impurity scattering and the corresponding form of the ginzburg - landau functional has been guessed , though with incorrect sign of the coupling term.@xcite here , we have directly derived the free energy of the two - gap superconductor .",
    "the derivation can be straightforwardly generalized to obtain , e.g. higher - order gradient terms , which are needed to find an orientation of the vortex lattice relative to crystal axis ( see below ) .",
    "we also note that strong - coupling effects , e.g. , dependence of the pairing interactions on the gap amplitudes , will produce other , generally weaker , mixing terms of the fourth order in @xmath103 .",
    "the _ interband _ scattering by impurities can generate a mixing gradient term as well .",
    "finally , for @xmath104 a number of spurious features appears in the theory : the matrix @xmath30 and the quadratic form ( [ const ] ) acquire negative eigenvalues , while a formal minimization of the ginzburg - landau functional ( [ gl ] ) leads to an unphysical solution at high temperatures .",
    "sign of @xmath39 for such a solution is opposite to the sign of @xmath47 .",
    "the origin of this ill - behavior lies in the approximation of positive integrals on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gapeq2 ] ) by logarithms , which can become negative .",
    "therefore , negative eigenvalues of @xmath30 and @xmath105 yield no physical solution similar to the case when the bcs theory is applied to the fermi gas with repulsion .",
    "the consequence for the ginzburg - landau theory ( [ gl ] ) is that one should keep the correct sign of @xmath39 and use the ginzburg - landau equations , _",
    "i.e. _ , look for a saddle - point solution rather than seeking for an absolute minimum .",
    "in order to discuss various properties of a two - gap superconductor in the framework of the ginzburg - landau theory we write @xmath106 with @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the first active band and @xmath110 with @xmath111 , @xmath112 for the passive band .      for completeness , we briefly mention here the behavior in zero magnetic field .",
    "the transition temperature is found from diagonalization of the quadratic form in eq .",
    "( [ gl ] ) : @xmath113 for small @xmath114 , one finds @xmath115 .",

    "can be described by two constants @xmath125 .",
    "the linearized ginzburg - landau equations describe a system of two coupled oscillators and have a solution in the form @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a state on the zeroth landau level .",

    "a multi - gap superconductor has several different ratios @xmath147 and the above rescaling procedure does not work . in other words ,",
    "coupled harmonic oscillators described by the linearized ginzburg - landau equations have different resonance frequencies . to solve this problem",
    "we follow a variational approach , which is known to give a good accuracy in similar cases .",
    "the vector potential is chosen in the landau gauge @xmath148 and we look for a solution in the form @xmath149 where @xmath29 , @xmath1 , and @xmath150 are variational parameters . after spatial integration and substitution @xmath151 , @xmath152 ,",
    "the quadratic terms in the ginzburg - landau functional become @xmath153 the determinant of the quadratic form vanishes at the transition into superconducting state .",
    "transition field is given by the same expression as in the isotropic case ( [ hc2_iso ] ) , where @xmath143 have to be replaced with @xmath154 .",
    "the upper critical field is , then , obtained from maximizing the corresponding expression with respect to the variational parameter @xmath155 .",
    "in general , maximization procedure has to be done numerically .",
    "analytic expressions are possible in two temperature regimes . at low temperatures @xmath156 , the upper critical field",
    "is entirely determined by the active band and @xmath157 in the vicinity of @xmath81 , an external magnetic field has a small effect on the gap ratio @xmath158 and an effective single - gap ginzburg - landau theory can be applied .",
    "the upper critical field is given by a combination of the gradient constants @xmath159 weighted according to the gap amplitudes : @xmath160 since , in mgb@xmath0 one has @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the slope of the upper critical field near @xmath81 is determined by an effective gradient constant @xmath163 ( while @xmath164 ) .",
    "thus , the upper critical field line @xmath7 shows a marked upturn curvature between the two regimes ( [ hc2high ] ) and ( [ hc2low ] ) .",
    "such a temperature behavior has been recently addressed in a number of theoretical works based on various forms of the two - band bcs theory.@xcite we suggest here a simpler description of the above effect within the two - gap ginzburg - landau theory .",
