    "direct photons are a unique probe of the early stage of a heavy - ion collision , as they leave the interaction region without being influenced by strong interactions or hadronization processes .",
    "they are therefore regarded as an important tool in the search for the quark - gluon plasma in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . as direct photons from different sources ,",
    "e.g. prompt and thermal direct photons , can not be separated experimentally , further information is needed to quantify the different contributions .",
    "the wa98 collaboration was the first to publish a significant direct - photon excess in heavy - ion collisions at @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the excess could be understood by theoretical descriptions with and without a thermal direct photon contribution  @xcite . to pin down a thermal component ,",
    "the pb+pb data were compared to p+p and p+a data at @xmath4  @xcite . due to large systematic uncertainties introduced by the necessary @xmath5-scaling and a limited @xmath6 coverage in the region where a thermal contribution would be most prominent ,",
    "no limits on the prompt photon contribution could be derived  @xcite .",
    "pqcd calculations have large uncertainties at @xmath7  @xcite , therefore no definite conclusions on a thermal contribution could be drawn based on the available information  @xcite . here",
    ", we will present results on direct photon production in p+pb and p+c collisions measured at @xmath2 with the wa98 experiment in 1996 .",
    "these results will be compared to the pb+pb data .",
    "in the wa98 experiment photons were measured using a highly segmented lead glass calorimeter , positioned 21.5 m downstream of the target and covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath8 .",
    "the minimum bias trigger was determined by measuring the transverse energy ( @xmath9 ) with a hadronic calorimeter in the range @xmath10 .",
    "the measured minimum bias cross section @xmath11 for p+c ( p+pb ) of 170 mb ( 1341 mb ) corresponds to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the total geometric cross section . to enhance the reach in @xmath14 , a high - energy photon ( hep ) trigger based on the energy signal in the lead glass calorimeter was used .",
    "the fully corrected inclusive photon yields in p+c and p+pb collisions at @xmath2 are presented in figure [ paincgamma ] . the transition from the minimum bias to the hep data sample occurs at @xmath15 .    in order to get",
    "the direct - photon excess @xmath16 , the contribution @xmath17 from decay photons has to be subtracted from the inclusive photon yield @xmath18 .",
    "this can be done by calculating the direct - photon yield @xmath16 as a fraction of the inclusive photon spectrum : @xmath19 the neutral pion yields have been presented in @xcite . a monte - carlo simulation based on the measured neutral pion yields was used to determine the simulated @xmath20-ratio .",
    "the simulation uses a parameterization of the measured neutral pion spectrum as input and simulates the photonic decays of the relevant mesons , e.g. @xmath21 .",
    "the simulated and measured @xmath20-ratios and the corresponding double - ratio @xmath22 for p+pb and p+c collisions are presented in figure [ ratios ] . while the measured @xmath20-ratio is systematically above the simulated one for both targets , @xmath22 is consistent with unity in the @xmath6 range relevant for a thermal contribution .",
    "the resulting direct - photon yields are presented in figure [ paspectrapanel ] .",
    "significant data points can only be quoted for the highest transverse momenta .",
    "as the p+a data should not exhibit a thermal contribution , any significant excess of the direct photons from pb+pb collisions over the p+a results , scaled by the average number of nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath23 as described in @xcite , can be attributed to a thermal source .",
    "the yields are compared in figure  [ paspectrapanel ] . as both data sets agree within errors , no further limit on the contribution of prompt direct photons can be set .",
    "direct photon yields in p+c and p+pb collisions at @xmath2 were measured by the wa98 experiment .",
    "upper limits and invariant photon yields for direct photons as a function of @xmath6 could be derived from both data sets . when compared to the results on direct photon production in pb+pb collisions by applying @xmath23 scaling , no additional constraints on the prompt direct photon production in this system can be set from the new p+c and p+pb data .",
