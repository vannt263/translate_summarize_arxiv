    "two themes are presently prevailing in the discussion of nuclear multifragmentation . one of them concerns the order of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition .",

    "the second class of questions is related to the nuclear equation of state and to its importance for astrophysical processes .",
    "supernova simulations or neutron star models require inputs for the nuclear equation of state at extreme values of density and asymmetry for which the predictions differ widely @xcite .",
    "fragmentation reactions are of interest here because they permit the production of nuclear systems with subnuclear densities and temperatures which , e.g. , largely overlap with those expected for the explosion stages of core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "laboratory studies of the properties of nuclear matter in the hot environment , similar to the astrophysical situation , are thus becoming feasible , and an active search for suitable observables is presently underway .",

    ", the possibility of using secondary beams for reaction studies at relativistic energies has been explored .",
    "beams of @xmath3sn , @xmath2sn , @xmath2la , and @xmath5au as well as sn and au targets were used to investigate the mass and isospin dependence of projectile fragmentation at 600 mev per nucleon .",
    "the neutron - poor radioactive projectiles @xmath3sn and @xmath2la were produced at the fragment separator frs by fragmentation of a primary beam of @xmath6nd and delivered to the aladin experiment .",
    "the data analysis performed so far includes isotopic effects in neutron and fragment production , isoscaling and its relation to the properties of hot fragments at the low - density freeze - out , flow in mass - symmetric collisions at intermediate energy , transparency in central collisions at intermediate energies as obtained from isospin tracing , as well as size fluctuations of the heaviest fragment of the partition and their relation to the order of the phase transition @xcite . in the following",

    "freeze - out occurs in the coexistence zone below the critical temperature and at densities equivalent to a fraction of the normal nuclear density .",
    "new evidence has also been obtained for the equilibrium nature of the freeze - out configurations .",
    "for example , the systematics of fragment multiplicity versus excitation energy compiled by tamain @xcite shows that multifragmentation is a universal phenomenon driven by the thermal excitation of the system , fairly independent of the type of collision through which it is imparted .",

    "the hot fragments exhibit the linear relation of @xmath50 with @xmath49 as expected but , for @xmath49 smaller than 25 mev , the sequential decay causes a narrowing of the initially broad isotope distributions which leads to larger @xmath50 for the decay products .",
    "the variation of @xmath50 with @xmath49 is thus considerably reduced and the value @xmath73 measured for the most central bins is only reproduced with input values @xmath74 10 mev , according to the calculations .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) and a systematics is emerging .",
    "a very recent interpretation of these results arrives at the conclusion that it is the reduced density rather than the elevated temperature which causes the symmetry term to be smaller than the standard value  @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses a temperature independent potential part of the symmetry term and a kinetic part in the form of a fermi gas .",
    "consequences of the low - density of the considered homogeneous system thus have to be assumed to be preserved in the process of fragment formation .",
    "statistical multifragmentation models as , e.g. , the smm  @xcite consider normal - density fragments statistically distributed within an expanded volume . here",
    "a reduction of the symmetry term can be imagined to be caused by a modification of the fragments in the hot environment , including deformations or nuclear interactions between them .",
    "the neglect of such effects in the actual codes should probably be regarded as an idealization as the assumption of equilibrium at the final freeze - out stage requires interactions in order to achieve it .",
    "fragment formation out of an expanded system can thus naturally explain variations of the symmetry term .",
    "the consequences for the predictions of this class of models are rather small since the partitioning is predominantly driven by the surface term in the liquid - drop description of the fragments while a variation of the symmetry term affects mainly the isotopic distributions @xcite .",
    "further studies will be needed in order to quantitatively establish the reduction of the symmetry term .",
    "the sequential decay corrections are obviously important but also the evolution of the isotopic compositions during the reaction process deserves attention .",
