    "the combination of nonperturbative unitary techniques in coupled channels with the qcd information contained in the chiral lagrangians has allowed one to extend the application domain of traditional chiral perturbation theory to a much larger range of energies where many low lying meson and baryon resonances appear . for instance , for the interactions between the members of the lightest octet of pseudoscalars , one starts with the chiral lagrangian of ref .",
    "@xcite and selects the set of channels that couple to certain quantum numbers .",
    "then , independently of using either the bethe - salpeter equation in coupled channels @xcite , the n / d method @xcite or the inverse amplitude one @xcite , the well known scalar resonances @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 appear as poles in the obtained l=0 meson - meson partial waves .",
    "these resonances are not introduced by hand , they appear naturally as a consequence of the meson interaction and they qualify as ordinary bound states or resonances in coupled channels . these are states that we call dynamically generated , by contrast to other states which would rather qualify as @xmath7 states , such as the @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , in the baryon sector , the interaction of the pseudoscalar mesons with baryons of the octet of the proton generates dynamically @xmath9 resonances @xcite and the interaction of the pseudoscalar mesons with baryons of the decuplet of the @xmath10 generates @xmath11 resonances @xcite . these last two cases can be unified using su(6 ) symmetry as done in @xcite .",
    "this field has proved quite productive and has been further expanded by combining pseudoscalar mesons with vector mesons , which lead to the dynamical generation of axial vector mesons like the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc @xcite .",
    "also in the charm sector one has obtained in this way scalar mesons with charm , like the @xmath14 @xcite , axial vector mesons with charm like the @xmath15 @xcite , or hidden charm scalars like a predicted @xmath16 state and two hidden charm axial states , with opposite c - parity , one of which corresponds to the @xmath17 state . in what follows",
    "we briefly discuss these latter cases .",
    "as shown in detail in @xcite , starting from a standard chiral lagrangian for the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons of the octet of the @xmath18 and vector mesons of the octet of the @xmath8 , and unitarizing in coupled channels solving the coupled bethe - salpeter equations , one obtains the scattering matrix for pseudoscalar mesons with vectors for different quantum numbers , which contains poles that can be associated to known resonances like the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc .",
    "the su(3 ) decomposition of @xmath19 @xmath20 leads here to two octets , unlike in the case of the interaction of pseudoscalars among themselves where there is only room for the @xmath21 representation .",
    "this is why here one finds different g - parity states like the @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , plus an extra @xmath26 that one can identify with the singlet state .",
    "one should then find two @xmath27 states , which do not have defined g - parity .",
    "one might think that these states are the @xmath0 and the @xmath28 states .",
    "however the theory fails to predict a state with such a large mass as the @xmath28 and with its decay properties .",
    "instead , in @xcite two states were found with masses close by , given , after some fine tunning , by 1197 mev and 1284 mev , and widths of about 240 mev and 140 mev , respectively .",
    "the interesting thing about these states is that the first one couples most strongly to @xmath29 , while the second state couples most strongly to @xmath30 .",
    "one could hope that these two states could be observed experimentally .",
    "indeed , this is the case as was shown in the recent work @xcite by looking at two reactions which have either @xmath29 or @xmath30 in the final state and which clearly show the peak at different positions , as one can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : cern3 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     very interesting and novel of the present approach is the generation of the x(3872 ) with positive c - parity and another state nearly degenerate with negative c - parity",
    ". it would be interesting to see if a state with negative c - parity is observed , but the large branching fraction @xmath31 indicates either a very large g - parity ( isospin ) violation ( quite unlikely ) , or the existence of another state with different c - parity ( g - parity also in this case ) .",
    "we discussed before how the low lying @xmath9 baryon resonances appear dynamically generated in the chiral unitary approach .",
    "the low lying @xmath1 resonances are not less problematic and quark models have difficulties in reproducing them @xcite .",
    "experimentally some of them are poorly understood , few of them possess four - star status and three possess three - star status . among the rest",
    "some resonances are listed with unknown spin parity and two are controversial in nature .",
    "the situation is slightly better with the @xmath32 resonances in the same energy region , except for the @xmath32(1600 ) and @xmath32(1810 ) , where the peak positions and widths , obtained by different partial wave analysis groups , vary a lot .",
    "many of these s=@xmath2 states seem to have significant branching ratios for three - body , i.e. , two meson - one baryon , decay channels .",
    "however , no theoretical attempt has been made to study the three body structure of these resonances , until recently when a coupled channel calculation for two meson one baryon system was carried out using chiral dynamics @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that there are strong correlations in the meson baryon sector in l=0 , and with s=@xmath2 one obtains many @xmath9 resonances .",
    "the @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) couples strongly to the @xmath35 and its coupled channels . considering this we build the three body coupled channels by adding a pion to combinations of a pseudoscalar meson of the @xmath36 su(3 ) octet and a baryon of the @xmath1 octet which couple to @xmath37 . for the total charge zero of the three body system we get twenty - two coupled channels .    to solve the faddeev equations we write the two body @xmath38-matrices using unitary chiral dynamics .",
    "these @xmath38-matrices can be split into an on - shell part , depending only on the respective center of mass energy , and an off - shell part , which is inversely proportional to the propagator of the off - shell particle .",
    "this off - shell part cancels a propagator in the three body scattering diagrams , leading to a diagram with a topological structure equivalent to that of a three body force @xcite . to this",
    ", one must add the three body forces originating directly from the chiral lagrangians .",
    "interestingly , in our case , we find the three forces from the two sources to get canceled in the su(3 ) limit and in case of low momentum transfer to the baryon . in a realistic case ,",
    "we find them to sum - up to merely 5 % of the total on - shell contribution of the @xmath38-matrices to the faddeev equations . the formalism is thus developed further in terms of the on - shell parts of the two body @xmath38-matrices .",
    "we begin with faddeev equations @xmath39,\\ ] ] which if iterated while neglecting the terms with @xmath40 , which correspond to the disconnected diagrams , will give @xmath41    in order to factorize the faddeev equations one writes the terms with three successive interactions explicitly , which already involve a loop evaluation .",
    "one finds technically how to go from the diagrams with two interactions to those with three interactions and the algorithm found is then used for the next iterations , leading thus to a set of algebraic equations , which are solved within twenty two coupled channels .",
    "the resulting equations have been solved with the input two body @xmath38-matrices obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation as in @xcite .",
    "we find four @xmath42 and two @xmath32 states @xcite as dynamically generated resonances in the two meson - one baryon systems , implying a strong coupling of the s=@xmath2 resonances , in this region , to the three body decay channels . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show one of the resonances , corresponding to the @xmath42(1660 ) @xcite found in our study in the squared amplitude for the @xmath43 channel .",
    "in addition to this , we find evidence for ( 1 ) another @xmath1 resonance , i.e. , the @xmath42(1770 ) , ( 2 ) for the controversial @xmath42(1620 ) and ( 3 ) for the @xmath42(1560 ) , which is listed with unknown spin - parity @xcite . in the isospin",
    "0 sector we find evidence for the @xmath32 ( 1600 ) and @xmath32 ( 1810 ) . to conclude",
    ", we are finding a new picture for the low lying @xmath1 baryon states which largely correspond to bound states or resonances of two mesons and a baryon .",
