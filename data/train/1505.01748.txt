    "a fundamental property that distinguishes quantum correlation @xcite , which is a staple resource for exotic quantum information processing and computational tasks @xcite , from classical correlation is its distribution among several parties in a quantum system .",
    "classical correlation can be distributed among any number of parties , with each pair attaining the maximum possible correlation . however , for quantum correlations , there exist strong constraints on its sharability among the different parties of a multiparty system .",
    "such constraints form the basis for the concept of monogamy of quantum correlations  among three parties , if two possess maximal quantum correlations , they can not have _ any _ quantum correlation with the third party .",
    "all quantum correlation measures obey this qualitative monogamy relation while classical correlations do not @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in general",
    ", monogamy implies that if two systems are strongly correlated with respect to a nonclassical quantity , they can only be weakly correlated with respect to the same quantity to a third system .",
    "this property is satisfied by a host of nonclassical quantities including those related to bell @xcite and contextual inequalities @xcite , quantum steering witnesses @xcite , and dense - coding capacities @xcite .",
    "the quantitative version of the monogamy constraint @xcite is satisfied by entanglement monotones such as squared - concurrence @xcite , squared entanglement of formation @xcite , squared - negativity @xcite , and squashed entanglement @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the monogamy property is an important feature in quantum information theory @xcite and in essence captures the `` trade - off '' between various quantifiers of quantum and classical properties @xcite .",
    "it plays a significant role in the security of quantum key distribution @xcite and in the considerations leading to quantum advantage in dense - coding @xcite .",
    "further , it has been used to characterize three - qubit genuinely multiparty entangled states @xcite and distinguish bell - like orthonormal bases @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the perspective of quantum correlation , quantification of the monogamy property in multiparty systems is not very straightforward .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that quantum correlation shared among arbitrary parties in a multiparty system is not always computable , making the study of its distribution among several parties extremely difficult .",
    "however , there are ongoing efforts to overcome this constraint @xcite .",
    "further , characterization of both bipartite and multipartite quantum correlations in higher - dimensional mixed states is not well - developed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , various attempts have been made to systematically quantify the monogamy of quantum correlations .",
    "a seminal result was obtained in @xcite for the monogamy of squared concurrence @xcite in three - qubit states .",
    "it was demonstrated that , for a three - qubit state , @xmath0 , the sum of the squared concurrence between qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and that between qubits @xmath1 and @xmath3 , is bounded above by the squared concurrence between qubit @xmath1 and the joint subsystem @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the monogamy property was captured in the form of an inequality , known as the `` monogamy inequality '' .",
    "an advantage of this inequality is that it is a multiparty property expressed in terms of bipartite quantum correlation measures which are well - understood at least for two - qubit systems .",
    "the inequality was shown to hold for squared concurrence in multiqubit quantum states @xcite .",
    "however , it does not satisfy for some entanglement measures @xcite , such as entanglement of formation @xcite and logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "further , information - theoretic measures of quantum correlation , such as quantum discord @xcite and quantum work - deficit @xcite , are also known to violate the monogamy inequality for three - qubits @xcite .",
    "recent results on monogamy of quantum correlation have shown that the monogamy inequality is always satisfied for increasing powers of any quantum correlation measure @xcite or when large number of parties are considered @xcite .    in this paper , we establish a relation between monogamy of quantum correlation , quantified by using the concept of `` monogamy score '' @xcite , and genuine multiparty entanglement measures for @xmath5-qubit pure states .",
    "the connection holds irrespective of the number of parties and is independent of the choice of the bipartite quantum correlation measure used in the conceptualization of monogamy .",
    "we show that for a large majority of pure multiqubit states , the monogamy score for a broad range of quantum correlation measures is upper - bounded by a function of genuine multiparty entanglement in the system , as quantified by the generalized geometric measure @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . considering the squared concurrence and squared negativity as measures from the entanglement - separability paradigm , and quantum discord and quantum work - deficit as information - theoretic measures of quantum correlation",
    ", we analytically show that the bound is universally satisfied for all pure three - qubit states @xcite and find conditions for its validity in arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "we also identify a set of necessary conditions to be satisfied in order to violate the bound for more than three qubits .",
    "we numerically observe that these conditions are only satisfied for an extremely small set of @xmath5-qubit quantum states .",
    "in fact , by numerically generating random @xmath6- and @xmath7-qubit pure quantum states , using a uniform haar distribution , we find that the bound is never violated .",
    "the results show that the sharability of arbitrary bipartite quantum correlations in multisite quantum states is nontrivially limited by the multiparty entanglement content of the states irrespective of the number of parties .",

    "the monogamy relation is said to be monogamous , and otherwise it is non - monogamous .",

    "all monogamous quantum correlation measures have a positive monogamy score , for all multipartite states .",
    "an important aspect in defining both the monogamy inequality and the score is the role of the nodal qubit . for @xmath5",
    "= 3 , the monogamy score with respect to squared concurrence is independent of the choice of a nodal qubit @xcite .",
    "however , for other quantum correlation measures and for @xmath18 3 , this invariance is lost for general multiqubit states .",

    ", it follows that the quantity @xmath25 vanishes for all states that are biseparable across any partition and is non - zero otherwise .",
    "further , it is a valid entanglement monotone that is non - increasing under local operations and classical communication .",

    "the ggm for @xmath9 can be defined as @xcite @xmath26 where , @xmath27 is the maximal schmidt coefficient across the bipartition @xmath28 of the state @xmath9 .",
    "this allows one to compute @xmath25 in terms of the eigenvalues of its different reduced density matrices .",
