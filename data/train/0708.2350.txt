    "as the immediate precursors of white dwarfs , the central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspns ) provide fundamental tests in key areas of stellar astrophysics , including evolutionary theory , non - lte model atmospheres and plasma hydrodynamics .",
    "an important challenge is to understand details of the mass - loss process through the planetary nebula stage .",
    "specifically , the fast winds of cspn provide a probe of the _ current _ mass - loss , and represent a valuable setting for the study of radiative and mechanical interactions between stars and their environments .    shortly after the launch of the international ultraviolet explorer ( @xmath4 ) satellite , it became clear that fast winds are a common feature of cspn ( e.g. heap , 1979 ; perinotto , cerruti - sola , benvenuti , 1982 ) .",
    "the p  cygni uv resonance line profiles have been decoded to record maximum wind velocities of up to a few 1000 km s@xmath5 and estimates of the mass - loss rate range between @xmath2 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 yr@xmath5 ( see e.g. perinotto , 1989 and references within ) .",
    "our objective in this paper is to exploit new far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( @xmath0 ) satellite time - series spectroscopy of the central star of ngc  6543 to uniquely examine the time - variable characteristics of its fast wind .",
    "an improved understanding of variability and clumping in the fast winds of cspn is important for several reasons : temporally variable spatial structure implies a clumped and at least locally non - spherical fast wind , which can modify how the supersonic outflow interacts with the nebular material ( e.g. falle et al . 2002 ; steffen & lopez 2003 ) .",
    "substantial wind clumping can also significantly complicate determinations of the mass - loss rates from the central stars .",
    "for example , recent analyses of optical and uv lines in luminous , massive o - type stars have provided evidence for extreme wind clumping factors , with implications that the mass - loss rates of ob stars may have previously been over - estimated by factors of between 3 to 10 ( e.g. hillier , lanz & heap 2003 ; massa et al .",
    "2003 ; markova et al .",
    "2004 ; bouret , lanz & hillier 2005 ; fullerton , massa & prinja 2006 ) .",
    "recent @xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath3@xmath11 observations have established the presence of diffuse x - ray emission from _ within _ the nebular interior regions ( e.g. guerrero et al .",
    "2001 ; kastner et al . 2003 ; maness & vrtilek , 2003 ) .",
    "the source of the x - rays from the central star vicinity remains uncertain , and one possible origin would be the presence of shock - heated gas arising from instabilities in a variable fast wind ( e.g. akashi , soker & behar , 2006 ) .",
    "the present study is also motivated by a need to understand the relation between optical spectroscopic ( radial velocity ) and photometric changes evident in several cspn .",
    "the frequently imaged non - spherical and bipolar morphologies of the planetary nebulae ( e.g. zuckerman & aller , 1986 ) raise the possibility that the planetary nebulae may have been ejected via common envelope interaction in close binary central stars ( e.g. sandquist et al .",
    "surveys of the pn binary population are currently frustrated by the physical interpretation of the observed radial velocity and photometric variations , which might at least in part be due to changes in the fast wind ( e.g. handler , 2003 ; de marco et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    ".ngc  6543 central star parameters . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     models were run for cases of the clump volume filling factor , @xmath12 = 0.06 , 0.08 and 0.1 , and the synthesised spectra are compared in fig .",
    "10 to key wind lines in the @xmath0 and high - resolution @xmath4 data of the central star . for a mass - loss rate of 6 @xmath13 10@xmath14 m@xmath8 yr@xmath5",
    "the models provide good overall fits to the observed resonance and excited state line profiles .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pv lines are particularly sensitive to the clumping factor , more so than ov and niv .",
    "our data favour the case of @xmath12 = 0.08 , though of course we neglect here the consequences of these parameters for reproducing diagnostic optical lines in the central star of ngc  6543 , such as heii @xmath154686 and civ @xmath155801 .",
    "figure 11 displays the predicted ionization fractions of p@xmath16 , p@xmath17 , and p@xmath18 as a function of velocity , and for the three different clumping factors .",
    "the dominance of p@xmath18 at low velocities results in the mis - match with the observed profile seen in this region ( fig .",
    "the ion fractions of p@xmath16 and p@xmath17 increase over all velocities for lower values of @xmath12 , with an increased recombination from p@xmath18 to p@xmath17 particularly evident at the highest velocities .",
    "the cmfgen models run here generally predict c@xmath17 and p@xmath18 as dominant ( i.e. @xmath19 @xmath20 0.97 over @xmath2 0.2 to 0.9 @xmath21 ) , and s@xmath18 and o@xmath17 close to dominant ( i.e. @xmath19 @xmath2 0.6 and 0.2 , respectively ) .",
    "our results indicate that pv is a sensitive spectral diagnostic of _ small - scale _ clumping in the fast wind , together with the large - scale structures represented by the dacs discussed in sect .",
    "we highlight the need to adopt fairly small volume filling factors in order to match the pv resonance line doublet .",
    "p@xmath17 is a trace ion , just below dominant ( fig .",
    "11 ) , and is therefore extremely sensitive to changes as parameterised here , since its abundance depends strongly on density .",
    "this is in contrast to the results for o stars presented by bouret et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where p@xmath17 is dominant and not as sensitive to small fluctuations in density .",
    "the empirical evidence presented here suggests that ( i ) the fast wind of ngc  6543 is highly variable on time - scales of hours , ( ii ) the wind changes are systematic in terms of recurrent absorptive optical depth structures that migrate blueward , and ( iii ) the temporal behaviour of the pv resonance line p  cygni profiles is very similar to that due to the presence of ` discrete absorption components ' ( dacs ) in luminous ob stars .",
    "a comparison between the dac properties of ngc  6543 and a ` representative ' mid - o giant is presented in table  3 , where the latter is summarised from various studies ( see e.g. those cited in sect .",
    "we note that the fundamental characteristics such as initial detection at low doppler velocities , recurrence , modulation , and optical depth contrast are broadly similar for both cases ; the same is also true for the ( linear ) acceleration scaled by the flow time - scale ( r@xmath22/@xmath21 ) .",
    "there is some indication that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the dacs in ngc  6543 is somewhat smaller than for a typical o - type giant ( such as @xmath23 per or 68 cygni ) .",
    "our interpretation of these results therefore is that the physical mechanism responsible for the dac structures in the fast wind of ngc  6543 is likely the same as that acting in massive ob stars .",
    "there remain several uncertainties in our understanding of this phenomena in massive stars , but in the particular case where quasi - periodic wind variability is detected , several authors have promoted a scenario in terms of co - rotating interaction regions ( cirs ; e.g. cranmer & owocki 1996 ; fullerton et al .",
    "1997 ; de jong et al .",
    "the notion is that the dacs are spectroscopic signatures of spatial structures in the wind that are causally connected to stellar surface irregularities .",
    "these photospheric inhomogeneities cause the wind from different longitudinal sectors on the stellar surface to emerge with different densities and/or velocities .",
    "the consequence is to form different adjacent streams that meet to create spiral - shaped cirs .",
    "key observational properties of the dacs can be matched with this model , with variable optical depth enhancements arising from the combination of a plateau in the radial velocity as well as a density perturbation . in this model ,",
    "the variations in absorption which occurs over significantly larger time - scales than the wind flow speed are due to gas flowing through a semi - permanent , co - rotating structure .",
    "the rotation rate of the central star in ngc  6543 is unfortunately not known , and we are unable to comment further in this context on the significance of the @xmath2 0.17-day period identified in sect .",
    "4 . in the case of ob stars",
    "the recurrence of dacs is mostly only quasi - cyclic , and has only rarely been demonstrated to be an integer relation to the stellar rotation rate .",
    "nevertheless , our results provide the constraint that the mechanism for forming coherent perturbations in the outflows is apparently operating equally in the radiation - pressure - driven winds of widely differing momenta ( @xmath24@xmath21@xmath25 ) and flow times , as represented by ob stars and cspn .    as regards the ` trigger ' provided by photospheric irregularities for the growth of wind structure , the action of surface velocity fields due to pulsation and/or ordered magnetic fields may be just as applicable to cspn as it is to ob stars .",
    "multi - period pulsation modes are thought to be the cause of short - period ( @xmath2 hourly ) variability seen in the photometric measurements of several central stars , including both h - rich and h - deficient cases ( e.g. handler et al .",
    "1997 ; ciardullo & bond 1996 ) .",
    "kilogauss strength magnetic fields have also been detected ( using spectropolarimetry ) that are associated with the pn central stars ( e.g. jordan , werner & otoole 2005 ) , where they may be located mostly in the envelope , as opposed to the degenerate core , and can be affected by mass - loss .",
    "one caveat here is that the link between pulsation or magnetic fields and repetitive wind structures in ob stars has thus far proved observationally very challenging and generally unconstrained ; establishing such a connection in cspn is going to be even more difficult !    the _ ab inito _ cmfgen calculations presented in sect .",
    "5 favour a small clump volume filling factor , f@xmath26 @xmath2 0.08 . whether or not the parameterisation of clumping incorporated in cmfgen is physically meaningful , we note that the high sensitivity of the pv lines to the clumping factor is again similar to that apparent for the same line in o - type stars . following the clumping studies of e.g. markova et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , bouret et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , fullerton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , our results for ngc  6543 would imply a reduction by a factor @xmath2 4 ( i.e. 1/@xmath27 ) in the mass - loss rate due to the clumped fast wind compared to smooth - wind models .",
    "the analysis of _ optical _ lines with the non - lte code fastwind by kudrtizki , urbaneja & puls 2006 ) also points to substantially clumped cspn fast winds .",
    "downward revisions in the central star mass - loss rate would affect the dynamics of the hot central cavity excavated by the fast wind , thus modifying its interaction with the surrounding nebula , including contributions to the x - ray emission . naturally our far - uv analyses needs to be extended to cover a large sample of central stars to permit firm assessments of any revisions to cspn mass - loss rates , and most importantly , tested for consistency between uv and optical diagnostics of clumping .",
    "finally , looking ahead , the vastly increased sensitivity soon to be offered at radio wave - bands by the upgraded e - merlin and evla facilities raises new possibilities for measuring the free - free emission from the fast wind itself and thus provide a powerful new constraint on the central star mass - loss .",
