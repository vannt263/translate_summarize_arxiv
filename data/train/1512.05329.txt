    "the recent accelerated expansion of the universe and its cause is one of the most puzzling mysteries in cosmology and physics today . since the observations of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) reported by two groups  @xcite",
    ", a lot of observations have been accumulating to indicate that the universe is well described by the @xmath3cdm model ( for recent observational results , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "although the cosmological constant ( cc ) gives a good fit to the data and explains well the current cosmic acceleration , future observations promise to provide much tighter constraints of the models .",
    "that motivated theorists to explore other possibilities , which generically came to be known as _ dark energy _ ( de ) ( for a review on dark energy see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "the origin of dark energy could be matter whose properties mimic those of cosmological constant , but it could be also in the modification of gravity on cosmological scales  @xcite .",
    "in fact , due to the intricate coupling between gravity and matter in some theories , it is not always possible to tell whether dark energy comes from a new kind of matter or from a modification of gravity .    in this work",
    "we examine the idea that dark energy originates from the backreaction of quantum fluctuations originating in the primordial inflationary universe .",
    "the idea that the origin of dark energy can be linked to primordial inflation has not been widely explored ( for an early attempt to link the cause of inflation with the cause of dark energy see ref .",
    "@xcite , for a more recent attempt see  @xcite ) .",
    "also , early attempts  @xcite to link quantum fluctuations of the _ inflaton _ to dark energy turned out not to be correct @xcite . indeed , a careful one - loop calculation of the energy - momentum tensor from inflationary gravitons  @xcite , and an educated estimate of the corresponding energy - momentum tensor from scalar cosmological perturbations  @xcite shows that , rather than contributing to dark energy , these inflationary perturbations contribute a tiny amount ( about @xmath4 of the critical density today ) to dark matter .",
    "recently , the idea of relating quantum backreaction to dark energy has again drawn some attention , and here we give a brief overview . in @xcite",
    "the minimally coupled massless spectator scalar was studied where it was found that the quantum backreaction in late - time matter era scales just as nonrelativistic matter fluid driving the background expansion , but its fraction is tiny , about @xmath4 of the critical density .",
    "this ratio is determined by the same ratio reached by the end of inflation , and it effectively freezes afterwards .",
    "the same was concluded for the contribution from gravitons .",
    "the result for scalars was subsequently confirmed in @xcite .",
    "there it was also investigated what are the influences of possible pre - inflationary periods on the magnitude of late - time quantum backreaction , and it was found it could be increased if additional inflationary periods at a much higher ( planck ) energy scale existed prior to the standard one , but the late - time scaling can not be changed .",
    "however , when one considers the quantum backreaction from inflationary quantum fluctuations of a massless non - minimally coupled spectator scalar field , and when the relevant non - minimal coupling is negative ( such that it gives a tachyonic mass to the scalar during inflation ) , then under reasonable conditions on inflation and non - minimal coupling , the scalar field can yield a large quantum backreaction at late times  @xcite , making it potentially a candidate for dark energy ( the analysis performed in  @xcite is perturbative , and hence any statements about whether that is a reliable candidate for dark energy can not be made ) . in this model",
    "the backreaction can grow considerably during inflation ( even to nonperturbative values ) , how fast depending on the nonminimal coupling ( this was already found in @xcite for more general slow - roll inflation ) , so its ratio to the background fluid is greatly enhanced compared to the minimally coupled case .",
    "this ratio again freezes during radiation period , but starts to evolve again in matter period .",
    "another idea involves the late - time quantum backreaction from inflationary quantum fluctuations of a very light spectator scalar field  @xcite , where the backreaction contributes like a cc at late - time matter era . in order for this idea to work , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite needed to lower the scale of inflation and furthermore they needed a humongously large number of e - foldings of inflation ( @xmath5 ) . in a more recent paper  @xcite it was pointed out that the mechanism works as well for inflation at the grand - unified scale and that the required number of e - foldings is ` only ' about @xmath6 .",
    "when compared with the original work  @xcite , that was a significant improvement . in  @xcite it",
    "was also studied how some pre - inflationary periods can lead to lowering the requirements on the number of e - foldings of this model where they managed to get it down to @xmath7 with the assumption of another planck scale inflationary period preceding the gut scale one .",
    "apart from various technical improvements , the goal of this paper is to study the late - time quantum backreaction from inflationary quantum fluctuations of scalar fields and its relation to dark energy in more general models , without relying on any pre - inflationary physics , and one of the important result of this work is the realization that the simple addition of a small non - minimal coupling to the ricci scalar can completely alleviate the constraint on the length of inflation . we show that the late time one - loop quantum backreaction from a nonminimally coupled , light spectator scalar field can be a good candidate for dark energy . in our model conditions on inflation are completely relaxed : inflation can occur at the grand unified scale and it can last as little as hundreds of e - foldings .",
    "the model of a very light , nonminimally coupled spectator scalar was studied and proposed as a dark energy model very soon after the discovery of the recent accelerated expansion of the universe by parker and raval  @xcite . in those works the main effect derives from the ultraviolet quantum fluctuations , as opposed to the work presented here where the main contribution to the energy - momentum tensor comes from the infrared ( super - hubble ) quantum fluctuations .",
    "we provide a more detailed comparison of our work with that of parker and raval in section  [ sec : discussion and outlook ] .",
    "quantum fluctuations of fields are generally nonvanishing , so we expect them to contribute as corrections to the classical einstein s equations .",
    "this statement can be neatly summarized by the following equation , @xmath8 \\ , , \\label{semiclassicalgr}\\ ] ] which can be recognized as a quantum corrected einstein s equation the two source terms on the right are the classical energy - momentum tensor of matter fields , and the _ quantum backreaction _",
    ", respectively .",
    "the quantum backreaction is the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor operator of quantum fluctuations of matter fields , and the metric field .",
    "the evidence that quantum fluctuations indeed interact gravitationally comes from studying the fluctuations in the spectrum of the cmb , and ultimately attributing it to the spectrum of primordial inflationary quantum scalar fluctuations . as opposed to the spatial variations of the quantum fluctuations , which ultimately contribute to the cmb temperature fluctuations , here we study the homogeneous nonvanishing contribution of quantum fluctuations .",
    "we want to study the effects of the backreaction term in cosmology , in particular its influence on the dynamics of the large scale expansion of the universe , and its possible connection to the dark energy problem .",
    "that is a rather ambitious task , and in this work we opt to address less ambitious , but still very important questions :    * can the backreaction every become large enough to influence the expansion dynamics ? * when does it become large and how it depends on the parameters of the model and the expansion history ?",
    "* what is the behaviour of the backreaction when it becomes large and does it tend to accelerate the expansion ?",
    "since we are interested in modeling de , we want the backreaction not to spoil the previous expansion history .",
    "therefore , its influence on the expansion has to be negligibly small up until the recent onset of accelerated expansion .",
    "therefore , we study equation perturbatively , in the sense that we do not consider the backreaction actually backreacting on the classical evolution , since it is small by assumption ( we thoroughly check whether this assumption is satisfied in different epochs in the history of the universe ) .",
    "the formalism appropriate for this study is the quantum field theory in curved space - time , originating in the late 60 s and early 70 s  , and by now a well established subject , covered in standard references @xcite . of course , when the backreaction becomes large , this approach breaks down , and a full self - consistent solution is needed .",
    "here we study the backreaction from quantum fluctuations of a very light , nonminimally coupled , spectator scalar field as they evolve from an initial state specified at the beginning of inflationary period of our universe , through the radiation and matter dominated era , up until the onset of the late - time acceleration period ( see fig .",
    "[ expansion history ] for the schematic depiction of the expansion history ) .",
    "the leading order contribution to one - loop expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor of these quantum fluctuations is computed in each era , as a controlled expansion in small ratios of physical parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the following section introduces definitions and conventions for the cosmological space - time .",
    "the third section presents the scalar field model , outlines its quantization , and defines the main quantities to be computed  the scalar field mode function and the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor . the representation and approximations of the evolution of the mode function",

    "that is namely necessary to regulate the infrared ( ir ) modes since attempting to impose the usual bunch - davies condition on the infrared modes would produce unphysical infrared divergences in the initial one - loop energy - momentum tensor .",

    "the deep ir suppression can be attributed to some physical process during or before inflation , or can be viewed as an approximation to the state obtained by placing the universe in a co - moving box .",
    "one can show  @xcite that , to leading order in powers of the ir comoving cutoff @xmath96 , ( expectation values of ) physical observables are correctly reproduced by the sudden cutoff approximation .",

    "generally , the full mode function during a given constant @xmath40 period will be a linear combination of the ctbd mode functions , @xmath109 coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 are called the bogolyubov coefficients , and they have to satisfy @xmath112 as dictated by the wronskian normalization .",
    "they are determined for each era by the initial conditions at the beginning of the given era , which are in turn given by the details of the transition from one era to another .    if @xmath48 is a small time scale of the transition between periods , then for momenta above this scale the bogolyubov coefficients must reduce to @xmath113 nonadiabatically , meaning faster than any power of @xmath114 .",

    "the physical reason behind this conclusion is that the deep uv modes oscillate so fast so that their evolution is adiabatic .    in the ir ,",
    "bogolyubov coefficients are not universal as the deep uv are . on the contrary ,",
    "they do depend on the details of the transition between the two periods of constant @xmath40 . in case of a fast transition",
    "they are not so sensitive ( to leading order ) to the details of the transition , but rather depend just on the two periods connected by the transition .",
    "this we show in the next subsection .      in case of fast transitions between constant @xmath40 periods , @xmath117 ,",

    "[ expansion history ] , it is convenient to split the history of the universe into relatively long epochs , during which the principal slow roll parameter , @xmath402 , is to a good approximation constant , and relatively short transition periods , during which @xmath40 rapidly changes . we show that , provided the transition periods are sufficiently short ( for the transition in question that means that the characteristic time scale must be shorter than the hubble time at the transition ) , they can be treated in a sudden transition approximation .",

    "there is a simple explanation for this large difference : while the rate of particle production in the minimally coupled case generates secular effects in the one - loop energy - momentum tensor that grow linearly in time , due to the tachyonic scalar mass generated by a negative @xmath1 during inflation particle production rate in the nonminimally coupled case generates an exponentially growing contribution to the one - loop energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this , at first sight small difference in the model , has thus very important consequences for model building and arguably favors scalar models with negative non - minimal coupling as the model of choice for dark energy from inflationary quantum fluctuations .",
    "this paper is not the first to investigate the possibility that vacuum fluctuations of matter fields may be responsible for dark energy and here we make a cursory overview of these earlier works .",
    "apart from our earlier papers  @xcite , in which we investigated the late - time one - loop quantum backreaction from one - loop inflationary fluctuations of massless and minimally and nonminimally coupled scalars , and of gravitons , probably the closest to our work are the papers of ringeval , suyama , takahashi , yamaguchi and yokoyama  @xcite , of aoki and iso  @xcite , results of which we discussed in the previous paragraph , and of parker and raval  @xcite , and of parker and vanzella  @xcite .",

    "however , in  @xcite , a careful removal of all cut - off dependences , and a careful construction of approximate mode functions in matter era are not accounted for , which we properly include in this paper . in a series of papers that appeared soon after the original supernovae results , parker and raval  @xcite used the effective gravitational action obtained by integrating out the matter fields .",
    "the method used was the schwinger - dewitt proper time method and @xmath427 function regularization  @xcite , which is an ultraviolet expansion of the effective action ( that holds at short geodesic distances ) , and the final effective action is presented as an expansion in powers of @xmath428 , where @xmath429 is the effective mass of the field ( in the case of a non - minimally coupled scalar , @xmath430 , where @xmath54 is the tree - level scalar mass and @xmath431 denotes the ricci scalar curvature ) . in their effective action parker and raval maintain the terms of the order @xmath432 , @xmath433 , @xmath434 , @xmath435 , @xmath436 , and @xmath437 , thus neglecting the inverse powers of @xmath433 . strictly speaking ,",

    "the perturbative treatment executed in this work fails as soon as the one - loop backreaction terms become comparable with the background contributions @xmath450 and @xmath451 .",
    "the idea of the upcoming work  @xcite is to extend the starobinsky s stochastic formalism   for inflation to subsequent epochs and solve the resulting scalar field equations together with the friedmann equations ( that include the backreaction from the field fluctuations ) .",
    "this will allow us to get detailed predictions on how the ( global ) hubble parameter depends on time when the backreaction starts dominating , and study its dependence on the principal parameters of our model : @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath306 .",
    "of course the choice of these parameters is already quite limited by the constraints discussed at length in this work .",
    "the results of the self - consistent study can then be used to confront the model with the existing ( and upcoming ) data that already today put rather strict constraints on the recent evolution of dark energy .    while in the initial work in ref .  @xcite we intend to study the dynamics of the universe in the gaussian approximation , in the follow up",
    "work we intend to generalize that work and calculate ( perturbatively ) the higher order ( non - gaussian ) correlators , which can be used to further test the model .",

    "we expect that our model makes very specific predictions on how large non - gaussian features in dark energy are today and how they evolve in recent times .",
    "next , we would like to make theoretical improvements of the model discussed in this work .",
    "in order for our model to work , the scalar field mass has to be very light .",
    "more precisely , it has to satisfy  ( [ ultralight mass and small xi ] ) , which means that @xmath54 has to be smaller than the hubble scale at the onset of de domination , @xmath452 .",
