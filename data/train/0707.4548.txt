    "the precise knowledge of the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction rate is essential in two distinct fields of nuclear astrophysics : in the hydrogen - burning of the sun ( and similar main sequence stars ) and in the big - bang nucleosynthesis . in the pp - chain of solar hydrogen burning",
    "the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction is the staring point of the 2nd and 3rd branches of the chain from where the high energy @xmath2be and @xmath5b neutrinos are originated .",
    "owing to the fast technical development of neutrino detectors , the study of the solar neutrinos has entered a high precision era .",
    "the flux of the @xmath5b neutrinos has already been measured by the sno and superkamiokande neutrino detectors @xcite with a precision of 3.5% and similar precision is foreseen for the @xmath2be neutrino flux in the near future @xcite . as the solar neutrino puzzle has been solved by the experimental observation of neutrino oscillation @xcite ,",
    "the precise knowledge of the solar neutrino fluxes allows a more detailed test of the prediction of the standard solar model ( ssm ) .",
    "the ssm uses a number of input parameters to predict the solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "these input parameters include on one hand some solar properties ( like the luminosity , radiative opacity , diffusion , elemental composition ) and on the other hand the rates of nuclear reactions involved in the pp - chain .",
    "the uncertainty in the input parameters translates directly into uncertainties in the neutrino flux prediction .",
    "therefore , the reduction of the input parameter uncertainties is required to carry out a more stringent test of ssm . from the nuclear physics parameters the rate of the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction has the highest uncertainty .",
    "its 9% error @xcite at solar energies ( which was reduced to about 5% by a recent work @xcite ) contributes 8% @xcite to the uncertainty in the predicted fluxes for solar @xmath2be and @xmath5b neutrinos .    from the very precise measurement of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation by the wmap satellite ,",
    "the barion - to - photon ratio in our universe is known with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "since this ratio is the only free parameter in big - bang nucleosynthesis calculations , the abundances of the primordial elements ( d , @xmath0he , @xmath6he , @xmath2li ) can be calculated unambiguously and the results can be compared with astronomical observations . while there is a perfect agreement between the observations and calculations for the d abundance and reasonably good agreement for @xmath6he ,",
    "the predicted abundance of @xmath2li is a factor 2 to 3 higher than the observed one . at the measured barion - to - photon ratio @xmath2li",
    "is produced almost exclusively by the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction followed by the @xmath7-decay of @xmath2be .",
    "therefore , the abundance of primordial @xmath2li depends on the rate of this reaction .",
    "the precise knowledge of this reaction rate is the necessary basis of the search for possible solutions to the @xmath2li problem .",
    "the rate of the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be can be determined from the reaction cross section at energies relevant for the astrophysical site in question .",
    "hydrogen burning in the core of the sun takes place at roughly 15@xmath810@xmath9k temperature corresponding to a relevant energy range of 10 to 35 kev for the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction .",
    "owing to the higher temperatures involved , the relevant energy range for the big - bang nucleosynthesis spans from 160 to 380 kev . at these deep sub - coulomb energies",
    "the reaction cross section has very low values from a few hundreds of nanobarn at the highest big bang energies down to the attobarn range for the pp chain energies .",
    "while direct measurement of the cross section is possible at big - bang energies , the cross section at solar energies can only be calculated by extrapolating the high energy data towards low energies using theoretical considerations .",
    "the extrapolation is normally done with the help of the astrophysical @xmath4 factor which does not contain the trivial energy dependence of the coulomb barrier penetration and which has a finite value at zero energy .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 factor is usually extrapolated to zero energy instead of a ( temperature dependent ) finite energy of astrophysical relevance . since the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction at low energies proceeds through the direct capture process , different theoretical approaches lead to very similar energy dependence of the @xmath4 factor , though small deviations can be found .",
    "the only free parameter in the extrapolations for a certain theoretical model is the absolute magnitude of the @xmath4 factor .",
    "this parameter can be obtained by normalizing the theoretical energy dependence to measured values at energies where data are available .",
    "therefore , it is important to measure the cross section of @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be with high precision and at energies preferably relevant directly to the big - bang nucleosynthesis and low enough that the extrapolation to zero energy could be done with low uncertainty despite the small differences in various theoretical energy dependences .",
    "the mechanism of the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be provides two possibilities for the measurement of the cross section via @xmath3-spectroscopy .",
    "the reaction has a q value of 1.586 mev and at low energies the direct capture can lead to the ground state and first excited state in @xmath2be with the emission of two single @xmath3-lines with energies of e@xmath10+q and e@xmath10+q-429kev . in the latter case the first excited state of @xmath2be decays to the ground state with a 429kev @xmath3-emission .",
    "the detection of these three @xmath3-lines provides one possibility for the cross section measurement ( prompt-@xmath3 or on - line method ) .",
    "the other method for the cross section determination is the measurement of the produced @xmath2be activity . by the measurement of the 478kev @xmath3-radiation following the electron - capture decay of @xmath2be",
    "can be used to determine the total number of fusion reactions ( activation method ) .    until the 1980",
    "s the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be cross section has been measured seven times @xcite with the on - line method and three times with activation @xcite .",
    "the experiments have been carried out in a wide range of energies and using very different experimental techniques .",
    "the lowest energy reached with the on - line method was @xmath11=107kev .",
    "this means that on - line experiments cover the energy relevant for the big - bang nucleosynthesis but are rather far from the solar energy . with activation , however , the lowest measured energy was 897kev @xcite , far above the astrophysical energies .",
    "each data sets have been used to extrapolate the @xmath4 factor to zero energy .",
    "the extrapolations led to an ambiguous result when considering the on - line and activation experiments separately .",
    "activation experiments obtained higher @xmath4 factor values than the on - line measurements resulting in a discrepancy of about 13% ( roughly 2.5@xmath12 deviation ) at zero energy .",
    "for the solution of this discrepancy several possible hidden experimental errors have been proposed .",
    "these include the not precisely known angular distribution of the prompt-@xmath3 radiation , a possible weak monopole transition in the reaction hidden for the on - line experiments , or the presence of parasitic reactions leading to @xmath2be production in the activation case . as more and more precise data became available for both the primordial @xmath2li abundance and solar neutrino fluxes , and as the precision of other reaction rate determinations relevant for bbn and solar hydrogen burning",
    "has been dramatically increased , the need for a more precise @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction rate measurement became pressing .",
    "realizing the need for new , high precision cross section data , b. s. nara singh _ et al .",
    "_ has performed an activation experiment for the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be reaction @xcite .",
    "the cross section was measured at four energy points between 420 and 950 kev .",
    "although these results were the lowest energy activation points ever measured , they were still above the astrophysically relevant energies . moreover , an activation - only experiment  whatever precise it is  is not able to examine the discrepancy between the on - line and activation data .",
    "therefore , an experiment measuring the @xmath0he(@xmath1)@xmath2be @xmath4 factor simultaneously with both techniques is highly needed .",
    "such a measurement should be carried out with high precision and at energies as low as possible in order to have a reliable zero energy extrapolation of the @xmath4 factor .",
    ".[tab : results ] results of the luna activation experiments [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure[fig : all_act_fit ] shows the measured @xmath4 factor data from the four experiments considered above .",
    "the r - matrix calculation by descouvemont _",
    "rescaled to the average of the luna and nara singh _ et al .",
    "_ data is also plotted .",
    "the perfect agreement of the two recent experiments and the systematically higher values obtained in the older measurements is clearly visible",
    ".    the next step should be the inclusion of the on - line cross section data in the @xmath13 analysis .",
    "the high precision luna on - line data are already available @xcite but the analysis of these data with the comparison of other on - line experiments and the activation results is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
