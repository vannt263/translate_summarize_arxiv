    "then    @xmath16    we note that the zeros of @xmath0 are isolated , because each zero is also a fixed point of @xmath17 , an analytic rational function of degree @xmath9 .",
    "this also follows from a result of p. davis  @xcite ( chapter 14 ) concerning the schwarz functions of analytic curves .",
    "( the schwarz function is an analytic function @xmath18 that gives the equation of a curve in the form @xmath19 , _ cf . _",
    "a rational schwarz function implies that the curve is a line or a circle , so the degree must be one .",

    "construct a plane through the center of mass of these point masses , such that the line of sight from the observer to the center of mass is orthogonal to this plane .",
    "this plane is called the lens plane ( or deflector plane ) .",
    "suppose that the lens plane is between the observer and a light source .",
    "( we are assuming that the distance between the point masses is small compared to the distance between the observer and the lens plane , as well as the distance between the lens plane and the light source . ) the plane containing our light source which is parallel to the lens plane is called the source plane . due to the deflection of light by the point masses ,",
    "multiple images of the light source are formed .",
    "this phenomenon is known as gravitational microlensing .",
    "see  @xcite and  @xcite for an introduction to gravitational lensing and @xcite for an introduction to a complex formulation of lensing theory ; also see  @xcite .",
    "gravitational microlensing can be modeled by a lens equation , which defines a mapping from the lens plane to the source plane . to set up a lens equation for our @xmath4-point gravitational lens , the point masses",
    "are projected onto the lens plane .",
    "the projection of the @xmath28-th point mass has a scaled mass of @xmath29 and is located at a scaled coordinate of @xmath30 in the lens plane , where @xmath29 is a positive constant and @xmath30 is a complex constant .",
    "suppose that we have a light source located at a scaled coordinate of @xmath25 in the source plane .",

    "mao , petters , and witt  @xcite have shown there are @xmath143 images when the light source is at the origin and the @xmath144 point masses ( each of mass @xmath145 ) are vertices of a regular polygon centered at the origin .",
    "thus , in contrast to the case where @xmath1 is a polynomial , by moving the poles of @xmath1 into the finite plane , we see that a sharp bound on the number of zeros must be at least @xmath143 .",
    "further , by a clever perturbation argument , rhie  @xcite has shown that the @xmath45 bound is attained and is hence sharp for all @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that the number of lensed images is odd in the case of gravitational lensing by a regular gravitational lens ( @xcite , @xcite ) , given that the position of the source is not a critical value of the lens equation .",
    "( a regular lens has a smooth mass distribution .",
    "a point @xmath25 is a critical value of the lens equation if the jacobian of the lens mapping defined by the lens equation vanishes at any of the points in @xmath146 . )",
    "given that @xmath3 is not always odd , it may seem surprising that @xmath45 lensed images may be possible for an @xmath4-point gravitational lens with @xmath41 and @xmath44 . however , it was shown by petters  @xcite using morse theory , that this is not a problem .",
    "we summarize this result in the following corollary and present an alternate proof .",
    "suppose that we have an @xmath4-point gravitational lens modeled as above with @xmath41 and a light source which is not located at a critical value of the lens equation",
    ". then the number of lensed images must be even when @xmath4 is odd and odd when @xmath4 is even .",
    "_ for this case of the lens equation , we may apply step ( 1 ) in the proof of the ansatz .",

    "note that the above proof is similar to the approach used by n. straumann  @xcite for the case of a regular gravitational lens .",
    "we also note that theorem 1 can be applied to the case of a more general mass distribution than point masses . for a compactly supported mass distribution with the projected mass density @xmath150 in the lens plane",
    ", the lens equation transforms into @xmath151 ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we have the following corollary :    suppose that the projected mass density of a gravitational lens consists of @xmath2 radially symmetric , continuous , compactly supported densities in the lens plane .",
    "if the shear @xmath41 , then the number of lensed images outside the support of the masses can not exceed @xmath3 .",
    "if the shear @xmath43 , then the number of lensed images outside the support of the masses can not exceed @xmath49 .",
    "_ consider the integral term in the lens equation for one of the mass densities .",
    "a calculation shows that this integral evaluated for any @xmath35 outside of the support of this radially symmetric mass density equals @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the center of the mass density and @xmath154 is a finite constant .",
    "hence , for @xmath35 outside of the support of the masses , the lens equation reduces to the lens equation for @xmath4 point masses ( each mass is reduced to a point mass at the sphere s center ) .",
    "corollary 1 can then be applied to count the possible images , giving the upper bounds on images outside the support of the masses as claimed .",
    "@xmath94    if the mass distribution is composed entirely of luminous matter , then the only lensed images that will be visible are those that lie outside of the support of the masses . however , there are mass distributions that are not luminous ( see  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for such mass distributions , it is possible to have lensed images that lie inside the support of the masses .    a question related to bounding the number of zeros of @xmath85 would be to find a bound on the number of zeros of @xmath155 , where both @xmath156 and @xmath50 are rational functions .",
    "it is not clear what condition would be needed for such a function to have a finite number of zeros , much less a bound on the number of distinct zeros ( beyond the obvious bzout theorem s bound when we assume that there are a finite number of zeros ) .",
    "for example , let @xmath157 be a polynomial ( of degree at least two ) and consider @xmath158 . the zeros of this function form a lemniscate in the complex plane .",
    "in other words , @xmath39 has an infinite number of zeros and these zeros are not isolated .",
    "moreover , @xmath159 . if we compare this with the result of wilmshurst  @xcite for the case when @xmath61 is entire : @xmath69 as @xmath160 implies a finite number of zeros , we see that all of the zeros for an entire function will be isolated under wilmshurst s condition for finite valence . thus , @xmath61 having finite poles makes the problem of discreteness of its zero set much more subtle .",
