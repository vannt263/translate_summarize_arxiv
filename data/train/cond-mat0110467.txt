    "over recent years the statistical properties of stochastic non - hermitian operators have come under intense scrutiny  @xcite .",
    "operators of this kind appear in a number of physical applications ranging from random classical dynamics , and statistical physics , to phase breaking and relaxation in quantum dynamics .",
    "for example , a straightforward mapping shows the statistical mechanics of a repulsive polymer chain can be described in terms of the quantum dynamics of a particle subject to a random imaginary scalar potential  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the statistical mechanics of flux lines in a type - ii superconductor pinned by a background of impurities can be described as the quantum evolution of a particle in a disordered environment subject to an imaginary vector potential  @xcite .",
    "finally , the diffusion of a classical particle advected by a random velocity field is described by a linear _ non - hermitian _ operator , the `` passive scalar '' equation  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the dynamics of various classical systems can be expressed in terms of random fokker - planck operators ( for a review see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "non - hermitian operators exhibit several qualitatively new phenomena which discriminate their behaviour from those of their random hermitian counterparts .",
    "firstly , while the eigenvalues of hermitian operators are real , the spectrum of non - hermitian operators is generically complex , bound by some region of support in the complex plane .",
    "the second striking distinction concerns the localization properties of the eigenfunctions .",
    "it is well established that a weak random impurity potential brings about the localization of all eigenstates of a hermitian operator in dimensions of two and below  @xcite . by contrast , a constant imaginary vector potential is sufficient to delocalize states of the disordered system even in one - dimension !",
    "this phenomenon , which was reported and explained by hatano and nelson  @xcite , finds extension to higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "beginning with early work on random matrix ensembles  @xcite , a variety of techniques have been developed to study the statistical properties of stochastic non - hermitian operators  @xcite .",
    "some of the techniques have been based on the random matrix theory  @xcite , while others have involved the development of perturbative schemes , such as the self - consistent born approximation in the diagrammatic analysis ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with adapting a third approach which involves the refinement of field theoretic techniques which have proved to be so useful in the description of random hermitian operators .",
    "recently , attention has been directed towards the study of ` tail states ' which persist at the edge of the spectral support of the non - hermitian system .",
    "indeed , there are already indications  @xcite that an important role can be played by those parts of the spectrum which are populated by rare states .",
    "now , in stochastic _ hermitian _",
    "systems a small tail of states accumulate below the band edge tightly bound to rare or ` optimal fluctuations ' of the random potential  @xcite .",
    "these so - called ` lifshitz tail ' states are typically smooth , node - less , localized functions which inhabit regions where the potential is particularly shallow and smooth .",
    "by contrast , the character of the complex spectrum in non - hermitian operators allows for the existence of tail states that occupy the entire region which bounds the support of the spectrum .",
    "the difference is not incidental : tail states in the non - hermitian system can exhibit features characteristic of the quasi - classical states within the bulk spectrum . to emphasize the point ,",
    "consider the spectrum of , say , a two - dimensional free quantum particle subject to a complex scalar potential which involves both real _ and _ imaginary components , @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "if the imaginary potential @xmath2 is absent , a region of localized tail states accumulate below the band edge ( @xmath3 ) due to optimal configurations of the potential . at energies",
    "@xmath4 greatly in excess of the inverse scattering time @xmath5 , bulk states are only ` weakly localized ' with a localization length @xmath6 greatly in excess of scattering mean - free path @xmath7 and wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "this is the quasi - classical regime where mechanisms of quantum interference strongly affect the spectral and transport properties of the system  @xcite .    on this background ,",
    "let us now suppose that a small imaginary component of the potential is restored .",
    "being non - hermitian , the eigenvalues migrate into the complex plane occupying a finite region of support centered on the real axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : specs ] ) . at the level of the mean - field analysis ( detailed below ) ,",
    "complex eigenvalues are confined to a sharp region of support in the complex plane . however , as with lifshitz states , optimal fluctuations of the random potential(s ) generate states which lie outside the region of support ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : specs ] ) . what is the nature of these states ?",
    "are they localized and , if so , over what length scale ? here , in contrast to the hermitian system , tail states must accommodate fast fluctuations of the wave function at the scale of the wavelength of the hermitian system .    ) , where the potentials @xmath2 and @xmath9 are both drawn from a gaussian @xmath10-correlated random impurity distribution . here",
    "we have included a lattice of @xmath11 @xmath12-points in the momentum space . ]    to our knowledge , the problem of tail states in the non - hermitian system was first considered in a recent work by izyumov and simons  @xcite .",
    "refining an approach developed in refs .",
    "@xcite to explore tail states in hermitian systems , the authors introduced a non - perturbative scheme to investigate states at the edge of the support in non - hermitian systems .",
    "this instanton technique revealed the existence of tail states at the edge which are localized on a length scale greatly in excess of the wavelength  tail states in the non - hermitian system are quasi - classical in nature . building on the work of efetov  @xcite ,",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop a supersymmetric field theory to explore the spatial profile of the states in the tail region , and to determine the complex density of states ( dos ) in the vicinity of the band edge . in doing so",
    ", we will reveal a close correspondence between tail states in the non - hermitian problem and sub - gap states in weakly disordered superconductors .",
    "moreover , constraints within the present scheme reveals the universal character of tail states in the non - hermitian system showing that , after a suitable rescaling , the profile of the dos tail depends only on dimensionality and separation from the support . in particular , in contrast to lifshitz states in the hermitian system , properties of the tail states are universal , independent of the nature of the random distribution .",
    "to illustrate the generality of our approach we will consider two examples which , according to the classification scheme defined below , belong to different fundamental symmetry .",
    "firstly , following our discussion above , we will investigate the properties of tail states in a quantum system involving the propagation of a particle in a random _ scalar _ potential involving both real _ and _ imaginary components  ( [ eq : hamil ] ) .",
    "secondly , we will investigate the nature of tails states in a quantum system where the particle is subject to a random real scalar potential and a random imaginary _ vector _ potential , @xmath13 ^ 2}{2 m } } +    w({{\\mathbf r } } )   \\ ; .",

    ". we will determine the localization properties and profile of the dos revealing an intrinsic universality of the present scheme .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after introducing a general scheme to classify linear non - hermitian operators on the basis of their fundamental symmetries , in section  [ sec : field ] we formulate a statistical field theory to describe the spectral properties of the random imaginary scalar potential hamiltonian . within this approach ,",

    "results from both sections are compared with numerical simulations .",

    "the aim of this section is to prepare a statistical field theory of the weakly disordered non - hermitian system . to be concrete , in the first instance",

    "later , we will see that the field theoretic scheme is easily modified to accommodate the constant vector potential perturbation .",
    "however , before embarking on this program , it is useful to first contrast general properties of complex linear non - hermitian operators with those of their hermitian counterparts .",
    "as well as helping to clarify the idiosyncrasies of the non - hermitian system , we will expose a general scheme in which non - hermitian operators can be classified according to their fundamental symmetries .      a general non - hermitian operator @xmath24 is specified by left and right eigenfunctions , @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the set of complex eigenvalue . although not a generic feature of non - hermitian operators , throughout we will rely on the assumption that the eigenfunctions form a complete basis set .",
    "this is the case if there are no repeated eigenvalues , which will be true for a generic random operator such as those studied here .",
    "furthermore we will take the eigenstates to be orthonormal , @xmath27    now as with hermitian operators , spectral ( and localization ) properties of the non - hermitian hamiltonian can be expressed through the complex green function @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the complex argument . inserting the resolution of identity  , one obtains the spectral decomposition , @xmath30 using the analytical properties of the resolvent , it is straightforward to show that the density of complex eigenvalues @xmath31 is expressible in terms of the complex green function through the identity  : @xmath32 the complex green function @xmath33 is , therefore , a non - analytic function everywhere in the complex @xmath21-plane in which the corresponding eigenvalues density is non - vanishing .",
    "previous studies have shown that techniques based on standard diagrammatic perturbation theory account only for contributions to @xmath34 which are _ analytic _ in @xmath21  @xcite . to account for all contributions , it is convenient to follow the now standard route  @xcite of expressing the green function through an auxiliary hamiltonian which is explicitly hermitian",

    "this ` method of hermitization ' affords a convenient way of classifying the symmetries of a non - hermitian hamiltonian according to the fundamental symmetries of its hermitian counterpart .",
    "the utility of this classification will become manifest presently in the construction of the statistical field theory of the non - hermitian system . as an example , let us consider the hamiltonian involving an imaginary scalar potential  . applied to this problem",
    ", the hermitization procedure leads to the matrix hamiltonian @xmath40 where the pauli matrices @xmath41 act in the @xmath36 sub - space , and @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the matrix structure of @xmath35 bares much in common with the gorkov or bogoliubov - de gennes quasi - particle hamiltonian of a weakly disordered superconductor  @xcite . to foster this analogy",

    "however , within this group , there are four subclasses of higher symmetry : class ci ( the time - reversal invariant superconductor ) where matrices @xmath53 are complex symmetric ; class bdi ( chiral orthogonal ) where the elements of @xmath53 are arbitrary and real ; class cii where @xmath53 has an underlying symplectic structure ; and class diii where @xmath53 is complex antisymmetric . as will be clear from the forthcoming analysis , the statistical field theory describing the non - hermitian spectral properties has soft modes associated with each universality class . from our discussion above",
    ", the imaginary scalar potential is accommodated in the symmetry class ci .",
    "as the second example , let us consider the non - hermitian hamiltonian   involving the random imaginary vector potential .",
    "in this case , the hermitization procedure leads to the matrix hamiltonian @xmath54 as a result , we find that the system belongs to a different class depending on the value of the imaginary component of the energy argument @xmath55 . along the real axis ( i.e. for @xmath56 )",
    "@xmath35 is real and therefore belongs to the symmetry class bdi .",
    "away from the real axis the hamiltonian becomes complex and the symmetry is lowered to class aiii .",
    "later we will discuss the physical manifestations of the discrete symmetries in the two limits .      with this background ,",
    "let us now turn to the construction of a field theory to describe statistical correlations of the non - hermitian model .",
    "motivated by the correspondence outlined above , the analysis will parallel previous investigations of the weakly disordered superconductor  @xcite .",

    ", we can proceed in two ways : firstly , following the discussion above , we can apply the saddle - point analysis seeking a symmetry broken field configuration .",
    "however , in this case , the relative of the bounce solution is now a stationary point of the zero - dimensional potential @xmath297 . alternatively , following efetov  @xcite one can undertake an exact evaluation of the zero - dimensional @xmath23-model .",
    "a pursuit of the second route obtains the exact formula for the complex dos .",
    "the latter can be separated into two contributions @xmath298 , where @xmath299 where @xmath300 with @xmath301 and @xmath302 is the level spacing of the hermitian system .",
    "the presence of the anomalous part @xmath303 attests that a finite fraction of eigenvalues remains real .",
    "otherwise the component @xmath304 describes the distribution of complex eigenvalues and its form is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efeto ] . in the region @xmath305",
    "the dos coincides with the constant mean - field value   for @xmath306 , while outside this interval one has the following asymptotic expansion : @xmath307    with the exact result at hand , let us compare eq",

    "[ fig : poten ] ) . evaluating this minimum",
    ", one obtains @xmath311 from the expression for the dos  , we can conclude that , in the zero - dimensional case , the exponential dependence of the dos coincides with the exact result obtained in ref .",
    "to conclude , we have implemented a field theoretic scheme to explore the structure of the dos close to the edge of the support of two linear non - hermitian operators describing a quantum particle subject to a random imaginary scalar and an imaginary vector potential . in doing so",
    ", we have provided a general scheme for the symmetry classification of non - hermitian operators .",
    "the field theoretic approach is easily generalized to the consideration of higher point spectral correlations of the fields .    in the quasi - classical limit ,",
    "where the real part of the energy is in excess of any other energy scale , the tails are dominated by ` optimal configurations ' of the real random scalar potential .",
    "in contrast to band tail states in semi - conductors , these states are quasi - classical in nature being localized on the length scale @xmath312 .",
    "as such the profile of the dos and their dimension is universal depending on just a few material parameters and independent of the nature of the impurity distribution . in the particular case of the constant imaginary vector potential , we have argued that tail states of the system are prohibited by the delocalization mechanism of hatano and nelson .",
