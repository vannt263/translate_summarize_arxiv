    "in 1974 hawking showed that black holes should continually emit radiation as a natural consequence of quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "hawking radiation is analogous to thermal radiation from a black body and leads to the identification of a classical black hole temperature . in the case of a schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "this temperature is inversely proportional to the black hole mass and therefore increases as the black hole radiates @xcite .",
    "only black holes with mass below @xmath2 have a temperature today greater than that of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "such black holes may have been produced in the early universe with dramatic cosmological consequences .",
    "formation scenarios for primordial black holes ( pbhs ) include the collapse of overdense regions due to primordial inhomogeneities , especially those generated by inflation , a softening of the equation of state or bubble collisions at cosmological phase transitions , and the collapse of oscillating cosmic string loops or domain walls .",
    "the cosmological consequences include modifying the usual picture of cosmological nucleosynthesis , distorting the spectrum of the microwave background radiation , generating a cosmic baryon asymmetry , removing magnetic monopoles , and contributing to the dark matter .",
    "even if pbhs never existed , studying them therefore places important constraints on models of the early universe .",
    "all of these formation scenarios and cosmological consequences have recently been reviewed by carr @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are those pbhs with initial mass @xmath3 which are evaporating at the present epoch , since these should contribute to the observable @xmath4-ray , cosmic ray and neutrino backgrounds ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed the detection of such backgrounds or of individual pbh bursts would be the first confirmation of the fundamental relationship linking black holes , general relativity and thermodynamics ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to date , no such pbh burst or background has been conclusively detected , although d. cline et al .",
    "@xcite have attributed some short - timescale gamma - ray bursts to pbh explosions .",
    "however , observations of the 100 mev gamma - ray background imply that @xmath5 pbhs must have @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 is their present density in units of the critical density .",
    "the 5-year data from the whipple gamma - ray telescope impose the strongest current limit on the pbh explosion rate @xcite . with the standard model of particle physics , this is much weaker than the gamma - ray background limit on @xmath7 if the pbhs cluster smoothly within the galactic halo , but it could be stronger if pbhs were highly clumped . the @xmath7 limits from the galactic cosmic rays are comparable with the gamma - ray background limit but depend on both the pbh clustering and the cosmic ray propagation model @xcite .",
    "black holes of @xmath3 have an initial temperature of about 20 mev . because a black hole will emit all particle species with rest mass less than or of order the black hole temperature , the emission from a 20 mev black hole is sensitive to the threshold for quark and gluon production , @xmath8 . in the standard hawking model @xcite",
    ", the particles directly evaporated from a black hole are those which appear noncomposite compared to the wavelength of the radiated energy ( or equivalently the black hole size ) at a given temperature .",
    "these particles can then decay or form composite particles as the emission streams away from the black hole .",
    "a black hole with a temperature somewhat below @xmath1 should directly emit neutral and charged pions , as well as photons , electrons , positrons , muons , neutrinos and gravitons .",
    "once the energy distribution of the hawking emission significantly extends above @xmath9 , the black hole should directly emit quarks and gluons rather than pions , with the quarks and gluons fragmenting and hadronizing in jets into the astrophysically stable species ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) after emission .",
    "this process is analogous to qcd jet decay in accelerators . by convolving the hawking evaporation with the herwig monte carlo jet code ,",
    "macgibbon and webber found that the particle flux from @xmath17 black holes is predominantly comprised of jet fragmentation products @xcite .",
    "they found that , after decay , the flux peaks at an energy of around 100 mev , roughly independent of the black hole temperature , with the average energy of the final species scaling more weakly than the black hole temperature .",
    "in contrast , prior to decay , the peak and average energies of the direct hawking emission are proportional to the black hole temperature .    in the heckler photosphere scenario , as originally described in refs .",
    "@xcite , the situation is radically different . above a certain black hole temperature ,",
    "the particles are alleged to interact sufficiently after emission to form a quasithermal photosphere at a distance @xmath18 times the schwarzschild radius from the black hole @xcite , where @xmath19 is the fine structure constant . in this model ,",
    "the relevant qed interactions are bremsstrahlung and electron - photon pair production .",
    "the critical temperature above which this happens is estimated to be @xmath20 gev .",
    "when qcd effects are included , a lower transition temperature @xmath21 is derived where @xmath22 is the strong coupling constant : @xmath23 at energy scales around 100 gev but it increases at lower energies and its precise behavior is unknown around @xmath1 .",
    "once the photosphere develops , the high energy emission is reprocessed to lower energies , drastically reducing the flux of high energy particles and significantly weakening the detectability of individual high - temperature black holes . because the best limits on @xmath7 are derived from the present 100 mev emission from a galactic or extragalactic background of pbhs with temperatures well below @xmath24 , the limits on @xmath7 are weakened only slightly by photosphere development @xcite .",
    "however , photosphere development would have considerable implications for experimental efforts to detect ultra - high - energy cosmic rays from the final explosive phases of pbhs in the present epoch @xcite .",
    "indeed , this has led to decreased motivation among groups searching for such signatures .",
    "j. cline , mostoslavsky , and servant @xcite have numerically explored the development of the photosphere in the original heckler model .",
    "they conclude that photosphere formation should set in above a slightly lower value of @xmath24 , weakening the bound on @xmath7 still further and significantly changing the burst spectra .",
    "these authors , however , assume the same initial description of interactions as heckler @xcite , so their work is not an independent derivation or confirmation of the model .",
    "kapusta @xcite and daghigh and kapusta @xcite have also performed calculations related to heckler s model .    in this paper",
    "we will raise a number of problems with the heckler scenario .",
    "these include various geometrical effects , the form of the plasma mass correction , the validity of the perfect fluid assumption and qcd phenomenological considerations",
    ". however , the two most serious omissions in the heckler scenario are as follows : ( i ) two particles must be in causal contact to interact , and this is satisfied only by a small fraction of the emitted relativistic particles when they are sufficiently close to the black hole that they would otherwise have significant interactions ; and ( ii ) in a bremsstrahlung interaction the electron initially forms off - shell and must travel a distance in the black hole frame much greater than @xmath25 before completing each interaction and becoming on - shell .",
    "if it is ` bumped ' by encounters with other particles within @xmath25 of the hole , the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect implies that the particle generally undergoes at most one completed bremsstrahlung interaction as it streams away from the black hole .",
    "thus we conclude that a persistent qed or qcd photosphere can not form around a black hole .",
    "rare interactions could slightly modify the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 signatures of pbhs but not significantly .",
    "other authors , such belyanin , kocharovsky , and kocharovsky @xcite and d. cline et al .",
    "@xcite , have proposed photosphere models which are unrelated to the heckler mechanism .",
    "these models are mainly motivated by an attempt to explain certain short - period gamma - ray bursts . after analyzing the belyanin - kocharovsky - kocharovsky and",
    "d. cline et al .",
    "models , we conclude that particle interactions are also insufficient to form a qed or qcd photosphere in these scenarios .",
    "however , the relevance of pbh explosions at the present epoch should not be ruled out as some other pbh mechanism which has not yet been considered might explain the observed bursts .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the fundamentals of hawking evaporation . in section",
    "iii we outline the original heckler photosphere scenario . in section",
    "iv we analyze this scenario in detail . in section",
    "v we summarize the results of our analysis and their observational implications .",
    "other photosphere models are discussed in section vi .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section vii . except in sections",
    "ii and via , we will use planck units in which @xmath28 .",
    "a kerr - newman black hole with angular velocity @xmath29 and electric potential @xmath30 radiates particles with total energy between @xmath31 at a rate @xcite @xmath32-\\left(-1\\right)^{2s } \\right]^{-1 }    \\label{1}\\ ] ] per degree of particle freedom .",
    "here @xmath33 is the particle spin , @xmath34 is its axial quantum number or angular momentum , @xmath35 is its orbital angular momentum , @xmath36 is its charge and @xmath37 is the dimensionless absorption probability for the emitted species . in general , @xmath37 is a function of @xmath38 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the surface gravity of the black hole @xmath39 , as well as the internal degrees of freedom and rest mass of the emitted particle .",
    "equation   implies that a charged , rotating black hole will preferentially emit particles which have the same sign of charge and spin as the black hole .",
    "the angular momentum of a black hole is emitted several times faster than its mass @xcite .",
    "an electrically charged black hole quickly discharges provided @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the black hole mass @xcite .",
    "thus we will henceforth assume an uncharged , nonrotating schwarzschild black hole , i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the temperature of an uncharged , nonrotating black hole is @xcite @xmath44 at all temperatures , a black hole will radiate the massless elementary particles : @xmath45 neutrinos ( if we ignore neutrino mass ) , @xmath46 photons and @xmath47 gravitons .",
    "massive elementary particles are evaporated in significant numbers once the peak in the energy distribution given by eq .",
    "is of order their particle rest mass . since the exponentially damped tail in eq .",
    "extends to infinite energies , a nonzero contribution from any massive species is always present to some extent .    at high energies ,",
    "the sum over @xmath48 and @xmath35 of the absorption probabilities for both massless and massive species approaches the geometric optics limit @xcite : @xmath49 at low energies , @xmath50 is suppressed for massless @xmath51 and @xmath45 species : @xmath52 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 massless bosons , the @xmath53 fall - off is steeper : @xmath54 the absorption probability for nonrelativistic massive particles is more strongly suppressed at low energies than for massless or relativistic particles . for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the particle rest mass energy , @xmath57 at @xmath58 differs from the corresponding @xmath59 value by up to 45% @xcite .",
    "more importantly , since @xmath38 is the total energy , the spectrum of a massive species must be zero for @xmath60 .",
    "these effects have a strong damping influence on the emission spectrum when the peak energy is close to the particle rest mass threshold .    prior to particle decays ,",
    "the peaks in the flux per particle mode measured at infinity occur at @xcite @xmath61 and the total instantaneous flux emitted by a black hole is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of degrees of freedom ( or modes ) per particle species @xmath64 .",
    "the standard glashow - weinberg - salam model with three generations has 2 modes per @xmath45 neutrino or antineutrino , 4 modes per @xmath45 @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 lepton , 12 modes per @xmath45 quark flavor , 16 modes per @xmath46 gluon , 2 modes per @xmath46 photon , and 2 modes per @xmath47 graviton . with @xmath68 elementary modes for @xmath69 , the total emission rate of particles ( prior to their decays )",
    "is @xmath70    combining eq .   with the particle energy gives the instantaneous mass loss of the black hole",
    "this can be integrated to derive the lifetime of a black hole of initial mass @xmath71 @xcite : @xmath72 the factor @xmath73 depends on the number of emitted species and is normalized to unity when only massless species are emitted . following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can now update the value of @xmath74 , the initial mass of a black hole whose lifetime is the present age of the universe . using the 3-year wilinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) best - fit value for the age of the universe in the lambda cold dark matter ( lcdm ) model , @xmath75 @xcite , we find that @xmath76    to aid our conceptual discussion of interactions between the emitted particles , we note the magnitudes of various physical quantities .",
    "the radius of the black hole is @xmath77 for directly emitted relativistic particles of energy @xmath38 , the reduced de broglie wavelength ( a measure of the effective interaction range for interactions which fall off as some power of @xmath78 ) is @xmath79 in the nonrelativistic case , the factor @xmath80 in eq .",
    "is replaced by the momentum . since the flux per @xmath81 or 1 mode peaks at @xmath82",
    ", we have @xmath83 a typical emitted particle therefore has a wavelength comparable to or somewhat larger than the size of the hole @xmath84 . additionally , the particles can be considered ` evaporated ' at a distance @xmath85 since the outgoing solution of the hawking wave equation here already closely approximates the solution for the particle at infinity @xcite .",
    "if the time between successive emissions from the black hole is less than @xmath86 , or equivalently if the distance travelled by a particle before the hole emits another particle is less than @xmath87 , we would expect interactions between the particles regardless of their species .",
    "equation   gives the average time between successive emissions of elementary particles as @xmath88 so @xmath89 and such interactions are unlikely .",
    "more precisely , oliensis and hill have calculated numerically that more than 99% of the particles emitted over a hole s lifetime satisfy the condition @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "this confirms the appropriateness of using @xmath91 in eq .  .",
    "similarly , from eq .",
    ", once the temperature is above a few times @xmath1 , the energy scale on which the qcd force becomes strong , the time between successive emissions is much shorter than the qcd timescale @xmath92 , and the size of the black hole @xmath84 is much smaller than the associated distance @xmath93 .",
    "thus , for @xmath94 , the hawking evaporation of a colored particle is unaffected by the emission of other colored particles and the particle can be regarded as asymptotically free . on the scales associated with @xmath1 in the black hole rest frame",
    ", the emission of successive colored particles at these temperatures appears as effectively simultaneous production of highly energetic ( @xmath95 ) quarks and gluons at a point .",
    "this is analogous to qcd jet production in @xmath96 annihilation accelerator events .",
    "as the quarks and gluons propagate away from the black hole , they should fragment into further quarks and gluons and finally cluster into colorless hadrons once they have travelled a distance @xmath97 from the black hole . here",
    "@xmath98 represents an ` average ' energy of the jet particles involved in the decay and @xmath99 is an average ` effective ' rest mass energy .    at temperatures above @xmath1 , the observable spectra from the black hole , found by convolving the hawking formula with jet decays ,",
    "are dominated by the qcd decay products .",
    "once the emitted particles have decayed into the astrophysical stable species , the average energy for @xmath100 scales as approximately @xmath101 for @xmath10 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath102 for @xmath11 and @xmath103 , rather than as @xmath104 as given by eq .",
    "the particle flux after decay , @xmath105 , for @xmath100 scales as approximately @xmath106 @xcite , rather than as @xmath104 as implied by eq .  .",

    "if the number density is sufficiently high , the electromagnetic particles could lose energy via two - body bremsstrahlung @xmath111 and pair production @xmath112 as they propagate away from the hole .",
    "each such interaction would increase the number of electromagnetic particles by a factor of @xmath113 .    to calculate the number of scatterings per particle , ref .",

    "since the average momentum exchanged by the virtual photon in the bremsstrahlung interaction is @xmath117 , the heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that the two initial particles must be within @xmath118 of each other to interact significantly . in ref .",
    "@xcite the ` formation ' distance for the final on - shell electron and photon is also assumed to be @xmath118 in the center - of - mass frame of the interaction . in the relativistic limit ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung cross - sections for two incident electrons or two incident positrons or an electron and a positron are the same .",
    "the pair - production cross - section can be derived from the bremsstrahlung cross - section using the substitution law ( see section iv.k ) and has the same functional form in the relativistic limit @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath119 in eq .",
    "is replaced by an effective electron mass @xmath120 which is taken to be the vacuum electron mass @xmath119 augmented by a ` plasma mass ' @xmath121 to account for coulomb screening by the background of other nearby emitted electromagnetic particles .",
    "the electron mass is approximated by the correction applicable for an isotropic thermal plasma @xmath122 which includes the further approximations @xmath123 .",
    "this increases the effective electron mass , resulting in a decreased cross - section , within a distance @xmath124 of the black hole .",
    "however , there is an inaccuracy here in that the emitted particles do not form an isotropic thermal plasma , as pointed out by heckler @xcite and cline , mostoslavsky , and servant @xcite themselves .",

    "heckler first neglects the plasma mass correction and takes the lower limit in integral to be @xmath134 . in this case , the integral becomes @xmath135 which exceeds @xmath136 for @xmath137 the analysis is then extended to include the expression for the plasma mass given by eq .   and the lower limit in integral is taken to be the radius of the black hole .",
    "for @xmath108 small enough that @xmath138 , the number of scatterings is damped by the plasma mass .",
    "the dominant contribution to the integral then comes from the value of @xmath108 at which @xmath139 and this gives @xmath140 which exceeds 1 for @xmath141 on numerically integrating eq .",
    ", heckler finds that @xmath142 when @xmath143 .",

    "the photosphere is found to have inner and outer radii given by @xmath147 approximating this region by a perfect fluid , the average energy of the particles at the outer boundary of the photosphere , in effect the observable average energy of the emitted particles , is estimated to be @xmath148 which is considerably less than the energy @xmath149 expected without photosphere development .",
    "( these values do not include the electrons and photons produced by the decays of other particles radiated by the black hole . )",

    "the lorentz factor @xmath198 of the cm of the two particles relative to the rest frame of the black hole is @xmath199 this is approximately independent of @xmath200 ( and hence @xmath104 ) when @xmath201 .",

    "thus the cm frames for the interactions of particle 1 with the majority of particles streaming out from the black hole are not significantly lorentz - boosted relative to the black hole .",
    "the region for which the interaction frames are significantly lorentz - boosted relative to the black hole is a cone of angle @xmath210 around the direction of particle 1 .    in general ,",

    "the special relativistic equations for relative velocity then give @xmath217 and @xmath218 for @xmath219 .",
    "again @xmath220 is approximately independent of @xmath200 and @xmath221 ( and thus @xmath104 ) unless @xmath197 is extremely close to zero .",
    "if we assume @xmath222 , without loss of generality , and consider @xmath223 , corresponding to @xmath224 ( this more than adequately covers the majority of the hawking distribution around @xmath91 ) , we have @xmath225 when @xmath226 and @xmath227 when @xmath228 .",
    "similarly if @xmath229 , then @xmath225 when @xmath230 and @xmath227 when @xmath231 .",
    "hence we conclude that taking the cm frame of each interaction to be the black hole rest frame , as heckler does , is a valid approximation for the interactions of any given particle with most other particles . to within a factor of @xmath232 ,",
    "using @xmath162 in the black hole frame to describe the interactions of the particle is correct , except for an exclusion cone of angle @xmath233 radians around the direction of the particle s velocity for which the interactions are negligible because @xmath234 .",
    "however , as we shall see below , this exclusion cone has important consequences which hinder the development of the photosphere .",
    "once the particle has traveled a distance @xmath235 from the black hole , the transverse distance between the particle and the edge of its exclusion cone is @xmath236 because @xmath237 is a transverse distance , @xmath237 is the same in the particle and black hole frames .",
    "thus once the particle has traveled a distance @xmath238 from the black hole , the distance to the nearest particle with which it could then interact is of order @xmath134 , provided the emitted particles are still traveling mainly radially . because @xmath162 dictates that two particles must be within @xmath118 of each other to interact via bremsstrahlung , few interactions can occur after the particles have propagated this distance",
    ". the relevant interactions for initiating photosphere formation can only be those which occur within @xmath239 of the black hole .",
    "this point is not included in the original heckler model .",
    "as we shall demonstrate in section iv.g , the electron coming out of a bremsstrahlung interaction is still off - shell at @xmath239 .",
    "also @xmath162 is truncated by the causality constraint and may be damped by off - shell ( lpm - type ) interactions , as we discuss in sections iv.f and iv.h .",
    "these effects significantly decrease the capacity for photosphere formation .      we have assumed in the exclusion cone argument that the emitted particles move out radially from the black hole",
    "we now justify this . were they to random walk out , an individual particle would have to undergo @xmath240 scatterings to deviate by an angle @xmath233 from the radial direction , where @xmath168 is given by eq .  .",
    "if @xmath241 gev , @xmath242 scatterings are required for the particle to scatter outside the exclusion cone .",
    "thus even if a photosphere can develop , particles will deviate little from the radial direction before and after photosphere formation .",
    "( as discussed in section iv.l , this is incorrectly treated in the numerical work of cline , mostoslavsky , and servant @xcite . ) therefore the constraint of section iv.d set by the transverse distance to the edge of the exclusion cone will also apply after the onset of scattering .",
    "this confirms that the only relevant interactions can be those which occur within @xmath239 of the hole .    additionally , if we consider the possible deviation from the radial direction due to the finite size of the black hole , eq .",
    "implies that @xmath243 only when @xmath244 .",
    "this is approximately the radius at which the hawking emitted particle first appears and , for @xmath107 , represents a tiny portion of the region within @xmath239 of the black hole .",
    "hence the effect of black hole size on the propagation direction should also be negligible .",
    "we now calculate the number of interactions @xmath125 each particle undergoes . the definition of the mean - free - path used in the heckler model and given by eq .",

    "[ f3 ] @xcite .",
    "this is not geometrically analogous to the black hole situation for three reasons .",
    "first , the particles are moving radially outward in a spherical distribution from the black hole .",
    "second , the number density @xmath245 varies with the distance of the moving particles from the black hole .",
    "that is , if we consider particle 1 interacting with an element of the flux around particle 2 , @xmath246 does not remain constant as particles 1 and 2 travel outwards .",
    "third , implicit in eq .",
    "is the assumption that the interacting particles have an infinite past and future , which is not the case for black hole emission . consider particle 1 at radial position @xmath247 and particle 2 at @xmath248 with @xmath249 .",
    "particle 2 was emitted by the black hole at a time @xmath250 later than particle 1 .",
    "the hawking derivation of eq .",
    "utilizes the solutions at infinity but does not tell us how a particle is evaporated : either the particle did not exist or it was hidden by the event horizon before emission . in either interpretation , the particle prior to its emission can not interact with particles outside the event horizon .",
    "the interaction lifetime of the particle is therefore truncated . because @xmath125 in eqs .   and is dominated by the interactions of particle 1 with the short - lived , high density particles close to the black hole",
    ", this truncated lifetime should have a significant effect on the heckler scenario .",
    "an important consequence of the truncated lifetime is its implication for causality . from the classical point of view , i.e. ignoring temporarily the quantum smearing of particle space - time position and energy - momentum due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle and the quantum nature of interactions , two particles can interact only if they are causally connected or , equivalently , if a light signal can be transmitted between them .",
    "classically each particle is point - like and emitted by the black hole at a precise time . without loss of generality , let us assume particle 1 , emitted at time @xmath251 in the black hole rest frame , is the scattering particle in the bremsstrahlung interaction and particle 2 , emitted at @xmath252 , is the scattered particle .",
    "the time difference @xmath253 may be positive or negative .",
    "the most appropriate frame for analyzing the causality constraint is the frame of the scattering particle because the coulomb field of the scattering particle has an undistorted @xmath254 distribution in its own frame .",
    "let us consider a light signal which travels a distance @xmath255 from the scattering particle in the scattering particle s frame and reaches the scattered particle .",
    "the form of the invariant @xmath162 , eq .  , implies that , if the particle histories were not truncated , the probability for the scattered particle to undergo a bremsstrahlung event would be @xmath256 if @xmath257 , but negligible if @xmath258 .",
    "( the truncation of the particle histories will further suppress the probability within @xmath257 @xcite . )",
    "if @xmath259 and particle 1 emits a light signal which reaches particle 2 just as particle 2 is emitted by the black hole , one can readily calculate @xcite that @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the velocity of the particles in the black hole frame .",
    "if , alternatively , @xmath262 and particle 1 , as soon as it is evaporated by the black hole , emits a light signal which then reaches particle 2 , a slightly longer calculation @xcite shows that @xmath263{\\rm \\ ; } \\left|\\delta t\\right|>\\gamma v\\left|\\delta t\\right|   \\label{52}\\ ] ] where @xmath197 is the angle between the particles in the black hole frame .",
    "thus in either case , for the @xmath264 constraint to be met , the difference in the emission times must be @xmath265 for relativistic particles .",
    "however , from section ii ,",
    "the average time between successive emissions of electrons and positrons directly evaporated by the black hole is @xmath266 using @xmath267 , we see that @xmath268 for all @xmath194 .",
    "thus the classical causality condition is only satisfied by a negligible fraction of the emitted particles when @xmath194 .",
    "the same conclusion applies for qcd particles when @xmath269 .",
    "because the emission of a given species is damped near its rest mass threshold @xcite , so increasing @xmath270 , the classical causality condition is unlikely to be satisfied even near particle rest mass thresholds .",
    "( also recall that @xmath162 decreases faster with decreasing @xmath38 in the non - relativistic limit . ) at any @xmath104 , if a photosphere is to form , we additionally require the causality constraint to be met within a sphere of radius @xmath238 around the black hole .",
    "this only further tightens the @xmath253 constraint .",
    "quantum mechanical effects relax the above classical constraint only slightly . by the heisenberg uncertainty principle ,",
    "the emission of each electron from the black hole is smeared out over a time @xmath271 , leading to it having a spatial spread in the direction of emission of @xmath272 .",
    "thus when the electron is a distance @xmath108 from the black hole , we can visualize it quantum mechanically as an eggshell segment of thickness @xmath273 , radial curvature @xmath108 and tangential width growing to @xmath134 , whose probability of overlapping another emitted electron is essentially given by the classical constraint above .",
    "additionally , the virtual photon exchanged between the two bremsstrahlung - interacting electrons , which typically transfers 3-momentum @xmath274 and negligible energy and has a nonzero mass ( @xmath275 ) , can not be localized within a length less than @xmath276",
    ". it can extend over a spacelike interval but spacelike intervals in the propagator are strongly suppressed .",
    "however , the wave speed at which the field of one electron propagates to the other electron in the dirac equation remains @xmath131 .",
    "therefore the above classical causality constraint essentially always applies to the quantum interaction .",
    "equation   then must be replaced with an expression which more accurately describes the geometry of the interaction and accounts for the shortened histories of the interacting particles . as we discuss in ref .",
    "@xcite , the causality constraint and truncated histories also decrease the momentum transferred in each interaction , decreasing the effective @xmath162 well below the already small @xmath144 cross - section of eq .  .",
    "even at high @xmath104 , the average number of interactions per particle is bounded by @xmath277 and can not reach @xmath142 . if an emitted particle does scatter once , we now show that the distance to complete that first scattering is such that subsequent complete scatterings by the particle within @xmath239 of the black hole are not possible .",
    "thus it is improbable for particles to experience more than one bremsstrahlung interaction .",
    "this by itself is sufficient to prevent qed photosphere formation .      in the original heckler model",
    "the distance needed for the completion of a bremsstrahlung interaction , i.e. the distance required for the formation of the final on - shell electron , is assumed to be @xmath278 in the cm frame of the interaction .",
    "this is not correct and must be replaced by the much larger distance @xmath279 , as we can see in two ways .    first , the 4-momentum of the off - shell electron is @xmath280 where @xmath281 and @xmath282 are the 4-momenta of the final on - shell electron and photon , respectively ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . from eqs .   and , the average energies of the final electron and photon are @xmath283 and the average angle between them is @xmath284 , so we have @xmath285 .",
    "thus the average lifetime of the off - shell electron in its own frame is @xmath118 , which corresponds to @xmath0 in the cm frame of the interaction .",
    "second , following ref .",
    "@xcite , consider the final electron and photon as they are being created . because they are created with a small separation angle , their wave packets will initially overlap for some distance as they propagate .",
    "this distance is the formation distance .",
    "the transverse momentum components of the final electron and photon relative to the momentum of the initial electron @xmath286 are both @xmath287 . by the heisenberg uncertainty principle these transverse momenta",
    "can be resolved only when the transverse spatial separation is at least @xmath288 .",
    "since the opening angle between them is @xmath168 , this occurs after they have traveled a radial distance @xmath289 in the cm frame of the interaction .",
    "thus again the formation distance must be @xmath279 .",
    "as we have already noted , the consequence of this is that the only relevant interactions for photosphere creation can be those which occur within @xmath238 of the black hole .",
    "certainly @xmath290 for @xmath107 and so , on completion of the first bremsstrahlung interaction , the products can no longer significantly interact with other particles . in the extremely rare event that an electron undergoes more than one scattering within @xmath239 of the black hole , the subsequent scattering occurs when the electron is off - shell , not on - shell .      in the general",
    "setting , if an off - shell particle undergoes multiple scattering over the distance @xmath291 ( the formation length of the photon and final electron in the bremsstrahlung interaction ) , landau , pomeranchuk and migdal have shown that the bremsstrahlung cross - section is decreased by a numerical factor of up to @xmath232 ( see @xcite ; for a recent review see ref .",
    "this is known as the lpm effect and has been confirmed experimentally , at least in the soft photon regime @xcite .",
    "( the effect is greatest in this regime because @xmath291 increases as @xmath114 decreases @xcite . )",

    "recent theoretical treatments include elastic ( coulomb ) and inelastic ( bremsstrahlung ) scatterings of the off - shell electron @xcite .    applying the lpm effect to the black hole scenario",
    ", we would expect multiple scatterings of the off - shell electron to decrease the effective bremsstrahlung cross - section . since the off - shell electron requires a distance @xmath291 to decay into the final on - shell electron and photon , even if @xmath292 within @xmath238 , each particle generally undergoes at most one complete on - shell scattering as it streams away from the hole .",
    "recall that the probability of undergoing even one complete scattering is significantly damped by the causality constraint at @xmath107 . incorporating the precise effect in the black hole scenario",
    "requires calculating the lpm effect from first principles because the black hole scenario differs from other lpm scenarios in at least three ways : ( i ) the black hole off - shell interactions are bremsstrahlung ( not just coulomb scatterings ) with average momentum transfer similar to that of the initial bremsstrahlung interaction ; ( ii ) the off - shell interactions and the initial interaction occur essentially simultaneously , not sequentially , and their range is greater than the distance between each off - shell interaction ; and ( iii ) the non - uniform number density , truncated particle histories and energy distributions of the emitted particles are specific to the black hole case .    proceeding qualitatively , we expect the following outcomes for black hole qed interactions . for bremsstrahlung , we have @xmath293 , so multiple scatterings , if they occur , can perturb only a small segment of the complete interaction of a typical particle . because @xmath294 , any scatterings affect the particle essentially simultaneously within a distance @xmath295 of the black hole .",
    "( the actual region will be smaller than @xmath239 because of the causality constraint . )",
    "therefore the particle can be thought of as interacting with a region within @xmath295 as a whole .",
    "this corresponds to the single radiator or thin target lpm limit @xcite .",
    "the probability for interaction in this limit is given by the total scattering angle within the @xmath295 region @xcite .",
    "if we approximate this angle by that appropriate for a random walk of successive scatterings , @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the number of scatterings the particle undergoes within @xmath295 of the black hole , then @xmath298 for @xmath299 . from the numerical simulations of haug @xcite , @xmath300 falls off roughly exponentially at angles above @xmath168 and the momentum transfer is increased , although the energies of the final photon and electron stay of order @xmath38 .",
    "hence @xmath301 and the modified cross - section is always less than that for the interaction without off - shell scattering .",
    "additionally , if the bremsstrahlung photon pair - creates before it is completely formed , @xmath162 is further suppressed @xcite .",
    "thus the net effect of multiple off - shell qed scatterings is to decrease the probability of any particle producing a bremsstrahlung photon .",
    "even if @xmath292 , each particle requires a distance @xmath294 to complete the interaction and so is unlikely to undergo more than one completed bremsstrahlung interaction as it streams away from the black hole .",
    "because each particle rarely undergoes more than one completed interaction , the number density around the black hole can increase by only a small fraction ( at most 50% ) even if @xmath292 .",
    "hence we conclude that a qed photosphere will not develop .      in the original heckler model",
    ", it was argued that on scales less than @xmath238 the qed bremsstrahlung cross - section should be suppressed by coulomb scattering off other electrons around the black hole .",
    "( however , heckler did not include the off - shell bremsstrahlung interactions discussed above . ) to account for the coulomb scattering , refs .",
    "@xcite took the simplified approach of defining the effective electron mass @xmath119 to include the fermion self - energy for a finite temperature bath . in the expression for @xmath162",
    ", @xmath119 was augmented in the interaction rest frame by the thermal plasma mass given by eq .  , which describes the screening of the electron by other emitted electrons .",
    "as heckler pointed out , the hawking emission is not a true plasma .",
    "because the emitted particles flow isotropically out of the point - like black hole , the particle distribution can not be transformed into a frame in which the particles exhibit a maxwell - boltzmann momentum distribution .    as we have seen , the causality constraint prevents emitted electrons interacting significantly within @xmath238 of the black hole .",
    "this should apply to coulomb scattering as well as bremsstrahlung interactions .",
    "also , since each electron requires a distance @xmath294 to complete a bremsstrahlung interaction , @xmath245 can not increase substantially within @xmath239 of the black hole due to interactions .",
    "thus plasma mass considerations should be irrelevant within @xmath238 for @xmath107 .",
    "although the heckler photosphere scenario relies on the @xmath302 two - body bremsstrahlung interaction between two charged particles emitted by the black hole , the emitted particles may experience other qed bremsstrahlung processes which we investigate in detail in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "first , there should be the @xmath303 inner bremsstrahlung generated by the charged particle as it escapes the black hole and , from the point of view of a distant observer , has its velocity changed from being essentially zero at the black hole to its asymptotic value .",
    "this inner bremsstrahlung emission will contribute about 10% of the total photon power from an @xmath304 black hole and has an approximately energy - independent power spectrum which dominates over the directly emitted hawking photons at low energies @xcite .",
    "secondly , there should be the @xmath305 bremsstrahlung emission from the scattering of the charged emitted particles by the stochastic electromagnetic field of the black hole , and another @xmath302 contribution from the scattering of the inner bremsstrahlung photon off an ambient charged particle . in fact , since the inner bremsstrahlung dominates all bremsstrahlung processes , the other bremsstrahlung processes can be simply regarded as small @xmath303 and @xmath305 corrections to the inner bremsstrahlung .",
    "the total bremsstrahlung emission is then essentially determined by the asymptotic momentum distribution of the charged particles , which to lowest order in @xmath306 is determined by the hawking emission formula eq .   and to higher orders",
    "is modified slightly by the interactions between the emitted charged particles . in all cases , however , the outgoing photon and electron from any bremsstrahlung interaction require a formation distance @xmath307 . thus none of these bremsstrahlung interactions can produce a qed photosphere around a @xmath107 black hole .",
    "so far , we have discussed qed bremsstrahlung interactions but the above considerations also apply to qed pair production @xmath112 . the pair - production cross - section is obtained from @xmath162 by rotating the feynman diagrams to depict an incident photon rather than an outgoing photon and using the substitution rules @xcite . in the relativistic limit",
    ", @xmath308 has the same form as @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the outgoing @xmath26 and @xmath27 is strongly peaked in the direction of the initial photon and each carries on average approximately half the initial photon energy @xcite .",
    "the formation length of the @xmath309 pair is also @xmath310 when @xmath311 @xcite . as before",
    ", any multiple off - shell scattering will suppress @xmath308 within the distance @xmath291 when @xmath107 .",
    "thus each particle can undergo at most one complete pair - production event as it streams away from the black hole and the probability of that interaction is strongly suppressed by the causality constraint . again",

    "the above discussion also applies to qcd gluon - bremsstrahlung and qcd pair - production interactions of the emitted particles .",
    "( note here we are referring to the qcd interactions between particles in different qcd jets , not between particles in the same qcd jet .",

    "this leads to eq .   in the relativistic case , neglecting color factors of @xmath232 .",
    "the average time between qcd particle emissions by the black hole is @xmath312 when @xmath94 .",
    "the qcd formation scale @xmath313 is also the scale at which the hawking emission hadronizes . applying the same arguments as above , when @xmath94",
    ", the causality constraint implies that the emitted qcd particles have little chance of interacting within @xmath314 of the black hole and any particles that do interact can undergo at most one complete qcd bremsstrahlung interaction within @xmath315 .",
    "thus no qcd photosphere ( also known as a chromosphere ) should form when @xmath94 . because of the time separation between subsequent qcd jets and the lpm effect , nor should a photosphere form from interaction of the hadronization products which appear at @xmath316 .",
    "qcd phenomenology and experiments also strongly argue against a qcd photosphere developing when @xmath104 ( or more specifically the peak energy of the directly emitted flux ) passes through values that are roughly @xmath1 . because the heckler estimate , @xmath317 , is close enough to @xmath1 that high energy formulae may be inappropriate",
    ", the question arises of whether a qcd photosphere could form from _ non - relativistic _ effects at these temperatures .",
    "if the emission were non - relativistic , the causality constraint would be weakened . also at low energies the effective @xmath22",
    "is observed to increase from its high energy limit , @xmath318 where @xmath319 is the number of relevant quark species , and may approach @xmath320 as @xmath321 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear whether , even if multiple scatterings were to occur around @xmath322 , they would affect the observable spectra , because the hawking emission is strongly damped and the multiplicity per qcd jet is very low around the @xmath1 threshold @xcite .",
    "however , we deduce from both the qcd phenomenology and experimental perspectives that when the black hole begins to emit asymptotically free quarks , these quarks are relativistic",
    ". therefore no qcd photosphere should develop around @xmath322 .    the emission picture which is consistent with qcd phenomenology and threshold accelerator experiments is as follows .",
    "when @xmath104 ( or more precisely @xmath323 for @xmath51 ) is about the pion rest mass ( @xmath324 and @xmath325 ) , the black hole should start emitting pions directly , with the grey - body factors and degrees of freedom appropriate for massive @xmath51 particles modified by the finite - size structure of the pion .",
    "once the scale of the black hole emitting region becomes small compared with the length below which the constituent ( valence ) @xmath326 and @xmath235 quarks in the pions become asymptotically free , the black hole should begin emitting the quarks individually .",
    "these quarks then hadronize into pions on the proper distance scale @xmath327 in the frame of the emitted quark .",
    "the energy at which this happens is sufficiently above the pion rest mass that the pion is relativistic .",
    "hence the pion s constituent quarks should also be regarded as relativistic .",
    "furthermore , during the asymptotic freedom regime before the quark hadronizes , the quark masses which are used in the qcd lagrangian are the much lighter quark current masses , not the quark constituent masses .",
    "( the quark current masses are @xmath328 , @xmath329 and @xmath330 , whereas the quark constituent masses are @xmath331 and @xmath332 . for the heavy @xmath131 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 quarks ,",
    "the current masses are approximately equal to the constituent masses and lie above @xmath335 @xcite .",

    "thus the quarks are ultra - relativistic during their asymptotic freedom phase and then gain larger effective masses , but still remain relativistic , when they hadronize .    the hadronization process itself at these energies",
    "also can not produce a significant increase in the number of final particle states .",
    "what the quarks hadronize into is dictated by energy and quantum conservation laws .",
    "hence , around @xmath322 , the quarks can hadronize only into pions ( or the few light meson states which decay into pions or mimic @xmath336 decay into photons ) and the multiplicity of the final pions per initial hawking emitted quark must be very low ( one or two pions per initial quark ) @xcite .",
    "emission of @xmath309 or photons by these quarks or pions is covered by our earlier analysis of qed interactions and so is negligible , as are any weak interactions .",
    "gluon bremsstrahlung by quarks at these energies is also inconsequential .",
    "the gluon has to obey the qcd confinement ( no - free - color ) and quantum conservation rules .",
    "thus a gluon must have an energy of about @xmath1 or greater to produce free final state particles , the lowest energy option being a pion pair . because the total momentum in the frame defined by the black hole and the hawking emitted quark must be conserved and there are no available very light final states for the gluon or the quark , an asymptotically free hawking emitted quark of energy @xmath337",

    "this stretching and breaking sequence continues until the energy of the lead quark has been expended producing new @xmath343 pairs .",
    "the quarks and antiquarks created from the flux - tube match up to hadronize into bound color - neutral states .",
    "the whole process is completed over the distance scale @xmath345 in the black hole frame , where @xmath38 is the energy of the initial quark .",

    "that the asymptotically free quarks are relativistic , rather than non - relativistic , when first emitted by the black hole around @xmath322 can additionally be seen from the thermodynamical ` detailed balance ' derivation of the hawking flux .",
    "when a black hole is in quasithermal equilibrium at a given instant with a surrounding thermal bath of the same temperature , the absorption rate of a given species equals its emission rate .",
    "if a pion incident upon a black hole has total energy insufficient for the pion to break up into subparticles with one subparticle going down the hole and one escaping , detailed balance gives the hawking emission rate of direct outgoing pions from the capture cross - section of the incoming pions .",
    "when the pion size is comparable to the cross - section for a point - like scalar particle of the same mass and energy as the pion , the pion capture cross - section should be similar to that of the corresponding point - like scalar particle .",
    "( this cross - section should also apply when the black hole itself is much smaller than the pion if the pion is moving sufficiently slowly that the capture cross - section is much larger than the hole itself . in this case , once the pion falls to a distance from the hole comparable to its size , it will be nearly inevitable that part of the pion will fall into the hole , with the rest having insufficient energy to escape even though the pion may initially appear to have too large an intrinsic size to be captured by the smaller hole . )",
    "if the black hole size is significantly smaller than the size of the pion and the incoming pion is moving relativistically ( that is , its kinetic energy is significantly greater than its rest mass ) , the black hole can capture an individual constituent quark of the pion , with the other constituent escaping capture or being captured after a significant time interval .",
    "this inelastic scattering of the pion by the black hole could also lead to the production of other particles , depending on the available energy .",
    "one could visualize the capture process as the glue string between the captured quark and the constituent antiquark of the original pion breaking in two , with a new antiquark forming on the end of the string attached to the quark that fell into the hole and a new quark forming at the end of the string attached to the uncaptured antiquark .",
    "the new antiquark attached to the glue string going into the hole could be captured by the hole , while the new quark attached to the external glue string could escape along with the original antiquark . for incident pions of high enough energy , more complicated inelastic processes could lead to greater",

    "it is clear that the qcd production around a @xmath322 black hole is not analogous to the creation of quark - gluon plasma at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) ( for a recent review of rhic results , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at rhic",
    "the collision of heavy @xmath347 nuclei at center - of - mass energies of @xmath348 and @xmath349 per nucleon generates a strongly coupled , high entropy quark - gluon plasma which rapidly achieves a thermal spectrum and then expands isentropically until the particles hadronize and decouple by a time @xmath350 .",
    "presently it is not known whether the plasma achieves its thermal spectrum of states by interactions or is initially created with that distribution of states @xcite . at the moment of collision , the overlapping @xmath351 nuclei are highly lorentz - contracted in the center - of - momentum frame , implying an overlap time of @xmath352 and an initial thermalized energy density of about @xmath353 .",
    "the initial energy density estimate varies with the interpretative model but in all cases is far greater than the @xmath354 threshold for quark - gluon plasma formation or the density within a nucleon @xmath355 , and remains so for up to @xmath356 .",
    "the number of charged particles arriving at the detectors ( about @xmath357 ) indicates that approximately @xmath358 high energy particles are created per initial nucleon but the dependence of the charged particle multiplicity on the available energy per colliding nucleon still matches that seen in @xmath359 and @xmath360 accelerator collisions @xcite .",
    "the hadronic multiplicities are determined by the nonzero baryonic chemical potential ( baryon / anti - baryon asymmetry ) of the initial nuclei .",
    "notably , a reduction of a factor of about @xmath361 in the number of high transverse momentum hadrons is observed .",
    "this phenomenon is known as jet - quenching , although the high transverse momentum jets are not truly quenched but spread over a wider angle with lower average energy per particle .",
    "the hadronic energy loss implies significant qcd interaction with the ambient plasma , but photons are observed to travel through the plasma unimpeded .",
    "the jet - quenching can be modeled by assuming that the collision initially creates a gluon number distribution of @xmath362 , where @xmath363 is the rapidity defined by @xmath364 for a particle of energy @xmath365 and transverse momentum @xmath366 .",
    "( integrating over @xmath367 , this gives the number of gluons per nucleon to be of order @xmath368 ) .",
    "application of the heisenberg uncertainty principle indicates that the nuclei are gluon - saturated on the scale of the collision even before impact : that is , at 200 gev per nucleon the two gold nuclei see each other as dense objects , not ensembles of distinct partons , because the atomic number ( parton density ) and transverse momenta are such that the partons overlap considerably in the transverse plane @xcite .",
    "all of the above effects attributable to a strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma are experimentally confirmed to be suppressed at lower collision energies and in deuteron - gold collisions @xcite .    in the @xmath322 black hole case ,",
    "however , in contrast to rhic , the conditions for the simultaneous production of an ultra - high density of qcd particles are not met .",
    "a @xmath322 black hole emits particles by the hawking process sequentially and relativistically with significant time separation between each particle emission .",
    "thus , as we have seen in section iv.f , negligibly few of the hawking emitted quarks are in sufficient causal contact to interact with each other within @xmath327 of the black hole .",
    "furthermore , as discussed above , conservation of energy severely limits the number of final states that can be created per initial quark around @xmath322 . in the black hole case ,",
    "only an energy @xmath337 is available per hawking emitted quark , in contrast to the @xmath349 per nucleon available at rhic .",
    "( additional differences include the facts that the corresponding baryonic chemical potential is @xmath369 , because the black hole emits equal numbers of quarks and antiquarks , and that the black hole particles are not initially gluon - saturated . ) hence , as given by eqs .",
    " , the greatest achievable density around a @xmath322 black hole is well below @xmath354 .",
    "the closest experimental analogy to the @xmath322 black hole situation is the generation of pions and qcd jets in @xmath359 accelerator collisions and in hadronic collisions at much lower center - of - mass energies per nucleon .    in summary",
    "we conclude that the time separation between emissions and the limited average energy available per hawking emitted particle prevent the formation of a qcd photosphere around a @xmath322 black hole , and the causality and @xmath315 constraints prevent qcd photosphere formation at @xmath94 .",
    "we also note that the above description of the qcd threshold emission processes should lead to more precise numerical modeling of the astrophysical particle spectra produced by hawking radiation around the @xmath1 threshold than has previously been published .",
    "the original heckler scenario was numerically modelled by j. cline , mostoslavsky , and servant @xcite , who simulated photosphere development using the test particle method to solve the boltzmann equation for propagation of plasma particles undergoing collisions @xcite .",
    "they found that qed photosphere production set in at @xmath370 ( comparable to heckler s value of @xmath371 ) but extended over a much smaller region : it started at @xmath372 ( compared to heckler s @xmath373 ) and ended at @xmath374 where the trajectories of particles within the interaction range rapidly become parallel , as we saw in section iv.d .",
    "for @xmath375 , their photosphere region was extended by compton scattering effects . however , cline , mostoslavsky , and servant use @xmath376 , whereas the correct relativistic klein - nishina cross - section @xcite for a photon of energy @xmath38 compton scattering off an electron of energy @xmath38 in the black hole rest frame is @xmath377 .",
    "they also found that the fluid description is of questionable validity and that it led to an average photon energy at the outer photosphere edge which differed from heckler s value , even decreasing as @xmath104 increases .",
    "the differences are more marked in the qcd case , partly because of the form of the qcd plasma mass correction used by heckler .",
    "they found that a qcd photosphere forms for @xmath378 and extends to @xmath379 .",
    "the cline , mostoslavsky , and servant work is elucidating but , because it takes the same approach as ref .",
    "@xcite , all of the points we have made above apply to it .",
    "most importantly , the authors neglect the causality and @xmath291 constraints which limit each particle to at most one on - shell bremsstrahlung interaction within @xmath374 or @xmath379 and make even that highly unlikely .",
    "an additional problem is that they generate the bremsstrahlung photons with random energy @xmath380 and random angle @xmath381 .",
    "we have seen that the true photon angle is very small @xmath382 and deviates little from the direction of the initial electron . randomizing",
    "the angle would exaggerate photosphere development , and this may explain why cline , mostoslavsky , and servant find @xmath24 to be lower than heckler s original analytic estimate .",
    "their numerical method should therefore be modified to include all of our previous points in section iv and could be employed to investigate the consequences of the rare bremsstrahlung interactions .",
    "kapusta @xcite and daghigh and kapusta @xcite have analytically and numerically investigated the hydrodynamic expansion of matter around a black hole in the original heckler photosphere formation scenario . in their treatment , the @xmath383 emission is assumed to be a quasi - stationary shell of plasma expanding relativistically away from the hole .",
    "the plasma is kept in local thermal equilibrium by the qed and qcd bremsstrahlung and pair - production interactions of the original heckler model .",
    "` local thermal equilibrium ' in this context is taken to mean that the mean - free - path , or thermalizing scale , of the plasma particles is less than the scale over which the plasma temperature is changing @xcite .",
    "they find that the quasi - stationary photosphere shell extends out to @xmath384 .",
    "the expected observable photon signal is then calculated from the luminosity of the photosphere surface .",
    "the results of daghigh and kapusta are not supported by our analysis . as we have seen in section iv",
    ", the interactions within @xmath295 of the black hole can not significantly increase the number density @xmath245 , as required for photosphere formation .",
    "their approach also neglects the causality and @xmath291 constraints within @xmath295 .",
    "once a particle reaches @xmath239 , we have shown that the geometry is such that it has little probability of interacting with other emitted particles .",
    "thus , contrary to the claim of daghigh and kapusta , there should be no change in the particle energy after the particle reaches @xmath385 and no persistent qed or qcd photosphere or locally thermalized plasma should develop .",
    "in section iv we have shown that a heckler qed photosphere will not form around a hawking black hole .",
    "similar arguments and additional qcd phenomenological considerations prevent a qcd photosphere developing . interactions which occur within @xmath239 of the black hole determine whether a heckler photosphere can arise .",
    "these interactions are extremely rare and any multiple scatterings involve off - shell particles .",
    "in contrast , the original heckler model postulated that each particle on average undergoes successive on - shell bremsstrahlung interactions out to a much greater radius .",
    "this led to an increase in the expected flux at low energies and a steepening of the spectra at high energies . including the off - shell scatterings",
    ", however , suppresses the effective bremsstrahlung cross - section and permits at most one completed bremsstrahlung interaction per particle .",
    "this one net interaction can only slightly modify the observable emission spectra , and not significantly as would a photosphere .",
    "our remarks apply equally to pair production . also of crucial importance to determining",
    "the full spectra is understanding the emission processes around @xmath322 .",
    "if each emitted particle produces at most one bremsstrahlung particle or undergoes pair - production once as it streams away from the black hole , there will be little effect on the detectability of an individual black hole or a background of black holes .",
    "the number of relativistically emitted particles of the relevant species in the relevant part of the spectra could be increased by at most a factor of @xmath113 and the average energy decreased by at most @xmath386 .",
    "furthermore , given the low likelihood of even one net interaction , the causality constraint discussed in section iv.f implies that any change to the spectra should be several orders of magnitude weaker than this . as we show in ref .",
    "@xcite , inclusion of the causality constraint in an impact - parameter - based analysis of the two - body bremsstrahlung interaction around a @xmath107 black hole leads to an upper limit of @xmath387 on the total fraction of energy emitted in two - body bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "charged and/or colored particles ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath388 , @xmath389 ) and photons which are directly emitted by the black hole could participate in the rare bremsstrahlung or pair - production interactions .",

    "thus all observable spectra , except the highest energy @xmath391 flux which is directly emitted , may be very slightly modified by interactions . as we discuss in ref .",
    "@xcite , at low energies the photon spectrum from an individual black hole will be enhanced by two other @xmath303 and @xmath305 bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "in contrast , the low energy particles in the spectra from a pbh background were originally emitted with higher energies and then cosmologically redshifted to low energies @xcite , and so the background spectra can be only slightly modified at low energies ( by the rare interactions near the black hole ) . in summary , the observable spectra from an individual black hole or pbh background remain those of the standard hawking picture .",
    "the time - integrated background spectra above @xmath392 mev should maintain their original @xmath393 form @xcite with little amplitude change , in contrast to the @xmath394 slope predicted by the heckler model @xcite .",
    "the limits on @xmath7 derived at @xmath395 using the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath103 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 background spectra @xcite will not be significantly affected .",
    "we also note that the high energy limits on the detectability of individual holes , which are derived at @xmath95 , are not sensitive to behaviour around @xmath322 but the limits on @xmath7 , which are derived at @xmath396 , may be .",
    "this is because at @xmath396 most particles in the integrated spectra from a pbh background are qcd jet products from @xmath397 black holes emitting in the present era @xcite .",
    "the galactic antiproton limit is less influenced by the behaviour around @xmath322 because most of the postgalactic pbh antiprotons are generated in somewhat higher energy qcd jets , due to the greater rest mass of the antiproton @xcite . in future work a more precise numerical modeling of the spectra at @xmath398 mev using our insights of section iv.k should be pursued .",
    "belyanin , kocharovsky , and kocharovsky @xcite have proposed an unrelated photosphere model , in which charged particles from the black hole  predominantly pions from the decay of hawking radiated quarks and gluons  form a well - defined ` collisionless ' plasma at @xmath160 .",

    "explicitly , they find that , when @xmath399 , the size of the plasma ( taken to be the distance from the black hole ) is greater than the debye radius @xmath400 ( effectively the inverse of the langmuir oscillation frequency  or plasma frequency  generated by the charged particle separation ) , and that @xmath400 is greater than the average separation between charged particles .",
    "the authors apply magneto - hydrodynamical equations for a plasma magnetic field in the case where the magnetic field is maximal , i.e. where the energy is equipartitioned between particle kinetic energy and the magnetic field .",

    "these involve the development , as the charged particles move away from the black hole , of unspecified plasma - wave turbulence or strong internal shocks .",
    "suggested shock generators are @xmath309 pairs created by electromagnetic cascade in the postulated magnetic field of the emitted particles , or collisions of emitted particles with the interstellar medium .",
    "the belyanin , kocharovsky , and kocharovsky scenario makes the following assumptions : that the charged particles interact sufficiently to form a plasma ; that a substantial magnetic field is generated by anisotropies in the charged particle distributions ; and that significant turbulence arises in this field . in analyzing this scenario ,",
    "we find that a number of the model components have been treated incorrectly .",
    "we conclude that a self - induced photosphere of this type should not occur around the black hole .",
    "first , langmuir oscillations are longitudinal oscillations that arise in a plasma when the positively charged particles move collectively in the opposite direction to or independently of the negatively charged particles .",
    "the mutual attraction between the separated positive and negative charges provides a restoring force that constrains the charged particles to oscillate around their equilibrium positions in the rest frame of the plasma .",
    "the oscillations can propagate along this axis of particle motion .",
    "for example , langmuir oscillations can occur in an ionic plasma placed in an external magnetic field .",
    "however , in the case of particles streaming away from a black hole , we note that there is no initial asymmetry in the distribution or response of positive and negative charges  for every particle , a neutral black hole stochastically emits on a short timescale an antiparticle of equal mass and opposite electric charge @xcite .",
    "any initial black hole charge is lost on a timescale much less than the age of the universe for @xmath403 @xcite .",
    "the remaining random charge fluctuations are of order the planck charge @xmath404 and therefore negligible @xcite .",
    "additionally , a neutral black hole has no intrinsic magnetic field .",
    "if emitted particles decay , total charge symmetry is preserved . in particular , the net electric charge of the final products of a qcd jet initiated by a decaying quark is equal to the negligibly small charge of the original quark , i.e. @xmath405 or @xmath406 .",
    "moreover , self - induced qed turbulence is not observed in accelerator jets .",

    "additionally , the magnetic field strength required for significant separation would appear to be unrealistically large in any astrophysical context .    if we consider the pions , electrons and positrons to be generated in qcd jets of opening angle @xmath458 , the transverse velocity may be as large as @xmath459 and so the maximum separation is given by @xmath460 for @xmath461 and @xmath462 smaller for @xmath65 . at accelerator energies , @xmath463 @xcite .",

    "rees has also proposed a model in which the high energy electrons emitted by an expiring black hole form an expanding conducting shell which will be braked by any ambient galactic magnetic field @xcite .",

    "as we have seen , the belyanin , kocharovsky , and kocharovsky mechanism is not viable in the absence of a large external magnetic field .",
    "the second mechanism postulates that the emitted particles undergo a first - order phase transition around @xmath322 , accompanied by rapid loss of the remaining black hole mass via a hagedorn - type exponential increase in the number of hadronic degrees of freedom at @xmath322 , without the black hole temperature climbing above @xmath1 .",

    "the standard hawking picture , in which the black hole emits only those particles which are fundamental on the scale of the black hole and which was discussed in detail in section iv.k , is consistent with current accelerator observations .",

    "similarly an @xmath469 black hole should emit pions as fundamental particles .",
    "furthermore , in the hagedorn picture the exponential distribution of resonances are possible particle states but whether the states are occupied is determined by the available energy .",

    "this would violate the condition of the original hagedorn model @xcite in which the exponential growth in the density of states results from the temperature being held constant .",
    "hence , based on the observed behavior in accelerators , there should be no rapid increase in the black hole evaporation rate as @xmath470 and no gamma - ray photosphere burst of the type envisioned by cline and hong .",
    "the ` fireball ' model proposed by moss @xcite , in which a phase - transition at the @xmath1 threshold generates a confining bubble around the black hole , is also not consistent with accelerator observations .",
    "note that the cline and hong ` fireball ' model is not related to the heckler bremsstrahlung - induced photosphere .",
    "a heckler - type photosphere involves only interactions of particles after emission and is not accompanied by a rapid increase in the hawking evaporation rate .",
    "although our analysis rules out photospheres in such models , we can not exclude the possibility that black hole explosions could generate short - period gamma - ray bursts by some other as yet unconsidered mechanism or by placement , for example , in unusual magnetic field configurations .",
    "the possibility that one might detect black hole explosions ( and thereby test the hawking theory ) at the present epoch is so important that all such scenarios are worth exploring . in particular , it is important to examine whether short - period gamma - ray bursts have other characteristics expected of a pbh population , independent of knowledge of the specific burst production mechanism .",
    "after careful examination of the heckler photosphere model , we find that the emitted particles are not expected to interact sufficiently to form a qed or qcd photosphere around an evaporating black hole .",
    "key to determining the fate of the emission is understanding the causality constraint and scatterings which occur within a distance @xmath118 or @xmath471 of the hole .",
    "our main point is that no qed photosphere can form around a black hole because a particle must be causally connected to any particle it interacts with and requires a distance @xmath0 to form in each bremsstrahlung interaction .",
    "this means that each particle is highly unlikely to interact and generally undergoes at most one net interaction as it streams away from the hole .",
    "neither heckler nor cline , mostoslavsky , and servant include these effects .",
    "instead they envision a scenario in which each emitted particle undergoes a sequence of interactions . in heckler s model",
    "these start at a radius less than @xmath239 and continue to a radius greater than @xmath239 ; in the cline , mostoslavsky , and servant simulations , they start at a radius much less than @xmath239 and continue to @xmath239 .",
    "furthermore , the modification required to their models is not a simple one , since the causality and formation distance constraints and a corrected geometrical description must go into the analysis at the start and can not simply be added later .",
    "additional qcd phenomenological arguments , based on the limited energy per initial particle and availability of qcd final states , also rule out qcd photosphere ( chromosphere ) development around @xmath322 .",
    "although we find that photosphere formation is not supported , an emitted particle may occasionally undergo one net qed interaction within a distance @xmath118 of the black hole or one net qcd interaction within @xmath471 .",
    "however , this interaction could only very slightly modify the observable @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath103 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 spectra from a pbh background or an individual high - temperature black hole .",
    "the spectra remain essentially those of the standard hawking model , with little change to the detection probability .",
    "we also find that interactions are insufficient to support other models for photosphere formation or enhanced pbh signals proposed in the literature , unless the black hole is located in an unusual ambient environment or standard model physics breaks down .    in this paper",
    ", we have not addressed the emission expected from higher - dimensional black holes which may be created at tev or higher energies in accelerators @xcite or cosmic ray interactions @xcite .",
    "our analysis implies that the spectra which were calculated , in for example refs .",
    "@xcite , assuming heckler - type interactions between the particles emitted in the final burst of evaporation from a higher - dimensional black hole will need to be modified .",
    "in particular , the issues raised in sections iv.b , d , f , g , h and k will need to be applied to the analysis of the spectra from higher - dimensional black holes .",
    "in the case of accelerator experiments , the relevant condition to investigate is whether @xmath472 is approached , because even one interaction per particle may modify the spectra significantly compared with experimental precision . a number of the issues we raise were independently recently included in the numerical simulation of the decay of cern lhc tev - scale black holes by alig , drees and oda @xcite .",
    "they concluded that scattering between partons emitted by the higher - dimensional black hole is insufficient to form a thermalized chromosphere .",
    "although their methodology was restricted to scattering between partons which approach each other and included a lower cutoff of @xmath473 in the exchanged transverse momentum , their results provide insight into the applicability of the heckler scenario to tev - scale higher - dimensional black holes .",
    "our discussion of geometrical and causality considerations in section iv.f and in our accompanying paper @xcite may be viewed as a partial justification of the approximation used in @xcite of only including scattering between partons which approach each other .",
