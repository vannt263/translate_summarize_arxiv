    "sensitive atomic magnetometers have recently found application in the field of magnetic resonance imaging @xcite , magneto - encephalography @xcite , and searches for physics beyond the standard model @xcite . a recent review may be found in ref .",
    "the most sensitive atomic magnetometers presently are the spin - exchange relaxation free ( serf ) magnetometers @xcite in which relaxation due to spin - exchange collisions is eliminated by operating in the regime where the spin - exchange rate is much greater than the rate of larmor precession @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , sensitivity of @xmath8 was achieved with the cell operating at @xmath9 using potassium atoms .",
    "estimates of the fundamental sensitivity limit of such magnetometers are several orders of magnitude better for a @xmath10 volume and scale as the square - root of the spin - destruction cross section .    here",
    "we demonstrate operation of a cs magnetometer in the serf regime , achieving a sensitivity of about @xmath4 with a vapor cell temperature of only @xmath11 .",
    "the overlapping volume of the pump and probe beams is about @xmath12 , but the effective volume , determined by diffusion , is about @xmath7 . based on optical rotation measurements , the projected photon shot noise limit for our experimental conditions is about @xmath5 .",
    "the spin - destruction cross section for cs is @xmath13 , about 200 times larger than for k @xcite .",
    "hence , the fundamental sensitivity of a cs serf magnetometer should be roughly a factor of 14 worse than one based on k. however , it is often the case that environmental noise due to , for example , johnson currents in magnetic shields is far larger than atomic shot noise , and hence little is lost by using cs .",
    "one of the primary motivations for investigating cs in the serf regime is the fact that it has the highest saturated vapor pressure of all the stable alkalis , yielding significantly lower operating temperatures .",
    "this opens up the possibility of operating in the serf regime with paraffin coated cells , of interest due to the lower light power requirements in evacuated cells .",
    "the low temperature aspect of cs is also attractive for applications such as nmr measurements with liquids in microfluidic channels , which is expected to be an important measurement modality in future `` lab - on - a - chip '' devices @xcite .",
    "a full treatment of the system requires the use of density matrix theory ( see , for example , ref @xcite ) .",
    "however , the description can be greatly simplified when the spin - exchange rate @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 is the alkali number density , @xmath16 is the spin - exchange cross section , and @xmath17 is the average relative velocity of the colliding alkali atoms ) is much faster than precession in the magnetic field , @xmath18 . here @xmath19 is the electron land factor , @xmath20 is the bohr magneton , @xmath21 is the magnitude of an applied magnetic field , and @xmath22 is the nuclear spin . in this case",
    "the density matrix assumes a spin - temperature distribution and the ground state can be well described by bloch equations for the electron spin polarization @xmath23 @xcite : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the optical pumping vector along the direction of propagation of the pump with magnitude equal to the degree of circular polarization , @xmath26 is the optical pumping rate due to the pump beam , and @xmath27 is the rate of depolarization due to the linearly polarized probe beam .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is the nuclear slowing - down factor , which for nuclear spin @xmath29 , is @xcite @xmath30 in the low polarization limit @xmath31 , while in the high polarization limit , @xmath32 .",
    "the latter limit , when all atoms are pumped into the stretched state , corresponds to the slowing down factor for nuclear spin @xmath29 in the absence of spin - exchange collisions @xmath33 . in eq . , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the longitudinal and transverse ( with respect to @xmath36 ) relaxation times , respectively .",
    "the transverse relaxation time can be written @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electron spin - destruction rate and @xmath39 is the contribution to relaxation from spin - exchange collisions . for low polarizations and small magnetic fields , relaxation due to spin - exchange",
    "is quadratic in the magnetic field @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 .    in some of the measurements described below , small",

    ", the effects of optical pumping and the optical properties of the medium can be treated with an effective ground state formalism @xcite . when the pressure broadened optical width",

    "the cell has a roughly cubic profile , about 2 cm on a side .",

    "the oven was designed so that the optical path was unperturbed by the flowing air . at @xmath69 ,",
    "the saturated cs vapor concentration is about @xmath70=1.7\\times 10^{13}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ ] .",
    "optical pumping was accomplished by circularly polarized laser light propagating in the @xmath42 direction tuned to the center of the cs d1 line ( the exact tuning was chosen to minimize light shifts ) .",

    "however , the signal is the product of the transmission and optical rotation , and since there are many optical depths in our cell ( on resonance , 1 cm corresponds to about 12 optical depths under the conditions of our measurements ) , it was necessary to detune far from resonance .",

    "in fig . [ fig : byscan ] the solid curves show the magneto - optical rotation of a weak probe beam ( @xmath76 ) as a function of magnetic field @xmath72 for two different pump intensities .",
    "the dashed line overlaying the data for weak pump light , @xmath77 , is a fit based on eq . with @xmath78 . for more intense pump light @xmath79",

    "fig : byscan_params ] we plot the width and peak - to - peak amplitude of the optical rotation for the single feature observed for pump intensities below about @xmath82 ( stars ) and for the nested features observed at higher pump intensities ( squares and triangles ) . in either regime , the width is linear in light intensity . when the two features become resolved , the amplitude of the broad resonance appears saturated , while the amplitude of the narrow resonance continues to grow , approaching saturation at the highest light power .",
    "+    the difference in the behavior of magneto - optical rotation for low and high pump intensities is essentially due to diffusion of atoms into and out of the pump beam , creating two regions with differing polarization and rates of power broadening .",
    "similar narrowing effects due to diffusion have been observed in the context of electromagnetically induced transparency in buffer gas cells @xcite .",
    "nested resonances have also been observed in the context of nonlinear magneto - optical rotation in paraffin coated cells @xcite . in a simplified model , the cell can be divided into regions illuminated and dark with respect to the pump beam .",
    "the optical pumping rate @xmath26 inside the pump beam is determined by eq .",
    "so that the power broadened width and polarization of atoms inside the pump beam is given by eqs . and .",
    "the region outside the pump beam is polarized via diffusion and hence the average optical pumping rate is suppressed by the ratio @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the rate of diffusion of atoms into and out of the pump beam .",

    "the polarization of the region outside the pump beam is smaller than inside the pump beam by a factor @xmath83 and hence the amplitude of optical rotation is dominated by the region inside the pump beam . when the optical pumping rate inside the beam is large compared to @xmath38 , the region inside the pump beam becomes saturated and optical rotation is sufficiently broadened so that the smaller narrow feature due to the region outside the pump beam becomes distinguishable . as @xmath26 becomes large compared to @xmath86 ,",

    "the reason for the difference in pump rates determined from the amplitude and the rate of broadening is due to diffusion as discussed above : the pump rate determined by the broadening will be dominated by the illuminated region , while the pump rate determined from the amplitude represents an average pump rate over the volume the polarized atoms occupy during the course of one relaxation period .",

    ", one might conclude that the atomic shot noise limit scales as @xmath140 .",
    "however , it turns out that the nuclear slowing down factor drops out of the problem .",
    "the reasons are somewhat subtle , so we go into some detail .",
    "spin - projection noise arises ( in the present geometry ) due to uncertainty in the @xmath60 component of angular momentum @xmath141 , defined as @xmath142 . for a spin temperature distribution with polarization in the @xmath42 direction , @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the spin temperature parameter @xcite , @xmath145 .",

    "this limit can be obtained from the angular momentum commutation relations @xmath154 which yield the minimum uncertainty @xmath155 .",
    "if all the atoms are in the stretched state , corresponding to @xmath156 , @xmath157 , we have , again assuming uncorrelated atoms , @xmath158 .",
    "the uncertainty in the low polarization limit is somewhat larger , @xmath159 .",
    "this limit can also be verified by noting that for an unpolarized sample @xmath160 and @xmath161 . as an aside",
    ", we note that the reduction in uncertainty @xmath162 with increasing polarization only occurs for angular momentum greater than 1/2 .    after measuring continuously for time @xmath137",
    "long compared to the lifetime of the polarization , @xmath163 , the uncertainty is @xcite @xmath164 in a spin - temperature distribution , the ratio of the total angular momentum to that stored in the electron is given by @xmath28 , @xmath165 @xcite and thus @xmath166 from eq .",
    ", we find for all fields zeroed , that the uncertainty @xmath167 in a measurement of @xmath72 is related to flucutations of @xmath43 by @xmath168 inserting eq . into eq .",
    "we find that the spin - projection noise is @xmath169 it is interesting to note that this result is independent of any nuclear slowing - down factors .",
    "neglecting broadening due to the probe beam , the minimum value of spin - projection noise @xmath170 is obtained when @xmath171 .",
    "we now address photon shot noise . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assume that the volume @xmath172 occupied by the sample is a cube with sides of length @xmath62 , fully illuminated by both pump and probe .",
    "if the probe beam is detuned far from resonance so that the medium is optically thin , optical rotation drops slowly , scaling as @xmath173 , compared to absorption which scales as @xmath174 , a very favorable situation .",
    "in this case , photon shot noise in the optical rotation angle is given by @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the probe photon intensity and @xmath177 is the cross section of the probe beam . combining this with eqs . and , the photon shot noise contribution to magnetic field sensitivity is @xmath178 this can be rearranged @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the optical depth on resonance and @xmath181 is the probe rate for far detuned light .    adding spin - projection noise eq . and photon shot noise eq . in quadrature , yields @xmath182 inspection of eq .",
    "shows that the probe pump rate can be increased until @xmath183 without significant increase to either spin - projection noise or photon shot noise .",
    "if the resonant optical depth @xmath184 is sufficiently large , the contribution from photon shot noise becomes negligible . in the limit of infinite resonant optical depth eq .",
    "is optimized for @xmath185 and @xmath186 so that @xmath187 for a volume of @xmath7 and a density of @xmath188 , and spin - destruction rate @xmath189 obtained in the experiment at @xmath127 , this expression evaluates to about @xmath190 , where we have assumed that a bandwidth of 1 hz corresponds to a measurement time of 0.5 s. in the experiment , spin - destruction collisions due to alkali - alkali collisions accounted for only about 1/3 of the total spin - destruction rate , so somewhat higher sensitivities may be achieved by operating at higher temperatures where alkali - alkali collisions dominate the spin - destruction rate .",
    "the above analysis indicates that optimal sensitivity is achieved when the probe is tuned sufficiently far from resonance so that the medium is optically thin , minimizing photon shot noise .",
    "practical limitations such as finite light power will limit how far one can detune from resonance . dropping the assumption of large probe detuning one finds , for the parameters described above and probe light tuned 3 optical linewidths away from resonance so that the optical depth is about 1/3 , that the sensitivity is roughly a factor of 2 larger than the spin - projection noise limit .",
    "of course , technical sources of noise due to , e.g. vibrations or air currents , are often much larger than photon shot noise . in this case",
    ", it is desirable to tune the laser closer to optical resonance so that the optical rotation due to small magnetic fields is larger than other sources of noise .",
    "finally , we note that the optimal tuning of the probe light depends on the particulars of the probing scheme .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite considers the case of nonlinear magneto - optical rotation , where optimal sensitivity is achieved when the probe is tuned so that there is roughly one optical depth .",
    "the primary reason for the difference is that optical rotation in that case scales ( similarly to absorption ) as the inverse square of the detuning ."
