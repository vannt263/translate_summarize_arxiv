    "bl lac objects , being highly continuum - dominated , are a perennial problem for those wishing to study the evolution of agn populations .",
    "the lack of visible broad lines and , even more , the low equivalent width of host absorption features makes redshift determinations extraordinarily difficult . yet , since the continuum domination is a manifestation of the good alignment of the relativistic jet outflow to the earth line - of - sight , @xcite knowledge of the distance , and hence luminosity scale , of these sources is very interesting .",
    "this problem has become particularly important with gamma - ray detection of large numbers of blazars with the _ fermi _ lat @xcite .",
    "it has been known since _",
    "egret _ that radio loud flat spectrum blazars dominate the bright extragalactic sources in the gev sky @xcite ; these objects are flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and radio loud bl lacs .",
    "we have good techniques in place to identify likely radio counterparts for the gamma - ray sources .",
    "extensive spectroscopy campaigns , especially on the egret - like ` cgrabs ' sample @xcite have provided nearly complete redshifts and characterizations of the fsrq . however , despite extensive observation , including 8+m telescope integrations , less than half of the bl lac counterparts have spectroscopic ids . in some cases , high quality spectroscopy can give useful lower limits on the source redshift @xcite , but many remain unconstrained . in the first lat blazar catalog @xcite ,",
    "the problem is even more pronounced since the excellent high energy response of the lat favors detection of hard spectrum sources .",
    "bl lacs are substantially harder ( @xmath1 ) than fsrq ( @xmath2 ) and so provide a larger fraction , @xmath3% of the _ fermi _ blazar sample , than was seen by _",
    "we attempt here to constrain the redshifts of radio loud bl lacs which have shown no convincing spectroscopic redshift solution , despite sensitive observations on large telescopes , by high dynamic range imaging searches for the agn host .",
    "our targets are drawn from the ` crates ' catalog of bright flat - spectrum @xmath4 radio sources @xcite .",
    "specifically , in this program we targeted the subset of crates consisting of @xmath5 ) sources selected as likely gamma - ray blazars before the fermi mission ( i.e. cgrabs sources , healey et al .",
    "2008 ) and @xmath6 ) sources that are likely counterparts to lat sources detected early in the mission @xcite .",
    "all sources are at declination @xmath7 and all have been shown to display featureless optical spectra @xcite , with sensitive ( 4m+ class ) observations .",
    "we were able to image @xmath8 of the sources satisfying these critera at the time of the observing campaigns .",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that bl lac host galaxies detected with hst imaging are remarkably uniform giant ellipticals with @xmath9 ; accordingly host detections can give redshift estimates and upper limits on the host flux can give lower limits on the distance .",
    "here we do not test this assumption or the possible biases that would select a modest magnitude range for the detected host sample .",
    "we simply apply the method to extract redshift constraints , noting that while individual redshifts are doubtless imprecise , the estimates can still be useful for statistical studies of bl lac evolution and as a guide to and comparison with other methods of redshift estimation .",
    "conversely , when precision spectroscopic redshifts become available , our measurements can be used to help constrain the host evolution .",
    "since we will be searching for de vaucouleurs profile excesses in the wings of the stellar psf of the bright bl lac core , we require good natural seeing and a moderate field of view for adequate comparison stars .",
    "for example , while near - ir adaptive optics can deliver superior psf cores , the wings of the source at @xmath1090% encircled energy are extensive and often quite variable over the small corrected fov .",
    "this prevents the accurate psf modeling and subtraction required to obtain host measurements whose integrated magnitude can be 10% or less of the core flux .",
    "all observations were carried out using the wiyn 3.6 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory , which features good natural seeing and a @xmath11 fov with the standard mosaic imagers .",
    "we employed optic on the nights of 2008 oct .",
    "31  nov . 2 for our initial imaging run .",
    "this 2@xmath122k@xmath124k camera covers 9.6@xmath13 at 0.14@xmath14/pixel and features lincoln labs orthogonal transfer ccds , which allow rapid electronic ( ot ) tracking using an appropriate in - field guide star . with a relatively short ( 25s ) read - out time , we were able to combine short exposures that avoided core saturation with longer exposures that probe for the host galaxies in the psf wings .",
    "the targets were imaged with the sdss @xmath0 filter kpno 1586 .",
    "we observed 31 targets , with total on - source time ranging from 210s to 2100s ( table [ optic_results ] ) .",
    "sky conditions were photometric through the run , and we were able to employ ot guiding for the bulk of the sources , with correction rates up to 50 hz .",
    "the final @xmath0 image quality had a median fwhm of 0.65@xmath14 ; the best 25% of the sources had image stacks with fwhm @xmath15 .",
    "a period during which mirror cooling was lost resulted in some observations with poor psf ( up to 1@xmath14 ) .",
    "software problems in addition cost several hours .",
    "while ot guiding significantly improves the source psf , which is crucial for our science goals , it does create some complications during data reduction .",
    "in particular , flat - field frames must be created for each individual exposure , with weighted exposure per pixel following the history of ot offsets during each individual exposure .",
    "this creates some challenges in assembling the final mosaic images , as defects can affect adjacent pixels .",
    "the ` smoothing ' of the flat - field response also affects the noise statistics of the final image .",
    "the data were processed using routines in the iraf package ` mscred ` . with the excellent psf ( as small as 0.4@xmath14 ) achieved for some frames , we required superior camera distortion corrections at each position angle ; for some orientations a lack of field stars limited the accuracy of the astrometric solution . after registration and exposure - weighting ,",
    "median combined image stacks were prepared for further analysis .",
    "observations were made using the mini - mosaic camera ( minimo ) on the nights of 2009 march 24 - 25 , under highly variable conditions .",
    "the 2@xmath122k@xmath124k mosaic similarly has a plate scale of 0.14@xmath14/pixel and covers a field of 9.6 arcmin .",
    "we again employed the sdss @xmath0 filter . because of the long ( @xmath163 minute ) readout time of the mini - mosaic camera , most objects had 3 - 5 dithered exposures of 300s each .",
    "these relatively long exposures meant that many of the bl lac targets had saturated cores , despite the typically poorer final image quality during this run ( median final fwhm 0.84@xmath14 ) .",
    "the exposure sequences and final diq for each object are listed in table [ minimo_results ] . in all , 18 bl lacs were observed . since",
    "early lat detections had been announced by this run @xcite we were able to specially target known gamma - ray emitters lacking redshift solutions .",
    "the sky transparency was variable and half the run was lost to high winds and poor seeing .",
    "minimo employs conventional ccds , and so standard reductions were conducted with the iraf package ` mscred ` .",
    "camera distortions were mapped using usno a2.0 catalog stars ; these were also used to assign a wcs to each frame . after processing and bad pixel correction the individual dither frames were aligned using unsaturated stars near the bl lac , exposure weighted and median combined using standard sigma - clipping algorithms to produce our final images .",
    "minimo suffers from ` ghost ' images due to amplifier cross - talk .",
    "care was taken during target acquisitions to ensure that these did not fall in the vicinity of the bl lac .",
    "we made no attempt to correct these ghosts , but avoid using any affected comparison stars .",
    "a number of the target fields were covered by the sdss , so we were able to establish our zero point directly from standard aperture photometry of unsaturated field stars ( 16 @xmath17 19 ) .",
    "for the optic run only six fields had suitable stars .",
    "the median rms of these zero point measurements was 0.052 mag .",
    "while this was significantly larger than the intrinsic sdss photometric errors , the scatter is smaller than our typical host photometric errors and much smaller than the scatter in the claimed absolute magnitude of the bl lac host ( @xmath18mag ) . for the exposures lacking sdss comparison stars",
    ", we applied the mean zero point after correction for atmospheric extinction @xcite .",
    "given that conditions were photometric throughout , we are conservative in assigning the 0.068 scatter between the zero point measurements as the final zero - point error . while conditions were variable during the minimo observations , 12/18 fields had stars suitable for direct sdss cross - calibrations . in particular for four observations logged as cloudy we were able to establish in - field calibration .",
    "taking the rms zero point from the remainder of the fields , we established , after extinction correction , a zero point with scatter of 0.036 mag .",
    "this was applied to the remaining target fields .",
    "accurate psf modeling is essential to extract the bl lac host from the wings of the nuclear point source .",
    "we built an effective psf in the stacked image of each bl lac using the iraf / daophot ` psf ` routine .",
    "psf stars were selected from those that appeared in all sub - frames making up the image stack , had stellar fwhm and appeared isolated .",
    "psf stars were selected by hand and were individually checked for consistency with a stellar fwhm . in practice",
    "the process was iterative ; some otherwise desirable psf template stars had faint unresolved sources in the wings , so we modeled and subtracted these sources before recombining for an improved psf .",
    "point sources as faint as @xmath19 were removed in this manner .",
    "each template psf has a radius of 5.6@xmath14 and covers over 11 fwhm even for our worst diq images .",
    "the background level for each psf star was determined from the mode of a 2@xmath204@xmath14 wide annulus starting at 7@xmath14 from the star . in a few of the images with poor seeing",
    "the background was determined from larger radius , to ensure insignificant contamination from the psf wings .",
    "to best model the psf wings , we also used some stars with nonlinear cores . above the non - linearity level ( 30,000 adu for optic , 40,000 adu for minimo ) ,",
    "the cores were masked in the psf stack .",
    "we found that a psf model with linear gradients across the image @xcite was required to take full advantage of the small fwhm of the best optic data . to guide our",
    "fitting we examined the spatial dependence of the fwhm .",
    "three terms might be expected to contribute to psf degradation .",
    "first , we expect the efficacy of the low order atmospheric corrections to fall off with distance from the guide star .",
    "we attempted to mitigate this effect by guiding in the target quadrant , whenever possible .",
    "second , distortions in the camera system are expected to increase away from the optical axis ( assumed to be near the field center ) .",
    "finally , since our principal frame registration is on the bl lac core , registration or residual rotation errors could degrade the psf as a function of distance from the target itself . to test for these effects , we collected fwhm measurements of unresolved sources across a number of fields . in no case",
    "did we find the psf was primarily correlated with distance to the target either in the individual exposures or in the final combined images , implying that stacking error was not important . in some cases the psf degradation appeared correlated with distance from the optical axis , implicating camera distortions , but for other images",
    "the distance from the guide star appeared to dominate ( see figure [ fig : comparison ] ) .    with the poorer seeing experienced during our minimo run , we found that the spatial variation of the psf was much less important , with the fwhm varying by no more than a few @xmath21pixels ( @xmath22 ) across the field of view .",
    "again stacking errors were negligible .",
    "however for consistency we fit for and applied linear gradients in the psf model .",
    "thus , in forming the final model psf for the analysis , we were able to draw stars from across the fields avoiding only the outermost corners of the frames , where there was notable degradation .",
    "in general between @xmath16 1/6 and @xmath16 1/5 of the psf stars used were saturated in their cores ( only @xmath16 1/9 with minimo , given the poorer seeing ) .",
    "tables [ optic_results ] and [ minimo_results ] list the number of psf stars used in each image .",
    "the median number of psf stars for each field was 30 for both optic and minimo .",
    "previous studies @xcite indicate that bl lac hosts are better fit by de vaucouleurs profiles than exponential disks .",
    "we therefore adopt simple de vaucouleurs profiles with fixed sersic index 4 , convolving the model with the image psf , in our galaxy fitting .",
    "we did find examples of disturbed galaxies and hosts with faint companions , but no host appeared disk - dominated .",
    "our bl lac image model includes up to five parameters , introduced hierarchically .",
    "we start by fitting for nuclear ( psf ) flux plus possible host .",
    "we assume that the host galaxy isophotes are centered on the nucleus @xcite , and fit or bound the host flux , initially assuming a a fixed effective radius of @xmath23 ( 10 kpc at @xmath24 ; we assume @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 throughout this paper ) .",
    "we next allow the de vaucouleurs profile @xmath29 to vary , when required by a high significance for a measurement of @xmath29 in the fit .",
    "finally for a few bl lacs , we find a significant detection of host ellipticity ; in these cases we include the ellipticity @xmath30 and position angle @xmath31 as additional free parameters in the fit . after fitting the host normalization",
    ", we report galaxy magnitudes by extrapolating the integrated light to infinity .    to prepare for host fitting",
    ", we determine the centroid position of the core psf , using the daophot task ` peak ` , which matches to the model psf , excluding pixels above our ( conservative ) non - linearity threshold ( 30,000 adu for optic , 40,000 adu for minimo ) , and delivering centroid coordinates accurate to @xmath32 pixels .",
    "since a number of our images were saturated , this clipping was important for obtaining accurate centroids . in almost all cases",
    ", the galaxy surface brightness dropped below the background surface brightness fluctuations within our standard @xmath33 psf radius . accordingly",
    "the bl lac image model was fit to @xmath34 cutouts from the image stack centered on the bl lac core pixel .",
    "daophot provides a 2@xmath12-oversampled psf model .",
    "this was re - binned to the original pixel size , using the precisely determined centroid and then used in the subsequent fitting .",
    "this psf centering and re - sampling proved to be quite accurate ",
    "dipole structure was never evident in residuals to our final bl lac model , whereas with even 0.05 pixel shifts for the bl lac core position such residuals were obvious .",
    "we apply our bl lac fit to a subset of the pixels in the cutouts around each bl lac .",
    "first all pixels beyond @xmath33 ( outside the psf model ) are masked .",
    "pixels associated with resolved objects within the fitting radius but more than three fwhm from the bl lac core are also masked ( in practice we exclude rectangular regions , see figure [ fig : j0814_blanking ] ) .",
    "unresolved objects more than three fwhm away are fit to the psf model and then treated as fixed background . occasionally , very bright nearby stellar objects show significant residuals at the psf core after subtraction ; in these cases a few pixel rectangular region is masked at the core before the final bl lac fit .",
    "the occasional column or pixel defect or cosmic ray are similarly masked .",
    "finally we mask the pixels within 1 fwhm in diameter of the bl lac core . in roughly 25% of the optic images this was required in any case due to non - linear adu levels .",
    "however , we found that sampling noise at 1 fwhm could dominate the fit statistics , so a consistent exclusion of pixels at the core was used for all objects .",
    "for a few of the brightest objects , we extended the core exclusion region to 1.5 fwhm , while for a few of the faintest , we used 0.5 fwhm .",
    "the final results were not sensitive to the precise value used .    for each bl lac model",
    "the background was determined from an annulus starting at 7@xmath14 containing 2 - 3@xmath12 the pixel count of the psf model region ; for a few poor seeing images and bl lacs with very extended hosts we used a larger annulus .",
    "[ h ]    preparing the fitting region for j0814 + 6431 ( image fwhm @xmath35 ) .",
    "one resolved companion and pixels near the centroid of the nuclear component are masked .",
    "the corrected fov is @xmath36 in radius ; n up , e left . ]",
    "for all multi - parameter fits , the parameters are determined by minimization of the quantity :    @xmath38    where the sum is over the @xmath39 unmasked pixels in the fitting region , @xmath40 is the observed intensity in adu , @xmath41 is the model intensity in adu and @xmath42 is the expected variance .",
    "the model is the sum of the constant background , psf and host galaxy terms , where the analytic host model is integrated over a given pixel to determine the galaxy contribution .",
    "the variance is estimated according to simple poisson statistics to be :    @xmath43    where for optic the gain was @xmath44 and for minimo 1.4@xmath45 .",
    "the read noise @xmath46 is @xmath47 ( optic ) or 5.5@xmath48 ( minimo ) and our final image stack is the from the median of @xmath49 normalized single exposures .",
    "this is a simplification since for optic the orthogonal transfer during integration correlated the sky noise ( likely an artifact of imperfect flat - fielding ) .",
    "also the residual pixel noise in the unmasked region adds to the variance for sharp images .",
    "nevertheless we find that this variance is a reasonable first approximation to the local noise , and we can determine the best - fit model by @xmath37 minimization .",
    "we use the simulated annealing algorithm from press et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .",
    "the final size of the simplex in @xmath50 dimensions gives the relative errors between the @xmath51 estimates of the fitting parameters .",
    "we would like to relate this to the 1@xmath52 statistical error , to provide a standard statistical error estimate for each parameter .",
    "we do this by scaling to an externally estimated 1@xmath52 error determined for each point source flux @xmath53 .",
    "we determine this error by analogy with standard aperture photometry .",
    "in our case the central fwhm is masked in the fit so we compute the fractional error in the psf amplitude for an annulus outside the masked region of width 1 fwhm as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the source flux ( adu ) within the photometry annulus , @xmath56 is the number of pixels within the annulus , @xmath57 is the standard deviation of the background ( adu ) , and @xmath58 is the number of pixels used to determine the background value .",
    "the first term under the radical is poisson noise .",
    "the second is a statistical uncertainty due to the random fluctuations and unresolved sources in the background .",
    "the final term accounts for the possibility of a poisson error in background level .",
    "the first term generally dominates , and thus @xmath59 is @xmath60 as the annulus contains roughly 1/2 the flux of an aperture without the central mask .",
    "we found a typical @xmath59 for our psf stars of @xmath61 .",
    "with the large number of counts for the point sources measured here , even small centroiding errors can in principle contribute to the error , since a varying fraction of the point source falls in the central masked pixels . to test for this in each psf fit",
    ", we artificially shifted the model psf position by @xmath32pixels , the maximum centroiding error , in each coordinate .",
    "the rms variation in the included counts was computed to estimate @xmath62 , the fractional error in flux estimation due to imprecise centroiding .",
    "although this error only became comparable to @xmath59 for a few of the brightest point sources , we sum it in quadrature to compute our statistical photometry error as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the total number of counts for the point source in adu .",
    "as noted above , the size and shape of the simplex determined from our @xmath37 minimization provides _ relative _ fitting errors .",
    "we adjusted our convergence criterion such that the rms spread about the mean fit value for the psf amplitude was always close to @xmath53 which , since the nuclear point source always dominates the model , is a very good estimate of the true model - fit statistical error .",
    "thus , by rescaling the simplex amplitude such that the rms spread in the nucleus flux estimates was equal to this photometric error @xmath53 , we have normalized the simplex - determined error to be 1@xmath52 ( statistical ) in each quantity .",
    "we call this error @xmath65 .      since our models are dominated by the bright core psf , which is different for each exposure , and since we have a limited number of stars in each frame to generate a psf model , our final uncertainty must be dominated by systematic errors due to imperfections in this model .",
    "this is in contrast to the hst - based fitting of @xcite , where the psf is , of course , stable and well - modeled and unresolved background structure dominated the final uncertainty .",
    "we therefore wish to estimate our systematic psf uncertainty .",
    "we do so by fitting for a de vaucouleurs host around unresolved stellar sources . in each image stack",
    "we choose such test stars relatively close to the bl lac with comparable brightness . on average",
    "we were able to measure seven such stars per image .",
    "ideally none would have been used in forming the psf , but since these are the stars most suitable for psf modeling , they were largely included . before fitting ,",
    "each star was treated exactly as its associated bl lac , including the same masking of central pixels .",
    "we then fit for the psf amplitude and ` host ' amplitude , with the de vaucouleurs @xmath23 fixed at our default radius .",
    "the fit host amplitude could either be negative ( indicating excess wings on the model psf ) or positive ( psf model too narrow ) .",
    "note that decreasing the host angular size would weaken constraints on its amplitude , since it would be more highly covariant with the psf .",
    "our adopted value ( appropriate for a typical @xmath66kpc at @xmath24 ) is reasonably conservative ; even at the minimum angular size at @xmath67 , this would only decrease by 28% .",
    "the dispersion in the amplitudes of the fitted ` host ' fluxes provides an estimate of our systematic uncertainty .",
    "however , since the stellar fluxes covered a substantial range , we elected to scale the ` host ' flux significance to the statistical error on this flux for each test star @xmath65 the rms spread in the ` host ' fluxes fit around the test stars , in units of @xmath65 , then provides an estimate of the systematic error , for each individual bl lac field .",
    "figure [ fig : systematic ] shows the distribution of ` host ' significance ( @xmath68 ) for the test stars in the optic and minimo fields , along with the distribution of the rms significance for the individual fields .",
    "the rms significance of these ` host ' fits for optic and minimo were 8.3@xmath69 and 8.0@xmath69 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that our statistical ( poisson ) errors on the host flux substantially underestimate the true errors by @xmath70 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the distributions are approximately normal and that the mean fitted host flux is not significant .",
    "for the optic data , we obtain @xmath71 while for minimo the average is 0.1@xmath69 . in view of the systematic errors we expect random offsets of @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the two sets of test stars .",
    "we conclude that the frame - to - frame spread in upper limits on surrounding host galaxies are appreciably larger than expected from pure poisson statistics  this can be attributed to errors in forming the individual psf models and to unresolved structure in the psf stars and test stars backgrounds .",
    "however there is no _ overall _ introduced host flux ; implying that our psf model is a fair , albeit uncertain , representation of the data .    to be conservative",
    ", we adopt for our final error the _ sum _ of the statistical and systematic errors , namely @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the rms value of the individual test stars in the stacked image of an individual bl lac .",
    "this is conservative since while we expect the statistical errors to have a normal distribution , it would be very surprising if the much larger systematic errors had wings as large as a gaussian out to many times the fwhm of the distribution .",
    "we tested this error estimate by inserting poisson realizations of model hosts around isolated stars in several fields . for artificial galaxies assigned the total counts at the 3@xmath76 detection limit , we recovered host fluxes with rms errors of @xmath77 . in no case was the difference between the injected and recovered counts larger than @xmath78 .",
    "we constrain the properties of the bl lac host by the hierarchical fit .",
    "we first fit for a circularly symmetric host with fixed angular radius @xmath79 , just as for the test star measurements . the final uncertainty on the host counts is taken to be @xmath76 where the statistical error is taken from the simplex rescaled to the aperture photometry error for the bl lac core , while the systematic error is the multiple of this statistical error determined by ` host ' fits to the test stars in this bl lac s field , as described above .",
    "if the host flux is larger than @xmath80 ( which is dominated by the systematic uncertainty ) , we deem it significant .",
    "if the significance does not reach @xmath80 , we infer an upper limit of @xmath81 , or @xmath82 , whichever is larger .",
    "if there is a significant detection of a bl lac host , we next re - run the fits allowing the host angular radius @xmath29 to vary .",
    "the only fitting constraint is @xmath83 .",
    "if the best fit value of @xmath29 is less than the fwhm for the image , we do not deem it significant .",
    "a value for @xmath29 is only quoted if @xmath84 , where the final statistical plus systematic error is estimated from the re - scaled simplex , as above .",
    "significant estimates of @xmath29 were found for 25% of the optic - measured bl lacs and 33% of those measured with minimo .",
    "note that the overall flux and its fit error were free to vary , as well .",
    "as a consistency check , we note that in no case where a significant @xmath29 measurement was found , did the host flux measurement decrease in significance to below @xmath85 .",
    "finally , we attempted to fit for a significant host ellipticity , with two additional parameters @xmath30 and the position angle @xmath31 added to the model .",
    "these parameters both exceeded @xmath82 significance for only two of the bl lacs observed with optic .",
    "again the host flux and size @xmath29 were free in this final fit .",
    "tables [ optic_results ] and [ minimo_results ] contain the final fit nucleus and host amplitudes ( converted to magnitudes , see below ) and the host physical size ( when available ) .",
    "details of the observations ( exposure lengths , fwhm of the stellar sources and the number of stars used in the psf model ) are also listed .",
    "since @xcite have argued that bl lac host galaxies are standard candles with @xmath86 , we can use our measurements and upper limits on the host flux to extract redshift estimates and lower bounds . to do this",
    "we compute an @xmath0 hubble diagram for our kpno 1586 filter .",
    "we improve on the similar r - band hubble diagram of @xcite , by including host evolution , assuming a host ( elliptical ) formation redshift of @xmath87 @xcite . with this assumption",
    ", we adopt an elliptical galaxy spectrum computed at the appropriate age from the pegase model of @xcite , where the age is computed for each @xmath88 for our standard cosmology .",
    "to lock the overall normalization to the @xmath89 of @xcite , we fixed the flux of the @xmath90 , evolved elliptical spectrum to @xmath91 .",
    "this required folding through an @xmath46 filter .",
    "unfortunately the precise kpno kron - cousins @xmath46 filter used is not recorded , except in a private 1995 communication between j. holtzman and landolt @xcite .",
    "accordingly we use the transmission curve for kron - cousins r filter kpno w004 , first obtained in 1994 ; this may be the precise filter used in the original study . in any case ,",
    "after normalizing with this filter at @xmath90 , we take the model flux from each observation redshift , convert to the observed frame using the luminosity distance @xmath92 from our standard cosmology and convolve with the @xmath0 kpno 1586 transmission ( figure [ fig : filters ] ) to obtain the apparent magnitude .",
    "the resulting hubble diagram is shown in figure [ fig : hubble_diagram_all ] .",
    "for comparison we have also computed the @xmath46-band hubble diagram for this evolving model .",
    "the curve is quite close to @xcite s analytic approximation , although departures caused by the evolution are evident .",
    "hubble diagram computations with other evolving galaxy models yielded similar curves , with differences small compared to those introduced by uncertainty in the host absolute magnitude .    to compare with our measurements",
    ", we converted our model fit host counts ( in adu ) to @xmath0 magnitudes , including atmospheric @xcite and galactic @xcite extinction corrections .",
    "the establishment of the flux scale is discussed above (  3 ) , while the assumed galactic extinctions from the dust maps at the bl lac locations are listed in tables [ optic_results ] and [ minimo_results ] .",
    "finally , these host magnitudes ( and lower limits ) are converted to redshifts using our hubble diagram .",
    "of course the host absolute magnitude uncertainty translates into a range of possible redshifts .",
    "there are two contributions to the full redshift uncertainty .",

    "it is interesting to compare this with the _ hst _ host detections of @xcite ; in this study nearly all bl lacs at @xmath102 were resolved but only 6/23 sources with known @xmath103 yielded host detections . while at first sight it might seem surprising that a ground - based program could be competitive , it should be remembered that the _ hst _ snapshot bl lac survey observed with the f606w and f702w filters .",
    "the @xmath0 filter blue cut - on is @xmath104 nm redder than for the bulk of the _ hst _ observations , and so we do not expect to suffer appreciable surface brightness attenuation from the 4000 break until @xmath105 .",

    "indeed it may be no coincidence that the two objects with significant @xmath30 both have a large number of companions . while the upper limits on @xmath30 are in some cases constraining ,",
    "we conclude that with our modest ground - based resolution we can not in most cases probe the host structure .",
    "one arena where the comparison with hst - based measurements should be fairly robust is the host - nucleus flux ratio .",

    "this implies that the earth line - of - sight is even more nuclear component dominated ( on - axis ) than for the typical bl lac .",
