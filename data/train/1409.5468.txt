    "since star formation is an important process in the formation and evolution of galaxies , understanding what controls the conversion of gas into stars is essential .",
    "one of the key parameters in determining the rate of star formation ( sfr ) in any region should be the amount and nature of the gas available .",
    "our goal is to use surveys of the galactic plane to study the relation between gas and star formation on scales ranging from 1 to 200 pc , smaller than the scales accessible in studies of other galaxies .",
    "the study of the relation between gas mass and sfr goes back to the study of @xcite , who proposed a power law relation between sfr and the gas density .",
    "@xcite studied a set of galaxies and found a relation between the disk - averaged sfr surface density ( ) and gas surface density ( ) to be @xmath3 .",
    "since then , there have been many studies on the star formation relation in various types of galaxies , as reviewed by @xcite .    with improvements in instrumental resolution and sensitivity , it became possible to study the relation on smaller scales within individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "many studies used high - resolution data to study the relation down to sub - kiloparsec scales @xcite . star formation has been shown to be associated with molecular gas , rather than total gas @xcite , and the relations between  and  tend to be linear ( @xmath4 ) @xcite . while there is a strong correlation between gas mass and sfr surface density at disk - averaged scales , the relation showed a much larger scatter at smaller scales , suggesting that the star formation relation breaks down below a certain scale @xcite .",
    "the large scatter of the star formation relation on small scales implies that the relation does not arise simply from propagating the same relationship up from the scale of individual star forming regions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "currently , the extragalactic studies can resolve star forming regions down to sub - kiloparsec scales , with a few reaching scales of about 100 parsec @xcite .",
    "the relations seen in the extragalactic studies are measured on scales that are larger than individual molecular cloud . to understand the physics that underly the relation",
    ", one should look at an individual star forming region . to study",
    "star formation down to scales of an individual molecular cloud , we need to look at closer regions .",
    "studies of nearby molecular clouds ( distance@xmath5 kpc ) have found that star formation was highly concentrated to dense gas @xcite .",
    "where star formation happens , the star formation rate lies well above the relation for extragalactic regions , indicating that the extragalactic relation emerges from averaging over both star forming and non - star - forming gas .",
    "regions of high - mass star formation , more representative of what is probed in studies of other galaxies , are generally more distant and require techniques different from those used in the nearby clouds .",
    "studies of massive , dense regions indicated a linear relation between sfr and dense gas @xcite , similar to those found in other galaxies when tracers of dense gas , like hcn emission were used @xcite .",
    "the relation using tracers of dense gas also shows larger  at the same than found in extragalactic studies using all the molecular gas .",
    "extragalactic studies obtain star formation relations by looking at regions covering large areas of the galactic disk while star formation studies in the milky way have focused on individual star forming regions that were selected based on certain criteria .",
    "the regions studied by @xcite trace small , very dense regions , and they were selected to have signposts of massive star formation and thus may be biased . to bridge the gap between the galactic and extragalactic scales and to understand some of the differences in the extragalactic results , we need to study galactic star formation on larger scales and without the biases of previous studies .",
    "there have been many new large scale observations of the milky way in various wavelength bands .",
    "the spitzer legacy projects include the mipsgal @xcite and glimpse @xcite surveys , giving a view of the galactic plane in the infrared from 3.6  to 70 .",
    "all - sky surveys also provide information on star formation rates in the galactic plane ( e.g. , wise , @xcite ) . the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps ) observed the northern part of the galactic plane in 1.1 mm dust continuum ( @xcite , @xcite for version 2 of the data ) .",
    "the molecular gas distribution of the milky way was studied by @xcite in @xmath6co and by the galactic ring survey in @xmath7co @xcite , with both studies using the @xmath8 line . with these data available",
    ", we can study the relation in a larger area of the milky way and perform similar analysis on the galactic plane as in the extragalactic data and study how the change in resolution and the change in region selection method affect the result .",
    "understanding the effect of the change in resolution and selection methods will be useful in comparing between galactic and extragalactic studies .    in this paper",
    ", we used the 1.1 mm dust continuum data from the bgps survey as a molecular gas tracer and 22  emission from wise as a tracer of star formation to study the relation between gas mass and star formation for a part of the galactic plane .",
    "the details of the data used in this study are described in  [ data ] , and the data processing is described in  [ processing ] .",
    "we studied the relation between 1.1 mm and 22  emission by first looking at the pixel - by - pixel relation (  [ pixel ] ) and then by identifying separate sources inside the regions (  [ sourcebased ] ) .",
    "the discussion of the results is in  [ disc ] , and the results are summarized in  [ summary ] .",
    "dust emission has been used as a total gas tracer in previous studies by assuming that dust and gas are well - mixed @xcite .",
    "the correlation between gas and dust emission has also been studied by the co survey @xcite and the recent planck survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that dust emission is optically thin up to a column density of @xmath9 @xmath10 at 1 mm .",
    "it is also less sensitive to temperature than the fir emission . using dust opacities , a dust - to - gas ratio , and a typical dust temperature , we can estimate the gas mass .",
    "we used the 1.1 mm dust continuum from the bgps version 2 as a molecular gas tracer .",
    "the bolocam galactic plane survey covers about 170 deg@xmath11 in 1.1 mm continuum at an effective resolution of 33@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the 1.1 mm data span the range of galactic longitude of @xmath13 and galactic latitude of @xmath14 with additional coverage in some selected regions @xcite .",
    "extended sources were extracted from the 1.1 mm images to a catalog ( bolocat ) using a watershed decomposition algorithm @xcite .",
    "follow - up molecular line observations of the sources include hco@xmath15 @xmath16 , n@xmath17h@xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite , and nh@xmath18(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) inversion transitions @xcite .",
    "distances to a subset of the bolocat sources are also available @xcite .",
    "bolocat sources are relatively dense ( @xmath19 ) structures in molecular clouds with angular sizes of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "surveys by ground - based instruments at @xmath21 mm lose sensitivity to emission beyond some angular scale because it can not be separated from atmospheric emission variation .",
    "the bgps maps completely recover emission of up to 80  and partially recover emission to @xmath22 5   @xcite .",
    "these surveys thus pick out regions of characteristic _ volume _ densities , which depend on distance .",
    "@xcite calculated sizes and other properties of a subset of sources and characterized the bolocat sources as cores , clumps , and clouds , with size scales of order 0.1 pc , 1 pc , and 10 pc , respectively , depending on sources distances .",
    "as discussed later , the majority of the structures in the regions we study here correspond to relatively dense ( @xmath23 ) clumps within larger molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite extracted @xmath7co clouds associated with selected bgps sources with dense gas observations and compared the dust mass with the mass of the parent @xmath7co clouds . comparing a total mass of bgps sources inside gmcs with the mass of",
    "the gmc gave a median mass ratio of @xmath24 .",
    "if the mass was restricted to regions with mass surface density higher than 200  pc@xmath25 ) , the ratio decreased to 0.07@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the dense gas mass fraction does not appear to depend on cloud mass or cloud mass surface density .",
    "this result shows that the 1.1 mm sources occupy a only a small fraction of mass and volume within the clouds .",
    "the maps at 1.1 mm also have a smaller chance of source confusion along the line of sight than does co , which traces more extended emission from the less dense parts of molecular clouds .",
    "mid - infrared continuum emission has been used as a tracer of sfr .",
    "the mipsgal survey covers our target region in 24  mips band at a resolution of 6 .",
    "however , the saturation level is too low for the purpose of our large scale study .",
    "instead , we used the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) all - sky release images at 22  as a tracer of star formation .",
    "wise observed the entire sky in multiple exposures in four ir bands at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22  with a resolution of 12.0  at 22 .",
    "sfr(24 ) has been calibrated using the spitzer mips 24  band .",
    "the wise 22  band overlaps the mips 24  band with a slightly bluer response curve .",
    "the comparison between the two bands show that they are comparable @xcite .",
    "we considered the difference between measurements centered at 22  and those centered at 24  to be negligible , so use relations derived for 24  to calculate star formation rates .",
    "the 22  emission comes from dust heated by strong stellar radiation or from transiently - heated small dust grains @xcite .",
    "the bright emission peaks are expected to indicate dust concentrations that are heated by high mass stars .",
    "the 22  emission can then be used to trace the presence of high mass stars and so traces the current star formation activities .",
    "we used the 22  maps to study the relation between star formation activities and the gas distribution .    to convert the 22  emission to sfr however , a conversion factor or a calibration",
    "is needed .",
    "several studies calibrated a relation between mir and sfr using extragalactic data ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these calibrations were done on extragalactic scales assuming a fully - sampled imf and a long timescale of constant star formation .",
    "these assumptions are not always valid when applied to smaller scales or to regions with low mass or low sfr @xcite .",
    "the effect of stochastically sampling of the imf and the star formation history has been studied quantitatively by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they did not study the sfr measured from 24  emission explicitly , but they did study the sfr measured from the bolometric luminosity , which is the closest in sensitivities to the mid - infrared emission .",
    "these two tracers correlate closely @xcite .",
    "the sfr determined from the bolometric luminosity , assuming continuous star formation and an imf , has a scatter of 0.4 to 0.6 dex for sfr@xmath27  yr@xmath28 , and begins to systematically underestimate the actual sfr below @xmath29  yr@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that total infrared luminosity and 24   emission can underestimate sfr by more than an order of magnitude for molecular clouds with sfr@xmath30  yr@xmath28 .",
    "the effects of stochasticity get smaller as the total sfr of the region increases . for this work , 22  can underestimate the sfr on small scales and especially at low surface density but should trace sfr better when we look at larger scales , where we average over multiple star forming regions and toward bright regions with high surface density .",
    "the part of the galactic plane covered in this study includes a galactic longitude range of @xmath31 and galactic latitude range of @xmath32 , a total of 11 deg@xmath11 , divided into two equal size regions .",
    "both the 1.1 mm images from bgps version 2 and wise 22  images were combined into two separate mosaics using montage @xcite for the purpose of data analysis : region 1 at @xmath33 and region 2 at @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig : im ] shows 1.1 mm and 22  images for region 1 in the top two panels and region 2 in the third and forth panels . all the analysis described in the next section was performed similarly on images for the two regions .",
    "the results were then combined for further discussion .",
    "the two regions show sources with strong emission at 22 , including well - studied high mass star forming regions w41 and w42 in region 1 and w43 for region 2 @xcite .",
    "the end of the galactic bar should be near the end of region 2 at around l @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the 22  images show diffuse background emission that is not necessarily associated with recent star formation . the diffuse ( cirrus ) infrared emission within our galaxy",
    "has long been observed and studied @xcite .",
    "we constructed diffuse emission maps to facilitate removal of the diffuse background in the 22  images for photometry and for better comparison with the 1.1 mm images where large scale emission was automatically removed .",
    "the wise 22  images were convolved to a resolution of 33  and aligned to the bgps images , which were then used for estimating the diffuse emission maps . to capture the variations in the background , we adopted the following method .",
    "first , source areas were determined by selecting a 22  flux contour level that matched bright 22  emission areas when inspected by eye .",
    "all pixels inside source areas were masked as source pixels .",
    "second , the images were divided into smaller rectangular subgrids at a size of 200 by 200 pixels ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "iterative applications of chauvenet s rejection criterion were performed on each subgrid by iteratively applying a 3@xmath37 cut until all the remaining pixels are within 3@xmath37 of the average pixel value .",
    "the average of the remaining pixel values was then taken as the background value for the subgrid .",
    "finally , subgrids with fractions of the source area above a certain clipping threshold were omitted .",
    "the rest of the subgrid s background values were interpolated with a thin plate spline interpolation to create a final background image .",
    "this method gave a reasonable representation of the diffuse emission as seen in the original 22  images .",
    "we chose a source contour level , a grid size , and a clipping threshold that resulted in the closest approximation of the diffuse emission when inspected by eye .",
    "our method gives a diffuse background image that is similar to the method of @xcite .",
    "more detailed descriptions on the parameters chosen and the associated uncertainties are provided in appendix b , while the comparison between two background subtraction methods is provided in appendix c. the background - subtracted 22  images were used for the image convolution .",
    "the result of removing diffuse emission is shown in figure  [ fig : cirrus ] by comparing the fraction of the estimated diffuse emission to total emission as a function of surface brightness .",
    "the diffuse emission dominates the 22  flux at low surface brightness and contributes a considerable fraction up to a surface brightness of @xmath38 mjy sr@xmath28 where the diffuse emission accounts for 50% of the total emission , showing that removing diffuse emission is crucial .",
    "the original resolutions of the 1.1 mm and 22  images were 33  and 12  respectively .",
    "since we intended to study the relations between 1.1 mm and 22  at different scales , we first created a set of images at different spatial resolutions .",
    "this was done by convolving the images with a 2d gaussian profile of varying fwhm .",
    "both the 22  and 1.1 mm images at 33  resolution were convolved with a 2d gaussian kernel to resolutions of @xmath22 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 15 , and 20 .",
    "the scale of 20  was the largest scale we could achieve due to the limited coverage of galactic latitude in the bgps data .",
    "after the convolutions , the convolved images were binned to oversampling rates of @xmath22 10 pixels per beam s fwhm .",
    "figure  [ fig : im ] shows the 1.1 mm and 22  images at three resolutions : 33 , 10 , and 15 .",
    "the whole set of the convolved images was then used for further analysis .",
    "we identified regions with unreliable detections by estimating the sensitivity levels of both 1.1 mm and 22 maps .",
    "the sensitivity of the wise 22  images is very low compared to the average flux , and the uncertainty in source emission is dominated by the small scale variations in the diffuse background emission .",
    "we estimated the noise in the diffuse emission based on several sky regions in the image at 1  resolution .",
    "the average of the standard deviation of all the sky regions was taken as the 1-sigma value of the noise per pixel .",
    "the detection limits at other resolutions were estimated by assuming that the noise drops as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of pixels at 1  scale inside a resolution element .",
    "tests on the convolved images supported this assumption .",
    "the rms noise for the bgps 1.1 mm maps was estimated in @xcite over the range of the observed galactic longitude .",
    "the average rms noise in our targeted region ( @xmath41 ) is @xmath42 jy per pixel at the original pixel size of 7.2 .",
    "detection limits at other resolutions were estimated under the same assumption as for 22  images .",
    "with the complete set of both 1.1 mm and 22  images at various scales , we looked at the correlation between the two .",
    "rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the 1.1 mm and the 22  flux per pixel .",
    "rank correlation was used to look at the relation of the data since it is less sensitive to outliers and does not assume a linear relation .",
    "the result of the rank correlation coefficients versus resolutions is shown in figure  [ fig : pixcor ] .",
    "the blue dots represent data for region 1 while the red dots represent data for region 2 .",
    "the correlation coefficients for both regions increase rapidly as the scale increases until the scale of @xmath22 5 - 8 , above which they appear to be asymptoting to about 0.65 to 0.75 , depending on the region .",
    "while some differences between the two halves of the data exist , they do not seem large , so we combine the results from both regions in the rest of the paper .      with the 1.1 mm and 22  flux per pixel , we next converted them to molecular gas surface density ( ) and sfr surface density ( ) . since the surface densities are distance independent , we can use the entire regions for sampling data points .",
    "the sampling was done by binning the images so that each pixel was approximately equal to a resolution element .",
    "each pixel was then treated as a single data point .",
    "this method resulted in non - overlapping regions equal to the resolution size , covering the entire image , each with a corresponding 1.1 mm and 22  flux surface density .",
    "the mass surface density can be calculated from @xmath43 where @xmath44(1.1 mm ) is the 1.1 mm flux density , @xmath45 is the solid angle of a pixel , @xmath46 = 1.14 cm@xmath11 g@xmath28 is the dust opacity at 1.1 mm per dust mass ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) , and @xmath48 is the gas - to - dust mass ratio , taken to be 100 @xcite . assuming standard values and a dust temperature of 20 k for all sources yields @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the 1.1 mm flux density in jansky , and @xmath51 is the size of the region in arcsecond @xcite .",

    "we substituted the 22  flux for the 24  flux for the calculations .",
    "the resulting  and  for various spatial scales are shown in figure  [ fig : pixsfl ] .",
    "the figure shows the star formation relations as contour plots at each resolution .",
    "the contours represent number densities of data points of 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , and 80 data points at the binning of 0.2 in @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the same color represents the same number density in all the plots .",
    "the plot includes all data points with positive fluxes with the vertical and the horizontal dashed red lines representing detection ( 3-sigma ) limits for  and  respectively .",
    "naturally , the number of data points drops as the scale gets larger , and there are fewer pixels with values @xmath58 3-sigma .    the molecular depletion time is defined to be @xmath59  can be thought of as the timescale for all the molecular gas to be converted into stars at the current rate of star formation .",
    "the three dotted lines in figure  [ fig : pixsfl ] show lines of constant depletion time with  @xmath60 yr from top to bottom .",
    "the distribution of  provides a good measure of the scatter in the star formation relations .",
    "figure  [ fig : pixtdep ] shows the distributions of the log ( ) at various spatial scales , which include all the data points with positive fluxes .",
    "the dashed , blue line in each plot represents a gaussian fit to the distribution .",
    "the result shows that the average log ( ) is about @xmath61 , corresponding to 200 myr , independent of smoothing length , while the scatter , @xmath62 , decreases as the smoothing length increases .",
    "the distributions in figure  [ fig : pixtdep ] include many points below the detection limit . to account for the sensitivity issue , we assigned the 3-sigma detection values as upper limits of  and  for all the data points with values below the detection limits .",
    "data points with upper limits on both  and  were omitted from further analysis since most of them should be regions not involved in current star formation .",
    "table  [ tdep ] shows @xmath63 and @xmath64 estimated by three different methods . the first method ( fit )",
    "is the gaussian fit to the distributions of all the data points with positive fluxes before assigning upper limits as shown in figure  [ fig : pixtdep ] .",
    "the second method ( limit ) used the data including upper limit values of  and  to calculate the median and standard deviation of @xmath65 . the third method ( em ) used an expectation - maximization algorithm as described in @xcite to estimate the mean and standard deviation of a censored normal distribution .",
    "the em method is based on calculating the maximum likelihood estimates to a distribution assumed to be normally distributed .",
    "the data includes left - censored ( upper limit in ) and right - censored ( upper limit in ) data points .",
    "the uncertainties in the em method increase for data sets where large fractions of the data points are censored .",
    "the three methods give a comparable @xmath63 of about 8.3 regardless of the resolution scale ( table  [ tdep ] ) .",
    "they differ more regarding @xmath64 , but these differences disappear at larger smoothing scales .",
    "the pixel - by - pixel analysis provides a way to study the relation between  and  for an entire region without a need to extract sources from the images .",
    "this method was used in some extragalactic studies @xcite .",
    "however , the pixel - by - pixel analysis includes regions with low 22  and 1.1 mm surface densities that do not necessarily represent star formation .",
    "in addition , no information on distance is available .",
    "another approach to study the relation is to choose regions with strong emission , as was done by some extragalactic studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we started by looking at extracted sources from the bgps source catalog .",
    "these sources also have the advantage of having additional properties determined for a subset of them in previous studies such as distances , sizes , temperature , and densities .",
    "we started with the sources in the bgps catalog , describing the properties of sources in this sample (  [ bgpsprop ] ) and study the star formation relation (  [ bgpscat ] ) .",
    "then we considered what happens when we smoothed the images to larger scales , and extracted data centered on 1.1 mm peaks (  [ mmpeaks ] ) .",
    "finally , we compared these results to those obtained when we extracted data centered on 22  peaks (  [ irpeaks ] ) .",
    "the bgps source catalog ( bolocat ) provides sources extracted from the 1.1 mm images along with integrated source flux and flux inside aperture diameters of 40 , 80 , and 120 .",
    "these sources are possible sites of star formation , and they correspond to cores , clumps , or clouds depending on the distance @xcite . since 1.1 mm emission provides an unbiased tracer for dense molecular gas without a pre - selected criteria , bolocat gives a good set of sources for studying properties of potential star forming regions .",
    "distances are not available to all the bolocat sources , but kinematic distances to a subset of sources have been determined by @xcite using a bayesian distance probability distribution function to resolve the kinematic distance ambiguity in the inner galaxy .",
    "the distance catalog provides distances along with the uncertainties . in our targeted regions ,",
    "33% of the sources have distances .",
    "figure [ fig : dis ] shows the distance distribution for sources inside our targeted region , where the distances plotted are the maximum likelihood distances from @xcite .",
    "the shaded grey area represents a distance range inside which 90% of the total number of sources reside ( see  [ physscales ] ) .",
    "the subset of the sources with distances ( referred to hereafter as the distance catalog ) are generally representative of the entire bolocat source catalog .",
    "their distribution in galactic latitude is comparable to that of sources in the full catalog .",
    "however , the distance catalog is slightly biased toward sources with larger surface brightness with a median of 6.8 and 8.0 mjy sr@xmath28 for full catalog and distance catalog respectively ( see the full discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a fraction of 0.73 of the sources with distances are located in the 5 kpc peak ( between 0 - 7.5 kpc ) , and a fraction of 0.25 reside near the 10 kpc peaks ( between 8 - 14 kpc ) while a very small fraction of sources are at distances around 16 kpc .",
    "the mean of the distance is 5.9 kpc , the median is 5.1 kpc , and the standard deviation is 2.8 kpc . we will use the median value to calculate characteristic properties . at 5 kpc , 1 arcminute corresponds to 1.45 pc , and bgps sources correspond to clumps with typical densities of 10@xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the sources at 10 - 12 kpc are better characterized as clouds , with mean densities below 10@xmath67 .",
    "we started the investigation at the scale of individual bolocat sources by looking at the 22  emission from these sources .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the 22  images of 33  resolution at each of the bolocat source positions with an aperture radius of 40  to compare to the 1.1 mm bolocat flux of the same aperture size .",
    "the photometry resulted in a total of 1981 bolocat sources in the whole 11 deg@xmath11 region ; 738 of them have a 22  background - subtracted flux below the detection limit , a fraction of 0.37 .",
    "the photometric uncertainties were determined by combining the observational and poisson error from the wise uncertainty maps with the estimated random uncertainties in our method of background subtraction , the details of which can be found in appendix b.    we next calculated the sfr surface density from the 22  flux ( equation  [ eq : ssfr ] ) and molecular gas surface density from the 1.1 mm flux ( equation  [ eq : sh ] ) within an 80  aperture .",
    "the typical uncertainties are @xmath22 28% and 7% for  and  respectively .",
    "the uncertainties for  were determined from the calibration and photometric uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : bolocat_all ] .",
    "the contours show the source number density , as in figure  [ fig : pixsfl ] .",
    "the data have a large scatter , with a rank correlation coefficient between @xmath56 and @xmath57 of 0.40 .",
    "we assumed a power law relation of the form @xmath68 or equivalently @xmath69 a linear curve fit to the log data including the uncertainties in both axes using mpfitexy @xcite gave fitting parameters of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , as shown by the solid black line .",

    "emission shows a weak correlation with the 1.1 mm flux with a large scatter . from visual inspections ,",
    "the 22  emission in the whole region is more diffuse than the 1.1 mm emission .",
    "a lot of the 22  extended emission also does not coincide with the bolocat source contours . in this section",
    ", we studied how the correlation between sfr tracers and gas tracers changes when we look at the regions on larger scales .    using the images convolved to larger angular scales (  [ conv ] )",
    ", we identified the local peaks of the 1.1 mm emission .",
    "the local peaks were identified by locating pixels whose values are larger than all the adjacent pixels .",
    "overlapping regions were eliminated by dropping peaks with distances to the nearest peak less than the radius of the aperture .",

    "the aperture size was chosen to contain most of the source emission without applying aperture corrections .",
    "the same procedures were performed on the images convolved to resolutions of 10 , 15 , and 20 . once we go to higher fwhm , the angular source sizes increase , which corresponds to looking at larger physical areas . at a distance of 5 kpc ,",

    "we used procedures similar to those used in the 1.1 mm peaks analysis , but we started by identifying local emission peaks in 22  images at the resolution of 10 , 15 , and 20and performed photometry on both 1.1 mm and 22  images at locations of the 22  peaks . figure  [ fig : sfl](b ) shows the plot of the star formation relation at the three resolution scales .",

    "converting the angular scales to physical scales for our galactic plane data is different than for resolved extragalactic data since we are looking edge - on through the disk instead of face - on or nearly face - on .",
    "however , the available distances to a subset of the sources can be used to obtain some rough estimations of the physical size that corresponds to each angular resultion .",
    "about 33% of the bolocat sources in our targeted regions have distances measured with a distribution shown in figure  [ fig : dis ] @xcite . in estimating the physical scales , we assumed that the distance distribution of these sources is representative of the whole sample ( see  5.1 ) .",

    "the idea behind the method is to use source locations in galactic latitude and longitude to estimate the solid angle the sources subtend and use the distance distribution to estimate the range of distances for the sources .",
    "the result gives the volume subtended by the sources , which can be converted to a length scale .",
    "this would represent an upper limit to the relevant scale . to do this , first we binned the distance distribution with a binning size of 0.5 kpc as shown in figure  [ fig : dis ] .",
    "three values were chosen as source number density thresholds ( per bin ) so that the total number of sources above the thresholds account for about 80% , 90% , and 99% of the total sources .",

    "reduced to a sphere , the effective radius @xmath83 is @xmath84 the effective averaging scale , the diameter ( @xmath85 ) , at different resolutions is shown in figure  [ fig : size](a ) . using this estimation at the median distance @xmath86 of 5.1 kpc ,",
    "the angular resolution of 20  corresponds to an averaging scale of @xmath87 pc .",
    "a similar method was used to estimate the number of bolocat sources each resolution element contains .",
    "bolocat sources were mapped in the galactic coordinates , and a source number density map was created by counting number of sources inside bin sizes of 0.2@xmath88 in both axes .",
    "then 2d contours of source number density were drawn on the source number density map to contain approximately 80% , 90% , and 99% of the total number of sources .",
    "the total solid angle inside each contour gave a total area for each completeness value .",
    "the average number of sources per resolution element is the solid angle of the resolution element ( @xmath89 ) divided by the total area for the completeness value times the total number of sources .",
    "the average number of sources per resolution element is shown in figure  [ fig : size](b ) .",
    "for the larger smoothing lengths , we are typically averaging over 20 to 40 sources .",

    "the rank correlation coefficients between log ( ) and log ( ) increase from 0.40 at the bolocat source scale to 0.79 at 20  scale for sources based on 1.1 mm peaks .",

    "several possible sources of uncertainties in log  include observational and photometric uncertainties , uncertainties in the parameters assumed in calculating  and  , uncertainties in the 22  flux due to spatial offsets between 1.1 mm and 22  emission , and a scatter due to variations in intrinsic properties of the sources .",

    "the calibration was derived assuming a constant sfr on a timescale of 100 myr and a kroupa imf .",
    "when applied to an individual molecular cloud or a star forming region , the assumptions can not always be valid .",
    "the timescale assumed for constant star formation is much longer than the average lifetime of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "several studies show that infrared tracers underestimate sfr with large uncertainties in clouds with low mass or low sfr @xcite .",
    "the combined effects of stochastically sampling the imf and the star formation history causes sfr indicators such as h@xmath92 , fuv , and bolometric luminosity to under - estimate the sfr @xcite , and the size of the underestimate gets larger as the sfr gets smaller .",
    "@xcite also showed that when stochasticity is taken into account , sfr indicators do not provide a unique value of the sfr .",

    "all the data points are above the bias values for both pixel - by - pixel and source based results .",
    "the method of choosing regions also affects the uncertainty introduced by ir as a sfr tracer .",
    "pixel - by - pixel analysis is affected the most since the data contain regions with low  and low .",
    "regions chosen by identifying bright emission peaks will show less variations since these regions were chosen based on assumption of strong emission . therefore , sfr measurements from infrared tracers are more reliable when applied to regions with strong ir emission peaks as in figure  [ fig : irmm ] .",
    "for extragalactic studies , this effect will be more important in line - of - sight ( pixel - by - pixel ) studies than in studies with co , h@xmath92 , or ir peaks .",
    "the 1.1 mm emission comes from cold dust from dense molecular gas regions in gmcs while the 22  emission should be dominated by warmer dust heated by stellar radiation .",
    "the two emitting regions might not perfectly coincide spatially with each other .",
    "the sizes of the emitting regions could also be different for 1.1 mm and 22 .",
    "these two factors will result in spatial offsets , contributing to the scatter in the star formation relation if the scale size is smaller than a typical offset .",

    "this offset is typical of cloud sizes , consistent with the idea that the 1.1 mm source may be a remnant clump , while the infrared emission traces star formation in a now - destroyed clump in the same cloud",

    "these 1.1 mm sources are expected to be star forming regions .",
    "then these star forming regions should have variations in their properties .",
    "the sources that are in earlier stages of star formation would contain a large amount of gas and little infrared emission from star formation ( large ) , while the sources that are in later stages of star formation would contain less gas due to gas depletions and emit more strongly in the ir due to stars and current star formation ( small ) .",

    "we found similar results when comparing regions centered on 1.1 mm peaks with regions centered on 22  peaks .",
    "regions with strong 1.1 mm emission are more likely to be at an earlier stage of star formation where there is still a large amount of gas while regions with strong 22  have already formed stars .",
    "the differences in the average  between choosing different peaks shown in figure  [ fig : irmm ] support the hypothesis that the differences in the stage of star formation contribute to the large scatter in the star formation relation at small scales . +",

    "requires a careful modeling of how each source of scatter depends on scale , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "future studies of properties of individual star forming regions , especially their evolutionary stages , will provide more insights into the problem .      aside from looking at the scatter in the relation , we can also look for changes in the form of the star formation relation as the resolution is changed . while the correlation improves with averaging scale , the changes to the fitted values for the slope and intercept are not very significant .",

    "the pixel - by - pixel analysis does not show variations in the average  over resolution scales .",
