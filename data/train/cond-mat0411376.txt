    "the linear bath of harmonic oscillators is the most common model system to describe a quantum environment or bath , leading to dissipation and decoherence @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine an environment which is the simplest possible quantum - mechanical non - oscillator bath @xcite : a single two - level system subject to an oscillator bath .",
    "the effects of this nonlinear bath are analyzed by coupling it to a spin , whose relaxational dynamics under the action of the bath is studied by calculating spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "nonlinear baths have received a great deal of interest in the field of quantum computation , e.g. , in the context of superconducting devices @xcite and for spin - based proposals @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to define the border between system and bath in our total system .",
    "the first is to consider one two - level system to be the system and the other two - level system belonging to the bath .",
    "the bath consists then of a two - level system and the oscillators together and therefore it is a non - oscillator or nonlinear bath . studying",
    "the problem this way is relevant , since , in many physical situations where the precise nature of the bath decohering a given system is unknown , it is modeled as a linear bath , with some given correlation function .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to understand in more detail the kind and magnitude of possible errors introduced by such an approximation , in cases where the coupling can not be assumed to be weak .    the other way to define the system and bath is as follows : taken together , the two - level systems form a four - level system that is coupled to the linear oscillator bath .",
    "such systems of two two - level systems coupled to linear oscillator baths , representing a formidable problem in itself , have been studied in - depth using different methods , such as functional - integral approaches @xcite , master equations @xcite , and numerical calculations within the quasi - adiabatic propagator path integral method @xcite . in this work",
    "we use a different approach : the numerical flow - equation renormalization method .",
    "the flow - equation method itself was introduced by wegner @xcite and by glasek and wilson @xcite . using the flow - equation method one works in a hamiltonian framework .",
    "the whole procedure is non - perturbative , as it relies on a unitary transformation and has an energy - scale separation built in .",
    "the extension of the flow - equation formalism to dissipative systems was developed in refs .  , , and .",
    "the effective hamiltonian simplifies due to the fact that the coupling between bath and system disappears and equilibrium functions can be calculated easily . the method is non - perturbative , e.g. , neither a born nor markoffian approximation is applied , which is what makes it attractive and new .",
    "some drawbacks are that the flow equations for the observables are not closed , and a special ansatz is needed . here",
    ", we choose a linear ansatz , which works only for low temperatures smaller than the typical low - energy scale of the system hamiltonian .",
    "what is new in our work is that we apply the method to a general dissipative four - state system .",
    "the flow equations are designed to yield correlation functions for non - ohmic baths as well , which , as we will see below , makes it possible to treat the linear bath approximation to our nonlinear problem on the same footing . in refs .",
    ", , , , and , subohmic , superohmic , and a peaked structured environment , were studied with flow equations .",
    "similarly , the linear - bath approximation leads to a new peaked structured bath spectral density , to our knowledge , never studied before .",
    "the numerical integration of the flow equations allows us to study the nonlinear bath model by analyzing the spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "the numerical results are obtained at zero temperature .",
    "these results are then compared with those obtained from a linear bath with a non - ohmic bath spectral density .",
    "the bath spectral density is chosen in such a way that the linear bath leads to the same results as the original nonlinear bath in the limit of small enough system - bath coupling strength . the bath and system correlation functions",
    "are both calculated using flow equations . by carrying out the comparison ,",

    "the reason for this is that there are regions where a certain subset of the differential equations does not change much anymore and larger integration steps can be used , see discussion below .",

    "considered below , it turns out that the equilibrium correlator is given by the same expression as for the generator @xmath32 with high accuracy .",
    "if we choose the generator @xmath32 leading to the diagonal fixed - point hamiltonian @xmath44 , which is scale - independent , then , since no asymptotic scale is present , the flow equations will first decouple the high - energy modes and then the low - energy modes .",

    "this is why , in practice , all the differential equations outside of this region can be replaced by trivial ones in the program .",

    "it was observed that for a certain value of the flow parameter , the decoupled two - state system behaved like a dissipative harmonic oscillator .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that for the dissipative harmonic oscillator there exists a conserved quantity which could be added at a certain value of @xmath26 in order to complete the correlation function .",
    "another possible way to deal with this problem is to integrate to a large value of @xmath26 , such that the higher frequencies of the right peak are decoupled , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldep ] , and to continue the integration in a restricted frequency range with a higher resolution of the bath modes .",
    "finally , only a tiny gap is left which can then be closed by hand .    using the generator",
    "@xmath32 spikes appear around this singularity , which are due to the finite number of bath modes @xmath86 , i.e. , we assume that the phenomena will disappear for increasing @xmath86 . these spikes , generated via an amplifying effect , are not completely understood .",
    "probably , they occur always if the change in the correlation function happens too abruptly .",
    "this suggestion is motivated by the observation that the same feature appears , if the cutoff is chosen too close to the characteristic frequency of the system .",
    "there , we find that , due to the intrinsic properties of the differential - equation system , a spike appears at the cutoff frequency .",

    "the first main result of this work is the derivation of flow equations for a general dissipative four - level system . with this framework ,",
    "not only the correlation functions of our nonlinear bath model can be studied , but correlation functions for any four - state system coupled linearly to an oscillator bath .",
    "an additional key aspect is that there is no restriction for this bath to have an ohmic bath spectral density .    as an application of these general flow equations , a model of a nonlinear bath",
    "was discussed , consisting of a single two - level system subject to a linear oscillator bath .",
    "its effect on another two - level system at zero temperature has been analyzed and compared with the effect of a linear oscillator bath , many numerical results for various special cases have been obtained and discussed . for the flow equations of the nonlinear bath , two different generators have been used and the behavior of the corresponding flows has been analyzed .    for small system - bath coupling",
    "the equilibrium correlator contains only one peak which can be obtained using a markoff approximation .",
    "in contrast the linear bath can describe the second peak appearing for larger coupling strengths .",
    "at least two frequencies are therefore present in the time evolution of the two - state system , and furthermore , the decoherence is strongly increased if the system and bath are in resonance .",
    "as expected , the linear - bath approximation fails for the regime of large system - bath coupling . in that regime",
    "the linear bath may undoubtedly represent a good approximation to our actual nonlinear bath up to couplings on the order of half of the system energy scale . in the strong - coupling regime , on the order of the system energy scale , the agreement of the peak shapes is qualitatively better , when the bath spectrum has a strongly peaked structure . here , discrepancies between the linear and the original nonlinear bath became clearly visible .",
    "although we have only discussed the simplest example of a nonlinear bath , it is likely that the linear - bath approximation might lead to reasonable results in the intermediate - coupling regime , also for other , possibly more sophisticated systems .",
