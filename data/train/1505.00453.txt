    "<S> a major limitation of current acoustic metamaterials is that their acoustic properties are either locked into place once fabricated or only modestly tunable , tying them to the particular application for which they are designed . </S>",
    "<S> we present in this paper a design approach that yields active metamaterials whose physical structure is fixed , yet their local acoustic response can be changed almost arbitrarily and in real - time by configuring the digital electronics that control the metamaterial acoustic properties . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate experimentally this approach by designing a metamaterial slab configured to act as a very thin acoustic lens that manipulates differently three identical , consecutive pulses incident on the lens . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the slab can be configured to implement simultaneously various roles , such as that of a lens and beam steering device . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the metamaterial slab is suitable for efficient second harmonic acoustic imaging devices capable to overcome the diffraction limit of linear lenses . </S>",
    "<S> these advantages demonstrate the versatility of this active metamaterial and highlight its broad applicability , in particular to acoustic imaging .    </S>",
    "<S> acoustic metamaterials significantly expand our ability to manipulate sound by enabling material parameters that are not easily available in natural media , such as negative mass density , bulk modulus , and refractive index @xcite , as well as highly anisotropic @xcite and even unidirectional acoustic properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , they allow rigid materials to behave as regular fluids and are consequently suitable for robust devices for sound control . as a result , recent years have seen a remarkable development of new classes of metamaterials that are suitable for numerous applications , such as exotic sound cancellation @xcite and improved acoustic imaging devices @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the drawbacks of most reported metamaterials is that their functionality is locked into place once they are fabricated . </S>",
    "<S> there are scenarios where it is desirable to tune their properties dynamically as needed rather than building a new device for each particular application . </S>",
    "<S> there are currently only a few designs that promise to address this limitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , recent advances on active metamaterials employing electronic circuits in their structure provide a natural path towards tunable metamaterials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other approaches involve the use of variable magnetic fields to control the properties of pre - stretched membranes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these designs merely tweak a particular material parameter in a relatively narrow range </S>",
    "<S> . it would be advantageous to change entirely the metamaterial functionality in a dynamic manner .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in this paper that active acoustic metamaterials provide an ideal platform to design versatile media whose acoustic properties are easily configured dynamically . to demonstrate this concept , we fabricate a metamaterial slab and demonstrate the following two features . </S>",
    "<S> first , its functionality can be set in real - time without changing the physical structure of the slab . </S>",
    "<S> second , it can implement acoustic properties not easily available in metamaterials designed through other methods . </S>",
    "<S> acoustic imaging is a promising area of application for acoustic metamaterials @xcite , therefore the experimental illustration of the benefits of our design method will have these applications in mind . more specifically , to prove the first point we send a plane wave consisting of three modulated gaussian pulses coming in quick succession , and configure the slab to act as an acoustic lens whose properties are changed rapidly so that each pulse is manipulated differently .    to demonstrate the second point , we configure the slab to play simultaneously two different roles , namely that of a beam steering device and focusing lens . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we show how very small f - numbers of less than 0.5 are possible in a very thin lens whose thickness is less than a tenth of the wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we use this opportunity to demonstrate experimentally an idea first presented in the context of electromagnetic metamaterials , namely that imaging using higher order harmonics of the incident field can beat the diffraction limit associated with linear devices .    </S>",
    "<S> the metamaterial unit cell follows the general architecture described in refs . . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a three terminal piezoelectric membrane produced by murata inc . </S>",
    "<S> augmented by electronics , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unit cell]a . </S>",
    "<S> the incident sound is sampled by the membrane s sensing terminal , which creates an electric signal proportional to the acoustic excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the signal is amplified in a pre - amplifier of gain @xmath0 and passes through a bandpass filter of bandwidth 20% centered on frequency @xmath1 hz . </S>",
    "<S> it then enters a block of reconfigurable electronics that essentially determines the metamaterial functionality . </S>",
    "<S> since the focus here is on second harmonic imaging applications , one of the functions of this stage is to create the second harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting signal passes through a second bandpass filter of bandwidth 20% centered on @xmath2 hz , and it is further amplified ( gain @xmath3 ) and drives the main terminal of the piezoelectric membrane , thus creating the acoustic response of the cell . to increase cell repeatability and the overall flexibility of the system , </S>",
    "<S> the bandpass filters together with the reconfigurable electronics are implemented digitally in a digital signal processor ( dsp ) produced by atmel ( sam3x8e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cell functionality is thus set by uploading various programs into the dsp .        </S>",
    "<S> to better match acoustically the piezoelectric membrane to the surrounding environment , the membrane is mounted between two identical helmholtz cavities made of plexiglas and designed according to the membrane manufacturer recommendations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , each cavity has a height 3.2 mm , a circular cross section of diameter 33 mm , and end with an opening whose diameter is 6 mm . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : unit cell]b shows a photo of the metamaterial unit cell , and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unit cell]c presents a metamaterial slab composed of ten identical unit cells .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to leverage the flexibility afforded by the reconfigurable electronics block and change the metamaterial functionality without changing its physical structure . </S>",
    "<S> the first application is to configure the slab to act as an acoustic metamaterial lens ( aml ) that images a distant object by focusing the plane wave incident on it into a focal spot in the lens vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done using passive materials and various techniques @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the configurability feature of this design method by changing the lens parameters , namely focal length and direction of the focused beam , in real - time as the incident wave hits the lens .    </S>",
    "<S> the acoustic behavior of the aml is characterized experimentally inside a two - dimensional ( 2d ) acoustic waveguide composed of two square parallel plastic sheets 120 cm long and separated by 5 cm . </S>",
    "<S> the latter dimension coincides with the metamaterial unit cell size . </S>",
    "<S> a top - view schematic of the waveguide showing the lens placed in the middle is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : experimental setup]a . </S>",
    "<S> a plane wave is obtained inside the waveguide using an array of 12 in - phase speakers placed on the left edge of the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the plane wave consists of three identical gaussian pulses modulated by a sinusoid at 1500 hz separated by  13 ms . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the wave is sketched in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : experimental setup]a , and its time domain evolution at the aml position is given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : experimental setup]b . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose is to reconfigure the lens in between the pulses so that the lens behavior is different for each pulse . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the target aml parameters for the three pulses are given by the pairs ( 30 cm , 30@xmath4 ) , ( 20 cm , -30@xmath4 ) , and ( 30 cm , 0@xmath4 ) , respectively , where the first parameter of the pair is the focal length , and the second is the angle that the focused beam makes with the horizontal .        </S>",
    "<S> the fields on the transmission side of the aml are measured using a microphone that scans the waveguide interior on a square grid of points separated by 2 cm in both the horizontal and vertical directions . to obtain a visually more pleasing image of the fields , the measurements are spatially interpolated to double the number of sampled points in each directions . </S>",
    "<S> a typical measurement is shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : experimental setup]a to illustrate the scanned area relative the the lens position .    </S>",
    "<S> acoustic lenses can be realized in several ways . </S>",
    "<S> for example , curved surfaces @xcite could be used to transform the incident acoustic field into a converging field . </S>",
    "<S> gradient - index metamaterials could achieve the same effect by varying the delay of the acoustic wave as it propagates through various parts of a flat lens @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we employ here the latter idea . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of delaying the incident wave inside the material itself we engineer the delay in electronics . </S>",
    "<S> this approach addresses two inherent limitations of passive designs , namely lenses can be made much thinner than through other methods and the focal distance and , consequently , their f - number can be made remarkably small .    the functionality of the reconfigurable electronics block is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : real - time reconfigurable ] . </S>",
    "<S> a rectifier block generates the second harmonic used in the imaging process . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting signal is delayed in a delay line implemented in the dsp as a first - in - first - out queue . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of delay is proportional to the length of the queue , and is changed in real - time to implement the target functionality specified above . for the particular application described above , the phase delay for each metamaterial element indexed by variable @xmath5 can be easily determined from the time needed by the acoustic energy to propagate between each element and the focal point at the central angular frequency , @xmath6 , and it is given by    @xmath7 ^ 2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the focal length , @xmath9 is the angle of the focused beam , @xmath10 is a constant big enough to make all @xmath11 positive , @xmath12 m / s is the speed of sound , and @xmath13 cm is the metamaterial periodicity .        the supplemental movie @xcite shows the acoustic response of the slab to the three - pulse plane wave presented in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : experimental setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : real - time reconfigurable]b - d shows three representative frames separated by 13 ms that highlight the response of the lens for each pulse . in each case , we note the clear convergent fields emerging from the lens , the focal spot marked on each panel , and the focused beam leaving the scene in the designed direction , which confirm the desired functionality . </S>",
    "<S> the only deviation from the expected theoretical behavior is the side lobe visible in figure [ fig : real - time reconfigurable]d and caused by the multiple reflections of the incident wave in the area between the lens and the speaker array .    </S>",
    "<S> d. the dotted line marks the focal plane . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) , comparison between the field measured on the focal plane ( circles ) and an ideal lens imaging at the second harmonic ( dotted curve ) and the fundamental ( solid curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second harmonic image is twice narrower than the image at the fundamental frequency.,width=302 ]    these measurements emphasize the advantage of using higher order harmonics in imaging systems , namely the focal spot is considerably smaller than what can be obtained with regular , linear systems . to quantify the size of the focal spot , we present in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : amplitude field]a the field amplitude at the second harmonic frequency of 3000 hz measured for the lens response to the second plane wave pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the field amplitude measured along the focal plane is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : amplitude field]b as the circles marked curve and matches very well the theoretical prediction ( dotted curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the image at the frequency of the incident field produced by an ideal linear lens having the same size and focal distance as the metamaterial lens , i.e. the diffraction limit , is shown using the continuous curve . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the width of the measured image is approximately twice narrower than what is normally obtained in a linear system , in agreement with previous results reporting second harmonic imaging in the electromagnetic regime @xcite .    in the above example </S>",
    "<S> , we showed how the active metamaterial can change functionality in real - time . </S>",
    "<S> next , we show how it can be configured to serve multiple roles at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate this idea , suppose we have a beam steering device that takes an incident beam and steers it to a different direction . without disturbing this functionality , </S>",
    "<S> we want to monitor the quality of the beam by focusing it and measuring its characteristics using a microphone placed at the focal spot .    </S>",
    "<S> the double functionality is implemented in the reconfigurable electronics blocks as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multiplexing functionality]a . the beam steering and focusing behavior </S>",
    "<S> is implemented using two delay lines implemented as before using first - in - first - out queues in the dsp . </S>",
    "<S> the signals leaving the queues are added and drive the metamaterial cell piezoelectric transducer that generates the cell acoustic response .    </S>",
    "<S> b. ( c ) metamaterial configured to behave as a beam steering device . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) metamaterial configured to behave as a focusing lens and beam steering device simultaneously.,width=321 ]    the functionality implemented in the first delay line is that of a lens characterized by parameters ( 30 @xmath14 ) , also used in the previous example . </S>",
    "<S> the beam steering functionality is obtained using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lens equation ] ) and parameters @xmath15 . to verify the correct behavior of each individual delay queue , we activated them individually and measured the acoustic response of the metamaterial slab to an incident plane wave . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig : multiplexing functionality]a and [ fig : multiplexing functionality]b show the intended behavior of a lens and , respectively , beam steering device . by activating both delay lines </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the linear superposition of the two behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the plane wave and focused beams leaving the metamaterial slab are virtually identical to the beams of the basic devices whose functionality is combined , and confirm the excellent ability of the metamaterial slab to behave as two different devices at the same time .    </S>",
    "<S> we presented an active metamaterial design approach in which the effective material properties are set in reconfigurable digital electronic blocks and demonstrated the approach experimentally for a slab composed of ten unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> the design method features four main advantages over other acoustic metamaterial design methods . </S>",
    "<S> first , the material properties can be changed instantaneously to the desired values , which implies that metamaterials can be configured in real - time to have various behaviors depending on application without changing their physical structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the slab was configured to individually manipulate three identical , closely spaced short pulses . </S>",
    "<S> second , the metamaterial can be configured to play multiple roles at the same time . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , the metamaterial was configured to simultaneously behave as a beam steering device and focusing lens . </S>",
    "<S> third , the design approach is suitable for non - linear imagining applications in which the device responds with higher order harmonics of the incident field . </S>",
    "<S> this is advantageous because it results in sharper images that do not obey the diffraction limit of linear systems . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the metamaterial response is controlled almost entirely by electronics as opposed to the metamaterial geometry , which implies that it is now possible to obtain imaging devices much thinner than what is feasible with other methods . in one of the applications , </S>",
    "<S> the fabricated metamaterial slab was configured to behave as a lens a tenth of a wavelength thick and had an f - number below 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> these advantages demonstrate the versatility of the active metamaterial design procedure and recommend it to numerous applications . </S>"
