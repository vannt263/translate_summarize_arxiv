    "be stars are rapidly rotating b - type stars that manage to eject gas into a circumstellar disk ( observed in h emission lines , an ir excess flux , and linear polarization ; @xcite ) .",
    "be star disks are ephemeral and vary on timescales from days to decades ( in some cases disappearing altogether for extended periods ) .",
    "this inherent time variability suggests that gas injection into the disk is only partially the result of the fast spin and equatorial extension of the be star @xcite and that magnetic , pulsational , wind driving , and/or other processes are required for mass loss into the disk @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary status of be stars is still a subject of considerable debate @xcite , but there is growing evidence that many be stars were spun up through mass transfer from a binary companion that has since become a neutron star , white dwarf , or hot subdwarf @xcite .",
    "the direct resolution of be star disks has come through high resolution radio observations ( @xmath7  per ; @xcite ) and long baseline interferometry in a narrow band around the h@xmath5 emission feature @xcite .",
    "the first h@xmath5 studies focused on the bright , northern sky be stars @xmath1  cas @xcite and @xmath3  tau @xcite . in a seminal paper ,",
    "@xcite presented results for seven be stars based upon narrow - band h@xmath5 observations made with the mkiii interferometer at mount wilson observatory .",
    "they were able to resolve the disks around all seven stars , and they found diameters in the range @xmath8  mas ( gaussian fwhm ) . in most cases",
    "the visibilities indicated an elongated shape ; for example , in the case of @xmath3  tau , the major axis was resolved  ( 4.53  mas diameter ) but the orthogonal minor axis remained unresolved , consistent with the suggestion that we are viewing the disk almost edge - on .",
    "the disk orientation position angle on the sky inferred from polarimetry matched the interferometric results in every case .",
    "these results have been extended and improved through new interferometric observations with the navy prototype optical interferometer ( npoi ) in an important series of papers by tycner and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the relative flux contribution from the disk becomes larger in the infrared spectral range due to bound - free and free - free emission from the dense and ionized gas in the disk .",
    "@xcite developed a disk model for the ir emission that he subsequently applied to determine the disk properties of 101 be stars based upon their far - ir emission observed with the _ iras _ satellite @xcite , and @xcite further extended this analysis to study the near - ir excess in 144 be stars .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the near - ir flux excess is correlated with the h@xmath5 emission strength in be stars as expected for a common origin in the disk .",
    "thus , the near- and mid - ir ranges @xcite offer a new opportunity for resolving the disks of be stars through long baseline interferometry .",
    "@xcite presented a wind model for the infrared emission from be stars and the corresponding interferometric visibilities for the models .   their model for @xmath1  cas , for example ,",
    "predicts that the disk should appear approximately two times larger in the @xmath9-band continuum and in the br@xmath1 emission line than found by narrow - band h@xmath5 interferometry .",
    "@xcite made additional predictions for 16 be stars of the expected @xmath9-band interferometric visibilities .",
    "the first attempt to resolve the infrared disk flux was recently made by @xcite who made @xmath10-band observations with the vlti / midi instrument of the bright southern be star @xmath5  ara , and their results indicate that the disk is smaller than that predicted by @xcite , perhaps due to disk truncation by a faint binary companion .",
    "@xmath9-band interferometric observations from vlti / vinci of @xmath5  ara were reported by @xcite who interpreted the visibilities using a rotationally distorted photospheric model .",
    "here we present the first near - ir interferometric observations of four bright , northern sky be stars that we obtained with the georgia state university center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array at mount wilson observatory @xcite .",
    "we describe the interferometric and complementary spectroscopic observations in  2 and then we present a simple disk model in  3 that we use to predict the interferometric visibilities and spectral line profiles .",
    "we discuss the specific results for each of the four targets in  4 .",
    "our results are summarized in  5 .",
    "we selected four well known be stars for this initial program of chara array interferometry : @xmath1  cas ( hr  264 = hd   5394 = hip  4427 ) , @xmath2  per ( hr  496 = hd  10516 = hip  8068 ) , @xmath3  tau ( hr  1910 = hd  37202 = hip  26451 ) , and @xmath4  dra ( hr  4787= hd  109387 = hip  61281 ) .",
    "all the targets except @xmath4  dra have prior narrow - band h@xmath5 interferometric observations @xcite .",
    "the first three stars were targets in speckle interferometric searches for close companions , and no such companions were detected @xcite ; however , oscillations in the the proper motion of @xmath1  cas suggest the presence of a faint companion with a period of some 60  y @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "all four of the targets are known spectroscopic binaries with periods in the range 61 ",
    "204  d. the companion in the case of @xmath2  per is a hot subdwarf whose spectral features appear in the uv spectrum @xcite , but for the other three stars the nature of the low mass companion is unknown .",
    "we summarize the adopted parameters for the target stars in table  1 that lists the spectral classification , parallax @xcite , radius , mass , effective temperature , and projected rotational velocity @xcite of the bright primary star .",
    "the next three rows give the radius , mass , and effective temperature of the secondary .",
    "these are only known for @xmath2  per and representative values are listed for the others assuming that they also have hot subdwarf companions ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "the next four rows list the binary period , epoch of the secondary star s maximum radial velocity ( equal to the epoch of the secondary s crossing of the ascending node ) , the primary star to center of mass portion of the semimajor axis , and the adopted roche radius of the primary star .",
    "the final row provides a key to the references from which these various parameters were adopted .",
    "the chara array observations were made on various dates during the first two years of operation ( table  2 ) .",
    "the telescope , instrumentation , and data reduction procedures are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the chara array consists of six 1  m telescopes in a @xmath11-configuration with pairwise baselines ranging from 34 to 330  m in length .",
    "the be star observations were primarily made with intermediate to long baseline configurations using the @xmath0 filter described by @xcite .",
    "a summary of each night s observations is given in table  2 that lists the target and calibrator star names , the telescope pair ( with the maximum baseline given in meters in parentheses ; @xcite ) , the ut date , and the number of sets of measurements .",
    "we made the measurements using the `` chara classic '' beam combiner , which is a two - beam , pupil - plane ( or michelson ) combiner @xcite .",
    "the fringes were recorded with a near - ir detector on either 1 or @xmath12 pixels at a sampling rate of 100 or 150 hz depending on the seeing conditions .",
    "the path length scans were adjusted to obtain approximately five samples per fringe spacing .",
    "each measurement set consists of some 200 scans of the fringe pattern with photometric calibration scans performed before and after .",
    "the raw visibilities were estimated from an edited set of scans using the log - normal power spectrum method described by @xcite .",
    "we transformed the raw visibilities into absolute visibility @xmath13 by interleaving the target observations with measurements of calibrator stars with small angular diameters @xcite .",
    "the calibrator stars are generally close in the sky and of comparable @xmath0 magnitude to the targets , and we list in table  3 their effective temperatures and gravities as derived by other investigators ( identified in column 7 ) .",
    "we estimated the angular diameters of the calibrator stars by comparing their observed and model flux distributions .",
    "the angular diameter of the limb darkened disk @xmath14 ( in units of radians ) is found by the inverse - square law : @xmath15 where the ratio of the observed and emitted fluxes ( reduced by the effects of interstellar extinction @xmath16 ) depends on the square of the ratio of stellar radius @xmath17 to distance @xmath18 .",
    "most of the calibrator stars are relatively close by and the interstellar extinction is negligible .",
    "the one exception is hd  107193 , and in this case we adopted an extinction curve law from @xcite that is a function of the reddening @xmath19 and the ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath20 ( set at a value of 3.1 ) .",
    "the model fluxes were interpolated from the grid of models from r.  l.  kurucz based upon the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in table  3 .",
    "these model fluxes are based upon solar abundance , plane - parallel , local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , line blanketed atmospheres with a microturbulent velocity of 4 km  s@xmath23 that should be adequate for these a- and f - type main sequence stars .",
    "we compiled data on the observed fluxes from the optical to the near - ir .",
    "we found johnson @xmath24 photometry for all the calibrators , and these magnitudes were transformed to fluxes using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "we also included strmgren photometry for several calibrators using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "spectrophotometry from @xcite was used for hd  6210 .",
    "all of the stars are included in the _",
    "2mass all - sky catalog of point sources _",
    "@xcite , and we converted the @xmath25 magnitudes to fluxes using the calibration of @xcite . in a few cases the errors in the _ 2mass _ magnitudes were unacceptably large , and we relied instead on ir fluxes from the _ cobe _ dirbe instrument @xcite .",
    "the angular diameters we derived by fitting the spectral energy distributions are given in column  6 of table  3 .",
    "most of these calibrators have angular diameters that are small enough that their associated errors will introduce only minor systematic errors in our derived target angular sizes @xcite .",
    "it is normal practice in interferometry to estimate the actual visibility of a calibrator by adopting a uniform disk function for the visibility curve as a function of wavelength and baseline , but in fact it is no more difficult to apply a visibility curve for a limb darkened disk provided the form of the limb darkening is known @xcite .",
    "we used the effective temperatures and gravities from table  3 to estimate the @xmath9-band limb darkening coefficients from the tables of @xcite , and then we calculated the limb darkened visibility curves for the calibrators ( for the projected baseline at the time of observation and the limb darkened angular diameter given in table  3 ) by making a weighted sum of the predicted visibilities over the wavelength band of the @xmath0 filter ( to account for bandwidth smearing ) .",
    "we then made a simple linear interpolation in time between the target and calibrator observations to estimate the ratio of raw to absolute visibility required to transform the results to absolute visibility .",
    "note that we also made a spline fit of the time evolution of calibrator visibility , and the difference between the spline and linear interpolated visibilities was added quadratically to the error budget for the final calibrated visibility to help estimate the errors introduced by the time interpolation scheme .",
    "the calibrated visibilities are presented in table  4 ( available in full in the electronic version of the paper ) .",
    "the columns in this table give the target name , the heliocentric julian date of the mid - point of the data set , the binary orbital phase determined from the period and epoch given in table  1 , the telescope pair used for the observation , the projected baseline and position angle of the target as viewed from the telescope pair at the mid - point time , and the calibrated visibility .",
    "note that the visibility errors quoted represent the internal errors from the power spectrum analysis of the fringes plus a term introduced for the calibration process , and these may underestimate the actual visibility errors .",
    "we find , for example , that there are some closely spaced observations on certain nights with comparable projected baselines and position angles that have a scatter that is several times larger than the formal errors .",
    "there are 11 such subsets of 4 or more measurements from within a specific night that have ranges of @xmath26  m and @xmath27 , and the average ratio of the standard deviation of @xmath13 within a subset to the mean of the quoted internal error in @xmath13 is a factor of 2.8 .",
    "thus , the quoted errors are probably lower limit estimates of the true error budget .",
    "the disks of be stars exhibit large temporal variations in their h - balmer emission strengths that presumably reflect large structural changes in their geometry and/or density @xcite .",
    "thus , we obtained new spectroscopic observations of the target be stars in order to compare the balmer emission levels at times contemporaneous with the interferometric observations .",
    "the sources and details of the spectroscopy are listed in table  5 that reports the observatory and telescope of origin , the spectroscopic instrument , spectral resolving power @xmath28 , spectral range recorded , ut dates , and the names of targets .",
    "most of the observations of the h@xmath5 and h@xmath1 lines were made with the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) coud feed telescope , and these have moderate resolution and high s / n properties .",
    "the h@xmath5 spectra of @xmath4  dra were obtained at both the university of toledo ritter observatory and the ondejov observatory at the same time as the first chara array observations were made , and a low dispersion blue spectrum was also obtained at that time with the university of texas mcdonald observatory 2.7  m telescope ( recording h@xmath29 through the higher balmer sequence ) .",
    "all of these spectra were reduced using standard routines in iraf to create continuum rectified versions of each spectrum .",
    "the atmospheric telluric lines in the vicinity of h@xmath5 were removed from the kpno coud feed spectra @xcite , but these features were quite weak in the @xmath4  dra h@xmath5 spectra and were left in place .",
    "we describe these balmer line profiles in  4 and  5 below .",
    "the ir excess flux from be star disks will tend to dilute the photospheric and emission lines in the near - ir spectral range , and the strength of the br@xmath1 emission line in particular offers a sensitive test of the ir excess fluxes derived from interferometry .",
    "thus , we also obtained low resolution @xmath9-band spectroscopy of all the targets except @xmath4  dra with the university of texas mcdonald observatory 2.7  m telescope and coolspec spectrometer @xcite .",
    "we used a @xmath30 entrance slit and a grating with 75 grooves mm@xmath23 in second order , yielding a spectral resolving power of @xmath31 ( table  5 ) .",
    "the detector was a nicmos3 hgcdte @xmath32 pixel array .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the methods described by @xcite except that in our case the sky background was estimated from the intensity at off - star positions along the projected slit .",
    "we also made a number of spectra at different air masses of the broad - lined , a0  v stars hr  567 ( hd  11946 ) and hr  2398 ( hd  46553 ) , which we used to remove the numerous atmospheric features in this spectral band .",
    "the stellar spectra of these two stars are essentially featureless with the exception of the photospheric br@xmath1 line @xcite , and we formed pure atmospheric spectra by dividing our observed spectra by the average stellar spectra of the similar stars hr  5793 and hr  7001 ( after broadening for the lower resolution of our spectra and for the higher projected rotational velocities of hr  567 and hr  2398 ) that we obtained from the spectral library of @xcite .",
    "the target spectra were then divided by these atmospheric spectra ( after small line depth corrections to account for differing air masses ) to obtain the final continuum rectified versions that are presented below (  5 ) .",
    "the observed interferometric visibilities can be interpreted by assuming that the be star disks have a relatively simple spatial intensity in the sky , perhaps a uniform ellipsoid , ring , or gaussian ellipsoid @xcite . however , the quality of the interferometric data is sufficient to begin to explore more physically motivated models for the disk appearance . here",
    "we present a relatively simple model for the near - ir emission that is derived from the be circumstellar disk model of @xcite .",
    "the advantages of this approach are that we can compare the resulting disk gas densities with prior work on the near - ir spectrum and that we can also predict the disk emission line strengths for comparison with our observed spectra . in the following subsections we outline the basic assumptions and characteristics of the model that we then apply to fit the chara array observations of visibility .",
    "we discuss the model predictions for spectroscopy below in  4 .",
    "@xcite present a simple model for the circumstellar disks of be stars that they use to explore the emission line shapes .",
    "the basic concept is that the disk is axisymmetric and begins at the stellar surface .",
    "the gas density in the disk is given by @xmath33\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the radial and vertical cylindrical coordinates ( in units of stellar radii ) , @xmath36 is the base density at the stellar equator , @xmath37 is a radial density exponent , and @xmath38 is the disk vertical scale height .",
    "this gas scale height is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the sound speed and @xmath41 is the keplerian velocity at the stellar equator .",
    "we assume that the outer boundary of the disk occurs at a radius @xmath42 that is equal to the roche radius of the be star for these four binary targets ( table  1 ) .",
    "this assumption is probably more critical for the mid - ir emission spectrum , but it not important for the @xmath0 emission that is generally confined to regions well within the roche radii of our targets .",
    "@xcite assume that the temperature is constant throughout the disk and is given by @xmath43 where @xmath21 is the stellar effective temperature .",
    "in fact , recent physical models for be disks by @xcite show that the gas temperature is actually a function of both @xmath34 and @xmath35 , but their work shows that the temperature is about @xmath44 in the outer , optically thin parts of the disk , so we adopt this value for the isothermal approximation used here .",
    "we assume that the star itself is spherical and of uniform brightness in the @xmath0 band .",
    "neither of these assumptions is probably correct for a rotationally distorted and gravity darkened be star @xcite , but the photospheres of the targets are small enough ( see table  6 below ) that these details are inconsequential for the baselines and wavelength of the chara array observations .",
    "we suppose that the disk is observed with the disk normal oriented to our line of sight with an inclination angle @xmath45 and a position angle @xmath5 measured east from north in the sky .",
    "note that this position angle convention is @xmath46 different from that adopted in the h@xmath5 interferometric studies where the position angle of the projected major axis is usually given .",
    "thus , the four parameters that define a disk model are the base density @xmath36 , the density exponent @xmath37 , and the orientation angles @xmath45 and @xmath5 .",
    "we determine the surface brightness of the disk plus star over a projected rectilinear coordinate grid on the sky by solving the equation of transfer along a ray through the center of each grid position , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the derived specific intensity , @xmath49 is the source function for the disk gas ( taken as the planck function for the disk temperature @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 is the specific intensity for a uniform disk star ( taken as the planck function for @xmath21 ) , and @xmath52 is the integrated optical depth along the ray . the main shortcoming in this expression is the neglect of a scattered light term to account for thomson scattering of photospheric intensity ( see , for example , eq .  [ 6 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "for the typical electron densities that we find for our be star targets , this term will amount to only a few percent of the stellar specific intensity at locations close to the star , which is usually much less than the disk source function in the optical thick portions , so this simplification is acceptable in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the disk optical depth in the near - ir is predominantly due to bound - free and free - free processes , and we can express the increment in optical depth with an incremental step @xmath53 along a given ray as @xmath54 where the coefficient @xmath55 is given by equation ( 5 ) in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this coefficient includes terms for the gaunt factors for bound - free and free - free emission that we evaluated for the @xmath0 band using the tables in @xcite .",
    "we adopted an ionization model for the disks of the two hotter be stars , @xmath1  cas and @xmath2  per , that assumed ionized h , singly - ionized he , and doubly - ionized c , n , and o atoms , while for the cooler be stars , @xmath3  tau and @xmath4  dra , we assumed ionized h , neutral he , and singly ionized c , n , and o. note that we evaluated the optical depth coefficient only at the central wavelength of the @xmath0 filter since the coefficient varies slowly with wavelength . also note that we have accounted only for continuum emission in this band since the br@xmath1 emission contribution is small compared to the flux integrated over the @xmath0 band (  5 ) .",
    "the image of the be star in the sky in constructed by integrating the optical depth along each ray according to equations ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , and then populating each pixel of the image using equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the pixel scale on the sky is set by the adopted angular diameter of the star ( derived from the parallax and radius in table  1 ) .",
    "we show an example calculation for @xmath1  cas in the left panel of figure  1 .",
    "portions of the disk projected against the sky include only the first term of equation ( 4 ) , and the disk intensity attains a maximum of @xmath56 in the inner optically thick regions . at a radius",
    "where the optical depth is approximately unity , the disk becomes optically thin and fades with increasing radius .",
    "part of the background disk is occulted by the star while the part in foreground attenuates the photospheric intensity .",
    "we also include a binary star option to add the disk of a secondary into the image at a position appropriate for the time of observation .",
    "the interferometric visibilities are then calculated by making fourier transforms of such disk images , and we did this following the techniques described by @xcite .",
    "the comparison with the observed visibility is done by determining the discrete fourier transform of the image for the @xmath57 spatial frequency pair of the observation ( see eq .  [ 19 ] in @xcite ) , and this calculation is done successively and summed over five wavelength bins according to the transmission curve of the @xmath0 filter @xcite .",
    "this procedure assumes that spectral energy distributions in the @xmath0 band of our targets are similar to the stellar transmission curve ( rayleigh - jeans tail ) , and this is probably acceptable in the @xmath0 band where the disk emission is just beginning to become an important component of the total flux @xcite .",
    "the fourier transforms along the major and minor axes of the projected disk image for the @xmath1  cas example are illustrated in the right hand panel of figure  1 ( here without accounting for bandwidth smearing ) .",
    "the top curve shows the slower decline in @xmath13 for the smaller minor axis while the bottom curve illustrates the rapid decline for the better resolved major axis .",
    "note that the star itself is so small ( @xmath58 mas ) that its visibility curve in the absence of a disk would decline to only @xmath59 at a baseline of 300  m.    figure 2 shows how the image and visibilities change by altering the disk inclination angle from @xmath60 to @xmath61 ( the dotted lines in the right hand panel copy the original visibility curves from fig .  1 ) .",
    "the rays through the outer positions along the major axis now traverse more optical depth because of the oblique view through the disk , and this brightens the outer regions making the disk effectively larger in this dimension ( so that the decline in @xmath13 with baseline is steeper ) . on the other hand , the minor axis now appears more foreshortened and the visibility decline is reduced .",
    "thus , the @xmath13 variation with position angle in the sky ( with respect to the major axis ) is very sensitive to the disk inclination angle @xmath45 .",
    "the changes resulting from a decrease in disk base density @xmath36 are illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "now the density is lower throughout the disk , and consequently the optically thick part of the disk appears smaller in both dimensions ( and the @xmath13 curves decline more slowly with baseline ) .",
    "changes in the opposite sense result from a decrease in the density exponent as shown in figure  4 ( from @xmath62 to 2.0 ) .",
    "the radial density decline is less steep in this case so that much more of the inner disk is optically thick , leading to a larger appearance in the sky ( steeper decline in the @xmath13 curves ) .",
    "these examples show that the visibility curves are most sensitive to the disk size as given by the boundary between the optically thick and thin regions .",
    "since the optical depth unity radius in the disk plane depends on @xmath63 , there will be a locus of parameters that will produce visibility curves with similar decline rates in the main lobe and with subtle differences appearing only at intermediate and longer baselines .",
    "thus , accurate determinations of both @xmath36 and @xmath37 will require visibility measurements over a broad range of baselines .",
    "we found best fit solutions for the four disk parameters by fitting the model and observed @xmath0 visibilities using a numerical grid search technique .",
    "we used an iterative search on each of the individual parameters to find the set that provided the lowest overall @xmath64 statistic .",
    "the results are listed in table  6 for both single star and binary star models ( see below ) .",
    "the seventh row of table  6 reports the minimum @xmath64 values , and these are all much larger than the expected value of unity for acceptable fits .",
    "recall that the internal errors on @xmath13 may underestimate the actual errors by a factor of 2.8 for these measurements (  2.2 ) , so we might instead expect to find best fits with @xmath65 .",
    "this is more or less consistent with the fitting results for all but @xmath1  cas , where the residuals are still larger than expected .",
    "we estimated the errors in the fitting parameters by renormalizing the minimum @xmath64 to unity and then finding the excursion in the parameter that increased @xmath64 to a value of @xmath66 ( for @xmath67 visibility measurements and 4 fitting parameters ) .",
    "since the disk parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are so closely coupled in the fits (  3.2 ) , we searched the locus of the pair - wise fits for the same increase in @xmath64 , and we quote the half - range in these parameters for their errors .",
    "the first two rows of table  6 give the orientation parameters , the disk plane normal inclination @xmath45 and position angle @xmath5 ( east from north ) .",
    "note that there is a @xmath68 ambiguity in the value of @xmath5 ( i.e. , whether the disk north pole is in the eastern or western half of the sky ) , so we assume the range @xmath69 .",
    "the third and fifth rows list the logarithm ( base 10 ) of the disk base density @xmath70 and the disk density exponent @xmath37 , respectively ( base electron density is @xmath71 ) .",
    "these are compared with the same parameters in rows four and six , respectively , estimated from model fits of the ir flux excess from _ iras _ observations that were computed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite make a number of simplifying assumptions about the disk geometry that make a direct comparison of results unreliable , but in general there is reasonable agreement except in the two cases where a binary companion may influence the results , @xmath2  per and @xmath4  dra ( see below ) .",
    "row 8 gives a derived model quantity related to the ir flux excess , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the integrated disk and stellar flux , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the disk flux is relatively small in the optical , then this quantity can be directly compared to the observed ir flux excess measurements by @xcite that are listed in row 9 . the model and observed values of @xmath75 are comparable but not always a good match .",
    "we suspect the differences may relate to the temporal variations in the disk emission ( from @xmath76 for the ir magnitudes to @xmath77 for the chara array measurements ) .",
    "rows 10 and 11 compare the adopted stellar angular diameter @xmath14 with the model disk emission fwhm diameter along the projected major axis .",
    "the disk emission fwhm was estimated from the width at @xmath78 of the emission intensity in the optically thick part just above the photosphere .",
    "we know that all four targets are close binaries with faint , low - mass companions , but the nature of the companion is only known in the case of @xmath2  per @xcite .",
    "the secondary of @xmath2  per is a hot helium star , the stripped down remains of what was once the more massive star before mass transfer began .",
    "if we assume that all our be star targets are likewise the mass gainers that have been spun up by the angular momentum carried with mass transfer , then they may also have helium star companions ( or possibly white dwarf or neutron star companions ) .",
    "we present here a sample calculation of how such a binary companion would affect the @xmath0 visibilities . for the purpose of this demonstration",
    ", we assume that the companion is a hot ( @xmath79  k ) and small ( @xmath80 ) helium star ( except in the case of @xmath2  per where we have better estimates for these parameters ; see table  1 ) .",
    "according to the interacting binary scenario , the angular momentum vector of the mass gainer be star should be parallel with the orbital angular momentum vector , so the disk plane corresponds to the orbital plane .",
    "consequently , we can apply the orientation parameters for the disk , @xmath45 and @xmath5 , also to the orbit of the secondary .",
    "we know the epoch of the secondary s ascending node passage from the spectroscopic radial velocity curves ( table  1 ) , so the only remaining unknown for the secondary s astrometric orbit is the sense of motion on the sky ( increasing or decreasing position angle with time ) .",
    "we follow the normal convention of assigning an inclination in the range @xmath81 for counterclockwise apparent motion and in the range @xmath82 for clockwise motion ( so that the longitude of the node is @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 ) .",
    "we made fits of the visibility for these two binary orbit cases , and we show in table  6 the results for the best fit sense of motion .",
    "the minimum @xmath64 was significantly reduced only for the case of @xmath2  per ( where the properties of the secondary are known ; the estimated magnitude difference is @xmath87 mag ) .",
    "the inclusion of the binary companion also resulted in a significant change in the fitted disk properties for @xmath4  dra ( discussed further in  5.4 ) .",
    "it is valuable to compare the @xmath0 angular diameters with those derived from narrow - band h@xmath5 interferometry , and to do so we need to fit the visibilities with a simple gaussian ellipsoidal model as done for the h@xmath5 results .",
    "we made these fits also by a numerical grid search of the four parameters that describe the gaussian ellipsoidal model : the angular fwhm of the major axis @xmath88 , the ratio of the minor to major axes @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , the position angle of the major axis @xmath2 ( @xmath91 ) , and the fraction of the total flux contributed by the photosphere of the be star @xmath92 .",
    "the best fit results are listed in table  7 for these single star models .",
    "our results are compared with those from @xcite and @xcite based on interferometric observations of the h@xmath5 emission , and the orientation parameters appear to be in reasonable agreement .",
    "we find , however , that the @xmath0 disk diameters are somewhat smaller than the h@xmath5 diameters ( @xmath93 as large ) , contrary to the wind model predictions of @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath94 residuals of the gaussian elliptical fits are comparable to those from the physical model fits ( table  6 ) , and additional longer baseline observations will be required to distinguish between them .",
    "we can also use the simple disk model to estimate the line profiles of the disk emission lines @xcite . however , the problem is now more complex because of the wavelength dependence of the emission , and a number of key assumptions about the atomic populations must be made . despite these difficulties , it is nevertheless interesting to check whether or not the disk density parameters derived from interferometry lead to predicted line profiles that are consistent with the observed ones . here",
    "we discuss the line synthesis predictions for the disk models and their comparison with our spectroscopic observations .",
    "the line synthesis procedure has many similarities with the disk image calculations present above .",
    "we assume the same basic density law ( eq .  [ 2 ] ) , the same creation of a rectilinear grid of points covering the projected positions of the star and disk in the sky , and the solution of the equation of transfer ( eq .  [ 4 ] ) along along a ray through the center of each grid point .",
    "however , for the line synthesis the expression for the optical depth ( eq .  [ 5 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath95 and now we consider a wavelength dependent optical depth @xmath96 for the region surrounding an emission line ( we adopt an equivalent radial velocity grid in 10 km  s@xmath23 increments from @xmath97 to @xmath98 km  s@xmath23 ) .",
    "the first term in the expression is the scattering coefficient for a classical oscillator that is multiplied by the oscillator strength @xmath99 and the rest wavelength @xmath100 for the specific transition ( h@xmath1 , h@xmath5 , and br@xmath1 ) .",
    "the next term @xmath101 is the local number density of neutral h atoms in energy level @xmath45 .",
    "this can be set approximately by balancing the recombination rate with the photoionization rate ( for the case when all the bound - bound transitions are very optically thick ; @xcite ) @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the recombination coefficient , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the electron and proton number densities , @xmath106 is the number density of hydrogen in energy level @xmath45 , @xmath107 is the photoionization cross section , and @xmath108 is the mean radiation field . if we assume that the latter results only from unattenuated starlight , then the mean field at a distance @xmath89 from the star can be written @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the dilution factor given by @xmath111^{1\\over2}),\\ ] ] @xmath89 is the radial distance from the star @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is the stellar specific intensity . @xcite",
    "rewrite the photoionization / recombination equilibrium to express the level population @xmath106 in terms of a variable @xmath114 , @xmath115 in the stellar photosphere , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( the planck function ) , and the gas will be in lte , so that @xmath118 will be given by the boltzmann - saha equation . in the circumstellar disk , the photoionization rate will vary with @xmath110 and the recombination rate will depend on @xmath119 , so level populations will be given by @xmath120 the actual populations probably have a more complex dependence on position in the disk @xcite .",
    "the final term in optical depth equation is the normalized line profile @xmath121 that depends on the local radial velocity @xmath122 , electron density , and the adopted temperature of the isothermal disk @xmath50 .",
    "we adopted the convolved thermal and stark broadened profiles calculated by t.  schning and k.  butler for h@xmath5 and h@xmath1 , but we used only a simple thermal profile for br@xmath1 .",
    "these profiles were collected into a matrix of 401 wavelength points ( corresponding to our radial velocity grid ) , 60 positive doppler shifts ( in increments of 10 km  s@xmath23 ) , and four electron number densities ( @xmath123 $ ] ) .",
    "the line synthesis calculation proceeds by solving for the intensity spectrum from each pixel in the projected image and then summing these to create a predicted flux profile . at each position along a ray through a pixel , we determine the keplerian velocity and doppler shift , gas density , h population , and profile shape ( simply adopting the closest match in the grid ) , and then we integrate the optical depth for each wavelength point . the summed spectral intensity is then found through equation ( 4 ) , but in this calculation @xmath124 is replaced with a specific intensity corresponding to a photospheric absorption line with the corresponding value of surface normal orientation and doppler shift for the projected position .",
    "these intensity profiles were calculated by first creating line blanketed lte model atmospheres using the atlas9 program written by robert kurucz .",
    "these models assume a stellar temperature and gravity derived from the parameters in table  1 , solar abundances , and a microturbulent velocity of 2 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "then a series of specific intensity spectra were calculated using the code synspec @xcite for each of these models and h lines .",
    "these profiles include the effects of limb darkening for the stellar photosphere .",
    "because our model assumes axial symmetry , we complete the calculation for only the half of the projected image with positive radial velocity and then we add a mirror - symmetric version of the flux profile to account for the other half with negative radial velocity .",
    "the resulting profiles are then rectified to unit continuum flux and smoothed by convolution with a gaussian function to match the instrumental broadening of our spectroscopic observations ( table  5 ) .",
    "we also need to account for the disk ir continuum excess in the case of br@xmath1 , so we renormalize the continuum flux @xmath125 to @xmath126 where @xmath127 ( @xmath75 given in table  6 ) .",
    "the model emission profiles depend on three parameters , the disk base density @xmath36 , the density exponent @xmath37 , and the disk inclination @xmath45 . since our main interest is in checking the consistency of the interferometric and spectroscopic results , we set the values of @xmath37 and @xmath45 from the fits of the chara array visibilities and then varied @xmath36 to find the best match with the observed line profiles .",
    "our results are gathered in table  8 for each of the four targets .",
    "the first three rows give the measured equivalent widths ( where a negative sign indicates a net line flux above the continuum ) for h@xmath5 , h@xmath1 , and br@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the next three rows give the corresponding disk base density @xmath36 that yields synthetic profiles with the observed equivalent width ( or that best match the profile structure in the case of h@xmath1 where the equivalent width is complicated by the presence of line blends ) .",
    "the final row lists for comparison the value of @xmath36 as derived from the interferometric data ( single star results for @xmath1  cas and @xmath3  tau ; binary star results for @xmath2  per and @xmath4  dra ) .",
    "we see that there is relatively good agreement between the densities derived from the three different h lines , and specifically the near agreement of the result from br@xmath1 with those from the balmer lines supports the flux renormalization near br@xmath1 ( eq .  [ 12 ] ) set by the interferometric determination of the ir excess .",
    "the emission line and interferometric densities vary in tandem among the analyses of the four stars , but we find that the emission line densities are systematically lower by approximately 1.7  dex . we suspect that the problem lies in the simplying assumptions made in the model concerning the isothermal disk temperature and h populations that both probably lead to overestimates of the line emission from the outer parts of the disk .",
    "the synthetic model profiles are directly compared with the observed ones in the next section , and we find that all the strong emission lines ( formed in optically thick regions ) appear to be much broader than predicted .",
    "we show one example of this difference in figure  5 for the h@xmath5 line in @xmath1  cas . the basic synthetic model that matches the observed equivalent width shows the strong double peaks associated with keplerian motion in the disk .",
    "the observed profile , on the other hand , lacks well defined peaks and shows much broader line wings .",
    "we also show in figure  5 a smoothed version of the synthetic profile formed by convolution with a voigt function fit using a damping parameter @xmath128 km  s@xmath23 , and this broadened version matches the observed profile quite well .",
    "thus , it appears that the line broadening due to keplerian motion in the disk is insufficient to explain the shapes of the strong lines ( although the weaker h@xmath1 profiles are in better agreement ; see  5 ) .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for the discrepancy : + ( 1 ) we have assumed that the h@xmath5 source function is constant with radius in the disk , but more detailed models by @xcite show that the temperature and presumably the source function decrease with radius .",
    "this suggests that the h@xmath5 emission is probably stronger in the inner disk than portrayed in our model , and since large orbital motions in the inner disk produce the line wings , the model almost certainly underestimates the wing emission .",
    "+ ( 2 ) macroscopic motions such as stellar wind outflow @xcite and turbulence may be important ( especially close to the star where the emission is particularly strong ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) non - coherent scattering of photons into the wings of strong emission lines may extend their widths by as much as a few hundred km  s@xmath23 @xcite , but this may be insufficient to explain the extreme broadening observed in h@xmath5 .",
    "+ ( 4 ) thomson scattering by free electrons in the inner disk may create extended line wings @xcite .",
    "+ ( 5 ) collisional stark broadening will produce similar extended wings , but tests with our model suggest that the base density would need to be increased by about two orders of magnitude for the stark wings to become prominent .",
    "this might be possible if disk gas consists of dense clumps .",
    "+ ( 6 ) raman scattering of photons from the vicinity of the ultraviolet ly@xmath29 line could lead to broad wings in h@xmath5 @xcite if there is a sufficient column density of neutral hydrogen in the disk ( @xmath129 @xmath130 )",
    ". this process might be especially applicable to edge - on and/or cooler disks .",
    "the star @xmath1  cas is perhaps the best documented be star in the sky , and it has displayed be , be - shell , and normal b - type spectra over the course of the last century @xcite .",
    "it currently displays strong h@xmath5 emission , and the h@xmath5 disk size was recently determined through observations from npoi @xcite . our best fit disk ( table  6 ) and",
    "gaussian elliptical models ( table  7 ) are generally consistent with the h@xmath5 interferometric results and indicate that we view this be star disk at an intermediate inclination .",
    "the disk density exponent we derive , @xmath131 , matches within errors the value @xmath132 found by @xcite based on an analysis of the 2.4  45 @xmath133 m spectrum from iso - sws .",
    "we show the model @xmath0 image of @xmath1  cas in the left hand panel of figure  6 and the corresponding visibility image ( without the effects of bandwidth smearing ) is shown in the right hand panel .",
    "both images are scaled logarithmic representations made to accentuate the low level features .",
    "the @xmath57 frequencies of the chara array observations are shown in the upper half of the visibility image with symbol sizes proportional to the observed visibility .",
    "they also appear in point - symmetric locations in the lower half where they represent the residual - to - error ratio ( vertical segment for @xmath134 and horizontal for @xmath135 ) .",
    "the residuals from the fit are large for our observations of @xmath1  cas , but they do not appear to indicate any systematic deviation from the model since we find some of the largest positive and negative deviations in the same part of the @xmath57 diagram .",
    "we suspect that the high value of @xmath64 reflects an incomplete accounting of the full error budget .",
    "@xcite discovered that @xmath1  cas is a single - lined spectroscopic binary , and their orbit was confirmed in subsequent doppler shift measurements by @xcite .",
    "we made a fit of the visibilities by including a possible hot subdwarf companion that was placed in the model images using the spectroscopic ephemeris from @xcite ( table  1 ) .",
    "this modification made a slight improvement in the residuals of the fit , and models with a secondary hotter than @xmath136  kk showed somewhat better agreement .",
    "the profiles of the h@xmath5 , h@xmath1 , and br@xmath1 emission lines are plotted as thick lines in figure  7 .",
    "we also plot the synthetic model profiles as thin lines for each feature .",
    "the model profiles of the weaker h@xmath1 and br@xmath1 features make a reasonable match of the observed profiles , but , as noted above , the h@xmath5 profile is much broader and smoother than predicted .",
    "@xcite suggest that there may be significant turbulence in the inner disk of @xmath1  cas that is associated with magnetic dynamo processes , and such turbulent motions could help to explain the wings observed in h@xmath5 .",
    "the binary system @xmath2  per is the only one of the four targets where we known the nature of the secondary and can reliably predict its flux contribution in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "the companion is a hot subdwarf whose spectrum appears clearly in uv spectroscopy from _ hst _ , and from the relative strengths of its spectral lines , we can estimate with confidence its temperature , radius , and hence its near - ir flux contribution . indeed",
    "the fit of the chara array visibilities is better for the binary model than the single star model ( table  6 ) . here",
    "the inclusion of the binary flux leads to a downwards revision of the disk size .",
    "we show in left hand panel of figure  8 the image of the entire binary for the observation made on hjd 2,453,656.9 ( orbital phase 0.644 ) , which is similar to the binary orientation for most of the observations ( table  4 ) .",
    "the right hand panel shows the visibility image that is now modulated with the interference pattern introduced by the binary companion .",
    "since the presence of the secondary does affect the visibility pattern , additional interferometric data should lead to an astrometric orbit that will allow us to test whether or not the disk and orbit are co - planar @xcite .",
    "the position angle of the disk that we find is about @xmath137 different than that from the recent narrow - band h@xmath5 measurements from @xcite ( table  7 ) .",
    "our solution is somewhat influenced by our assumptions about the properties of the secondary s orbit , and additional observations at other binary phases will be required to settle the issue of the disk and orbit orientations .",
    "we also find a much lower density exponent @xmath138 than the value of @xmath139 found by @xcite based on fitting the ir - excess from _ iras _ data , but their result is sensitive to the adopted disk radius .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrated that a density exponent of @xmath140 also fit the ir - excess provided the disk radius was limited to @xmath141 , so the difference in our results probably hinges on differences in the model assumptions .",
    "figure  9 shows the h@xmath5 , h@xmath1 , and br@xmath1 profiles for @xmath2  per .",
    "the peaks in the h@xmath1 profile reversed in strength between our observations in 2004 and 2005 .",
    "this is an important reminder that the disk is time variable and is also probably somewhat asymmetrical in appearance @xcite , properties that are beyond the scope of our simple disk models .",
    "both the h@xmath5 and br@xmath1 line are observed to be broader than predicted by the disk model .",
    "@xcite derived the best radial velocity curve to date for this single - lined binary , and we adopt his period here but we took the epoch from the the more recent spectroscopic study by @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the single star and binary fits to the interferometry shows essentially no differences in the resulting @xmath64 values , so we will discuss the single star results here .",
    "the spatial and visibility images resulting from the fit are shown in figure  10 .",
    "our results indicate that we are viewing this system close to edge - on , and the decline in visibility is especially marked along the direction of the projected major axis of the disk .",
    "our derived orientation in the sky is in reasonable agreement with the h@xmath5 results from @xcite , and the density law agrees within errors with that obtained from fitting the ir - excess flux @xcite .",
    "the spectral line profiles of @xmath3  tau are illustrated in figure  11 .",
    "again we find that the observed h@xmath5 line is much broader than the model profile , and here we see evidence of a significant asymmetry in the disk in the differing heights of the blue and red emission peaks .",
    "the long term variations in these asymmetries are documented by @xcite .",
    "@xcite made h@xmath5 interferometric observations in narrow bands matching the blue and red peaks , and their results support the idea that the disk density is modulated by a prograde one - armed oscillation .",
    "the h@xmath1 line shows a deep central `` shell '' feature that is consistent with the formation of such shell lines in be stars observed near @xmath142 @xcite . the fact that our model h@xmath1 line depth is shallower than the observed depth probably indicates that the outer parts of the disk are cooler than assumed in our isothermal model .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that @xmath4  dra is a low amplitude , single - lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 65.6  d. @xcite describe a long - term cyclic variation of about 22  y that is present in the emission lines , and they suggest that this period may correspond to the disk s modulation due to an interaction with a third star in an eccentric orbit .",
    "the semimajor axis of the third star would be on the order of 100  mas for the adopted distance , but we find no obvious evidence ( separated fringe packets ) for such a companion even at the shortest baselines .",
    "thus , we have confined our test fits here to the single star and binary star ( @xmath143  d ) cases .",
    "the fit for the single star case is odd in several respects .",
    "the density exponent is unusually small and the inclination of @xmath142 is at odds with estimates from spectroscopy ( @xmath144 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the binary fit has similar residuals , but it brings the density exponent and inclination into better accord with expectations .",
    "thus , we will adopt the binary model that is based on a hot , subdwarf companion , but we caution that additional interferometric observations are required to make reliable estimates for the companion s orbit and flux contribution .    the model spatial and visibility images are shown in figure  12 , and",
    "we see in this case that the binary modulation is equal to or greater than the disk variation in importance .",
    "the chara array measurements presented here are the first interferometric observations of this target , so there are no h@xmath5 results for comparison .",
    "@xcite found that the intrinsic continuum polarization angle is generally perpendicular to the projected disk major axis in the sky .",
    "@xcite estimated the intrinsic polarization angle for @xmath4  dra as @xmath145 east from north ( in agreement with the estimate of @xmath146 from a recent polarization analysis by k.bjorkman , private communication ) , and this agrees within errors with the position angle of @xmath147 from the fit of the interferometric visibilities .",
    "the line profiles are shown in figure  13 .",
    "we find that the h@xmath5 emission strength is approximately that expected for the epoch of our observations and the long term variation ( see fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "once again the h@xmath5 profile ( and perhaps the h@xmath1 profile ) appear to be broader than predicted by the keplerian model .",
    "the chara array observations represent the first @xmath0 interferometric measurements of northern be stars , and we find that the disks of all four targets are at least partially resolved .",
    "the derived disk inclination angle and position angle in the sky generally agree with similar estimates from narrow - band h@xmath5 interferometry where available .",
    "we find , for example , that the disk of @xmath3  tau appears with a nearly edge - on orientation , which is consistent with the prediction for be stars with shell spectral features @xcite .",
    "all four of the targets are close binaries with faint companions , and these companions appear to influence the @xmath0 visibilities of @xmath2  per and @xmath4  dra , an interesting but complicating factor for the interpretation of the disk properties .",
    "we find , for example , that the radial gradient in disk density ( density exponent @xmath37 in table  6 ) is smaller in binaries with smaller semimajor axes , which suggests that binary companions do influence the disk properties .",
    "we developed a simple keplerian disk model to create synthetic angular images of the disks , and we used these models to create model interferometric visibility patterns and spectral emission line profiles for comparison with our observations .",
    "these models assume isothermal disks and ignore scattering in the radiative transfer process , two significant limitations that should be addressed in a more complete model .",
    "the disks are characterized by two physical parameters , the base density and density exponent , and two observational parameters , the disk normal inclination and position angle .",
    "we fit the chara array visibilities for all four parameters for both single and binary star models , and our results are in good agreement with prior studies of the ir - excess in these stars .",
    "the parameters derived from the interferometry lead to model emission lines that match the observed ones if the base densities are reduced by a factor of about 1.7  dex .",
    "this mismatch is not unexpected considering the many simplifying assumptions made in the model .",
    "we find that the angular diameters of the be disks in the @xmath0-band are consistently smaller than those found from h@xmath5 interferometry .",
    "we think that this difference results from the larger h@xmath5 opacity and the hydrogen ionization structure in the disk .",
    "the @xmath0 disk emission comes primarily from free - free processes in the mainly ionized gas , and the free - free optical depth will vary with disk radius according to the square of the density . in the thin disk approximation , the optical depth at radial distance @xmath34 will vary as @xmath148 ( see eq .  [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the h@xmath5 emission depends on the relatively low neutral hydrogen number density , and we assumed above that this varies inversely with the stellar dilution factor ( eq .  [ 9 ] ; @xmath149 at large radius and @xmath150 ) .",
    "thus , we expect the h@xmath5 optical depth to vary approximately as @xmath151 , i.e. , with a shallower effective density exponent of @xmath152 .",
    "consequently , the h@xmath5 optical depth reduction with increasing disk radius will be less pronounced than in the case of the ir optical depth , resulting in a larger spatial extension in the h@xmath5 emission compared to that for the @xmath0 emission .",
    "this expectation is borne out in the predicted spatial images .",
    "we show an example of the derived spatial structure in figure  14 for our single star model of @xmath1  cas .",
    "the solid line shows the summed @xmath0-band intensity of the image projected onto the major axis of the disk and measured in stellar radii from the center of the star .",
    "we used our model to create an h@xmath5 image adopting the base density from the fit of the observed emission line ( table  8) .",
    "the intensity was formed by summing across a 2.8  nm wavelength band centered on h@xmath5 in order to match the h@xmath5 interferometric observations of @xcite .",
    "note that changing the adopted bandwidth will simply result in a rescaling of the contrast between the central star and the surrounding disk emission .",
    "the disk image appears darker along the line of nodes and along the line of sight because of the minimal shear broadening that occurs at those disk azimuthal angles and the subsequent reduction in the range of wavelength over which h@xmath5 is optically thick .",
    "the dashed line in figure  14 shows the summed h@xmath5 image intensity projected onto the major axis .",
    "we see that h@xmath5 emission is indeed more extended along the major axis and that the half maximum intensity radii are located at @xmath153 and @xmath154 for the @xmath0 band and h@xmath5 summed intensities , respectively .",
    "the ratio of these half maximum intensity radii is 0.35 , which is comparable to the observed ratio of 0.55 of the fwhm of the major axes of the @xmath0-band and h@xmath5 emission in the gaussian elliptical fits ( table  7 ) .",
    "thus , the differences in the radial exponent dependence of density squared and the neutral hydrogen fraction may partially explain the larger appearance of the h@xmath5 disks .",
    "the chara array observations demonstrate the promise of these kinds of measurements for our understanding of be stars .",
    "many be stars were probably spun up by mass transfer in a past close interaction , and future observations over a range in @xmath57 and orbital phase coverage will reveal the nature of their companions .",
    "the disks of be stars are driven by dynamic processes and evolve over timescales of months to years , so long - term observations will help elucidate the physics of disk formation and dispersal .",
    "there is ample evidence that the disks are structured and prone to the formation of spiral arm features @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in be binaries like @xmath2  per , the portion of the disk closest to the hot companion may appear brighter due to local heating by the companion s radiation @xcite .",
    "the techniques of phase closure using multiple telescopes in long baseline interferometry @xcite will soon give us the means to study these disk processes directly among the nearby be stars .",

    "<S> the measurements were made with multiple telescope pairs of the chara array interferometer , and in every case the observations indicate that the circumstellar disks of the targets are resolved . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the interferometric visibilities with predictions from a simple disk model that assumes an isothermal gas in keplerian rotation . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting densities are in broad agreement with prior studies of the ir excess flux and the resulting orientations generally agree with those from interferometric h@xmath5 and continuum polarimetric observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the angular size of the @xmath0 disk emission is smaller than that determined for the h@xmath5 emission , and we argue that the difference is the result of a larger h@xmath5 opacity and the relatively larger neutral hydrogen fraction with increasing disk radius . </S>",
    "<S> all the targets are known binaries with faint companions , and we find that companions appear to influence the interferometric visibilities in the cases of @xmath2  per and @xmath4  dra . </S>",
    "<S> we also present contemporaneous observations of the h@xmath5 , h@xmath1 , and br@xmath1 emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> synthetic model profiles of these lines that are based on the same disk inclination and radial density exponent as derived from the chara array observations match the observed emission line strength if the disk base density is reduced by @xmath6 dex . </S>"
