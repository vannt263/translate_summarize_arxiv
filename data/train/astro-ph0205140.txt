    "the influential paper of navarro , frenk & white @xcite proposed a universal , broken power - law profile for dark matter halos in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on distance from the halo center was found to be well described by a two - parameter family of distributions , @xmath4 the central density of the nfw profile diverges as @xmath5 , similar to what was found in earlier @xmath6-body studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however the small - radius dependence was little more than an ansatz since the relevant scales were barely resolved in the simulations .",
    "a debate ensued as to whether the profiles are indeed universal , and if so , what power of radius describes the dark matter density in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "a number of subsequent studies @xcite found steeper central profiles , e.g. @xmath8 , the `` moore '' profile .    at about the same time , the luminous ( stellar ) densities in galaxies were found to be centrally divergent @xcite ; in contrast with cdm halos , the power law index of stellar nuclei varies widely but correlates well with galaxy properties , in the sense that fainter galaxies have steeper cusps @xcite .",
    "while the power - law nature of stellar cusps suggests a gravitational origin , gas dynamics probably also played a role in their formation , including processes like radiative dissipation , star formation , and energy infusion from supernova explosions .",
    "the power - law nature of density stratification in virialized objects arises naturally in the standard cosmological paradigm where the growth of objects proceeds from smallest to largest scales @xcite starting from a featureless spectrum of primordial fluctuations @xmath9 .",
    "building blocks of structure can be identified with peaks in the field of primordial gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the ensemble - averaged `` profile '' of an individual density peak is then a power law with slope related to the tilt @xmath10 of the primordial spectrum on a given scale @xcite .",
    "furthermore , evolution of virialized systems through mergers tends to preserve the power - law slope of the central cusp @xcite .",
    "outside of the central cusp , the profile will be modified by the tidal field of neighboring peaks and by the redistribution of material in unequal - mass mergers .",
    "it was noticed rather quickly following the advent of realistic large - scale cosmological @xmath6-body simulations that after the slope and normalization of the density profiles are taken into account , cusps predicted by the simulations are too concentrated to accommodate dynamical constraints derived from the rotation curves of ( especially low surface brightness ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "better fits were obtained with ad hoc , constant - central - density profiles , e.g. the non - singular `` isothermal sphere '' @xcite .",
    "core sizes are not well constrained but recent model fits to the rotation curve data give @xmath11 kpc for most galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . other observations on galaxy scales ( such as strong lensing @xcite )",
    "have led to more equivocal assessments of the compatibility of dark matter models with observations . meanwhile",
    ", the most detailed study to date of resolution effects in the cdm simulations @xcite argues that the innermost resolved cusp slope is marginally steeper than nfw , @xmath12 , and that it exhibits a shallowing trend with decreasing radius .",
    "the cusp problem in cdm cosmologies can be alleviated either by postulating changes in the basic physics , or by adding baryons that couple to the dark matter and modify its profile .",
    "proposed changes in fundamental physics include weakly - interacting particles with large scattering cross - sections @xcite , `` warm '' dark matter @xcite , broken scale - invariance @xcite , or modified gravity @xcite .",
    "standard - physics solutions include outflow of gas during an early phase of galaxy formation @xcite , torques from a barlike perturbation @xcite or infall of a population of condensed objects which disrupt the cusp @xcite .",
    "current notions of galaxy formation are not precise enough to allow testing of most of these ideas . here",
    "we focus on the last mechanism , displacement of dark matter by condensed objects , because the dynamics are straightforward and the predicted level of the effect is quantifiable .",
    "a lower limit on the displaced mass is set by the known masses of compact objects at the centers of galaxies , the supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) @xcite , some of which are known to have been present since @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "regardless of their detailed formation history , these black holes must have grown partly through the coalescence of less - massive black holes during galaxy mergers , displacing and ejecting dark ( and baryonic ) matter .",
    "predicted core sizes are @xmath14 hundreds of parsecs , consistent with the sizes of _ stellar _ cores in moderate- to high - luminosity galaxies , which probably formed in the same way . while it remains to be seen whether this model can explain all of the discrepancies between predicted and observed densities at the centers of halos , particularly in low - surface - brightness and dwarf galaxies , the model is almost certainly relevant to the dark matter distribution within a few tens of parsecs of the sbhs where dark matter annihilation radiation would be peaked",
    "accumulation of baryons at the center of a dark - matter halo will deepen the gravitational potential and steepen the cusp , but the net effect depends on whether the baryons also deposit energy into the dark matter as they fall in . the simplest model ( fig .",
    "1a ) is adiabatic growth of a central point mass due to radial infall of gas @xcite .",
    "let the initial mass of the central lump be zero and its final mass @xmath1 . for simplicity ,",
    "assume that the orbits of the dark matter particles are circles ; if growth of the central lump is slow , the orbits will remain circular due to adiabatic invariance .",
    "conservation of angular momentum implies @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the initial and final radii of a dark - matter particle , @xmath18 is the dark mass within @xmath16 and @xmath1 is assumed to dominate the potential within @xmath17 .",
    "conservation of dark matter further implies @xmath19 .    if the initial dark matter density profile is a power law , @xmath20 , the two conservation laws imply @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "a more realistic , isotropic orbital distribution predicts the same relation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite . for @xmath25 , the index of the power - law",
    "`` spike ''",
    "so formed lies between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; the spike extends roughly to the outer radius of influence of the central object , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the velocity dispersion of the dark - matter particles in the pre - existing halo . in physical units , @xmath30 where the central mass has been normalized to @xmath31 and the velocity dispersion to @xmath32 km s@xmath33",
    "this model has been widely used to predict the flux of annihilation radiation from dark matter particles around the milky way black hole ; most of the radiation would come from the spike @xcite .",
    "the outcome is very different if the lumps form off - center , or are deposited in the halo following a merger ( fig .",
    "1b ) . the lumps spiral inward due to dynamical friction , transferring their energy into the background and _ lowering _ the central density @xcite .",
    "one well - studied case is the formation of a binary sbh following a merger . the binary first forms at a separation of @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the binary mass .",
    "continued evolution of the binary occurs through the * gravitational slingshot * @xcite : dark matter particles that approach the binary within a distance @xmath36 are kicked out at velocities of @xmath37 .",
    "slingshot ejection occurs at a rate determined by the coupled equations @xmath38 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath39 is the mass ejected by the binary and @xmath3 and @xmath29 refer to the background .",
    "the dimensionless numbers @xmath40 and @xmath41 are functions of @xmath42 and the binary separartion ; in the limit of a `` hard '' binary , @xmath43 , and for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "solving the coupled equations for @xmath47 is not straightforward however since @xmath3 changes with time as the dark matter is ejected .",
    "simple models that take into account this time dependence @xcite give @xmath48 , consistent with what is seen in detailed @xmath6-body simulations @xcite .    fig .",
    "2 shows the results of one such simulation @xcite .",
    "the merger was between equal - mass spheroids with steep central cusps , @xmath49 , and point particles representing the two sbhs .",
    "the @xmath50 cusp is gradually converted into an @xmath51 cusp by the gravitational slingshot ; at the end of the simulation , the ejected mass is roughly twice the mass of the binary sbh .    ; solid lines show the evolution of @xmath3 starting roughly at the time when a hard binary is formed .",
    "( b ) surface density profiles . ]",
    "the total mass ejected by a point - mass binary depends on how long the binary continues to shrink .",
    "an upper limit in the case of binary sbhs is given by the mass ejected in decaying to a separation of @xmath52 , the distance at which emission of gravitational radiation induces a rapid coalescence .",
    "the ejected mass is @xmath53 with @xmath54 the mass of the smaller black hole and @xmath55 @xcite . for binary sbhs ,",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 pc and the total mass ejected in decaying to @xmath52 is @xmath58 . however",
    "a binary may `` stall '' after ejecting less mass if the density in its vicinity drops too low @xcite .",
    "if the number of massive infalling objects exceeds two , heating of the background by binaries can occur indirectly as well : massive particles are given kicks , then lose their kinetic energy to the background as they spiral in and are kicked out again etc . as a crude model of this process , consider the evolution of an ensemble of point particles of mass @xmath59 orbiting in a dark - matter halo with @xmath49  slightly steeper than the cusps found in cdm simulations but easier to treat .",
    "the energy released as one lump spirals in from radius @xmath16 to @xmath17 is @xmath60 .",
    "decay will halt when the lumps form a self - gravitating system of radius @xmath61 with @xmath1 the total baryonic mass .",
    "equating the energy released during infall with the energy of dark matter initially within @xmath62 , the `` core radius , '' gives @xmath63 most of the particles that deposit their energy within @xmath62 will come from radii @xmath64 , implying @xmath65 and a displaced mass of @xmath66 .",
    "evolution will continue as the massive particles form binaries and begin to kick out other massive particles .",
    "assume that ejection occurs via many small kicks , such that almost all of the binding energy so released can find its way into the dark matter as the ejected particles spiral back into the core .",
    "the energy released by a single binary in shrinking to a separation such that its orbital velocity equals the escape velocity from the core is @xmath67 .",
    "if all of the massive particles find themselves in such binaries before their final ejection and if most of their energy is deposited near the center of the halo , the core mass will be @xmath68 e. g. @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "a detailed @xmath6-body simulation illustrates this process ( fig .",
    "the initial model for the dark - matter halo has @xmath8 at small radii and total mass @xmath71 .",
    "the condensed objects were represented by 20 point masses , each weighing 10 times as much as a dark matter particle and with combined mass @xmath72 .",
    "evolution occurs in two stages , as discussed above .",
    "as the orbits of the massive particles initially decay , they transfer energy to the background and lower the central density .",
    "once the massive particles form a bound subsystem , further evolution is driven by the formation and disruption of binaries .",
    "the result is a slower growth of the dark matter core , as massive particles are ejected from the central regions and fall back in . at the end of the simulation",
    "the dark mass ejected from the cusp is @xmath73 .    only a single massive binary is left at the end ",
    "most of the particles that displaced the dark matter have been ejected from the system .",
    "this model is the dynamical analog of wind - driven outflow models @xcite : in both schemes , the baryons that created the core are no longer in evidence after the core is in place .",
    "central density cusps .",
    "axis scalings are based on an assumed black hole mass of @xmath31 , a halo mass of @xmath74 and a virial radius of @xmath75 kpc .",
    "]    is this a realistic model ?",
    "multiple baryonic clumps are often postulated to form via gaseous dissipation in the early stages of galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ) but their masses , numbers and degree of central concentration are poorly known . another possible candidate for the lumps",
    "is an early population of black holes , e.g. the remnants of population iii stars ( @xmath76 ) @xcite .",
    "but current theory suggests that only one such black hole forms per mini - halo at a redshift of @xmath77 @xcite , and furthermore the inspiral time for an object of this mass would be of order @xmath78 yr , unless it came attached to a larger mass .",
    "black holes of intermediate mass ( @xmath79 ) are a third possibility but their existence is debated and their time of formation uncertain .",
    "sbhs have been present in at least some spheroids since a redshift of @xmath80 @xcite ; many of the sbhs that we see now should therefore be the products of multiple mergers .",
    "typically those mergers will have been `` minor , '' @xmath81 .",
    "in such an interaction the ejected mass scales with @xmath54 , the mass of the smaller hole ; the total mass ejected in a sequence of such mergers would then depend only on @xmath1 , the final mass . however if a black hole grows via a merger hierarchy of comparably - massive black holes , the effect on the density cusp should be to a certain extent * cumulative * : a merger of two galaxies whose cusps had previously been destroyed by binary black holes , will produce a shallower central profile than a merger between two galaxies with initially steep cusps .",
    "this is verified via an @xmath6-body experiment in fig .",
    "4 . the ejected mass scales both with @xmath1 , the final black hole mass , and @xmath6 , the number of stages in the merger hierarchy .    there is some quantitative empirical support for idea that cores are produced from the binding energy released by binary black holes .",
    "the luminous ( stellar ) matter in elliptical galaxies and bulges exhibits steep power - law cusps in faint galaxies and cores in bright galaxies @xcite ; among the `` core '' galaxies , the core mass is of order @xmath0 with @xmath1 the current black hole mass @xcite .",
    "the largest cores observed , in galaxies like m87 , have sizes of @xmath82 kpc ; it seems circumstantially reasonable to suppose that dark - matter cores could be comparable in size .",
    "the persistence of steep cusps in faint elliptical galaxies is puzzling but may indicate that the stellar cusps formed by dissipative processes during or after the last significant merger @xcite ; in any case , presence of a stellar cusp is not necessarily evidence for a dark matter cusp .",
    "sbhs represent an extreme in terms of compactness , but galaxies contain other condensed components that could in principle act like `` black holes '' during mergers , displacing dark matter as they spiral inward .",
    "bulges are an obvious candidate ; with masses @xmath83 times those of sbhs @xcite they could in principle displace a much larger quantity of dark matter . in order for two bulges to act like a `` binary black hole ,",
    "'' they must be compact enough to not overlap appreciably at the separation where they first form a bound subsystem .",
    "this separation is @xmath84 with @xmath29 the dark matter velocity dispersion . requiring this separation to be greater than the bulge scale length @xmath85 gives @xmath86 or @xmath87 , with @xmath88 the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "thus a `` hot '' bulge is a `` hard '' bulge .",
    "in fact @xmath88 appears to be comparable to , though somewhat larger than , @xmath29 @xcite so it is unlikely that bulges  at least as we currently observe them  would be effective at displacing dark matter during mergers .",
    "if dark matter consists of massive weakly interacting particles like neutralinos , the particles should self - annihilate producing a potentially observable signal .",
    "the annihilation rate in a spherical halo is @xmath89 with @xmath90 the neutralino mass , @xmath91 the annihilation cross section , and @xmath3 the dark matter density @xcite .",
    "annihilation products include gamma rays , from the decay of neutral pions ; high - energy neutrinos ; and synchrotron emission from high energy positrons and electrons moving in the ambient magnetic field .",
    "since the annihilation flux depends on the squared density of neutralinos , the signal would be greatly enhanced along lines of sight where the dark matter is clumped .",
    "these include the center of the milky way galaxy , where the density in a smooth halo would be maximum , as well as directions that intersect the centers of relic halos orbiting as subclumps in the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "the annihilation signal from the galactic center would be further enhanced if there is a power - law spike associated with the central sbh , as discussed above .",
    "gondolo & silk @xcite considered this case and showed that the flux is increased by @xmath92 orders of magnitude compared with models lacking a central spike .",
    "this prediction has been claimed to be inconsistent with measured fluxes of annihilation products , including synchrotron emission @xcite and neutrinos @xcite ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the central slope of the milky way s dark matter distribution could have been substantially lowered if the halo experienced a merger after formation of the spike , assuming that the infalling halo also contained a sbh .",
    "at least one such merger , with a mass ratio of @xmath93 or less , is statistically likely to have been experienced by a halo as massive as that of the milky way since a redshift of @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "4 shows density profiles of merged dark matter halos , in simulations where the initial profile of the larger halo was normalized to match the milky way , with a central @xmath95 density cusp @xcite .",
    "the spike is efficiently destroyed by the binary sbh in all of the mergers , greatly reduced the predicted annihilation flux .",
    "cusp destruction may have been avoided in the case of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "little is known about the detailed merger history of the milky way but it has been argued that the ages of stars in the galaxy s `` thick disk '' imply a time of @xmath96 gyr since the last significant merger @xcite . the milky way sbh may have acquired most of its mass during or even after this merger event . however ,",
    "if the sbh grew significantly after a merger that had destroyed a pre - existing dark matter spike , it is unlikely that the new spike would be as steep .",
    "the reason is that the dark matter density would probably be non - singular following the merger ( e.g. fig .",
    "4 ) , and growth of a point mass in a non - singular background produces a shallow spike , @xmath8 @xcite",
    ". the annihilation flux from such a spike would be only slightly greater than the expected background in the direction of the galactic center @xcite .      the @xmath6-body simulation illustrated in fig .",
