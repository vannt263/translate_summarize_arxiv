    "quasicontinuum ( qc ) approximations reduce the computational complexity of a material simulation by reducing the degrees of freedom used to describe a configuration of atoms and by giving approximate equilibrium equations on the reduced degrees of freedom  @xcite . for crystalline materials ,",
    "there are typically a few small regions with highly non - uniform structure caused by defects in the material which are surrounded by large regions where the local environment of atoms varies slowly .",
    "the idea of qc is to replace these slowly varying regions with a continuum model and couple it directly to the atomistic model surrounding the defects .",
    "the material s position is described by a set of representative atoms that are in one - to - one correspondence with the lattice atoms in the atomistic regions but reduce the degrees of freedom in the continuum regions .",
    "quasi - static computations in material simulations explore mechanical response under slow external loading by fully relaxing the material at each step of a parameterized path of external conditions .",
    "such simulations can model nano - indentation , stress - induced phase transformations , and many other material processes .",
    "the characteristic feature when using this technique is that the process to be modeled occurs slowly enough that dynamics are assumed to play no role in determining the relaxed state .",
    "this paper focuses on applying continuation techniques  @xcite to the nonlinear equilibrium equations of the force - based quasicontinuum approximation ( qcf ) .",
    "there are many choices available for the interaction among the representative atoms , especially between those in the atomistic and continuum regions , which has led to the development of a variety of quasicontinuum approximations .",
    "criteria for determining a good choice of approximation for a given problem are still being developed .",
    "algorithmic simplicity and efficiency is certainly important for implementation and application , but concerns about accuracy have led to the search for consistent schemes . since the forces on all of the atoms in a uniformly strained lattice are zero , we define a quasicontinuum approximation to be consistent if there are no forces on the representative atoms for a lattice that has been deformed by a uniform strain .",
    "we note that the atomistic to continuum interface is typically where consistency fails for a qc approximation  @xcite as is the case for the original qc method  @xcite .    for static problems",
    ", qcf is an attractive choice for quasicontinuum approximation because it is a consistent scheme  @xcite that is algorithmically simple : the force on each representative atom is given by either an atomistic calculation or a continuum finite element calculation .",
    "the algorithmic simplicity of the force - based quasicontinuum method has allowed it to be implemented with adaptive mesh refinement and atomistic to continuum model selection algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the trade - off for the consistency and algorithmic simplicity of qcf is that it does not give a conservative force field , although it is close to a conservative field  @xcite .",
    "thus , qcf is a method to approximate forces , rather than a method to approximate the energy .",
    "quasicontinuum energies have been proposed that utilize special energies for atoms in an interfacial region  @xcite , and corresponding conditions for consistency have been satisfied for planar interfaces  @xcite .",
    "however , there is currently no known consistent quasicontinuum energy that allows general nonplanar atomistic to continuum interfaces and mesh coarsening in the continuum region ( other than the computationally intensive constrained quasicontinuum energy discussed in section  [ secconstrain ] ) .",
    "we will , however , investigate the use of quasicontinuum energies as preconditioners for the force - based quasicontinuum approximation .",
    "our goal is to efficiently approximate the solution @xmath0 to the qcf equilibrium equations @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 are the coordinates of the representative atoms that describe the material and the parameter @xmath3 $ ] represents the change in external loads such as an indenter position or an applied force . using continuation , we start from @xmath4 which is usually easy to find ( such as a resting position ) and follow the solution branch by incrementing @xmath5 and looking for a solution @xmath0 in a neighborhood of the previous solution .",
    "the continuation approach that we analyze in this paper has been used to obtain computational solutions to materials deformation problems  @xcite and is implemented in the multidimensional qc code  @xcite .",
    "the approach that we will investigate in this paper uses constant extrapolation in @xmath5 to obtain initial states for the iterative solution of @xmath6 at a sequence of load steps @xmath7 where @xmath8 and solves the iterative equations using a preconditioner force @xmath9 that comes from a quasicontinuum energy @xmath10 that is , @xmath11 we will focus our analysis on a specific preconditioner later , but the splitting and subsequent analysis works for any choice of quasicontinuum energy .",
    "the outer iteration at a fixed step @xmath7 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the residual force and @xmath14 is sometimes called a `` ghost force correction '' in the mechanics literature  @xcite .",
    "we will consider preconditioner forces @xmath15 that differ from @xmath6 only in atomistic to continuum interfacial regions so that the ghost force correction is inexpensive to compute .",
    "since the preconditioner forces come from an energy , the outer iteration equations for @xmath16 can be solved by an inner iteration that finds the local minimum in a neighborhood of @xmath17 for @xmath18\\ ] ] using an energy minimization method starting with initial guess @xmath19    we give an analysis to optimize the computational efficiency of the continuation algorithm   by varying the parameter step size , @xmath20 and the number of outer iterations , @xmath21 our analysis first considers the goal of computing an approximation of @xmath0 uniformly for @xmath22 $ ] to a given tolerance , @xmath23 the proposed strategy selects the step size @xmath24 so that the initial iterates @xmath25 are in the domain of convergence of the outer iteration and so that the tolerance is achieved by the continuous , piecewise linear interpolant of the solution at each parameter @xmath26 the required accuracy at the @xmath7 is achieved by the fast convergence of the iteration  . as @xmath27",
    "our analysis gives that @xmath28 and @xmath29 for all @xmath30 so that an efficient way to achieve increased accuracy uses a balance between small step size for accurate interpolation and a large number of iterations per step .",
    "we then consider the goal of efficiently computing the final state @xmath31 to a given tolerance , @xmath23 for this goal , the result of our analysis states that an efficient strategy fixes the number of outer iterations to @xmath32 at all but the final step and takes the largest possible steps , @xmath33 such that the initial guesses , @xmath34 remain in the domain of convergence of the iteration .",
    "this strategy determines the number of steps , @xmath35 independently of @xmath23 the required tolerance , @xmath36 is then achieved at @xmath37 by doing sufficiently many iterations , @xmath38 in this case , only @xmath39 as @xmath40    we give numerical results for the deformation of a lennard - jones chain under tension that demonstrate the importance of selecting the step size , @xmath33 and number of outer iterations , @xmath41 so that the iterates @xmath42 remain in the domain of convergence of the iteration .",
    "the numerical experiment shows that our algorithm diverges ( the chain spuriously undergoes fracture ) if we attempt to solve for the deformation corresponding to a load near the limit load by a step size @xmath43    we give a derivation of the force - based quasicontinuum approximation and the energy - based preconditioner in section  [ sec : qc ] . in section",

    "the equilibrium equations for the total constrained quasicontinuum energy , @xmath90 are then given by @xmath91    the constrained quasicontinuum approximation is attractive since it gives conservative forces and since it is the only known quasicontinuum energy that is consistent when generalized to multidimensional approximations  @xcite .",
    "the constrained quasicontinuum approximation is also attractive since its conjugate forces   are located at only @xmath92 representative atoms ; however , we must still compute the forces at all @xmath93 atoms which makes it computationally infeasible .",
    "some computational savings can be made in the interior of large elements by separating the energy computations into element energy plus surface energy ; however , in higher dimensions the large number of atoms near element boundaries makes the constrained quasicontinuum approximation impractical . finally , it is attractive because its approximation error comes only from the restriction to linear deformations within the element making it possible to analyze using classical finite element error analysis .",
    "we now recast the constrained approximation in terms of continuum mechanics to introduce the _ local quasicontinuum energy _ which is simply a continuous , piecewise linear approximation of a hyperelastic continuum model where the strain - energy density is derived from the atomistic potential , @xmath94 this energy efficiently approximates the conjugate force at the representative atoms .",
    "we have that  @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 are the length and deformation gradient of the @xmath97th element , and @xmath98 is the strain - energy density for an infinite atomistic chain with the uniform lattice spacing @xmath99 here  @xcite @xmath100 can be considered to be a surface energy and an interfacial energy respectively .",
    "since @xmath101 is a second divided difference , the interfacial energy is small in regions where the strain is slowly varying .",
    "we obtain the _ local quasicontinuum energy _ by neglecting the interfacial energy and surface energy to obtain @xmath102 and we have the corresponding conjugate atomistic force @xmath103    we note that @xmath104 depends only on @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 this approximation is computationally feasible since the work to compute all the forces is proportional to n. the approximation error now has two components : the linearization within each element that is inherited from the constrained quasicontinuum approximation plus the operator error incurred by ignoring interfacial terms . in cases where the deformation gradient @xmath108 is slowly varying on the scale of the representative atom mesh , both sources of error will be small and the local approximation will be highly accurate , as is expected for a sufficiently refined finite element continuum model .",
    "mesh refinement can be used to reduce both sources of error , but even mesh refinement to the atomistic scale can not remove the interfacial error in the neighborhood of defects since the deformation gradient varies rapidly on the atomistic scale .",
    "thus , the atomistic model must be retained near defects to obtain sufficient accuracy .",
    "we can obtain a quasicontinuum approximation that is accurate in regions where the deformation gradient @xmath108 is rapidly varying , such as in the neighborhood of defects , and maintains the efficiency of the local quasicontinuum method by combining them in the _ force - based quasicontinuum _ approximation ( qcf ) . in qcf , we partition the chain into `` atomistic '' and `` continuum '' representative atoms and define the force on each representative atom to be the force that would result",
    "if the whole approximation was of its respective type , that is , @xmath109 with this convention , for example , the forces on a continuum representative atom are determined solely by the adjacent degrees of freedom regardless of how close any atomistic representative atoms may be .",

    "figure  [ qcchain ] depicts one end of the quasicontinuum chain .",
    "we note that the atomistic model has surface effects at the two ends of the chain , but the local quasicontinuum model does not have surface effects .",
    "thus , this arrangement of representative atoms with continuum representative atoms at the ends of the chain will not give surface effects within the qc approximation .",
