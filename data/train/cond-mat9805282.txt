    "one of the most remarkable results in statistical mechanics is the circle theorem of yang and lee @xcite who in 1952 established that zeroes of the partition function of the ferromagnetic ising model always lie on the unit circle in the complex @xmath7 plane , where @xmath8 is the reduced magnetic field variable . in 1964",
    "fisher @xcite pointed out that it is also meaningful to consider zeroes of the ising partition function in the complex temperature plane , in which the zeroes reside on a boundary at which the free energy becomes non - analytic .",
    "particularly , he showed that temperature zeroes of the square lattice ising model lie on two circles in the thermodynamic limit . since then the consideration of the partition function zeroes has become a power tool in analyzing lattice models .",
    "the temperature zeroes of the ising model @xcite as well as the potts model @xcite have been investigated .",
    "however , studies to this date have been confined mostly to results in the thermodynamic limit @xcite and/or numerical analyses @xcite .",
    "very little progress has been made for finite lattices , except in one dimension @xcite , in which the locations of zeroes are determined in a closed - form and analyzed algebraically .    in this paper",
    "we study the partition function zeroes of the ising model for a finite rectangular lattice with an asymmetric self - dual boundary condition .",
    "this study is motivated by a recently discovered numerical evidence in the case of self - dual potts models @xcite that many partition function zeroes lie precisely on the unit circle . here ,",
    "we explain why this is the case , and establish more generally the criterion for zeroes to occur on the unit circle for self - dual lattice models .",
    "particularly , for the ising model considered here , we show that all zeroes lie on two circles in the limit of @xmath2 and any @xmath3 .",
    "we also obtain closed - form expressions for the loci of zeroes for @xmath9 , as well as the density of zero distribution in the limit of @xmath4 .",

    "let the nearest - neighbor interaction be @xmath11 .",
    "further , introduce a boundary condition that all sites on one of the two horizontal boundaries , say , the lowermost one , interact with an additional site with the same interaction @xmath11 .",

    "this explains the numerical findings of @xcite that a large number of zeroes of self - dual potts partition functions are located on the unit circle .    for the self - dual ising model on @xmath6",

    "for @xmath67 the polynomial equation ( [ p ] ) can be solved only numerically .",

    "this is so since , otherwise , without the loss of generality we can assume @xmath135 and ( [ zeros ] ) yields @xmath136 which contradicts ( [ ss ] ) ( except at @xmath137 ) . thus we write @xmath138 where @xmath139 is real .",
    "then , ( [ ss ] ) becomes s + s^-1 = 2 + 2(1+)= real [ bound ] leading to the bound @xmath140 .",
    "for @xmath141 we must have @xmath92 which implies , by theorem 2(iii ) , that all zeroes are on the circle @xmath142 .",
    "for @xmath143 , the bound is equivalent to the bound ( [ sbound ] ) on @xmath66 and , by theorem 1(ii ) , all zeroes are on the unit circle @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore conclude that in the limit of @xmath110 all zeroes are on the two circles @xmath71 and @xmath142 .",
    "indeed , this coincides with the finding of fisher @xcite who showed that , in the limit of both @xmath144 , the partition function zeroes are on the two equivalent circles @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "however , our result is more general and holds for @xmath110 and any @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we remark that our results confirm the conjecture put forth in @xcite , that all zeroes in the @xmath146 half plane are on the unit circle @xmath71 . but",
    "a generally proof of this conjecture is still lacking at this point .",
    "we have obtained the closed - form expression of the partition function of an @xmath0 rectangular ising lattice with an asymmetric boundary condition , and evaluated its zeroes .",
    "it was found that the zeroes are given by the roots of the polynomial equation ( [ p ] ) .",

    "we also established that all zeroes lie on two unit circles centered respectively at @xmath148 in the @xmath2 limit for any @xmath3 , where @xmath149 .",
    "numerical results for finite @xmath10 are also presented .",
    "work has been supported in part by national science foundation grant dmr-9614170 .",
    "for completeness we include in this appendix an outline of the steps leading to expressing the graph generating function @xmath150 as a pfaffian . first , following standard procedures @xcite we see that the graph generating function @xmath150 for @xmath16 is equal to the dimer generating function for a `` bathroom - tile '' lattice constructed from @xmath16 as shown in fig .",
