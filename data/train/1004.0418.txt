    "<S> we show that models with deformations of special relativity that have an energy - dependent speed of light have non - local effects . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement that the arising non - locality is not in conflict with known particle physics allows us to derive strong bounds on deformations of special relativity and rule out a modification to first order in energy over the planck mass .    </S>",
    "<S> modifications of special relativity have recently obtained increased attention since measurements of gamma ray bursts observed by the fermi space telescope have now reached a precision high enough to test an energy - dependence of the speed of light to first order in the photon s energy over the planck mass @xcite . while such modifications could also be caused by an actual breaking of lorentz - invariance that introduces a preferred frame , lorentz - invariance breaking is subject to many other constraints already @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this makes deformations of special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite , that preserve observer - independence and do not introduce a preferred frame , the prime candidate for an energy - dependent speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> we will here show that dsr necessitates violations of locality that put a bound on an energy - dependent speed of light that is 23 orders of magnitude stronger than the recent measurements of gamma ray bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we will use units in which @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> dsr is motivated by finding modified lorentz - transformations that allow the energy associated to the planck mass , @xmath1 , to remain invariant under action of the transformations . in the cases of dsr </S>",
    "<S> we will examine , the speed of light is a function of energy @xmath2 , such that this function is the same for all observers . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in a different restframe where @xmath3 was transformed into @xmath4 under the deformed lorentz - transformation , the speed of light would be @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this invariance of the functional behavior of the now energy - dependent speed of light is the key point of dsr , and the modified transformations are constructed such that the function @xmath2 can indeed remain invariant under a change of reference frame , which would not be the case under ordinary lorentz - transformations .    </S>",
    "<S> the modified transformations are commonly derived by requiring the invariance of a modified dispersion relation @xcite from which the speed of light can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> these transformations were originally considered for momentum space </S>",
    "<S> . however , the claim that dsr makes predictions for the propagation of photons from gamma ray bursts clearly employs the energy - dependence of the speed of light in position space . </S>",
    "<S> we will in the following show that the requirement of an energy - dependent _ and _ observer - independent speed of light in position space results in an observer - dependence of what it means for two events to be at the same point in space and time . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a violation of locality in the sense that two observers in relative motion to each other can not agree on whether two events at the same point , and this disagreement is macroscopic even for moderate relative velocities resulting in an inconsistent definition of space - time location that is in conflict with already established physics . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that this problem does not occur in theories with an energy - dependent speed of light that actually break lorentz - invariance . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the functional form of @xmath2 will not remain invariant under a change of reference frame .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a gamma ray burst ( grb ) at distance @xmath6  gpc that , for simplicity , has no motion relative to a laboratory where it is detected . </S>",
    "<S> this source emits a photon with @xmath7  gev which arrives in the lab restframe at @xmath8 inside a detector . </S>",
    "<S> together with the 10 gev photon there is a low energetic reference photon emitted . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of that photon can be as low as wanted .    in the dsr - scenario we are considering the phase velocity depends on the photons energy . </S>",
    "<S> to first order c(e ) ( 1 + ) + o ( )  , [ alpha ] [ cofe ] where we will neglect corrections of order higher than @xmath9 in the following . </S>",
    "<S> the important point is that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cofe ] ) is supposed to be observer - independent , such that it has the same form in every reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> this then requires the non - linear , deformed lorentz - transformations in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> four our purposes it is sufficient to know that the lorentz - transformations receive to lowest order a correction in @xmath10 . to ease the discussion we consider the case @xmath11 such that the speed of light decreases with increasing energy . </S>",
    "<S> the argument however does not depend on the sign .    </S>",
    "<S> the higher energetic photon is slowed down and arrives later than the lower energetic one . </S>",
    "<S> one has for the difference @xmath12 between the arrival times of the high and low energetic photon t = l ( - 1 ) = l + o ( )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ deltat ] with 4 gpc @xmath13  m , @xmath14 , the delay is of the order 1 second . strictly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , we should take into account the cosmological redshift since the photon propagates in a time - dependent background . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the purpose of estimating the effect it will suffice to consider a static background , since using the proper general relativistic expression does not change the result by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> we further consider an electron at @xmath15  mev emitted from a source in the detector s vicinity such that it arrives together with the high - energetic photon at @xmath8 inside the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energetic photon leaves the grb together with the high - energetic photon at @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it arrives in the detector at @xmath17 , by @xmath18 earlier than the electron . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen the emission time such that @xmath19 in the lab frame and the electron arrives with the same delay after the low energetic photon as the high energetic photon . with an energy of 10  mev , </S>",
    "<S> the electron is relativistic already , but any possible energy - dependent dsr effect is at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the photon , and due to the electron s nearby emission the effects can not accumulate over a long distance . </S>",
    "<S> the electron s velocity is @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> inside the detector at @xmath21 the photon scatters off the electron . </S>",
    "<S> the photon changes the momentum of the electron , which triggers a bomb and the lab blows up . </S>",
    "<S> that is of course completely irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> it only matters that the elementary scattering process can cause an irreversible and macroscopic change . </S>",
    "<S> this setup is depicted in figure [ 1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us consider a team of physicists in a satellite moving towards the grb who observe and try to describe the processes in the lab . </S>",
    "<S> we will denote the coordinates of that restframe with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the satellite crosses the lab just when the bomb blows off at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the typical speed of a satellite relative to earth - bound laboratories is @xmath23 km / s , and @xmath24 for the relative motion between lab and satellite . in the satellite frame </S>",
    "<S> , the electron s and photons energies are blueshifted . </S>",
    "<S> we have e_&= & e_+ o ( )  , and the energy of the very low energetic photon remains very low energetic . in the satellite frame </S>",
    "<S> the time passing between the arrival of the low energetic reference photon at the satellite and the electron at @xmath25 is t_a =  .    with higher energy , the speed of the electron increases . </S>",
    "<S> the speed of the photon also changes but , and here is the problem , according to dsr the function @xmath26 is _ observer - independent_. in the satellite frame one then has    c ( e_ ) = 1 - = 1 - + o ( )  , and the distance the photons travel is @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the time passing between the arrival of the low - energetic and the high - energetic photon in the satellite is t = l = t + o ( )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ dt ] the question arises whether there could also be some energy - dependence in the transformation of @xmath28 in position - space . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss this possibility later . with the above , in the satellite frame </S>",
    "<S> the high energetic photon thus arrives later than the electron by t - t_a = ( - ) t + o ( )  . inserting @xmath29 for @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , one finds t - t_a -3 t ( v_s - v_s^2/2 ) 10 ^ -5 t  . in the satellite frame , </S>",
    "<S> depicted in figure [ 2 ] , the high energetic photon thus misses the electron by @xmath31 seconds , and is still lagging behind as much as a kilometer when it arrives in the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the photon then can not scatter off the electron in the detector , and the electron can not trigger the bomb to blow up the lab . </S>",
    "<S> the physicists in the satellite are puzzled .    </S>",
    "<S> , as seen from the satellite frame . </S>",
    "<S> the highly energetic photon is slowed down further and does not meet the electron in the detector.,width=264 ]    an assumption we implicitly made for this derivation was that the quantum mechanical space- and time - uncertainties @xmath32 are not modified in dsr , such that the gev photon can be considered peaked to a @xmath33 smaller than the distance to the electron at arrival .    </S>",
    "<S> whether or not the wave function spreads in dsr depends on the interpretation of the modified dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> it is supposed to describe the propagation of a particle in a background with quantum gravitational effects . </S>",
    "<S> yet the question is whether this modification should be understood as one for a plane wave or for a localized superposition of plane waves already . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> a wave - packet would experience enhanced dispersion , in the latter case not . in the absence of a derivation , both seems plausible , so let us just examine the possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> there either is a modification , or there is not . </S>",
    "<S> the above covered the case without modification .    in case </S>",
    "<S> there is a modification caused by a dispersion of the wave - packet , then the uncertainty of the slowed down , high energetic photon at arrival would be vastly larger than the maximal localization of the heisenberg limit allows . </S>",
    "<S> if one starts with a gaussian wave - packet localized to a width of @xmath34 at emission and tracks its spread with the modified dispersion relation , one finds that to first order the now time - dependent width is ( t ) = _ 0  . </S>",
    "<S> if we start with a width of @xmath35 , then for @xmath36 one has @xmath37 . or , in other words , in the worst case the uncertainty of the wave - packet at arrival was about the same size as the time delay @xmath38 and the photon would at arrival be smeared out over some hundred thousand kilometers . </S>",
    "<S> a delay of @xmath12 with an uncertainty of @xmath12 is hard to detect , but it would also be impossible to find out whether or not the center of the wave - packet had been dislocated by a factor five orders of magnitude smaller than the width of the wave - packet .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the problem was caused by the unusual transformation behavior of @xmath12 . to entirely hide this behavior , the quantum mechanical uncertainty @xmath33 needed to be much larger than the delay @xmath39 in all restframes , such that it was practically unfeasible to ever detect a tiny difference in probability with the photons </S>",
    "<S> we can receive , say , in the lifetime of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , let us boost into a reference frame with @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the inequality that needs to be fulfilled to hide the delay @xmath42 is then equivalent to @xmath43 , which is clearly violated without even requiring extreme boosts . to put in some numbers , for an observer in rest with the electron one has @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for @xmath47 , the requirement to hide the delay takes the form @xmath48 , which is also clearly violated . </S>",
    "<S> though in this case the delay does not actually get much larger than the uncertainty , they both approach the same value . </S>",
    "<S> we would then be comparing the probability of interaction at the center of the wave - packet with one at a distance comparable to its width . </S>",
    "<S> this would require several photons to get a proper statistic , but it is a difference in probability that is feasible to measure within the lifetime of the universe , and thus is still in conflict with observer - independence </S>",
    "<S> . let us point out that we have considered here a photon whose approximate momentum uncertainty at emission is comparable to the mean value , which is quite large already . </S>",
    "<S> if the photon s momentum had instead a smaller uncertainty , e.g. @xmath49  mev only , then the mismatch in timescales was by two orders of magnitude larger .    to keep track of our assumptions </S>",
    "<S> , we used normal lorentz - boosts to calculate the time span @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on already available data since the transformation behavior under lorentz - boosts has been tested to high precision in particle physics experiments @xcite . for the time - dilatation in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the decay - time of muons is known to transform as @xmath51 up to a @xmath52-factor of 30 to a precision of one per mille @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the logic of the here presented argument is as follows . if there was a delay of the order 1 second for the 10 gev photon caused by an energy - dependent speed of light , then the requirement of observer - independence results in violations of locality that are in conflict with experiment already . </S>",
    "<S> note that it is not necessary to actually perform the above sketched experiment in all reference frames , since observer - independence allows us to use cross - sections measured in our laboratories . </S>",
    "<S> this means in turn one can now use the knowledge of qed processes combined with the measurements of lorentz - boosts to constrain the possibility of there being such a dsr modification by requiring the resulting mismatch in arrival times not to result in any conflict with existing measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> the distance @xmath53 some gpc is as high as we can plausibly get in our universe , and the @xmath54 gev photon is as high as we have reliable observational data from particles traveling that far . </S>",
    "<S> the center of mass energy of the electron and the high energetic photon is @xmath55  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the process thus probes distances of @xmath56  fm . </S>",
    "<S> if the photon and the electron were closer already than the distance their scattering process probes , we would not have a problem . requiring @xmath57  fm for boosts up to </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 leads to a bound on the delay between the low and high energetic photon of t < 10 ^ -23 s , or , if we reinsert @xmath59 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ alpha ] ) , @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this covers both cases , the one with and without spread of the wave - packet .    </S>",
    "<S> we have here not discussed all possible constraints that one could consider , for example different scattering processes and their exact precision . </S>",
    "<S> we see now that this is not necessary , since the ratio @xmath9 is @xmath61 . with the above constraint , we are thus already in the regime where second order modifications would become important . </S>",
    "<S> the here used analysis however made use of the scaling in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dt ] ) and thus does not in this way apply to the second order modifications . </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude however that present - day observations do already rule out a modification in the speed of light to first order in the energy over planck mass .    to retrace our steps </S>",
    "<S> , the problem stems from the transformation behavior of @xmath12 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is a direct consequence of requiring the energy - dependent speed of light @xmath26 to be observer - independent , together with applying a normal , passive , lorentz - transformation to convert the distance @xmath28 into the satellite restframe .    </S>",
    "<S> the formulation of dsr in position space has been under debate . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that the space - time metric and also the lorentz - transformations in position space should become energy - dependent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now if one would use a modified transformation also on the coordinates , a transformation depending on the energy of the photon , then @xmath12 might transform properly and both particles would meet also in the satellite frame . </S>",
    "<S> this would require that the transformation of the distance @xmath28 was modified such that it converted the troublesome transformation behavior of @xmath12 back into a normal lorentz - transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> this would imply that the distance between any two objects would depend on the energy of a photon that happened to propagate between them . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the grb and the detector was then energy - dependent such that it got shortened in the right amount to allow the slower photon to arrive in time together with the electron . that however would mean that the speed of the photon would not depend on its energy when expressed in our usual low - energetic and energy - independent coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the confusion here stems from having defined a speed from the dispersion relation without that speed a priori having any meaning in position space . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility thus just reaffirms that observer - independence requires the speed of light to be constant .    </S>",
    "<S> that dsr implies a frame - dependent meaning of what is `` near '' was mentioned already in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> serious conceptual problems arising from this were pointed out in @xcite , and here we have demonstrated a conflict with experiment to very high precision . if dsr was indeed the origin of time - delays of highly energetic photons from grbs , then it would also lead to macroscopic effects we would long have observed . consequently , dsr can not be cause of observable effects in grb spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> dsr is motivated by the idea that the planck energy should be observer - independent which then leads to deformed lorentz - transformations and an energy - dependent speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> we have here seen that such an energy - dependent speed of light that is also observer - independent implies violations of locality that are strongly constrained by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it has however been argued in @xcite that the requirement of the planck scale being observer - independent does not necessitate it to be an invariant of lorentz - boosts , since the result of such a boost does not itself constitute an observation . </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient that experiments made are in agreement over that scale . in particular </S>",
    "<S> if the planck length plays the role of a fundamentally minimal length no process should be able to resolve shorter distances . </S>",
    "<S> this does require a modification of interactions in quantum field theory at very high center - of - mass energies and small impact parameters , but it does not necessitate a modification of lorentz - boosts for free particles . in these models </S>",
    "<S> the speed of light remains constant .    </S>",
    "<S> an extended version of the here presented argument and further discussion can be found in @xcite . </S>"
