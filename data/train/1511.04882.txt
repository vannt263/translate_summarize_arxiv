    "newtorites were proposed in 1984 by bernard , de rujula and lautrup @xcite . in this case",
    "the excitation of a bar detector is due directly to the newtonian force and the signals are very small because the newtonian force is extremely weak .",
    "we will focus on the nautilus and explorer detectors that our group operated for decades .",
    "we will describe the analysis procedure and the selection criteria to identify candidate events .",
    "then , starting from the energy distributions of the candidates events we will present upper limits to newtorites .",

    "nautilus started operations around 1998 .",
    "the current run started in 2003 .",
    "the detector explorer , similar to nautilus , was located in cern ( geneva - ch ) .",
    "the explorer run ended in june 2010 .",
    "both detectors use the same principles of operation .",
    "explorer and nautilus consist of a large aluminum alloy cylinder ( 3 m long , 0.6 m diameter ) suspended in vacuum by a cable around its central section to reduce the seismic and acoustic noise and cooled to about 2 k by means of a superfluid helium bath .",

    "this resonator is part of a capacitive electro - mechanical transducer that produces an electrical a.c .",
    "current that is proportional to the displacement between the secondary resonator and the bar end face .",
    "such current is then amplified by means of a dcsquid superconductive device and recorded on disk with an adc sampled at 5khz .",
    "both detectors are equipped with cosmic ray telescopes to veto excitations due to large showers .",
    "the data are processed off - line , applying adaptive frequency domain filters optimized for short delta - like signals . in order to select clean events",
    "we have applied several cuts to the data .",
    "the most important cuts are based on : the noise ( average of the output in 10 minutes periods ) , the gain of the electronic chain , the squid locking working point , the seismic monitors , the event shape .",
    "we have removed also periods with an high event rates and runs having live - time less than 10h .",
    "the efficiency of those cuts is verified continuously using the extensive air showers detected by the cosmic ray detector .",
    "we have used only the nautilus data to give newtorite upper limits .",
    "we have used the full data set , including explorer , to give upper limits to _ macro _ particles .",
    "the total live - time of the nautilus data set is 1846 days .",

    "due to the long range nature of the newtonian force , newtorite signals could occur even if the particle does not cross the bar . in the case of a point like",

    "we are only interested in the first longitudinal mode n=1 , and we assume that the velocity @xmath7 of the particle is large enough that most of the signal is contained in a few ms .",
    "this requirement is due to the @xmath22-like filter used to extract the antenna events .",
    "different filters could in principle detect longer signals .",
    "the signal is a fairly complicated function of the newtorite s trajectory and has been computed in @xcite in the particular case of orthogonal trajectory in the middle of the bar , and for @xmath23 . in this case",
    "we can put @xmath24 and we obtain : @xmath25\\ ] ] numerically we have for nautilus @xmath26 k with @xmath27 expressed in kg and @xmath7 in km / s .    in the general case",
    "the signal has been computed by numerical integration of eq.[eq : anewton ] inserted in a montecarlo to simulate random directions .",
    "the result of one of those calculations as a function of the distance of the trajectory from the bar center and for @xmath3=10 kg  s / km is shown in fig  [ figedist ] . from this figure",
    "we can see that , at large distance d , the signal energy scales as 1/d@xmath28 , as expected from eq.[eq : anewton ] .",
    "the signal falls below the energy threshold used in this analysis ( see the next paragraphs ) for d larger than @xmath29 3 m for @xmath3=10 kg  s / km . for @xmath3=100 kg",
    "s / km this threshold occurs at @xmath30 10 m.    as a consequence , it is more important to select data with very low noise than to increase the livetime . in tab .",

    "the limits are also shown in fig.[limitinewt2 ] for two values of the velocity @xmath7 = 10 and 300 km / s .",
    "our limit , although very far from the dm expected density ( @xmath32 ) , could be of some interest due to the lack of other experimental limits derived from the direct detection of dm particles that only interact gravitationally and on the earth .",
    "there are several limits obtained studying the motion of celestial body in the solar system .",
    "for example adler @xcite obtains a direct upper limit of the mass of earth - bound dark matter lying between the radius of the moon orbit and the geodetic satellite orbit .",
    "the value obtained is @xmath33 , larger than our limit shown in fig.[limitinewt2 ] .",
    "considering larger volumes pitjev @xcite has found a limit for possible dm inside the earth - sun orbits of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "our direct limit on newtorites could be improved by orders of magnitude using two or more nearby bar antennas in coincidence .",
    "the performances for newtorites of two antenna in coincidence have been studied by a montecarlo simulation that uses as input the nautilus 2011 data set ( therefore assuming the same performances of nautilus 2011 ) . in the montecarlo we assumed two antennas , positioned 1.5 m apart , with uncorrelated noise .",
    "larger distances , up to tens of meters , can still produce a detectable signal , depending on the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the result of this study is that a gain of about 300 seems to be possible in 10 years of operations with noise similar to that of nautilus 2011 .",
    "this gain is not enough to reach the pitjev bound . to reach this",
    "bound it is necessary to increase the number of antennas and to reduce their noise .",
    "we recall that the current antenna noise is limited by technology and is far from the intrinsic quantum limit of this kind of device @xmath35 joules .",
    "so a large r&d effort would be necessary to approach this limit .",
    "the possibility to detect newtorites in the @xmath0 interferometric detector has been discussed by v. frolov in a talk at the gwdaw 2014 conference in takayama ( japan ) .",
    "the detection is based on the measurement of an acceleration on the mirrors .",
    "the best acceleration sensitivity in the aligo interferometer optimized at low frequency is around @xmath36 at 20hz to be compared to @xmath37 for a newtorite mass of @xmath291 kg at a distance of 7 km .",
    "study are in progress to evaluate the signal to noise ratio using signal templates .",
    "much better prospects are for the planned et interferometer having a better sensitivity and the possibility of coincidences between the three interferometers .",
    "finally it s important to note that interesting limits can be obtained with the @xmath0 bar data for other exotic particles , like the _ macro _ particles .",
    "an allowed region for the _ macro _ dark matter can be obtained in the plane cross section vs. mass , by excluding the region with upper limit on the flux smaller than the dark matter flux , following the approach of ref  @xcite .",
