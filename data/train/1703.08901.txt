    "the spectral features of agns ( active galactic nuclei ) are observed in different ways since the nucleus can be obscured by an optically thick dust torus @xcite . according to the simplest agn unification model ,",
    "the observed physical properties show differences due to the orientation effect , which depends on the angle between the line - of - sight and the axis of the dust torus @xcite .",
    "if we directly observe the inner part of an agn , a blue agn continuum from an accretion disk and broad emission lines originated from the broad - line region ( blr ) are present in the optical spectral range .",
    "in contrast , if the dust torus obscures the inner part of an agn , we observe narrow emission lines originated from the photoionized narrow - line region ( nlr ) , without the direct detection of a blue agn continuum and broad emission lines .",
    "if the fwhm of the broad emission line , e.g. , h@xmath10  and h@xmath0 , is larger than 1000 km s@xmath6 , agns are typically classified as type 1 agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for which the kinematics of gas in the blr can be used to trace the gravitational potential of the central supermassive black hole for determining black hole mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the relativistic effect can also produce gravitational redshift causing velocity shift of the broad emission lines , as the blr gas has orbital velocity corresponding to a few percent of the speed of light ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when agn luminosity is relatively low , however , the emission from host galaxy dilutes agn emission , consequently dominating in the observed spectra .",
    "thus , either a blue agn continuum or broad emission lines can be missed from detection if no careful analysis is performed . in particular , a weak broad h@xmath0  emission line from the blr can be easily undetected if the narrow h@xmath0  emission originated from the nlr and/or star forming region is very strong .",
    "consequently , these low luminosity agns may be mis - classified as type 2 agns or star forming galaxies instead of type 1 agns .",
    "previous studies by @xcite and @xcite , for example , showed that by decomposing the broad and narrow components in the h@xmath0  line profile , a hidden population of type 1 agns can be identified among emission line galaxies ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the hidden population of type 1 agns is important to constrain the agn unification model and to characterize dust torus since the empirical number ratio between type 1 and type 2 agns is a key to understand the orientation effect @xcite although it is difficult to overcome the different bias and systematic difference in selecting type 1 and type 2 agns .",
    "searching for intermediate mass black holes , other studies examined the h@xmath0  line profile to investigate the presence of a broad h@xmath0  component and identified type 1 agns @xcite .",
    "hidden type 1 agns are characterized with low luminosity and low eddington ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the optical continuum mainly represents stellar population while narrow emission lines , e.g. , [ ] @xmath95007 , are similar to those of type 2 agns .",
    "compared to typical type 1 agns , these hidden type 1 agns have advantage in studying their host galaxies and investigating the coevolution of black holes and galaxies by constraining the black hole mass scaling relations .",
    "for example , while it is very difficult to measure stellar velocity dispersion or bulge mass of type 1 agn host galaxies due to the high flux ratios between agns and stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is easy to measure the properties of host galaxies if the agn continuum is weak @xcite .",
    "thus these agns can be utilized to investigate the black hole - galaxy scaling relations and their evolution @xcite .    in our pilot study @xcite , we searched hidden type 1 agns among emission line galaxies at z @xmath20.05 , by carefully investigating the presence of a broad component in the h@xmath0  emission line profile , using a large sample of @xmath124,000 type 2 agns based on sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release ( dr ) 7 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend our previous work by enlarging the survey volume out to z=0.1 , and improving the detection scheme for the broad component in h@xmath0 .",
    "based on the newly identified sample of type 1 agns with a broad h@xmath0  component , we investigate the m@xmath11-@xmath12  relation , the kinematics of ionized gas outflows , and the effect of gravitational redshift .",

    "discussion is given in section 6 and summary and conclusions follow in section 7 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the cosmological parameters as @xmath13  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we utilized the type 2 agn catalog by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which identified type 2 agns at 0.02@xmath2z@xmath20.1 , in order to search hidden type 1 agns .",
    "the sample is selected based on a couple of criteria : signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n)@xmath163 for the four emission lines , namely , h@xmath10 , [ ] @xmath17 , h@xmath0 , and [ ] @xmath18 from the mpa - jhu catalog for sdss dr7 galaxies @xcite . using the flux ratios of these four emission lines @xcite and the demarcation line for separating agns from star - forming galaxies @xcite , 23,517 type 2 agns ( pure agns and composite objects)were identified with the amplitude - to - noise ratio > 5 for [ ] and h@xmath0 .",
    "more details of the selection procedure can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    to identify hidden type 1 agns among type 2 agns , we first subtract stellar continuum by fitting sdss spectra using the penalized pixel - fitting code ( ppxf ) @xcite , which find the best - fit stellar population model of the given galaxy spectrum .",
    "we use miles simple stellar population models with solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "in addition to the optical emission lines , we mask the continuum around the h@xmath0  region ( 6300 @xmath1 6900  ) to prevent the stellar population model from fitting a potential broad component as a stellar continuum .    after subtracting the best - fit stellar population model , we investigate whether a broad h@xmath0  component is present around the h@xmath0  region by visually inspecting the residual spectra ( i.e. , emission - line spectra ) . in this process",

    ", we need a reliable emission line decomposition process since the h@xmath0  region is complex due to the blending of the narrow h@xmath0  and the [ ] doublet as well as the broad h@xmath0  component if present .",
    "therefore , we use three different fitting approaches for the h@xmath0  region as follows : ( a ) if the narrow emission lines do not show particular wing components and if there is no broad h@xmath0  component , we use a single gaussian model for each of the h@xmath0  and two [ ] lines . in case of the [ ] doublet",
    ", we fix their centers and flux ratio at their theoretical value while we use the same line width ; ( b ) if wing components are present in the narrow emission lines ( h@xmath0  and [ ] doublet ) , we utilize a double gaussian model ( one for a core component and the other for a wing component ) to account for outflow kinematics in the nlr as we used for typical type 2 agns @xcite ( c ) if a very broad h@xmath0  component with fwhm > 1000 km s@xmath6  is present , we add a single gaussian component or a gauss - hermite component depending on whether this component is symmetric or asymmetric . for the broad and narrow h@xmath0  components , we use free parameters for the line centers , widths and amplitudes .    for the total sample , we first apply model ( a ) and identify type 1 agn candidates by visually inspecting whether the model - subtracted spectra show a significantly high residual around the h@xmath0  region . note that the residual can be present due to a very broad h@xmath0  component or wing components of the narrow h@xmath0  and [ ] lines . for these type 1 agn candidates , we then apply either model ( b ) or ( c ) depending on the line profile of the [ ]  doublet .",
    "if the [ ]  doublet shows wing components based on a single gaussian fit and visual inspection , then we apply model ( b ) by including a wing component for each of h@xmath0  and [ ] , while we use model ( c ) only if both model ( a ) and ( b ) do not provide an acceptable fit ( i.e. , a significant residual is present based on visual inspection ) . in this process , we conservatively identify type 1 agns only for the case with model ( c ) in order to avoid false detection of the broad h@xmath0  component . in total , we obtained 611 type 1 agns with a broad h@xmath0  lines with fwhm > 1000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "note that we use fwhm @xmath4 1000 km s@xmath6as a lower limit of the broad h@xmath0  line width as a conventional definiton of type 1 agns @xcite since a h@xmath0  line narrower than 1000 km s@xmath6  may not be originated from the blr . in figure 1",

    "it is not clear what is the origin of this discrepancy .",
    "a systematic comparison of the outflow fraction between type 1 and type 2 agns is yet to be available .",
    "the detection of a wing component in [ ] is more difficult for lower luminosity agns since the wing component can be easily diluted by noise .",
    "thus , the outflow fraction of the low luminosity agns should be regarded as a minimum ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we note that our hidden type 1 agn sample is far from complete at low luminosity , since a broad h@xmath0  component will be much weaker and easily missed in identifying type 1 agns .",
    "therefore , we interpret the difference of the outflow fraction at low luminosity is insignificant .",
    "the outflow fraction also increases as eddington ratio increases albeit with a shallower slope . over the eddington ratio range covered by our sample ,",
    "i.e. , log @xmath69 = -2.5 to -1.5 , the outflow fraction increases from @xmath130% to @xmath150% .",
    "these results indicate that ionized gas outflows are directly connected to agn activity and the outflow properties are qualitatively similar between type 1 and type 2 agns .",
    "the velocity of blr gas is relatively high up to several percent of the speed of light , suggesting that the the broad lines can be redshifted due to relativistic effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to investigate the gravitational redshift using the newly identified type 1 agns",
    ", we calculate the velocity shift of the broad h@xmath0  with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "in contrast to typical type 1 agns , for which systemic velocity can not be accurately measured @xcite , we are able to use the luminosity - weighted stellar absorption lines to determine the systemic velocity since agn continuum is too weak to dilute stellar absorption lines .",
    "thus , we can decrease the systematic effect in measuring velocity shift of broad emission lines caused by the large uncertainty in systemic velocity .    in figure 10",
    ", we present the velocity shift of the broad h@xmath0  line as a function of the line width of h@xmath0 .",
    "the mean velocity shift is 115 @xmath5 389 km s@xmath6  while 427 out of 611 agns show a redshifted h@xmath0  ( @xmath1 70% ) , which may be interpreted as the gravitational redshift although the velocity shift may be also caused by other mechanisms such as non - gravitational kinematics ( i.e. , inflows and outflows ) or orbital motions @xcite .",
    "note that the other 1/3 of the sample shows a blueshifted h@xmath0 .",
    "we find several extreme objects with a very large blue shift ( @xmath2 -1000 km s@xmath6 ) and a large velocity dispersion , while the h@xmath0  line profile is very asymmetric .",
    "the nature of these objects is unclear and beyond the scope of the current study .    using the sdss quasar sample , @xcite statistically investigated the velocity shift of h@xmath10  to compare with the prediction of their blr geometry models .",
    "the [ ] narrow emission line was used to calculate the systemic velocity since stellar absorption lines are not detected due to strong agn continuum . comparing with their result ( figure 1 in @xcite ) , we obtain a similar result within the observed range of the broad h@xmath0  velocity dispersion @xmath2 @xmath13000 km s@xmath6  in our sample .",
    "the geometry of the blr is often assumed with spherical or disk models , and these models predict that the effect of the gravitational redshift increases with the blr gas velocity @xcite . by taking the expected velocity shift of the broad h@xmath0  as v@xmath30 = 1.5@xmath70 based on a spherical model of blr from @xcite ,",
    "we compare the observed mean velocity shift with the prediction as a function of the line dispersion of broad h@xmath0 .",
    "although there is a large scatter of velocity shift for given velocity dispersion , the trend of the mean velocity shift is consistent with the model , suggesting that the observed velocity shift is consistent with the gravitational redshift effect .",
    "the red square symbols represent the mean value in each bin while the blue dashed line represents the expected velocity shift based on the spherical model of the blr . ]",
    "doublet clearly shows a wing feature ( blue lines ) , double gaussian models ( blue + red ) provide a reasonable fit for the h@xmath0  region ( top panel ) , demonstrating that a broad h@xmath0  component is not required once we include a wing component in the narrow line profile .",
    "bottom panel shows that for some objects , a single gaussian model provide a good fit for all narrow lines ( i.e. , h@xmath0 , [ ] , and [ ] ) , ]    component ( blue line in the left panel ) , the area ratio is less than 2 since the noise area ( blue section ) is relatively large due to the high noise level ( @xmath71 ) ( right panel ) .",
    "the area ratio is defined by the wing of the broad h@xmath0  model ( grey + blue sections ) divided by the noise area ( blue section ) , for which the height is determined base on the continuum noise level . ]",
    "although the presence of broad emission lines is a characteristic of optical type 1 agns , in some cases it is difficult to detect broad lines due to obscuration in the optical spectral range ( e.g. , red agns ) or intrinsically low luminosity diluted by host galaxy emission ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "several studies tried to find hidden type 1 agns using different methods .",
    "for example , using the sdss dr2 catalogue , @xcite found 63 objects ( 1.8% of total galaxies ) , which have a relatively broad h@xmath0  line based on visual inspection .",
    "similar works by @xcite and @xcite reported the detection of hidden type 1 agns using sdss dr7 .",
    "we compare the selection methods and results between our work and the previous studies . in our pilot study @xcite",
    ", we identified type 1 agns at 0.02@xmath2z@xmath20.05 by detecting a broad component in the h@xmath0  line profile . using the same type 2 agn catalogue , we extend our previous work out to z=0.1 , enlarging the sample size from 142 to 611 objects",
    "however , we note that the selection scheme is improved based on the revised spectral decomposition and visual inspection . for example , we model the h@xmath0  region more carefully using 3 different cases as described in section 2.2 , while @xcite used a simple fitting scheme using one broad and one narrow components for h@xmath0 .",
    "thus , readers are suggested to use the results in this extended work .",
    "@xcite searched type 1 agns among emission line galaxies at z@xmath20.2 using the sdss dr7 catalogue .",
    "first , they used the flux ratio at two narrow band regions , respectively representing a broad h@xmath0  ( 6523 - 6543 ) and continuum ( 6460 - 6480 ) , to trace the presence of a broad h@xmath0  component .",
    "this flux ratio @xmath72 is useful to find broad h@xmath0  candidates since it increases as the broad h@xmath0  line becomes more prominent .",
    "combining the signal - to - statistical noise ( defined from continuum spectral range ) and the flux ratio @xmath72 , they defined the 1@xmath22 demarcation line to select type 1 agn candidates ( see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "second , they used the area flux ratio , which is defined by the area of the red wing of the broad h@xmath0  component , after excluding the [ ] @xmath736584 emission line ( see the blue + grey area in figure 12 ) , divided by the noise area defined with the 1@xmath74 noise level of the continuum ( blue area in figure 12 ) , in order to avoid unreliable detection of a broad h@xmath0 . only if the area flux ratio is larger than 2 , then they classified a target as type 1 agns . using these criteria",
    ", they identified 1611 type 1 agns at z < 0.1 . among these agns ,",
    "882 objects are sdss specclass =3 objects , which are already classified as type 1 agns in the sdss , while the other 729 objects are sdss specclass = 2 ( i.e. , galaxy ) objects .",
    "thus , they found 729 hidden type 1 agns among type 2 or star forming galaxies by detecting a broad h@xmath0 , while in our study we found 611 type 1 agns from our type 2 agn catalogue .    among 729 type 1 agns identified by @xcite , 230 objects are overlapped with our sample of 611 type 1 agns , while the other 499 objects are not identified as type 1 agns in our study .",
    "when we examine these 499 objects , the majority of them ( 412 objects ) are located in the star forming region in the bpt diagram .",
    "since we only used the type 2 agn catalogue to search hidden type 1 agns , we simply did not investigate these 412 agns .",
    "the remaining 87 objects were not classified as type 1 agns in our study since a broad h@xmath0  component was not required to fit the h@xmath0  region .",
    "instead , we were able to fit h@xmath0  and [ ] with double gaussian models for the majority of these objects ( 70 objects , see the top panel in figure 11 ) or single gaussian models provide a good fit for 7 objects ( see the bottom panel in figure 11 ) .",
    "for some cases ( 10 objects ) , the noise in the vicinity of h@xmath0  region is too large to decide whether single or double gaussian models provide a better fit .",
    "note that in our fitting procedure we often used double gaussian models whenever a wing component in the narrow line profile is required .",
    "in particular , since we also examined the line profile of the [ ] doublet , in order to check whether a wing component is necessary to fit the narrow component of h@xmath0  and [ ] lines , we tried to avoid a false detection of fitting the wing components of narrow lines as a broad h@xmath0  component .",
    "in contrast , @xcite used single gaussian models for narrow h@xmath0  and [ ] lines , hence they may have treated the wing components of the narrow lines as a broad h@xmath0  component . in fact , the [ ] line profile clearly shows the presence of a wing component for @xmath1a half of these objects ( 43/87 ) as demonstrated in figure 11 ( top panel ) .",
    "since we used a double gaussian profile for narrow lines ( h@xmath0 , [ ] , and [ ] ) , our fitting method for detecting a broad component of h@xmath0  seems to be more conservative than that of @xcite .",
    "we also investigate why 315 objects among 611 objects in our hidden type 1 agn sample were not classified as type 1 agns by @xcite .",
    "many of them were excluded due to the area ratio criterion by @xcite .",
    "for example , when we apply the area ratio cut defined by @xcite to the 315 agns , 136 objects do not satisfy the criterion while in the current study we conservatively concluded that a broad h@xmath0  is present ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "in particular , if the noise level is relatively large , the area flux ratio becomes below 2 , hence , these agns will be rejected by the criterion defined by @xcite . in figure 12",
    "we demonstrate two cases , each of which clearly shows a broad h@xmath0  component in visual inspection while the area flux ratio does not satisfy the criterion ( i.e. , ratio@xmath22 ) .",
    "in addition , if the broad h@xmath0  is blueshifted , the area ratio becomes also smaller since the area defined in the red side of the h@xmath0  becomes smaller . for the remaining 179 objects among 315 objects , we find that the area flux ratio is slightly larger than 2 when we calculate it using our own noise estimates .",
    "thus , it is not clear why these objects were rejected by @xcite .",
    "it is possible that there is difference in noise calculation and in modeling continuum between these two studies .    in summary ,",
    "although the selection method of @xcite provides consistent and quantitative criteria for identifying a hidden broad h@xmath0  component , it is somewhat limited due to the fact that the wing components in the narrow lines are not included in their fitting , and that their area ratio cut may reject a weak and shallow broad h@xmath0  component .",
    "more detailed studies on the detection scheme of a weak h@xmath0  component is necessary to better detect hidden type 1 agns .",
    "by detecting a broad component in the h@xmath0  line profile , we conservatively identified a sample of 611 type 1 agns at 0.02 @xmath2 z @xmath2 0.1 , using the catalogue of @xcite , which provides a large sample of type 2 agns classified based on the emission line flux ratios .",
    "we increased the sample size of the hidden type 1 agns from 142 @xcite to 611 by extending the redshift range out to z=0.1 and using a consistent and improved emission line analysis .",
    "the main findings are summarized as follows .",
    "@xmath75 the hidden type 1 agns have a similar range of the h@xmath0  width , but on average lower luminosity compared to typical type 1 agns at the same redshift range , indicating that these hidden type 1 agns with a relatively weak agn continuum is useful to study the properties of low luminosity agns and their host galaxies .",
    "the mean black hole mass estimated based on the h@xmath0  fwhm and luminosity is log m@xmath11 = 7.20@xmath50.42 , while the mean eddington ratio is log l@xmath76/l@xmath8 = -2.04@xmath50.34 .",
    "@xmath75 these agns seem to slightly offset from the m@xmath11-@xmath12  relation defined by inactive galaxies and reverberation - mapped agns @xcite , presumably due to the systematic difference in estimating black hole mass ( i.e. , depending on h@xmath10  or h@xmath0 ) and potentially different virial factors between typical type 1 agns and the hidden type 1 agns with a weak agn continuum .",
    "in contrast , when we perform a joint - fit analysis by combining quiescent galaxies , rm agns , and hidden type 1 agns , we find no significant difference between typical type 1 agns and hidden type 1 agns .",
    "@xmath75 by investigating the kinematics of ionized gas , we find that the velocity dispersion of [ ] and the core component of [ ] is roughly consistent with stellar velocity dispersion , indicating that the host galaxy gravitational potential is responsible for the broadening of these lines .",
    "in contrast , the wing component of [ ] represents non - gravitational kinematics , i.e. , outflows , which are consistent with the finding of type 2 agns @xcite .    @xmath75 the velocity dispersion and velocity shift of [ ] show strong non - gravitational kinematics , i.e. , outflows .",
    "the fraction of agns with a wing component in [ ] strongly increases with agn luminosity , suggesting that the non - gravitational kinematics are directly connected to agn activity .",
    "@xmath75 the line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersion of the ionized gas in type 1 agns is on average larger than that of type 2 agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is consistent with the biconical outflow models and orientation effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the uncertainty of the velocity shift of [ ] is large , we find that there are more agns with blueshifted [ ] than agns with redshifted [ ] .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that the hidden type 1 agns follow the general characteristics of typical broad line agns except for low luminosity and low eddington ratio .",
    "more detailed studies on the detection scheme and the completeness of the broad line agns may provide a better understanding of these hidden type 1 agns , which can be used as a unique channel for studying agn unification and black hole - galaxy connection .",
