    "one of the poorly understood effects in low - energy phenomenology is the so - called @xmath0 rule .",
    "namely , kaon decays proceed at much higher rate through the @xmath0 channel than through the @xmath3 one .",
    "in particular , for decays to two pions the following relationship between the amplitudes is experimentally observed : @xmath4    in the standard model , the electro - weak interactions and the short - distance part of strong interactions are not enough to explain this predominance of @xmath0 transitions .",
    "the bulk of the ratio in eq .",
    "[ 22 ] is attributed to the long - distance part of strong interactions .",
    "the long - distance effects are contained in the matrix elements ( mes ) of the basis operators of the weak effective theory between hadron states .",
    "these mes have remained mostly unknown due to their non - perturbative character .",
    "we compute them on the lattice with statistics more than sufficient to distinguish signal from noise for the @xmath0 amplitude , thus allowing to check the prediction of the standard model and qcd against the experiment .    in a related effort",
    ", we address the direct cp - violating parameter @xmath1 , defined in @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are cp - even ( odd ) strong interaction eigenstates .",
    "our goal is to predict the value of @xmath1 in the standard model in order to see if it is different from the superweak theory and to compare it with experiment . as for the experimental situation",
    ", fermilab s ktev group has recently announced their latest result of which is consistent with the old result from cern s na48 experiment @xmath8 ) , although hardly consistent with the fermilab s previous result of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath2 value will be even more refined soon by including more data from fermilab and by complementing it with results from two other high - precision experiments at cern and @xmath10 factory at frascati .",
    "the theory is lagging behind these experiments , mostly due to the lack of knowledge of mes containing long - distance dynamics .",
    "we work within the effective theory obtained from the standard model by integrating out the @xmath11 boson and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks  @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is written in terms of linear combination of basis four - fermion operators : @xmath15 o_i ( \\mu )    \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are wilson coefficients ( currently known at two - loop order ) and @xmath18 . in this work",
    "we seek to compute mes @xmath19 , which are necessary for estimation of both @xmath20 and @xmath21 amplitudes and @xmath1 .",
    ".[tab : param]lattice parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for technical reasons , two - hadron states are very difficult to put on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath22 and @xmath23 and use chiral perturbation theory to recover @xmath19 as follows  @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 with staggered fermions , there is only one ( lower - dimensional ) operator that needs to be subtracted non - perturbatively in the manner shown above , namely @xmath26    it should be kept in mind that this procedure is based on the lowest - order relationships in the chiral perturbation theory , and thus may be significantly biased . in particular , it ignores the final state interactions between pions among other higher - order corrections .",
    "-.2 cm    in table  [ tab : param ] we show the simulation parameters .",
    "we are using a quenched @xmath27 ensemble , and compare it with a quenched @xmath28 ensemble to study cutoff dependence , with a @xmath29 ensemble with two dynamical quark flavors ( with comparable cutoff size ) to check the magnitude of quenching effects , and with another quenched @xmath27 ensemble to check the finite volume dependence .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ] are the diagrams we are computing .",
    "the `` eight '' diagrams , along with the two - point function and `` subtraction '' diagrams , are relatively cheap to compute .",
    "in contrast , the `` eye '' and `` annihilation '' diagrams have been known in the past to be noisy and therefore difficult to analyze . in the present study",
    "we have gained enough statistics to compute them with reliable accuracy .",
    "we use staggered fermions and gauge - invariant , tadpole - improved operators throughout the simulation .",
    "the masses of all light quarks are equal .",
    "other details and exact expressions for various quantities can be found in our upcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "the main results of this work are shown in fig .",

    "the dependence of isospin amplitude ratio on the kaon mass is quite dramatic .",
    "this is due to the behaviour of re@xmath21 amplitude , shown in fig .",
    "[ a2 ] ( for dynamical ensemble ) .",
    "the re@xmath20 amplitude is rather weakly dependent on the kaon mass ( fig .",
    "dependence of re@xmath20 amplitude on the cutoff size is shown in fig .",
    "[ cutoff ] . the finite volume dependence and the effect of quenching",
    "are found small compared to noise .    in order to compare the theoretical prediction for the amplitude ratio with experiment , it is necessary to specify a mass point for extrapolation in fig .",
    "[ omega ] .",
    "if higher - order chiral relationships were used to obtain these amplitudes , they would provide a natural mass point . at this stage ,",
    "all we can do is suggest that the mass point is somewhere between kaon and pion mass .",
    "this would give us a result approximately consistent with experiment , especially for the dynamical ensemble .",
    "independent of the exact mass point , a significant enhancement of @xmath0 over @xmath3 transition is evident .    -.2",
    "cm    -.2 cm    -.2 cm    -.2 cm",
    "in addition to the difficulties mentioned above , estimation of @xmath1 is further complicated by the issue of matching lattice and continuum operators .",
    "usually such matching is done using lattice perturbation theory .",
    "for some operators important for @xmath1 , the perturbation theory is unreliable .",
    "this is a serious obstacle for estimating @xmath1 , especially considering that it is an extremely fragile quantity , dependent on several subtle cancellations .",
    "what is needed is a non - perturbative matching procedure , similar to the one described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a temporary step ,",
    "we have adopted a partially non - perturbative matching procedure , based on computing bilinear renormalization constants  @xcite .",
    "we can obtain only an approximate guide to the size of four - fermion operator matching coefficients , since a few _ ad hoc _ assumptions are made .",
    "if this procedure is true , we get a surprising result : @xmath30 .",
    "this result and the validity of our assumptions should be verified by full non - perturbative operator matching .",
    "we have computed mes of all basis operators appropriate for predicting the magnitude of @xmath0 amplitude enhancement and @xmath2 , on a number of gauge ensembles with reasonable statistical accuracy .",
    "a few systematic uncertainties still preclude a definite result for either of the two quantities . for @xmath0 rule , the main uncertainty is due to unknown higher - order chiral corrections , while for @xmath2 there is an additional uncertainty due to the difficulties with operator matching .",
    "we observe that within this sizeable uncertainty , the prediction for re@xmath31 ratio is of the same order as the experiment .",
