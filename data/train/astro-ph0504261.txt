    "a very common tool in studying x - ray sources is spectral fitting , e.g. , with models included in the xspec packet ( arnaud 1996 ) . in this way",
    ", a spectrum averaged over some period can be decomposed into components due to various radiative processes . however , spectral fitting is not unique in general , and the same data",
    "can often be well fitted with more than one spectral model .",
    "another way of studying x - ray sources is via their power spectra .",
    "however , power spectra are usually integrated over a large range of photon energies , which makes it difficult to make inferences regarding the underlying radiative processes .",
    "also , progress towards physical understanding of power spectra of , e.g. , x - ray binaries , has been rather modest .",
    "the best present physical description of their power spectra appears to be in terms of lorentzians ( e.g. , nowak 2000 ; belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ) , fourier transforms of damped harmonic oscillators .",
    "however , this decomposition is rather orthogonal to the decomposition of energy spectra into components due to different radiative processes .",
    "yet another observable is the energy - dependent variance , @xmath0 , or the rms fractional variability , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the photon energy and @xmath3 is the time - averaged flux as a function of @xmath2 . for a given time bin of the underlying lightcurve and the length of the observation",
    ", the variance is an integral of the power spectrum over the frequency range spanning those two time intervals .",
    "alternatively , one can compute the variance corresponding to a narrower range of time scales ( frequencies ) or to a component in a fit to a power spectrum , e.g. , the variance corresponding to a qpo . given @xmath4 and @xmath3",
    ", we can compute the spectrum of the corresponding variable component , @xmath5 if @xmath4 is calculated for a range of fourier frequency , @xmath6 represents a frequency - resolved spectrum ( revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov 1999 ) .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath6 may not always be interpreted as a spectrum from a physical process ( e.g. , for the case of spectral pivoting , see below ) , while @xmath4 can always be interpreted physically .",
    "spectra of rms of astrophysical x - ray sources have often been computed ( e.g. , mndez et al .  1997 ;",
    "lin et al .  2000 ; edelson et al .  2002 ; wardziski et al .  2002 ; zdziarski et al .  2002a , b , 2004 , 2005 ; vaughan et al .  2003 ; gilfanov , revnivtsev & molkov 2003 ; frontera et al",

    "; rodriguez et al .  2004 ) .",
    "however , interpretation or theoretical models of observed rms spectra have so far been relatively rare .",
    "e.g. , mndez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gilfanov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have fitted @xmath6 of x - ray binaries by blackbody and wien spectra , respectively .",
    "then , vaughan & fabian ( 2004 ) , fabian et al .  ( 2004 ) and zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have modelled observed rms spectra due to superposition of different spectral component , each characterized by a different variance ( see section [ comp ] ) .",
    "gallo et al .  (",
    "2004 ) have shown that the rms spectrum of the seyfert 1h 0707495 is well reproduced by the ratio of the spectra of its high and low flux levels multiplied by a constant .",
    "this result can be simply explained as that ratio being proportional to the range of fluxes at which the source varies at a given energy , which should indeed be proportional to its rms .    as found by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , the dominant cause of the variability in the hard state of cyg x-1 , and probably some other black hole binaries , on certain time scales is the varying flux in the soft seed photons irradiating the comptonizing plasma and much less varying the power supplied to the hot plasma .",
    "this results in a spectral pivoting with the pivot point in the middle of the spectrum , and the rms below the pivot decreasing with energy .",
    "such rms spectra decreasing with energy in the x - ray range in the hard state have been found , e.g. , by wardziski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and frontera et al .",
    "then , zdziarski et al .  ( 2003 ) presented a formalism to calculate the rms of a pivoting spectrum under various assumptions regarding the distribution of the spectral indices and the possible spread of the pivot energy .",
    "those authors also show this gives a very good description of the long - term rms of cyg x-1 in the hard state .",
    "an opposite variability pattern has been found in the soft state of cyg x-1 .",
    "churazov , gilfanov & revnivtsev ( 2001 ) have found the variability pattern in the _",
    "rxte_/pca data consists of a constant disc blackbody emission and a variable high - energy tail .",
    "zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2002b ) have found a very similar pattern in the _ cgro_/batse and _ rxte_/asm data , and have interpreted it as resulting from a hot plasma with a variable power supply irradiated by an approximately constant flux of soft photons .",
    "consistent with this picture , they found the rms spectrum of those data increasing with energy in the x - ray range and saturating at an approximately constant level around @xmath7100 kev .",
    "another considered cause of energy - dependent rms is time evolution of flares .",
    "ycki ( 2004 ) have calculated the rms spectrum using the flare model of poutanen & fabian ( 1999 ) and showed it results in the rms increasing with energy .    here",
    ", we further consider the potential of rms spectra for physical interpretation of x - ray emission of cosmic sources and identifying the underlying radiative processes .",
    "we develop a formalism for calculating rms spectra from an accretion flow in which the local level of variability is a function of radius , as , e.g. , in the propagation models of lyubarskii ( 1997 ) , kotov , churazov & gilfanov ( 2001 ) , ycki ( 2003 ) . in the presented method",
    ", we assume that the shape of emission from a given radius is constant , and thus the changes of the rms with energy are due to superposition of emission from different radii .",
    "we apply this formalism to the cases of blackbody and e - folded power - law local spectra .",
    "we compare the model rms spectra to one observed from the black - hole binary grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "let us consider emission spectrum averaged over a certain period of time consisting of a number of components , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the averege flux in the @xmath10-th spectral component .",
    "the variability of each component is given by its standard deviation , @xmath11 .",
    "for notational simplicity , we omit hereafter the average sign for @xmath12 and the energy subscript for @xmath13 and @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .    the total variance , @xmath16 , has then contributions from all of the components , @xmath17 where the covariance is @xmath18 in the case of complete coherence ( same phases ) , and @xmath19 for the complete incoherence .",
    "hereafter , we consider only these two limiting cases , in which @xmath20 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath21 .",
    "the relative level of variability in each component is @xmath22 .",
    "then , the total rms is @xmath23 in the fully coherent and incoherent case , respectively .",
    "note that even when the variability of various components is coherent and each @xmath24 is independent of energy ( but different for different component ) , the total @xmath25 will change with energy due to varying relative contributions of spectral components .",
    "we then consider an accretion disc , with the flux per unit area , @xmath26 , and the fractional variability , @xmath27 , being functions of the radius from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "the flux from the disc per unit angle and energy is @xmath30 if the variability is coherent over that range of @xmath31 , @xmath32    if the variability is completely incoherent over infinitesimally small ranges of the radius , @xmath33 becomes also infinitesimally small due to the effect of averaging over a very large number of small contributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the variance will be finite when the variability is coherent within some finite regions varying approximately independently of each other .",
    "for example , the variability can be coherent within a given coherence length , @xmath34 .",

    "note that although equation ( [ int_sum_lin ] ) is formally more accurate than the sum of equation ( [ sum_lin ] ) , it may not be more accurate in reality given the approximate character of the assumption of the sharp boundaries of the independent subregions with constant rms each .",

    "equation ( [ flux_lin ] ) is now replaced by @xmath45 for comparison , we also calculate the coherent variability using the same approximations as for equations ( [ sum_log ] ) and ( [ flux_log ] ) , which yields @xmath46",
    "now we consider some examples of the radiated spectra and the radial dependencies of both the spectra and the local rms , @xmath27 . for an emitted spectrum ,",
    "we assume its local power is equal to the local dissipation rate , i.e. , neglect advection .",

    "the first dependence corresponds to a newtonian disc torqued at the inner boundary ( as assumed , in particular , in the commonly - used disc blackbody model , diskbb in xspec , mitsuda et al .",
    "it corresponds , e.g. , to either @xmath49 the minimum stable orbit ( which is between @xmath50 and @xmath51 from nonrotating to the maximally rotating black hole ) or the magnetic stresses important near the minumum stable orbit ( e.g. , merloni & fabian 2003 and references therein ) .",

    "we also consider the wien limit of the blackbody spectrum , see appendix a.    then we consider a power law with an exponential cutoff , which roughly approximates emission due to unsaturated comptonization from a hot plasma . as in the blackbody case , we normalize the spectrum to the local dissipation rate , @xmath61 } , \\quad e\\geq e_0 , \\label{fpl}\\ ] ] and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the incomplete gamma function [ @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath67 is the local photon index , @xmath68 is the e - folding energy , the dimensional constant , @xmath57 , depends on the central mass and the accretion rate , and @xmath69 is the minimum energy in the spectrum , roughly corresponding to the average energy of the seed photons undergoing comptonization .    we then consider a model with a hot inner flow surrounded by a cold disc , providing the seed photons ( e.g. , zdziarski et al .",
    "then the flux in the seed photons decreases with the decreasing radius and the locally - emitted spectrum hardens .",
    "this is confirmed by fourier - resolved spectroscopy , showing , e.g. , the spectrum of cyg x-1 in the hard state hardens with the increasing fourier frequency ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "since the fourier - resolved spectrum has the slope depending on the logarithm of the fourier frequency , we assume here @xmath67 to be linear in the logarithm of radius , @xmath70 where the spectral index changes from @xmath71 at the outer radius of the hot flow to @xmath72 at the inner radius .",
    "note that the rms(@xmath2 ) dependence for the case of constant @xmath73 would be constant as well .",
    "we then need to specify the fractional variability as a function of the radius . if we consider a perturbation with a given frequency , @xmath74 , propagating with a constant speed , @xmath75 , towards a sink at the center ( or from a central source outside ) , the wave amplitude will increase with decreasing radius as ( see vaughan & nowak 1997 ; nowak et al .",

    "this increase becomes smaller when the wavelength becomes comparable with the radius , see fig .",
    "[ hankel_plot ] .",
    "we note that the sound speed in actual accretion discs generally increases with decreasing @xmath31 , which would flatten the dependence of equation ( [ hankel ] ) .",
    "a wave travelling through a geometrically - thin disc has @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the gas - pressure and radiation - pressure dominated cases , respectively ( e.g. , svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) .",
    "this would lead to @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "the dependence for the gas - pressure dominated case is modified close to the inner radius for the case of the zero - torque boundary , leading to @xmath99 at @xmath100 , which would strongly amplify the wave .",
    "furthermore , wave reflection from the inner boundary is neglected in the dependence of equation ( [ hankel ] ) .",
    "a treatment of those effects is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the rms radial profile given by equation ( [ hankel ] ) has been obtained for a single frequency .",
    "thus , that rms profile may apply for qpos .",
    "however , the total rms dependence in some states follows that of the low - frequency qpo ( zdziarski et al .",
    "2005 ) , and equation ( [ hankel ] ) is likely to be applicable more generally .",
    "we also note that perturbations propagating via waves will maintain coherence between emission at different radii ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) , and thus this radial rms profile applies to the coherent variability only .    on the other hand",
    ", the local fractional variability may be due to superposition of fluctuations ( correlated or not ) occuring at a number of radii ( lyubarskii 1997 ) . in that case",
    ", it will be likely of a power - law form .",

    "in the case of blackbody and wien ( see appendix a ) spectra with the torqued dissipation profile , equation ( [ d_no_b ] ) , and @xmath106 we can obtain a number of analytical solutions for the coherent @xmath13 , equation ( [ coh ] ) .",
    "first , @xmath107 in the case of blackbody emission and @xmath108 . here",
    "for blackbody emission at a general value of @xmath102 , we find the limiting forms , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the riemann zeta function and @xmath64 is the gamma function .",
    "note the power law index of 5/3 at low energies appears independently of the value of @xmath102 as long at it is @xmath112 , whereas it is @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",

    "[ rms_813 ] shows the 318 kev rms , obtained directly from the lightcurve with 1/128 s time bins .",
    "we have performed an extensive search of theoretical models fitting the data .",
    "we have found , in particular , that we can rule out models with the rms profile corresponding to the amplitude of a disc wave , equation ( [ hankel ] ) .",
    "the reason for it is its rms(@xmath2 ) dependence being much too flat ( fig .",
    "[ rms_hankel ] ) than the observed dependence .",
    "the data require , in fact , an rms profile much steeper than @xmath104 of the wave profile . our best model , shown in fig .",
    "[ rms_813 ] , has @xmath150 , incoherent variability with @xmath130 and the dissipation and rms profiles of equations ( [ d_b ] ) and ( [ r_d ] ) , respectively .",
    "the flattening seen at low energies then requires an addition ( in quadrature ) of a variability pattern with the rms independent of energy ( corresponding to a varying normalization of the entire spectrum ) at the amplitude of @xmath154 .",
    "we stress we have approximated here the photon spectrum as a disc blackbody , which only roughly approximates the actual spectrum . taking into account",
    "this inaccuracy will modify somewhat the model rms dependencies .",
    "therefore , we we have not systematically fitted the rms data , e.g. , by the least - square method , as the resulting small fit improvements may be less significant than the inaccuracies introduced by our assumption above .",
    "we have presented a formalism to calculate rms spectra from accretion flows under the assumptions that each radius is characterized by a given value of the local rms and a given spectral form ( section [ disc ] ) .",
    "we do not constrain a priori the profiles of the local rms , but it is likely that the flow becomes more turbulent and unstable with decreasing radius , which results in the rms increasing with decreasing @xmath31 ( at least down to some radius ) . in section [ radial ] , we consider three specific radial emissivity profiles . in the case of a local blackbody or wien spectra ,",
    "the peak energy increases ( at least for most radii ) with the decreasing radius , which leads to rms spectra increasing with energy , see section [ blackbody ] .",
    "this is indeed observed in an example of a blackbody - like emission we consider ( section [ grs ] ) . for the case of local wien emission ,",
    "we obtain analytical formulae for the integrated disc spectrum , which we find to be a good approximation to the disc blackbody spectrum ( appendix a ) , and the rms , section [ analytical ] . for both blackbody and wien spectra",
    ", we obtain formulae connecting the power - law index , @xmath102 , of the radial rms profile with the low - energy index of the energy rms dependence , equal to either @xmath113 or 5/3 ( section [ analytical ] ) .",
    "thus , measurements of the indices of rms energy dependence can constrain the variability properties of the emitting accretion disc .",
    "we have also considered the local emission due to thermal comptonization ( section [ radial ] ) .",
    "if the seed photons are emitted by an outside cold disk ( as is likely to be the case of the hard state of black - hole binaries ) , the power - law part of the local comptonization spectrum will harden with the decreasing radius .",
    "such a behaviour is indeed observed in some sources ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "again , integration over radii yields rms spectra increasing with energy ( section [ pl ] ) , though with an overall dependence much flatter than in the blackbody case .",
    "such a behaviour is also obtained in models considering in more detail propagation of disturbances towards the central black hole ( ycki 2003 ; p. t. ycki , personal communication ) .    on the other hand , some black - hole binaries in the hard state show x - ray rms spectra decreasing with energy ( e.g. , wardziski et al .",
    "this is likely to be caused by varying shape of the spectrum emitted at a given radius ( section [ intro ] ) , which effect is not included in the formalism presented here .",
    "we have also not considered variability related to the orbital motion at a given radius .",
    "this effect may be important observationally in agns ( turner et al .",
    "2004 ) , where the orbital motion can be well resolved by x - ray observations .    given the theoretical uncertainty about the level of turbulence in accretion discs as a function of radius and the degree of correlation between emission from different radii , our models rely on a number of assumptions and free parameters , e.g. , about the radial profile of the rms , see section [ examples ] .",
    "still , data of sufficient quality can strongly constrain the models .",
    "for example , blackbody rms energy dependence flattens at a much lower energy in the coherent case than in the incoherent one ( section [ blackbody ] ) .",
    "we stress that rms studies can , and should , be combined with other observational constraints .",
    "the components present in time - averaged energy spectra can be determined by spectral fits .",
    "furthermore , the degree of coherence between emission at different energy bands ( and , presumably , different radii ) , can be found by cross - correlation of the corresponding lightcurves .",
    "a more detailed diagnostic is the coherence function ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) , the cross - correlation coefficient as a function of fourier frequency .",
    "also , coherence between spectral components can be tested directly from the rms energy dependence , as the rms@xmath155 from coherently varying components would be simply the weighted average of the rms of the components ( section [ comp ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", two components varying independently would give a dip in the rms@xmath155 at the energy where their spectra intersect , due to the partial cancellation of their independent variability .",
    "such dips appear , e.g. , to be absent in the @xmath156 states of grs 1915 + 105 ( zdziarski et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in future work , the various approaches to calculating observed rms spectra can be combined .",
    "e.g. , more than one component with radial dependencies of rms ( section [ comp ] ) can be considered ( zdziarski et al .",
    "2005 ) , or the radial dependence can be combined with time evolution at a given radius .",
    "then , the rms from time evolution of a uniform comptonization source due to variability of the plasma parameters is considered by gierliski & zdziarski ( in preparation ) .",
