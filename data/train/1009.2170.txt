    "the low - energy sector of qcd has been successfully described over recent years within the chiral lagrangian framework .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is based on the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry @xmath3 with @xmath4 light flavours and provides a consistent and systematic model - independent scheme to calculate low - energy observables @xcite .",
    "the effective chpt lagrangian is constructed as the more general expansion @xmath5 compatible with the qcd underlying symmetries , where @xmath6 denotes derivatives or meson mass and external momentum below the chiral scale @xmath7 1 gev .",
    "the @xmath8 group of vector transformations corresponds to the isospin symmetry for @xmath9 . in the @xmath10 case ,",
    "the vector group symmetry is broken by the strange - light quark mass difference @xmath11 , although @xmath12 can still be considered as a perturbation compared to @xmath13 , leading to @xmath1 chpt @xcite . in the @xmath9 case ,",
    "the isospin symmetric limit is a very good approximation in nature .",
    "however , there are several known examples where isospin breaking is phenomenologically relevant at low energies , such as sum rules for quark condensates @xcite , meson masses and corrections to dashen s theorem @xcite , pion - pion @xcite and pion - kaon @xcite scattering in connection with mesonic atoms @xcite , cp violation @xcite , @xmath14 mixing @xcite , kaon decays @xcite and other hadronic observables ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the two possible sources of isospin breaking are the @xmath15 light quark mass difference and electromagnetic ( em ) interactions",
    ". both can be accommodated within the chpt framework .",
    "the former is accounted for by modifying the quark mass matrix and generates a @xmath16 mixing term in the @xmath1 lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the expected corrections from this source are of order @xmath17 . on the other hand , em interactions , which in particular induce mass differences between charged and neutral light mesons ,",
    "can be included in chpt via the external source method and give rise to new terms in the effective lagrangian @xcite of order @xmath18 , @xmath19 and so on , with @xmath20 the electric charge .",
    "these terms fit into the chpt power counting scheme by considering formally @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the pion decay constant in the chiral limit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the isospin - breaking corrections to quark condensates , whose main importance is their relation to the symmetry properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the singlet contributions @xmath23 for @xmath0 and @xmath24 for @xmath1 are order parameters for chiral symmetry , while the isovector one @xmath25 behaves as an order parameter for isospin breaking , which is not spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "we will calculate the condensates within one - loop chpt , which ensures the model independency of our results , and will address several phenomenological consequences .",
    "the two sources of isospin - breaking will be treated consistently on the same footing , which will allow us to test the sensibility of previous phenomenological analysis to the em low - energy constants ( lec ) .",
    "moreover , the em corrections induce an explicit breaking of chiral symmetry which will lead to lower bounds for certain combinations of the lec involved , provided the vacuum response is ferromagnetic , as in the case of quark masses .",
    "in addition , in @xmath1 one can derive a sum rule relating the different condensate ratios for @xmath26 @xcite which , as we will show here , receives an em correction not considered before and of the same order as that proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the latter is useful to estimate the vacuum asymmetry @xmath28 reliably within chpt .",
    "an additional aspect that we will discuss is the matching of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lec combinations appearing in the condensates when both isospin - breaking sources are present , comparing with previous results in the literature .",
    "the analysis carried out in the present work will serve also to establish a firm phenomenological basis for its extension to finite temperature , in order to study different aspects related to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .    with the above motivations in mind ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : form ] we briefly review the effective lagrangian formalism needed for our present work , paying special attention to several theoretical issues and to the numerical values of the parameters and lec needed here . quark condensates for @xmath0 are calculated and analyzed in section [ sec : condsu2 ] , where we discuss the general aspects of the bounds for the em lec based on chiral symmetry breaking . in that section",
    "we also comment on the analogy with lattice analysis .",
    "the @xmath1 case is separately studied in section [ sec : condsu3 ] . in that section , we perform first a numerical analysis of the isospin - breaking corrections , paying special attention to the effect of the em lec in connection with previous results in the literature . in addition , we obtain the em corrections to the sum rule for condensate ratios , which we use to estimate the vacuum asymmetry within chpt .",
    "we also provide the lec bounds for this case , checking them with previous lec estimates and , finally , we discuss the matching conditions for the lec involved . in appendix",
    "[ app : lag ] we collect the lagrangians of fourth order and the renormalization of the lec used in the main text .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian up to fourth order is given schematically by    @xmath29    the second order lagrangian is the familiar non - linear sigma model , including now the gauge coupling of mesons to the em field through the covariant derivative , plus an extra term :    @xmath30 \\\\ & \\quad + c{\\mbox{tr}}\\left[ququ^\\dagger\\right ] .",

    "however , it would be isospin invariant if the quark matrix @xmath39 is treated as an external field transforming as @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the low - energy effective lagrangian has to include all possible terms compatible with this new symmetry , in addition to the standard qcd symmetries .",
    "the lowest order @xmath49 is the @xmath43-term in ( [ l2 ] ) , since @xmath50 transforms as @xmath51 .",

    "working out the kinetic terms , they can be directly related to the leading - order tree level values for the decay constants and masses of the gb . in @xmath0 ,",
    "the tree level masses to leading order are : @xmath57 with @xmath58 the average light quark mass .",
    "note that both terms contributing to the charged pion mass are of the same order in the chiral power counting , although numerically @xmath59 , which we will use in practice as a further perturbative parameter to simplify some of the results .    in the @xmath1 case , the mass term in ( [ l2 ] ) induces a mixing contribution between the @xmath60 and the @xmath34 meson fields given by @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the kinetic term has to be brought to the canonical form before identifying the gb masses , which is performed by the field rotation @xcite :    @xmath62    where the mixing angle is given by :    @xmath63    once the above @xmath16 rotation is carried out , the @xmath1 tree level meson masses to leading order read : @xmath64,\\nonumber\\\\ m_{k^+}^2&=&m_{k-}^2=(m_s+m_u ) b_0 + 2 c \\frac{e^2}{f^2},\\nonumber\\\\ m_{k^0}^2&=&(m_s+m_d ) b_0,\\nonumber\\\\ m_\\eta^2&=&2b_0\\left[\\frac{1}{3}(\\hat m + 2m_s)+\\frac{2}{3}(m_s-\\hat m)\\frac{\\sin^2\\varepsilon}{\\cos 2\\varepsilon}\\right ] .",

    "the additional equation provides the following relation between the tree level lo masses :    @xmath67    the above equation is compatible with the one obtained in @xcite neglecting @xmath68 terms .",
    "actually , note that although all terms in ( [ treemassessu3 ] ) are formally of the same chiral order , numerically ( see below ) we expect @xmath69 and hence the mixing - angle corrections to the squared masses to be @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the neutral pion and eta respectively . on the other hand , in the isospin - symmetric limit ( @xmath44 and @xmath72 ) ( [ gmoext ] ) is nothing but the gell - mann - okubo formula @xmath73 @xcite . neglecting only the @xmath15 mass difference in ( [ treemassessu3 ] )",
    "leads to dashen s theorem @xmath74 @xcite and then eq.([gmoext ] ) reduces to @xmath75 , i.e. , the gell - mann - okubo formula for neutral states .",
    "however , the violation of dashen s theorem at tree level due to those quark mass differences is significant numerically for kaons . in our present treatment",
    "we consider those differences on the same footing as the em corrections to the masses . for pions ,",
    "the main effect in the @xmath76 mass difference comes from the em contribution @xcite .",
    "all the previous expressions hold for tree level lo masses @xmath77 with @xmath78 , in terms of which we will write all of our results .",
    "they coincide with the physical masses to leading order in chpt , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "calculating the chpt corrections to a given order allows then to determine the numerical values of the tree level masses , knowing their physical values and to that order of approximation .",
    "the same holds for @xmath22 , which coincides with the meson decay constants in the chiral limit @xmath80 .",
    "next to leading order @xmath81 corrections to meson masses and decay constants were given in @xcite for @xmath82 .",
    "em corrections to the masses can be found in @xcite for @xmath1 and in @xcite for @xmath0 including both @xmath83 and @xmath2 isospin - breaking terms .",
    "the fourth - order lagrangian in ( [ efflag ] ) consists of all possible terms compatible with the qcd symmetries to that order , including the em ones .",
    "the @xmath84 lagrangian is given in @xcite for the @xmath0 case , @xmath85 ( contact terms ) and @xmath86 denoting the dimensionless lec multiplying each independent term , and in @xcite for @xmath1 the lec named @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the em @xmath19 and @xmath89 for @xmath0 are given in @xcite , @xmath90 denoting the corresponding em lec , and in @xcite for @xmath1 with the @xmath91 em lec .",
    "for completeness , we give in appendix [ app : lag ] the relevant terms needed in this work .",
    "the lec are renormalized in such a way that they absorb all the one - loop ultraviolet divergences coming from @xmath92 and @xmath18 , according to the chpt counting , and depend on the @xmath93 low - energy renormalization scale @xmath94 in such a way that the physical quantities are finite and scale - independent .",
    "the renormalization conditions for all the lec can be found in @xcite and we collect in appendix [ app : lag ] only those needed in the present work .    as customary",
    ", we denote the scale - dependent and renormalized lec by an  @xmath95 \" superscript .",
    "the renormalized lec are independent of the quark masses by definition , although their finite parts are unknown , i.e. , they are not provided within the low - energy theory .",
    "the numerical values of the lec at a given scale can be estimated by fitting meson experimental data , theoretically by matching the underlying theory under some approximations , or from the lattice .",
    "these procedures allow to obtain estimates for the  real - world \" lec at the expense of introducing residual dependencies of those lec on the parameters of the approximation procedure , which typically involves a truncation of some kind .",
    "examples of these are the @xmath12 dependence on the @xmath0 lec when matching the @xmath1 ones , the correlations between lec , masses and decay constants through the fitting procedure , the qcd renormalization scale and gauge dependence of some of the em lec or the dependence with lattice artifacts such as finite size or spurious meson masses .",
    "we will give more details below , specially regarding the em lec which will play an important role in our present work .",
    "an exception to the lec estimates are the contact lec @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which are needed for renormalization but can not be directly measured .",
    "the physical quantities depending on them are therefore ambiguous , which comes from the definition of the condensates in qcd perturbation theory , requiring subtractions to converge @xcite .",
    "it is therefore phenomenologically convenient to define suitable combinations which are independent of the @xmath98 .",
    "we will bear this in mind throughout this work , providing such combinations when isospin - breaking is included .",
    "we will analyze in one - loop chpt ( next to leading order ) the quark condensates , which for a given flavour @xmath99 can be written at that order as :    @xmath100    the above equation is nothing but the functional derivative with respect to the @xmath101-th component of the scalar current , particularized to the values of the physical quark masses , according to the external source method @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will be interested only in the terms of the fourth - order lagrangian containing at least one power of the quark masses .",
    "these are the operators given in eqns.([lag4su2 ] ) and ( [ lag4su3 ] ) for @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "thus , the lec that enter in our calculation are @xmath102 in @xmath0 , and @xmath103 , @xmath104 in @xmath1 .",
    "besides , up to nlo , only tree level diagrams from the fourth - order lagrangian can contribute to the condensates , so that in practice it is enough to set @xmath105 in ( [ lag4su2])-([lag4su3 ] ) for getting those tree - level contributions from ( [ conddef ] ) .",
    "for most of the numerical values of the different low - energy constants and parameters in the @xmath1 case , we will follow @xcite , where fits to @xmath106 experimental data are performed in terms of @xmath107 chpt expressions , including the isospin mass difference @xmath108 and em corrections to the meson masses , extending a previous work @xcite where isospin breaking was not considered .",
    "those fits have been improved in a recent work @xcite , which takes into account new phenomenological and lattice results .",
    "we will however stick to the values of @xcite , since our main interest is to compare the isospin - breaking condensates with the two sources included and to estimate the effect of the em lec . in the new fits @xcite",
    "isospin breaking is included only to correct for the charged kaon mass and the condensate values are not provided . for a review of different estimates of the quark masses and condensates see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , in @xcite a recent update of lattice results for low - energy parameters can be found , including lec and the quark condensate .",
    "we will use the central values of the main fit in @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath109 @xcite is used as an input in @xcite , as well as @xmath110 , as follows e.g. from ozi rule or large-@xmath111 arguments @xcite .",
    "the more recent fits @xcite consider an updated value of @xmath112 in accordance with recent determinations @xcite and a nonzero value of @xmath113 is obtained as an output .",
    "the suppression of @xmath113 has been questioned in connection with a reduction of the light quark condensate when the number of flavours is increased @xcite , within the framework of generalized chpt . in that context , the chiral power counting is modified due to the smallness of the condensate . here , we will adhere to the standard chpt picture , where the condensate and the gor - like relations are dominated by the leading order @xcite , sustained by the recent lattice lec estimates @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath114 mev , @xmath115 gev@xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 mev@xmath119 are outputs from the main fit in @xcite . with those values we get from ( [ mixangle ] ) @xmath120 and from ( [ treemassessu3 ] ) the tree level masses of @xmath121 .    to calculate the tree level charged meson masses , we need also the value of the @xmath43 constant , which can be inferred also from the results in @xcite since the em correction is numerically very small in the charged kaon mass with respect to the pure qcd contribution .",
    "this allows to extract the tree level charged kaon mass directly from the expressions for @xmath122 in @xcite , approximating @xmath123 by the full physical mass .",
    "from there we extract the value of @xmath43 by subtracting the tree level qcd part in ( [ treemassessu3 ] ) calculated with the above given quark masses . in this way we get @xmath124 mev@xmath125 , which is very close to the values",
    "obtained simply from the charged - neutral pion mass difference in ( [ treemassessu3 ] ) setting the masses and @xmath22 to their physical values @xcite or from resonance saturation arguments @xcite . from that @xmath43 value",
    "we obtain the tree - level charged pion mass , using again ( [ treemassessu3 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , to the order we are calculating we could have used as well the physical meson masses and decay constants instead of the tree level ones , since formally the difference is hidden in higher orders .",
    "the main reason why we choose the values in @xcite is to compare directly with their numerical quark condensates and estimate the importance of the @xmath126 corrections ( see section [ sec : resultsu3 ] for details ) .",
    "the constant @xmath127 will also appear explicitly in quark condensates . since it can not be fixed with meson experimental data , when needed we will estimate it from scalar resonance saturation arguments as @xmath128 @xcite , although we will comment below more about the @xmath129 dependence of the results and provide physical quantities which are independent of the contact terms .    regarding the em lec , the @xmath1 @xmath126",
    "have been estimated in the literature under different theoretical schemes .",
    "resonance saturation was used in @xcite , large-@xmath111 and njl models in @xcite , complemented with qcd perturbative information in @xcite and a sum - rule approach combined with low - lying resonance saturation has been followed in @xcite .",
    "the works @xcite have in common the use of perturbative qcd methods for the short - distance part of the lec and different model approaches for the long - distance part .",
    "this procedure implies that the lec estimated in that way depend ( roughly logarithmically ) in general on the qcd renormalization scale , which we call @xmath130 to distinguish it from the low - energy scale @xmath94 , as well as on the gauge parameter .",
    "a closely related problem is that the separation of the strong ( @xmath72 ) and em contributions for a given physical quantity is in principle ambiguous @xcite .",
    "the origin of this ambiguity @xcite is that qcd scaling quantities such as quark masses contain also em contributions through the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution in the full qcd+em theory .",
    "thus , a particular prescription for disentangling those contributions must be provided .",
    "in addition , when matching such quantities between the low - energy sector and the underlying theory , the choice of a given prescription will necessarily affect the scale and gauge dependence of the em lec .",
    "these theoretical uncertainties , as well numerical ones , make those theoretical em lec estimates not fully compatible among them . for these reasons",
    ", in many works analyzing em corrections , the lec are simply assumed to lie within  natural \" values @xmath131 , @xmath132 @xmath133 at the scale @xmath134 @xcite",
    ". the above theoretical issues will be addressed in more detail in sections [ sec : condsu2 ] and [ sec : boundssu3 ] .",
    "the lec dependencies on the qcd scale and on the gauge parameter do no affect directly our results , being only relevant when comparing them with approaches where those lec are obtained by matching the underlying theory . in that context",
    "we will see that the lec combinations that we will deal with are gauge independent and lie within the stability range where the dependence on @xmath130 is smooth and the matching makes sense @xcite .",
    "the theoretical errors quoted e.g. in @xcite account for the uncertainty related to the @xmath130 dependence .    as for the @xmath0 @xmath135 ,",
    "no direct estimate is available to our knowledge , although one can relate them to the @xmath126 by performing formally a @xmath136 expansion in a given physical quantity calculated in @xmath1 and comparing to the corresponding @xmath0 expression , similarly as the @xmath137 conversion given in @xcite .",
    "this has been done partially for some combinations of the lec , namely , those appearing in the neutral pion mass @xcite , in pion scattering @xcite and in the pionium lifetime @xcite .",
    "more recently , a full matching of the em @xmath0 and @xmath1 lec at the lagrangian level has been performed in @xcite using functional integral methods in the chiral limit . in the present work",
    ", we will provide a complementary analysis .",
    "namely , in section [ sec : condsu3 ] we will obtain the matching relations between the lec involved in the quark condensates , including both @xmath27 and em contributions . those relations will be consistent with the results in @xcite and phenomenologically useful when dealing with approximate lec determinations where isospin and mass corrections may be entangled .",
    "we start by giving the explicit one - loop chpt expressions for the quark condensates in @xmath0 with all the isospin - breaking corrections included , which we derive from ( [ conddef ] ) :    @xmath138 , \\label{condsu2sum}\\\\   { \\langle \\bar u u - \\bar d d\\rangle}&=&4b_0 ^ 2(m_d - m_u)h_3-\\frac{8}{3}f^2b_0e^2k_7 + \\mathcal{o}\\left(p^2\\right ) , \\label{condsu2dif }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where :    @xmath139 ,     \\label{k2def}\\ ] ]    and throughout this work we will follow the same notation as in @xcite :    @xmath140 .",

    "the renormalization conditions for the lec involved in ( [ condsu2sum])-([condsu2dif ] ) can be found in @xcite and @xcite and we give them in appendix [ app : lag ] . with that lec renormalization",
    ", one can check that the condensates in ( [ condsu2sum])-([condsu2dif ] ) are finite and scale - independent , which is a nontrivial consistency check . recall that @xmath144 and @xmath145 do not need to be renormalized .",
    "the condensates still depend on the @xmath146 and @xmath144 contact lec , which , as explained above , yield an ambiguity in the determination of the condensates .",
    "the result ( [ condsu2sum ] ) for @xmath147 and @xmath2 reduces for @xmath72 to the expressions given in @xcite .",
    "the condensate difference ( [ condsu2dif ] ) is given in @xcite for @xmath72 , which we agree with , and in @xcite for @xmath147 , which we also agree with , except for the relative sign between the two terms , which should be a minus in their eq.(3.12 ) @xcite .",
    "let us now argue on how the em corrections to the condensates may lead to constraints for the em lec .",
    "those corrections come directly from the coupling of the em field to the quarks in the qcd action , which break chiral symmetry . actually , to understand better the origin of the different sources involved in chiral symmetry and isospin breaking , it is useful to keep the charges of the @xmath148 and @xmath149 flavours arbitrary and to separate the isoscalar and isovector contributions of the charge matrix in @xmath0 :    @xmath150    with @xmath151 corresponding to the third isospin component .",
    "the em part of the qcd lagrangian @xmath152 breaks explicitly chiral symmetry @xmath153 if @xmath154 , through the isovector part in ( [ chargesep ] ) .",
    "the isovector also breaks the isospin symmetry @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) except for transformations in the third direction , which corresponds to electric charge conservation . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass term @xmath157 breaks chiral symmetry for any nonzero value of the quark masses , preserving isospin symmetry if @xmath44 .",
    "altogether , the conclusion is that the qcd lagrangian is chiral invariant only if @xmath158 _ and _ @xmath159 .",
    "thus , chiral symmetry is explicitly broken even if @xmath158 , as long as any of the quark masses @xmath160 , or equivalently , in the presence of an external scalar source , as needed to derive the condensates . if @xmath158 and @xmath161 , chiral symmetry is broken but isospin symmetry is conserved .",
    "now , let us remind how this charge and mass symmetry breaking pattern translates into the low - energy sector .",
    "the leading order @xmath162 in ( [ l2 ] ) contains separate combinations of the charge and mass terms , both sharing the qcd pattern .",
    "thus , the charge contribution proportional to @xmath43 in ( [ l2 ] ) can be decomposed according to ( [ chargesep ] ) , giving a constant term proportional to @xmath163 independent of masses and fields , plus the term @xmath164{\\mbox{tr}}\\left[\\tau_3",
    "u \\tau_3 u^\\dagger\\right]$ ] , which contributes directly to the pion em mass difference in ( [ treemassessu2 ] ) . therefore , in the second order lagrangian all the em chiral symmetry breaking terms are proportional to @xmath165 .",
    "this is no longer true for the fourth order lagrangian in ( [ lag4su2 ] ) , for which the symmetries of the theory allow for crossed mass - charge terms , like those proportional to @xmath166 and @xmath145 .",
    "those crossed terms break chiral symmetry even for @xmath158 for any nonzero quark mass , the strength of chiral breaking being proportional both to the quark charge @xmath20 and to the quark mass @xmath167 .",
    "consequently , they contribute to @xmath168 , the expectation value of the @xmath155 singlet behaving as an order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking . setting @xmath105 in the lagrangian gives a piece proportional to @xmath169 yielding @xmath163 and @xmath165 contributions to @xmath170 and another one proportional to @xmath145 contributing both to @xmath170 and to @xmath171 , the isotriplet order parameter of isospin breaking :    @xmath172 ( m_u+m_d)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\left.2k_7\\left[(e_u+e_d)^2(m_u+m_d)+(e_u - e_d)(e_u+e_d)(m_u - m_d)\\right]\\right\\}+\\dots   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the dots indicate terms not contributing to the condensates at this order .    thus , we see how the two sources of isospin breaking show up in the order parameter ( [ condsu2dif ] ) , which does not receive pion loop contributions in @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is the explicit confirmation that isospin symmetry is not spontaneously broken in qcd @xcite , since all the contributions to this order parameter vanish for @xmath44 and @xmath72 .    on the other hand",
    ", the quark condensate @xmath170 behaves as an order parameter for chiral symmetry and therefore measures the different sources of symmetry breaking : spontaneous and explicit .",
    "thus , it is naturally expected that its absolute value increases when a new symmetry - breaking source , as the em contribution , is switched on .",
    "this increasing behaviour is what we denote as ferromagnetic , in analogy with the behaviour of the magnetization in a ferromagnetic material under an external magnetic field .",
    "there is no a priori formal argument to ensure the ferromagnetic - like nature of the qcd low - energy vacuum .",
    "we can nevertheless learn from the response of the system to the light quark mass @xmath167 , which is the actual counterpart of the magnetic field in a ferromagnet , since it breaks the chiral symmetry explicitly by coupling to the order parameter .",
    "for the mass , this ferromagnetic behaviour is actually followed by the @xmath72 condensates in the standard chpt framework , both to @xmath173 and to @xmath107 with the lec in @xcite , although assuming @xmath174 suppression and the dependence on contact terms still introducing a source of ambiguity . with the recent fit giving nonzero @xmath113 and a new value also for @xmath175",
    "@xcite we get also that @xmath176 increases with light quark masses , from our @xmath173 expressions .",

    "the em symmetry - breaking is of different nature as the mass , the former coming from vector - like interactions while the later being of scalar type .",
    "however , as we have discussed in the previous paragraphs , their symmetry breaking effects on certain observables are similar .",
    "thus , the isovector part in ( [ chargesep ] ) increases the masses of the charged mesons , according to ( [ treemassessu2 ] ) and ( [ treemassessu3 ] ) , while the isovector and isoscalar both mix with the mass and contribute to @xmath170 .",

    ", the em pure thermal corrections to the condensate also increase its absolute value for any temperature @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the condensate increases under the influence of an external magnetic field @xmath177 , which can be also understood as the reduction of the free energy @xmath178 ( to leading order ) needed to compensate for the em energy increasing @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "our purpose here will be to explore the consequences of that em ferromagnetic behaviour to leading order .",
    "if the vacuum response is ferromagnetic , certain bounds for the em lec involved should be satisfied .",
    "we will derive those bounds and show that they are independent of the low - energy scale and thus can be checked in terms of physical quantities .",
    "next we will check that the bounds are satisfied for the different estimates available for the em lec , with more detail for the @xmath1 case in section [ sec : boundssu3 ] , where we also discuss the gauge independence of our results .",
    "this will provide a consistency check for the ferromagnetic behaviour .",
    "an important comment is that we will discuss the ferromagnetic - like condition on the em correction to @xmath170 and , as explained above , the splitting of the @xmath72 and @xmath147 parts in qcd+em is ambiguous @xcite .",
    "this does not affect the low - energy representation of the condensates , which can be written in terms of physical quantities such as meson masses and decay constants .",
    "however , we will test our bounds with the em lec estimates obtained by matching low - energy results with the underlying theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to be consistent with the prescription for charge splitting followed in those works .",
    "this amounts to the direct separation of the @xmath72 part , which still may contain residual charge and @xmath130 qcd scale dependence through running parameters .",
    "the consequence is that the em lec thus defined are in general @xmath130-dependent , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , those estimates are reliable only if there is a stability range where the dependence on @xmath130 is smooth and lies within the theoretical errors @xcite .",
    "actually , such stability range criteria are met for the lec involved in our analysis ( see section [ sec : boundssu3 ] ) . within that range ,",
    "our identification of the @xmath180 dependent part in @xmath170 is consistent with the splitting scheme followed in those works .",
    "actually , in that scheme @xmath181 is @xmath130-independent and the @xmath180-dependent part of the @xmath130 running of @xmath182 is the same as that of @xmath183 in perturbative qcd+em @xcite .",
    "hence , it is consistent to assume that the chpt leading order of @xmath184 does not introduce any residual @xmath180 dependence when performing the charge splitting in the low - energy expression .",
    "using a different splitting prescription would lead in general to different bounds and a different definition of the em lec .",
    "for instance , an alternative splitting procedure is introduced in @xcite by matching running parameters of the @xmath180 theory with those of the @xmath82 one at a given matching scale @xmath185 . in that way ,",
    "the em part can be chosen as @xmath130 independent but it depends on the matching scale @xmath185 .",
    "we will not consider that splitting here , since there are no available theoretical estimates for the lec defined with that scheme .",
    "the scale dependence for the lec in either scheme is roughly expected to be logarithmic .",
    "having the above considerations in mind , and going back to the case of physical quark charges , we separate the em corrections to the condensate through the ratio :    @xmath186+e^2\\mathcal{k}_2^r(\\mu)+\\mathcal{o}\\left(p^4\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ = 1+e^2\\mathcal{k}_2^r(\\mu)-\\frac{4ce^2}{f^4}\\nu_{\\pi^0}+{{\\cal o}}(\\delta_\\pi^2)+{{\\cal o}}(p^4 ) , \\label{emratiosu2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath187 defined in ( [ munudef ] ) and where we have expanded in @xmath188 , as @xmath189 , which is numerically reliable and can be performed in addition to the chiral expansion , in order to simplify the previous expression .",
    "we note that in @xmath0 and to this order , the ratio ( [ emratiosu2 ] ) is not only finite and scale - independent but it is also independent of the not - em lec , including the contact @xmath190 , and therefore free of ambiguities related to the condensate definition . in fact , this ratio is also independent of @xmath191 , unlike the individual quark condensates , which have only physical meaning and give rise to observables when multiplied by the appropriate quark masses , since @xmath192 . in @xmath0 ,",
    "the above ratio does not depend either on the mass difference @xmath15 , i.e. , it depends only on the sum @xmath167 and its deviations from unity are therefore purely of em origin .",
    "all these properties make the ratio ( [ emratiosu2 ] ) a suitable quantity to isolate the em effects on the condensate .",
    "thus , the ferromagnetic - like nature of the chiral order parameter @xmath170 , within its low - energy representation , would require that this ratio is greater than one , or equivalently to this order , @xmath193 .",
    "that condition leads to the following lower bound for the combination of em lec involved to this order , neglecting the @xmath194 in ( [ emratiosu2 ] ) which changes very little the numerical results :    @xmath195+k_7^r\\geq \\frac{9c}{f^4}\\nu_{\\pi^0}. \\label{su2bound}\\ ] ]    we remark that the bound ( [ su2bound ] ) is independent of the low - energy scale @xmath94 at which the lec on the left - hand side are evaluated as long as the same scale is used on the right - hand side .",

    "the lec on the left - hand side could be estimated by fitting low - energy processes or theoretically from the underlying theory , with all the related subtleties commented above .",
    "the condition ( [ su2bound ] ) and the corresponding ones for @xmath1 that will be derived in section [ sec : boundssu3 ] are obtained as a necessary condition that the lec should satisfy if the qcd physical vacuum is ferromagnetic .",
    "this positivity condition on the quark condensate probes the vacuum by taking the mass derivatives ( [ conddef ] ) through the external source method so that the quark masses have to be kept different from zero and in that way the explicit symmetry breaking corrections are revealed in the condensate . if one is interested in the chiral limit , it must be taken only _",
    "after _ differentiation , i.e. , directly in eq.([emratiosu2 ] ) . in that case",
    ", it is not justified to perform the additional @xmath196 expansion in the charge because the @xmath72 masses vanish and one would be left only with the @xmath197 contribution in the r.h.s . of ( [ emratiosu2 ] ) , now with @xmath198 .",
    "that would actually give a larger negative value for the lower bound , coming from the smallness of the charged part of the pion mass ( see details below ) so that the bound in the chiral limit is less predictive .",
    "the fact that our bounds depend on quark masses is similar to other bounds on lec obtained from qcd inequalities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the main physical interest is to test this bound for physical masses , using different estimates of the lec in the literature .",
    "thus , as a rough estimate , setting @xmath199 770 mev and with the physical pion masses @xmath200 mev , @xmath201 mev , the bound ( [ su2bound ] ) gives @xmath202+k_7^r\\geq -6.32 ( 5.62)\\times 10^{-2}$ ] taking @xmath203 mev .",
    "this is a bit more restrictive than the  natural \" lower bound @xmath204 for the above lec combination , obtained by setting all of them to @xmath205 .",
    "the chiral limit gives @xmath206 ( with the value of @xmath43 discussed in section [ sec : numval ] and @xmath114 mev ) i.e. , much less restrictive , as commented above .",
    "more detailed numerical analysis will be done for @xmath1 in section [ sec : boundssu3 ] .    on the other hand , the maximum value for the ratio ( [ emratiosu2 ] ) for the @xmath135 within  natural `` values is obtained by setting the three of them to @xmath207 , giving @xmath208 , which gives an idea of the size of this correction .",
    "we remark that the term proportional to @xmath209 on the ratio ( [ emratiosu2 ] ) comes directly from the dependence of the pion masses on @xmath180 , so that it parametrizes the corrections in the condensate coming from any source of pion mass increasing , not only the em one .",
    "therefore , the same result can be used in order to provide a rough estimate of lattice errors in the condensate due to including heavier pion masses as lattice artifacts . in some lattice algorithms like the staggered fermion one ,",
    "the situation is very similar to the mass differences induced by the charge terms . in that formalism ,",
    "the finite lattice spacing induces terms @xcite that break explicitly the so called taste symmetry ( four different quark species or  tastes '' are introduced for every quark flavour ) leaving a residual @xmath210 symmetry , pretty much in the same way as the charge term in ( [ l2 ] ) . as a rough estimate , we",
    "can then replace @xmath211 by the corresponding @xmath196 from the lattice , obtained as the difference between the mass of the lightest lattice meson and the true pion mass . for a lattice pion mass of about 300 mev , the @xmath209 term in ( [ emratiosu2 ] ) gives a correction of about @xmath212 , which for a condensate value of ( 250 mev)@xmath213 represents about ( 5 mev)@xmath213 , which is within the order of magnitude quoted in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it should be taken into account that the staggered chpt @xcite has a much richer structure than the em terms considered here and in particular there will be other operators contributing to the condensates at tree level , multiplied by the pertinent low - energy constants . if those constants are of natural size , we expect the size of the corrections to the condensate to remain within the range quoted above .",

    "the discrepancy in the relatively large value of @xmath227 comes possibly from the bad convergence of the chpt series for the strange condensate , which in addition is very sensitive to the choice of @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the light condensates converge much better and although the sign of @xmath228 is under debate , its magnitude is very small . in the latter case ,",
    "our present calculation may become useful since the @xmath223 contribution may change the sign of the vacuum asymmetry , although its precise value to fit a given prediction for @xmath228 would still be subject to the @xmath129 value .",

    "in addition , we can still consider the light condensate @xmath279 as the order parameter of chiral transformations of the @xmath0 subgroup , which in principle will lead to a different constraint .",
    "in fact , the latter is nothing but the constraint obtained in the @xmath0 case ( [ su2bound ] ) , once the equivalence between the lec obtained in section [ sec : match ] is used . as for the full condensate",
    ", it should be kept in mind that the large violations of chiral symmetry due to the strange quark mass may spoil our simple description of small explicit breaking . as commented above ,",
    "this reflects in the large nlo contributions to the strange condensate , which in the standard chpt framework depends strongly on @xmath12 , unlike the light condensate .",
    "therefore , the bounds of the lec obtained for the full condensate are less trustable , since neglecting higher orders , say of @xmath280 is not so well justified for @xmath221 . proceeding then as in section [ sec : condsu2 ] , where the same prescription of charge splitting when comparing with qcd approaches is understood , we calculate the ratios :    @xmath281^{su(3 ) } & = & 1 + \\frac{4e^2}{9}\\left[6\\left(k_7+k_8^r(\\mu)\\right)+5\\left(k_9^r(\\mu)+k_{10}^r(\\mu)\\right)\\right]-\\frac{2c e^2}{f^4}\\left[2\\nu_{\\pi^\\pm}+\\nu_{k^\\pm}\\right]+{{\\cal o}}(\\delta_\\pi^2,\\delta_k^2)+{{\\cal o}}(p^4 ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{emratiosu3light } \\\\",

    "otherwise we should take into account that now @xmath285 , unlike the @xmath0 case , and @xmath286 , by terms of order @xmath15 .",
    "this is important when using this result for numerical estimates , since , as discussed before , the separation of the @xmath72 correction to the masses is formally not unique . as in @xmath0 ,",
    "the ratios ( [ emratiosu3light])-([emratiosu3full ] ) are finite and independent of the scale @xmath94 , of @xmath191 and of the not - em lec , so they are free of contact ambiguities .    as in section",
    "[ sec : condsu2 ] , we want to explore the consequences of the ferromagnetic nature of the physical qcd vacuum under explicit chiral symmetry breaking for the em lec . here also the charge - mass crossed terms in the fourth order lagrangian ( [ lag4su3 ] ) give explicit breaking contributions to the quark condensate coming now from the isoscalar , isovector and strangeness part of the charge matrix . for physical quark charges , demanding that the ratios ( [ emratiosu3light])-([emratiosu3full ] ) are greater than one we obtain the following em bounds , to leading order in the chiral expansion and in @xmath287 :    @xmath288    we remark that these constraints are independent of the low - energy scale @xmath94 .",
    "it is also clear that the light bound ( [ su3boundlight ] ) is nothing but the one obtained in the @xmath0 case ( [ su2bound ] ) once the equivalence between the lec given in the third equation of ( [ matchingprev ] ) is used . in figure",
    "[ fig : bounds ] we have plotted these two constraints in the @xmath289 plane at @xmath290 and within the natural region .",
    "we have used the same numerical values for the tree level lo masses , @xmath43 and @xmath22 as in previous sections .",
    "we observe that the bound on the full condensate is more restrictive than the light one in that range .",
    "however , as we have commented above , it is also less trustable , due to the large distortion of the chiral invariant vacuum due to the strange mass .",
    "both bounds give also a more restrictive condition than just the natural size .",

    "the lec are renormalized at @xmath290 and are plotted within the natural range . ]",
    "let us now check these bounds against some estimates of the @xmath126 in the literature .",
    "we start with the sum rule approach for @xmath291 in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "@xmath292 , but what is more relevant for us is that the combination @xmath293 at any scale is gauge - independent despite being both @xmath294 , @xmath269 dependent on the gauge parameter @xmath295 , as one can readily check from the explicit expressions given in @xcite ( c.f . their eqns .",
    "( 94 ) and ( 95 ) ) .",
    "this is an interesting consistency check of our present bounds ( [ su3boundlight ] ) and ( [ su3boundfull ] ) , which are gauge independent in addition to their @xmath94 low - energy scale independency commented previously , supporting their validity and predictive character .",
    "numerically , the constant @xmath294 could not be estimated in @xcite due to the slow convergence of the integrals involved , but they provide a numerical estimate for @xmath296 at @xmath297 gev and @xmath298 , for which we get @xmath299 from ( [ su3boundlight ] ) and @xmath300 from ( [ su3boundfull ] ) .",
    "see our comments about the @xmath130 scale dependence in section [ sec : condsu2 ]",
    ".    in @xcite resonance saturation gives @xmath301 , which is compatible with our present bound .",
    "this is apparently incompatible with a previous value for @xmath302 obtained in @xcite .",
    "the possible reasons to explain this difference were discussed in @xcite .",
    "that value for @xmath303 is compatible with our bounds as long as @xmath304 from ( [ su3boundlight ] ) and @xmath305 from ( [ su3boundfull ] ) .    in @xcite , based on large @xmath111 and the njl - model ,",
    "the lec estimates give @xmath306 , @xmath307 ( @xmath308 and @xmath309 are @xmath310 suppressed ) and @xmath311 , all of them at @xmath297 gev .",
    "these values are also compatible with both bounds ( [ su3boundlight ] ) and ( [ su3boundfull ] ) .",
    "we note that in @xcite , where the short - distance contributions are evaluated as in @xcite , the explicit expressions given for the lec show again that @xmath312 and @xmath223 are gauge independent .",
    "furthermore , @xmath294 and @xmath269 , dominant for large @xmath111 in that approach , show a rather large stability range in the @xmath130 scale around @xmath297 gev @xcite . since @xmath223 is the only combination surviving for large @xmath111 in our bounds , the comparison with those works is robust concerning the gauge and qcd scale dependence .",
    "in this work we have carried out an analysis of strong and electromagnetic isospin - breaking corrections to the quark condensates in standard one - loop chpt , providing their explicit expressions and studying some of their main phenomenological consequences for two and three light flavours .",
    "our results have allowed us to analyze the sensitivity of recent isospin - breaking numerical analysis of the condensates to considering all the em lec involved .",
    "the effect of those lec is smaller for individual condensates than for the vacuum asymmetry , where they show up already in the leading order .",
    "these corrections lie within the error range quoted in lattice analysis .",
    "our analysis can also be used to estimate corrections to the quark condensate coming from lattice artificially large meson masses .",
    "we have shown that if em explicit chiral symmetry breaking induces a ferromagnetic - like response of the physical qcd vacuum , as in the case of quark masses , one obtains useful constraints as lower bounds for certain combinations of the em lec , both in the two and three flavour sectors .",
    "we have explored the consequences of this behaviour for the ratios of @xmath147 to @xmath72 light and total quark condensates , which are free of contact - term ambiguities , and for a given convention of charge separation .",
    "the large chpt corrections to the strange condensate make the constraints on the full condensate less reliable . in this context",
    ", we have discussed the different sources for em explicit chiral symmetry breaking and isospin breaking terms , by considering formally arbitrary quark charges .",
    "thus , there are chiral symmetry breaking terms proportional to the sum of charges squared , coming from crossed charge - mass contributions in the effective action , which show up in the vacuum expectation value . in accordance with the external source method",
    ", we keep the quark masses different from zero to account correctly for all the explicit symmetry breaking sources .",
    "the chiral limit can be taken at the end of the calculation .",
    "the bounds obtained are explicitly independent of the low - energy scale @xmath94 , providing then a complete and model - independent prediction at low energies .",
    "however , when this low - energy representation is compared with theoretical estimates based on qcd , one has to take into account that due to the convention used in the charge separation , the estimated lec depend on the qcd renormalization scale @xmath130 , as well as being gauge dependent .",
    "our bounds are numerically compatible with those estimates , based on sum rules , resonance saturation and qcd - like models , within the stability range of @xmath130 where those approaches are reliable .",
    "furthermore , the lec combinations appearing in our bounds are gauge independent .",
    "we believe that our results can be useful in view of the few estimates of the em lec in the literature .",
    "we have found that the em correction to the sum rule relating condensate ratios is of the same order as the previously calculated @xmath72 one , and therefore must be taken into account when using this sum rule to estimate the relative size of quark condensates .",
    "we have actually showed that using the complete sum rule , which is also free of contact terms , yields a chpt model - independent prediction for the vacuum asymmetry compatible with the results quoted in the literature .",
    "finally , we have performed a matching between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 condensates , including all isospin - breaking terms .",
    "matching the sum and difference of light condensates gives rise to matching relations between the lec involved , where em and not - em lec enter on the same footing in the chiral expansion .",
    "these matching relations may be useful when working with physical masses and lec estimated by different approximation methods . in the case of the sum",
    ", the charge contribution is numerically small with respect to the pion mass one , but in the difference the two sources of isospin - breaking are comparable . taking the chiral limit , em and not - em constants decouple and the matching conditions are compatible with previous works for the lec in the lagrangian , which are defined in this limit .",
    "we collect here some results available in the literature and needed in the main text . to calculate the quark condensates",
    "to nlo one needs the @xmath313 lagrangians to absorb the divergences coming from loops with vertices from @xmath162 .",
