    "investigation of protein and colloidal systems has focused the attention of the scientific community on the phase - diagram behavior of short - range attractive potentials and of the role of the range of interaction in controlling the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the system@xcite .",
    "colloidal particles , due to their nano or microscopic size are often characterized by effective interactions@xcite whose range is significantly smaller than the particle diameter . under these conditions",
    ", it has been argued that the actual shape of the potential is irrelevant and that the thermodynamics@xcite , as well as the dynamics@xcite , of different systems approximately satisfy an extended law of corresponding states@xcite .",
    "this law allows for a comparison between different systems , once the effective diameter of the particle is known ( i.e. , when the repulsive part of the interaction can be mapped into an equivalent hard - sphere diameter  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the second virial coefficient , normalized by the corresponding hard - sphere second virial coefficient , @xmath7 may act as a proper scaling variable .",
    "therefore systems with equal second virial coefficient and effective diameter should have similar thermodynamical properties .",
    "the adhesive hard - sphere ( ahs ) potential@xcite , the limiting behavior of an infinitesimal interaction range coupled to infinite interaction strength such that @xmath8 is finite , has also received significant attention . for this potential @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , which acts as an effective scaled temperature , is the so - called stickiness parameter . despite the known thermodynamic anomalies@xcite , an analytic evaluation of the ( metastable ) critical point within the percus - yevick closure with both the energy and the compressibility routes for this potential is available@xcite . in the energy route",
    "the critical point is located at @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and number density @xmath13 .",
    "the availability of analytic predictions for this model has favored its application in the interpretation of experimental data for several disparate colloid ( and protein ) systems@xcite , an application whose validity has been reinforced by the extended law of corresponding states .",
    "for this reason , it is important to try to accurately estimate the properties of the ahs model as a reference , to support existing predictions or to suggest improvements to available theoretical approaches .",
    "numerical simulations of the ahs model have been attempted in the past@xcite .",
    "a recent effort in the direction of evaluating the phase diagram of the model has been provided by miller and frenkel@xcite , based on an ingenious identification of the appropriate monte carlo ( mc ) moves for this potential@xcite .",
    "their study provides an estimate of the location of the critical point at @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 .    in this article",
    "we propose a different approach to the numerical evaluation of the critical properties of the ahs model , based on extrapolation of standard grand canonical mc simulation results for a sequence of square well ( sw ) potentials with progressively smaller attraction ranges @xmath0 ( down to @xmath17 , in units of the hard - sphere diameter @xmath1 ) .",
    "the sw potential is defined as : @xmath18 the sw fluid has been profusely studied @xcite for @xmath19 .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that for @xmath20 gas - liquid separation becomes metastable with respect to the fluid - solid equilibrium . despite its metastable character , investigation of smaller @xmath0 values",
    "retains its importance , since the crystallization time is often much longer than the experimental one and gas - liquid phase separation is readily accessed ( an effect facilitated by the large difference between the fluid density and the crystal density and , in experiments , by the intrinsic sample polydispersity ) .    despite the importance of the sw model in relation to the ahs potential , no studies of the @xmath0-dependence of the critical point location has been previously reported for very small @xmath0 .",
    "this is in large part due to the fact that for smaller and smaller @xmath0 , the critical temperature significantly decreases . indeed , according to the constant @xmath2 prediction of noro and frenkel@xcite , it should vary as @xmath21^{-1}\\ ] ] making bond - breaking ( changes of the particle energy of order @xmath22 ) events rarer and rarer in the simulation .",
    "moreover , the size of the translational step in the mc code is of the order of @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the location of the critical point becomes more and more metastable which , in principle , poses a limit to the smallest @xmath0 which can be studied .    despite these numerical difficulties , we have been able to estimate the location of the critical point down to @xmath23 .",
    "we present here the @xmath0 dependence of the critical temperature and density and the values of the second virial coefficient and energy at the critical point . in all cases , a short linear extrapolation to @xmath24",
    "provides novel accurate estimates of the corresponding quantities for the ahs model .",
    "we have simulated the sw system in the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble in order to locate the gas - liquid critical point for different @xmath0 values .",
    "the critical point is identified by mapping the grand canonical density distribution onto the universal ising model distribution , following the method described by bruce and wilding@xcite .",
    "histogram rewighting @xcite was used to achieve an accurate estimate of the critical point , and the field mixing parameter was always found to be negligible .",
    "we define a monte carlo step as one hundred trial moves , with an average of 95% translation and 5% trial insertions or removals of one particle in the system .",
    "a translational move is defined as a displacement in a random direction by a random amount between @xmath25 .",
    "we simulate different realizations of the same system ( at the same chemical potential and temperature ) to improve statistics .",

    "the relation was also supported by a potential energy landscape interpretation of the generalized law of corresponding states@xcite which shows that configurations with the same boltzmann weight are generated under an isotropic scaling ( to change the inter - particle distances preserving the same bonding pattern ) and a simultaneous change of both @xmath0 and @xmath40 such that the bond free - energy remains constant .",
