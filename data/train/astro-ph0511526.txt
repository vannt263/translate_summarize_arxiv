    "lcbgs are viable candidates to explain , and eventually fill in , the missing faint red sequence of galaxies seen at @xmath15 ( de lucia et al . 2004 , goto et al",
    ". however , the high masses ( p97 ) , high metallicities ( kobulnicky & zaritsky 1999 ) , large extinctions ( hammer et al . 2001 ) , and centrally concentrated star - bursts ( barton and van zee 2001 ) seen in some lcbgs make them plausible candidates to be a burst phase of more massive spiral galaxies . both de s and more massive bulges are accreted populations in local clusters ( conselice et al .",
    "2001 ; biviano et al .",
    "2002 ) , but they have very different morphology - density relationships ( ferguson & bignelli 1994 ) . understanding the prevalance and distribution of lcbgs in clusters should constrain their role as a progenitor population .    in this letter",
    "we measure the density and clustering properties of lcbgs in two rich clusters ( table 1 ) : and .",

    "the cluster redshifts span an epoch where the dynamical mass of field lcbgs changes rapidly ( p97 ) , and are sufficiently disparate to permit the derivation of complementary field samples using the same data .",
    "observations were obtained with the wiyn 3.5 m telescope s mini - mosaic camera ( @xmath16 per pixel and @xmath17 field of view ) and augmented with archival hst wfpc2 and acs images for both clusters , reduced via the standard hst reduction pipeline .",

    "we use data from nights with good transparency and seeing ( fwhm @xmath21 arcsec ) .",
    "reduced mini - mo images are flat to within @xmath22 of their initial sky values .",
    "we created deep mosaics by combining only high quality data weighted by the ratio of the flux from an average star to the square root of the sky deviation and seeing for that image ( bershady , lowenthal , & koo 1998 ) .",
    "data were calibrated through : ( 1 ) spectro - photometric standard stars ( massey et al .",
    "1988 ) and landolt ( 1992 ) photometric stars observed during the wiyn 3.5 m runs ; ( 2 ) observations of landolt ( 1992 ) standards and cluster fields at the wiyn 0.9 m telescope ; ( 3 ) comparisons to the hst wfpc2 and acs observations ; ( 4 ) comparison of the observed stellar locus to that derived for our filter set from the gunn - stryker catalog ( gunn & stryker 1983 ) . through these methods , we estimate relative and absolute calibration uncertainties are below @xmath23 , assuming no large metallicity differences exist between the gunn - stryker catalog and our field stars .    object detection was performed on the sum of the ubriz images using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) with the criterion that objects contained @xmath24 contiguous pixels above @xmath25 of the sky noise .",

    "total magnitudes are set to the flux within an aperture which is a multiple of the @xmath26 radius ( @xmath27 is the petrosian ratio as defined by kron 1995 ) .",

    "photometric precision is 0.1 mag at @xmath31 for total and seeing - matched apertures , respectively .",
    "random errors for total magnitudes depend on the light - profile shape ; @xmath29-law profile errors are larger than the values quoted here for exponential profiles .",
    "photometric redshifts are determined through a method similar to csabai et al .",
    "we convolved a standard set of model and observed galaxy templates with our filters to produce a template - redshift grid for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "both fields have close to 100 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts ( ellingson et al .",
    "1998 ; postman et al . 1998 ) . for each field",
    "we match galaxies with high - quality spectroscopic redshifts and good photometry with points on the template - redshift grid , and correct the grid for differences between the simulated and measured colors .",
    "the trained grids yield photometric redshifts for every object with a precision @xmath34 ( blue objects ) and 0.03 ( red objects ) to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "absolute magnitudes , radii , rest - frame surface - brightness and colors were calculated for all objects using photometric or spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "k - correction calculations adopt method 4 of bershady ( 1995 ) .",
    "half - light radii were measured in the band closest to rest - frame b , and corrected for psf effects by quadrature subtraction of the stellar half - light radius .",
    "surface brightnesses in the wiyn images were corrected for seeing using measurements from the overlapping regions with the hst data .",
    "wiyn - based surface brightnesses have a 1.5 mag dispersion due to seeing - correction effects on the measured radii .",
    "we define lcbgs here as `` enthusiastic '' star forming galaxies . for these purposes ,",
    "we define lcbgs as having the following properties : @xmath37 and @xmath38 mag arcsec@xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the rest - frame b - band average surface brightness within the half - light radius . a galaxy with @xmath41 and a constant star formation rate will have @xmath42 and @xmath43 for ages more than a few @xmath44 10@xmath45 yr . a moderate amount of extinction , e.g. @xmath46 , will leave the galaxy with the above parameters .",
    "anything bluer or brighter will be more than an enthusiastic star former .",
    "the selection region for lcbgs is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "this region is mostly devoid of objects in local surveys ( e.g. , werk et al .",
    "2004 , garland et al . 2004 ) and is purposely constructed to identify actively star forming galaxies that are extreme compared to the local universe in clusters or the field . for comparison with other lcbg samples and to differentiate them from `` dwarf '' galaxies ( at least in luminosity ) , we also require lcbgs to have @xmath47 .",
    "galaxies were selected from the ground - based data set .",
    "we estimate , based on extant hst data , this selection misses @xmath48 of the bona - fide lcbgs ( primarily due to the error in the size measurement ) , while introducing the same percentage of false classifications .",
    "we identified `` cluster '' galaxies in our sample including lcbgs  as having a photometric redshift within @xmath49 of the cluster s redshift and a reasonable probability to be at the cluster redshift based on the individual photometric error and measurements from the training set ( brunner and lubin 2000 ) . within 1 mpc of the clusters centers , we find 41 candidate lcbgs .",
    "four objects are confirmed as cluster members through spectroscopic redshifts , and 23 are confirmed by having strong emission ( equivalent width greater than 10  ) in the `` on '' narrow - band image , which samples rest - frame [ oii]@xmath50 .",
    "we have 3 objects that are identified as cluster lcbgs , but have spectroscopic redshifts that place them outside of the cluster ( still within a redshift of 0.1 of the cluster ) and weak [ oii ] emission .",
    "the remaining 10 objects require spectroscopic follow - up to confirm cluster membership .",
    "we select two other groups of luminous ( m@xmath4 ) cluster galaxies in our data , red and blue , to compare to the lcbg population .",
    "we fit the color - magnitude relationship in both clusters , splitting the population according to the classic definition of the butcher - oemler effect ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ) : @xmath51 are `` bo '' galaxies , which include the lcbg population .",
    "the remainder are the red cluster sequence .",
    "we measure @xmath52 within @xmath53 mpc , rising to @xmath54 at @xmath55 mpc in ms0451 , in good agreement with ellingson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and de propris et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for cl1604",
    ", we measure @xmath56 within @xmath53 mpc , and rising to @xmath57 by @xmath55 mpc , as compared to the values of @xmath58 as measured by rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) .",
    "we plot the surface density of galaxies in figure 2 as a function of radius from the cluster center ( defined as the brightest cluster galaxy ) .",
    "the data extend to a radius where our completeness is still uniform in the wiyn images .",
    "two basic results emerge .",
    "( 1 ) all populations clearly show evidence of clustering . ( 2 )",
    "lcbgs form a statistically significant population in both clusters : @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the total population at @xmath61 and m@xmath4 ( for ms0451 and cl1604 , respectively ) , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the bo galaxies in each cluster .",
    "( errors are likely non - gaussian , and arise from cluster - membership uncertainties . ) for comparison , we estimate lcbgs constitute approximately @xmath64 and @xmath65 of all field galaxies blue enough to be classified as `` bo '' at @xmath66 and 0.9 .    we model the projected distribution of the lcbg , bo and red cluster populations with a king profile ( king 1972 ) and two spherical - shell density profiles .",
    "the king radius is set to the scale radius of the x - ray profile for each cluster ( donahue et al .",
    "2003 , lubin et al .",
    "spherical - shell models are empty inside of the x - ray scale radius ( `` shell '' ) or half this value ( `` half - shell '' ) , and then both decline as a king profile with a 1 mpc core radius .",
    "the king model fits all of the populations well in a @xmath67 sense .",
    "the red population is only fit well by the king model ; the bo populations are best fit by the half - shell model ; and lcbgs in ms0451 are best fit by the shell model , whereas the cl1604 lcbgs are best fit by the half - shell model .",
    "if lcbgs are distributed as a king profile , there is a @xmath68 probability we would detect @xmath69 lcbg in the inner 0.15 mpc region of ms0451 .",
    "therefore , lcbgs do not appear to exist in central cluster regions  in agreement with homeier et al .",
    "( 2005 ) findings for star forming galaxies in cl0152 ( z=0.84 ) .",
    "we compare the surface - density of cluster objects to the same objects in the field .",
    "red and bo galaxy field densities are calculated from the luminosity function of the deep2 data ( faber et al .",
    "2005 ) . with our selection criteria ,",
    "the field lcbg surface density derived from the p97 sample yields 1.2 and 5.44 @xmath70 at @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , after applying corrections due to their selection effects .",
    "we also use foreground lcbgs in the cl1604 field to estimate the field density of lcbgs at @xmath73 , and vice versa for ms0451 , to find @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xmath70 at @xmath71 and @xmath72 for objects with @xmath47 .",
    "field densities are calculated in the same redshift bin - size and manner as the cluster samples .",
    "we couch our comparison between the two objects in terms of `` enhancement : '' the surface - density ratio of cluster to field .",
    "the enhancement as a function of cluster - galaxy surface density ( figure 3 ) shows red galaxies behave qualitatively as expected according to the morphology - density relationship ( dressler et al .",
    "the bo galaxies show only a modest enhancement and trend with surface density .",
    "lcbgs display a larger enhancement , increasing with luminous ( m@xmath4 ) galaxy surface density , but dropping precipitously at surface densities above 150 mpc@xmath39 .",
    "we find lcbgs in two intermediate redshift clusters compose a significant fraction of the bo populations despite the clusters different redshifts , environments ( x - ray luminosities , and projected densities ) , and relative blue fractions . at lower redshift and greater `` richness '' ( ms0451 )",
    ", there is clear segregation in the surface - densities of sub - populations with red : bo : lcbg = 26.6:12.9:5.4 mpc@xmath39 within r@xmath76 . in cl1604",
    "the different populations have comparable densities ( red : bo : lcbg = 8.9:15.8:8.5 mpc@xmath39 ) . at luminous - galaxy surface - densities of 100 mpc@xmath39 , the enhancement of these different sub - populations relative to the field",
    "are a factor of 2 - 4 for bo galaxies , 8 - 20 for lcbgs , and 30 - 50 for red galaxies in both clusters .",
    "this is suggestive of lcbgs as progenitors of populations found preferentially in clusters today . because lcbgs show significant enhancement variations between clusters and with surface - density , a secure interpretation of lcbgs as a progenitor population awaits better sampling of environment and redshift .",
    "an analysis of 10 clusters between @xmath77 is forthcoming .",
    "here we suggest that since they appear to be physically small , if lcbgs fade , des and low - mass s0s would be one plausible remnant population .    despite their similar spatial distribution , lcbgs are an extreme sub - component of the bo population in terms of their cluster enhancement , color , and surface - brightness .",
    "if lcbgs are on predominantly radial orbits , their cluster - shell enhancement indicates initial in - fall  a spectroscopically testable claim . in this scenario ,",
    "their star - bursts are plausibly triggered through galaxy interactions in the cluster periphery , where densities are enhanced but interaction times still long , or via interactions with the intercluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the former supposition is testable via angular correlation measurements of large samples .",
    "a correlation between the x - ray emission and position of the lcbgs would support an icm - driven trigger for the star - bursts .",
