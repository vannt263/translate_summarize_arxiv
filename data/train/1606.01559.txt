    "in contrast with the classical tverberg theorem , the best known bounds for @xmath11 are not tight . in @xcite , larman proved that @xmath12 garca - coln showed that @xmath13 in her phd thesis @xcite , later published in @xcite .",
    "this was later generalized by strausz and sobern who gave the general bound @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "later , mulzer and stein gave the bound @xmath15 which improves the previous bound for @xmath16 and is tight for @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "[ thm : main ] for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath23 we have that @xmath25    this improves all previously known upper bounds whenever @xmath5 is large compared to @xmath2 and @xmath23 , and comes with a matching lower bound .",
    "the proof follows from studying the behavior of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath8 and using the erds - szekeres theorem for cyclic polytopes in @xmath1 .",
    "we include a short review of cyclic polytopes and the erds - szekeres theorem in section [ sec : prelim ] . in [ sec : alternating ] we prove a useful lemma about alternating partitions of a cyclic polytope which leads to an interesting open problem .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is detailed in section [ sec : remarks ] .",
    "in this section we introduce some definitions and recall some well known concepts which we later use in the proofs of this paper .      any ordered set @xmath26 with the property that the orientation of any ordered subset of @xmath7 with @xmath27 elements is always the same",
    "is called an _ order - type homogeneous set_.    a classic example of such a set is the set of vertices of a cyclic polytope , @xmath7 , which is constructed as follows : consider the moment curve @xmath28 , given real numbers @xmath29 define @xmath30 the set @xmath31 is the @xmath23-dimensional _ cyclic polytope _ on @xmath32 points and any other polytope combinatorially equivalent to the cyclic polytope is also sometimes referred to as a cyclic polytope or , more generally , as an order - type homogeneous set .",
    "order - type homogeneous sets have been studied extensively @xcite and have proven to be very useful as examples with extremal properties in various combinatorial problems . in our case they will prove useful in finding better bounds for the tolerated tverberg number @xmath11 .",

    "another useful fact when working with order - type homogeneous sets is lemma 2.1 from @xcite :    [ lem : ot ] an ordered set @xmath42 in general position in @xmath1 is order - type homogeneous if and only if the polygonal path @xmath43 intersects every hyperplane in at most @xmath23 points , with the exception of the hyperplanes that contain an edge of @xmath44 .      in 1935",
    "erds and szekeres proved two important theorems in combinatorial geometry @xcite .",
    "the first erds - szekeres theorem implies that any sequence of numbers with length @xmath45 always contains a monotonous ( either increasing or decreasing ) subsequence .",
    "the second erds - szekeres theorem states that among any @xmath46 points in the plane there are @xmath32 of them in convex position .",
