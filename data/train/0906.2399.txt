    "in the field of heavy - ion fusion reactions two major issues have been discussed in recent years .",
    "one issue is how to explain the hindrance of fusion at low energies , that is the steep falloff of the measured fusion cross sections , which has been observed in many heavy - ion systems at energies far below the coulomb barrier ( see ref . @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the hindrance is often so strong that the @xmath2 factor for fusion develops a maximum at low energy , and it has been a challenge to reproduce this behavior in coupled - channels calculations .",
    "the other issue is the suppression of high - energy fusion data , which is observed when the data are compared to conventional one - dimensional or coupled - channels calculations @xcite .    a practical solution to the problems mentioned above has been to adjust the parameters of the woods - saxon shaped , ion - ion potential that is used in the calculations .",
    "thus it has been realized that by using a large diffuseness ( in combination with a deep potential and a small radius parameter ) one can often resolve the problem of a suppression at high energy @xcite .",
    "however , the diffuseness that is required to reproduce the high - energy data , for example , in the fusion of @xmath3o+@xmath4pb , is different from the value that is needed to fit the low - energy data @xcite .",
    "moreover , the values are often unrealistic and much larger than the empirical diffuseness which has been extracted from analyses of elastic scattering data or obtained from double - folding potentials @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that a large diffuseness is also inconsistent with quasi - elastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "a good example on a system where both of the above mentioned problems exist is the fusion data for @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr @xcite .",
    "the problems were solved in the original analysis of the data by using a large diffuseness , @xmath5 = 0.85 fm , instead of the empirical value , @xmath5 = 0.677 fm ( eq .",
    "( iii.44 ) of ref .",
    "the measurements @xcite were later supplemented with two new low - energy data points @xcite and they confirmed that the @xmath2 factor for this system does develop a maximum at low energy .    instead of using an ion - ion potential with an anomalously large diffuseness ,",
    "the double - folding technique is applied to construct an ion - ion potential which has a realistic behavior at large distances and is adjusted at small distances between the reacting nuclei to produce a shallow pocket in the entrance channel potential @xcite .",
    "the potential used is the so - called m3y+repulsion potential and the construction of it is described in ref .",
    "the basic feature of this potential is that the existence of a shallow pocket in the entrance channel makes it possible to explain the steep falloff of the fusion data at low energies , and it also helps explaining the measured fusion cross sections at high energies @xcite .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the high - energy data , it is often necessary to include a short - ranged , imaginary potential in the calculations of the cross sections @xcite .",
    "the m3y+repulsion potential is applied in coupled - channels calculations of the fusion cross section for @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr .",
    "the purpose is to demonstrate that the energy dependence of the measured @xmath2 factor for fusion can be reproduced at low energies by employing this potential .",
    "it is also shown that the calculated cross sections at high energies are sensitive to the nuclear potential and to the nuclear structure input , and it is possible to reproduce the high - energy data by using a realistic structure input and employing the m3y+repulsion potential , in combination with a short - ranged imaginary potential .    finally , the hindrance in the fusion of other ca+zr isotopes at low energies is discussed and compared with the systematics we have developed previously @xcite , and predictions are made of the energy where the @xmath2 factor for fusion is expected to develop a maximum in those cases where it has not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "the construction of the double - folding ion - ion potential for @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr is based on the effective m3y interaction which is supplemented with a contact term for the exchange part @xcite .",
    "the densities are parametrized as fermi functions with the radius 3.675 fm and diffuseness 0.525 fm for @xmath0ca , and the radius 5.02 fm and diffuseness 0.55 fm for @xmath1zr .",
    "these two densities produce the rms matter radii of 3.45 and 4.39 fm , respectively , which are consistent with the measured charge radii .",
    "the m3y double - folding potential ( including exchange ) is illustrated by the lowest dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ pot4896 ] .",
    "it is unrealistic at short distances between the two nuclei because it is much deeper than the ground state energy of the compound nucleus .",
    "the m3y interaction has therefore been corrected by supplementing it with a repulsive term as described in ref .",
    "the densities that are used in calculating the associated repulsive , double - fording potential have a sharper profile , with the diffuseness @xmath6=0.4 fm , but the radii are the same as used above to calculate the ordinary m3y double - folding potential .",
    "the strength of the repulsive contact term , @xmath7 = 507 mev , was adjusted to produce the nuclear incompressibility @xmath8 = 223 mev .",
    "the entrance channel potential for the m3y+repulsion potential is illustrated by the upper solid curve in fig .",
    "[ pot4896 ] .",
    "it has a rather shallow pocket inside the coulomb barrier .",
    "also shown is the entrance channel potential obtained from a woods - saxon ( ws ) potential , which is similar to the empirical akyz - winther potential @xcite .",
    "the slightly adjusted parameters of this ws potential are @xmath9 = -77.18 mev , @xmath10 = 9.686 fm , and @xmath5 = 0.677 fm .",
    "they produce the same coulomb barrier height , @xmath11 = 95.4 mev , as the m3y+repulsion potential but the pocket is deeper .",
    "the fusion cross sections obtained in the coupled - channels calculations that are based on these two potentials are essentially the same at energies close to the coulomb barrier but differ at energies far below the coulomb barrier .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",

    "the coupling between the one- and two - phonon states is assumed to be vibrational ( harmonic ) , except for the quadrupole excitation of @xmath0ca for which we use a weaker one- to two - phonon coupling strength ( see table i ) which is based on the known @xmath18 transition strength @xcite .",
    "the conventional assumption @xmath19 does not work so well for @xmath0ca .",
    "the empirical nuclear coupling strengths that will be used are shown in the last column of table i. they are expressed in terms of the values of @xmath20 and were determined by analyzing measurements of the inelastic scattering of @xmath3o on @xmath0ca @xcite .",
    "the fusion cross sections are determined by imposing ingoing - wave boundary conditions at the position of the minimum of pocket in the entrance potential .",
    "the results of coupled - channels calculations are compared in fig .",
    "[ 4896f ] to the data of refs . @xcite .",
    "the top dashed ( green ) curve is based on the empirical woods - saxon potential discussed in the previous section .",

    "the solid ( red ) curve in fig . [ 4896f ] is the coupled - channels result obtained with the m3y+repulsion potential .",
    "it reproduces the data very well at low energies but is below the data at high energies .",
    "the latter problem can be solved as mentioned earlier by employing short - ranged imaginary potential .",
    "the explicit form used below is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radial distance between the reacting nuclei at the minimum of the pocket , and the diffuseness @xmath24 is set to 0.2 fm .",
    "the effect of the imaginary potential , eq .",
    "( [ w(r ) ] ) , is illustrated below ( see fig .",
    "[ 4896lf ] . )",
    "the effect of couplings on the calculated fusion cross section is very strong .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the coupled - channels calculations to the no - coupling limit which is shown by the lower dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ 4896f ] .",
    "the effect is to shift the calculated cross section by roughly 45 mev to lower energies .",
    "the couplings produce some interesting features in the barrier distribution for fusion @xcite , which is defined as the second derivative of the energy - weighted fusion cross section with respect to the center - of - mass energy @xmath25 , @xmath26 the barrier distributions , which are shown in fig . [",
    "48962d ] , were calculated by the finite difference method using the same energy step @xmath27 = 2 mev that was used in the earlier work @xcite .",
    "the measured distribution is broad and contains several peak structures .",
    "the red solid curve in fig . [ 48962d ] is the distribution derived from the coupled - channels calculations that are based on the m3y+repulsion potential .",
    "it is broad and consists of two strong peaks but the shape is not in good agreement with the data .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that some of these peak structures in the measured barrier distribution can be reproduced by including up to three - phonon excitations of the octupole mode in @xmath1zr .",
    "the blue dashed curve in fig . [ 48962d ] is the barrier distribution one obtains by considering up to five phonon excitations of the octupole mode in @xmath1zr in the coupled - channels calculations .",
    "the other excitations shown in table i were not included in these calculations for practical reasons .",
    "the shape of the distribution ( the blue dashed curve ) seems to trace the four peak structures of the measured distribution rather well , and it appears to be in better agreement with the data than the three - phonon calculation presented in ref .",
    "it is obvious from this comparison that the calculated barrier distribution is very sensitive to multiphonon excitations of the soft octupole mode in @xmath1zr .",
    "the fusion cross section obtained in the calculation that is based on up to five - phonon octupole excitations has an average deviation of about 10% from the data ( i.  e. , we need a systematic error of 10% in order to obtain a @xmath28 per point of 1 ) , whereas the solid curve in fig .",
    "1 deviates on average by 7% .",
    "it is possible that one would be able to improve the overall fit to the data by including more channels in the calculation .",
    "however , such a calculation would probably not be very realistic because of the sensitivity to the empirically poorly known multiphonon excitations .",
    "the main point we want to make is that the standard calculation , which is based on couplings to one- and two - phonon excitations , provides a reasonable fit to the data and by applying the m3y+repulsion potential it is possible to reproduce the fusion hindrance observed at energies far below the coulomb barrier .",
    "the low - energy behavior of the fusion cross sections is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 4896sf]a in terms of the @xmath2 factor for fusion , which is defined by , @xmath29 where @xmath25 is the center - of - mass energy , @xmath30 is the sommerfeld parameter , and @xmath31 is the relative velocity .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath2 factor for the coupled - channels calculations that are based on the woods - saxon potential keeps increasing with decreasing energy .",
    "the calculation based on the m3y+repulsion potential , on the other hand , develops a maximum before it goes to zero near 86.2 mev , which is the energy of the pocket minimum for the m3y+repulsion potential shown in fig .",
    "[ pot4896 ] .",
    "the calculated fusion cross section must go to zero at this energy because we use a real potential at low energy and use ingoing - wave boundary conditions to determine the fusion probability .",
    "the coupled - channels calculations that are based on the m3y+repulsion potential provide the best description of the low - energy @xmath2 factor data shown in fig .",
    "[ 4896sf]a .",
    "in fact , the @xmath2 factor data have just reached a maximum at the lowest energies , which is a characteristic feature for the onset of the fusion hindrance phenomenon in systems with a negative q - value for fusion , and this feature is reproduced by using a shallow entrance channel potential .",
    "the extrapolation to very low energies , which will be discussed later on , is also shown in the figure .",
    "it has a nearly parabolic shape and the lowest data points are seen to fall on the top of this curve .    another way to illustrate",

    "they both intersect the upper ` constant @xmath2 factor ' line , which is the logarithmic derivative one obtains by assuming a constant @xmath2 factor @xcite , @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the reduced mass number . at the point where @xmath35 intersects with @xmath36",

    "this calculation is suppressed compared to the data , as already pointed out in the discussion of fig .",

    "the result obtained with the woods - saxon potential ( with diffuseness @xmath5 = 0.677 fm ) and the structure input from table i is shown by the blue dashed curve which is difficult to see because it is essentially identical to the solid curve in fig .",

    "this seems to contradict the results discussed above , where the woods - saxon potential with ` normal ' diffuseness provided an excellent description of the high - energy data when applied in coupled - channels calculations .",
    "the reason for this apparent contradiction is that the structure input of table i is different from the structure input used in ref .",

    "the @xmath2 factor for the system @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr , which was already shown in fig .",

    "inserting such a constant value of @xmath49 and the energy @xmath37 into eq .",

    "the values of @xmath37 are also far below the reference value @xmath52 for some of the other ca+zr systems .",
    "this is partly caused by the softness of the reacting nuclei or by transfer reactions .",

    "we conclude that there are strong indications of a fusion hindrance at low energy in the data for @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr .",
    "the @xmath2 factor does reach a maximum at the lowest energies and there is a preference among the coupled - channels calculations presented here for those that are based on a shallow potential in the entrance channel . in this respect , the fusion data exhibit the same characteristics that have been observed in many other heavy - ion systems @xcite .",
    "the systematics of the fusion hindrance in other ca+zr systems , where it has not yet been confirmed experimentally , was discussed and predictions were made of the energy @xmath37 where the @xmath2 factor for fusion is expected to develop a maximum .",
    "this energy can be far below the energy predicted by the empirical formula , which was developed for systems consisting of stiff or closed shell nuclei .",
    "the deviation of @xmath37 from the empirical formula seems to correlate with the number of valence neutrons in the reacting nuclei , which may reflect an increased softness or a stronger effect of neutron transfer .",
    "the behavior of the high - energy fusion data can also be reproduced by applying the shallow potential in the coupled - channels calculations but that requires an additional weak absorption that acts near the minimum of the potential pocket .",
    "the calculated , high - energy cross sections are sensitive to the nuclear structure input parameters . by applying the structure input which has been extracted from inelastic scattering data it is possible to reproduce the high - energy data , even with a woods - saxon potential that has a normal diffuseness .    the energy dependence of the fusion cross section in the barrier region was also investigated .",
    "this region is best studied in terms of the extracted barrier distribution , which is usually very sensitive to the low - lying nuclear structure input in the coupled - channels calculations .",
    "the calculated barrier distribution for @xmath0ca+@xmath1zr turned out to be very sensitive to multi - phonon excitations , in particular of the soft octupole node in @xmath1zr .",
    "the best agreement with the measured barrier distribution was achieved by including excitations up to five phonons of this excitation mode .",
    "unfortunately , the empirical knowledge of the nuclear structure at such high excitation energies is poor and many other reaction channels may also affect the barrier distribution .",
    "it is therefore a serious challenge to theory to determine a credible nuclear structure input and explain the measured barrier distribution in detail .",

    "<S> thus the observed @xmath2 factor for fusion , which develops a maximum at low energy , can be reproduced fairly well . </S>",
    "<S> the high - energy data can also be accounted for but that requires the use of a weak , short - ranged imaginary potential that absorbs the incoming flux near the location of the minimum of the potential pocket . </S>",
    "<S> predictions of the fusion hindrance in other ca+zr systems are made and are compared with the systematics that has been developed previously . </S>"
