    "the evaluation of performance measures of risk models is an important problem that has been widely studied in the literature @xcite . under the presence of heavy - tailed claim sizes ,",
    "these evaluations become more challenging and sometimes even problematic @xcite . in such cases , it is necessary to construct approximations for the quantity under consideration . in this paper , we develop a new method to construct reliable approximations for performance measures of heavy - tailed risk models .",
    "we use the classical risk model ( perhaps outdated , but very well studied ) as a context and vehicle to demonstrate our key ideas , which we expect to have a much wider applicability in insurance .",
    "we show that our approximations have a provably small absolute error , independent of the initial capital , and a small relative error . as additional test of performance",
    "we also consider the finite horizon aggregate loss model .",
    "there are three main directions for approximating ruin probabilities : phase - type approximations , asymptotic approximations and error bounds .",
    "when the claim sizes follow some light - tailed distribution , a natural approach to provide approximations for the ruin probability with high accuracy is by approximating the claim size distribution with a phase - type one @xcite .",
    "we refer to these methods as _ phase - type approximations _ , because the approximate ruin probability has a phase - type representation @xcite . however , in many financial applications , an appropriate way to model claim sizes is by using heavy - tailed distributions @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the exponential decay of phase - type approximations gives a big relative error at the tail and the evaluation of the ruin probability becomes more complicated .",
    "when the claim size distribution belongs to the class of subexponential distributions @xcite , which is a special case of heavy - tailed distributions , asymptotic approximations are available @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage of such approximations is that they provide a good fit only at the tail of the ruin probability , especially for small safety loading .",
    "another stream of research focuses on corrected diffusion approximations for the ruin probability @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of such asymptotic techniques is the requirement of finite higher moments for the claim size distribution .",
    "finally , results on error bounds @xcite indicate that such bounds are rather pessimistic , especially in terms of relative errors , and in case of small safety loading",
    ". there exist also bounds with the correct tail behavior under subexponential claims @xcite , but these bounds are only accurate at the tail .",
    "a conclusion that can be safely drawn from all the above is that , although the literature is abundant with approximations for the ruin probability in the case of light - tailed claim sizes , accurate approximations for the ruin probability in the case of heavy - tailed claim sizes are still an open topic .    besides the ruin probability , a very popular tool in real - world applications to measure",
    "the operational risk is the value at risk ( var ) @xcite . for a given portfolio ,",
    "a var with a probability level @xmath0 and fixed time horizon is defined as the threshold value such that the loss on the portfolio over the given time horizon exceeds this value with probability @xmath1 .",
    "it is of interest to quantify the operational risk through the statistical analysis of operational loss data @xcite and provide error bounds for the aggregate loss probability @xcite . similarly to the ruin probability , things become more complicated under the presence of heavy - tailed data @xcite .    in this paper , we develop approximations for ruin probabilities and total losses under heavy - tailed claims that combine desirable characteristics of all three main approximation directions .",
    "first , our approximations maintain the computational tractability of phase - type approximations .",
    "additionally , they capture the correct tail behavior , which so far could only be captured by asymptotic approximations , and they have the advantage that finite higher - order moments are not required for the claim sizes .",
    "last , they provide a provably small absolute error , independent of the initial capital , and a small relative error .",
    "the idea of our approach stems from fitting procedures of the claim size distribution to data .",
    "heavy - tailed statistical analysis suggests that for a sample with size @xmath2 only a small fraction ( @xmath3 ) of the upper - order statistics is relevant for estimating tail probabilities @xcite .",
    "more information about the optimal choice of the @xmath4th upper order statistic can be found in @xcite .",
    "the remaining data set may be used to fit the bulk of the distribution .",
    "since the class of phase - type distributions is dense in the class of all positive definite probability distributions @xcite , a natural choice is to fit a phase - type distribution to the remaining data set @xcite . as a result , a mixture model for the claim size distribution",
    "is a natural assumption .",
    "thus , our key idea is to use a mixture model for the claim size distribution in order to construct approximations of the ruin probability that combine the best elements of phase - type and asymptotic approximations .",
    "we now sketch how to derive our approximations when the claim size distribution is a mixture of a phase - type distribution and a heavy - tailed one . interpreting the heavy - tailed term of the claim size distribution in the mixture model as perturbation of the phase - type one and using perturbation theory , we can find the ruin probability ( total loss ) as a complete series expansion .",
    "the first term of the expansion is the phase - type approximation of the ruin probability ( total loss ) that occurs when we ",
    "remove \" the heavy - tailed claim sizes from the system , either by discarding them or by replacing them with phase - type ones .",
    "we consider the model that appears when all heavy - tailed claims are removed as the  base \" model . due to the two different approaches of removing the heavy - tailed claim sizes , the ruin probability ( total loss )",
    "connects to two different base models and consequently to two different series expansions .",
    "we show that adding the second term of the respective series expansions is sufficient to construct improved approximations , compared to their phase - type counterparts , the _",
    "discard _ and the _ replace approximations _",
    ", respectively . since the second term of each series expansion works as a correction to its respective phase - type approximation , motivated by the terminology _ corrected heavy traffic approximations _",
    "@xcite , we refer to our approximations as _ corrected phase - type approximations_. therefore , in this paper , we propose the _ corrected discard approximation _ and the _ corrected replace approximation_. both approximations have appealing properties : the corrected replace approximation tends to give better numerical estimates , while the corrected discard approximation is simpler and yields guaranteed upper and lower bounds .",
    "last , we provide the form of the _ corrected phase - type approximations _ for the aggregate loss over a fixed time period , and we show that they have the same appealing properties also for finite time .    within risk theory , some attention has been given to perturbed risk models ; see @xcite for a review and the recent paper of @xcite .",
    "however , the term  perturbation \" in this area is used to denote the superposition of two risk processes .",
    "contrary to other asymptotic techniques that use perturbation analysis to approximate the ruin probability @xcite , our approach is different ; we apply perturbation to the claim sizes rather than the arrival rate .    the connection between ruin probabilities and the stationary waiting probability @xmath5 of a g / g/1 queue , where service times in the queueing model correspond to the random claim sizes , is well known @xcite .",
    "thus , the corrected approximations can also be used to estimate the waiting time distribution of the above mentioned queue .",
    "finally , since the reserve process of the classical risk model is a basic building block of any lvy process @xcite , and due to the connection of ruin probabilities with scale functions @xcite , we expect that our technique is widely applicable to more general risk processes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s.power series expansion ] , we introduce the model and we derive two series expansions for the ruin probability . from these series expansions we deduce approximations for the ruin probability , in section  [ s.approximations ] , and we study their basic properties . in section  [ s.example ] , we find the exact formula of the ruin probability for a specific mixture model and we study the extent of the achieved improvement when we compare our approximations with phase - type approximations of their related base model . in section  [ s.var ] , we provide corrected phase - type approximations of the aggregate loss in finite time and we show through a numerical study that our approximations give excellent var estimates . finally , in the appendix",
    ", we give all the proofs .",
    "as proof of concept , we apply our technique to the classical cramr - lundberg risk model @xcite . in this model",

    "the claim sizes @xmath9 are i.i.d .  with common distribution @xmath10 and independent of @xmath11 .",
    "motivated by statistical analysis , which proposes that only a small fraction of the upper - order statistics is relevant for estimating tail probabilities , we consider that an arbitrary claim size @xmath12  is phase - type @xcite with probability @xmath13 and heavy - tailed @xcite with probability @xmath14 , where @xmath15 . in the forthcoming analysis , we use as general rule that all parameters depending on @xmath14 bear a subscript with the same letter .",
    "we assume that the phase - type claim sizes @xmath16 and the heavy - tailed claim sizes @xmath17 have both finite means , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath20 is the initial capital , our risk reserve process has the form @xmath21    using this model , we first examine in sections  [ s.power series expansion][s.example ] the ruin probability in infinite time horizon , and later on , in section  [ s.var ] , we move to finite time horizon and we examine the aggregate loss .    when calculating ruin probabilities , for mathematical purposes , it is more convenient to work with the claim surplus process @xmath22 .",
    "the probability @xmath23  of ultimate ruin is the probability that the reserve ever drops below zero or equivalently the probability that the maximum @xmath24 ever exceeds @xmath20 ; i.e. @xmath25    for a distribution @xmath26 we use the notation @xmath27 for its @xmath2th convolution and @xmath28 for its complementary cumulative distribution @xmath29",

    "when the average amount of claim per unit time @xmath33 is strictly smaller than 1 , the well - known pollaczek - khinchine formula @xcite can be used for the evaluation of the ruin probability .",

    "the infinite sum of convolutions at the right - hand side of makes the evaluation of @xmath23  difficult or even impossible for our mixture model . for this reason ,",
    "one typically resorts to laplace transforms .",
    "we use the notation @xmath37 , @xmath38  and @xmath39  for the laplace transforms of the stationary excess claim sizes @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which means that the phase - type claims are responsible for average claim @xmath45 per unit time and the heavy - tailed claims are responsible for average claim @xmath46 per unit time . using this notation",
    ", we obtain @xmath47 . in terms of laplace transforms",
    ", the pollaczek - khinchine formula can be written now as : @xmath48    applying laplace inversion to to find @xmath23  is difficult @xcite or even impossible , because the heavy - tailed component @xmath39  oftentimes does not have an analytic closed form . to overcome this difficulty , a phase - type approximation would suggest to  remove \" the heavy - tailed claim sizes and find an explicit phase - type representation for the ruin probability of the resulting simpler model , which we use as base model for our analysis . in broad terms",
    ", we view the heavy - tailed claim sizes as perturbation of the phase - type claim sizes and we interpret @xmath14 as the perturbation parameter . with the aid of perturbation analysis",
    ", we find the ruin probability of our mixture model as a complete series expansion with first term the phase - type approximation that results from its base model .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we remove the heavy - tailed claims either by discarding them or by replacing them with phase - type ones .",
    "therefore , the ruin probability @xmath23  connects to two different base models and , consequently , it has two different series expansions , the discard and the replace expansions .",
