    "in the aim of deploying the internet of things ( iot ) , designing a unified radio access technique for both machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications and handheld mobile devices is a challenging problem .",
    "one major issue is the difference in terms of traffic patterns and qos requirements  @xcite between these two types of communications .",
    "another issue is the large number of iot devices required to be simultaneously served .",
    "further difficulties arise from the fact that m2 m transmissions do not all have the same qos profile and traffic characteristics  @xcite .    to address some of these challenges , the third generation partnership project ( 3gpp )",
    "has started to add m2m - type communications support into the radio access subsystem of lte .",
    "several proposals emerged within this work .",
    "two of them are dubbed lte for machine - type communications ( lte - m ) and narrow - band lte - m ( nb lte - m ) , each introducing a new user equipment ( ue ) category , the so - called cat .",
    "1.4mhz for lte - m and cat .",
    "200khz for nb lte - m  @xcite .",
    "as their respective names indicate , these new ue categories restrict m2 m transmissions to a small subband of the available bandwidth that is orthogonal to the broadband users .",
    "the same principle is used in filtered - ofdm  @xcite with the difference that in filtered - ofdm , subband - based filtering is applied to enable the use of a different transmission time interval ( tti ) and ofdm numerology on the m2 m subband .",
    "other solutions consist in providing a separate network for m2 m connections .",
    "examples include lora@xmath0 and sigfox@xmath0  @xcite , which both operate in the unlicensed frequency bands .",
    "while the physical layer of sigfox@xmath0 is based on frequency - division multiple access ( fdma ) with ultra narrow band sub - channels , the technology adopted in lora@xmath0  @xcite employs is a mix of fdma and of chirp spread spectrum  @xcite .",
    "however , none of the existing solutions is able to meet the following crucial requirements all at once .",
    "denser iot deployment : * the existing proposals offer significant improvement over current cellular standards in terms of support for iot access but there is a need to support much larger numbers of simultaneous m2 m transmissions .",
    "this goal should be met without sacrificing the qos of broadband mobile services .",
    "+ * 2 . multi - class users / services : * not enough attention has been paid to the different qos and traffic profiles within the class of iot devices . indeed ,",
    "many of these devices _ will not all be battery limited sensors and will not only emit small packets of data _  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a need to distinguish from within the services running on handheld devices those that have traffic characteristics and data rate requirements , e.g. short messages , previously considered to be typical of iot services .",
    "significant gains in resource utilization efficiency are expected from a multiple - access scheme that treats devices with different qos profiles , whether handheld devices or iot machines , as belonging to separate classes of users .",
    "+ * 3 . flexibility in resource assignment : * the new multiple - access scheme should be flexible in assigning resources to the different classes and to the different users within each class . + * 4 .",
    "efficiency in resource utilization : * the new multiple - access scheme should be more efficient in resource utilization than the orthogonal schemes adopted in all the existing proposals .",
    "consider a cell containing a base station ( bs ) required to serve @xmath1 users in the _",
    "_ uplink__. assume that these users are grouped into @xmath2 classes defined as follows .    *",
    "* one maximum data rate ( hd ) class : * here , hd stands for `` high data rate '' . for this class",
    "the objective is to obtain a data rate _ as high as possible _ for a given number of users .",
    "typically , these users are associated to data hungry applications on handheld devices . * * @xmath3 constant data rate ( ld ) classes : * here , ld stands for `` low data rate '' . for these classes ,",
    "the objective is to accommodate _ as many users as possible with granted data rates _ @xmath4 that satisfy @xmath5 these users",
    "are typically associated with fixed low - rate transmissions from both handheld devices ( such as short messages ) and from different types of iot services .    in the sequel",
    ", we use @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) to designate the indexes of the users of the hd ( resp . the @xmath8-th ld ) class .",
    "we also define @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "since what matters for hd users is maximizing throughput , proper scheduling techniques will limit the number of simultaneously - transmitting users , thus it is reasonable to assume that @xmath14 will be small .",
    "this observation leads us to use multiuser detection techniques for this class of users . on the other hand",
    ", ld users will be quite numerous so that multiuser detection would be too complex .",
    "therefore , we propose the use of single - user detection for this class of users . moreover , to allow for high - performance hd connections , we want to limit interference from ld transmissions on hd received signals , we thus let hd and ld users to be quasi - orthogonal to each other .",
    "lastly , this quasi - orthogonality is implemented in the code domain using a novel _ class - dependent hierarchical spreading _ scheme .    in the rest of this article",
    "we show how such a multiple - access scheme has the desirable property that the available radio resources are used in a _ flexible and efficient _ manner to allow connecting not only a large number of iot devices , but also a large number of handheld devices running relatively low data rate services , while guaranteeing the satisfaction of the broadband services with high qos requirements .",
    "this flexibility and efficiency in using the available resources is to be contrasted with the existing access solutions for iot , such as lora@xmath0 , sigfox@xmath0 and lte - m , where the resources reserved for iot services are under - used and their proportion to the overall resources can not be dynamically adjusted .",
    "the moma transmitter ( @xmath15 ) is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : moma_principle ] .",
    "let @xmath16 be an orthogonal - code matrix , e.g. walsh - hadamard , whose columns are @xmath17-long spreading codes . in moma for @xmath18 classes of users ,",
    "the set of columns of matrix @xmath16 is divided into @xmath18 disjoint subsets that form @xmath18 matrices , namely @xmath19 and @xmath20 with respective dimensions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 spreading sequences of @xmath19 will be assigned to @xmath24 hd users .",
    "typically , @xmath25 so that the hd users could be scheduled in a quasi - orthogonal manner .",
    "this inequality could however be violated in the case where the spatial dimension is exploited , as we will see .",
    "the @xmath26 columns of @xmath27 will be shared among the users of the @xmath8-th ld class .",
    "the scenario of interest for moma is when @xmath28 , i.e. ld resources are overloaded , and when the following inequalities motivated by are satisfied : @xmath29 the transmitted signals of the @xmath30 users within each ld class  @xmath8 are formed by means of first linearly combining their data symbols using a rectangular _ combining _ matrix @xmath31 of dimensions @xmath32 , before spreading the resulting symbols using the columns of matrix @xmath27 . applying this class - dependent hierarchical spreading ,",
    "the final spreading code @xmath33 of a ld user  @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35_{j_k^{\\mathrm{ld}}},\\quad k\\in\\mathcal{k}_l^{\\mathrm{ld } } , l\\in\\{1 \\cdots l-1\\}\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the index of the column of the matrix @xmath37 assigned to user  @xmath38 and where @xmath39_{i , j}$ ] designates the @xmath40-th element of the @xmath41-th column of matrix @xmath42 . in principle",
    ", @xmath31 could be any @xmath32 matrix chosen such that the transmit power constraint is respected : @xmath43_{u , j}\\right|^2=1\\:.\\ ] ] in the following , we assume that the components of @xmath31 are chosen as realizations of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables that can take the values @xmath44 and @xmath45 with equal probabilities .",
    "in contrast to ld users , no combining is applied to the symbols of the users from the hd class .",
    "the spreading code @xmath33 used on the signals of a user @xmath46 can thus be written as @xmath47_{j_k^{\\mathrm{hd}}},\\quad k\\in\\mathcal{k}^{\\mathrm{hd}}\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath39_j$ ] designates the @xmath41-th column of matrix @xmath42 and where @xmath48 is the index of the code assigned to user  @xmath46 from among the columns of @xmath19 .",
    "class dependent hierarchical spreading is distinct from the 2-step spreading ( the so - called channelization and scrambling steps  @xcite ) used in third - generation ( 3 g ) systems .",
    "indeed , multiplication with @xmath31 is intended to precondition signals from a number of users so that they can be spread using a _ much smaller _ number of orthogonal codes .",
    "this operation is thus completely unrelated , in its conception and in its purpose , to both channelization and scrambling in 3 g .",
    "an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) implementation of moma ( that we designate as moma - ofdm ) consists in mapping the @xmath17 symbols from users spread signals to @xmath49 consecutive subcarriers ( scs ) in one ofdm symbol , where @xmath50 is the total number of scs per ofdm symbol .",

    "moma - ofdm combines the benefits of both frequency - domain spreading , e.g. the ability to harvest the frequency diversity of the channel and the robustness against carrier frequency shifts , and of ofdm transmission , e.g. robustness against timing errors .",
    "we now turn our attention to the case where bs is equipped with a large number @xmath61 of antennas while each user is equipped with a single antenna .",
    "this massive mimo scenario , which is expected to be prevalent in 5 g networks , proves to be particularly advantageous for moma , from both the performance and the receiver complexity perspectives .",
    "we designate this implementation of moma as mimo - moma . due to the spatial multiplexing capabilities inherent to this scenario",
    ", the number of hd users would typically be larger than the number of available hd orthogonal codes , i.e. @xmath62 . the @xmath23 columns of matrix @xmath19 should thus be shared among the @xmath24 hd users in such a way that each column is reused by @xmath63 users .",

    "<S> one of the key requirements for fifth - generation ( 5 g ) cellular networks is their ability to handle densely connected devices with different quality of service ( qos ) requirements . in this article , we present multi - service oriented multiple access ( moma ) , an integrated access scheme for massive connections with diverse qos profiles and/or traffic patterns originating from both handheld devices and machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) transmissions . </S>",
    "<S> moma is based on a ) establishing separate classes of users based on relevant criteria that go beyond the simple handheld / m2 m split , b ) class dependent hierarchical spreading of the data signal and c ) a mix of multiuser and single - user detection schemes at the receiver . </S>",
    "<S> practical implementations of the moma principle are provided for base stations ( bss ) that are equipped with a large number of antenna elements . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is shown that such a massive - multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) scenario enables the achievement of all the benefits of moma even with a simple receiver structure that allows to concentrate the receiver complexity where effectively needed . </S>"
