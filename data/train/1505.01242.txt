    "wte@xmath0 , which crystallizes in a distorted , orthorhombic variant of the cdi@xmath0 structure with octahedral coordination around w , was recently reported to display an extremely pronounced and non - saturating magnetoresistance which@xcite . following simple arguments already discussed by pippard@xcite",
    ", this effect was attributed to a nearly perfect compensation between the density of electrons and holes .",
    "evidence for electron / hole compensation was recently provided by angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments claiming to observe electron- and hole - like fermi surface pockets of almost the same size@xcite .",
    "these results contrast markedly with a subsequent arpes study@xcite which claim to observe up to 9 fs sheets , including a hole - pocket at the brillouin zone center or the @xmath3-point , and two hole - pockets and two electron - pockets on each side of @xmath3 and along the @xmath3-_x _ direction .",
    "the same study finds evidence for spin - orbit split bands and for an opposite texture between the spin and the angular orbital momentum around the @xmath3-point which should suppress carrier backscattering@xcite .",
    "the application of a magnetic field would not only alter the spin texture , it would also displace , through the zeeman effect , the spin - split bands relative to the fermi level , opening backscattering channels and hence increasing the resistivity .",
    "similar arguments were invoked to explain the pronounced magnetoresistivity observed in cd@xmath4as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "electrical transport studies focused on the shubnikov - de haas - effect yielding results @xcite which contrast markedly with both arpes studies .",
    "the first study reports the observation of just 3 fermi surface pockets in marked contrast with band structure calculations which always predict an even number of fs pockets for bulk wte@xmath0@xcite .",
    "subsequent studies , more in line with the calculations , observe 4 fermi surface pockets , or two sets of concentric electron- and hole - like fss@xcite at either side of the @xmath5point .",
    "the angular dependence of the observed frequencies , or of the fs cross - sectional areas obtained from the onsager relation , suggests ellipsoidal pockets with volumes yielding an excess of 4 % in the density of holes when compared that of the electrons .",
    "this imbalance would be comparable to that of elemental bi which , in contrast to wte@xmath0 , displays a saturating magnetoresistance@xcite .",
    "subsequent calculations @xcite confirm the previously reported fs geometry @xcite , while analyzing the topological properties of its electronic structure around the fermi level .",

    "it remains unclear how such electronic structure would contribute to wte@xmath0 pronounced magnetoresistivity .",
    "ref . also finds that its fs is particularly sensitive to the exact position of the fermi level @xmath7 , with small displacements in @xmath7 leading to topological lifshitz transitions , in agreement with our dft calculations being discussed within this manuscript .    here , we present angle- and temperature - dependent magnetoresistivity measurements in fields up to @xmath8 t on wte@xmath0 single - crystals , in an attempt to elucidate the number of fermi surface sheets . in parallel , we performed density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations incorporating the spin - orbit effect . by adjusting the position of the chemical potential we attempted to precisely describe the geometry of the measured fermi surfaces . in agreement with a previous report@xcite",

    ", their angular dependence can be described in terms of ellipsoidal fss .",
    "therefore , we find that the dft calculations are unable to correctly describe the angular dependence of the fs cross - sectional areas , particularly in what concerns the hole - pockets . for fields aligned along the @xmath9 and the @xmath10axis we observe the effective masses to become renormalized , i.e. considerably heavier as the field increases . as the fft spectrum of the oscillatory signal , taken on a limited field window , is unable to resolve all cross - sectional areas , we fit it to five and four lifshitz - kosevich components .",
    "our fits clearly indicate that one can not fit the sdh signal over the entire field range by maintaining the frequencies and the effective masses as constants .",
    "good fits are obtained within a limited field range , confirming that the effective masses ( and likely the cross - sectional areas ) are field - dependent .",
    "wte@xmath0 was grown via a chemical vapor transport technique using chlorine as the transport agent : w ( 99.999 % ) and te ( 99.9999 % ) were heated up to a peak temperature of 750 @xmath11c at a rate of 100 @xmath11c / h , and subsequently cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 10 @xmath11c / h .",

    "indeed this would lead to a total number of 9 fermi surface sheets .",
    "nevertheless , their cross - sectional areas would strongly disagree with our experimental observations .",
    "furthermore , the different arpes studies @xcite disagree among themselves on the existence of this extra pocket . as we show below , the dft calculations indicate that the geometry of the fermi surface(s ) is extremely sensitive with respect to small displacements of the fermi level , i.e. of the order of 20 mev , which is comparable to the experimental resolution of arpes .",

    "f__@xmath33 t , which clearly corresponds to @xmath34 .",
    "this frequency was previously attributed to magnetic breakdown or to the magnetic field - induced carrier tunneling between both orbits@xcite . however , the fact that the amplitude of the peak associated with _ _ f__@xmath35 is more pronounced than peaks associated with the fundamental orbits , such as @xmath36 , contradicts this scenario , unless both fs sheets were in close proximity at the point of nearly touching .",
    "in fact , as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( c ) , which displays the fft spectra acquired under distinct field intervals , this orbit becomes progressively more pronounced at higher fields , which is consistent with magnetic breakdown .",
    "however , as illustrated by the fft spectrum extracted from the field interval ranging from 8 to 20 t , the amplitude of @xmath37 can , in some field intervals , become more pronounced than the amplitude of all other fundamental peaks .",
    "this suggests that the zeeman - effect is altering the geometry of the @xmath1-pockets , hence decreasing their ( spin - orbit induced ) splitting in some region(s ) of _ k_-space .",
    "our dft analysis , discussed below , is indeed consistent with this possibility .",
    "this would imply that the electronic structure at the fermi level evolves with field due to the zeeman - effect .",
    "we considered this hypothesis and evaluated the possibility of studying in detail the evolution of the sdh frequencies , and of the concomitant effective masses , as a function of the field . but as illustrated by the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( c ) , the resolution among peaks in the fft spectra , or the peak sharpness , decreases considerably when the very low field interval is excluded from the oscillatory signal , thus preventing such a detailed analysis .",
    "figures [ fig:3 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) display the amplitude of each peak observed in the fft spectra as a function of the temperature @xmath38 , for fields along the @xmath39 , @xmath10 , and the @xmath9axis , respectively .",
    "solid lines are fits to the lifshitz - kosevich formula @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being the effective mass @xmath42 and @xmath43 the average field value ) , from which we extract the effective masses",
    ". as seen , the fits are excellent and yield precise values for @xmath42 .",
    "more importantly , according to the fits in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( d ) , the effective mass of @xmath37 , or @xmath44 , is found to evolve as a function of the field : i.e. @xmath45 for @xmath46 ranging from 3 to 13 t , @xmath47 for fields between 8 and 20 t , @xmath48 for fields ranging from 15 to 35 t. in table i below summarizes the experimental information extracted from this study , including effective masses for @xmath49 and to the @xmath10axis , in each case extracted from two intervals in field , i.e. a low field region and the whole field window up to 35 t. as seen , the effective masses extracted from the whole field range are approximately a factor of 2 heavier than those extracted from the low field region , clearly indicating a renormalization of the effective mass induced by the application of a magnetic field . in the same table",
    "we include the results of an attempt to match the experimentally determined fss with those determined from the dft calculations by independently adjusting the position of the electron- and hole - bands relative to the fermi level .",
    "[ fig:32 ]    a renormalization of the effective masses necessarily implies the evolution of the electronic structure at the fermi level due to the application of an external field .",
    "such an evolution is likely to affect the geometry of the fermi surface . to test this hypothesis in fig .",
    "[ fig:32 ] we attempt to fit the oscillatory component , or the sdh signal superimposed onto the magnetoresistivity to the five frequencies observed in the fft spectrum .",
    "however as illustrated by figs .",
    "5 ( a ) and ( b ) it is _ not _ possible to fit the sdh signal over the entire field range to 5 lifshitz - kosevich components ( 4 fundamental frequencies plus @xmath37 ) , each composed of a sinusoidal term whose amplitude is normalized by @xmath50 , the exponential dingle factor ( whose argument is effective mass and scattering rate dependent ) and the temperature factor @xmath51^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath1 is a constant . as seen in fig . 5 ( a ) , for fields below @xmath52 t one can fix the frequencies to the values obtained from the fft spectrum and obtain a good fit of the experimental data over an extended range in @xmath19 if one considers the experimental noise and a less than perfect background subtraction . however , as seen in fig . 5 ( b )",
    "if one attempts the same exercise for fields beyond 10 t one can not converge to a fit describing the oscillatory signal over the entire @xmath19 range .",
    "this is particularly surprising given that this window in inverse field @xmath53 is shorter than the interval @xmath54 previously used for fig .",
    "5(a ) . as illustrated by figs .",
    "5 ( c ) and ( d ) it is nevertheless possible to converge to good fits if one splits this interval into two intervals , i.e. from 10 to 18.6 t and from 18.6 to 35 t. for fields beyond 10 t we were unable to simultaneously resolve @xmath36 and @xmath55 ; the fits systematically converge to an average value between both frequencies and to another frequency around 400 t ( curiously detected in the fft spectra shown in the inset of fig .",
    "this is likely attributable to the limited interval in @xmath19 .",
    "hence , we have re - done the analysis after removing one lk component ( blue traces ) which does not compromise the fits .",
    "the important observation is that @xmath56 increases from 93 t ( in the field interval @xmath57 3.5 to 10 t ) to 103 t ( @xmath57 18.6 to 35 t ) , @xmath58 from 132 to 145 t and @xmath59 to 187 t. one could argue that the fits of the highest field oscillatory data are not excellent and hence question the validity of the obtained frequencies .",
    "however , here we have shown that it is _ not _ possible to fit the entire field range with _ fixed _ frequencies and effective masses :",
    "the dingle and temperature factors also depend on the field interval chosen for the fits .",
    "together with the previously shown effective mass renormalization , this indicates that the electronic structure of wte@xmath0 evolves with field due to the zeeman splitting .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we show kohler plots of the resistivity @xmath17 normalized by its zero field value @xmath60 as a function of the square of the field @xmath61 normalized by @xmath60 and for fields along all three crystallographic orientations .",
    "recently , it was claimed@xcite that wte@xmath0 would _ not _ obey the kohler rule@xcite , leading to an anomalous linear magnetoresistance for currents parallel to the field . however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , our data clearly follows kohler scaling with very mild deviations for fields along the @xmath10axis , and only for the curves taken at higher temperatures . at lower fields , and for fields along the @xmath39axis , indeed @xmath62 . since for this current / field configuration",
    "the lorentz force is nearly zero , which leads to no orbital magnetoresistivity , a very careful experimental effort , such as very precise field - alignment and homogeneous current distribution will be required to characterize this effect .",
    "the fact that wte@xmath0 nearly obeys kohler rule for all three crystallographic orientations implies that its orbital magnetoresistivity is dominated by scattering by phonons and impurities .",
    "[ fig:5 ]    one of the main goals of this study is to compare the geometry of the experimentally detected fss with those resulting from _ ab - initio _ calculations such as the ones included in refs .  .",
    "notice that the initial calculations @xcite ignored spin - orbit coupling , implying the existence of one hole- and one electron - like pocket .",
    "this would be at odds with the results reported by ref .  . in this paper ,",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed by using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package @xcite(vasp ) within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "we have included the contribution of spin - orbit coupling in our calculations .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange correlation functional @xcite and the projected augmented wave ( paw ) methodology @xcite was used to describe the core electrons .",
    "the 5__d _ _ and 6__s _ _ electrons for w and the 5__s _ _ and 5__p _ _ electrons for te were treated as valence electrons in all our calculations . the energy cut off for the plane - wave basis was chosen to be 600 mev .",
    "a total of 96 bands and a @xmath63point mesh of @xmath64 were used for the self - consistent ground state calculations .",
    "a total of 100 @xmath63points were chosen between each pair of special @xmath63points in the brillouin - zone for the band - structure calculations .    in order to obtain an accurate and detailed representation of the fermi surface we have used a @xmath65 k - point mesh .",
    "the areas of the observed and calculated fs orbits are related to the sdh frequencies by the onsager relation , @xmath66 where @xmath67 tm@xmath68 is the quantum of flux and @xmath69 is the area of the electron orbit perpendicular to the field .",
    "the effective masses of the electron- and the hole - pockets at these extremal orbits are determined by using the relation : @xmath70 we have calculated the areas of the orbits by considering cuts of the fermi surface with planes intersecting the fermi surface perpendicularly to the _ a_- , _ b_- and the _ c_-axis at various different angles . in an attempt to match the experimentally observed fss with the calculated ones , we chose to adjust our calculations to the experimental cross - sections obtained for fields along the _ c_-axis .",
    "for this , the energy of the electron pockets were down shifted with respect to the fermi level by an amount of 25 mev , while the hole pockets were displaced upwards by 20 mev .",
    "the fermi surfaces were generated using the eigenvalues obtained from vasp and were visualized using the xcrysden software @xcite .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , the resulting fermi surface is composed of two sets of spin - orbit split pockets at either side of the @xmath3-point and along the @xmath3-x direction , with the electron - like pockets being depicted in blue or clear blue color , and the hole - like in red or in clear and nearly transparent red .    in table  [ table:1 ] below , we summarize the experimental results as well as those resulting from the dft calculations .",
    "in particular , we present a comparison between the experimental effective masses @xmath42 , extracted from the fits in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , and the band masses @xmath71 resulting from the dft calculations . here ,",
    "the important observation is not only the marked contrast between the band masses and the experimental effective - masses with the band masses being systematically heavier ( in particular for the @xmath1-orbits ) , but also their field dependence .",
    "as seen in table  [ table:1 ] , the effective masses are strongly field dependent , increasing by nearly a factor of 2 when they are extracted from the whole field range as compared with the masses extracted from the low field region .",
    "this is a very clear indication for the role of the magnetic field in altering the electronic structure at the fermi level and in leading to a concomitant increase in the density of states at the fermi level @xmath72 . for samples that start to display quantum oscillatory behavior under fields @xmath73 t it is remarkable , as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( c ) , that one can not resolve all four peaks in the fft spectrum when it is taken over a broad range in @xmath46 , such as @xmath74 t. however , as illustrated in the supplemental material @xcite through simple simulations of the experimental data , this just reflects the much lower number of oscillations within this inverse field range when compared to the number of oscillations observed in fields ranging from @xmath75 t up to 9 t.    .comparison between the experimental results and the results of the dft - calculations .",

    "[ fig:7 ] we illustrate the effect on the geometry of the fss of displacing the position of the fermi - level by 10 and 20 mev both above and below the fermi surface .",
    "these displacements are intended to give us a rough idea of the role played by the zeeman - effect on the geometry of the spin - orbit split fss .",
    "the role of the zeeman term is different for each one of the spin - orbit - coupling split pockets and different for electron and hole pockets and this effect is reversed when the magnetic field is applied in the opposite direction .",
    "furthermore , the amount of the zeeman splitting depends on @xmath84 since the mixing of the atomic orbitals in forming the bloch states changes for different values of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , we can not infer the precise role of the zeeman term by simply shifting the fermi level as in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] . nevertheless the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] conveys the sensitivity of the geometry of fermi surfaces sheets with respect to an applied field .",
    "notice that the hole - pockets change significantly by displacing the fermi level by a small amount in energy , i.e. , of the order of just 10 mev , which would correspond to a zeeman splitting of the order of 100 t. the change is more dramatic when the fermi level is shifted upwards .",
    "this exercise implies that the zeeman - effect could induce pronounced changes in the geometry of the fss altering the balance between opposite spin carriers .",
    "notice also how the hole - pockets extracted from the dft calculations , which present a boomerang like cross - section , nearly touch at its vertex when the fermi level is displaced .",
    "non - concentric fermi surfaces like these would favor the magnetic breakdown between both orbits as experimentally seen .",
    "in summary , by analyzing the angular dependence of the shubnikov - de - haas oscillations in single - crystals , we detect four fermi surface cross - sectional areas in the semi - metal wte@xmath0 . by following density functional theory calculations ,",
    "we conclude that they correspond to spin - orbit split electron- and hole - pockets or two sets of concentric pockets at either side of the @xmath3-point .",
    "nevertheless , the experimentally observed angular dependence for the cross - sectional areas is poorly described by the dft calculations .",
    "their geometry is well - described in terms of ellipsoidal pockets as suggested by ref . .",
    "the discrepancy between the _ ab - initio _ calculations and the experimentally determined cross - sectional areas is far more pronounced for the hole - pockets .",
    "we observed four sdh frequencies ( and not three as claimed by ref . ) which are in excellent agreement with those reported in refs . , indicating that the geometry of the extracted fermi surfaces does _ not _ dependent on sample quality ( for samples with resistivity ratios between @xmath85 ) .",
    "we , as well as ref  , attribute the two middle frequencies to electron - pocket(s ) , with the other two corresponding to the hole one(s ) .",
    "in contrast to ref  , we attribute this geometry to the spin - orbit splitting of the hole and electron fermi - surfaces . on the other hand ref .  , based on their pressure dependent studies combined with band structure calculations , attributes the middle two frequencies @xmath58 and @xmath55 to electron- and hole - orbits , respectively .",
    "based on our angular - dependent study , this indexation would necessarily imply a sizeable difference in volumes between the electron- and the hole- fermi surfaces , and therefore result in a pronounced lack of carrier compensation at zero - field . here",
    ", we emphasize that our choice for the indexation of the fermi surfaces in combination with the volumes of the extracted ellipsoidal fermi surfaces , do _ not _ discard near perfect compensation between electron- and hole - densities at zero- or low fields . by performing measurements up to higher fields",
    "we find experimentally that the effective masses in wte@xmath0 are renormalized by the magnetic field , increasing considerably as the field increases .",
    "this is consistent with our fits of the oscillatory sdh signal as a function of the inverse field ( to several lifshitz - kosevich components ) .",
    "these fits also indicate that the fundamental frequencies are evolving with field . both observations point towards a magnetic field",
    "induced modification of the electronic structure at the fermi level or a fermi surface that is responsive to a magnetic field .",
    "our dft calculations as well as those in ref . indicate that the geometry of the fermi surface in wte@xmath0 is very sensitive to the exact position of the fermi level .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising to find that the spin - up and spin - down fermi surfaces can be slightly modified by the zeeman - effect , which apparently is displacing the ( spin - dependent ) density of states at the fermi - level towards van - hove singularities .",
    "we believe that this effect could have a relevant influence on the observed colossal magnetoresistivity of wte@xmath0 .",
    "in a 3d landau - fermi liquid , the quasiparticle lifetime decreases with increasing quasiparticle energy difference from the fermi energy @xcite . if , upon application of a strong magnetic field the fermi surface was altered , one should expect a strong influence on the quasiparticle scattering rates and lifetimes , contributing perhaps in a non - trivial manner to the large magnetoresistance observed in wte@xmath0 .    finally , the lack of agreement between our experimental observations and the band structure calculations has important implications .",
    "for example , the absence of a precise knowledge of the electronic structure at the fermi level makes it difficult , or nearly impossible , to predict its topological properties @xcite .",

    "<S> here , we present a detailed study on the temperature and angular dependence of the shubnikov - de - haas ( sdh ) effect in the semi - metal wte@xmath0 . this compound was recently shown to display a very large non - saturating magnetoresistance which was attributed to nearly perfectly compensated densities of electrons and holes . </S>",
    "<S> we observe four fundamental sdh frequencies and attribute them to spin - orbit split , electron- and hole - like , fermi surface ( fs ) cross - sectional areas . </S>",
    "<S> their angular dependence is consistent with ellipsoidal fss with volumes implying a modest excess in the density of electrons with respect to that of the holes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that density functional theory ( dft ) calculations fail to correctly describe the fss of wte@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> when their cross - sectional areas are adjusted to reflect the experimental data , the resulting volumes of the electron / hole fss obtained from the dft calculations would imply a pronounced imbalance between the densities of electrons and holes . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for field - dependent fermi surface cross - sectional areas by fitting the oscillatory component superimposed onto the magnetoresistivity signal to several lifshitz - kosevich components . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a pronounced field - induced renormalization of the effective masses . taken together , our observations suggest that the electronic structure of wte@xmath0 evolves with the magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> . this evolution might be a factor contributing to its pronounced magnetoresistivity . </S>"
