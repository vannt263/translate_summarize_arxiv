    "the existence of the top quark as the weak isospin partner of the bottom quark was already discussed in 1977 with the discovery of the bottom quark and hence a third quark generation .",
    "the self consistency of the standard model ( sm ) both required the existence of the top quark and allowed for increasingly precise predictions of properties like its mass from electroweak precision measurements .",
    "the top quark finally was discovered in 1995 by the cdf and d0 collaborations  @xcite in the mass range predicted by the sm , completing the sm quark sector .",
    "+ with a mass of 170.9 @xmath2 1.8 gev  @xcite , the top quark exhibits both the largest and the most precisely measured quark mass .",
    "it is the fermion coupling most strongly to the higgs boson , and due to its extremely short lifetime of @xmath3  s , it is the only quark that decays before it can hadronise , allowing the study of the decay of an essentially free quark . + measuring the production cross section of the top quark and its different properties such as mass , electric charge , @xmath0 boson helicity in its decay , branching fraction b(@xmath1 ) , _ etc .",
    "_ , and comparing with predictions of the sm is a very powerful tool in searching for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the recently recorded large datasets at the run  ii tevatron allow for never - before - performed measurements of top quark properties like the electric charge , while other measurements like the top mass reach such a precision that they start to become limited by systematic uncertainties .",
    "+ this article focusses on the production of top quarks in pairs via the strong interaction using datasets with an integrated luminosity of up to 1  fb@xmath4 .",
    "it also includes some measurements that became available shortly after the conference date .",
    "the production of single top quarks via the electroweak interaction with a first evidence observed by d0 is discussed in a different article in these proceedings @xcite . a detailed description of the cdf and d0 detectors can be found in @xcite .",
    "in @xmath5  collisions at a centre of mass energy @xmath6 tev , top quarks are produced predominantly in pairs : @xmath5  @xmath7 @xmath8  + x via the strong interaction ( 85% @xmath9  annihilation and 15% gluon - gluon fusion ) . at next - to - next - to - leading order ,",
    "the corresponding sm cross section is 6.77 @xmath2 0.42 pb for a top quark mass of 175 gev  @xcite . according to the sm",
    ", the top quark decays predominantly into @xmath0 bosons and @xmath10-quarks .",
    "hence , there are three event classes to be observed resulting from @xmath8  decay , which depend on the decay mode of the @xmath0 bosons : + * ( i ) * a so - called _ dilepton _ final state where both @xmath0 bosons decay leptonically , resulting in two isolated high-@xmath11  leptons , missing transverse energy  corresponding to the two neutrinos and two jets , * ( ii ) * a",
    "_ lepton+jets _ final state where one @xmath0 boson decays leptonically , the other one hadronically , resulting in one isolated high-@xmath11  lepton ,  and four jets , and * ( iii ) * an _ all - hadronic _ final state where both @xmath0 bosons decay to @xmath12 pairs , producing six jets . in all final states ,",
    "two of the jets are @xmath10-jets ( originating from the hadronisation of a @xmath10-quark ) .",
    "additional jets can arise from initial and final state radiation .",
    "+ the all - hadronic final state represents the biggest branching fraction of @xmath8  events ( @xmath1346% ) , but it is also difficult to separate from the large multijet background .",
    "the dilepton final state not counting @xmath14 leptons constitutes @xmath135% of the @xmath8  events and gives the cleanest signal but suffers from low statistics .",
    "the lepton+jets events in the @xmath15+jets or @xmath16+jets channels yield @xmath1329% of the branching fraction and provide the best compromise between sample purity and statistics .",
    "measurements of the top quark pair production cross section provide an important test of the predictions from perturbative qcd calculations at high transverse momenta .",
    "analysing different decay channels helps to improve statistics of top events and studies of properties , as well as the probing of physics beyond the sm that might result in enhancement / depletion in some particular channel via novel production mechanisms or decay modes . instead of quoting single cross section results in the following subsections ,",
    "all current measurements are summarised in figure  [ fig : xsec ] .",
    "+ due to the selection of datasets enriched in top quark pairs and the necessity of understanding object identification , background modelling and sample composition , cross section measurements form the foundation for all further property analyses like the ones described in the subsequent sections of this article .",
    "dilepton events are usually selected by requiring two isolated high @xmath11  leptons ,  and at least two central energetic jets in an event .",
    "the main physics backgrounds exhibiting both real leptons and  arise from z/@xmath17+jets production with @xmath18 and the production of dibosons ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "instrumental backgrounds mainly arise from misreconstructed  due to resolution effects in z/@xmath17+jets production with @xmath20 , but also from @xmath0+jets and qcd multijet production where one or more jets fake the isolated lepton signature .",
    "while the physics backgrounds are estimated from monte carlo , the instrumental backgrounds are usually using data .",
    "+ the selected data samples can be further enriched in signal by requiring additional kinematical event properties like the scalar sum of the jet @xmath11s @xmath21 to be above a certain threshold or discarding events where both leptons have the same electric charge .",
    "the purities in these samples are usually quite good with a signal to background ratio ( s / b ) better than 2 at least , but the statistics are low . to enhance the acceptance for dilepton final states and especially include `` 1  prong '' hadronic @xmath14 decays , the selection can be loosened to require only one fully reconstructed isolated lepton ( @xmath22 ) in addition to an isolated track ( `` @xmath23+track analysis '' ) .",
    "+ a first measurement of the lepton+tau final state was recently performed by d0 , using events with hadronically decaying isolated taus and one isolated high @xmath11  electron or muon . in this case , the sample purity was enhanced by requiring @xmath10-jet identification in the event .",
    "the result is shown together with other measurements in figure  [ fig : xsec ] .",
    "lepton+jets events typically are selected by requiring one isolated high @xmath11  lepton ( @xmath22 ) ,  and at least 4 jets .",
    "the main physics background here comes from @xmath0+jets production while the main instrumental background arises from qcd multijet production where a jet fakes the isolated lepton signature .",
    "accordingly selected samples exhibit a s / b around 1/2 . + it is possible to extract the cross section using either purely topological and kinematic event properties combined in a multivariate discriminant to separate the @xmath8  signal from background , or by adding identification of @xmath10-jets .",
    "an advantage of topological analyses is that they do not depend on the assumption of 100% branching of @xmath1 and are therefore less model - dependent than tagging analyses . requiring @xmath10-jet identification , however , is a very powerful tool to further suppress the backgrounds which typically exhibit little heavy flavour content , allowing for signal extraction in lower jet multiplicities and providing very pure signal samples : a s / b @xmath24 10 can easily be achieved in selections requiring at least four jets if two identified b - jets are required .",
    "+ @xmath10-jets can be identified based on the long _ lifetime _ of b hadrons resulting in significantly displaced secondary vertices with respect to the primary event vertex or large significant impact parameters of the corresponding tracks . combining this type of information into a neural network tagging algorithm , @xmath10-tagging efficiencies of about 54%",
    "are achieved while only about 1% of light quark jets are misidentified as @xmath10-jets , resulting in an improved s / b in tagged analyses .",
    "a second way to identify @xmath10-jets is to reconstruct _ soft leptons _ inside a jet that come from semileptonic",
    "b decays  so far only soft-@xmath16 tagging has been deployed in @xmath8  analyses .",
    "+ using lifetime @xmath10-tagging , d0 was also able to perform a first @xmath14+jets cross section analysis , using events with hadronically decaying isolated taus  the result is shown together with other measurements in figure  [ fig : xsec ] .      to study the all - hadronic final state , events with at least six central energetic jets and no isolated high @xmath11  leptons",
    "are selected .",
    "since qcd multijet production represents a background which is orders of magnitude larger than the signal process , @xmath10-jet identification is mandatory for this final state . to allow further separation of signal and background , multivariate discriminants based on topological and kinematic event properties",
    "are deployed .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec ] shows an overview of recent cross section measurements performed by cdf and d0 .",
    "all measurements are in good agreement with the sm prediction and with each other  the single best measurements reaching a relative precision of @xmath25=12% . with increasing datasets , these measurements naturally start to become limited by systematic uncertainties which in return can be further constrained using additional data . for an integrated luminosity of 2  @xmath26 ,",
    "a relative precision of @xmath25=10% should be achievable , providing stringent tests to theory predictions .",
    "the ratio of branching fractions r = b(@xmath1 ) / @xmath28 b(@xmath27 ) is constrained within the sm to @xmath29 at 90% cl  @xcite , assuming three fermion generations , unitarity of the ckm matrix and neglect of non-@xmath0 boson decays of the top quark . the most precise measurement to date has been performed by d0 in the lepton+jets channel using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 900  pb@xmath4 by comparing the event yields with 0 , 1 and 2 or more @xmath10-tagged jets .",
    "this measurement obtains the following result for r from a simultaneous fit of r and the @xmath8  cross section ( which is also shown in figure  [ fig : xsec ] ) : r = 0.991@xmath30 this result is in agreement with the sm expectation .",
    "the electric charge of the top quark can be inferred from the electric charges of its decay products .",
    "however , there is an inherent ambiguity when pairing @xmath0 bosons and @xmath10-jets in a top quark pair event resulting in possible charges of @xmath31= 2e/3 or 4e/3 , the latter being predicted in exotic models  @xcite .",
    "d0 has published a first measurement of the electric charge of the top quark excluding the hypothesis of only exotic quarks of charge @xmath31= 4e/3 being produced at 92% cl by analysing lepton+jets events with two identified @xmath10-jets , obtaining the @xmath0 boson charge from the lepton charge , the @xmath10-jet charge from a track - based jet charge algorithm and assigning the @xmath0 boson ",
    "@xmath10-jet pairing based on a kinematic event fit  @xcite .",
    "similarly , cdf obtained a preliminary result on the top quark charge using lepton+jets and dilepton events with an observed @xmath32(bayes factor ) of 12.01 , meaning that the data favour very strongly the sm top quark hypothesis over the exotic model .",
    "top quark decay in the v@xmath34a charged current weak interaction proceeds only via a left - handed ( @xmath35= 30% ) and a longitudinal ( @xmath36=70% ) fraction of @xmath0 boson helicities , which is reflected in the angular distribution of the charged lepton relative to the line of flight of the top quark in the @xmath0 boson rest frame in lepton+jets final states . any observed right - handed fraction @xmath37 would indicate physics beyond the sm .",
    "+ the most precise measurement to date has been performed by cdf using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 fb@xmath4 and comparing the above mentioned angular distribution in data to templates for longitudinal , right- and left - handed signal plus a background template .",
    "when fitting both @xmath36 and @xmath38 simultaneously , the result is @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; constraining @xmath36 respectively @xmath38 to their sm values when fitting @xmath38 respectively @xmath36 , the result is @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , in agreement with expectations from the sm .",
    "the top quark mass is a fundamental sm parameter that is not predicted by the sm theory itself .",
    "it can be used in conjunction with the @xmath0 boson mass to constrain the mass of the still undiscovered higgs boson via radiative corrections .",
    "+ one of the most crucial ingredients for top quark mass measurements is the jet energy scale ( jes ) , relating the measured jet energy to the parton energy .",
    "top events can provide an additional in situ calibration source via hadronic @xmath0 boson decays by using the well - known mass of the @xmath0 boson as a constraint .",
    "additional future constraints on the @xmath10-jes could be derived from the study of @xmath44 decays .",
    "+ the most precise measurements of the top quark mass are achieved in the lepton+jets final state due to the high branching fraction and yet good s / b , the hadronic @xmath0 boson decay allowing for additional jes calibration and the overconstrained event kinematics as only one neutrino is present in the final state .",
    "+ the top quark mass has been measured in all decay modes using different analysis methods that can be roughly separated in two categories : _ template methods _ compare distributions of observables sensitive to the top quark mass in data with template distributions for varying top quark masses .",
    "_ dynamical methods _ try to maximise the use of information in each candidate event by calculating a per - event probability density as a function of the top quark mass , usually based on leading order matrix elements .",
    "+ an example for a dynamical method is the `` matrix element method '' pioneered by d0 in the lepton+jets channel during run  i which yielded the most precise single measurement of that time  @xcite .",
    "it also gives the most precise measurements obtained thus far in run  ii for both cdf and d0 in the lepton+jets channel .",
    "using the measured fraction of signal events , in these measurements the per - event probability is obtained as a linear combination of the signal and background probabilities .",
    "these are evaluated based on leading order matrix elements for the @xmath45 signal and @xmath0+jets main background , also folding in the detector resolution and summing over the different possible jet - parton assignments , solutions for the longitudinal neutrino momentum and possibly @xmath10-tagging event probabilities .",
    "[ fig : topmass ] shows the results of these measurements together with all other measurements considered for the current world average mass of 170.9  @xmath2  1.8  gev  @xcite . by the end of run  ii , a final top quark mass uncertainty of @xmath46  gev should be achievable , which will  together with an improved measurement of the @xmath0 boson mass  provide stringent constraints on the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "following from the current world average top quark mass , the most likely higgs boson mass is @xmath47 gev respectively @xmath48  gev at 95% cl , promising an interesting competition between tevatron and lhc for the first evidence of the higgs boson .",
    "a wealth of top analyses is being pursued at the tevatron , which continue to probe the validity of the sm .",
    "while some measurements are reaching the precision of the theory predictions and thus provide stringent tests thereof , others are still statistically limited , leaving room for physics beyond the sm .",
    "so far , all measurements are in agreement with the sm .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the analyses presented here can be found online  @xcite .",
    "+ continuously improving the analysis methods , and using the increasing integrated luminosity from a smoothly running tevatron , expected to deliver more than 6  fb@xmath4 by the end of run  ii , we are moving towards precision measurements and hopefully discoveries within and outside the sm .",
