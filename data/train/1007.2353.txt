    "in this work a collective of interacting automata in an one - dimensional geometric environment is considered as an integral automata - like computational object .",
    "the problem to define unambiguously what is the state of such dispersed and moving on the environment object and how to measure the amount of state transitions in this case is quite non - trivial . as opposed to the finite state automata where the measure of state transition is one state per unit of discrete time , for a computational dynamic object distributed on the environment different approaches to definition of the measure of state transition are possible .    in this paper",
    "we propose a way for defining what a state is in the context of collective of stateless automata .",
    "it allows us to define it on the basis of the relative positioning of automata , i.e. on the basis of its geometry .",
    "the proposed approach distinguishes two types of states : internal and external states of automata collective .",
    "the measure of state transition of collective of automata , introduced in this paper , we name the proper time of this collective .",
    "the proposed research is inspired by three major research directions which are : 1 ) collective of automata in finite automata theory ; 2 ) discrete models of physical processes and projecting physical world into informational space of symbols and languages for computer modelling of physical world ; 3 ) studying the notion of time .",
    "each of these research directions has an extensive bibliography confirming their importance  @xcite .",
    "the basis for this research is the notion of relativity as given by poincare in his popular works  @xcite .",
    "the concluding comparison of the obtained results with some formulas of special relativity theory shows that the formulated principles are invariant in relation to linguistic means of expression : semantic affinity of the principles ( e.g. , coordinate , velocity , reference frame ) that form the language of our discrete model to the principles of language of special relativity theory resulted in their syntactic affinity ( e.g. , velocity - addition formula , `` length contraction / extension '' formula ) .",
    "the way of forming the language ( velocity , time , reference frame ) of interaction and interpreting this interaction between automata collectives in our model reflects poincare s conventional point of view toward laws of physics .    in order to suggest a physical analogy for this model we use the word `` body '' as alias for `` collective of automata '' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section  [ body ]",
    "we define the model of collective of automata .",
    "then in the section  [ state ] we derive the notions of external and internal states of a collective of automata and study their properties connecting such notions as coordinate , spacial velocity , proper time velocity and proper time of collective .",
    "in what follows we use denotations @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the sets of integers and real numbers , respectively . also we denote the domains for the time and space coordinates by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "initially in the model defintion we assume that @xmath2 and @xmath3 coincide with @xmath0 but then we will extend it to @xmath1 .",
    "the general framework of the model , that we use for this study , consists of two main components : an environment @xmath4 that is represented by a graph and a set of stateless automata , which are interacting with the environment and between themselves .    the environment @xmath4 is defined as the infinite directed graph with the set of nodes @xmath5 and the set of edges @xmath6 . an edge @xmath7 for some @xmath8 has the absolute coordinate @xmath9 and the direction @xmath10 .",
    "absolute coordinate of an edge @xmath11 will be denoted by @xmath12 and its direction by @xmath13 . also the edge @xmath11 will be denoted by @xmath14 . by the neighborhood of an edge @xmath15",
    "we understand the pair of edges @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the edges @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be called opposite edges and @xmath15 and @xmath17",
    "will be called contrary edges .",
    "stateless automata on the environment we name as elementary bodies . in the general framework",
    "we assume that elementary bodies are coloured in a way that isomorphic automata will have the same colour and non - isomorphic automata will have different colours .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 different numbered from @xmath19 to @xmath18 colours are used .",
    "every moment of time @xmath20 any elementary body @xmath21 is located on an edge @xmath22 of the graph @xmath4 .    the input for an elementary body , located on an edge @xmath15 , is the sequence @xmath23 called the neighbourhood state of the edge @xmath15 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the numbers of elementary bodies of the colour @xmath26 , located on the edges @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the same moment of time , respectively .",
    "the output of an elementary body is one of the two motions either the straight - line motion or the turn .",
    "if the output of an elementary body @xmath21 at a time moment @xmath27 on an edge @xmath28 is the straight - line motion , then at the next time moment @xmath29 and we say that it does not change its external state . if the output is the turn then @xmath30 and we say that the elementary body changes its external state . denoting by @xmath31 the number of external state changes of @xmath21 until the moment of time @xmath20 we have that @xmath32 and also @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the path covered by @xmath21 during the period of time @xmath20 .",
    "in other words any elementary body uses the absolute time unit either for one spatial coordinate change in the environment or for one external state transition .",
    "we call @xmath35 the proper time of @xmath21 and @xmath36 the proper time velocity of @xmath21 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath37 .",
    "we call @xmath38 the absolute coordinate of @xmath21 at the moment of time @xmath20 .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 the absolute spatial velocity of @xmath21 at the moment of time @xmath20 .",
    "we call it uniform spatial velocity if @xmath40 is a constant . for example",
    ", it follows from above definitions that any elementary body can have only one of the following uniform spatial velocities : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .    the only state of a stateless automaton ( i.e. of elementary body ) we call the internal state . an elementary body is unambiguously defined by the set of input symbols that change its external state . in additional",
    "we assume also that elementary body can not change its external state anyway if its opposite edge is empty .",
    "we call the pair of a space coordinate @xmath44 and a time coordinate @xmath20 as coordinate in the absolute reference frame @xmath45 and denote by the column vector .",
    "we call @xmath46 also the event space .",
    "we define the discrete world line of @xmath21 in the event space from a time @xmath47 to @xmath48 as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "a body is an arbitrary finite set of elementary bodies .",
    "according to the defintion different bodies may have common parts and one body can contain another body as a subset .",
    "if an elementary body belongs to a body then we will look at it as an elementary part of this body . an elementary body can be an elementary part of different bodies simultaneously .",
    "the following two examples illustrate some of introduced definitions .",
    "any elementary body in both examples changes its external state if and only if its opposite edge is not empty . from it",
    "follows that all elemantary bodies are isomorphic .",
    "we assume that all elementary bodies in each example are enumerated by integer numbers .",
    "[ example1 ] at time @xmath52 for each @xmath53 the elementary body with the number @xmath44 is located on the edge @xmath54 if @xmath44 is even number and @xmath55 otherwise .",
    "we define the body @xmath56 as the set @xmath57 of elementary bodies @xmath58 , @xmath19 and @xmath59 .    ]    [ example2 ] at time @xmath52 for each @xmath53 the elementary body with the number @xmath44 has the coordinate @xmath60 and located on the edge with the direction @xmath61 if @xmath62 and on the edge with the direction @xmath63 otherwise . in this example we define the body @xmath64 .",
    "let a body @xmath65 consist of @xmath66 elementary bodies enumerated by numbers @xmath67 .",
    "then the absolute ( average ) coordinate of the body @xmath65 at time @xmath20 is the value @xmath68 and absolute spatial velocity of the body @xmath65 at time @xmath20 is the value @xmath69 . the bodies @xmath56 and @xmath70 from the above examples have uniform spatial velocities @xmath58 and @xmath71 , respectively . from the definitions it follows that the maximal possible positive or negative spatial velocities of any body can be @xmath19 or @xmath61 .",
    "since the coordinate values of a body can be non - integers let us extend the absolute reference frame @xmath46 from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath75 then we say that an elementary body @xmath21 at time @xmath76 has the coordinate @xmath77 and is located on the edge @xmath78 .",
    "now we can define the ( continues ) world line @xmath79 of an elementary body @xmath21 in time interval from @xmath47 to @xmath48 as the extension of its discrete positions in the event space : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath79 is a straight line segment in the event space then the vector @xmath82 can have only the direction either of the vector @xmath83 or of the vector @xmath84 and we say that the @xmath79 corresponds to _ an elementary move _ of @xmath21 .",
    "in this section we define what does it mean that two bodies are in the same external or internal state , rather than what the external or internal state of a body in fact is .",
    "if needed the notion of state can be in generally defined as follows .",
    "since the relation `` to be in the same external state '' is an equivalence relation , the external states can be defined as equivalence classes of this relation .",
    "the same holds for the definition of internal state .",
    "a body interacting with other bodies exert influence on them and at the same time is also under their influence .",
    "it is quite natural to describe such influences on the basis of the notion of a state of a body .",
    "our definition of a state of a body takes into consideration the relative positioning of its elementary parts in the environment .",
    "the changes of relative positioning of elementary parts in a body can affect the body entirely or a particular part of it .",
    "this motivates the question how to measure the amount of state transition . before the definition of the notion of a state we introduce the denotation for the measure @xmath85 of state transition of a body @xmath65 with the flow of time @xmath20 .",
    "a casual meaning of @xmath85 is the `` age '' of the body @xmath65 at the moment @xmath20 .",
    "we call @xmath85 the proper time of @xmath65 .    independently from the definition of @xmath85 , we introduce the velocity @xmath86 of state transition of the body @xmath65 as @xmath87 .",
    "we call this value as the proper time velocity of @xmath65 at the moment of the absolute time @xmath20 .    for any body",
    "@xmath65 @xmath88    for any body @xmath65",
    "@xmath89    from it follows that a body @xmath65 does not change its external state if all its elementary bodies do not change their external states .",
    "it means that two bodies are at the same external state if one can be transformed into another by isometric straight - line shifts in the environment applied to all its elementary parts .    for any body @xmath65 , if @xmath90 then @xmath91 .",
    "the statement follows from the fact that any change of the external state of a body is not possible in case of maximal spatial velocity of all its elementary parts .",
    "the notion of external state of a body allows to consider the bodies as an automata - like model of algorithms .",
    "but since two bodies with different absolute spatial velocities are definitely in different external states we can not speak of them as of realization of the same algorithm .",
    "for example there is no sense to `` ask '' a body to determine its absolute spatial velocity .",
    "however we would like to identify two bodies as the same algorithm even if they move with different spatial velocities .",
    "it will be achieved by introduction of affine isomorphism of bodies through definition of inertial reference frame associated with a body so that the external state of a body will be presented as pair of components : spatial velocity of the body and its internal state that is spatial velocity invariant .",
    "the point of introducing the notion of inertial reference frame associated with a body lies in the ability to consider other bodies in relation to the given one .",
    "an example of inertial reference frame is the absolute reference frame @xmath46 associated with an immovable body @xmath65 such that for all @xmath27 @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and , hence , @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the introduced notions of absolute time , absolute coordinate and absolute spatial velocity implicitly mean an absolutely motionless body in relation to which objects were considered .",
    "the reference frames associated with the bodies allow us to make these notions relative .",
    "let us denote ( for a pair of bodies @xmath97 and @xmath65 ) by @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 the coordinate , the spatial velocity , the proper time velocity and the proper time of the body @xmath97 at the moment of time @xmath102 in the reference frame @xmath103 associated with the body @xmath65 , respectively . by definition",
    "we assume that @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "a body @xmath65 is called an inertial body if @xmath108 and @xmath86 are both constants .",
    "[ rem1 ] it follows that @xmath109 and @xmath110 for inertial bodies @xmath97 and @xmath65 .",
    "further we consider only inertial bodies .",
    "in addition we assume that coordinates of the same events in different inertial reference frames are connected by affine mapping . for any bodies @xmath97 and @xmath65 let us denote by @xmath111 the affine mapping that connects @xmath103 and @xmath112 such that an event @xmath113 in @xmath103 coincides with the event @xmath114 in @xmath112 .",
    "these assumptions are sufficient to find out @xmath115 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the origins of both reference frames @xmath112 and @xmath103 are the same : @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "then the mapping @xmath115 is linear .",
    "let us work out the form of transformation matrix @xmath118 .",
    "[ lemma_lba ] the mapping @xmath115 either holds the directions of the vectors @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( i.e. these vectors are eigenvectors of the mapping @xmath115 ) or permutes their directions .",
    "the directions of reference frame axes are imaginary directions in the event space .",
    "but the set of directions of the vectors @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the absolute reference frame corresponds to the directions of the `` real '' `` material '' world lines of elementary bodies by elementary moves and therefore this set of directions does not depend on reference frames . from it",
    "follows that this set of directions _ is invariant _ by any affine transformation .    for the matrix",
    "@xmath115 holds either @xmath121 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "based on the lemma  [ lemma_lba ] the corollary statement follows as a result of straightforward calculations .",
    "if @xmath121 and @xmath122 holds , then the reference frames @xmath112 and @xmath103 are said to be in standard configuration .",
    "if @xmath123 and @xmath124 holds , then the reference frames @xmath112 and @xmath103 are said to be in symmetric configuration .",
    "[ theorem1 ] in the standard configuration the following holds @xmath125    since @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , then @xmath130 . from",
    "it follows that @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    in the symmetric configuration the following holds @xmath133",
    "a proof is analogous to that of theorem  [ theorem1 ] .",
    "let @xmath134 . by symmetric configuration the space axis of the reference frames @xmath112 and @xmath103 are in opposite directions , by standard configurations they are in the same directions .",
    "further for the sake of convenience we consider reference frames only in the standard configuration .",
    "the following corollaries hold for any intertial bodies @xmath97 , @xmath65 , @xmath135 .",
    "[ cor3 ] it holds @xmath136 and @xmath137    the equalities can be derived from @xmath138 .",

    "let @xmath143 be the distance between @xmath97 and @xmath65 in the reference frame @xmath144 , then @xmath145 .     and",
    "@xmath65 in corollary  [ corollary1 ] ]    notice that the values of @xmath146 and @xmath147 are constants . without loss of generality",
    "we assume @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 . then @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "let @xmath154 be such a moment of time that the events @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the same .",
    "then the formula @xmath145 of `` length contraction '' follows from @xmath157 and theorem  [ theorem1 ] .",
    "as it will be seen , from the example at the end of this section , @xmath158 may take on a value which is less than 1 as well as more than 1 .",
    "so it means that in our discrete model we have contracting length as well as extending length in respect to different inertial frame system .",
    "now we give a definition of internal state of a body .",
    "let for bodies @xmath97 and @xmath65 there be a bijection @xmath159 such that for all @xmath160 elementary bodies @xmath21 and @xmath161 are isomorphic .",
    "we say that @xmath97 at the moment of proper time @xmath154 and @xmath65 at the moment of proper time @xmath162 are affine isomorphic iff @xmath163=@xmath164 .",
    "two inertial bodies are in the same internal state at some moments of their proper time iff they are affine isomorphic at their respective proper time .    internal state of an inertial body",
    "does not depend on its spatial velocity in the absolute reference frame .",
    "thus , the external state of an inertial body can be seen as a combination of two components : the spatial velocity of the body and its internal state .    in order to illustrate the concept of affine isomorphism",
    "let us consider bodies @xmath56 and @xmath70 from the examples  [ example1 ] and  [ example2 ] .",
    "this bodies are affine isomorphic .",
    "the corresponding transformation of the reference frame @xmath165 of @xmath70 to @xmath166 of @xmath56 is :    @xmath167    the dynamics of the bodies and illustration of the transformation are shown on the figure  [ f_ex2 ] . from the value of transformation matrix and corollary  [ cor3 ]",
    "it follows that @xmath168 @xmath169 , @xmath170 .     and  [ example2 ] .",
    "let us compare the obtained results with formulas of special relativity theory .",
    "it is interesting to have a look , from our model viewpoint , at two equations @xmath171 of time dilation and @xmath172 of length contraction of the special relativity theory . drawing a proper analogy between them and @xmath173 ( remark  [ rem1 ] ) and @xmath145 ( corollary  [ corollary1 ] )",
    "respectively we can see , due to generally asymmetry @xmath174 in our discrete virtual `` world '' , that the coefficient @xmath175 reciprocal to lorentz factor @xmath176 has different `` physical '' meanings in these formulas .",
    "the factor @xmath177 has in the first equations a meaning of the coefficient @xmath178 and in the second equations has a meaning of the coefficient @xmath158 if we consider a `` moving '' @xmath97 with respect to a `` rest '' @xmath135 .",
    "we would like to position this paper as an introductory research work on fundamental notion of a state for distributed automata object and to draw attention to the number of problems related to such notion .",
    "it is shown that a measure of state transition of such object can be described by the language of internal and external state changes .",
    "we hope that the proposed analogies between automata theory and relativity theory can generate further interest to the topic towards a better understanding of such analogy .",
    "apart from the study of the notion of state somebody can ask a number of more technical questions which were not intention of this work , but nevertheless are important research issues .",
    "in particular , it was not considered what kind of values the transformation matrix of @xmath179 basically can have .",
    "also the algorithmic universality of model is not proved , though a proof of this fact simply enough by simulation of cellular automata .",
    "it will be interesting to consider the model in higher dimensions and the case of not inertial bodies and inhomogeneous environment . at the same time various problems are unsolvable in the given model because of peculiarity of the model , e.g. like the question whether a body can define its absolute velocity .",
    "this seemingly natural question is meaningless in the considered model and therefore is an algorithmically unsolvable problem in it .",
