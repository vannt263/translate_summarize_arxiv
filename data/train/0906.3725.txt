    "the terminology used in the main paper arises from the foundations of quantum mechanics and has more recently become important in the field of quantum information ( qi ) .",
    "thus we describe the avian compass and its dynamics in terms of quantum coherence , environmental decoherence , and entanglement ; moreover we use the quantum master equation technique to model the system s dynamics . these terms and techniques",
    "are rather different to those of the established radical pair ( rp ) and avian compass communities , therefore it is appropriate to justify their use and relate them to the established terminology .",
    "the primary conclusion of the paper concerns the extent to which quantum coherence is protected in the compass system . by this term",
    ", we refer to the _ purity _ of the system , which is degraded by interactions with the environment because these will generally act as a kind of measurement of the state ( for example , by taking a quantum of energy from the state and thus leaving it in a specific low - energy state ) .",
    "since the ` outcome ' of this measurement is lost to the environment , the system s state becomes a _ mixture _ of the multiple possible states  generically this loss of purity is called decoherence .    in the applied qi field ,",
    "much effort is dedicated to the preservation of quantum coherence . in order for quantum coherence to be maintained , it is essential to prevent all kinds of interaction , including those that would _ flip _ spins , allowing them to relax and lose energy , and also those interactions which would merely alter the _ phase _ relationships in the state ( dephasing noise ) .",
    "thus while the concept of _ spin relaxation _ is a typical signature of general coupling to the environment , we must also examine the effect of pure phase noise ; the latter alone can suffice to completely degrade a pure state such as the singlet @xmath59 into a completely incoherent mixture of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and would therefore undermine our conclusion . in order to examine this point , and establish whether full coherence is indeed maintained ,",
    "it is necessary to construct a equation for the dynamics of the system where pure phase noise alone occurs .",
    "this is most naturally done with the quantum master equation ( qme ) formalism and the corresponding lindblad noise operators  however , it is important to note ( as mentioned in the main paper ) that the qme is actually identical to the more conventional liouville equation in the case of zero environmental noise .",
    "we select the qme as the most suitable tool for examining specific decoherence models , including both general spin relaxation and those that specifically cause only dephasing .",
    "finally we note that , because the rp involves two electrons , and these are spatially separated , it is meaningful to use the quantity ` entanglement ' as one specific characterization of their mutual state .",
    "the established avian compass literature would tend to refer to the related concept of _ spin correlation _",
    ", however , entanglement is subtly and importantly different in that it captures precisely the non - classical correlations between spins ",
    "it is impossible , for example , to create entanglement between two sites simply by exchanging classical information as to how the spins should be prepared .",
    "we chose to plot the entanglement in the avian compass because it is a key quantity ( arguably , _",
    "the _ essential quantity ) in the quantum mechanics , and therefore a reader from that community will naturally wonder about this aspect .",
    "however , we find that while entanglement does persist for a remarkably long time , this is likely to be merely an implication of the long coherence time rather than a key property of the compass mechanism .",
    "interestingly , if we begin the simulation with a completely dephased state : @xmath56 , the classical correlations are still sufficient for achieving adequate angular visibility and neither quantum phase coherence nor entanglement seems to be a prerequisite for the efficiency of the avian compass .",
    "to explore this idea further , we would like to study ` pure dephasing ' occurring _ during _ the singlet - triplet interconversion .",
    "in essence we use energy conserving noise operators , eqn .",
    "( [ dephase ] ) , which are known to be the dominant source of decoherence in so many other artificially made quantum systems . by applying this specific noise",
    ", we confirm that the compass mechanism s performance is essentially immune , while of course the coherence of the quantum state of the electrons would be degraded .",
    "one might be inclined to conclude that , if pure dephasing noise is indeed dominant , then the avian compass need not protect quantum coherence for the long time scales suggested in the main paper . but",
    "crucially , we also show that if such noise were naturally present at a high level in the compass ( exceeding the generic noise level @xmath49 by more than an order of magnitude ) then it would render the bird immune to the weak oscillatory magnetic fields studied by ritz _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "thus the sensitivity to oscillatory fields implies that both amplitude and phase , and thus entanglement , are indeed protected within the avian compass on timescales exceeding tens of microseconds .",
    "since the electron spin singlet state is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , the dephasing operators will be different from the ones mixing the phase of the singlet and triplet state within the electronic subspace .",
    "instead , we replace the previously defined noise operators of @xmath61 of eq .",
    "( 3 ) by appropriate dephasing operators as follows : we treat the remote electron and the eletron nuclear spin subsystem separately . within both subsystems , we define dephasing operators @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the set of normalised eigenvectors of this subsystem .",
    "this results in two dephasing operators for the remote electron ( these can be combined to a single @xmath64 operator rotated with the field ) and four operators for the eletron nuclear spin subsystem .",
    "each of these dephasing operators corresponds to fluctuations of one of the ( subsystem s ) energy levels .",
    "strikingly , the singlet yield is entirely unaffected by this particular kind of noise , i.e. it is entirely independent of the dephasing rate @xmath65 .",
    "thus , a curve obtained with this model coincides perfectly with the reference curve of fig .",
    "3 of the main paper .",
    "however , we show in the following that the dephasing rate of this model can be at most ten times faster than the generic noise rate to retain sensitivity to the oscillatory field .     in the presence of the oscillatory field for different pure dephasing rates",
    "this is to be compared with the @xmath66 line in fig",
    ". 2 of the main paper . see text for an explanation . ]",
    "[ fig : dephasingandfield ] shows the singlet yield as a function of @xmath67 for different pure dephasing rates @xmath65 .",
    "pure phase noise would actually _ protect _ the compass from the harmful effect of an applied oscillatory field ( by suppressing the rabi oscillations caused by such a field ) .",
    "we see that an aggressive pure dephasing rate of @xmath68 almost completely recovers the reference curve ( corresponding to a noise - free system without oscillatory field ) .",
    "european robins can adjust to different strengths of the magnetic field .",
    "this implies , that their chemical compass can not depend on the absolute value of the the electron spins hyperfine ( hf ) coupling .",
    "we here argue that the conclusion presented in the main paper is not only robust against variations in the field strength , but also does not depend on the specifics of the anisotropic interaction between electron 1 and its local environment .",
    "( of the two electrons constituing the rp , only one of them can be significantly coupled to nuclear spin(s ) because the resonance effect  @xcite occurs at exactly the frequency of the zeeman splitting of an _ unperturbed _ electron . )",
    "we have explicitly checked that our conclusions do not rely on the specifics of the hf tensor given in the main text . specifically neither a weaker or stronger coupling , nor a different hf tensor symmetry changes our observations about the shortest time scale required for the process to be sensitive to the oscillatory field .",
    "neither do these factors change the maximal tolerable environmental noise rates to maintain a pronounced signal contrast .    here",
    "we describe one of the variants we have studied : a ` disc - shaped ' hf - coupling tensor with coupling strengths that are different from the ones presented in the main paper .",
    "the largest coupling here is half as strong as the one presented in the text : @xmath69 .",
    "[ fig : pancakeplots ] shows that we obtain exactly the same qualitative behaviour as for the parameters used in the main text , the only difference being in the different shape of the singlet yield curve ( as expected for a different geometry of hf tensor ) .",
    "the oscillatory field does not have an influence on the singlet yield for @xmath70 , while a noise rate of @xmath37 leads to a dramatic reduction of contrast .          instead of coupling to nuclear spin(s ) , an anisotropic g - factor for one of the electrons could also lead to a singlet yield with an angular dependence  @xcite .",
    "we here show that our main conclusion remains valid under this different hamiltonian of the rp .    for illustration purposes ,",
    "we consider a prounounced anisotropy : the g - factor in @xmath71-direction is @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 of the free electronic g - factor of @xmath11 , while in @xmath74 and @xmath75-direction we have @xmath76 . a smaller anisotropy works as well , but gives less overall signal contrast ( even in the unperturbed ) scenario .",
    "we present results for these parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfactor ] , confirming that the qualitative behaviour is still the same under these assumptions .",
    "the noise model we employ is markovian , implying that the information lost to the environment will not return to the system ( as it would , wholly or partially , if the environment was entirely constituted by other isolated qubits that could effectively act as a memory ) .",
    "this markovian assumption is the natural choice to make for a room temperature system whose detailed structure and environmental interactions are unknown .",
    "one can immediately think of ` likely suspects ' for decoherence in the present system that would be markovian : for example , modulation in the electron - electron separation due to vibrations in the supporting matrix .",
    "but more importantly , while one can reasonably speculate that there may _ also _ be non - markovian processes occuring , between the core system and other degrees of freedom that are well isolated from the true ` bath ' degrees of freedom , this does not undermine our result .",
    "in essence , one would ` draw a dotted line ' around the larger system , comprised of the core electron pair _ together _ with the non - markovian environment , calling _ that _ the avian compass ( although noting that only the core part plays an active role ) .",
    "one would conclude that this larger system is , again , remarkably well insulated from the environment .",
    "in the model described in the main paper , there is a single nuclear spin coupled to one of the electrons .",
    "however , previous publications have studied the case where more than one nuclear spin is present  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to check whether the addition of a nuclear spin will alter our conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian now gains an additional coupling term , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the hf tensor of the main text and @xmath79 .",
    "here we choose a second rugby shaped hf tensor oriented parallel to the first . note that we have also considered different relative coupling strengths and geometries ( such as a pancake shaped and rugby shaped tensor ) , but again , these choices do not influence our core conclusions .",
    "results for the particular choice of parameters described above are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2nuclei ] .",
    "in the first stage of the argument in the main paper , we show how the bird s sensitivity to field angle is degraded by an applied oscillatory field ( fig .",
    "2 , main paper ) .",
    "there we set the environmental noise operators to zero  this is of course unrealistic , and one might worry that finite noise could ultimately lead to less dramatic conclusions regarding protection of quantum coherence .",
    "however , here we show that the reverse is true : the addition of finite noise leads to a suppression of the harmful effect of the oscillatory field , and thus would lead one to infer a still more dramatic coherence time .",
    "therefore , by setting the noise to zero we make the more conservative assumption .",
    "we confirm this by employing the following master equation ( which is exactly eq .",
    "( 3 ) of the main paper ) , while at the same time applying the oscillatory field : @xmath80   +   k \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^8",
    "p_i \\rho p_i^{\\dagger }    - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( p_i^{\\dagger } p_i \\rho + \\rho   p_i^{\\dagger } p_i",
    "\\right ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\gamma_i \\left (   l_i \\rho l_i^{\\dagger }    - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( l_i^{\\dagger } l_i \\rho + \\rho   l_i^{\\dagger } l_i \\right ) \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : fullme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : noiseandfield ] corresponds to fig .",
    "2 of the main paper with such _ additionally _ applied noise at a rate of @xmath81 .",
    "note that the noise rate is adjusted with @xmath30 , as we wish to concentrate on the combined effect of the oscillatory field and ` mild noise ' over the timescale of the process .",
    "we infer that the singlet yield contrast is only significantly reduced when @xmath82 , meaning the addition of noise to fig . 2 in the main paper does not influence our conclusion .",
    "to establish that this conclusion is robust with respect to the particular choice of @xmath81 , we now investigate _ different _ noise rates for a fixed value of @xmath83 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : noiseandfield ] , we show a pair of curves for each noise rate : one obtained with and one without the oscillatory field .",
    "we make two observations : firstly , the two curves of each pair nearly coincide , indicating that there is only a small sensitivity to the oscillatory field indepedent of the noise rate .",
    "secondly , the sensitivity _ decreases _ even more when the system is subjected to more aggressive noise .",
    "in fact , this second observation is not surprising : we would not expect the additional noise terms to lead to a greater sensitivity to the oscillatory field .",
    "the singlet yield signal is corrupted by spin flips of the remote electron in the presence of the oscillatory field , which essentially causes the spin to rabi flop , thus requiring quantum coherence .",
    "therefore , any noise acting on the remote electron will decohere the spin and thus suppress rather than enhance the effect of the oscillatory field .",
    "this can also be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : noiseandfield ] : the red curves are very similar but not quite identical , the agreement is better for the green curves and almost perfect for the blue one .",

    "<S> thus the sensitivity to oscillatory fields implies that both amplitude and phase , and thus entanglement , are indeed protected within the avian compass on timescales exceeding tens of microseconds . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear _ why _ such remarkable protection occurs , but given the widely - accepted rp model together with the recent experimental data  @xcite , this conclusion follows .    </S>",
