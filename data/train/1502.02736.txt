    "starting with the question of whether the excited - state lifetime of an atom can be modified , physicists have continuously explored ways to engineer the radiative properties of quantum emitters .",
    "the first experimental studies were performed in the near field of flat interfaces @xcite , but the change of spontaneous emission is commonly associated with purcell s prediction that a cavity of quality factor @xmath2 and mode volume @xmath3 can accelerate the radiation of a dipolar transition by @xmath4 folds , where @xmath5 is the wavelength in the corresponding medium @xcite . following this recipe ,",
    "many clever resonator schemes such as high - q open fabry - prot cavities ( fpc ) , monolithic fpcs in form of pillars , whispering gallery mode resonators and photonic crystal structures have been investigated for realizing large purcell factors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , sizable modifications of the spontaneous emission process remain nontrivial because no cavity design has succeeded in providing all the decisive ingredients of large @xmath2 , small @xmath3 ( ideally down to its fundamental value of the order of @xmath6 ) , a facile way of tuning the cavity resonance , and compatibility with emitters of different materials . of the various cavity geometries ,",
    "open fpcs remain particularly attractive because they nicely lend themselves to the latter two criteria .",
    "efforts using open fpcs have usually pursued large @xmath7 via high @xmath2s instead of low @xmath3 , but this choice is accompanied by several disadvantages .",
    "first , the resulting narrow cavity linewidths make the cavity extremely sensitive to mechanically , thermally or stress - induced length changes .",
    "second , broad transitions in the condensed phase can not couple to very narrow cavity resonances in an efficient manner .",
    "this is especially a restriction for room - temperature studies , where homogeneous linewidths of quantum dots , molecules or ions can reach several nanometers .",
    "in addition , scattering from finite - sized particles , e.g. from diamond nanocrystals , could quickly spoil the high q of the cavity .",
    "furthermore , narrow cavity resonances do not allow simultaneous coupling to different transitions , for instance , for studies of @xmath8 transitions or of nonlinear interactions involving several light beams  @xcite .    in this article , we explore a new cavity design using a micromirror with a radius of curvature as small as 2.6  @xmath9 fabricated on a cantilever . by realizing a microcavity with a sub-@xmath0 volume and low @xmath2",
    ", we obtain a sizable @xmath7 that would lead to the modification of the spontaneous emission rate by more than one order of magnitude while keeping a spectral bandwidth as broad as 1 thz .",
    "the second novel feature of our arrangement is the compatibility of its high numerical aperture ( @xmath10 ) with the recent advances in efficient atom - photon coupling via tight focusing  @xcite .",
    "third , the open character , scanning capability and low q of our fpc provide the possibility of using it as a scanning microscope  @xcite , which can be used for local field - enhanced spectroscopy  @xcite and sensing  @xcite of very different materials such as semiconductor quantum dots , carbon nanotubes , organic molecules , rare earth ions , and biomolecules . in particular , the low q of the cavity ensures that even broad resonances of these materials couple efficiently to the cavity modes at room temperature .",
    "fourth , the cantilever - based feature of our experimental arrangement makes it highly interesting for an unexplored regime of optomechanical investigations  @xcite as we discuss in the concluding paragraph of this article .",
    "the inset in fig .  [ setup](a ) shows the schematics of our cavity made of a flat distributed bragg reflector ( dbr ) and a micromirror fabricated by focused ion beam milling . here , we started with an n - doped silicon cantilever that contained a pedestal ( diameter 8 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the area of the micromirror to be milled was divided into pixels of diameter 5 nm . by controlling the ion dose for each pixel",
    ", we obtained a spherical surface profile , which was then polished in a final step .",
    "figure  [ setup](b ) displays an electron microscope image of a cantilever pedestal with four mirrors of different radii of curvature , and fig .",

    ", the mirror has a radius of curvature of @xmath11 accompanied by a root - mean - square surface roughness below 5 nm .",
    "an opening aperture diameter of 2.4 @xmath9 provides a concave mirror with numerical aperture @xmath12 following the standard defintion of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the angle subtended by half the mirror aperture and @xmath15 is the mirror focal length .",
    "we note that fabrication of micromirrors has been previously reported for wet etching  @xcite , laser ablation  @xcite and focused ion beam milling  @xcite , but the majority of the existing works report radii of curvature above ten microns , limiting both @xmath10 and @xmath3 . to our knowledge",
    ", we provide the highest numerical aperture for a tunable microcavity reported to date .",
    "the micromirrors were coated with 150 nm of gold followed by 50 nm of silicon dioxide as a protective layer , yielding a nominal reflectivity of 96% at @xmath16 nm .",
    "taking into account the slight roughness of this mirror ( see figure  [ setup](c ) ) , we expect the reflectivity to be reduced to 95% due to residual scattering  @xcite .",
    "the dbr consisted of 11 layers of @xmath17 stacks finished by a 22 nm layer of @xmath18 to place the field maximum at the mirror surface .",
    "the resulting structure had a total thickness of 2.14 @xmath9 with its design band center at 710 nm and a band edge at 841 nm , leading to reflectivities of 99.9% at @xmath16 nm and 99.99% at 745 nm .",
    "as displayed in fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) , the microcavity was assembled with a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) stack for the axial displacement of the cantilever and a pzt scanner for the lateral positioning of the dbr .",
    "we point out that the asymmetry of the mirror reflectivities causes a suboptimal impedance matching , which can be easily alleviated by using lower reflectivity dbr . in this work , however , we have not been concerned with coupling efficiencies .    intuitively speaking ,",
    "we want to operate the cavity close to the condition , where the rays from a strongly focused incident beam are retroreflected by the curved micromirror .",
    "it follows that a useful figure of merit for mode matching becomes the opening arc half - angle @xmath19 subtended by the mirror aperture ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) ) .",
    "we , thus , define @xmath20 as an effective numerical aperture , which amounts to 0.46 in our experiment .",
    "we note in passing that according to common textbook knowledge , the stability of a plane - concave fpc becomes compromised as the cavity length becomes comparable to and larger than the mirror curvature  @xcite .      to perform spectroscopy on the microcavity , we focused laser beams at @xmath5=785 nm and @xmath5=745 nm through a microscope objective with @xmath21 , whereby the waist of the incident laser beam was adjusted to match @xmath22 .",
    "we then scanned the axial position of the cantilever and monitored the reflected light on a photodiode .     for various @xmath23 modes .",

    "( [ eq : airy ] ) , one obtains @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the geometric mean of the two mirror reflectivities .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : airy ] ) provides an expression for the spectrum of the cavity .",
    "however , in the laboratory one does not have an easy access to the phase of the light field .",
    "instead , one either scans the frequency @xmath46 of the incident beam at a fixed @xmath25 or changes the latter at a fixed frequency . in most textbook treatments of fabry - prots , thin planar mirrors are considered , and the dependence of @xmath37 , @xmath47 and @xmath36 on @xmath25 and @xmath46 is neglected . in that case , since only the propagation phase @xmath48 changes , the spectra can be plotted as a function of @xmath25 or @xmath46 in a fully equivalent fashion , leading to @xmath49 .",
    "here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the separation of two adjacent resonance lengths and frequencies ( commonly known as the free spectral range ) , respectively , whereas @xmath52 and @xmath53 signify the fwhm of the corresponding resonance as the cavity length or frequency are varied .",
    "this relation then allows a direct conversion of data obtained from cavity length spectroscopy to the properties of the frequency spectrum .",
    "we now allow @xmath37 , @xmath47 and @xmath36 to depend on @xmath25 and @xmath46 .",

    "another potential use of our cavity concept is for the achievement of few - photon nonlinear effects on single quantum emitters  @xcite .",
    "examples of such an effect are three - photon mixing , stimulated rayleigh scattering and hyper - raman scattering  @xcite . while there have been a few reports of direct cavity - free optical nonlinear studies on single molecules and quantum dots  @xcite , enhancements of the optical field in the cavity and of the radiation of a quantum emitter into its mode can boost these effects further .",
    "here , a large cavity bandwidth is of crucial importance since simultaneous coupling to several wavelengths would be otherwise not possible .",
    "the broad resonance of a microcavity is also a great asset for studying cooperative effect among many quantum emitters with slightly different resonance frequencies or with large homogeneous lines as it occurs in solid - state systems .",
    "an example of such phenomena concerns rabi splittings and coupling to polaritonic states at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "although the coupling of each individual molecule or exciton is negligible in these systems , strong rabi splitting are observed when a large number of emitters join efforts .",
    "the combination of a large cooperativity , small @xmath3 and low @xmath2 would allow one to examine polaritonic physics with far fewer emitters than previously accessible both at room temperature and at cryogenic conditions .",
    "a further practical advantage of a considerable cooperativity factor combined with a low @xmath2 is that the experimental setup becomes much less sensitive to mechanical instabilities .",
    "this is particularly helpful for experiments in high vacuum or in cryostats , where vibrations are omnipresent .",
    "indeed , the arrangement of the cavity presented here could be highly interesting for use in atom  @xcite and nanoparticle trapping  @xcite , especially for on - chip schemes  @xcite .",
    "for example , the antinode in fig .",
    "[ volume - cuts](a ) is ideally suited for this purpose , keeping the particle sufficiently far from mirror surfaces to avoid van der waals forces  @xcite .",
    "the cantilever - based nature of our experimental arrangement also holds great promise in the context of optomechanics .",
    "let us consider a silicon cantilever of thickness 0.7 @xmath9 , length 10 @xmath9 and width 5 @xmath9 , yielding a mechanical oscillation frequency of about 5 mhz and mass of @xmath118  kg .",
    "a micromirror on such a cantilever forming a cavity length @xmath119 would result in a nearly maximal field per photon @xmath120 and an optomechanical coupling strength between the photon and a single phonon of @xmath121  hz , which is comparable with the best reported values @xcite .",
    "for these experiments , a higher q would further improve the cavity performance . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "these can be readily increased by using dielectric coatings instead of gold . to respect the small radius of curvature of the micromirror",
    ", one would use materials with strong dielectric contrasts to reduce the number of the necessary bragg layers .",
    "other applications of the work presented here are in optical sensing and analytics . over the past decades ,",
    "a large body of literature has been devoted to the use of optical micro- and nanostructures such as waveguides , cavities and plasmonic nanoantennas for detecting small traces of biological matter  @xcite .",
    "the existing works on microcavity sensing use fairly large mode volumes and require , therefore , high @xmath2s to reach sufficient sensitivity .",
    "recently , we demonstrated that single small proteins can be detected via their direct scattering in a label - free fashion if only diffraction - limited imaging is implemented  @xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", we have shown that the scattering cross section of a protein , as small as it is , is large enough to extinguish a measurable amount of power from a laser beam .",
    "if one now maintains a tight focus and circulates the laser beam in a cavity to allow for repeated interactions with the analyte species , one directly wins in the detection sensitivity by @xmath122 folds . based on a similar argument",
    ", our tunable and scannable microcavity can also find applications in raman microscopy , where small cross sections would be compensated by larger excitation intensities .",
    "again , a large cavity bandwidth is essential to allow a simultaneous coupling of the excitation beam and the raman signal .",
    "the physics of microlasers is another area that would benefit from our cavity design . since its invention more than half a century ago",
    ", there has been a continuous stream of reports on various fundamental aspects of laser physics , for example of lasing with minimal gain or with very small thresholds .",
    "it turns out that again an important figure of merit is given by @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "here , a higher @xmath2 increases the degree of coherence although it also minimizes the overlap between the homogeneous spectrum of the gain medium and the cavity mode , resulting in higher thresholds .",
    "a lower @xmath3 ( and thus a higher finesse ) pushes away the modes to reduce mode competition .",
    "in addition , a large purcell factor ensures a high @xmath123 , which determines the fraction of the overall spontaneous emission funneled in the mode of interest according to @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the regime of our microcavity , simultaneously keeping a low @xmath2 , low @xmath3 and high @xmath7 , has promise in the development of new microlasers , especially in combination with fluidics  @xcite .",
    "aside from their academic interest , low - threshold microlasers are also highly in demand for applications , where miniaturization and scaling play a role .",
