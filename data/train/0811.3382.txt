    "the @xmath0 is a negative parity excited baryon with strangeness @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known that simple constituent quark models have a difficulty in describing the light mass of the @xmath0 , in spite of the successful description of other excited baryons . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 can be reasonably described by the coupled - channel framework of meson - baryon scattering .",
    "these observations have caused a long - standing discussion about its structure .",
    "a recent interest on this particle is related to the @xmath4 interaction below the threshold .",
    "it should be noted that the subthreshold @xmath1 amplitude can not be directly observed in experiments since it is kinematically forbidden . the only way to access this region is given by the spectrum of the coupled - channel @xmath5 , which is largely dominated by the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "therefore the property of the @xmath0 is related to the @xmath4 interaction below threshold , which is an essential building block for the study of kaonic nuclei . here",
    "we report on recent development of chiral su(3 ) dynamics about these issues : the structure of the @xmath0 and its consequence in @xmath1 phenomenology .",
    "we utilize the chiral coupled - channel approach , which describes hadron scatterings and resonances , incorporating two important principles : ( i ) the interaction follows the low energy theorem of chiral symmetry,@xcite and ( ii ) the amplitude should be constrained by the unitarity condition in coupled channels.@xcite in practice , we determine the low energy interaction by the leading order term of chiral perturbation theory : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the coupling strengths , @xmath8 is the meson decay constant , and @xmath9 is the energy of the meson in channel @xmath10 .",
    "the coupled - channel scattering amplitude @xmath11 is given by solving the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the loop function .",
    "applied to the @xmath3 meson - baryon scattering system,@xcite the resulting amplitude well reproduces the experimental data such as total cross sections of @xmath14 scattering , threshold branching ratios , and the invariant mass spectrum in @xmath5 channel .",
    "the framework has been successfully applied also to the @xmath15 sector with nucleon resonances , to mesonic sectors , and to systems including heavy quarks in the target hadrons .",
    "these successes in variety of systems indicate the importance of the above two principles ( i ) and ( ii ) when constructing the hadron scattering amplitude.@xcite",
    "we first analyze the structure by paying attention to the renormalization procedure . based on a general ground of the scattering theory , origin of resonances",
    "can be classified into two categories : dynamical state and castillejo - dalitz - dyson ( cdd ) pole contribution.@xcite the dynamical state is the resonance generated by the two - body interaction , which is regarded as a two - body molecule state .",
    "the cdd pole is considered to be an elementary or independent particle , which has the origin outside the model space of the scattering . in the present case of the @xmath0 ,",
    "the cdd pole contribution would come , for instance , from three - quark state .",
    "the previous studies of the chiral coupled - channel approach have shown that cdd pole contribution is introduced in several ways to the interaction kernel @xmath16 in eq .  .",
    "in a recent work,@xcite it is pointed out that the cdd pole contribution can also exist in the loop function @xmath13 through the renormalization procedure .",
    "it has been explicitly shown that a certain choice of the cutoff parameter introduces the pole term contribution in @xmath16 , even if the cdd pole contribution is not included in the beginning . analyzing the two examples , @xmath17 resonance in @xmath18 scattering and @xmath0 resonance in @xmath4 scattering",
    ", it is found that a substantial cdd pole contribution is required for the @xmath17 on top of the dynamical component , while the @xmath0 is largely dominated by the dynamical component .",
    "next we consider the scaling with respect to the number of colors @xmath19 , which is a powerful tool to investigate the quark structure in hadron effective theory .",
    "the key issue is that , in qcd , the @xmath19 dependences of the hadronic quantities are known from the general argument.@xcite therefore , introducing the @xmath19 dependence into the framework and analyzing the properties of the resonance with respect to @xmath19 , we can extract the information of quark structure of the resonance.@xcite in contrast to the mesonic sector , baryonic sector contains the nontrivial @xmath19 dependence in the leading order wt interaction.@xcite introducing all the @xmath19 dependences in the model , the scattering amplitude is calculated as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "the general argument tells us that if the excited baryon is a three - quark state , the mass is proportional to @xmath19 and the width should be a constant [ @xmath20 .",
    "the result shows that the width of the @xmath0 resonance changes when the @xmath19 is increased.@xcite this is a clear indication of the non-@xmath21 structure of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "finally we study electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 resonance by introducing an external photon field.@xcite because the resonance is expressed by the bubble sum of the meson - baryon loops , the photon field is attached to the constituent mesons and baryons . in order to extract the information of size",
    ", we evaluate the electric mean squared radius by neglecting the decay channels .",
    "the result turns out to be about 2 @xmath22 with negative sign .",
    "this means that the electromagnetic size of this resonance is much larger than the ground state nucleon , which is mainly composed of three - quark state .",
    "hence the result is consistent with the picture of the @xmath0 that the @xmath23 is widely spread around the proton .    to summarize the above results",
    ", we list the possible quark and hadronic components of the @xmath0 in table  1 .",
    "for an ordinary baryon , the main component would be the three - quark state ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the existence of the meson - baryon component ( @xmath24 ) in baryonic system is also known , for instance , by the pion cloud in the ground state nucleon .",
    "there could be further contribution from other components on top of @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that we distinguish the meson - baryon state @xmath24 from five - quark state @xmath25 ; the former is a combination of two color singlet hadrons , while the latter is defined as a totally color singlet five - quark state which has no overlap with the @xmath24 state.@xcite    the analysis of renormalization procedure@xcite implies that the @xmath0 resonance is dominated by the @xmath24 dynamical component .",
    "the result of the @xmath19 scaling@xcite indicates that the three - quark component of the @xmath0 is small , although we can not specify the explicit origin of the resonance by itself .",
    "the study of the electromagnetic properties@xcite shows that the size of the @xmath0 is larger than the ordinary baryons .",
    "it is remarkable that all three different analyses are consistent with the dominance of meson - baryon molecule structure of the @xmath0 .",
    "the possible antikaon binding in nucleus was discussed in refs .   using phenomenological @xmath1 interaction . it was argued that the strong @xmath1 attraction would cause many interesting phenomena in kaonic nuclei .",
    "stimulated by recent experimental searches , this topic is now lively discussed .",
    "since we have a theoretical framework of chiral dynamics , which reproduces the experimental data of @xmath4 scattering quite well , it is natural to ask what chiral dynamics tells us about the kaonic nuclei .    for this purpose ,",
    "an effective single - channel @xmath1 potential is derived in chiral dynamics,@xcite which enables a standard variational calculation of the few - body kaonic nuclei .",
    "the strategy is as follows : ( a ) we transform the original coupled - channel framework into the single channel problem , and ( b ) we construct an equivalent potential to be used in the schrdinger equation of single channel . in step ( a )",
    ", the effect of the @xmath5 channel is included in the single - channel effective @xmath1 interaction within an exact transformation .",
    "step ( b ) requires a local approximation for the potential in coordinate space , but we impose the constraint that the potential should reproduce the scattering amplitude of chiral coupled - channel approach .    in this way we construct an effective @xmath1 potential , which incorporates the dynamics of @xmath5 and reproduces the scattering amplitude in chiral dynamics .",
    "the strength of the attraction turns out to be about a half of the phenomenological potential of refs .  .",
    "indeed , the variational calculation of @xmath26 system with this potential shows a small binding energy of about 20 mev.@xcite let us consider the reason for the weaker interaction .",
    "actually the consequence of the weaker attraction is seen in the two - body scattering amplitude.@xcite the resonance position in the @xmath1 amplitude appears at around 1420 mev , not at the nominal position of 1405 mev .",
    "since the binding energy measured from the @xmath1 threshold is reduced to 15 mev , the effective @xmath1 interaction is less attractive .",
    "the shift of the resonance energy is the key to determine the strength of the attraction .",
    "note that the @xmath2 amplitude , which corresponds to the observed spectrum , shows the resonance structure at around 1405 mev .",
    "the difference between the resonance positions in the @xmath1 and @xmath5 channels was discussed in ref .  .",
    "it turns out that there are two poles for this resonance , and the poles couple to the @xmath1 and @xmath5 states with different weights , so that the spectrum differs each other . in ref .",
    ", it is pointed out that the diagonal couplings in eq .",
    "are attractive enough to generate singularities of scattering amplitude in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the phenomenological potential,@xcite where the diagonal @xmath2 interaction is set to be zero .",
    "the strong @xmath2 attraction in chiral dynamics eventually reduce the strength in the equivalent local @xmath1 potential .",
    "the coupling strengths in eq .",
    "are strictly governed by the flavor su(3 ) symmetry and this feature is also shared with the traditional coupled - channel approach by dalitz.@xcite    from a schematic viewpoint , the phenomenological potential@xcite describes the @xmath0 as a feshbach resonance : quasibound @xmath1 state embedded in the @xmath2 continuum . in the chiral scheme , the driving force to generate the @xmath0 is the attraction in the @xmath1 channel , while the @xmath2 system is also strongly and attractively interacting . as a consequence , effective @xmath1 interaction is less attractive than the phenomenological one , in order to achieve the same spectrum of the @xmath0 .",
    "we have reviewed some recent development in chiral su(3 ) dynamics related to the @xmath3 meson - baryon scattering . within the present framework , we find that the structure of the @xmath0 is dominated by the meson - baryon molecule component .",
    "the effective @xmath1 interaction turns out to be less attractive than the phenomenologically constructed one , because of the strong @xmath2 dynamics constrained by chiral su(3 ) symmetry .",
