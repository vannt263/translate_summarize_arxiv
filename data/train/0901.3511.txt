    "the correct definition of a physical measurement requires the identification of an appropriate frame of reference .",
    "this applies also to the case of the determination of position and motion of a star from astrometric observations made from within our solar system .",
    "moreover , modern instruments homed into space - borne astrometric probes like gaia @xcite and sim @xcite are targeting accuracy at the micro - arsecond level , or higher , thus requiring any astrometric measurement be modelled in a way that light propagation and detection are both conceived in a general relativistic framework .",
    "one needs , in fact , to solve the relativistic equations of the null geodesic which describes the trajectory of a photon emitted by a star and detected by an observer with an assigned state of motion .",
    "the whole process takes place in a geometrical environment generated by an n - body distribution as could be that of our solar system .",
    "essential to the solution of the above astrometric problem , namely an inverse ray tracing from observational data , is the identification , as boundary conditions , of the local observer s line - of - sight defined in a suitable reference frame ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    summarizing from the references quoted above",
    ", the astrometric problem consists in the determination , from a prescribed set of observational data ( hereafter _ observables _ ) of the astrometric parameters of a star namely its coordinates , parallax , and proper motion .",
    "however , while in classical ( non relativistic ) astrometry these quantities are well defined , in general relativity ( gr ) they must be interpreted consistently with the relativistic framework of the model .",
    "similarly , the parameters describing the attitude and the center - of - mass motion of the satellite need to be defined consistently with the chosen relativistic model .    at present , three conceptual frameworks are able to treat the astrometric problem at the micro - arcsecond level within a relativistic context .",
    "the first model , named grem ( gaia relativsitic model ) and described in @xcite , is an extension of a seminal study @xcite conducted in the framework of the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation of gr .",
    "this model has been formulated according to a parametrized post newtonian ( ppn ) scheme accurate to 1  micro - arcsecond . in this model",
    "finite dimensions and angular momentum of the bodies of the solar system are included and linked to the motion of the observer in order to consider the effects of parallax , aberration , and proper motion .",
    "this model is considered as baseline for the gaia data reduction @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions are fixed by the coordinate position of the satellite and imposing the value of @xmath0 to the modulus of the light direction at past null infinity .",
    "the light path is solved using a matching technique which links the perturbed internal solution inside the near - zone of the solar system with the ( assumed ) flat external one .    conceptually similar to the above model",
    "is the one developed in @xcite . using the post - minkowskian ( pm ) approximation ,",
    "einstein s equations are solved in the linear regime expressing the perturbated part of the metric tensor in terms of retarded lienard - weichert potentials .",
    "later , @xcite included all the relativistic effects related to the gravitomagnetic field produced by the traslational velocity / spin - depedent metric terms .",
    "both works , in the pn and pm aproaches , rewrite the null geodesic as function of two independent parameters and solve the light trajectory as a straight line ( euclidean geometry ) plus integrals , containing the perturbations encountered , from a gravitating source at an arbitrary distance from an observer located within the solar system .",
    "this allows one to transform the observed light ray in a suitable coordinate direction and to read - off the aberrational terms and light deflections effects , evaluated at the point of observation .",
    "the main difference between the two approximations appears in the computation of the light deflection contributions : in the pn scheme by the technique of asymptotic matching , while in the pm one by a semi - analytical integration of the equation of light propagation from the observer to the source with retarted time as argument .",
    "the third and last model , ramod , is an astrometric model conceived to solve the inverse ray - tracing problem in a general relativistic framework not constrained by a priori approximations @xcite .",
    "it exploits the concept of a curved geometry as a common background to all steps of its functioning and can be extended to whatever accuracy and physical requirements @xcite .",
    "ramod therefore is not a just a pn model , contrary to how was referenced in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the same parametrization of the pn / pm approximations can be obtained in ramod if we limit the model accuracy to the milli - arcsecond level @xcite .",
    "the full development to the micro - arcsecond level imposes to include the @xmath1 metric terms and to take properly into account the retarded distance effects due to the motion of the bodies of the solar system @xcite .",
    "at present , the ramod full solution requires the numerical integration of a set of coupled non linear differential equations ( also called `` master equations '' ) which allows to trace back the light trajectory to the star initial position and which naturally includes all the effects due to the curvature of the background geometry .",
    "a solution of this system of differential equations contains all the relativistic perturbations suffered by the photon along its trajectories due to the intervening gravitational fields .",
    "the boundary conditions fixed by the astrometric observable as function of an analytical fully relativistic description of the satellite allows a unique solution for a stellar position and motion @xcite .",
    "the first two models , namely the pn and pm ones , though different , take advantage of a similar `` language '' that facilitate their comparison .",
    "ramod , on the contrary , is formulated in a completely different way .",
    "this makes its comparison with the former two a difficult task .",
    "however , since they are used for the gaia data reduction with the purpose to create a catalog of _ absolute _ positions and proper motions , any inconsistency in the relativistic model(s ) would invalidate the quality and reliability of the estimates .",
    "this alone is sufficient reason for making a theoretical comparison of the two approaches a necessity .    in this paper",
    "we present the first theoretical comparison , showing how it is possible to `` extract '' the aberration terms from the ramod construct .    in section  [ sec :",
    "the - ramod - frames ] we review all the building steps of the ramod astrometric set - up . in section  [ sec : single  vs .- multi - steps ] we compare the procedures used in grem to those utilized in ramod to define the observables and suggest a possible way to make a comparison between the quantities of these two formulations via the explicitation of the aberration part in the ramod framework .",
    "section  [ sec : aberration - grem ] is devoted to describe the grem calculations of stellar aberration , while the following one shows how the same effect can be recovered in ramod .",
    "section  [ sec : comments ] will finally comment on the results of the comparison and on some crucial points which have to be addressed to proceed further with the theoretical comparison of the two models .",
    "the set - up of any astrometric model implies , primarly , the identification of the gravitational sources and of the background geometry .",
    "then one needs to label the space - time points with a coordinate system .",
    "the above steps allow us to fix a reference frame with respect to which one describes the light trajectory , the motion of the stars and that of the observer .",
    "the ramod framework is based on the weak - field requirement for the background geometry , which in turn has to be specialized to the particular case one wants to model .",
    "for example , having in mind a gaia - like mission , we can assume the solar system as the only source of gravity , i.e. a physical system gravitationally bound and weakly relativistic .",
    "then , only first order terms in the metric perturbation @xmath2 ( or equivalently in the constant @xmath3 as in the post - minkowskian approximation ) are retained .",
    "these terms already include all of the possible @xmath4-order expansions of post - newtonian approach , but just those up to @xmath5 are needed to reach the micro - arcsecond accuracy required for the next generation astrometric missions , like e.g. gaia and sim .    with these assumptions",
    "the background geometry is given by the following line element@xmath6 where @xmath7 collects all non linear terms in @xmath2 , the coordinates are @xmath8 , the origin being fixed at the barycenter of the solar system , and @xmath9 is the minkowskian metric .",
    "for this reason , any comparison between ramod and grem requires that both use the same metric . in the small curvature limit",
    "the metric components used in ramod are @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the gravitational potential and the vector potential generated by all the sources inside the solar system that can be chosen according the iau resolution b1.3 @xcite .",
    "the metric of eq .   is also adopted by grem .",
    "finally the subscripts indicate the order of @xmath15 ( e.g. @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] ) .      in the near zone of the solar system and with the metric , iau resolutions provide the definition of the barycentric celestial reference system ( bcrs ) , and of the satellite reference system ( srs ) @xcite . these resolutions , as remarked above , are based on the pn approximation of gr which is still consistent with ramod , since the perturbation @xmath18 to the minkowskian metric in can be calculated at any desired order of approximations in @xmath19 inside the solar system .    in ramod ( see @xcite )",
    "a bcrs is identified requiring that a smooth family of space - like hypersurfaces exists with equation @xmath20 .",
    "the function @xmath21 can be taken as a time coordinate . on each of these @xmath20 hypersurfaces",
    "one can choose a set of cartesian - like coordinates centered at the barycenter of the solar system ( b ) and running smoothly as parameters along curves which point to distant cosmic sources .",
    "the latters are chosen to assure that the system is kinematically non - rotating .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , together with the time coordinate @xmath21 , provides a basic coordinate representation of the space - time .",
    "any tensorial quantity will be expressed in terms of coordinate components relative to coordinate bases induced by the bcrs .      in ramod , at any space - time point there exists a unitary four - vector @xmath25 which is tangent to the world line of a physical observer at rest with respect to the spatial grid of the bcrs defined as : @xmath26    the totality of these four - vectors over the space - time forms a vector field which is proportional to a time - like and asymptotically killing vector field @xcite .",
    "the proper time measured by each of these observers is proportional to the bcrs coordinate time according to equation . to the order of accuracy required for gaia , the rest space of @xmath27 can be locally identified by a spatial triad of unitary and orthogonal vectors whose choice however can only be dictated by specific requirements .",
    "a natural choice is that of pointing to the local coordinate directions chosen of the bcrs ( figure [ bcrs_local - global ] ) .",
    "the local observer world line with respect to the bcrs coordinate system .",
    "the spatial axes of the bcrs point toward distant sources .",
    "the dashed lines are the world lines of the observers at rest with respect to the barycenter ( b ) .",
    "the rest - space ( green area ) of @xmath27 locally deviates from the space - like hypersurface with equation @xmath28 by terms of the order of a micro - arcsecond . ]",
    "this frame will be called _ local bcrs _ ; obviously , the local proper time varies as a function of the gravitational potential at the observer s position , as can be deduced from equation . in the ramod formalism",
    "this local bcrs is represented by a tetrad whose spatial axes ( the triad ) coincide with the local coordinate axes , but whose origin is the barycenter of the satellite . at the @xmath29 ,",
    "this triad is @xcite@xmath30 for @xmath31 .    in ramod",
    "any physical measurement refers to the local bcrs .",
    "the proper reference frame of a satellite consists of its rest - space and a clock which measures the satellite proper time .",
    "the tensorial quantity which expresses a proper reference frame of a given observer is a _",
    "tetrad adapted to that observer _ , namely a set of four unitary mutually orthogonal four - vectors @xmath32 one of which , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath33 , is the observer s four - velocity while the other @xmath34s form a spatial triad of space - like four - vectors .",
    "mathematically the tetrad is found as a solution of the following system @xcite:@xmath35 which allows one to interpret a tetrad frame also as an _ instantaneous inertial _ reference frame .",
    "the solution of , always computed w.r.t .",
    "the bcrs , is not trivial since it depends on the metric at each space - time point along the world line of the observer .",
    "the physical measurements made by the observer ( satellite ) represented by such a tetrad are obtained by projecting the appropriate tensorial quantities on the tetrad axes .",
    "the same measurements can also be defined by splitting the space - time into two _",
    "subspaces_. a time - like observer @xmath36 carrying its laboratory is usually represented as a world tube ; in the case of a non - extended body , the world tube can be restricted to a world line tracing the history of the observer s barycenter in the given space - time . at any point @xmath37 along the world line of @xmath36 , and within a sufficiently small neighborhood , it is possible to split the space - time into a one - dimensional space and a three - dimensional one @xcite , each space being endowed with its own metric , respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "clearly ,    @xmath40    the space with metric @xmath41 is generated by lines which stem orthogonally to the world - line of @xmath42 at @xmath37 and is denoted as the rest - space of the observer @xmath42 at @xmath37 . in this space one measures proper lengths .",
    "the space with metric @xmath43 is generated by lines which differ from that of @xmath42 by a riparametrization . in this space one",
    "measures the observer s proper time .    as a consequence of equation",
    ", the invariant interval between two events in space - time can be written as @xmath44 , from which we are able to extract the measurements of infinitesimal spatial distances and times intervals taken by @xmath45 as , respectively , @xmath46 and @xmath47    essentially , the last method is equivalent to the tetrad formalism , when we do not know the solution of and we need to know only the _ moduli _ of the physical quantities .",
    "as far as ramod is concerned , given the metric and in the case of a gaia - like mission , an explicit analitic expression for a tetrad adapted to the satellite four - velocity exists and can be found in @xcite .",
    "the spatial axes of this tetrad are used to model the attitude of the satellite . moreover , from eq .  , it is possibile to deduce the iau trasformations between the observer s proper time and the barycentric coordinate time , without using any matching tecnique @xcite",
    ". this finally sets the running time on board and completes the definition of the proper reference frame for the gaia - like satellite .",
    "the classical ( non relativistic ) approach of astrometry has traditionally privileged a `` multi - step '' definition of the observable ; i.e. , the quantities which ultimately enter the `` final '' catalogue and are referred to a global inertial reference system , are obtained taking into account , one by one and independently from each other , effects such as aberration and parallax .",
    "grem reproduces in a relativistic framework this approach of classical astrometry .",
    "the bcrs is , for this model , the equivalent of the inertial reference system of the classical approach , while the final expression of the star direction in the bcrs is obtained after converting the observed direction into coordinate ones in several steps which divide the effects of the aberration , the gravitational deflection , the parallax , and proper motion @xcite .    in the previous section",
    "we have mentioned that ramod relies on the tetrad formalism for the definition of the observable . in general , the three direction cosines which identify the local line - of - sight to the observed object are relative to a spatial triad @xmath48 associated to a given observer @xmath42 ; the direction cosines w.r.t .",
    "the axes of this triad are defined as:@xmath49 where @xmath50 is the four - vector tangent to the null geodesic connecting the star to the observer , and all the quantities are obviously computed at the event of the observation .    as a consequence of this definition ,",
    "given the solution of the null geodesic equation and the motion and the attitude of the observer , equation   expresses a relation between the unknowns , namely the position and motion of the star , and the observable quantities which includes all of the above effects mentioned for grem .",
    "in other words , in ramod it is not needed and not natural to disentangle each single effect , relativistic or not .",
    "for this reason any attempt to make a theoretical comparison between the two models is difficult , but the way how the observer tetrad was found in ramod suggests a way to overcome this problem .    in @xcite the attitude frame @xmath48 was strictly specified for measurements made by a gaia - like observer .",
    "let us summarize the main steps",
    ".    given the tetrad @xmath51 adapted to the local barycentric observer as defined in ( @xcite and reference therein ) the vectors of the triad @xmath52 are boosted to the satellite rest frame by means of an instantaneous lorentz transformation which depends on the relative spatial velocity @xmath53 of the satellite identified by the four - velocity @xmath36 w.r.t .",
    "the local bcrs @xmath25 , and whose lorentz factor is given by @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the boosted tetrad @xmath55 obtained in this way represents , simarly to what is defined for gaia in @xcite , a _ _ comrs _ _ ( center - of - mass reference system , comoving with the satellite ) .",
    "in addition to the definition in the cited works one of the axes is _ sun - locked , i.e. _ one axis points toward the sun at any point of its lissajous orbit around l2 , in order to deduce the gaia attitude frame .",
    "this final task is obtained by applying the following rotations to the _ sun - locked frame _ :",
    "1 .   by an angle @xmath56 about the vector @xmath57 which points constantly towards the sun , where @xmath58 is the angular velocity of precession ; 2 .   by a fixed angle @xmath59 about the image of the vector @xmath60 after the previous rotation ; 3 .   by an angle @xmath61 about the image of the vector @xmath57 after the previous two rotations , where @xmath62 is now the spin angular velocity .",
    "the triad resulting from these three steps establishes the satellite _ attitude triad _ ,",
    "given by:@xmath63 the final triad @xmath48 should be the equivalent , in the ramod formalism , to the satellite reference system ( srs ) @xcite of grem .",
    "once this procedure is completed , the final measurements will naturally entangle in a single result every g r `` effect '' .",
    "therefore , the natural way to `` extract '' any of those effects in a separate formula , is to consider equation   and express the observable as a function of the appropriate tetrad .",
    "as well known stellar aberration arises from the motion of the observer relative to the bcrs origin , assumed to coincide with the center of mass of the solar system . in order to account for stellar aberration in the algorithm for the reduction of the astrometric observations , the pn / pm approaches @xcite transform the observed direction to the source ( @xmath64 ) into the bcrs spatial coordinate direction of the light ray at the point of observation @xmath65 ( see figure [ fig : vecs ] ) .",
    "now , paraphrasing @xcite , the coordinate direction to the light source at @xmath66 is defined by the four - vector @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath21 being the bcrs coordinates .",
    "but the coordinate components @xmath70 are not a directly observable quantities ; the observed vector towards the light source is the four - vector @xmath71 , defined with respect to the local inertial frame of the observer . in the local frame : @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the coordinates in the comrs , then in order to deduce the spatial direction @xmath70 from @xmath74 it is chosen to proceed as follows .    the vectors representing the light direction in the pm / pn approches inside the near - zone of the solar system.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    from the property of a null trajectory and taking into account the metric which defines the bcrs it is    @xmath75 namely @xmath76+\\\\ 2\\delta_{ij}\\left(-2\\left(1+\\gamma\\mathrm{_{\\mathrm{ppn}}}\\right)\\frac{w^{i}(t , x)}{c^{3}}\\right)p^{j}+\\delta_{ij}\\left(1+\\frac{\\left(1+\\gamma\\mathrm{_{\\mathrm{ppn}}}\\right)w(t , x)}{c^{2}}\\right)p^{i}p^{j } & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the euclidean modulus of the spatial vector @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the ppn parameter .",

    "their different mathematical structures hinder a straightforward comparison and call for a more in - depth analysis of the two models . because of the structure of grem , the earliest stage of a theoretical comparison starts with the evaluation of the aberration `` effect '' in ramod . in this regard",
    ", we can evidence the following differences in : ( i ) the choice of the boundary conditions , ( ii ) the tools needed to define the astrometric measurements , ( iii ) the attitude implementation , ( iv ) the definition of the proper light direction .",
    "crucial is point ( i ) .",
    "the light signal arriving at the local bcrs along the spatial direction @xmath160 satisfies the ramod master equations , namely a set of non - linear coupled differential equations @xcite .",
    "therefore the cosines ( i.e. the astrometric measurements ) taken as a function of the local line - of - sight ( the _ physical one _ ) , at the time of observation ( @xmath161 ) , allow to fix the boundary conditions needed to solve the master equations and to determine _ uniquely _ the star coordinates . however , since the direction cosines are expressed in terms of the attitude , the mathematical characterization of the attitude frame is _ essential _ to complete the boundary value problem in the process of reconstructing the light trajectory .",
    "the vector @xmath131 , i.e. the `` aberration - free '' counterpart of @xmath162 in grem , is instead used to derive the aberration effect ( in a coordinate language ) and there is no need to connect it with a ramod - like boundary value problem .    as for the solution of the geodesic equation , ramod defines a complete procedure to derive the satellite attitude which depends as input only on the specific terms of the metric that describes the addressed physical problem .",
    "grem , instead , embeds the definitions of its main reference system ( bcrs ) within the metric , consequently each further step depends on this choice .",
    "this includes all the subsequents transformations among the reference systems which are essential to extract the grem observable as function of the astrometric unknowns . on the other side ,",
    "the ramod analytical solution for the attitude frame assures controlled alghoritms that can be directly implemented in the solution of the astrometric problem and guarantee its consistency with gr . in ramod",
    "the direction cosines link the attitude of the satellite to the measurements , compacting several reference frames useful to determine , as final task , the stellar coordinates _",
    "_ : _ _ the bcrs ( kinematically non - rotating global reference rame ) , the comrs ( a local reference frame comoving with the satellite centre of mass ) , and the srs ( the attitude triad of the satellite ) .",
    "the coordinate transformations between bcrs / comrs / srs come out naturally once the iau conventions are adopted .",
    "this is inside the conceptual framework of ramod , where the astrometric set - up allows to trace back the light ray to the emitting star in a curved geometry , and it is not natural to disentangle each single effect .",
    "any approximation can be applied _ a posteriori _ where it is needed , case by case .",
    "this explains items ( ii ) and ( iii ) and introduces item ( iv ) .",
    "the direction cosines being physical quantities not depending on the coordinates , are a powerful tool to compare the astrometric relativistic models : their physical meaning allow us to correctly intepret the astrometric parameters in terms of coordinate quantities .",
    "this justified the conversion of the physical stellar proper direction of ramod into its analgous euclidean coordinate counterpart , which ultimately leads to the derivation of a grem - style aberration formula .",
    "another point arises when the observables of ramod have to be identified with components of the observed @xmath74 of grem .",
    "this matching is admitted only if the origins of the boosted local bcrs tetrad in ramod and of the comrs in grem concide .",
    "to what extent the process of star coordinate `` reconstruction '' is consistent with gr&theory of measurements ?",
    "solving the astrometric problem in practice means to compile an astrometric catalogue at same order of accuracy of the measurements .",
    "this paper shows that , already at the level of the aberration effect , a correct treatment of physical meaurements in terms of coordinate quantities needs particular care in order to avoid misunderstandings in the interpretation of the quantities which constitute the final catalogue .    as a closing consideration",
    ", the computation of the bcrs stellar direction in grem needs to extract , at a second stage , the deflection terms from the coordinate `` aberration - free '' direction @xmath163 .",
    "this problem in ramod is , again , embedded in the formulation of the astrometric problem as `` global solution '' which aims at recovering the star coordinates by integration of the geodesic equations ( treated with an appropriate physical boundary condition and approriate reference systems ) where the deflection terms play the most fundamental role ."
