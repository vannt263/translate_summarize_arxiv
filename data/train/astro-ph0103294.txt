    "stars of low to intermediate main - sequence mass , up to about 6 - 8@xmath6 , will eventually evolve up the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ( iben & renzini 1983 ) . at the tip of the agb , where they combine a low effective temperatures ( @xmath7 ) with high luminosities ( @xmath8 ) , the stars pulsate and are subject to rapid mass loss .",
    "typical examples of such stars are the miras and the oh / ir stars ( e.g. feast & whitelock 1987 ; habing 1996 ) .",
    "their light output varies on timescales from around one hundred days to well over a thousand days .",
    "they also lose mass rapidly ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "they follow various period - luminosity relations and are at or near the maximum luminosity they will ever achieve during their evolution .",
    "this makes them very useful as distance indicators and as probes of galactic structure .",
    "they are also important contributors of dust into the interstellar medium , which may be crucial for the formation of new stars and planets .",
    "jura & kleinmann ( 1989 henceforth jk89 ) identified a group of mass losing agb stars within about 1kpc of the sun . in 1989",
    "a monitoring programme of stars in the jk89 sample visible from the southern hemisphere was initiated from saao .",
    "this entailed obtaining near - infrared photometry at @xmath10 over a time interval of several years , from which pulsation periods could be determined .",
    "the aim of this study was to investigate the physical properties of the sample , in particular variability , colours , mass - loss rates and kinematics , using saao photometry together with infrared photometry and kinematic data from the literature .",
    "finally these data are used to estimate the average progenitor mass and lifetime of stars in this high mass - loss phase .",
    "jk89 aimed to develop a more quantitative understanding of mass loss from local agb stars .",
    "they identified agb stars undergoing heavy mass loss ( @xmath11 ) , henceforth referred to as dust - enshrouded , within about 1kpc of the sun , and within @xmath12 .",
    "their selection was based on infrared photometry from the two micron sky survey , iras and the afgl survey from which they identify 63 sources .",
    "they give reasons for thinking this sample was reasonably complete .",
    "a few comments should be made at this point .",
    "jk89 assume a luminosity of @xmath13 for all of these agb stars .",
    "it will be seen later that , if the period luminosity relation ( pl ) is correct , this leads to the inclusion of more luminous oh / ir stars outside the 1kpc sphere and up to @xmath14kpc away .",
    "they note that some red supergiants will satisfy their selection criteria ; those they largely excluded , but included the star 3 puppis , an a supergiant , with the idea that it might be undergoing the transition from agb star to planetary nebula .",
    "however , plets , waelkens & trams ( 1995 ) convincingly showed that 3 puppis is a genuine massive supergiant , and we therefore exclude it from this study .",
    "jk89 also included the carbon - rich planetary nebulae ngc 7027 ( e.g. justtanont et al . 2000 ) in their sample ; this object is excluded from the present study .",
    "the remaining 61 sources are listed in table 1 ( this includes 3 m supergiants , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( ukita & goldsmith 1984 ; winfrey et al .",
    "1994 ) of which we only became aware part the way through this project ) .",
    "near - infrared data are tabulated for two of them , but none are used in the analysis .",
    "chemical types ( o and c for oxygen- and carbon - rich , respectively ) for all the sources were taken from loup et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and spectral types obtained from the simbad data base for 51 of the sources are also listed in table 1 . although @xmath18 is listed as m6 in simbad , groenewegen ( 1994 ) suggests this is incorrect and the star is actually carbon rich ; therefore no spectral type is assigned to it here .",
    "the supergiants are marked ( i ) .",
    "the final sample thus consists of 27 carbon - rich stars and 31 oxygen - rich stars ( excluding the 3 supergiants ) of which 2 are s - type .",
    "almost all of the stars are of very late spectral type ( m , c , n , r and s ) , with two exceptions : the red rectangle and the egg nebula .",
    "both are well - known carbon - rich bipolar reflection nebulae ( see , e.g. sahai et al .",
    "1998 ; waters et al .",
    "the red rectangle is a wide binary system with an oxygen - rich dust disk ( waters et al .",
    "these two objects are generally thought to be post - agb stars on their way to become planetary nebulae .",

    "20 were detected in oh and 20 in @xmath19 . while 19 of the 21 sources searched for sio were detected .",
    "interestingly , 4 of the 11 carbon - rich stars which were searched for sio also had positive detections .",
    "we can thus estimate that 70 percent of the oxygen - rich stars have oh and @xmath19 maser emission and about 90 percent have sio emission .    from the number of references listed in tables 1 , cw leo stands out as the best studied source in this sample .",
    "about 50 molecular species have been detected in its envelope ( wallerstein & knapp 1998 ) which is more than for any other source .",
    "the full sample consists mainly of cool variable stars with a few possible post - agb objects .",
    "near - infrared observations were obtained in the @xmath10 bands ( 1.2 , 1.65 , 2.2 and 3.45@xmath20 m ) for 42 of the 45 southern sources , defined henceforth as stars with @xmath21 .",
    "some of these 42 stars were selected exclusively from jk89 , while the others were already part of other monitoring programmes .",
    "the remaining three southern stars ( @xmath22 , @xmath15 and rafgl 1406 ) were not observed because they were in crowded fields and confusion rendered observations with a single channel photometer impossible ( note that winfrey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) suggest that @xmath15 is actually a supergiant and it is therefore not referred to again ) .",
    "the near - infrared observations for the 42 southern sources , accurate to @xmath23mag and better ( 0.03mag in @xmath24 and 0.05mag in @xmath25 in the majority of cases ) , are listed in table 2 .",
    "the magnitudes from the 0.75 m reflector are on the saao system as defined by carter ( 1990 ) .",
    "the @xmath26 bands for the 1.9 m reflector are assumed to be identical to those of the 0.75 m reflector , while the @xmath27-magnitude is converted to the saao system .    in some instances ,",
    "no observations are listed because the sources were too faint to be reliably measured through the relevant filter with a particular telescope .",
    "the times of the observations are given as julian dates from which 2440000 days has been subtracted .",
    "in addition to the data from table  2 , published saao observations from whitelock et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997a ) and lloyd evans ( 1997 ) have been used in the analysis , together with several unpublished observations from lloyd evans ( private communication ) with a sum total of 848 measurements .",
    "mean magnitudes calculated from the average of observed values at maximum and minimum light are listed in table 3 and compared with the fourier mean in appendix a. these two averages compare fairly well , differences were less than 0.3mag for the @xmath27-band and less than about 0.1mag for the @xmath26 bands .",
    "table 3 also lists mean @xmath28-magnitudes calculated as above from values listed in the literature , for the 20 remaining stars with no near - infrared saao photometry .",
    "infrared fluxes at 12 , 25 and @xmath29 m were taken from the iras point source catalog ( psc ) and colour corrected as specified in the iras explanatory supplement ( es ) .",
    "the results are listed in table 4 together with the iras flux - quality designations and the iras variability index ( v.i . ) , which gives the probability that the source is variable in units of 0.1 ( see iras es ) .",
    "table 4 also contains @xmath30 m magnitudes from the _ revised airforce geophysics laboratory , rafgl _ , survey .",
    "the iras low resolution spectral classifications , from olnon & raimond ( 1986 ) or loup et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , are listed in table 4 .",
    "note that @xmath16 does not have a published classification so we examined the spectrum in the iras low resolution spectra electronic database at the university of calgary .",
    "it shows a weak @xmath31 m emission feature , but no @xmath32 m feature , which is present in the spectra of all the other oxygen - rich stars .",
    "it is actually a supergiant as discussed below ( section 4 ) .",
    "using the data in table 2 , the southern sources were classified as variable in the near - infrared if the difference between the maximum and minimum magnitudes at @xmath28 and/or at @xmath25 was greater than 0.1 mag ; thirty seven of the stars are variable and 2 non - variable .",
    "the only two decisively non - variable stars , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are the supergiants ( see section 2 ) .",
    "there were insufficient observations to determine if the other 6 stars are variable or not .",
    "table 5 lists the variability information .",
    "period determinations , using fourier transforms of the @xmath28 light curve , were made for all variables with measurements on at least 10 epochs .",
    "plausible , although not definitive , periods were also established for some sources with as few as 8 measurements . for the very red source @xmath33 , a period could only be estimated from the @xmath25 data .",
    "periods , listed in table 5 , were thus determined for a total of 20 stars , and phased @xmath28 light curves for these are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "where possible the fourier transform analysis was carried out at the other wavelengths and in all cases the periods found were within 2 percent of those listed in table 5 .",
    "no period determination was possible for @xmath34 ( w aql ) , although it had been observed on 12 epochs .",
    "this is because 6 of the epochs were between 1968 and 1982 when this carbon star was undergoing a dust obscuration episode ( mattei & foster 1997 ) .",
    "such an event would disrupt the apparent periodicity .",
    "the average of periods found in the literature are listed in table 5 , with references , for the 47 stars concerned . where there are periods in common none of them differs significantly from those determined here . in the following analysis our own determinations ,",
    "where available , are used in preference to others , except for @xmath35 and @xmath36 where our determination is uncertain due to the small number of measurements available .      using the periods found for these 20 stars ,",
    "the relative data were phased , arbitrarily assuming zero phase at jd 2440000.00 , where jd is the heliocentric julian date .",
    "these phased light - curves are plotted in fig .",
    "1 together with least squares fits to the data of the form :    = 14.5 cm    = 14.5 cm    @xmath37    where m is the magnitude in a particular band , @xmath38 the peak to peak amplitude , @xmath39 related to the phase , @xmath40 , by @xmath41 and @xmath42 the phase angle at zero phase .",
    "@xmath43 is the mean magnitude .",
    "one immediate observation from most of the phased light - curves is that at a given phase there is a range of magnitudes , rather than one sharply defined magnitude .",
    "this is not , in general , due to observational error , but is contributed to by various effects .",
    "first , miras and oh / ir stars are erratic pulsators in the sense that their light curves do not exactly repeat from one cycle to the next at visual or infrared wavelengths ( koen & lombard 1995 ; whitelock , marang & feast 2000 ) secondly , some stars , particularly carbon stars go through faint phases from time to time due to variable dust obscuration , e.g. @xmath44 ( r for , see whitelock et al 1997a ) .",
    "thirdly , a very small number of stars show temporal or long term changes in luminosity , amplitude and/or period , possibly due to evolutionary effects ( whitelock 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "many of the light curves in fig .",
    "1 show clear departures from simple sinusoids and would be better fitted by the inclusion of one or two harmonics , in particular , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the most strikingly odd curve is that of @xmath47 ( v hya ) which is discussed below .",
    "v hya is a well studied carbon star and semi - regular variable .",
    "it has a bipolar circumstellar outflow , and models invoke rotation of the central star or the presence of a binary companion to explain bipolar outflows ( barnbaum , morris & kahane 1995 ) .",
    "2a illustrates the light curve for v hya using @xmath28 magnitudes measured from saao , including material from lloyd evans ( 1997 and private communication ) together with the data from table 2 .",
    "in addition to the regular pulsation v hya experienced two faint phases around jd2443500 and 2449500 .",
    "a fourier analysis of the @xmath28 data when the star is bright , between jd2446000 and 2448250 provide a period of 530 days , identical to the value given in the gcvs .",
    "2b shows the data phased at this period and illustrates the double peak caused by harmonics in the light curve .",

    "they confirm and refine the very long period found by mayall ( 1965 ) at @xmath48 days .",
    "the two faint phases seen in fig .",
    "2a are consistent with this long period .",
    "the amplitudes of these 6160 day variations are at least 2.4 , 2.1 , 1.7 and 0.7 mag , at @xmath10 , respectively , while @xmath49 mag ( knapp et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "barnbaum et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found evidence for rapid rotation in v hya , using spectral line broadening analysis .",
    "they suggest that the long term variation can be attributed to a coupling between the radial pulsation , with period of 530 days , and the rotation of the star with a very similar period .",
    "it is not clear how this interaction would give rise to the very long period without strongly modulating the shorter period , or why it should result in the observed reddening of the star during the faint phases .",
    "lloyd evans ( 1997 ) suggested that the long period may be the result of obscuration events like those observed in r for . although the colours would be consistent with this , the regularity of the long period ( knapp et al .",
    "1999 ) is quite unlike the effect observed in r for and this explanation therefore seems unlikely .",
    "knapp et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the other hand , suggest that the long - period dimming of this star is due to a thick dust cloud orbiting the star and attached to a binary companion .",
    "indeed , there is evidence for large numbers of late - type binaries in the lmc ( wood et al .",
    "1999 ) , so this may not be rare occurrence .",
    "the colour variations of v  hya are less extreme than those expected from optically thin interstellar dust , but they could be explained by large particles .      the period distributions for the oxygen- and carbon - rich stars are plotted in fig .  3 .",
    "most of the stars in the sample have periods between 500 and 700 days and almost all have periods between 300 and 900 days .",

    "longer period miras have more massive progenitors and are therefore lower scale heights .",
    "it is not surprising to find more of them in the solar neighbourhood than in the galactic cap .",
    "a comparison of the period distributions of the oxygen- and carbon - rich stars is instructive .",
    "there are no carbon - rich stars with periods longer than 1000 days . from fig .",

    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , when applied to these two distributions for periods less than 1000 days , yields a probability that the two distributions come from the same parent population of @xmath51 .",
    "this probability ( @xmath52 ) implies that there is no significant difference in the period distributions for the carbon- and oxygen - rich stars .",

    "for variable stars , such as those discussed here , it is often useful to know the average magnitude at a particular wavelength .",
    "the average magnitude as discussed in section 3 , was taken as the mean of the minimum and maximum magnitude measured for the particular star .",
    "this average , @xmath253 , is compared in table a1 with the average magnitude , @xmath167 , derived from the fit given by equation 4.1 for the 19 stars with sufficient data .",
    "the average absolute difference , @xmath254 , between these two averages , for each near - infrared band , with the sample standard deviation , @xmath255 , on this average is also listed in table a1 . from these values for @xmath254",
    "it can be seen that @xmath253 represents the average magnitude fairly well .",
    "obviously in instances where there are insufficient observations to cover a complete cycle , @xmath253 will be a poor representation of the mean .",
    "the stars in this sample not only vary in light output , but also in colour . in section 5 the average colour of a star",
    "is taken as the mean of the value calculated at each julian date , @xmath256 .",
    "this average is then compared to the average colour , @xmath257 , derived from the fourier fits given by equation 4.1 .",
    "@xmath257 is simply given by : @xmath258 where @xmath259 and @xmath260 are the magnitudes in the bands making up the colour .",
    "@xmath261 and @xmath262 are the average magnitudes in these bands obtained from the fourier fits given by equation 4.1 .",
    "both the averages , for each near - infrared colour , are listed in table a2 for the 18 stars with sufficient data .",
    "also listed in the table are the average absolute difference , @xmath263 and sample standard deviation , @xmath255 , on this average .",
    "the two values are quite comparable ."

    "<S> a study is made of a sample of 58 dust - enshrouded asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( including 2 possible post agb stars ) , of which 27 are carbon - rich and 31 are oxygen - rich . </S>",
    "<S> these objects were originally identified by jura & kleinmann as nearby ( within about 1kpc of the sun ) agb stars with high mass - loss rates ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ground - based near - infrared photometry , data obtained by the iras satellite and kinematic data ( radial and outflow velocities ) from the literature are combined to investigate the properties of these stars . the light amplitude in the near - infrared is found to be correlated with period , and this amplitude decreases with increasing wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> statistical tests show that there is no reason to suspect any difference in the period distributions of the carbon- and oxygen - rich stars for periods less than 1000 days . </S>",
    "<S> there are no carbon - rich stars with periods longer than 1000 days in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the colours are consistent with those of cool stars with evolved circumstellar dust - shells . </S>",
    "<S> luminosities and distances are estimated using a period - luminosity relation . </S>",
    "<S> mass - loss rates , estimated from the @xmath1 m fluxes , show a correlation with various infrared colours and pulsation period . </S>",
    "<S> the mass - loss rate is tightly correlated with the @xmath2 $ ] colour . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics and scale - height of the sample shows that the sources with periods less than 1000 days must have low mass main - sequence progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the three oxygen - rich stars with periods over 1000 days probably had intermediate mass main - sequence progenitors . for the other stars an average progenitor mass of about @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> is estimated with a final white dwarf mass of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the average lifetime of stars in this high mass - loss agb phase is estimated to be about @xmath5 years , which suggests that these stars will undergo at most one more thermal pulse before leaving the agb if current theoretical relations between thermal interpulse - period and core - mass are correct . </S>"
