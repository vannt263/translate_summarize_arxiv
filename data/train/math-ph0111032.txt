    "the study of collisions between photons , the field quanta of the electromagnetic field , and freely moving charged particles , in particular electrons , at energies below the threshold for electron - positron pair creation  commonly called _",
    "compton scattering _  has played a significant r^ ole in establishing the reality of einstein s photons , in the early days of quantum theory . with the development of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) it became possible to calculate the cross section for compton scattering perturbatively , using the feynman rules of relativistic qed .",
    "the agreement between theoretical predictions and experiments is astounding .    yet , a careful theoretical analysis of compton scattering uncovers substantial difficulties mainly related to the so - called _ infrared problem _ in qed , @xcite : when , in the course of a collision process , a charged particle , such as an electron , undergoes an accelerated motion it emits _ infinitely _ many photons of _ finite _ total energy . unless treated carefully , a perturbative calculation of scattering amplitudes is therefore plagued by the infamous infrared divergencies .",
    "infrared divergencies can be eliminated by giving the photon a small mass , or , alternatively , by introducing an infrared cutoff in the interaction term .",
    "of course , after having calculated suitable cross sections , one attempts to let the photon mass or the infrared cutoff , respectively , tend to 0 .",
    "this procedure , carefully implemented , is known to work very well ; see @xcite .",
    "if the total energy of the incoming particles , photons and an electron , is well below the threshold for electron - positron pair creation it is a fairly good approximation to neglect all terms in the hamiltonian of relativistic qed describing pair creation- and annihilation processes in a calculation of some cross section for compton scattering .",
    "the resulting model is a caricature of qed without positrons in which the number of electrons is conserved .",
    "it is this simplified model of qed , regularized in the infrared region by an infrared cutoff , which has inspired the analysis of compton scattering presented in this paper .    to further simplify matters , we consider a toy model involving `` scalar photons '' or `` phonons '' , and we also impose an ultraviolet cutoff in the interaction hamiltonian . but",
    "the methods developed in this paper can be applied to the caricature of qed described above if one works in the coulomb gauge and introduces an ultraviolet and an infrared cutoff in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the main results of this paper can be described as follows : for the toy model described above , we establish _ asymptotic completeness ( ac ) for compton scattering _ below some threshold energy @xmath1 , which depends on the kinematics of the electron and on the coupling constant .",
    "the latter will have to be chosen sufficiently small .",
    "this means that , on the subspace of physical state vectors containing one electron and arbitrarily many `` scalar photons '' ( massless bosons ) of total energy @xmath2 , the scattering operator of our toy model is _",
    "unitary_.    in a previous paper @xcite , we have studied the scattering of massless bosons at an electron bound to a static nucleus , below the ionization threshold , in a similar toy model with an infrared- and an ultraviolet cutoff . in other words , we have proven ac for _ rayleigh scattering _ of `` photons '' at an atom , below the ionization threshold , in the presence of an infrared- and ultraviolet cutoff . by combining the methods in @xcite with those developed in this paper , we expect to be able to establish ac in our toy model of an electron interacting with massless bosons and with a static nucleus at energies below some threshold energy @xmath1 ( depending on the kinematics of the electron ) , provided the coupling constant is small enough .",
    "such a result would apply to scattering processes encountered in the analysis of the photoelectric effect ( see @xcite ) and of bremsstrahlung .",

    "the parameter @xmath23 is a coupling constant .",
