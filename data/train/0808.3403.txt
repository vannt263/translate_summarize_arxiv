    "the quantum walk on the hypercube is a quintessential problem in quantum information processing .",
    "the main uses of quantum walks can be divided into three parts : search , hitting , and fast sampling algorithms .",
    "the first , the search of a database , is based on grover s algorithm , and can be implemented using a quantum walk on a hypercube graph @xcite .",
    "hitting algorithms are those in which a particle can propagate from one node to another node in a graph ( sometimes called the graph traversal problem ) . for the hypercube",
    ", it has been shown that the quantum walk performs this task exponentially faster than classical random walks @xcite ; a graph for which the quantum walk is exponentially faster than all classical algorithms was found by childs _",
    "finally , a fast sampling algorithm approximates a probability distribution ( often uniform ) over some graph starting from a simple initial condition  this is quantified by what is called the mixing time .",
    "the hitting and instantaneous mixing times for the hypercube were found in the seminal work by moore and russell @xcite .",
    "other important works on the hypercube include recent results on the hitting @xcite and mixing times @xcite ; there have also been general reviews on quantum walks @xcite .",
    "in addition to potential algorithms , the quantum walk on the hypercube can be used to devise qubit networks that perfectly transfer a quantum state between nodes @xcite , and could possibly be implemented using superconducting qubits @xcite . for these physical implementations , one must consider the inevitable coupling of each qubit to its environment .",
    "the simplest such model leads to a particular decoherence model , the solution of which is the subject of this paper .",
    "more generally , decoherence in quantum walks may be useful @xcite , and could even have implications for biological systems @xcite .",
    "previous work on decoherence in quantum walks on the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube began with the work by kendon and tregenna @xcite , who looked at a discrete - time quantum walk interrupted by measurements .",
    "they found numerically that by measuring the position of the walk with probability @xmath1 after each time step the first hitting probability was exponentially ( in @xmath0 ) suppressed .",
    "an exact solution for decoherence in a continuous - time walk was found by alagi and russell @xcite , using a model where dephasing occurred between different subspaces of the hypercube . here too , the first hitting probability decays exponentially in @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "i consider a continuous - time decoherence model  here called the vertex model  that is similar to the discrete - time model mentioned above @xcite .",
    "the specific form of this model arose from a study of decoherence in quantum state transfer @xcite . by analyzing the master equation of the vertex model perturbatively ,",
    "an analytical solution is found , good for weak decoherence .",
    "for this model and a natural choice of parameters the quantum probability to traverse a @xmath0-dimensional hypercube remains bounded for all @xmath0 , in opposition to the exponential suppression found previously .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the decoherence models are presented in section ii along with a review of the exact results for the subspace model @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "a perturbative approach is presented , giving an analytical expression for the hitting probability as a function of time . in section iv",
    ", i compare this model with the discrete and continuous models , and discuss the role of information lost due to decoherence .",
    "finally , i conclude in section v by summarizing these results and their implications .",
    "an appendix extends the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and shows how different models of decoherence in a hypercube network of qubits generates the decoherence models considered here .",
    "in this section i first describe two models of decoherence : the subspace model studied by alagi and russell @xcite and the vertex model presented here .",
    "the quantum walk on the hypercube involves the continuous - time dynamics ( with @xmath2 ) @xmath3 where the matrix elements of @xmath4 are proportional to the adjacency matrix of the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube .",
    "the vertices of the hypercube are labeled by bit - strings of length @xmath0 , and two vertices are connected if their labels differ by one bit .",
    "this induces a tensor - product structure , in terms of which the hamiltonian has the simple form @xmath5 where the pauli matrix @xmath6 occurs at location @xmath7 . here and in the following , @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are taken to be dimensionless quantities . using this hamiltonian , one has @xmath10 letting @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the transfer probability from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is given by @xmath15",
    "the first hitting time occurs at @xmath16 , with unit probability .    in the presence of decoherence",
    ", however , this simple dynamics is modified .",
    "first , the system is no longer described by a wavefunction but rather by a density matrix .",
    "second , the evolution is no longer generated by a hamiltonian operator , but rather by a superoperator , here assumed to be of the general lindblad form @xcite @xmath17 + \\sum_{j } \\lambda_j   ( l_j \\rho l_j^{\\dagger } - \\frac{1}{2 } l_j^{\\dagger } l_j \\rho - \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho l_j^{\\dagger } l_j ) .\\ ] ] the @xmath18 are called the lindblad operators , with rates @xmath19 .",
    "alagi and russell considered lindblad operators of the form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is 0 or 1 ( these should be included in the sum ) and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the projectors for coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "the decoherence rates are all identical @xmath24 ( see section iv for a discussion of these rates ) .",
    "note that these operators do not project the state onto any particular node of the hypercube network , but rather onto one of two subspaces in which the node has a @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) in the @xmath7-th bit .",
    "for this reason , i will call this the subspace model .",
    "the resulting master equation can be given a tensor - product form , which allows for the solution of the density matrix by solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a @xmath27 matrix @xcite .",
    "using these and the initial condition @xmath28 , the hitting probability is @xmath29^d \\end{array } \\label{ssprob}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 .",
    "the decoherence model considered here uses the same general form , again with identical rates @xmath24 but with lindblad operators of the form @xmath31 each @xmath21 being 0 or 1 .",
    "these operators project a state onto the vertex given by @xmath32 .",
    "i call this the vertex model , and note that it can be derived from the master equation for qubits undergoing dephasing independently in a hypercube network , as shown in the appendix . note also that this decoherence model has essentially nothing in common with the graph on which the quantum walk occurs .",
    "this is in constrast to the subspace model , in which decoherence somehow knows the structure of the network .",
    "the vertex model is somewhat more physical , in the sense that for a physical network , decoherence is more likely to affect each vertex independently , and less likely to know about the full hypercube structure .",
    "this will be discussed in sec .",
    "it is instructive to reexpress the master equations in terms of the matrix elements @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for the vertex model",
    ", @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the kronecker delta and @xmath39 .",
    "this master equation involves the decay of all off - diagonal matrix elements with rate @xmath40 , consistent with dephasing of every vertex .",
    "the subspace model has @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the kronecker delta for the @xmath7-th bit of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this too involves the decay of the off - diagonal elements , but these are now weighted by the number of bits in which the indices @xmath43 and @xmath44 differ . those elements with indices differing in @xmath45 bits decay with a rate @xmath46 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising  the subspace model presumably gets less information about the location of the `` walker '' in the quantum walk , yet in the end causes more decoherence than the vertex model .",
    "this will be discussed in section iv .",
    "in the limit of weak decoherence @xmath47 , perturbation theory can be used , starting from the eigenstates of @xmath4 . however , since this is a master equation , careful treatment of degeneracies is required .",
    "these degeneracies could be analyzed using an angular momentum representation or perhaps other group theory methods . here",
    ", however , i will take a direct approach , requiring the following notation .",
    "the density matrix of the hypercube can be rewritten as a vector , using the basis states @xmath48 where each @xmath49 and @xmath50 are either 0 or 1 .",

    "the lindblad superoperator @xmath56 is defined similarly , and is diagonal in this basis : @xmath57    in addition to this basis , i also introduce the eigenstates of @xmath52 , which have the form @xmath58 using the abbreviated notation for the states , with @xmath59 representing bit strings of size @xmath0 , and thus there are @xmath60 terms in the sum .",

    "( [ lbasis1 ] ) and the definition of @xmath63 to find @xmath64 then , using the inverse of eq .",
    "( [ basis2 ] ) @xmath65 and the fact that @xmath66 where @xmath67 is bit - wise addition , i find the result @xmath68 now , since this final sum is over all bit - strings , i can make the substitutions @xmath69 and @xmath70 and sum over @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these substitutions reduce the delta function to @xmath73 , with the final result @xmath74    if all of the states of @xmath52 were nondegenerate , i could simply assert that the effect of decoherence on each state is given by @xmath75 .",
    "however , there are many degeneracies , and so degenerate perturbation theory is required . from eq .",
    "( [ basish ] ) i find that there are @xmath76 subspaces , with eigenvalues @xmath77 , with @xmath78 .",
    "the degeneracy of subspace @xmath45 can be found to be @xmath79 $ ] . in the following",
    ", i will consider @xmath56 projected onto these subspaces ( with the same symbol ) and analyze how it mixes those states within each subspace .",
    "finding the correct form of the eigenstates in these degenerate subspaces requires some additional notation .",
    "consider , for example , the subspace with @xmath80 .",
    "in this subspace , there can be no more than @xmath81 bits of @xmath44 that are unity , and no more than @xmath81 bits of @xmath43 that are zero . letting those bits occur at positions @xmath82 and @xmath7 ( with @xmath83 ) , this can be achieved in one of four ways : @xmath84 note that the indices @xmath82 and @xmath7 label the zeros for @xmath43 and the ones for @xmath44 ; these can be interpreted as the locations of `` excitations . '' using eq .",
    "( [ lbasis2 ] ) , when projected to the @xmath80 subspace the lindblad operator has the following effect @xmath85 where @xmath86 is any of the states in eq .",
    "( [ basis3 ] ) .",
    "these are for @xmath83 . for @xmath87 , however , @xmath88 thus , for the states in this subspace the effect of @xmath56 is to either mix excitations between the @xmath43 and @xmath44 indices , or to distribute `` paired '' excitations over all possible locations .    states with higher @xmath45 can be defined and the effect of @xmath56 can be analyzed in an analogous fashion . for example @xmath89 denotes a state @xmath51 with @xmath45 zeros in @xmath43 , located at positions @xmath90 , and no ones in @xmath44 . to represent the effect of @xmath56 , it is convenient to define the symbol @xmath91 as a type of shift operator , transferring the last unpaired excitation in @xmath43 to @xmath44 , such that @xmath92 in addition",
    ", i define @xmath93 to represent a permutation of @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "for example , @xmath96 where i have reordered the labels to increasing order , with @xmath97 . using these two symbols , i now argue that a correct set of states that diagonalize @xmath56 ( when projected to the relevant subspace ) is given by @xmath98 \\mathcal{p}_{m , n } \\right ) |j_1 \\cdots j_n ; \\emptyset \\rangle_n , \\label{phidef}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "first , it is clear that the probability oscillations decay more quickly in the subspace model with @xmath159 than in the vertex model .",
    "second , while the maximal hitting probability ( which occurs near @xmath160 ) decreases with increasing @xmath0 for both models , it does so much more dramatically for the subspace model .",
    "this is further explored in fig .",
    "[ qwlimit ] . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", the probability @xmath161 for the subspace model decays to zero , while @xmath162 for the vertex model converges to a nonzero value for large @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath161 can be rather simply explained . using the result of eq .",
    "( [ ssprob ] ) , for small @xmath40 , @xmath163 thus , so long as @xmath40 and @xmath164 are independent of @xmath0 , the hitting probability decays exponentially in @xmath0 for the subspace model .    the behavior of @xmath162 is somewhat more subtle .",
    "first , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ vlamb ] ) that @xmath165 , and thus @xmath166 .",
    "this can be used in eqs .",
    "( [ vprob1 ] ) and ( [ vprob2 ] ) to show that @xmath167 this lower limit is shown as the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ qwlimit ] , and is in good agreement with the limiting behavior of the actual @xmath162 .",
    "most importantly , this limit on the hitting probability of the vertex model is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this striking distinction of the vertex and subspace models requires some discussion .",
    "first , as was noted after eqs .",
    "( [ vmodel ] ) and ( [ ssmodel ] ) , the subspace model appears to get less information ( i.e. about subspaces not vertices ) yet causes greater decay of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "this paradox can also be seen in terms of the lindblad operators , of which the subspace model has @xmath168 , while the vertex model has @xmath169 .",
    "presumably more operators should cause more decoherence , but this is not the case .",
    "in fact , the subspace model involves more measurements than the vertex model . to understand",
    "why this is the case , note that both of these master equations can be derived from the following discrete - time process @xcite : @xmath170 this non - unitary evolution describes unitary evolution given by @xmath171 interrupted by @xmath172 measurements specified by the projectors @xmath173 , and each measurement occurring with probability @xmath174 .",
    "the results of these measurements are then ignored , leading to a loss of information .",
    "the projectors here are equal to the lindblad operators specified above .",
    "the operators for the subspace model can be grouped into @xmath175 measurements ( each with 2 projectors summing to the identity ) , while the vertex model has only one ( @xmath176 ) measurement ( with @xmath169 projectors summing to the identity ) .",
    "thus , while each measurement in the subspace model extracts less information , it actually performs @xmath0 measurements , which in the end extracts the same amount of information as the vertex model ( @xmath0 bits ) .    as a second and related point , the original work by alagi and russell used a decoherence rate @xmath177 ( note that in their notation @xmath178 ) .",
    "naively , this would remove the exponential decay seen above .",
    "however , they also used an energy scale @xmath179 , such that the relevant parameter @xmath180 remains fixed , recovering the exponential decay of @xmath161 . clearly ,",
    "allowing the parameters of the model to vary with @xmath0 can remove the exponential decay ; the comparison presented above has the nice feature that in both the vertex and subspace models the system loses information at the same rate ( @xmath181 bits per second ) .    as an alternative perspective , consider a physical hypercube network of qubits designed to implement quantum state transfer @xcite .",
    "in such a network , one expects that it is the number of operators in the system hamiltonian that depends on @xmath0 , and not their strength .",
    "the difference between the subspace and vertex models then consists in how the qubits are coupled to an environment ( causing decoherence ) . as shown in the appendix , if each qubit has its own environment with an independent dephasing process , the corresponding master equation coincides with the vertex model .",
    "however , it is also shown that if certain sets of qubits share multiple environments , chosen in such a way that qubits in the same subspace of the hypercube undergo a collective dephasing process , the corresponding master equation will describe the subspace model .",
    "thus , the two decoherence models correspond to different physical systems .",
    "the heuristic information arguments given above are confirmed by numerical calculations of the entropy @xmath182 $ ] , shown for the vertex model in fig .",
    "[ qwentropy ] , which has the qualitative form @xmath183 for small @xmath9 .",
    "while these calculations are for the vertex model , in the exact solution of the subspace model the total density matrix is equal to the tensor product of @xmath0 copies of the @xmath149 density matrix . thus , the entropy for the @xmath0-dimensional case is simply @xmath0 times that for @xmath149 , for which the vertex and subspace models are identical .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the entropy production ( @xmath184 ) is greatest when the quantum walk is halfway between the initial and final vertices ( e.g. @xmath185 ) . at this time",
    "the system would , in the absence of decoherence , be in a coherent superposition over the entire hypercube .",
    "such a state is greatly disturbed by the position ( vertex or subspace ) measurements , leading to a large increase in entropy .",
    "as seen in the figure , small oscillations in the entropy occur for longer times .",
    "these have twice the frequency of the oscillations in the hitting probability , and occur each time the quantum walk is superposed over the hypercube .",
    "finally , this comparison of information can be used to reconcile the vertex model with the exponential decay found by kendon and tregenna @xcite .",
    "they observed that the discrete - time hitting probability @xmath186 decayed as @xmath187 , where @xmath1 is the probability of making a measurement of the position ( vertex ) after each time step . since the number of time steps for this quantum walk to hit the opposing vertex is @xmath188 , the total amount of information ( with @xmath0 bits per measurement ) extracted during the walk is approximately @xmath189 . for a true comparison , then , i equate this information to the total information extracted in the two models above ( @xmath190 bits ) , and solve for @xmath1 .",
    "the result , @xmath191 , leads to @xmath192 , in approximate agreement with eq .",
    "( [ vbound ] ) above .",
    "thus , so long as one performs less than approximately one complete position measurement for the entire walk , both the discrete and continuous vertex model will hit the opposite vertex with appreciable probability , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion , i have reconsidered the effects of decoherence in the continuous - time quantum walk on the hypercube . by considering a particular model of decoherence ( the vertex model ) ,",
    "i have found that a quantum state initially localized at one vertex will propagate to the opposite vertex with a probability bounded by a constant that is independent of the size of the hypercube .",
    "this is in agreement with an earlier study @xcite of a discrete - time quantum walk , once the information lost to decoherence has been considered .",
    "this is in striking disagreement with another model of decoherence ( the subspace model ) @xcite , in which the same amount of information is lost , but in an apparently much noisier fashion .",
    "i now consider the interpretation of this result .",
    "the subspace model can be interpreted as extracting information by a sequence of @xmath0 measurements , one for each dimension of the hypercube , whereas the vertex model uses a single measurement . by making more measurements to extract the same amount of information",
    ", the subspace model disturbs the quantum walk much more than the vertex model .",
    "the number of these measurements is proportional to the hypercube dimension , and each disturbance prevents the walk from reaching its destination .",
    "it is this proliferation of measurements that leads to an exponential decay of the hitting probability as the hypercube gets larger and larger .",
    "further understanding this nontrivial relationship between information , measurements , and decoherence in quantum walks may be of some value .",
    "indeed , the role of decoherence in the mixing of quantum walks remains to be exploited in quantum algorithms @xcite , and may have implications for biology and beyond @xcite .",
    "i thank carl williams at the national institute of standards and technology for early encouragement of this work , and william k. wootters for helpful discussions .",
