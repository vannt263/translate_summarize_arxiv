    "these results lead to the picture that cta102 harbors a highly relativistic jet .",
    "the source underwent a major radio flare from millimetre to centimetre wavelength during spring 2006 .",
    "we have analyzed the single - dish data available for this source and here we present results of our modeling of the spectral evolution during the radio flare .",
    "for our analysis of the 2006 radio flare in cta102 we used radio / mm light curves spanning from 4.8@xmath1 to 340@xmath1 . in order to obtain simultaneous spectra , we interpolated the observed light curves and performed a spectral analysis . within this analysis we subtracted a quiescent spectrum from the obtained data and fitted a self - absorbed spectrum , defined by @xmath4\\right\\}$ ] , where @xmath5 is the flux density , @xmath6 is the frequency at which the opacity @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spectral indices for the optically thick and optically thin parts of the spectrum , respectively . the turnover frequency , @xmath10 , and the turnover flux density , @xmath11 , can be calculated from the first and the second derivative of the synchrotron spectrum and they can be regarded as the characteristics of the spectrum .",
    "the uncertainties on the derived spectral values were obtained by performing monte carlo simulations .",
    "the derived spectral evolution showed a discrepancies from the standard evolution with in the shock - in - jet model ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* marscher & gear 1985 ) ) , visible as a second hump in the @xmath12 plane ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fromm 2009 ) ) .",
    "the shock - in - jet model assumes a power law relation between the turnover frequency , @xmath10 , and the turnover flux density , @xmath11 , where the exponent depends on the dominant energy loss mechanism ( compton , synchrotron and adiabatic ) and the evolution of the physical properties in the jet .",
    "the model assumes a power law distribution for the relativistic electrons , @xmath13 and the evolution of the constant @xmath14 follows the relation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the radius of the jet .",
    "furthermore the the evolution of the magnetic field can be expressed as @xmath17 , the evolution of the doppler factor is @xmath18 and of the jet radius , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 corresponds to the distance along the jet . applying this model to the derived spectral behaviour leads to the following results for the evolution of the physical quantities .",
    "the evolution of the parameter @xmath21 ( jet opening ) could be an indication for a non - pressure matched jet and the behaviour of the power law index @xmath22 could be interpreted as a re - acceleration of relativistic particles . together with the variation in the magnetic field @xmath23 and the doppler factor @xmath24 our result could be associated with a traveling - standing shock interaction .",
    "standing shocks are common features in non - pressure matched jets . at the position of the standing shock , the traveling shock will encounter a region of increased particle density and magnetic field strength and will generate , due to shock acceleration at the shock front , a higher emissivity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gmez et al . 1997 ) ) .",
    "this increase in the emissivity could lead to the observed spectral behaviour .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be presented elsewhere .",
    "future work should include the analysis of available multi - frequency vlbi observations in combination with relativistic magneto - hyrdodynamic simulations which could confirm our scenario of a shock - shock interaction in cta102 ."
