    "the order parameter distribution function has been proved to be a powerful tool for studying not only magnetic systems @xcite , but also the liquid - gas critical point @xcite , the critical point in the unified theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions@xcite , and the critical point in quantum chromodynamics@xcite . for the specific case of magnetic systems",
    "the order parameter can be chosen as the magnetization per spin , namely @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total number of spins and @xmath2 is the spin at site @xmath3 .",
    "in finite - size systems , the magnetization @xmath4 is a fluctuating quantity , characterized by the probability distribution @xmath5 @xcite . in ising - like models undergoing a second - order phase transition",
    "it is known that at temperatures lower than the critical temperature @xmath6 , the distribution @xmath5 has a double peak , centered at the spontaneous magnetizations @xmath7 and @xmath8 . at temperatures greater than @xmath6",
    ", @xmath5 has a single peak at zero magnetization , and exactly at @xmath6 a double - peak shape is observed@xcite .",
    "analogously to the usual finite - size scaling assumptions @xcite , one then expects that , for a large finite system of linear dimension @xmath9 at the critical point , @xmath5 takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are critical exponents , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a constant , and @xmath16 is a universal scaling function , normalized to unit norm and unit variance . scaling functions , such as @xmath17 , are characteristic of the corresponding universality class .",
    "systems belonging to the same universality class share the same scaling functions .",
    "thus , from the precise knowledge of @xmath16 one can characterize critical points and also identify universality classes .",
    "this is what has been done so far in the literature , with the distribution for the spin-1/2 ising model being the standard @xmath17 function@xcite for this universality class .",
    "for instance , it is shown in fig .",
    "[ spins1 - 3 ] the normalized distribution @xmath16 for the two - dimensional spin-1/2 , spin-1 , and spin-3/2 ising model at criticality .",
    "simulations have been done on square lattices with @xmath18 at the exact @xmath6 for spin-1/2 , at @xmath19 for spin-1 , according series expansions @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite , and at @xmath20 for the spin-3/2 model @xcite . the universal aspect of these systems can be easily noted .    scaling function @xmath16 for the two - dimensional spin-1/2 , spin-1 , and spin-3/2 ising model on square lattices with @xmath18 .",
    "simulations were performed at the exact @xmath6 for spin-1/2 , at @xmath19 for spin-1 , according series expansions @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite , and at @xmath20 for the spin-3/2 model @xcite .",

    "( [ pm ] ) one has to evaluate the pre - factor @xmath24 .",
    "this can be easily done by noting that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the square root of the magnetization variance ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , one obtains the universal function @xmath16 by simply rescaling the magnetization and by using eq .",
    "( [ pm ] ) .    in general ,",
    "the probability distribution is used for studying models in which the critical temperature or even the distribution function is exactly ( or high - precisely ) known .",
    "that is in fact what has been done in the study of several systems .",
    "when this distribution , as well as the critical temperature and critical exponents , are not known , one can of course do first a canonical simulation in order to get the critical values ( universal and non universal ) and compute , afterwards , the desired distribution .",
    "the present approach is different from this conventional one in the sense that it does use the order parameter distribution itself in order to obtain the criticality of the system .",
    "the procedure , as well as the results obtained for the spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising model , are discussed in section ii and the conclusions are presented in the final section .",
    "we have performed extensive monte carlo simulations ( up to @xmath28 monte carlo steps per spin after @xmath29 steps for thermalization ) on square @xmath30 lattices with periodic boundary conditions for systems of length @xmath31 . for a given @xmath9 ,",
    "the simulation ran at a fixed temperature , evolving according the standard metropolis algorithm . a histogram reweighting technique @xcite was used to obtain thermodynamic information in the vicinity of the simulated temperature .",
    "let us first discuss the spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the distribution @xmath17 as a function of the normalized magnetization @xmath32 for temperatures different from the critical value @xmath6 .",
    "as expected , one can see that for a temperature lower than @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) , the maximum value of @xmath17 increases when the lattice size @xmath9 increases , while for a temperature greater than @xmath6 , an increase of @xmath9 leads to a decrease of the corresponding peaks of @xmath17 ( see fig . [",

    "analogously , if @xmath42 , we will have @xmath43 .",

    "[ fig4]a , we have a plot of @xmath45 vs. @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , using the values of the first five columns of table [ tab1 ] , which confirms the exact exponent @xmath47 and gives @xmath51 .",

    "linear regression gives @xmath53 for the infinite system , which is in fact quite close to the exact one .    in order to measure the applicability of the present mechanism for obtaining the transition temperature from non - universal distributions",
    ", we also study the spin-1 ising model .",
    "to have an idea of the value of @xmath6 , one just performs short simulations in a range of temperatures to check whether the probability distribution @xmath5 has single or double peak .",
    "then , one proceeds according to the same manner already discussed for the spin-1/2 case .",
    "we fix the temperature and verify how the peaks of the distribution change if the lattice size @xmath9 increases .",
