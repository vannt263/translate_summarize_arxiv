    "when @xmath14 then the latter two convex cones coincide with the cone @xmath15 $ ] of sums of squares ( s.o.s . ) of polynomials .",
    "the convex cones @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( which are subcones of the convex cone @xmath7 of polynomials nonnegative on @xmath1 ) are of practical importance because on the one hand nonnegative polynomials are ubiquitous but on the other hand , polynomials in @xmath10 or @xmath11 are much easier to handle .",
    "for instance , and in contrast with nonnegative polynomials , checking whether a given polynomial is in @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( i.e. , with an _ a priori _ degree bound @xmath18 on its representation ) can be done efficiently by solving a semidefinite program , a powerful technique of convex optimization .",
    "the celebrated @xmath1-moment problem is concerned with characterizing all real sequences @xmath19 , @xmath20 , which can be realized as the moment sequence of some finite borel measure on @xmath1 . for such sequences @xmath21 , the linear form @xmath22 associated with @xmath21",
    "is called a _",
    "@xmath1-moment functional _ and haviland s theorem states that @xmath22 is a @xmath1-moment functional if and only if @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "and so one says that @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath11 ) solves the @xmath1-moment problem if the @xmath1-moment functionals are those which satisfy @xmath25 on @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath11 ) .",
    "however , this is true if and only if @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath11 ) is dense in @xmath7 for the finest locally convex topology on @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath1 is compact , the @xmath1-moment problem was completely solved ( with @xmath26 ) in schmdgen @xcite and soon refined to @xmath27 in putinar @xcite for archimedean quadratic modules @xmath11 .    since then , recent contributions have tried to better understand ( in even a more general framework ) the links between @xmath7 and closures ( and sequential closures ) of preorderings and quadratic modules , one important goal being to extend ( or provide analogues of ) schmdgen and putinar s positivstellensatz @xcite to cases where @xmath1 is not compact . in particular ,",
    "scheiderer @xcite has shown rather negative results in this direction . for more details on those recent results , the interested",

    "@xcite , and cimpric et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the one hand , _ all _ linear functionals are continuous in the finest locally convex topology , on the other hand , the negative results of scheiderer @xcite suggest that solving the @xmath1-moment problem via preorderings or quadratic modules is possible only in specific cases , and so this topology is not the most appropriate in general .",
    "so why not rather consider other topologies on @xmath4 $ ] and the @xmath1-moment problem for linear functionals @xmath22 that are _ continuous _ for these topologies ?",
    "this is the point of view taken in ghasemi et al .",

    "* contribution .",
    "* in view of the negative results in scheiderer @xcite , we also consider the above mentioned viewpoint and look at the @xmath1-moment problem by using a particular weighted @xmath2-norm on @xmath4 $ ] ( denoted @xmath3 for a certain sequence @xmath30 ) rather than the usual finest locally convex topology . in this framework",
    "we solve the @xmath1-moment problem for basic closed semi - algebraic sets @xmath0 in the following sense .",
    "we prove that ( a ) the @xmath3-closure of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is exactly @xmath7 , and ( b ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 solve the moment problem , i.e. , the @xmath1-moment ( @xmath3-continuous ) functionals are those @xmath22 that are @xmath3-continuous and nonnegative on @xmath11 ( or @xmath10 ) .",

    "in addition , the support is very sparse since @xmath44 .",
    "this confirms the property of the @xmath2-norm with respect to sparsity , already observed in other contexts . minimizing the @xmath2-norm aims at finding a solution with small support ( where @xmath45 ) .",
    "finally , the vector @xmath46 in ( [ simpleform ] ) is an optimal solution of an explicit semidefinite program , and so can be computed efficiently .",
