    "we have applied a jensen - feynman path - integral type calculation to the case of the impurity in a condensate and derived expression ( [ result ] ) for the free energy .",
    "both in the free energy and the effective mass , a critical value of the coupling strength @xmath148 can be identified where the system crosses over from the weak - coupling to the strong - coupling regime .",
    "these regimes show a qualitatively different behavior of the effective mass and free energy .",
    "the sharp increase in the the effective mass in the strong - coupling regime hints at a transition from an quasi - free state to a large - mass state similar to that for acoustic polarons .",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite that a transition from the quasi - free regime to the large - mass regime is impossible to realize in most semiconductors and iii - v compounds , even in alkali halides .",
    "however , the present results indicate that it might be attainable in ultracold gases . for this purpose ,",
    "we investigated the experimentally relevant values of the system parameters , and derived a useful expression ( [ alpha ] ) relating @xmath83 to the various parameters in the case of a condensate in the thomas - fermi regime .",
    "this opens up the prospect to reach and investigate the strong - coupling regime in ultracold gases , whereas this regime has hitherto be inaccessible in the solid state .",

    "<S> the description of an impurity atom in a bose - einstein condensate can be cast in the form of frhlich s polaron hamiltonian , where the bogoliubov excitations play the role of the phonons . </S>",
    "<S> an expression for the corresponding polaronic coupling strength is derived , relating the coupling strength to the scattering lengths , the trap size and the number of bose condensed atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to identify several approaches to reach the strong - coupling limit for the quantum gas polarons , whereas this limit was hitherto experimentally inaccessible in solids . </S>",
    "<S> we apply feynman s path - integral method to calculate for all coupling strengths the polaronic shift in the free energy and the increase in the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of temperature on these quantities is included in the description . </S>",
    "<S> we find similarities to the acoustic polaron results and indications of a transition between free polarons and self - trapped polarons . </S>",
    "<S> the prospects , based on the current theory , of investigating the polaron physics with ultracold gases are discussed for lithium atoms in a sodium condensate . </S>"
