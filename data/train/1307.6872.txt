    "matter - wave solitons are an important class of nonlinear excitations in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "they are coherent , spatially localized solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) resulting from a balance between linear dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "moreover , they are the atomic analogs of the optical solitons of nonlinear optics , with which they share many similarities @xcite . this analogy has proved to be very fruitful and has stimulated much theoretical and experimental work in the field of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "a particular example of the interplay between the two fields which have attracted considerable attention in recent years is that of matter - wave gap solitons @xcite .",
    "these solitons , first observed experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , are localized nonlinear structures which can be realized in becs loaded in one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices , and are characterized by a chemical potential lying in the forbidden band gaps of the underlying lineal problem .",
    "most theoretical treatments of matter - wave gap solitons in 1d optical lattices have been carried out in a 1d setting @xcite .",
    "this approximation is justified when the condensate is subject to a transversal confinement so strong that its radial dynamics is frozen to the zero - point quantum fluctuations of the corresponding ground state . under such circumstances ,",
    "the axial dynamics can be accurately described in terms of the 1d gpe . however , as the transversal confinement decreases or the condensate density increases , the contribution from higher - order radial modes becomes more and more important so that transversal excitations can no longer be neglected @xcite .",
    "this situation occurs frequently in practice .    in general ,",
    "the study and characterization of matter - wave dark or gap solitons proceeds in different and well separated stages @xcite .",
    "the first step consists in establishing the existence of such nonlinear solutions which , for solitons with a nontrivial radial configuration , requires solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem associated with the three - dimensional ( 3d ) gpe .",
    "this is a complex problem which is commonly addressed numerically by using a newton continuation method in terms of the chemical potential of the condensate . in a subsequent step one usually is interested in the stability properties of the nonlinear states previously found .",
    "such properties can be determined from a linear stability analysis based on the numerical solution of the bogoliubov  de gennes equations or by monitoring the long - time behavior of the condensate after a sudden small perturbation , which in turn requires the numerical integration of the equations of motion . in a final stage ,",
    "one may be interested in the stabilization of certain unstable solutions , for instance , by changing the system configuration , the number of particles , or by introducing convenient pinning potentials or even a second component with repulsive interspecies interactions .",
    "in general , the different stages of the analysis have to be tackled separately by using different specific computational techniques .",
    "in what follows we will focus on the first stage . more specifically",
    ", we will be interested in the search for axially localized nonlinear stationary solutions of the 3d gpe exhibiting a higher - order radial configuration .",
    "while , in principle , this is a 3d problem where both axial and radial degrees of freedom can play an equally relevant role @xcite , we will show in this work that , rather unexpectedly , it can be addressed in terms of an equivalent effective problem of lower dimensionality .",
    "such dimensionality reduction is particularly interesting because the computational complexity of a newton continuation method increases rapidly as one passes from 1d to 3d .",
    "effective equations of reduced dimensionality have proven to be a valuable tool in the description of becs in highly anisotropic geometries .",
    "this class of systems , which can be realized by applying a strong confinement potential in one or two spatial directions , has received considerable attention in recent years @xcite . in particular",
    ", they are especially relevant for applications of trapped bose condensates in matter - wave interferometry @xcite or in generation and manipulation of matter - wave dark @xcite and gap solitons @xcite .",
    "since highly anisotropic potentials induce two very different time scales in the condensate dynamics , in these systems the computational effort of a fully 3d treatment can become prohibitively high @xcite .",
    "this is so due to the fact that in order to guarantee the convergence of the numerical procedure one has to accurately resolve the fast degrees of freedom even though very often only the slow ones are relevant .",
    "fortunately , the dynamics of dilute quantum gases tightly confined in the radial or the axial direction becomes effectively one dimensional or two dimensional , respectively , which allows for a description of the condensate dynamics in terms of effective equations of lower dimensionality .",
    "a number of such low - dimensional equations have been proposed @xcite . especially relevant because of their simplicity and practical usefulness in realistic situations",
    "are those derived in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that they can also be obtained from a variational approach based , respectively , on the appropriate energy and chemical - potential functionals @xcite .",
    "several variants and extensions of the above two latter equations has also been proposed @xcite . for highly elongated condensates",
    ", it has been shown that , within their range of applicability , the effective equations derived in refs . @xcite and @xcite can accurately reproduce the experimental results @xcite .",
    "in fact , unlike what happens with the standard 1d gpe ( which is a nonlinear schrdinger equation with a cubic nonlinearity ) , the above mentioned effective equations can account properly for the contribution of transversal excitations on the axial dynamics of the condensate through a nonpolynomial nonlinear term .",
    "for this reason , they are particularly well suited for modeling trapped condensates in the dimensional crossover regime between 1d and 3d , a regime which is especially relevant in the study of matter - wave nonlinear structures such as dark and gap solitons .",
    "interestingly , the effective equations derived in this work are a natural generalization of the effective equations of refs . @xcite and @xcite to the case where the condensate exhibits a nontrivial higher - order transversal configuration . while stationary ringlike transversal excitations have been studied previously ( both theoretically and experimentally ) @xcite in becs axially confined by a harmonic trapping potential ( where the axial degrees of freedom play no relevant role ) , here",
    "we are mainly concerned with a quite different situation , where , in addition to a nontrivial radial configuration , the condensates feature a localized self - trapped nonlinear structure along the axial direction ( such as occurs , for instance , in the case of matter - wave gap solitons in the weak - radial - confinement regime @xcite ) . in such circumstances ,",
    "the axial degrees of freedom play as important role as the radial ones and thus must be explicitly incorporated in the physical description . as we will demonstrate , the effective equations derived in this work permit one to solve such an essentially 3d problem in terms of an equivalent 1d problem whose computational cost is similar to that corresponding to solving the standard 1d gpe .",
    "in the mean - field regime , the physics of dilute bose - einstein condensates at zero temperature , in a confining potential @xmath5 , is completely characterized by a macroscopic wave function @xmath6 that satisfies the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of atoms , and @xmath9 is the interaction strength determined by the _ s_-wave scattering length @xmath10 .",
    "equation ( [ r-7 ] ) has been proven to accurately reproduce the dynamics of mean - field becs under realistic experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to look for a simpler effective equation of lower dimensionality which , under certain conditions , permit us to find good approximate solutions of the equation above . to this end , we start by assuming the adiabatic approximation to be applicable .",
    "more specifically , we shall assume that the axial degrees of freedom evolve so slowly in time in comparison with the transverse degrees of freedom that , at every instant @xmath11 , the latter ones can relax almost instantaneously to a stationary state compatible with the axial configuration . under these circumstances ,",
    "correlations between axial and radial motions are negligible and the wave function can be factorized in the form @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the axial linear density,@xmath15 in the above equations , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been normalized to unity .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the trajectory in the @xmath122-@xmath8 plane characterizing the family of @xmath123 gap solitons , where @xmath122 stands for the dimensionless chemical potential @xmath124 . the solid red line is the result obtained from the effective 1d model ( [ iii-2 ] ) while open circles have been obtained from the numerical solution of the full 3d gpe .",
    "both results agree to within @xmath125 . in this and",
    "the following figures the horizontal gray strips represent the spectral bands of the underlying linear problem .",
    "the first seven ( narrow ) strips are different 3d replicas corresponding to the axial band index @xmath126 [ only the quantum numbers @xmath0 are represented in the figures ] .",
    "the uppermost ( wide ) strip is the @xmath127 spectral band . in the insets we present an example of a soliton of this family with @xmath128 particles .",
    "the soliton wave function as obtained from the effective 1d model ( [ iii-2 ] ) is shown in panels ( a ) in terms of an isosurface of the atom density taken at @xmath93 of its maximum ( right panel ) and a color map of  the local phase ( left panel ) .",
    "panels ( b ) show the corresponding results as obtained from the 3d gpe .",
    "the field of view in each panel is @xmath129 @xmath80 m @xmath130 @xmath129 @xmath80 m .",
    "gap solitons in this family are stationary disk - shaped condensates located at a single lattice site and featuring a central vortex of unit charge . while condensates with a similar look have been extensively studied in systems confined in the axial direction by a strong harmonic potential , it is important to note that gap solitons are completely different in nature .",
    "they are self - trapped nonlinear waves ( bright solitons ) resulting from an interplay between nonlinearity and periodicity which bifurcate from the linear bloch bands and thus reside in the band gaps of the lattice spectrum .",
    "in particular , @xmath123 gap solitons are stationary states of the gpe featuring a vortex of unit charge in the transversal direction in addition to a ( bright ) gap soliton in the axial direction .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] displays the distinctive @xmath131 curve of the@xmath132 family .",
    "even though in this case the prediction from the effective 1d model ( [ iii-2 ] ) ( solid red line ) is somewhat less accurate than before , it still agrees with the 3d results ( open circles ) to within @xmath133 . as can be seen in the insets , the transversal profile of gap solitons in this family exhibit a concentric ring of zero density associated with a @xmath100-phase shift along the radial direction .",
    "finally , predictions for the @xmath134 and @xmath135 fundamental families are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , respectively .",
    "gap solitons of type @xmath134 are self - trapped stationary states of the gpe featuring a central unit - charge vortex in addition to a concentric zero - density ring , while those of the @xmath135 family exhibit two concentric rings of zero density . as the figures reflect , the threshold chemical potentials for these families are greater than the previous ones .",
    "it is also apparent that the predicted @xmath131 curves ( solid red lines ) are in excellent agreement with the exact numerical 3d results ( open circles ) , being the error involved less than @xmath136 in both cases .",
    "figures [ fig4][fig7 ] also show that the effective 1d model ( [ iii-2 ] ) is able to provide a rather good estimate for the corresponding 3d wave functions .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated that an important class of nonlinear stationary solutions of the 3d gpe in the weak - radial - confinement regime can be found and characterized in terms of an effective 1d model .",
    "this model provides us with a good approximate solution of the original 3d problem involving , however , a technical complexity and computational effort similar to that corresponding to the standard 1d gpe .    in the weak - radial - confinement regime",
    "the system energy is always large enough so that the 3d gpe admits stationary solutions exhibiting nontrivial higher - order transversal configurations . in order to address this problem in terms of an equivalent problem of lower dimensionality",
    "we have followed a variational approach based on both the energy and the chemical - potential functionals and have derived effective 1d equations that govern the axial dynamics of becs in @xmath0 transversal states , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being , respectively , the axial angular momentum and the radial quantum numbers .",
    "such states feature a central vortex of charge @xmath1 as well as @xmath2 concentric zero - density rings at every @xmath3 plane .",
    "interestingly , even though the equations derived in this work generalize previous proposals to the more complicated case of condensates exhibiting nontrivial 3d configurations , their functional forms are universal , which is a consequence of the fact that the specifics of the transversal dynamics can be absorbed in the renormalization of a couple of parameters ( @xmath49 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "this permits the study of systems of increasing complexity with the same computational effort .",
    "the model proposed finds its principal application in those situations where one is primarily concerned with the existence and classification of axially localized nonlinear stationary states in a weak - radial - confinement regime . in these cases the numerical solution of the effective 1d problem provides an accurate prediction for the axial density profile and the chemical potential of the 3d condensate and gives a good estimate for the corresponding 3d wave function as well .",
    "in particular , the model proves to be a valuable tool in the study of the existence and classification of 3d gap solitons supported by 1d optical lattices , where it is able to make very good predictions for the important @xmath131 curves , which are essential for characterizing the different fundamental families .",
    "matter - wave gap solitons in higher - order transversal states are of particular interest because they are a source for embedded gap solitons and , more importantly , they either are stable or are expected to be easily stabilized . in fact , it has been shown that @xmath137 gap solitons are stable even in the weak - radial - confinement regime @xcite .",
    "the same occurs with the family @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "gap solitons of type @xmath138 with @xmath139 can be stabilized by simply changing their particle content @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that becs with a transversal profile similar to that of the family @xmath140 , confined in a pancake trap , can be stabilized by adding a second component @xcite . since the instability of the @xmath140 family is purely transversal in nature , the same is expected to occur in the case of gap solitons .",
    "this strategy could also be used to stabilize gap solitons of type @xmath141 .",
    "alternatively , specifically engineered pinning potentials might also be used to this purpose @xcite .",
    "while a detailed stability analysis of these nonlinear structures is of great interest , it requires a separate study with specific computational techniques , distinct from those required for their generation and characterization .",
    "such an analysis , which is beyond the scope of this work , will be the subject of a future publication .",
