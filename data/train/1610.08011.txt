    "absorption is a major issue in acoustics and wave physics in general .",
    "the design of a perfect absorber is not a trivial matter since a twofold problem should be tackled . on one hand ,",
    "the absorbent should present a perfect impedance matching in order to eliminate the sound reflection and , on the other hand , it should also have the amount of losses to absorb the energy of the wave without changing the impedance matching condition .",
    "more precisely , one can consider a perfect absorber as a lossy material that absorbs all the incoming waves ( independent of its frequency and the impinging direction ) , whose impedance perfectly matches the surrounding media , avoiding the reflection .",
    "perfect absorption ( pa ) is recently receiving an increasing interest @xcite .    chirped or graded materials are widely used in the wave physics community due to their possibilities to manipulate the wave propagation .",
    "these artificial materials are emerging as promising tools for potential applications in several branches of research and technology @xcite .",
    "several applications for focusing@xcite , trapping @xcite , bending waves @xcite , opening of wide full band gaps @xcite and controlling the spatial dispersion beams in reflection @xcite have been developed .",
    "recently , some of us presented a system with acoustic wave enhancement due to the progressive decrease of the group velocity along the propagation direction @xcite",
    ". chirped structures have also been used as efficiently absorbers . in the electromagnetic counterpart , an omnidirectional absorber has received a significant attention recently .",
    "it was shown that nearly total angle absorption of incident waves can be achieved using a cylindrical or a spherical device comprised of an absorbing core surrounded by a layer with dielectric constant varying with the distance @xmath0 to the device center @xcite .",
    "the structure captures the incident radiation and guides it towards the absorbing core where the energy is dissipated . at the boundary between this layer and the absorbing core a nearly perfect impedance matching is achieved as well as at the air / layer interface , so the reflections are minimized .",
    "acoustic analogues of this omnidirectional light absorber that works for airborne sound have been also proposed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on a 1d chirped multi - layer porous material .",
    "this system , contrary to the previous absorbing acoustic materials based on graded structures , does not has an absorbing core . by progressively varying the acoustical properties along the incident direction",
    ", the structure presents a quasi impedance matching condition that allows the penetration of the wave without reflection .",
    "as the waves propagate inside the material , the intrinsic viscothermal losses of the porous layers absorb the waves .",
    "the losses are tuned by changing the thickness of the porous layers , in such a way that the intrinsic losses compensate the leakage of the system , accordingly to the critical coupling condition .",
    "this activates the perfect absorption .",
    "we use the theoretical framework provided by the transfer and scattering matrix formulation in order to study the reflection and transmission properties of the system . by using the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix in the complex frequency plane @xcite ,",
    "the intrinsic losses can be determined in order to compensate the leakage of the system to produce prefect absorption conditions .",
    "the chirped multi - layer porous material analyzed in this work behaves as a resonant fabry - prot cavity .",
    "its resonances present a very low quality factor and they overlap to create a broadband unidirectional perfect absorber .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",

    "the structure made of @xmath28 layers has a total length of @xmath29 cm .",
    "it is worth noting here that the optimization of the geometrical parameters of the structure plays a fundamental role in the absorption of the system . on one hand ,",
