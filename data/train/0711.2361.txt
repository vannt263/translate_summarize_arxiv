    "<S> a shape evolution of @xmath0yb in yrast states is traced using the self - consistent skyrme hartree - fock calculations . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the disappearance of one of the octupole vibrational modes in the rotating frame gives rise to the nonaxial octupole deformations in @xmath3yb , while the octupole modes are nonzero in @xmath4yb .    </S>",
    "<S> shell structure plays a prominent role in the formation of ground and excited nuclear states . </S>",
    "<S> it is crucially important at fast rotation , when nuclear stability against fission is determined by a delicate balance of different constituents of a nuclear potential . in a geometrical approach @xcite , where the concept of shape deformation is one of the basic cornerstones , </S>",
    "<S> effects produced by quadrupole degrees of freedom are well understood for various effective potentials . </S>",
    "<S> whether octupole degrees of freedom are of any importance and how they are manifested, these questions stimulate a noticeable fraction of experimental efforts in high spin physics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> numerous calculations exploiting the intrinsic reflection symmetry breaking of a nuclear mean field predict the existence of stable axial octupole deformation in the ground state for ra - th @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and ba - sm @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) nuclei , where strong octupole instability is due to the coupling of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy surface produced by different calculations is , however , quite shallow . </S>",
    "<S> experimental nuclear spectra also show a pronounced parity splitting at low angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> rather dynamical octupole effects ( vibrations ) are dominant over static effects ( octupole deformations ) at low spins . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the angular momentum decreases pairing correlations which reduce the octupole interaction , since they couple the orbitals with the same parity . with rotation , the density of different parity states is enhancing markedly near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one observes a smooth decrease of the parity splitting with the increase of the rotational frequency fairly in a few nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> these features are nicely reproduced within the cranking+hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach with gogny forces in ba - sm region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar calculations with skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite forces predict a nonaxial @xmath1 octupole deformation in light nuclei at high spins . </S>",
    "<S> the results based on the skyrme interaction demonstrate the importance of a nonaxial @xmath12 octupole deformation in actinide nuclei at fast rotation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that rotation induces the contribution of nonaxial quadrupole and octupole components of effective nuclear potentials .    a wealth of experimental information accumulated in the past few years on high spin states in the transitional nuclei @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath14 prompted us to investigate the question to what extent dynamical octupole effects observed at low spins in this mass region might develop static octupole deformations at sufficiently high angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this is a main subject of this letter .    to analyse the rotational evolution of equilibrium deformations we have employed the hfodd code @xcite . in the present calculations </S>",
    "<S> the pairing correlations are neglected , since they are not expected to play an important role at large rotational frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> our hf calculations based on the cranked skyrme skp interaction ( see details in ref . ) </S>",
    "<S> demonstrate that a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon occurs in @xmath3yb at large rotational frequencies ( see fig.1 ) .         and </S>",

    "<S> both the minimal solutions are very close to each other , while the pure quadrupole one determines properties of yrast states at fast rotation . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , @xmath19 means the averaging over the mean field vacuum ( yrast ) state at a given rotational frequency @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a similar pattern with the skiii parametrisation , which conforms our main finding , however , with slightly higher values of the energy minima . at slow rotation @xmath21mev ( when pairing is important ) </S>",
    "<S> the results should be taken cautiously , while the calculations provide a most credible tendency at @xmath22mev .    a transparent physical idea </S>",
    "<S> that an instability of a nuclear potential with respect to a given deformation implies a softening of the corresponding vibrational mode @xcite enables us to shed light on the mean field results . </S>",
    "<S> the cranked shell model that incorporates a random phase approximation ( rpa ) represents a powerful tool to illuminate dynamics of various correlations , evolving from shape fluctuations ( vibrations ) to a nuclear shape instability . </S>",
    "<S> we use a crpa approach @xcite that consists in a self - consistent solution of the cranked nilsson potential for the yrast line and analysis of the low - lying excitations near the yrast line in the rpa . </S>",
    "<S> our consideration is based on the hamiltonian @xmath23 the term @xmath24 contains the nilsson hamiltonian @xmath25 with quadrupole deformations and the additional term that restores the local galilean invariance of the nilsson potential , broken in the rotating frame . to describe different parity states , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction @xmath26 includes separable monopole pairing , monopole - monopole , quadrupole - quadrupole and spin - spin terms for the positive parity @xmath27 and dipole - dipole , octupole - octupole terms for the negative parity @xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> they are expressed in terms of doubly stretched coordinates @xmath34 , which ensure the self - consistent conditions at the equilibrium deformation . </S>",
    "<S> all the details of this approach are thoroughly discussed in ref .. although the crpa approach is based on the nilsson potential , it contains static and dynamic effects induced by rotation and serves a useful purpose of independent view of the skyrme results .    </S>",
    "<S> the mode associated with the rotation about the @xmath35-axis determines the thouless - valatin moment of inertia @xmath36 @xmath37= \\frac{\\hat j_x}{\\cal j_{tv } } , \\quad [ { \\hat \\phi},{\\hat j}_x]=i.\\ ] ] here , @xmath38 is the positive signature term of the full hamiltonian ; an angle operator @xmath39 is the canonical partner of the angular momentum operator @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of these equations leads to the definition @xmath41 where the matrix a(b ) has a dimension @xmath42 due to a coupling of different operators involved in @xmath38 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that a comparison of the dynamical moment of inertia @xmath43 @xmath44 ) with the thouless - valatin @xmath45 moment of inertia calculated in the rpa provides a faithful test of the self - consistency of a cranking microscopic theory . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between these momenta of inertia certainly holds , if one found a self - consistent mean field minimum and spurious solutions are separated from the physical ones ( see exact results for a solvable model in ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the phenomenological rotational dependence of the gap parameter near the backbending region ( see ref . ) , the @xmath46 and @xmath47 terms of the nilsson potential affect this equivalence . </S>",

    "<S> it should be emphasized that the potential - energy surfaces are very shallow . </S>",
    "<S> the deformations shown in fig.3 should be not taken as precise predictions , since even before the transition point the yrast states may possess small @xmath92 @xmath56-deformation ( see also refs . ) . to elucidate the structure near the transition point we trace the rotational evolution of the crpa solutions and the lowest two - quasiparticle poles . at @xmath93 </S>",

    "<S> yb . </S>",
    "<S> similar to fig.4 . ]    from fig.4 ( bottom panel , right ) one observes that the first negative signature and parity rpa ( octupole ) solution tends to zero . </S>",
    "<S> almost a zero energy gap between the negative parity band ( b5 ) and the yrast line is also observed at @xmath100mev . </S>",
    "<S> the collectivity of the lowest negative parity rpa solutions of both signatures increases noticeably with the increase of the rotational frequency . </S>",
    "<S> results for reduced @xmath67- and @xmath87-transition probabilities evidently demonstrate the onset of octupole correlations at @xmath101mev ( see fig.5 ) . </S>",

    "<S> similar to fig.5 . ]    in @xmath4yb ( see fig.6 ) , there are observed 15 rotational bands so far @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the negative signature family ( with odd spins ) includes b2 , b12 , b13 , b14 , and b6 , b7 , b15 of positive and negative parity bands , respectively . at @xmath112mev </S>",
    "<S> the band b11 crosses the ground band b1 . </S>",
    "<S> this crossing gives rise to the backbending ( see fig.3 ) . according to our analysis , </S>",
    "<S> the first positive parity and signature rpa solution ( see fig.6 , top left panel ) may be identified with @xmath56-excitations at small rotation @xmath94mev . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation induces a strong mixing between @xmath56-and @xmath55-excitations ( the second rpa solution at low spins ) . although the pattern is similar to the one of @xmath3yb , @xmath55- and @xmath113 vibrations are interchanged at small rotation . at @xmath114mev the transition from an axial to nonaxial rotations is determined by two - quasiparticle neutron component from @xmath98 subshell . </S>",
    "<S> a good agreement between data and our results implies that quadrupole degrees of freedom dominate in this domain of rotational frequency values . </S>",
    "<S> the negative parity rpa solutions of both signatures ( see fig.6 ) decrease with the rotational frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the rpa results reproduce with a good accuracy the rotational behaviour of the negative parity states , especially , the lowest one . while the octupole phonons are of collective nature ( the maximal component is @xmath115 ) , the quadrupole deformed field remains stable , even at very high spins . </S>",
    "<S> the growing octupole collectivity is exhibited in the increasing dipole and octupole transitions from the negative - parity one phonon states at @xmath116mev ( see fig.7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath102-transition probability increases from @xmath117 w.u . at @xmath104 mev to @xmath118 w.u . at @xmath106 mev . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with @xmath3yb , all negative parity solutions are nonzero at @xmath119mev . </S>",
    "<S> octupole correlations are unable to break the reflection symmetry in @xmath4yb , which elucidates the result of skyrme calculations ( see fig.1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , we found that the internal structure of the low - lying excited ( @xmath72 , @xmath80 ) band , which crosses the ground band , has almost a pure two - quasiparticle character originating from @xmath98 neutron subshell , in agreement with the prediction of the phenomenological analysis @xcite . in both nuclei </S>",
    "<S> the rotation produces a profound affect on shell structure inducing noticeable octupole correlations at high spins . at @xmath116mev </S>",
    "<S> we predict the formation of octupole bands with strong @xmath67- and @xmath87- transitions to the yrast line ( see figs.5,7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that at @xmath120mev the octupole phonon solution vanishes in the rotating frame in @xmath3yb . </S>",
    "<S> it results in the onset of the degeneracy between the lowest negative parity and negative signature band and the positive parity and positive signature yrast line . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism explains the spontaneous breaking of reflection symmetry of the rotating mean field with skyrme interaction ( see fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in @xmath4yb the octupole correlations manifest themselves as a low - lying octupole vibrations of the quadrupole deformed rotating nucleus , in agreement with the skyrme results . </S>"
