    "we present the corrected values of apparent albedo in table  3 and figure  3 .",

    "significantly , apart from a 20 - 30% uniform offset , the polar and equatorial observations have indistinguishable albedo spectra .",

    "@xcite , we found substantial variability in all wavebands ( though the near - ir wavebands exhibited the most variability , leading to the dominant red eigencolor ) .",
    "the polar observations also show variability at all wavebands ( table  2 ) , but as we argue below , the intrinsic cause of this variability is not necessarily the same surface types rotating in and out of view .",
    "the multiband , time - resolved observations of earth can be thought of as a locus of points occupying a 7-dimensional parameter space ( one for each waveband ) . principal component analysis ( pca ) allows us to reduce the dimensionality of these data by defining orthonormal eigenvectors in color space ( a.k.a .",
    "eigencolors ) .",
    "quantitatively , the observed spectrum of earth at some time @xmath3 can be recovered using the equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the time - averaged spectrum of earth , @xmath6 are the seven orthonormal eigencolors , and @xmath7 are the instantaneous projections of earth s colors on the eigencolors .",
    "the terms in the sum are ranked by the time - variance in @xmath8 , from largest to smallest .",
    "insofar as the color variations are dominated by the first few terms of the sum , the locus does not occupy the full 7-dimensional color space , but a more restricted manifold .",
    "the dimensionality of the manifold is one fewer than the number of surface types rotating in and out of view .",
    "e.g. , a two - dimensional locus ( a planar manifold ) requires three surface types ; a three - dimensional locus requires four surface types , etc .",
    "the general problem of estimating the pure surface spectra based on the morphology of such a locus of points is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is a form of spectral unmixing , and is an area of active research in the remote sensing community ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in @xcite we used covariance - pca , and we continue to do so here .",
    "although pca is a mathematically and numerically robust technique for analyzing patterns in data , interpreting its results can be ambiguous . in particular , we would like to verify to what extent there is a one - to - one correspondence between the eigencolors output by the pca and real surfaces on earth . to this end , we test the pca routine on a suite of simulated data produced by the virtual planetary laboratory s validated 3d spectral earth model ( details can be found in robinson et al .",
    "the simulations used here were designed to closely mimic the earth1 epoxi observations taken in march 2008 .",
    "we run five different versions of the vpl 3d earth model : 1 ) standard : this model is an excellent fit to the epoxi earth1 observations ; the remaining models are identical , but in each case a single model element has been `` turned off '' : 2 ) cloud free ; 3 ) no rayleigh scattering ; 4 ) black oceans ; 5 ) black land .",

    "the presence of relatively cloud - free land ( deserts ) near the equator explains why the rotational map of the red eigencolor ( figure  10 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) successfully identified the major landforms and bodies of water on earth .",
    "\\4 ) oceans are essentially a null surface , contributing neither to the broadband colors of earth , nor to the time - variability of those colors , except insofar as the presence of oceans corresponds to a shortage of land .",
    "\\5 ) in the absence of land , the variability is gray , due to large - scale inhomogeneities in cloud cover .",
    "\\6 ) pca necessarily outputs orthogonal eigencolors and a good deal of earth s variability is due to clouds .",
    "therefore , if the first eigencolor is red , then the second eigencolor may be blue even if there is no blue surface rotating in and out of view ; this is an improvement on the interpretation of @xcite .      in figures  [ polar1_variability ] & [ polar2_variability ]",
    "we show the eigenvalue spectra for time - variations in the 7 eigencolors identified by the pca of the epoxi polar observations .",
    "the eigenvalue for a given component is the projection of the data s variance onto that eigenvector ; we plot here the square root of the eigenvalues , which is a measure of the rms variability of the data projected onto an eigenvector .",
    "the variability has been normalized in the figures such that the sum of the variability for all seven components is unity . by definition ,",
    "the low - order principal components have the largest variance .    for the north observation , there are two eigencolors that dominate the color variations of earth : the third eigencolor contributes only @xmath16% of the planet s color variability . as in @xcite",
    ", this means that the colors of earth populate a two - dimensional plane rather than filling the entire seven - dimensional color - space , and this requires at least three surface types .",
    "the southern observation , on the other hand , is dominated by a single eigencolor ( the second eigencolor contributes to variability at the @xmath17% level ) .",
    "this means that for the 24 hours of observations the colors of the planet populated a one - dimensional line in the seven - dimensional color volume , requiring only two surface types .",
    "the eigencolors ( the @xmath6 from equation  [ pca ] ) are shown in figures  [ polar1_eigenspectra ] & [ polar2_eigenspectra ] .",
    "the raw eigencolors are by definition orthogonal and normalized ( @xmath18 ) , and this is how we presented them in @xcite .",
    "here we have instead scaled the eigencolors by their associated eigenvalues ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the eigenvalue of the @xmath21th component ) , so the dominant components exhibit larger excursions from zero .",
    "the eigenprojections ( @xmath7 from equation  [ pca ] ) are shown in figures  [ polar1_eigenprojections ] & [ polar2_eigenprojections ] .",
    "the standard deviation of an eigenprojection corresponds to the variance or eigenvalue of that component . by definition ,",
    "the low - order eigenprojections have the largest deviations from 0 .",
    "note that in @xcite we instead plotted the normalized eigenprojections ( @xmath22 ) , which made it easier to compare the shapes of the eigenprojections but masked their relative importance .",
    "the north polar observations are dominated by two eigencolors . at first glance ,",
    "the two eigencolors are identical , only offset in the vertical direction , but they are ( by construction ) orthogonal .",
    "the more important of the two is blue , in that it is most non - zero at short wavelengths and nearly independent of what is going on at long wavelengths ; the second eigencolor is red : it is most non - zero at long wavelengths and is largely insensitive to variability in blue wavebands .",
    "based on the findings presented in ",
    "[ numerical_experiment ] , we may infer that clouds and continents are rotating in and out of view as seen from this vantage point .",
    "furthermore , cloud - related variability appears to be more important here than it was for the equatorial observations , which had a dominant red eigenvector followed by a blue , rather than vice - versa .",
    "the south polar observations are dominated by a single , gray eigencolor .",
    "snow and clouds both have gray optical albedo spectra , so either may be contributing to the photometric variability .",
    "the absence of an important red eigencolor is due to the relative dearth of continents in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the second eigencolor is two orders of magnitude down in variance , or one order of magnitude in variability .",
    "it indicates that red and blue surfaces are trading places as the world turns ( @xmath23 is positive at short wavelengths , negative at long wavelengths , and zero in between ) , but the forced orthogonality of the eigencolors makes this interpretation ambiguous .",

    "in this section we address how to infer the longitudinal color inhomogeneities of the unresolved planet based on time - resolved photometry .",
    "note that this is in principle an independent question from that of identifying surface types on the planet (   3 ) .",
    "one could try to infer the surface types on a planet without knowing or caring about their spatial distribution ; or one could simply produce longitudinal color maps while remaining agnostic about what these tell us about surfaces ( where `` surface '' here includes clouds ) . in practice ,",
    "however , the two are intimately tied : a planet only exhibits rotational variability if it has a variegated surface _ and _ substantial spatial inhomogeneities in the distribution of these surfaces .      as in @xcite",
    ", we wish to estimate disk - integrated cloud variability , as this imposes a limit on the accuracy of any rotational maps we create .",
    "after 24 hours of rotation the same hemisphere of earth should be facing the deep impact spacecraft , so the integrated brightness of the planet s surface should be nearly identical , provided one has accounted for the difference between the sidereal and solar day , as well as changes in the geocentric distance of the spacecraft and in the phase of the planet as seen from the spacecraft . even after correcting for",
    "all known geometric effects , the observed fluxes at the start and end of our observing campaigns differ by @xmath2436% and 0.41% for the north and south polar observing campaigns , respectively .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to diurnal changes in cloud cover .",
    "our 24-hour polar observation cloud variability of 4% and 1% , respectively is comparable to our estimate of cloud variability from previous epoxi earth observations ( 2% and 3% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and somewhat smaller than estimates from earthshine observations .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite found day - to - day cloud variations of roughly 5% and 10% , respectively . although we are still very much in the realm of small number statistics , it is conceivable that earthshine observations over - estimate diurnal changes in cloud cover : under - estimating night - to - night calibration errors would lead to over - estimating day - to - day cloud variability .",
    "depending on the size of the telescope and cloud meteorology for a given planet , either photon counting or cloud variability can dominate the error budget for rotational inversion .",
    "for the purposes of rotational mapping , we adopt effective gaussian errors in the apparent albedo of @xmath25 , comparable to the actual day - to - day cloud variability on earth .      using the formalism of @xcite , the visibility and illumination of a region on the planet at time @xmath3 are denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , where @xmath28 is the latitude and @xmath29 is the longitude on the planet s surface .",
    "@xmath30 is symmetric about the line - of - sight , is unity at the sub - observer point , drops as the cosine of the angle from the observer and is null on the far side of the planet from the observer ; @xmath31 is symmetric about the star ",
    "planet line , is unity at the sub - stellar point , drops as the cosine of the angle from the star and is null on the night - side of the planet .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we define the normalized weight , @xmath32 which quantifies which regions of the planet are contributing the most to the observed light curve , under the assumption of diffuse ( lambertian ) reflection .",
    "@xmath33 can be thought of as the smoothing kernel for the convolution between an albedo map , @xmath34 and an observed lightcurve , @xmath35 .",
    "to first order , the character of a lightcurve can be understood in terms of the shape and location of the weight function .",
    "the normalization ( denominator ) of the weight is a simple function of phase : @xmath36.\\ ] ]    as the planet rotates , @xmath33 sweeps from east to west .",
    "the width ( in longitude ) of the weight determines the longitudinal resolution achievable by inverting diurnal light curves : a broad @xmath33 at full phase leads to a coarser map than the slender @xmath33 of a crescent phase .",
    "this of course neglects the practical issues of inner working angles and photon counting noise .",
    "the peak of @xmath33 lies half - way between the sub - stellar and sub - observer points and corresponds to the location of the glint spot .",
    "the latitude of the glint spot may change throughout an orbit : the sub - observer latitude is fixed in the absence of precession , but the sub - solar latitude exhibits seasonal changes for non - zero obliquity .",
    "the peak of the weight is the area of the planet that contributes the most to the observed disc - integrated light curve .",
    "e.g. , a polar sub - observer latitude and an equatorial sub - stellar latitude would yield a weight with a maximum at mid - latitudes . in detail , @xmath33 is also tempered by the usual @xmath37 dependence of @xmath38 ( ie : there is more area near the equator than near the poles ) . the dominant latitude ( the latitude where the most photons would originate from in the case of a uniform lambert sphere ) is therefore not simply the peak of @xmath33 , but is rather the average @xmath28 , weighted by @xmath33 : @xmath39    in table  1 we list the dominant latitude for the four epoxi observations .",
    "significantly , the dominant latitude is temperate for the `` polar '' observations , despite the exotic viewing geometry .",
    "this simple argument explains why the time - averaged colors of the polar epoxi earth observations are so familiar : most of the photons will not originate from the snowy and icy regions of earth .",
    "that being said , the mid - latitudes probed by the polar observations are significantly more cloudy than the tropics ( yearly mean cloud cover in the tropics is 2550% , while at 45@xmath40  s cloud cover is 75100% ; see figure  6a of * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in appendix  i , clouds contribute a uniform ( gray ) increase in albedo of 2050% between the cloud - free and standard vpl models , so a latitudinal difference in cloud cover is a natural explanation for the observed difference in albedo .",
    "furthermore , polar snow and ice necessarily contribute more to the polar than the equatorial epoxi observations .",
    "for example , the earth1 and polar1 epoxi observations were both obtained at the same time of year ( march 2008 and 2009 , respectively ) , so we may meaningfully ask how the different viewing geometries affect the contribution from snowy regions . if the global - mean snowline for march lies at @xmath41n , we find that 2% of the weight is in snow - covered regions for the equatorial observation , while this fraction is 16% for the polar observation . in general , for global mean snow lines between 5060@xmath40n ,",
    "the snow - covered regions contribute 79 times more to the polar observation than to the equatorial observation .",
    "but such an argument is unlikely to work for the polar2 observation , which probes the relatively land - free southern oceans , and the time - averaged polar1 and polar2 broadband colors are indistinguishable .",
    "we therefore believe the increased weight of clouds to be the main source of the 2030% greater absolute value of @xmath42 in the polar observations compared to the equatorial observations .        in the top panel of figure  [ polar_earth_map ] , we show a map of land coverage on earth and indicate the sub - solar , sub - observer , and dominant latitudes for the north and south polar observations .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure shows the longitudinal land fraction profiles for the two polar observations , obtained by integrating the 2-d map by the weight function dictated by viewing geometry .",
    "it indicates the location of the major landforms probed by the polar observations and can be compared to the longitudinal profiles of eigencolors presented in the following section .",
    "the flux ratio primarily depends on the planet s orbital phase , the observer  planet  star angle , and the ratio @xmath43 .",
    "we define the apparent albedo , @xmath42 , as the ratio of the flux from the planet divided by the flux we would expect _ at the same phase _ for a perfectly reflecting lambert sphere ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this amounts to the average albedo of the planet , weighted by @xmath33 : @xmath44 a uniform planet would have an apparent albedo that is constant over a planetary rotation in the @xmath45 limit ; a uniform lambert sphere would further have a constant apparent albedo during the entire orbit . for non - transiting exoplanets , the planetary radius may be unknown , in which case @xmath42 can only be determined to within a factor of @xmath46 , with a lower limit on the radius obtained by setting @xmath47 .",
    "lightcurve inversion means inferring @xmath48 from @xmath49 .",
    "if observations only span a single rotation , or if a planet has zero obliquity , one can only constrain the longitudinal variations in albedo .    the visibility , @xmath50 , and illumination , @xmath51 , can be expressed compactly in terms of the locations of the sub - observer and sub - stellar points : @xmath52\\\\ i(\\theta,\\phi , t ) = & \\max[\\sin\\theta \\sin\\theta_{\\rm star } \\cos(\\phi-\\phi_{\\rm star } ) \\\\ & + \\cos\\theta \\cos\\theta_{\\rm star } , 0 ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the sub - observer longitude , @xmath54 is the constant sub - observer latitude , @xmath55 and @xmath56 $ ] are the sub - stellar longitude and latitude ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the rotational and orbital angular velocities of the planet , @xmath59 is the initial orbital position of the planet , @xmath60 is the orbital location of northern summer solstice , and @xmath61 is the planet s obliquity .",
    "it is non - trivial to compute @xmath55 over a sizable fraction of an orbit , requiring a numerical integration or use of the equation of time .",
    "for the current application , however , the planet s rotation period is much shorter than its orbital period , so it is sufficient to assume that @xmath62 is constant and @xmath55 advances linearly at one revolution per solar day ( as opposed to the sidereal day used in computing @xmath63 ) .",
    "we use horizons to compute the relative positions of the deep impact spacecraft , earth and the sun at the start of the various epoxi campaigns .",
    "both of the epoxi polar observations were obtained with a viewing geometry very close to quadrature .",
    "the weight function therefore has a width of 90@xmath40 in longitude , indicating that we would need a model with 8 longitudinal slices of uniform albedo to achieve nyquist sampling of the rotational lightcurve , in the absence of specular reflection ( for more discussion on slice vs sinusoidal longitudinal profiles see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an 8-slice model with variable phase offset ( prime meridian ) would have 9 model parameters ; we instead use sinusoidal maps with terms up to fourth order , which also have 9 model parameters but which converge better @xcite . the best - fit reduced @xmath64 of these models are somewhat lower than unity because the @xmath25 `` error bars '' that we use are much larger than the point - to - point scatter in the lightcurves .",
    "we estimate uncertainties in our longitudinal eigencolor maps with a monte carlo test . using our adopted photometric error of @xmath25",
    ", we generate 10,000 statistically equivalent instances of the observed lightcurves assuming gaussian , uncorrelated errors .",
    "we run the same pca and lightcurve inversion on each of these mock data sets and take the standard deviation in the resulting maps to be the uncertainty in our fiducial maps .",
    "note that the rotational inversion may be performed directly on the lightcurves shown in figures 1 & 2 , and independently of the pca described in   3 , yielding albedo maps of earth in various wavebands .",
    "instead , we combine pca and lightcurve inversion as we did in @xcite and produce longitudinal maps of the dominant eigencolors , shown in figures  [ polar1_eigen_maps ] & [ polar2_eigen_maps ] . based on the numerical experiments of   3.1 , we expect both dominant eigencolors in figure  [ polar1_eigen_maps ] to be tracking clouds and snow - covered land , while the red eigencolor is also sensitive to cloud - free land .",
    "since clouds are more prevalent at these latitudes , the red eigencolor does not faithfully locate the major landforms , as it did in @xcite . the southern polar observation ( figure  [ polar2_eigen_maps ] ) shows a broad maximum in the gray eigencolor at a longitude of 90@xmath40  w , roughly corresponding to the location of patagonia and the antarctic peninsula .",
    "since snow - covered land is essentially indistinguishable from clouds at these poor spectral resolutions , we must remain agnostic about the source of this variability .",

    "since the polar regions of earth are largely covered in snow and ice , it is worth asking if one might confuse a habitable planet like earth with a snowball planet ( ie : one caught in the cold branch of a snow - albedo positive feedback loop .",
    "see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this section",
    "we describe a toy model for the reflectance of such a snowball planet , and compare the resulting photometry to the epoxi polar observations .",

    "the geography of our snowball earth model is shown in figure  [ continents_map ] .",
    "we use the same idealized paleogeography for the sturtian glaciation ( @xmath65750  mya ) as @xcite .",
    "paleomagnetism only constrains the magnetic _ latitude _ of continents , however , and we are at liberty to choose any longitudinal distribution .",
    "the diurnal variability of the planet is determined solely by its longitudinal geography , however .",
    "if the continents are spread out uniformly in longitude , for example , the planet would not exhibit any rotational variability in the absence of heterogeneous cloud cover .",
    "we instead adopt the opposite limit of a single mega - continent . this will tend to exaggerate the amplitude of the diurnal variations in apparent albedo , but the changes in color should be robust .    assuming that sea - level was not grossly different from today , and that only trace amounts of continent - formation has occurred in the intervening 750 myrs , continents should cover @xmath66% of the planet , as today . at first sight , assuming constant water levels during a global glaciation seems inconsistent .",
    "however , it is only icecaps ( ice on land ) that significantly change water levels , while the geological evidence for snowball earth episodes instead require that the _ oceans _ be frozen at the equator .",
    "in fact , this criterion effectively shuts down the planet s hydrological cycle , so the polar ice caps are not very different from the present day . in any case , the high latitudes of a snowball earth should be covered in snow , regardless of whether the underlying regions are continent or ocean .",
    "therefore , the precise fraction of land vs ocean does not directly impact the observed diurnal variability .    for a snowball planet",
    ", we assume that both oceans and continents are covered in snow at latitudes greater than 30@xmath40 .",
    "closer to the equator , we assume that continents are bare , dry land due to the very low precipitation ; while oceans are covered in blue glacier ice that flows towards the equator @xcite .     of the poles",
    "both continents and oceans are covered in snow .",
    "the tropics are dry ( bare land or glacier ice ) due to negative net precipitation.,width=317 ]      climate models of snowball earth are concerned with albedo only insofar as it modulates the energy budget of the planet .",
    "that is to say , they care about the bond albedo , @xmath67 , the fraction of incident energy that is reflected back into space .",
    "we , on the other hand , are concerned with the appearance of the planet as seen from the outside , @xmath68 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to make a detailed snowball earth spectral model .",
    "we therefore assume diffuse ( a.k.a .",
    "lambert ) reflection and use a wavelength - dependent albedo , @xmath69 , that is simply a function of location rather than a bidirectional reflectance distribution function .",
    "a hard snowball earth will not have appreciable expanses of liquid water to contribute to glint .",
    "that being said , other elements , notably clouds , are not strictly lambertian ( eg , * ? ? ? * ) .    for a cloud - free and airless model planet , the albedo spectrum at each point on the planet",
    "is simply determined by the albedo spectrum of the surface type at that location .",
    "reflection from clouds and rayleigh scattering from air molecules complicates this picture , however .",
    "we treat the albedo from these semi - transparent media as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the effective albedo due to rayleigh scattering , @xmath72 is the albedo due to clouds , and @xmath73 is the albedo of the surface type at that point on the planet .",
    "this simple expression captures the essential behavior of clouds and rayleigh scattering : they always increase the effective albedo of a region , but the effect is most pronounced for a dark underlying surface .",
    "( snow : 0.8 ; glacier ice : 0.6 ; thin cloud : 0.3 , dry land : 0.3 , rayleigh scattering : @xmath74).,width=317 ]    our model has 5 elements , each with a distinctive albedo spectrum , shown in figure  [ surface_albedo_spectra ] .",
    "we use spectra for dry land and snow from robinson et al .",
    "the snow albedo spectrum we use is for medium grained snow , while the cold , dry climate of a snowball earth would create small - grained snow , as seen in antarctica @xcite .",
    "there is no perceptible difference in the broadband albedo spectra of these two kinds of snow at optical wavelengths , however .",
    "we use the empirical albedo spectrum for blue glacier ice from @xcite . to mimic the thin clouds expected on a frozen planet with reduced hydrological activity",
    ", we take a generic cloud spectrum ( robinson 2009 , priv .",
    "comm . ) and divide the albedo by 2 .",
    "( using thicker clouds increases the bond albedo of our model planet but does not significantly change the color variability . )",
    "we distribute the clouds on the planet using a snapshot of cloud maps from a snowball earth general circulation model @xcite .",
    "note that this model was run using the same idealized geography shown in figure  12 and thus offers a good estimate of the spatial and in particular longitudinal variations in cloud cover .",
    "we estimate the disc - integrated effect of rayleigh scattering by comparing the standard and rayleigh - scattering - free vpl models ( described in appendix  i ) and using equation  [ combine_albedo ] .",
    "our snowball earth model has a time - averaged bond albedo of 70% , which is self - consistent with the snow - albedo feedback ) and exposes glacier ice ( @xmath75 ) near the equator . ] : @xcite used a 70% albedo to induce their `` white earth '' solution in a 2-d model .",
    "@xcite ran gcms of a hard snowball earth and maintained the snowball state with albedos of 6067% .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , ran snowball earth global climate models ( gcms ) with bolometric albedos of 2040% ; @xcite have an average bond albedo of approximately 50% for the frozen earth .      for directly - imaged exoplanets",
    ", the albedo can not be determined independently of the planet s radius : photometry of reflected light will constrain the quantity @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , while the general agreement in @xmath77 between our toy model and self - consistent simulations is encouraging , one can not in general use the absolute albedo of an exoplanet as a diagnostic .",
    "multiband observations will tell us about the colors of the planet , however , and with sufficiently high cadence observations it will be possible to measure the variations in apparent albedo due to the planet s rotation .",
    "we compute the variations in apparent albedo for an equatorial observer and a planet at quadrature .",
    "the time - averaged spectrum of our snowball earth model ( figure  [ time_averaged_spectrum ] ) is completely different from that of the modern earth , regardless of viewing geometry ( figure  [ average_albedo_spectrum ] ) .",
    "the flat spectrum shortward of 650  nm is due to snow and glacier ice , which are so reflective at these wavelengths as to make rayleigh scattering imperceptible .",
    "the drop in albedo at longer wavelengths is also driven by snow and glacier ice .    for our snowball model , the shortest wavelengths exhibit the most variability , as shown by the vertical bars in figure  [ time_averaged_spectrum ] .",
    "this is because bare land and glacier ice exhibit the largest contrast at short wavelengths , while at longer wavelengths they both have near - ir albedos of @xmath6540% .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the case for the modern earth , which exhibits variability at all wavebands .",
    "we conclude that given high - quality photometry the modern - day earth could not be mistaken for a snowball planet , regardless of the viewing geometry .",
    "we presented time - resolved , disc - integrated observations of earth s polar regions from the deep impact spacecraft as part of the epoxi mission of opportunity .",
    "these complement the equatorial views presented in @xcite .",
    "we found that both of the polar observations have broadband colors similar to the equatorial earth , but with uniformly higher albedos .",
    "we explained this in terms of the 2-d weight function for disc - integrated observations of earth , which was most sensitive to the tropics for the equatorial observations , and most sensitive to mid - latitudes for the polar observations .",
    "we performed pca on a suite of simulated rotational multi - band lightcurves from nasa s virtual planetary laboratory 3d earth model .",
    "we found that pca correctly indicates the number of different surfaces rotating in and out of view .",
    "we found that while the red eigencolor consistently tracks cloud - free land , a blue eigencolor only tracks oceans when clouds are entirely absent from the simulation . in",
    "the general ( cloudy ) case , a blue eigencolor is simply tracking cloud inhomogeneities .",
    "gray eigencolors , when they are present , track large cloud patterns and/or snow - covered land .",
    "we also performed pca on the epoxi polar observations . comparing these eigencolors to known surface types on earth",
    ", we establish that the variability seen in the north epoxi polar observation is due to clouds , continents and oceans rotating in and out of view ; the lack of large cloud - free land ( ie : deserts ) at the latitudes probed by these observations keep us from being able to faithfully extract the positions of major northern landforms .",
    "the south polar observation , on the other hand , was characterized by gray variability due to a large cloud pattern in the south oceans .",
    "lastly , we constructed a simple reflectance model for a snowball earth , and found that both the time - averaged broadband colors and diurnal color variations of a snowball earth ( gray snow @xmath78 near - ir roll - off ; variability at blue wavelengths ) would be distinguishable from the modern - day earth ( near - uv rayleigh ramp @xmath78 gray clouds ; variability at all wavelengths ) , regardless of viewing angle .",
    "we listed the possible constraints one could get from time - resolved photometry in section  1 , here we briefly review the three forms of photometric characterization used in this paper in the context of measurements from planned space telescopes .",
    "we have considered time - resolved , multi - band optical photometry , which could be obtained with a space - based high - contrast imaging mission . on its own , such a telescope could discover nearby exoplanets , determine their approximate orbits , and characterize their time - averaged colors and time - variability of colors .",
    "the _ time - averaged colors _ of a planet will be the most accessible observable .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the broadband colors would be sufficient to distinguish between the modern day earth and a snowball earth . on modern - day earth ,",
    "polar ice and snow do nt contribute significantly to the time - averaged albedo of earth even with polar viewing geometries because of the glancing angle of sunlight at those latitudes .",
    "the coldest regions of a planet receive the least sunlight , and therefore contribute correspondingly little to the disk - integrated properties of the planet .",
    "the _ time - variability of the colors _ are harder to obtain , requiring shorter integration times and therefore a larger telescope , all other things being equal . on the other hand ,",
    "variability measurements are more robust to contamination from exo - zodiacal light .",
    "we have shown that modern earth regardless of viewing angle exhibits photometric variability at all wavelengths ( rms variability within a factor of 2 for all wavebands ) , while snowball earth varies 7 times more at short wavelengths than at long wavelengths .",
    "a more subtle analysis of the time variability may even allow us to distinguish between the equatorial and polar viewing geometries of earth , because clouds play a larger role at mid - latitudes .",
    "from an equatorial vantage point , the dominant eigencolor is red , followed by blue ; for the polar geometries , the ordering of the red and blue eigencolors is flipped , or there is a single dominant grey eigencolor .",
    "if the planet s radius can be estimated , then its albedo can be put on an absolute scale and one can estimate its bond albedo .",
    "transiting planets have very well characterized radii , but nearby earth analogs will almost certainly _ not _ be transiting .",
    "instead , a radius estimate will require an additional large space mission : either an infrared high - contrast imaging telescope , or a space based astrometry mission .",
    "in the first case , thermal and reflected photometry can be combined to estimate the planet s radius .",
    "if thermal photometry is obtained at a variety of phases , then the efficiency of heat transport to the planet s night - side may be estimated @xcite , and the systematic uncertainty will be @xmath79% due to the unkown efficiency of latitudinal heat transport @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the radius will therefore likely be dominated by the known uncertainties in thermal and reflected photometry .    in the second case",
    ", the star s astrometric wobble provides a mass measurement for the planet ; by assuming a planetary density , one can estimate the planet s radius .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty here is the planet s composition : given a mass , a planet s radius may vary by 50% ( eg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to absolute albedo estimates only valid to within a factor of 2 . transiting planet surveys will likely reduce these systematic uncertainties by providing an empirical mass - radius relation for planets across a wide range of masses .",
    "it is not clear to what extent the _ kepler _ mission ( eg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will help define the mass - radius relation : although the vast majority of _ kepler _ candidates are likely to be _ bona fide _ planets @xcite , most will not have mass estimates .",
    "the smaller , and better characterized , radius uncertainty would therefore most likely come from combining optical and infrared photometry , rather than from a mass measurement .",
    "the _ bond albedo _ would allow us to better distinguish between the equatorial ( @xmath80 ) and polar ( @xmath81 ) epoxi observations , or between a snowball planet ( @xmath82 ) and a temperate one .",
    "in general , this quantity would be very useful in determining a planet s energy budget and would go a long way towards constraining its habitability .",

    "for completeness , we begin by re - running the pca on the actual earth1 data obtained by the deep impact spacecraft .",
    "this endeavor is not redundant , since there are many differences between our current analysis and that of @xcite : 1 ) here we use a different solar spectrum in computing reflectance ( the change is most noticeable in the 950  nm waveband ) ; 2 ) we are now using rigorously - defined apparent albedo ; 3 ) we run the analysis individually on the earth1 , rather than on both equatorial observations simultaneously ; and 4 ) we do not apply the cloud - variability uncertainties when running the pca .    in figure  [ earth1_all ]",
    "we summarize the results of the pca performed on the 2008 epoxi equinox data .",
