    "the primary goal of this paper is to provide a convenient way of visualising the root systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "there are two important relations on a root system that one might wish to have a good understanding of : the poset structure , in which @xmath2 if @xmath3 is a positive root , and the orthogonality structure , in which @xmath4 if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are orthogonal roots .    in our paper on cominuscule schubert calculus , with frank sottile @xcite",
    ", we found that our examples required a good simultaneous understanding both these structures .",
    "this is easy enough to acquire for the root systems corresponding to the classical lie groups . in @xmath7 , for example , one can visualise the positive roots as the entries of an strictly upper triangular @xmath8 matrix , where the @xmath9 position represents the root @xmath10",
    ". then @xmath11 , if and only if @xmath5 is weakly right and weakly above @xmath6 .",
    "orthogononality is also straightforward in this picture : @xmath5 and @xmath6 are non - orthogonal if there is some @xmath12 such that crossing out the @xmath13 row and the @xmath13 column succeeds in crossing out both @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "see figure [ fig : staircase ] .    in type @xmath14 , it is less obvious how to draw such a concrete picture",
    ". separately the two structures have been well studied in the contexts of minuscule posets @xcite , and strongly regular graphs ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , once one draws the hasse diagram of the posets , the orthogonality structure suddenly becomes mysterious .",
    "of course , one can always calculate which pairs of roots are orthogonal , but we would prefer a picture which allows us to do it instantly .",
    "thus the main thrust of this paper is to get to figures  [ fig : cubecorner ] and  [ fig : square ] , which illustrate how one can simultaneously visualise @xmath1 and @xmath0 posets and orthogonality structures , at least restricted to certain strata of the root system .",
    "the restriction of these structures to the strata is exactly what is needed for the type @xmath14 examples in @xcite . with a little more work",
    ", one can use these figures to recover the partial order and orthogonality structures for the complete root system .    to reach these diagrams ,",
    "we begin by considering certain maps from a root system to @xmath15 , which are injective ( or 2:1 if @xmath16 ) . once we have some general observations about these maps , we give examples for @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are particularly nice . in these cases , we show that properties of the underlying root system are reflected in simple combinatorial structures on the target space , which is what allows us to produce diagrams in question .",
    "as the @xmath1 example is richer , we will discuss it before the @xmath0 example .",
    "the idea of relating the @xmath0 and @xmath1 root systems to @xmath15 has appeared elsewhere .",
    "for example , harris @xcite uses such an identification to describe the galois group of the 27 lines on the cubic surface ",
    "one of the del pezzo surfaces .",
    "the connection between del pezzo surfaces and the exceptional lie groups has been well established ; we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "one can also see such a relationship reflected in the well known identification of weyl groups ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath17 these facts follow from the identifications outlined in this paper , and presumably have been proved in similar ways before .",
    "let @xmath18 be a simply laced root system , so that with respect to the inner product @xmath19 on @xmath20 we have @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 has full rank in @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the lattice in @xmath20 generated by @xmath23 .    choose a basis of simple roots @xmath25 , for @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the positive roots with respect to this basis , and @xmath28 denote the negative roots . recall that @xmath27 is a partially ordered set , with @xmath29 iff @xmath30 .",
    "roots @xmath6 and @xmath31 are comparable in the partial ordering iff @xmath32    for each @xmath33 , we define @xmath34 to be the coefficient of @xmath35 , when @xmath6 is expressed in the basis of the simple roots : @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the dynkin diagram dynkin diagram of @xmath23 .",
    "as @xmath23 is simply laced , each component of @xmath37 has type ade .",
    "the vertices of @xmath37 are denoted @xmath38 , and correspond ( respectively ) to the simple roots @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath23 is a simple root system ( i.e @xmath37 has just one component ) , the affine dynkin diagram @xmath40 is obtained by adding a vertex @xmath41 to @xmath37 , corresponding to the lowest root @xmath42 of @xmath23 .",
