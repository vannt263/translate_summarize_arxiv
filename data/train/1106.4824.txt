    "protoplanetary disks with inner clearings  because such clearings occur as the result of tidal interactions between disks and planets ( e.g.  lin & papaloizou 1993 ) .",
    "to date , over 30 transitional disks have been discovered with the irs instrument aboard the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2010 ) . if theorists were to demonstrate a planetary origin for any inner hole in a transitional disk , that disk would harbor extraordinary discovery potential for young , still - forming planets",
    "indeed , gaps in debris disks surrounding main - sequence stars harbor the giant planets fomalhaut  b @xcite , @xmath0  eridani  b @xcite , the hr  8799 system @xcite and @xmath1  pictoris  b @xcite .",
    "inner holes in gaseous protoplanetary disks with ages @xmath2  myr are initially identified by the flux deficits they leave in the near - ir and/or mid - ir part of the disk s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the observed flux deficits correspond to `` missing '' dust with characteristic temperatures of @xmath3  k ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "model seds of the first transitional disks to be discovered , gm  aur @xcite and  tw hya @xcite , were based on disks with small inner holes only 3 - 4  au wide .",
    "soon after , investigations of planet - disk interactions demonstrated that such clearings could naturally be produced by a single jupiter - mass planet @xcite .",
    "although the planet opened only a narrow gap , not a hole extending all the way to the central star , the dynamical studies showed that the residual gas and dust inside the gap would accrete onto the central star on the viscous timescale , widening the initial gap into a small , optically thin hole .",
    "the first hole - size measurements performed with millimeter interferometers showed remarkable consistency with sed - based models @xcite .",
    "however , further spatially resolved imaging of transitional disks brought a surprise .",
    "some disks for which small , 3 - 4  au inner holes were inferred based on sed modeling  including the canonical transitional disk , gm  aur  were shown to have large inner clearings of 15  au or more once imaged at high angular resolution @xcite . yet , as the models of @xcite and @xcite hinted , each single planet can open only a narrow gap , which must then widen into a hole by viscous clearing of the material inside the gap .",
    "the extraordinarily long viscous timescales at distances of 15  au or more meant the simple theory that each transitional disk hole contained a single giant planet was no longer satisfactory .    the prosaic explanation for wide holes in transitional disks  tidal truncation of the disk by a stellar companion , as observed in coku tau/4 @xcite  is also not likely responsible for the unusual and complex disks that concern us in this article . based on observations with the keck interferometer , @xcite rule out stellar companions in 0.35 - 4 au orbits at the 99.7% confidence level in the holes of dm  tau , gm  aur , lkca  15 , ux  tau  a and ry  tau  at least three of which are examples of transitional disks with wide holes @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found no stellar companions in the inner holes of dm  tau , gm  aur , lkca  15 and ux  tau  a in their non - redundant aperture masking survey of the taurus star - forming region .",
    "the high accretion rates in these sources ( see table [ table : stats ] and references therein ) , as well as the presence of inner disk dust and gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are also consistent with sub - stellar rather than stellar companions , as they indicate that disk truncation is incomplete .",
    "the set of transitional disks with large inner holes , up to 75  au , and significant accretion represents a significant subset of transitional disks , and a subset that continues to increase in number @xcite . in table",
    "[ table : stats ] , we list a sample of eight rapidly accreting transitional disks that have holes between 15 au and @xmath4  au wide .",
    "in general , transitional disks have a variety of observational characteristics and may not represent a single physical phenomenon .",
    "for example , clearing driven by the magnetorotational instability @xcite can widen dynamically cleared holes once such holes extend all the way to the dust - sublimation radius . in  [ otherclearing ] we explain in detail why magnetorotational clearing can not be responsible for the particular set of transitional disks listed in table [ table : stats ] .",
    "photoevaporation can also produce disks with inner cleared regions .",
    "prior work on uv photoevaporation showed that evaporation - induced inner holes were inconsistent with accretion rates higher than @xmath5  yr  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in essence , hole formation can only occur once evaporation rates exceed accretion rates , as otherwise the hole will be replenished by accretion .",
    "more recently , however , it has been argued that x - ray photoevaporation should be the dominant disk - clearing process and produce much higher mass - loss rates than uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the set of parameter space consistent with photoevaporation has grown to include somewhat higher accretion rates .",
    "it is entirely possible that photoevaporation produces some transitional disks , while dynamical clearing by planets produces others .",
    "however , even x - ray photoevaporation models do not appear to be able to explain the existence of disks with _ both _ large holes @xmath7 1520 au _ and _ significant accretion rates @xmath8 yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "there is yet one more possible explanation for accreting transitional disks with wide holes ",
    "clearing by multiple planets , whose individual gaps could overlap to form a wide hole . since planets have gap - crossing tidal tails and do nt completely truncate the disk , a multiplanet system would allow gas and dust to accrete through the gap . in this work , we demonstrate that the particular set of transitional disks with wide holes and high accretion rates listed in table [ table : stats ] presents unambiguous evidence for tidal clearing by _ multiple _ planets .",
    "while @xcite found that wide , optically thin gaps in accreting disks could not be produced by planets alone , their conclusions were based on the assumption of axisymmetric gas and dust in the hole . instead , by taking into account the non - axisymmetric flow patterns produced by planets , we argue not only that multiple planets are consistent with high accretion rates and reduced infrared fluxes , but that they represent the only possible explanation for our sample of transitional disks .",
    "we begin our argument for planetary influence on transitional disks in  [ diskproperties ] , where we demonstrate that planetary systems provide a viable explanation for the gas confinement , non - axisymmetry and mid - ir flux deficits observed in transitional disks with large holes . in ",
    "[ oneplanet ] , we show that the simplest planetary configuration  a single gas giant inside the hole  cannot explain the transitional disks with wide holes .",
    "we present dynamical models of multiple planets opening overlapping gaps in  [ multiplanets ] . in  [ modelseds ]",
    "we use the density distributions predicted by the dynamical model in  [ multiplanets ] to produce seds , and discuss compatibility with observed photometry . in  [ photoevaporation ]",
    "we delve into the photoevaporation mechanism in more detail , demonstrating conclusively that it is not a viable originator of our sample of transitional disks",
    ". finally , we present conclusions and testable predictions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the primary observational characteristic that defines all transitional disks is that the near- and/or mid - ir fluxes are lower than those observed from ` typical ' protoplanetary disks .",
    "since the total flux emitted from an optically thick disk is not affected by small changes in the disk surface density , the deficit of flux in transitional disks is generally interpreted as requiring depletion sufficient to make the disk vertically optically thin at the flux - deficient wavelengths .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that the actual observable is the emitted _ flux _ , not the optical depth , @xmath9 .",
    "knowledge of optical depth is required to convert observed fluxes into disk surface densities , but the assumption that @xmath9 is uniform throughout the hole , or even constant within a given annulus , can lead to serious errors in estimating the mass distribution in the inner disk . in particular , confined , optically thick ` streamers ' within a hole can produce the same emergent flux as azimuthally symmetric , optically thin dust , while hiding a significant amount of the dust and gas that must move through the hole to match observed accretion rates . if the grains in a narrow tidal tail cover more surface area than the tidal tail itself , so that the tail is locally optically thick , some of the grain mass is effectively hidden .",
    "clumping in saturn s rings produces exactly this type of plateau in apparent optical depth as a function of particle surface density ( robbins et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in the case of optically thick tidal tails surrounded by empty space , one can simply replace @xmath9 with a geometrical `` filling factor '' , @xmath10  the fraction of an annulus s area covered by tidal tails  in the standard equation for disk flux : @xmath11 f(r)/d^2 , \\label{diskflux}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the flux at a given frequency , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the disk inner and outer radii , respectively , @xmath15 is the planck function in frequency space , @xmath16 is the distance to the system , and @xmath17 is the dust temperature at a given radius .",
    "an important difference between @xmath18 and optical depth @xmath9 , however , is that @xmath18 is purely geometric , and so independent of @xmath19 , while @xmath9 depends on the opacity @xmath20 , which is a function of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the mass distribution and/or temperature structure must be different in the two cases in order to produce the same spectrum .",
    "in addition , in a realistic disk , one must account for the optically thin disk atmosphere , which produces silicate emission features dependent on @xmath20 .",
    "as an example of the ambiguities inherent in modeling transitional disk seds , in figure 1 , we show two alternative inner disk dust distributions that produce similar near - ir spectra . to model the resultant flux of the models , we used the radiative transfer code radmc ( similar to * ? ? ?",
    "* but without vertical structure integration ) but optically thin components were also benchmarked with an analytical model .",
    "the first model consists of an optically thin region from @xmath21{the measured inner radius of gm~aur 's disk from near - ir interferometric measurements \\citep{akeson05}.}-1 $ ] au ( with @xmath22 used for this and all other models  and @xmath23 g  @xmath24 ) and a second optically thin region from 1620 au ( with @xmath25 g  @xmath24 ) .",
    "the second model consists of an optically thin region from @xmath26 au ( with @xmath27 g  @xmath24 ) and an optically thick streamer from @xmath28 au ( with @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "both models use the same standard milky way dust composition of 80% small circumstellar silicates and 20% small carbon grains @xcite , with opacities from @xcite and @xcite ( `` acar '' ) .",
    "the carbon grains , being featureless , only act to reduce the line / continuum contrast , and so their quantity is degenerate with other parameters , such as the inner disk small dust grain mass .",
    "optically thin surface densities were chosen to roughly match gm  aur photometric data ( although an exhaustive analysis of parameter space was not performed , and clearly these models have some trouble accurately fitting the observed silicate feature ) .",
    "the two models produce nearly identical emergent spectra .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates that significant radial mass transfer can occur through transitional disk holes and still match photometric data , provided the mass is channeled into narrow streams such as planetary tidal tails .    besides extremely wide inner holes and high accretion rates ,",
    "many transitional disks contain additional signatures of dynamical perturbation by planetary systems .",
    "@xcite noted significant azimuthal asymmetries in the outer disk dust distribution for lkh@xmath31 330 and hd 135344 b , while @xcite noted asymmetries in the disks of hd 135344 b and sr 21 on the scale of a few au or less .",
    "near - ir spectra were suggestive of radial dust asymmetries such as eccentric inner holes in even early modeling studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and recent studies show that both pre - transitional and transitional disks require multiple inner disk components , including nearly evacuated regions , in order to match observed fluxes and interferometric visibilities @xcite .",
    "similarly , sr 21 has a gas disk truncated at @xmath327 au @xcite , while the dust disk is truncated at @xmath33 au @xcite .",
    "finally , co rovibrational lineshapes suggest that hot co gas in transitional disks may be dynamically confined to smaller regions than in disks without inner holes ( salyk et al .  2011 ) .",
    "the tidal barriers of massive planets would provide an extremely effective way to limit the radial distribution of hot gas in transitional disk holes .",
    "a final , unusual characteristic of transitional disks is that they do not seem to arise at any particular star age .",
    "rather , @xcite show that the transitional disk fraction is 3 - 4% in the taurus , chamaeleon and ophiuchus star - forming regions , despite an age spread of 1.5  myr betweeen the clusters .",
    "the transitional disk fractions reported by currie & sicilia - aguilar ( 2011 ) also indicate that disks with inner holes ( as opposed to homologously depleted disks ) are not preferentially found in clusters of a particular age . the inner - hole configuration ,",
    "then , does not appear to represent an evolutionary stage all disks must go through  in which case there would be a peak in the transitional disk fraction for a given cluster age .",
    "@xcite use their observed transitional disk fractions to argue that the optically thin inner - hole configuration lasts about 100,000 years , which is similar to type ii planet migration timescales from the 10 - 15  au region @xcite .",
    "note , however , the warning by currie & sicilia - aguilar ( 2011 ) that there is a degeneracy between the time it takes a process to operate , and the frequency with which it operates .",
    "it is possible that @xmath34  years is the hole clearing timescale rather than the lifetime of the inner hole .",
    "planets , therefore , have the potential to provide all the unusual characteristics we observe in the subset of transitional disks under investigation here ( table [ table : stats ] ) :    * wide , apparently optically thin inner holes with @xmath35  au , * near and mid - ir flux decrements as compared to classical protoplanetary disks , * high accretion rates of at least @xmath36 , * confined , non - axisymmetrically distributed gas and dust .    in the next section ,",
    "we begin by examining the suitability of the simplest planetary configuration , a single gas giant , for opening the wide holes observed in our sample of transitional disks .",
    "clearing by a single giant planet is a commonly invoked explanation for the gaps in transitional disks ( e.g. rice et al .  2003 ,",
    "espaillat et al .",
    "2008 , furlan et al .",
    "2009 ) . in  [ gapwidth ]",
    "we quantify the maximum gap width a planet can open , showing that it is not enough to explain our sample of accreting transitional disks with wide holes . in ",
    "[ accretion ] and [ otherclearing ] we show that even when one considers the combined effects of a gap - opening planet and accretion or spiral wake - driven clearing of material inside the gap , the timescale for opening a wide hole is outside the inferred @xmath34-year transitional disk lifetime / clearing time .      to build a simple analytical framework for understanding the scope of planetary influence on disks , we begin by imagining the disk as a swarm of massless test particles . treating the disk as if it were composed of test particles on ballistic trajectories gives the maximum possible gap width a planet can open because gas pressure and viscosity act to fill in the dynamically cleared gap .",
    "we estimate the maximum gap width by examining the time it takes for the planet to substantially alter the angular momentum of close - passing particles .",
    "the planet opens a gap when repeated encounters cause the particles at a given location to be strongly scattered within the age of the star / disk system .",
    "we define strong scattering as a change in the test particle s specific angular momentum of a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "the analytical framework used here applies to non - resonant particle orbits .",
    "we consider a test particle with keplerian frequency @xmath37 and unperturbed orbital radius @xmath38 during a close encounter with the planet , which has keplerian frequency @xmath39 and orbital radius @xmath40 .",
    "both the planet and the test particle are initially on circular orbits . in a single encounter",

    "the rate of change in the particle s specific angular momentum due to repeated encounters with the planet is therefore @xmath46 where the time between encounters is @xmath47 the timescale over which the particle s specific angular momentum changes by of order unity is simply @xmath48    figure [ timescale ] shows the scattering timescale of disk particles orbiting near two hypothetical planets , one with jupiter s mass and the other with saturn s mass .",
    "both planets are placed 10  au from a sun - like star .",
    "each planet s tidal radius , or hill radius , is defined by @xmath49 given a stellar mass of @xmath50 .",
    "for test particles within three hill radii of the planet s orbit , the scattering timescale is @xmath51 years or less .",
    "tidal interactions with planets are therefore extremely efficient at opening gaps in protoplanetary disks .",
    "notably , crida et al .  ( 2006 ) found that even in strongly accreting disks with kinematic viscosity of order @xmath52 at 1  au , corresponding to an accretion rate of @xmath53 ( dodson - robinson et al .",
    "2009a ) , a jupiter - mass planet ( @xmath54 ) can open a gap in only 1000 orbits .",
    "encouragingly , planets can open gaps even in disks where strong accretion would readily fill in gaps created by photoevaporative winds",
    ".    there is , however , a limited scope to the tidal influence of the planet .",
    "as we see from figure [ timescale ] , the scattering timescale for particles located four hill radii or more from the planet approaches the ages of transitional disk host stars . setting a high scattering timescale limit of @xmath55  years , which is one - half to one - quarter",
    "the estimated stellar age in the taurus - auriga association @xcite and five times higher than the inferred transitional disk lifetime / clearing time @xcite , we find that the gap opened by a planet may not exceed @xmath56  hill radii . and , since the hill radius scales as @xmath57 , simply increasing the planet mass does not provide a commensurate widening of the gap . even for a @xmath58 planet at 10  au ,",
    "the hill radius is only 1.2  au , which allows a gap to open from 4  au16  au .",
    "this gap is simply not wide enough to account for the observed hole sizes of any of the transitional disks listed in table [ table : stats ] .    given the sharp increase in scattering timescale as a function of distance from the planet ( figure [ timescale ] ) , our maximum gap width is not highly sensitive to our assumed gap - opening timescale .",
    "our order - of - magnitude estimate of maximum gap width agrees with the numerical work of crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . using analytical and numerical calculations of the balance between torques from the planet and viscous stresses",
    ", they found that a jupiter - mass planet in a disk with aspect ratio @xmath59 opened a gap with a _ full _ radius of @xmath60 between the planet orbit and the primordial , unperturbed disk .",
    "the width of the optically thin gap is , of course , much smaller than the full center - to - wall width .",
    "our calculation of @xmath61 as the maximum gap size is actually rather generous .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that a single planet can not clear a gap wider than @xmath56 tidal radii over typical t - tauri star ages .",
    "a jupiter - mass planet at 10  au could therefore open a gap extending from 6.513.5  au .",
    "however , the star is accreting : could the accretion flow drain the disk interior to the planet s orbit ( which we hereby label the `` interior disk '' ) within the transitional disk lifetime and/or clearing time ? for a disk with steady - state mass transfer , the diffusion timescale is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the star accretion rate and @xmath64 is the interior disk mass .",
    "a derivation of equation [ difftime ] is in appendix [ appendix1 ] . for narrow annuli of material located near the star ,",
    "so that @xmath65  au , clearing of the interior disk by viscous accretion seems possible . consider a disk with a surface density profile of @xmath66 and an inner edge due to magnetospheric truncation at 0.1  au .",
    "this is the pre - clearing density profile of the gm  aur disk constructed by hughes et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who inferred a total disk mass of @xmath67 and an outer radius of 300  au from millimeter imaging .",
    "if the star accretes at a rate of @xmath68 , the diffusion timescale for material in the inner 2  au is @xmath34  years , similar to transitional disk lifetimes / clearing times ( furlan et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "however , what about holes that are 20  au or larger ? once can place a planet at most @xmath69 from the desired edge of the hole , or at about 14  au for a @xmath70 planet orbiting a sun - like star .",
    "( since @xmath71 scales linearly with the planet s orbital radius , we open the widest gap if we place the planet as far from the star as possible . )",
    "the inside edge of the planet s gap is then at about 8  au . for the inferred gm  aur density profile ,",
    "the diffusion timescale for material at 8  au is now @xmath72  years , edging toward a significant fraction of star ages in the taurus , ophiuchus and coronet associations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the diffusion timescale is a really an e - folding time ( appendix [ appendix1 ] ) , not a time in which complete clearing of interior disk material occurs .    to check",

    "we will use the convention that @xmath74 refers to an opacity based on total mass , gas and dust together , and @xmath76 gives an opacity referenced to the mass of dust grains only .",
    "the vertical optical depth of the disk is simply @xmath77 a surface density of only 20  g  @xmath24 of gas and dust mixed with a 100:1 mass ratio is sufficient to make a disk optically thick , @xmath78 , at @xmath79  mm .",
    "diffusing the 100  g  @xmath24 initially at 8  au in our reconstructed gm  aur disk down to optically thin levels would take _ two _ e - foldings , or @xmath80  yr .",
    "even for our hypothetical gap with an inner edge at 2  au , for which the characteristic diffusion timescale is seemingly reasonable , three e - folding times are required to get to optically thin levels , or @xmath81  yr . if a planet is far enough from its host star for the outer edge of its gap to be at 15 - 20  au or more , there is a severe timescale problem with clearing its interior disk to optically thin levels by viscous accretion .",
    "as we explore in the next section , the mid - ir limits on leftover surface density from the interior disk are even stronger than the limits from millimeter observations .",
    "interior disk material could be cleared via the scenario proposed by varnire et al .",

    "single planets and their spiral wakes therefore do not clear enough material from the interior disk to explain observed transitional disk seds . however , our submicron grain opacity value is calculated assuming the grains have maximum sizes of 1  @xmath85 m or less .",
    "it is possible that the combination of a single planet , wake - driven hole clearing , and locking away 98% of the solid mass in pebbles , planetesimals and/or planet cores could be consistent with observed transitional disk fluxes .",
    "we have also considered whether photoevaporation or the magnetorotational instability ( `` mri '' , chiang & murray - clay 2007 ) could clear the interior disk material . as we discuss in detail in  [ photoevaporation ] , phoevaporative clearing is only efficient at radii @xmath86 au .",
    "in such a scenario , the interior disk still clears via viscous accretion , and is subject to the time constraints we have just discussed . the mri scenario proposed by @xcite",
    "also can not clear the interior disk material .",
    "if the inner disk is _ already _ cleared of most small dust grains , x - rays can ionize material at the edge of the hole and produce inside - out hole widening . the accretion rate",
    "is then found to scale roughly as the square of the hole size .",
    "inside - out mri clearing is therefore not effective at _ initiating _ the clearing of material from the interior disk ( ie , at small disk radii ) .",
    "transitional disks such as gm  aur and lkh@xmath31  330 , with inner hole radii of 20  au and 50  au , respectively ( hughes et al .  2009 , brown et al .",
    "2007 ) , can not be explained by a single orbiting planet .",
    "even if one takes into account accretion or spiral wave - induced clearing of the material left inside the planet s gap , the inner hole size that can be cleared by a single planet in of order @xmath34  years is limited to a few au .",

    "we use numerical simulations to demonstrate how the `` overlapping gap effect '' can explain even wide inner holes in accreting disks .",
    "our working picture of a transitional disk is an optically thick outer disk surrounding a wide inner hole that produces little near- and mid - infrared flux .",
    "the star must also be able to accrete material through the hole at a high rate , as much as @xmath87  yr@xmath6 .",
    "even though a single planet can only open a narrow gap , a system of multiple planets could produce a wide hole if the planet orbits were close enough together to create overlapping gaps . because the gm  aur system is one of the best - characterized transitional disks known",
    ", we use its overall mass , hole size and accretion rate ( table [ table : stats ] ) as guidelines for our study of multiple planets in transitional disks .",
    "we describe our hydrodynamic simulations of hole opening by interacting planets in  [ hydro ] .",
    "then , in  [ holestructure ] , we show that the non - axisymmetric flow patterns produced by planetary systems are the best possible explanation for the high accretion rates of transitional - disk host stars .",
    "our planet - disk simulations were conducted using the publicly available version of fargo , a polar , grid - based 2-d hydrodynamic code designed specifically for planet - disk interactions written by frederic masset ( masset 2000 ) .",
    "like all polar hydrodynamic codes built on the operator - splitting technique , fargo uses a sequence of three steps  source step , radial transport step , and azimuthal transport step  to evaluate the transport of any hydrodynamic quantity .",
    "the fargo transport algorithm differs from standard codes in that the azimuthal advection is carried out in a reference frame that rotates at the local keplerian speed , so that hydrodynamic quantities are advected using the residual velocity , @xmath88 , instead of the inertial azimuthal velocity .",
    "a subsequent step corrects for the azimuthal shifts in the field introduced by subtracting out the keplerian speed .",
    "the advantage of the fargo transport algorithm is that timesteps are not courant - limited by the short dynamical time at the inner disk boundary .",

    "far from being problematic sources of excess flux , these pileups and tails provide a critically important feature of our model : the ability to transport mass through an apparently optically thin hole .",
    "the apparent contradiction between optically thin holes and high stellar accretion rates comes from the assumption that gas and grains are evenly and axisymmetrically distributed within the hole ( espaillat et al .",

    "( 2011 ) found that simple emission models are consistent with systematically lower surface areas for transitional disks than for gap - free protoplanetary disks .",
    "the tidal barriers of planets in the inner holes of transitional disks would confine hot gas to tidal tails or narrow annuli between planets and therefore lead to a lower emitting area for hot gas in transitional disks .",
    "one issue highlighted by zhu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) was their difficulty keeping the planetary system stable .",
    "they found that migration drives the planets into 2:1 resonances , which leads to strong scattering .",

    "the planets in our simulations do begin to migrate after they are released , particularly the outermost planet , which moves from 14.3  au to 10  au over the first @xmath123 years of the simulation .",
    "yet our orbit integration shows that planetary system remains stable for more than @xmath34  years .",
    "although physical understanding of turbulent viscosity generation in disks is still limited , it is possible to construct a physically realistic transitional disk in which migration does not destabilize the planetary system .",
    "in this section we consider whether the multiplanet dynamical model shown in figure [ gmaurhydro ] is consistent with observed photometry of transitional disks .",
    "our goal is to discuss the degree of compatibility between our model and observed fluxes ; an exact fit of sed model to data is beyond the scope of this work , and would be hampered by significant limitations . among the limitations is the fact the dynamical model predicts only the gas distribution , while most observables are based on emission from small dust grains . because such grains would be affected by pressure gradients set up by the complex gas structure , and because the expected gas / small - dust - grain ratio is essentially unknown , the translation from gas distribution to an emission spectrum is not trivial .",
    "nevertheless , we make some simple assumptions here and produce models designed to give us a qualitative understanding of the compatibility between the multi - planet simulation and transitional disk observations . in particular , we believe that the most stringent requirement is that mid - ir fluxes be as low as observed , as most other features of the disk sed can be fit by tweaking any of the numerous ( and degenerate ) parameters that enter sophisticated disk models .",
    "we begin by comparing our model to photometric data of the gm  aur system .",
    "however , we find that our model is in some ways more naturally consistent with pre - transitional disks .",
    "we therefore also discuss the pre - transitional disk doar  44 .",
    "our simple model consists of three components : an optically thin inner disk from @xmath124 to 0.7 au , an optically thick component from 0.7 - 13 au with a constant filling factor @xmath18 meant to represent the dynamical model described in  [ multiplanets ] , and an optically thick outer disk from 13 au to @xmath125 ( see figure [ sed_plot ] ) .",

    "that is not directly irradiated by stellar flux but instead mostly shadowed by tidal streams , we took the difference between a model from @xmath124 to @xmath125 and another model from @xmath124 to 13  au  although , as is apparent in figure [ sed_plot ] , the observations do seem to require partial illumination to ` puff up ' the hole s outer edge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the flux from the outer disk is not the focus of this work , and we have made no effort to fully explore parameter space for these components .    instead , we are concerned with the near- and mid - ir flux contribution from the confined tidal streams in our dynamical model .",
    "we begin by discussing the mid - ir fluxes , which originate from the @xmath32 few au region of the disk .",
    "the left - hand side of figure [ sed_plot ] shows the azimuthally averaged dust surface density for our dynamical model after 400 orbits of the outermost planet .",
    "if one assumes the mass is spread evenly over all azimuths the surface density is almost everywhere optically thick at 13 @xmath85 m ( assuming an opacity of @xmath126  @xmath84 g@xmath6 for dust grains ) .",
    "not surprisingly , since transitional disks by definition have very low 13 @xmath85 m fluxes , an optically thick disk model with @xmath127 ( red squares ) is not consistent with observations . in reality , however , the density distribution predicted by the dynamical model is not everywhere optically thick , as the mass is shepherded due to the presence of the planets . in the language of  [ diskproperties ] , the azimuthal filling factor , @xmath10 , ( gray solid line ) , ranges from @xmath320.1 - 1 if the gas / solid mass ratio is 100 and all solids are in micron and submicron grains .",
    "extending the grain - size distribution up to millimeter radii or locking away solids in planetesimals and planets correspondingly lowers @xmath18 ( see figures [ gmaurhydro ] and [ highgassolid ] ) .",
    "full 2-d modeling of the emergent flux from the distribution predicted by our hydrodynamical simulation is beyond the scope of this analysis ; instead , we make the simple assumption that the flux scales proportionally to some characteristic average value of @xmath18 , and ask whether the resulting fluxes are consistent with photometric data .",
    "we implicitly assume that optically thin parts of the disk are completely devoid of grains , and so this can be considered a ` best - case ' scenario . in reality , the optically thin regions would need to have an average @xmath128 lower than that derived from axisymmetric models . on the other hand ,",
    "we begin with a conservative assumption about the gas / small - dust - grain ratio , and later discuss the implications of this choice .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ sed_plot ] compares model seds with photometry and irs spectroscopy of gm  aur .",
    "the blue curve ( triangles ) in figure [ sed_plot ] shows the flux produced if the inner hole has @xmath129 , a representative value for our dynamical model if the gas / dust mass ratio is 100 .",
    "although the flux is significantly reduced from the optically thick case , fluxes are still inconsistent with observations . instead , to match observations",
    ", @xmath18 must be significantly smaller , or @xmath130 ( black curve ) . for comparison , @xcite estimate @xmath131 at 10 @xmath85 m .",
    "note that we have not made an effort to fit the silicate feature exactly ; however , one can add additional contrast by adding small regions of optically thin dust in the inner disk , and/or by adjusting the grain composition ( and thus opacity ) .",
    "pre - transitional disks like doar 44 ( right hand side of figure [ sed_plot ] ) are similarly inconsistent with the completely optically thick model ( red squares ) , as well as the @xmath129 case ( blue triangles ) , using standard assumptions .",
    "however , since the mid - ir fluxes in this case are significantly higher , the required reduction in flux is more moderate  close to @xmath132 ( black curve ) .",
    "are the observations consistent with the dynamical model ? as discussed in  [ holestructure ] , @xmath18 is essentially anti - proportional to the fraction of solid mass locked in pebbles , planetesimals and planet cores , so one way to match observations of a disk like gm  aur is simply to reduce the mass fraction of small grains in the inner disk , as also suggested by @xcite . that much of the mass has been incorporated into large grains",
    "is certainly a reasonable possibility , given the fact that large planets have already formed .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that our simple sed models ignore the flux contribution from areas where @xmath133 locally , and so the reduction in flux with changes in @xmath18 due to grain growth is optimistic .",
    "nevertheless , with a power - law size distribution of silicate grains with a minimum grain size of @xmath134 m , setting @xmath135 mm reduces 13 @xmath85 m opacity by a factor of @xmath3210 relative to a distribution composed entirely of small grains . therefore",
    ", even moderate grain growth can easily make these models a reasonable possibility .    as an alternative to flux reduction by grain growth",
    ", one could geometrically constrain the small grains , reducing their filling factor relative to that derived for the gas .",
    "it is well known that orbiting dust grains subject to a gas pressure gradient can migrate towards pressure maxima @xcite , and so it is not unreasonable to expect some additional shepherding of dust grains relative to the gas .",
    "we now consider the near - ir fluxes .",
    "one notable feature of our dynamical model ( see figure [ gmaurhydro ] ) is the persistence of a small annulus of optically thick material between the innermost planet and the star .",
    "the dynamical influence of the innermost planet does not extend to these radii , or to radii smaller than 0.7 au , which is the inner boundary of the disk in our dynamical simulation .",
    "thus , the very inner disk is _ not _ dynamically cleared , and , if present , contributes significant near - ir flux . as discussed in  [ diskproperties ] , it is possible to hide some optically thick , but very geometrically thin , material in the gm aur inner disk .",
    "however , near - ir fluxes are certainly inconsistent with the large optically thick dust rim extending from 0.2 to 1.5 au that the dynamical model leaves behind .",
    "therefore , for disks like gm aur , this inner disk material must be cleared by another mechanism , such as viscous dissipation .",
    "our system of planets was specifically designed to have a viscous clearing timescale for inner disk material of @xmath136 years or less , so this possibility is within reason .    for so - called pre - transitional disks such as doar  44 ,",
    "however , near - ir fluxes actually require a significant amount of material close to the dust sublimation radius ( espaillat et al .",
    "2010 ; see also figure [ sed_plot ] ) . this interior pileup ,",
    "also found by @xcite , is a natural consequence of multi - planet systems of the type described here .",
    "in addition , although pre - transitional disks are essentially defined by the presence of this inner disk material , even `` traditional '' transitional disk sources typically have measurable excess dust emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as emission from hot co gas @xcite originating at @xmath137 au .",
    "thus , our model suggests that the range of observed near - ir fluxes represents a range of stages of dissipation of the material interior to the innermost planet .",
    "in  [ multiplanets ] we showed that systems of multiple planets provide a robust explanation for the observed characteristics of transitional disks : high @xmath138 , wide holes that appear optically thin , and confinement of hot gas to small emitting areas .",
    "however , another way of opening gaps in disks is to expose the disks to energetic radiation .",
    "here we discuss the viability of photoevaporation as a hole - opening mechanism .",
    "we show that , although photoevaporation can be responsible for transitional disk holes about 36  au wide , it can not build the extremely wide holes that concern us here .",
    "x - ray , extreme - uv and far - uv photons transfer kinetic energy to gas in the disk , either directly or through the photoelectric effect , allowing the gas to become unbound from the star .",
    "photoevaporative flows begin at the graviational radius , where the kinetic energy of the radiatively accelerated gas particle is equal to the escape speed from the star s potential : @xmath139 in equation [ gravradius ] , @xmath96 is the sound speed in the heated upper layers of the disk .",
    "the localization of the photoevaporative flow lends itself well to opening gaps in disks , which may then widen into holes as the interior disk drains on the viscous timescale . however , recall the discussion of the viscous timescale in  [ oneplanet ] : in order for accretion to drain away interior disk material within the lifetime of the disk , the gap must be located within a few au of the star . of x - ray , euv and fuv",
    "photons , only the x - rays have a gravitational radius that might meet our diffusion requirements .    in x - ray photoevaporation ,",
    "disk clearing begins at a characteristic `` clearing age '' of 2 - 4  myr ( owen et al .",
    "a gap in the disk opens at a characteristic radius of 3  au and the outer and interior disks are decoupled , so that the interior disk drains on the viscous timescale , several @xmath34  years to become optically thin for the surface density profile in equation [ gmaurdens ] .",
    "x - rays take approximately 10 - 20% of the clearing age , or @xmath140@xmath80  years , to deplete the material between 3 and 10  au .",
    "viscous accretion of material inside 3  au , to leave behind only optically thin dust , and outward expansion of the gap therefore occur on roughly the same timescale .",
    "once the interior disk has been accreted , the disk outside 10  au is eroded by the x - ray field hitting the hole s inner wall directly on a timescale of order the clearing age , a few million years .",
    "accreting transitional disks with inner holes between 3 and 10  au wide are therefore consistent with the x - ray photoevaporation model . indeed , owen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that approximately 50% of observed transition disks could be explained by x - ray photoevaporation .",
    "a closer look at the x - ray photoevaporation process , however , reveals why x - ray driven winds can not explain our test sample of transitional disks .",
    "once clearing begins to proceed from 10  au outward via the direct x - ray field , there is no longer any interior mass reservoir to provide accretion onto the star .",
    "accreting disks with large inner holes therefore can not be explained by x - ray driven winds . for a 20  au inner hole , such as in the gm  aur disk , owen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find a probability of less than @xmath141 that the star should still be accreting ( see their figure 12 ) .",
    "furthermore , according to the owen et al.models , one would have to wait at least 4  myr to get a 20  au hole2  myr at minimum for the initial gap to open and another 2  myr for it to move out to 20  au .",
    "their models predict that transitional disks with wide holes should be older than the average disk population , whereas furlan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and merin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) observe no correlation between transitional disk fraction and cluster age .",
    "we next consider photoevaporation driven by euv radiation from either the central star or nearby , massive stars .",
    "euv continuum radiation photoionizes the upper layers of a disk so that hydrogen recombination creates a diffuse radiation field that steadily evaporates h  slowromancap2@ gas from the disk surface ( hollenbach et al .",
    "1994 , clarke et al.2001 ) .",
    "once the inner disk has become optically thin to lyman continuum radiation , the direct uv field also drives a photoevaporative wind that drains the outer disk ( alexander et al .",
    "however , extreme uv photoevaporation only drives disk dissipation when the viscous mass flow through the disk becomes weaker than the photoevaporative flow , estimated by gorti & hollenbach ( 2009 ) as @xmath142 the stars hosting transitional disks in our test sample have higher accretion rates ( table [ table : stats ] ) .",
    "models of uv photoevaporation therefore indicate that it can not be responsible for clearing the holes in our test sample .",
    "finally , we consider fuv - induced photoevaporation , for which the gravitational radius is outside 30  au ( matsuyama et al .",
    "such a large gravitational radius is appealing as a mechanism of opening wide holes , but once more , we have a timescale problem with clearing the disk interior to the gravitational radius . for our reconstructed gm  aur surface density profile ( eq .  [ gmaurdens ] ) , the single e - folding diffusion timescale from 30  au is 1.7  myr  higher than the age of gm  aur and other transitional disks in taurus .",
    "furthermore , because the fuv - driven wind outside the gravitational radius is so much more efficient than viscous accretion inside the gravitational radius , fuv - induced photoevaporation tends to truncate disks rather than opening inner holes ( matsuyama et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "our final piece of evidence that photoevaporation is not responsible for the holes in our sample of transitional disks ( table [ table : stats ] ) is its inability to create non - axisymmetric structure : photoevaporative clearing proceeds evenly outward from the gravitational radius .",
    "photoevaporation therefore does not set up the confined accretion flow necessary to move mass efficiently through an optically thin hole .",
    "multiple planets provide the only disk - clearing mechanism that can simultaneously account for the wide inner holes , high accretion rates , confinement of hot gas , and asymmetry observed in transitional disks .",

    "to calculate the rate at which disk material accretes onto the star , we consider the surface density diffusion equation ( pringle 1981 ) : @xmath149 , \\label{diffusion}\\ ] ] in which @xmath150 is the surface density of disk material , @xmath151 is the distance from the star , @xmath152 is time , and @xmath19 is the kinematic viscosity of the disk material . over a small region of the disk , one can approximate the diffusion rate by assuming a constant viscosity so that the diffusion equation can be separated into a time component and a space component : @xmath153 @xcite and @xcite also used disks with constant kinematic viscosity in their analytical and numerical studies of planet migration . by taking the partial derivatives of the separated function @xmath154 , we rewrite the diffusion equation as @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are partial derivatives over @xmath152 and",
    "@xmath151 , respectively , and @xmath75 is the constant eigenvalue .",
    "the solution to the time - dependent portion of equation [ eigen ] is @xmath158    to find an expression for @xmath75 that is benchmarked against measured t - tauri star accretion rates and does not depend on assumptions about viscosity , we examine the mass flow through the interior disk . for an interior disk annulus of finite size such as the one left behind by a gap - clearing planet , one may approximate the total mass transfer through the annulus , @xmath138 , as @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the inner edge of the gap created by the planet .",
    "the negative sign reflects the convention that material flowing inward creates a positive accretion rate onto the star .",
    "substituting @xmath161 into equation [ sigmadotapprox ] and solving for @xmath75 , we find @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the average surface density in the diffusing region @xmath164 .    using equation [ lambdasolved ] , we may write the solution to the diffusion equation under the assumption of constant viscosity as @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the accretion rate at @xmath167 . here",
    "the diffusion timescale we recover is similar to the canonical value @xmath168 ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) , but in terms of the accretion rate : @xmath169 the quantity @xmath170 is , of course , equivalent to the disk mass @xmath64 contained inside a circle of radius @xmath160 , so we rewrite equation [ tdiff ] to get equation [ difftime ] in  [ oneplanet ] .    for disks with @xmath171 , as is usually inferred from sub - mm observations , the diffusion timescale from equation [ difftime ] is linearly proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "a standard @xmath31-viscosity disk model with steady - state mass transfer has @xmath172 so that the radial dependence of @xmath173 according to the traditional @xmath174 criterion is also linear . even though we have , for the purpose of clarity , based our derivation of equation [ difftime ] on a disk with constant viscosity , the linear dependence of @xmath175 on radius applies to a range of commonly used disk models .",
    "bodenheimer ( 1974 ) divides the evolution of a young gas giant into four phases .",
    "the first is a transient hydrodynamic epoch , in which gas at the planet s hill radius free - falls toward the center of the planet : the planet s rapid growth is driven by the runaway expansion of its hill sphere .",
    "the hydrodynamic epoch lasts about one free - fall time , @xmath176 years . for planets growing by core accretion , phase i encompasses the mass range of @xmath177@xmath178 . for planets formed by disk fragmentation , the characteristic phase i mass is much higher ( e.g.  clarke 2009 ) .",
    "planets in phase i accrete 100% of the material inside their hill spheres .",
    "gap opening begins during phase i at about saturn s mass , @xmath120 , and eventually halts the runaway growth of the planet , which is why we do not start our simulations with small planet cores and let them accrete : fargo s accretion efficiency parameter @xmath99 would suffer a dramatic drop during only the first 1,000 years of disk evolution .    at the onset of phase ii ,",
    "the young planet develops an interior pressure gradient that halts the free - fall of material at the hill radius .",
    "the planet then stays in phase ii , quasistatic contraction on the kelvin - helmholz timescale over about a factor of 20 in radius , for @xmath179 years .",
    "the planet s evolution during this period is similar to that of a protostar on the hayashi track .",
    "accretion during phase ii is limited by the disk s ability to deliver gas to the edge of the gap and by the strength of the planet s tidal barrier ( e.g. dobbs - dixon et al.2008 ) .",
    "`` leakage '' of gas across the tidal barrier is much more efficient at the beginning of phase ii , when the planet nearly fills its hill sphere : at this stage , material from the disk can fall directly to the planet s surface . as the planet contracts , the velocity of disk material entering the hill sphere increases relative to the planetary surface , so that accreting gas will orbit the planet in a circumplanetary disk ( papaloizou & nelson 2005 ) .",
    "mass transfer onto the planet is then regulated by the the diffusion timescale in the circumplanetary disk as well as the mass transfer rate through the protostellar disk and is extremely inefficient ( ward & canup 2010 ) .",
    "once the planet s interior reaches 2000  k , molecular hydrogen begins to dissociate , draining the thermal energy that maintains the quasistatic pressure gradient .",
    "the resulting supersonic collapse , which starts phase iii , takes only a few days and decreases the planet s radius by a factor of more than 100 , further limiting the planet s ability to accrete .",
    "we see that a young planet s accretion efficiency changes dramatically as it evolves . during most of the transitional disk epoch",
    ", the planet will be accreting through a circumplanetary disk whose mass transfer efficiency depends on the ratio of protostellar / circumplanetary disk viscosities and the size of the planet .",
    "the circumplanetary disk viscosity depends in turn on the density and temperature of circumplanetary material .",
    "since fargo is an isothermal code that does not treat the planetary interior structure , it much better suited for parameter studies of gap - opening efficiency in the presence of planetary accretion than physically realistic computations of planet growth profiles .",
    "because the accretion - limiting circumplanetary disk should be present and growing during most of the hole - clearing epoch , we are justified in assuming that mass transfer onto the planets is negligible throughout our fargo simulation .",
