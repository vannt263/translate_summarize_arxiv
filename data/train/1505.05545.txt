    "dwarf galaxies play a key role in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . within the framework of hierarchical formation , they are considered the first systems to collapse , supplying the building blocks for the formation of more massive galaxies through merging and accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , late - type dwarf galaxies ( dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies ) , with their low metallicity , high gas content , and blue colors , resemble the properties of primordial galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are the best laboratories where to study star formation processes similar to those occurring in the early universe .    because of their poorly evolved nature , dirrs and bcds where initially suggested to be young galaxies at their first bursts of star formation .",
    "however , studies of the star formation histories ( sfhs ) based on color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the resolved stars in a large number of dwarf galaxies within the local group and beyond ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) showed that these systems started forming stars as long ago as the look - back time set by the available photometry . in practice ,",
    "all of them were already active at least @xmath5 gyr ago , and , when the photometry was deep enough to reach the horizontal branch or the most ancient main - sequence turnoffs , or when rr lyrae stars were found , at epochs as old as @xmath1 a hubble time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this poses a major challenge for chemical evolution models of dirrs and bcds , which have to reconcile the low observed metallicity with the old ages , roughly continuous sfhs , and fairly high star formation rates of the most metal - poor systems .    since three decades , metal",
    "enriched winds seem to be the most viable mechanism to reconcile the high rates of star formation observed in starburst dwarf galaxies with their low metal abundances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "outflows driven by supernova explosions and stellar winds are in fact expected to play an especially important role in these systems , whose relatively shallow potential wells make them susceptible to wind - driven loss of gas and newly created metals ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice ,",
    "even the accretion of large amounts of metal - free gas is usually insufficient to explain the low chemical abundances observed in dwarf galaxies with very intense episodes of star formation , where the metal production is quite high .",
    "alternative models have sometimes been proposed , but never succeded in reproducing all the observed properties of starburst dwarfs .",
    "for instance , recently , a scenario that considers infall of primordial external gas , but does not include any outflow or galactic wind , has been proposed by @xcite to explain the observed properties of gas - rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , these models have proven to be successful in reproducing the gas fractions , chemical abundances and photometric properties only for `` quiet '' field dwarf galaxies , with recent star formation activity but not strong intensity episodes ( i.e. dirr galaxies ) .",
    "moreover , ngc1705 , as well as a few other starburst dwarfs , does show observational evidence of galactic winds @xcite .",
    "element abundance estimates in late - type dwarf galaxies are fundamental to constrain chemical evolution models . while h ii regions define the present - day galaxy properties , chemical abundances for individual stars or planetary nebulae ( pne ) offer a view of the galaxy chemical properties at earlier epochs , but are challenging outside the local group , where the most actively star - forming bcds are found .",
    "in addition to the evolution of elements in time , the spatial behaviour of the chemical abundances plays a key role in constraining dwarf galaxy models .",
    "the majority of literature studies indicate that , within the observational uncertainties , dirrs and bcds show nearly spatially constant chemical abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this could indicate that the ejecta from stellar winds and supernovae are dispersed and mixed across the interstellar medium ( ism ) on timescales of @xmath6 yr , but an alternative possibility is that the freshly synthesized elements remain unmixed with the surrounding interstellar medium and reside in a hot @xmath7 k phase or a cold , dusty , molecular phase @xcite .",
    "ngc  1705 is a late - type dwarf galaxy classified as bcd , famous for its high recent star formation ( sf ) activity and for the unambiguous evidence of galactic winds @xcite .",

    "fors2 @xcite pre - imaging exposures were taken in order to identify the pne and h ii regions selected to build the mask for our multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "we imaged ngc  1705 on march 25 , november 15 and december 1 , 2010 for a total of @xmath15 h. seeing ranged between 0.63 arcsec in march , 0.97 in november and 0.81 in december .",
    "observations were performed with the standard resolution collimator in the narrow - band filters filt500@xmath155@xmath1685 ( sampling the [ oiii]@xmath85007 emission line ) and oiii/6000@xmath1652 ( centered at @xmath17  , and sampling the continuum emission adjacent to the [ oiii ] line ) . the total exposure time was @xmath12.5 h for each filter , split into three subexposures .",
    "the images have a pixel scale of 0.25/pixel and a field of view of 6.8 @xmath18 6.8.    after bias subtraction and flat field calibration , we combined the individual images into a single frame for each filter using the drizzle task @xcite in the iraf environment .",
    "we normalized the images to account for the different filter widths , and applied a gaussian smoothing to bring them to the same resolution ; then we constructed a [ o iii ] continuum - subtracted image , which is shown in figure  [ o3 ] .",
    "the morphology of the [ o iii ] image resembles that in h@xmath19 already discussed by @xcite .",
    "the ionized gas presents a bipolar morphology extending out to @xmath1100 ",
    "( @xmath12.5 kpc ) from the galaxy center , and it is organized into thin filaments , loops , and arcs .",
    "the presence of `` cellular '' structures or cavities is striking , making the gas appear as `` fragmented '' at a global look .",

    "( @xmath150 pc ) .",
    "the ionized gas extends much further away than the optical image of the galaxy .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ rgb ] , where we overplot isocontours for a portion of the [ o iii ] continuum - subtracted image over a color image of ngc  1705 obtained combing wfpc2 images in the f380w ( @xmath1u ) , f555w ( @xmath1v ) , and f814w ( @xmath1i ) filters .",
    "the field of view is @xmath20 , i.e. just @xmath13% of the total field of view in figure  [ o3 ] . indicated",
    "are also some of the regions that we targeted for spectroscopy ( see next section ) .",
    "the figure shows a strong concentration of ionized gas organized in a sort of shell around the high surface brightness optical component of the galaxy .",
    "the central region of ngc  1705 , with the highest density of young star formation , corresponds to a zone of significantly lower [ o iii ] surface brightness compared to the surrounding shell .",
    "a few blue stars are observed in correspondence of some of the [ o iii ] knots : this is the case for s7 - 1 , for the double - peaked knot just nearby it , and for s8 - 1 .",
    "however , we will show in section  [ dd ] that , despite the presence of local association of young stars , the main ionization source seems to come from the central starburst in ngc  1705 .",
    "the [ o iii ] continuum - subtracted image was used to identify pn candidates and h ii regions . at the distance of ngc  1705 ( @xmath21 mpc or @xmath22 ,",
    "* ) , pne , with typical diameters smaller than 1 pc , should appear as point - like objects emitting in the [ oiii ] line .",
    "thus we selected point - like sources in the [ oiii ] continuum - subtracted image to identify pn candidates , although we could not exclude that these sources were compact h ii regions instead .",
    "pn central stars typically have absolute visual magnitudes of @xmath23 @xcite , corresponding to an apparent magnitude of @xmath24 in ngc  1705 , too faint to be detected in our continuum image .",
    "therefore , when selecting pn candidates , we also checked that no continuum emission was associated to the point - like sources in the [ oiii]-continuum subtracted image . following these criteria , we identified 17 pn candidates in the frame , whose positions are indicated in figure  [ o3 ] .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained with fors2 in the mxu configuration from january 2011 until january 2012 in service mode .",
    "the slit mask ( see figure  [ o3 ] ) , was constructed to observe the largest possible number of pn candidates , giving priority to the brightest ones .",
    "we were able to target 9 out of the 17 identified candidates ( slit number s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s11 , s12 , s13 , s14 ) .",
    "two slits ( s7 and s8 ) were positioned on h ii regions observed by @xcite , while three slits ( s6 , s9 , and s10 ) were positioned on extended [ o iii ] emission regions and gas filaments .",
    "we also positioned six slits on regions where no diffuse gas emission was observed , to serve as sky templates .",
    "these were used to subtract the background in those slits totally occupied by the emission . to avoid confusion ,",
    "the sky slits are not shown in the mask of figure  [ o3 ] .    to cover the spectral range from the [ o iii]@xmath83727 to the [ s ii]@xmath256716,31 doublet the grism gris@xmath15300v was employed , alone in the blue , and coupled with the gg435 filter in the red .",
    "ngc  1705 was observed in the blue with 7@xmath182700 s exposures , for a total of 5.2 h , and in the red with 20@xmath182700 s exposures , for a total of @xmath115 h. the seeing varied from @xmath10.7  to @xmath11.3 ",
    "( median value of 1.1  ) for the blue observations , and from @xmath10.6  to 1.5  ( median value of 0.9  ) for the red observations , higher than our requirement of a seeing @xmath260.8  . the pixel scale and the dispersion are 0.126 arcsec / pixel and @xmath12  / pixel , respectively .",
    "the effective resolution is @xmath27 at @xmath28    .",
    "wavelength calibration was based on four arc lamps ( a he , a hgcd , and two ar arc lamps ) to provide a sufficient number of lines over the whole spectral range .",
    "data were reduced with the standard procedure using the _ onedspec _ and _ twodspec _ packages inside iraf .",
    "the science and arc frames were bias subtracted . for each science exposure ,",
    "the individual 2d spectra were extracted from the frame .",
    "the exact same extraction apertures used for the science frames were used for the arc frames .",
    "then , the 2d spectra were wavelength calibrated using the longslit _ identify _ , _ fitcoords _ and _ transform _ tasks .",
    "after that we subtracted the background .",
    "this step deserves a particular explanation : in the case of point - like sources ( pn candidates or compact h ii regions ) , we defined the background using two windows at the opposite sides of the central source , and performed the subtraction with the _ background _ task in iraf .",
    "typically , the background windows were chosen at a distance larger than @xmath1 2 times the fwhm of the spatial profile from the source peak .",
    "this procedure removes both the sky emission and the background emission from ngc  1705 .",
    "however , in presence of extended emission occupying the entire slit , it was not possible to define the background windows ; then , we subtracted the sky templates from the object spectra .",
    "notice that this procedure allows to subtract the sky emission but does not remove the galaxy background .",
    "we applied the sky template subtraction to slits number 6 , 8 , 9 and 10 .",
    "for all the other slits we used the iraf `` background '' task .",
    "after background subtraction , the individual exposures were combined into a median 2d spectrum , for the blue and for the red observations separately . then",
    "1d spectra were extracted using the _ apall _ task . in the case of pn candidates ,",
    "we centered the extraction aperture on the point - like source , while in the case of extended emission , multiple apertures were selected within one slit ( e.g. , apertures s6 - 1 , s6 - 2 , s7 - 1 , s7 - 2 , s8 - 1 , s8 - 2 , s8 - 3 , s8 - 4 , see figure  [ o3bis ] ) .    the 1d spectra were flux calibrated using the spectrophotometric standard stars feige  56 , gd  108 , ltt  3218 , ltt  4816 , and feige  110 , eg  21 , ltt  1020 , ltt  2415 , ltt  3218 , respectively for the blue and for the red observations .",
    "the standards were observed with a 5 arcsec wide slit positioned at the center of the mos instrument .",
    "after bias subtraction , wavelength calibration , and background removal , a 1d spectrum was extracted for each standard . to obtain the sensitivity function we ran the iraf tasks _ standard _ and",
    "_ sensfunc_. the _ standard _ task provides the standard star observed counts , along with the associated calibration fluxes , over some pre - defined bandpasses .",
    "then the _ sensfunc _ uses the _ standard _",
    "output to determine the system sensitivity as a function of wavelength . in the process of deriving the sensitivity curve",
    ", we assumed the atmospheric optical extinction curve derived by @xcite for cerro paranal .",
    "the _ calibrate _ task was run to obtain flux calibrated spectra .",
    "the spectra obtained with the blue ( gris@xmath15300v ) and red ( gris@xmath15300v@xmath16gg435 ) configurations are shown in figures  [ spectra1 ] , [ spectra2 ] , [ spectra3 ] and [ spectra4 ] .",
    "we do not show the regions below @xmath13600   and below @xmath14500   for the blue and red spectra , respectively , because the instrumental sensitivity curves significantly decrease below these wavelengths and are very uncertain .",
    "also , below @xmath13600  , the atmospheric transmission is low .",
    "[ spectra1 ] to [ spectra4 ] show that the blue spectra extend up to @xmath17000    and , in some cases , even redder .",
    "the red spectra always cover wavelengths redder than 7000  .",
    "the agreement in flux between the red and blue spectra is excellent , with the only exception of the region below @xmath15000  , due to the higher uncertainty of the sensitivity curve in the red configuration below these wavelengths .    with the calibrated spectra in hands , we were able to asses the nature of our pn candidates .",
    "unfortunately , almost the totality of them turned out to be background objects .",
    "in particular , the targets in slit s1 , s2 , s11 , s12 and s14 show just one prominent emission line around @xmath15000  , and no ( or very weak ) stellar continuum , and are likely to be ly@xmath19 emitting galaxies at @xmath29 .",
    "the target in slit s14 also shows another prominent line at @xmath30  , identified as the c iv @xmath81539 line at @xmath29 .",
    "the targets in s3 and s13 are two background galaxies at @xmath31 .",
    "the object in s4 is likely a qso .    at this point",
    "we are left only with the pn candidate in s5 . some specific lines and line ratios",
    "can be used to discriminate between compact h ii regions and pne .",
    "for instance , an he ii @xmath84686 emission exceeding a few percent of h@xmath32 unquestionably indicates a pn ; also , [ o iii]@xmath85007/h@xmath32 ratios larger than @xmath1 4 are found only in pne ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . from the blue spectrum of s5 ,",
    "the [ o iii]@xmath85007/h@xmath32 ratio is @xmath13.4 , lower than what typically observed in pne , but still consistent with a low - ionization pn classification ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , due to the low signal - to - noise , the detection of the he ii @xmath84686 line in s5 is challenging .",
    "for this reason , we performed some statistical analysis on the bidimensional spectrum in order to asses the presence of the line , and in case , the significance of the detection .",
    "more specifically , we derived the average counts in 6 @xmath18 7 px@xmath33 boxes centered on the line and on different regions of the background .",
    "the significance of the detection was computed as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the average counts for the line and for the background , respectively , and @xmath37 is the standard deviation of the background computed from the different measurements .",
    "we obtain that the he ii @xmath84686 line is detected at @xmath13 sigma . from the 1d blue and red spectra",
    "( see next section ) , we measure he ii @xmath84686/h@xmath32 ratios of 0.28@xmath10.11 and 0.35@xmath10.14 , respectively .",
    "concluding , there is a significant possibility that s5 is a low - excitation pn .",
    "emission line fluxes were derived with the _ deblend _ option available in the _ splot _ iraf task .",
    "we used this function to fit single lines , group of lines , or blended lines .",
    "lines were fitted with gaussian profiles , treating the centroids and the widths as free parameters . in presence of blended lines we forced the lines to have all the same widths .",
    "the continuum was defined choosing two continuum windows to the left and to the right of the line or line complex , and fitted with a linear regression .",
    "the final emission fluxes were obtained repeating the measurement several times with slightly different continuum choices , and averaging the results .",
    "the errors were derived from the standard deviation of the different measurements .",
    "the emission line measurements for the blue and red spectra are given in tables  1 and 2 .",
    "the errors , which in the case of bright lines can be very small ( even lower than @xmath11% ) , do not account for flux calibration errors or for other systematic uncertainties .",
    "a comparison between the fluxes measured for the lines in common between the blue and red spectra provides more realistic errors : the differences are typically within @xmath14% for the brightest lines , and within @xmath110% for the faintest lines .",
    "particular attention was paid to the correction of the emission lines for balmer absorption due to the underlying ngc  1705 s stellar population .",
    "balmer absorption lines are visible in our spectra as absorption wings in correspondence of the h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 , and h@xmath32 emission lines , while no absorption wings are visible in the h@xmath19 region due to the blend with the [ n ii]@xmath86548,84 emission lines .",
    "we attempted a fit of the absorption wings in order to recover the full strength of the balmer absorption lines , but these were not deep enough to allow for a `` stable '' solution : the resulting absorption strengths were highly dependent on the particular choice of the input parameters ( for instance , the windows for the continuum evaluation ) .",
    "thus we adopted a different approach than a direct spectral fit to all the regions .",
    "more specifically , we selected a specific region in ngc  1705 with the minimum possible contribution of the emission with respect to the underlying stellar absorption ( and with the deepest absorption wings ) , determined the corrections directly from its spectrum , and then extended the derived corrections to other regions of ngc  1705 using population synthesis models . in the following subsections",
    "we describe in details the three different steps of our semi - empirical approach : a ) derivation of the absorption lines from an empirical spectrum in a region of ngc  1705 ; b ) comparison with predictions from population synthesis models ; c ) extension of the correction to all regions in ngc  1705 through population synthesis models .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible from our data to extract an emission - free spectrum with a signal to noise high enough to allow for a reliable characterization of the balmer absorption lines in ngc  1705 : in fact , all the slits positioned near the galaxy center , where the stellar surface brightness is higher , are severely contaminated by the strong emission from the ionized gas , while the galaxy stellar surface brightness is too low in more external regions .",
    "given the impossibility of working with an emission - free spectrum , we looked for a region with the highest possible strength of the absorption lines in comparison with the emission lines , to allow for a good fit of the absorption wings .",
    "this region is located between the two emission peaks at s7 - 1 and s7 - 2 ( see figure  [ o3bis ] , panel c ) , and we will call it region s7-a hereafter . the strong absorption wings around h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 and h@xmath32 in region s7-a are well visible in figure  [ balmer ] .    to compute the corrections , we adopted the same procedure adopted by @xcite for a sample of dwarf irregular galaxies : this consists in fitting the balmer regions first with a model constructed with both absorption and emission lines , and then with a model that assumes only emission lines ( see figure  [ balmer ] ) .",
    "the correction is then computed as the difference between the emission strengths obtained with the `` emission only '' and with the `` emission @xmath16 absorption '' fits . in our specific case , we used the iraf _ splot _ task to fit the balmer absorption features with voigt profiles ( resulting from the convolution of a gaussian and a lorentzian profile ) , and the emission lines with gaussians , while the linear continuum was estimated from two windows located on both sides of the emission lines , away from the balmer absorption wings . for h@xmath38 and h@xmath32",
    ", we assumed a line in absorption plus a line in emission , with the peaks and the fwhms treated as free - parameters .",
    "instead , the more complex h@xmath39 region was fitted assuming two absorption profiles ( a gaussian for the g band around @xmath1 4300    and a voigt profile for the h@xmath39 in absorption ) plus two gaussians for the h@xmath39 and [ o iii]@xmath84363 emission lines .",
    "finally , the h@xmath19 region ( not shown in figure  [ balmer ] ) was fitted adopting three gaussians in emission for the h@xmath19 @xmath16 [ n ii]@xmath40 blend , plus a voigt profile for the h@xmath19 in absorption . due to the absence of visible absorption wings ,",
    "the parameters of the h@xmath19 absorption line were fixed : the absorption equivalent width was taken from population synthesis models ( see point _",
    "b ) _ in section 4.1.2 ) , and the ( lorentzian and gaussian ) fwhms were fixed to the values obtained from the fits to the h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 , and h@xmath32 lines .",
    "the `` emission @xmath16 absorption '' fits are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ balmer ] , and the results are given in columns 2 and 3 of table  3 .",
    "the values were obtained repeating the fitting procedure several times , and computing average values and standard deviations .",
    "the absorption strengths for the h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 and h@xmath32 lines are @xmath41  , @xmath42  , and @xmath43  , respectively .",
    "the `` emission only '' fits are instead shown in the top panels of figure  [ balmer ] , and the results are given in column 4 of table  3 .",
    "for each line , the final correction ( column 5 ) was computed as the difference between the emission equivalent widths obtained with the `` emission only '' and `` emission @xmath16 absorption '' fits .",
    "we notice that the corrections are lower than the full strength of the balmer absorption lines ; this is because the absorption lines are wider than the emission ones , with the consequence that only part of the absorption affects the emission line ( see figure  [ balmer ] ) .",
    "we obtain corrections of 4.0 @xmath44 0.2  , 4.5 @xmath44 0.3  , 3.1 @xmath44 0.4  , and 1.5 @xmath44 0.6   to the equivalent widths in h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 , h@xmath32 , and h@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "our values are higher than the average correction of 1.59@xmath440.56   to h@xmath32 derived by @xcite for their sample of dwarf irregular galaxies , and also higher than the constant 2   correction usually applied in the literature to all balmer lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , our correction to the h@xmath32 line is roughly twice as high as that in h@xmath19 .",
    "thus , applying the same correction to h@xmath32 and h@xmath19 may lead to significant uncertainties in reddening estimates , in particular if the emission lines are weak .",
    "we also notice from table  3 that there are non negligible corrections to the [ o iii]@xmath84363 , [ n ii]@xmath45 , and [ n ii]@xmath46 lines ( 0.9 @xmath44 0.1  , 0.5 @xmath44 0.1  , and 0.5 @xmath44 0.1  , respectively ) , whereas such lines are usually not corrected in the literature .",
    "since our results are based on fits to the absorption wings rather than on direct measurements of the balmer absorption lines , we performed a consistency - check with population synthesis models . to this purpose",
    ", we used the results by @xcite , hereafter a03 , and @xcite , hereafter a09 , who derived the star formation history ( sfh ) in different regions of ngc  1705 ( regions 7 to 0 from the center outwards ) from the cmds of the resolved stars @xcite . from a comparison of our fors2-mxu slit mask in figure  [ o3bis ] with wfpc2 images of ngc  1705 ( see figure  2 in a09 ) , we find that region s7-a defined in section  4.1.1 is located within region  5 of a09 .",
    "we thus compare our fits to the empirical spectrum in s7-a ( see section  4.1.1 ) with population synthesis models based on the sfh from a03 and a09 for region  5 .    in order to construct the synthetic spectrum , simple stellar populations ( ssps ) from the padova group for a metallicity of @xmath47 , based on the tracks of @xcite ( see also",
    "* ) , were combined according to the sfh of region 5 in ngc  1705 .",

    "* ) .    from the comparison of the ngc  1705 data with models in figure  [ bpt ]",
    "we can draw the following conclusions .",
    "first , the emission line ratios measured in regions s5 to s10 are below the msl in all the a ) , b ) , and c ) diagnostic diagrams , implying that the emission lines can in principle be explained with pure stellar photoionization . furthermore",
    ", a major contribution from shock excitation can be excluded on the basis of diagrams b ) and c ) , where the data show few or no overlap with the shock models .",
    "indeed , the data completely avoid the shock grids in the @xmath122/h\\beta$ ] versus @xmath126/h\\alpha$ ] diagrams , where stellar photoionization and shock excitation are best separated ( but notice that the most external regions s5 , s6 - 1 , s6 - 2 , s9 , and s10 are missing in this diagram ) .",
    "of course , we can not exclude a minor contribution from shocks projected on relatively stronger stellar photoionized regions .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that our data are biased toward stellar photoionization , and that shock - dominated zones are actually present in ngc  1705 ; in fact , non - radiative ionization is typically confined to regions of low h@xmath19 surface brightness , as observed by many authors who studied the occurrence of shocks in star forming galaxies @xcite , while our slits were positioned in regions of relatively high [ o iii ] ( and h@xmath19 ) surface brightness in order to obtain spectra with a good signal - to - noise .",
    "indeed , the presence of a kiloparsec - scale supershell of ionized gas centered on the nucleus of ngc  1705 and expanding at a velocity of @xmath129 km @xmath121 @xcite suggests that shock excitation is a possible mechanism .",
    "the second consideration from an inspection of the diagrams in figure  [ bpt ] is that the data tend to move from top left to bottom right in diagrams a ) , b ) and c ) ( decreasing @xmath122/h\\beta$ ] values and increasing @xmath124/h\\alpha$ ] , @xmath125/h\\alpha$ ] , and @xmath126/h\\alpha$ ] ratios ) with increasing distance from the galaxy center .",
    "we can exclude that this effect is due to dust extinction , given the very weak effect of dust absorption on the bpt diagrams and the low @xmath63 values derived for ngc  1705 ( see tables  7 and 8) ; we can also exclude a density effect , as that shown in @xcite for a sample of @xmath1 5000 h ii regions in the califa survey , given the homogeneously low @xmath73 derived for regions s6 to s10 .",
    "the behaviour that we see in figure  [ bpt ] has already been observed for other galaxies , and it is commonly explained with the gradual and continuous transition from the core of the h ii regions into the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the trend of the data from top left to bottom right follows that of the starburst models of ke01 with decreasing ionization parameter q. @xcite have shown that there is a strong correlation between position in the bpt diagram , metallicity and ionization parameter : more metal - rich h ii regions have the lowest ionization parameters , and are located in the bottom right part of the star - forming sequence , while low - metallicity h ii regions display the highest ionization parameters and are located top left . however , in the case of ngc  1705 , the observed trend from top left to bottom right in the bpt diagram with increasing galactocentric distance goes in the opposite direction , being associated to a decrease in metallicity as derived by the direct @xmath75 method . in this context , the observed gradual decrease in the ionization parameter could be explained with the dilution of radiation from a centralized source with increasing distance from the main star forming regions .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath122\\lambda5007/[o ii]\\lambda3727 $ ] versus @xmath124\\lambda\\lambda6548,84/[o ii]\\lambda3727 $ ] diagram provides an optimal separation between the ionization parameter and the chemical abundance .",
    "this diagram is shown in panel d ) of figure  [ bpt ] , where the ngc  1705 data have been plotted against the ke01 starburst models for metallicities of 0.2 and 0.5 solar . in this metallicity range ,",
    "the @xmath122\\lambda5007/[o ii]\\lambda3727 $ ] ratio is almost independent of metallicity and decreases with decreasing ionization parameter q. for the plotted models , the data span ionization parameters from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , with the most internal regions ( s8 - 1 , s8 - 2 ) having the largest q values , and the most external ones ( s6 - 1 , s9 ) corresponding to the lowest q values . to better show this radial trend ,",
    "we have plotted in figure  [ ion ] the @xmath122\\lambda5007/[o ii]\\lambda3727 $ ] ratio against the projected distance of regions s5 to s10 from the galaxy center .",
    "this plot suggests a well defined decreasing trend of the ionization parameter with increasing distance from the galaxy center , with regions s6 - 2 and s10 as outliers .",
    "this trend indicates that the main ionizing source is located within the central @xmath16.6 arcsec ( @xmath1160 pc ) , which is the distance of region s8 - 1 from the galaxy center , and that the diluted radiation from this centralized source is able to ionize the gas out to at least @xmath132.8 arcsec ( @xmath1800 pc , the distance of region s6 - 1 ) .",
    "indeed , figure  [ rgb ] shows that the high surface brightness optical component of ngc  1705 , where the young starburst is concentrated , is well within our innermost region s8 - 1 .",
    "young blue stars are found in correspondence of two of our targeted h ii regions , i.e. regions s7 - 1 and s8 - 1 . through a comparison with the map of stars younger than @xmath15 myr derived from the cmds in @xcite , figure  14",
    ", we ascertained that these stars are indeed young enough to be able to ionize the gas .",
    "nevertheless , the trend of the ionization parameter with distance from the galaxy center suggests that the main ionizing source is the most central starburst , or perhaps the super star cluster ( ssc ) , in ngc  1705 , and that local association of young stars likely contribute to a minor extent .",
    "regions s6 - 2 and s10 , which deviate from the global decreasing trend ( notice however the particularly large errors in their measured line ratios ) , could be affected by different excitation mechanisms than pure stellar photoionization in a larger amount .",
    "we compared our results with the work of @xcite who derived chemical abundances for h ii regions in ngc  1705 .",
    "lee et al .",
    "obtained long - slit spectra with the efosc2 instrument on the 3.6 m telescope at eso la silla observatory for 16 h ii regions , and detected the [ o iii]@xmath84363 line in five of them .",
    "there are a few h ii regions in common with our sample , namely region s8 - 1 ( their a1 ) and region s7 - 1 ( their region c1 ) ; our regions s8 - 2 and s8 - 3 partially overlap with their regions a2 and a3 , respectively . among the regions in common ,",
    "the [ o iii]@xmath84363 is detected only in region a3 , while for regions a1 and c1 lee et al .",
    "provide an upper limit for the flux .",
    "for region a3 , our oxygen abundance is @xmath132 , while they obtain @xmath133 , which is consistent with our results within 3@xmath134 errors . for regions s8 - 1 and s7 - 1",
    "our oxygen abundances are @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively , while for a1 and c1 they provide lower limits of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "thus , while our result for region s8 - 1 is consistent with their abundance , our value for region s7 - 1 turns out significantly lower than their lower limit .",
    "for the five regions with detected [ o iii]@xmath84363 line , the average oxygen abundance by @xcite is @xmath139 , while our average oxygen abundance is @xmath140 ( see table  9 ) .",
    "however , we notice that all the five h ii regions in lee et al .",
    "are relatively close to the galaxy center , while some of our slits are located at much higher distances ; due to the evidence for a negative oxygen metallicity gradient in ngc  1705 ( see section  7.3 ) , we re - computed the average abundance using only the most central regions s7 - 1 , s7 - 2 , s8 - 1 , s8 - 2 , s8 - 3 , and s8 - 4 , and obtained @xmath141 , which is still @xmath142 dex lower than the lee et al.s abundance .",
    "we identified a few reasons for the discrepancy between our abundances on those by lee et al . :",
    "1 ) first of all , our temperatures are systematically higher than those derived by them ( their average @xmath86 is @xmath143 , while our average @xmath86 is @xmath144 for the regions in slits 7 and 8) ; our higher temperatures imply @xmath145 dex lower abundances . although both temperature estimates are based on the direct detection of the [ oiii]@xmath84363 line , we were able to detect this feature with a better signal - to - noise than lee et al . ,",
    "and thus we tend to consider our temperature estimates more reliable ; 2 ) in the second instance , we notice that the [ o ii]@xmath146/h@xmath32 reddening - corrected fluxes published by lee et al .",
    "are systematically higher than ours ( almost twice as high for regions c1 , a1 , and a2 in common with us ) , while the [ o iii ] fluxes are more in agreement with our values .",
    "their higher [ o ii ] fluxes imply @xmath1 0.1 dex higher ( total ) oxygen abundances .",
    "possible reasons for the discrepancy between the [ o ii ] fluxes are the drop in the instrumental sensitivity below @xmath14000    and the higher atmospheric extinction toward bluer wavelengths : systematic uncertainties in the determination of the sensitivity curve or in the atmospheric extinction function in this wavelength range could lead to significant differences in the estimated emission fluxes ; 3 ) finally , we notice that our @xmath147 temperatures are based on the @xcite relation , while lee et al . adopted @xcite ; the izotov et al .",
    "formula provides @xmath1 500 k higher @xmath100 temperatures , implying @xmath148 dex lower total oxygen abundances .",
    "we investigated how our results for ngc  1705 compare with the luminosity - metallicity relationship for other samples of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "our results are illustrated in figure  [ metallicity ] , where we plotted the absolute b magnitude ( @xmath149 from @xmath150 , corrected for galactic extinction @xcite , and ( @xmath151 @xcite ) versus our average oxygen abundance ( @xmath140 ) , together with abundance estimates for samples of dirrs and bcds in the literature . the solid line in figure  [ metallicity ] is the 3 @xmath134-rejection linear least squares fit to literature data , excluding ngc  1705 ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) .",

    "@xcite derived also abundances for nitrogen , neon , and argon . from their table  8 , we computed average abundances and standard deviations of @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) , @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) , and @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) ( see table  9 ) . averaging our regions s6 - 1 to s10 ,",
    "we derive instead mean abundances and standard deviations of @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) , @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) , and @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "we also derive a sulfur average abundance of @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "if we use only regions s7 - 1 , s7 - 2 , s8 - 1 , s8 - 2 , s8 - 3 , and s8 - 4 to compute the average abundances , we obtain @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) , @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) , and @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "thus , while our average central @xmath174 abundance is marginally consistent within the errors with that of lee et al . , ( the effect of their lower temperatures is partly compensated by their slightly lower [ n ii]@xmath86584 fluxes ) , our @xmath175 ratio is @xmath10.35 dex higher , as a consequence of our lower oxygen abundance .",
    "there is significant discrepancy also for ne and ar , since the lee et al .",
    "abundances are @xmath176 and @xmath10.28 dex higher than ours . for ne ,",
    "the particularly large difference is due to the combined effect of their lower temperatures and their @xmath1 50% higher [ ne iii]@xmath83869 fluxes .",
    "the authors themselves noticed the anomalously high ne abundances derived in their study .",
    "figures  [ elements ] and  [ nsuo ] , where we compared our abundances with literature values for different samples of late - type dwarf galaxies @xcite , show that our abundances for ngc  1705 are in very good agreement with literature trends .      since the @xmath19-elements ( such as o , ne , s , and ar ) are all synthesized by massive stars on similar timescales , the relative abundance of these elements is expected to remain constant , independent of the metallicity of the h ii regions .",
    "this has been observationally demonstrated by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is also shown in figure  [ elements ] , where we plotted the ne / o , s / o , and ar / o ratios as a function of total oxygen abundance for different samples of late - type dwarf galaxies .",
    "figure  [ elements ] shows that this trend is also valid within ngc  1705 for the different h ii regions : within the @xmath10.3 dex oxygen abundance range spanned by our data , the @xmath19-element ratios remain roughly constant with total oxygen abundance .",
    "the case of nitrogen is more complex since it may have a `` primary '' and a `` secondary '' origin .",
    "nitrogen which is produced only out of the original hydrogen in a star is referred to as `` primary '' nitrogen .",
    "the major contributors of primary nitrogen are believed to be intermediate mass stars in the range of 4 to 8 @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that primary nitrogen is produced in low metallicity massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "`` secondary '' nitrogen refers instead to nitrogen which has been produced from c and o originally incorporated into the star when it formed . in presence of a substantial primary nitrogen component",
    ", the n / o ratio is expected to be independent of the oxygen abundance . on the other hand ,",
    "one expects secondary nitrogen to become more and more important as oxygen abundance increases . indeed , this is what is observed : for very low - metallicity galaxies the n / o ratio is roughly constant at @xmath178 , suggesting a substantial primary nitrogen component .",
    "then , as oxygen increases , the n / o ratio starts to increase with o , suggesting a major secondary nitrogen component @xcite .",
    "we see in figure  [ nsuo ] that our h ii regions are in the regime where nitrogen has both a primary and a secondary component .",
    "the n / o ratios exhibit a significant scatter , with the more external regions in ngc  1705 ( see also figure  [ radial ] ) populating the upper envelope of the distribution of late - type dwarf galaxies .",
    "we illustrate in figure  [ radial ] the behaviour of the total oxygen and nitrogen abundances , and of the n / o , ne / o , s / o , and ar / o ratios , with distance from the galaxy center .",
    "while no gradients in the relative abundances of the @xmath19-elements are detected , the plot suggests a decreasing trend of the total oxygen abundance with increasing distance from the center of ngc  1705 .",
    "a linear least squares fit to the data provides the following relation : @xmath179 , which implies a radial gradient of @xmath180 dex  @xmath181 .",
    "this is steeper than what usually found in spiral galaxies and in the milky way ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the presence of metallicity gradients in late - type dwarf galaxies has been widely investigated and discussed in the literature .",
    "the majority of studies indicate that , within the observational uncertainties , dirr and bcd galaxies show nearly spatially constant chemical abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two possible explanations for the absence of significant metallicity gradients in these systems are that a ) the ejecta from stellar winds and supernovae are dispersed and mixed across the ism on timescales of @xmath6 yr , or that b ) freshly synthesized elements remain unmixed with the surrounding interstellar medium and reside in a hot @xmath7 k phase or a cold , dusty , molecular phase @xcite .",
    "detections of negative metallicity gradients from stars and h ii regions have been reported in the literature for the dirr ngc  6822 @xcite , with an oxygen abundance gradient of @xmath182 dex  @xmath181 .",
    "more recent studies based on spectroscopy of individual rgb stars have detected slightly negative gradients in [ fe / h ] for the smc , the lmc and the dirr wlm ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a very recent study by @xcite finds a correlation between h  ii region abundance gradients and surface brightness profiles in irregular galaxies : galaxies with a flat inner profile show shallow ( if any ) radial abundance gradients , while irregular galaxies with a steep inner profile show rather steep radial abundance gradients , in agreement with our result .",
    "finally , in figure  [ radial ] there is some evidence for larger n / o ratios in the external regions of ngc  1705 ( @xmath183 0.45  kpc ) , in correspondence of which no young stars ( age @xmath184 15 myr ) are found ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure  [ bursts ] in this paper ) .",
    "the n / o behaviour is a consequence of the decreasing radial oxygen trend , since the total nitrogen abundance does not show any definite trend , and it is consistent with a large scatter around a flat distribution .",
    "the innermost regions share common values ( at a 2@xmath134 level ) of @xmath185log(n / o)@xmath186  = @xmath151.34@xmath440.06 and @xmath18512@xmath16log(o / h)@xmath186  = 7.96@xmath440.04 , while the external regions appear characterized by lower oxygen abundances and higher n / o ratios , @xmath185log(n / o)@xmath187  = @xmath151.17@xmath440.07 and @xmath18512@xmath16log(o / h)@xmath187  = 7.82@xmath440.04 .",
    "a higher oxygen abundance and lower n / o toward the galaxy center may be the natural consequence of a burst in the inner regions sufficiently recent to have polluted the medium in oxygen but not yet in nitrogen ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario is consistent with the location of the most central ( @xmath188 0.45  kpc ) s7 - 1 , s7 - 2 , and s8 - 1 to s8 - 4 h ii regions , which are at the periphery of a region that has been forming stars during the last @xmath115 myr ( see figure  [ bursts ] ) , and that has consequently been enriched in oxygen .",
    "we will test this hypothesis quantitatively when the legus hst survey @xcite will provide more precise information on the recent star formation activity of different regions in ngc  1705 .",
    "this information will be used as an input to multi - zone chemical evolution models , thus improving upon the one - zone model approach adopted in @xcite .",
    "we also want to point out that the history of nitrogen enrichment in our galaxy is still poorly constrained by n measurements in stars , especially in the halo ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  3 , and references and discussion therein ) .",
    "therefore , the determination of n abundances in the gaseous component of low - metallicity external systems is of the highest importance to improve our understanding of n stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "we obtained [ o iii ] narrow - band imaging and multi - slit optical spectroscopy of ngc  1705 with fors2@vlt to infer chemical abundances for planetary nebulae ( pne ) and h ii regions and , more in general , to characterize the properties of the ionized gas .    from the [ o iii ] pre - imaging",
    ", the ionized gas presents a bipolar morphology extending out to @xmath12.5 kpc from the galaxy center , and it is organized into thin filaments , loops , and arcs , in agreement with previous studies in the literature based on h@xmath19 narrow - band imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it also exhibits `` cellular '' structures or cavities , with a typical cell size of @xmath150 pc .",
    "spectra in the wavelength range @xmath189",
    "  were obtained in the mxu configuration for some selected regions .",
    "we positioned the slits on planetary nebulae ( pn ) candidates , extended [ o iii ] emission regions , and gas filaments .",
    "nine out of the seventeen pn candidates identified from the [ o iii ] pre - imaging were targeted for spectroscopy . however , almost the totality of them ultimately turned out to be background objects , with the exception of one , which is a possible low - ionization pn",
    ". we were then left with five mxu slits positioned on the ionized gas in ngc  1705 out to @xmath11 kpc from the galaxy center . from those",
    ", we extracted spectra for ten apertures ( regions ) , plus the low - ionization pn .",
    "the auroral [ o iii]@xmath0 line was detected in all regions but the pn , allowing for a direct estimate of the electron temperatures .",
    "we derived the abundances of nitrogen , oxygen , neon , sulfur and argon out to @xmath11 kpc from the center of ngc  1705 .",
    "the lack of detection of the [ o iii]@xmath0 line in the pn , coupled with the low signal - to - noise of its spectra , prevented us from deriving any reliable characterization of the chemical properties for this object .",
    "we detected for the first time in ngc  1705 a negative radial gradient for the oxygen abundance of @xmath2 dex  @xmath181 .",
    "on the other hand , nitrogen exhibits a large dispersion around a roughly flat spatial distribution . as a consequence , the external regions ( @xmath183 0.45  kpc ) of ngc  1705 present larger n / o ratios than the central ones .",
    "these trends may be the natural consequence of oxygen enrichment in the central regions of ngc  1705 from the starburst activity occurred over the last @xmath115 myr , as derived from the cmds of the resolved stars .",
    "the average abundances and standard deviations derived for o , n , ne , s , and ar are : @xmath190 , @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) , @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) , @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) , and @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) , in agreement with values reported in the literature for other samples of dwarf irregular and blue compact dwarf galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "our average oxygen abundance is @xmath1 0.31 dex lower than previous literature estimates for ngc  1705 based on the [ o iii]@xmath0 line , while the @xmath175 ratio is @xmath10.42 dex higher .",
    "part of the discrepancy with other estimates of ngc  1705 oxygen abundance is due to the presence of the negative radial gradient .",
    "however , if we recompute the average o abundance using only the most central regions ( comparable in distance from the center to regions used in the literature ) , we obtain @xmath4 , which is still @xmath10.26 dex lower than the average abundance reported in the literature .    using classical emission - line diagnostic diagrams",
    ", we investigated the possible contribution from components different than pure stellar photoionization in ngc  1705 . a major contribution from shock excitation",
    "can be excluded in our analyzed regions .",
    "furthermore , the radial behavior of the emission line ratios is consistent with the progressive dilution of radiation with increasing distance from the center of ngc  1705 .",
    "this suggests that the strongest starburst located within the central @xmath1150 pc is the major ionizing source out to distances of at least @xmath11 kpc , and possibly even more .",
    "the gradual dilution of the radiation ( decrease of the ionization parameter ) with increasing distance from the galaxy center reflects the gradual and continuous transition from the highly ionized h ii regions in the proximity of the major starburst into the diffuse ionized gas .    in order to explain the observed element abundances in ngc  1705",
    ", we plan to run in the future new multi - zone chemical evolution models based both on the sfh already derived from wfpc2 data , and on the more precise information on the recent star formation activity that will come from the legus hst survey .",
    "in particular , we will quantitatively test the hypothesis that the presence of a negative radial gradient in the oxygen abundance , coupled with a flat nitrogen distribution , can be explained by the active star formation derived from the cmds of the resolved stars in the most central regions of ngc  1705 over the last @xmath115 myr .",
