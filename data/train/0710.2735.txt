    "the particle physics community hopes that the lhc will soon present it with the signal for the higgs ; but , it is to the ilc that we will have to turn to for establishing it as _ the _ sm higgs boson through a precision measurement of its properties .",
    "the dominant channel of higgs production at the ilc , _ viz . _ @xmath6 where @xmath2 is any light fermion , proceeds via the @xmath4 interaction with @xmath7 .",
    "the most general form of the @xmath4 vertex , consistent with lorentz  invariance , can be written as : @xmath8 \\label{eq : coup}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 s denote the momenta of the two @xmath10 s and , at the tree level in the sm , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in our analysis",
    "we assume @xmath13 to be real and retain terms upto linear order in other anomalous parts . in an effective theory ,",
    "the general structure of @xmath4 coupling can be derived from dimension  six operators .",
    "we choose to work with a higgs boson of mass 120 gev and consider its detection in the @xmath14 final state with a branching ratio 0.68 .",
    "furthermore , we assume the detection efficiency of @xmath15-quark to be 70% .",
    "we impose kinematical cuts designed to suppress dominant backgrounds . cuts @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) on the invariant mass of the @xmath18 system : @xmath19 , can be used to enhance ( suppress ) the effect of the @xmath20channel @xmath21exchange diagram .    statistical fluctuations in the cross - section or in an asymmetry , for a given luminosity @xmath22 and fractional systematic error @xmath23 , can be written as : @xmath24 we demand that the contribution to the observable coming from the anomalous parts are less than the statistical fluctuation in these quantities at a chosen level of significance and study the sensitivity of a lc to probe them .",
    "we choose @xmath23 = 0.01 , @xmath25 = 500 fb@xmath26 and look for a @xmath27 effect .",
    "note that in the case of polarisation asymmetries the total luminosity of @xmath28 fb@xmath26 is divided equally among different polarisation states .",
    "we construct observables ( @xmath30 ) whose behaviour ( odd / even ) under the discrete transformations @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( the pseudo time reversal operator which reverses particle momenta and spins without interchanging initial and final states ) is the same as that for a particular operator in the effective lagrangian .",
    "this is achieved by taking the expectation values of signs of various combinations of measured quantities such as particle momenta and spins , @xmath34 s , @xmath35 .",
    "some of these combinations are listed in table  [ tab : corr1 ] .",
    "the observables are cross - sections and various asymmetries with polarised beams and polarised final state @xmath0 s , which we discuss in the following sections and are also listed in the table .",
    ".[tab : corr1 ] _ various possible @xmath34 s , their discrete transformation properties , the anomalous couplings on which they provide information along with observables @xmath36 .",
    "symbol @xmath37 indicates that the corresponding @xmath34 s do not have any definite transformation property under @xmath38 or @xmath33 . here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is momentum of initial state electron ( positron ) and analogously @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the momentum of final state fermions ( anti - fermions ) . _ [ cols=\">,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath45 channel behave differently with increasing energy .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the energy dependence of the sensitivity of our observables to the anomalous couplings .",
    "we have also investigated the reach in sensitivity of clic to @xmath4 couplings at five different c.m .",
    "energies , namely at 0.5 , 0.8 , 1 , 1.5 and 3 tev . we found that going to higher energy can improve the sensitivity and best possible sensitivity , for example",
    ", for @xmath46 is obtained at @xmath47 = 1 tev , with r2-cut .",
    "this improvement is upto a factor of 2 as compared to the analysis made earlier for an ilc operating at 500 gev c.m .",
    "energy @xcite . at higher energies , however , both the initial state radiation ( isr ) effect as well as",
    "the effect of beamstrahlung which causes energy loss of the incoming electron ( or positron ) due to its interaction with the electromagnetic field of the opposite bunch , have to be further taken into account .",
    "corrections coming from both are sizable and change the rates .",
    "for example , at @xmath28 gev , the isr effects change the sm contributions by @xmath48 whereas the contribution coming from ( say ) @xmath49 changes by about @xmath50 ; with beamstrahlung at ( say ) 1 tev these effects are @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "however , the effect on the limits for sensitivity that may be obtained is less drastic as these affect both the sm as well as anomalous contribution similarly . at @xmath54 tev , for example , the above mentioned limit changes by @xmath55 .",
    "thus we show that use of polarised initial beams can yield higher sensitivity to @xmath46 , @xmath56 and to both the @xmath33-odd @xmath57 couplings .",
    "the limit on @xmath58 can be improved by a factor of 2 to 3 using @xmath0 poalrisation as well , even with pessimistic assumptions on the efficiency of the polarisation measurement .",
    "we also study effect of increasing energy on the sensitivity .",
    "for example , at @xmath59tev one obtains an improvement by a factor 2 , which further changes by about @xmath55 due to isr and beamstrahlung effects .",
