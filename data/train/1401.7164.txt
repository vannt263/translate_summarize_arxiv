    "the microscopic mechanism driving the liquid vapor condensation , characteristic of simple fluids , is the balance between isotropic short range repulsions and long range attractions that promote the formation of isotropic clusters of particles , which ultimately become macroscopic at the ( critical ) phase transition .",
    "the addition of short range directional attractions promotes the association of the particles in non spherical clusters that have a profound effect on the phase transition .",
    "these bonding interactions are designed in recently fabricated nanometer - to - micrometer sized particles , which self - assemble into a variety of complex structures @xcite . by patterning the surface of these particles , control over the anisotropic interactions",
    "may be achieved and the structure of the self - assembled clusters becomes tunable .",
    "the formation of ( large ) anisotropic clusters competes with ( and eventually inhibits ) the isotropic phase transition .",
    "thus , the design of patchy particles that self - assemble in predefined structures , requires the knowledge of their macroscopic properties .",
    "indeed , recent studies of the structural and thermodynamic properties of models of patchy particles have shown that the interplay between self - assembly and phase separation leads to unusual macroscopic phases such as empty liquids , optimal networks , equilibrium gels , micellar phases , etc . @xcite .",
    "patchy particle models with dissimilar patches ( of types @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) were introduced in this context @xcite , and studied thoroughly , using both theory and simulation , in the case where linear self - assembly dominates @xcite .",
    "the particles are endowed with two ( strong ) patches @xmath1 and one or several ( weak ) patches @xmath3 .",
    "whenever two patches ( one of type @xmath15 and another of type @xmath16 ) belonging to neighboring particles overlap ( or align ) , a bond @xmath17 is formed and the internal energy decreases by @xmath18 . by setting @xmath19 ,",
    "only @xmath20 and @xmath21 bonds may form and for systems with @xmath22 , the assembly of linear assemblies of particles connected by consecutive @xmath20 bonds ( chains or rings ) becomes energetically favored @xcite . if the @xmath1 patches are placed on opposite sides of the particle , ring formation is negligible ( or impossible in lattice models ) and the phase behavior is dictated by a peculiar balance between the entropic gain and the energetic cost of forming @xmath21 bonds ( compared to @xmath20 bonds ) @xcite . for a given entropic gain , there is a threshold in the energy cost above which no phase transition occurs . below this threshold , a phase transition between a gas of @xmath20 chains ( rich in non bonded @xmath1 patches , or ends ) and a liquid formed by a network of long @xmath20 chains connected by @xmath21 bonds or junctions ( and thus rich in junctions ) occurs .",
    "the liquid binodal of this phase separation is reentrant : on cooling , the density of the liquid at coexistence decreases and approaches that of the vapor .",
    "remarkably , the results predicted theoretically by wertheim s first order perturbation theory have been confirmed quantitatively by simulations of both off - lattice and lattice models @xcite .",
    "more recently , the phase behavior of variants of this model , which include more or less pronounced ring formation were investigated @xcite .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , it was found that the phase behavior on 2d triangular lattices , changes dramatically with the relative position of the @xmath1 patches : ( i ) when the @xmath1 patches are on opposite lattice directions , preventing ring formation , a reentrant phase diagram , as described above , is obtained in line with @xcite ; ( ii ) when the @xmath1 patches are on consecutive lattice directions ( at @xmath23 ) short rings are formed and no phase transition is observed ; ( iii ) finally , when the @xmath1 patches are on lattice directions at @xmath12 , a phase diagram with both an upper and a lower critical point is found .",
    "the existence of a closed miscibility loop was confirmed by @xcite , for an off - lattice model both theoretically and by computer simulations .",
    "close to the upper critical point the coexistence is between a vapor rich in ends and a liquid rich in junctions ; on cooling both phases become reentrant ( i.e. the vapor density increases and the liquid density decreases ) and become identical at a lower critical point . near this critical point ,",
    "the vapor consists ( mostly ) of isolated rings while the liquid is a network of rings and chains .",
    "moreover , the vapor has a lower energy and a lower entropy than the liquid .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a systematic investigation of the phase behavior of patchy particle fluids and their equilibrium structure , i.e. , the distribution of self - assembled chains , rings and networks . to that effect , we consider particles with two strong @xmath1 patches and ten weak @xmath3 patches , which is a generalization of the model studied in @xcite : particles are placed on the sites of a face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice with the patches aligned in the nearest neighbor ( nn ) directions . in the general model",
    "the position of the @xmath1 patches may be varied from @xmath24 to @xmath23 .",
    "the phase diagram is calculated , using theory and simulation , for several values of the model parameters .",
    "the comparison between the results provides a stringent test of the accuracy of wertheim s theory in accounting for ring formation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:3dmodel ] we describe the model ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] we describe the monte carlo techniques used to compute the phase diagrams ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we carry out the theoretical analysis ; in sec . [",
    "sec : results ] we compare the results obtained by theory and simulations ; finally , in [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss these and previous results and perspectives for future work .",
    "we consider an fcc lattice .",
    "sites on the lattice can be either empty or occupied by , at most , one particle .",
    "the particles carry two patches of type @xmath1 , and @xmath2 of type @xmath3 .",
    "each patch on a particle is oriented in one of the twelve different directions linking the site with its nearest neighbors .",
    "the angle @xmath9 between the two @xmath1 patches can take the values @xmath25 or @xmath12 - see figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "the model with @xmath26 was considered in @xcite .",
    "the interaction energy of two particles , @xmath27 and @xmath0 , is @xmath28 when they are nn on the lattice , and particle 1 has a patch of type @xmath15 directed towards particle 2 , and particle @xmath0 has a patch of type @xmath16 directed towards particle 1 .",
    "this configuration will be referred to as an @xmath17 bond . in all other cases ,",
    "the interaction energy is 0 .",
    "we set @xmath19 , in line with earlier work @xcite , and as a consequence , only @xmath20 and @xmath21 bonds are formed : @xmath20 bonds correspond to linear self - assembly ( in chains or rings ) and @xmath21 bonds to branching points or junctions .",
    "we choose @xmath22 to favor energetically the formation of chains and rings ; the number of @xmath3 patches corresponds to the available volume to form junctions , which are , as a consequence , entropically favorable @xcite .",
    "when @xmath26 rings are absent , and the competition for self - assembly of chains and junctions drives the re - entrant phase behavior described in the introduction and obtained in @xcite . here",
    "we consider @xmath29 , and self - assembly of rings ( defined as sequences of particles connected by @xmath20 bonds ) is expected to occur with impact on the phase behavior .",
    "chains are energetically unfavored and entropically favored relative to rings of the same size",
    ". ring formation will also affect the formation of junctions : when chains close to form rings , the @xmath1 patches saturate , and become unavailable to form @xmath21 bonds .",
    "the model under study is controlled by two parameters : @xmath4 , which sets the energetic cost of forming junctions or @xmath21 bonds ; and @xmath9 , the angle between the directions of the @xmath1 patches , through which ring formation ( the entropic cost of rings , to be accurate ) is controlled . in the following , we will compute and compare the phase diagrams obtained for different sets of parameters , @xmath30 : by decreasing @xmath10 the energy cost of forming junctions is increased ; by decreasing @xmath9 the entropic cost of rings is decreased and more and shorter rings are expected to form .",
    "we have carried out markov chain monte carlo simulations ( mc ) @xcite on the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the number of lattice sites can be written as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the number of times that the unit cell is replicated in each direction .",
    "a given site , @xmath33 , has @xmath34 states : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of orientations that a particle can adopt , point its patches to its nn sites on the lattice ; @xmath36 depends on @xmath9 . for @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "we @xmath39 , whereas for @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "the state @xmath42 corresponds to the site being empty .",
    "the gce simulations include two types of mc steps : single site moves , and multiple site moves using a cluster algorithm .",
    "a single - site move consists in updating the state of one site of the system .",
    "this is done by picking one site of the system at random ( with equal probabilities ) and selecting one of its possible states , with probabilities @xmath43 , that take into account the interactions of the site with its nn on the lattice and the values of the temperature , @xmath44 and the chemical potential @xmath45 : @xmath46 with @xmath47 $ ] , for @xmath48 ; @xmath49 is the interaction energy of the particle on site @xmath33 , in state @xmath50 , with the particles on nn sites ; @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is boltzmann s constant )",
    ".      the second type of moves works by inserting or deleting sequences of particles linked by @xmath20 bonds .",
    "the algorithm is based on the cluster procedures proposed in our previows work @xcite for the model with @xmath53 . in these moves ,",
    "insertion or deletion is chosen with the same probability , and then the following steps are followed :      \\(1 ) an occupied site is chosen at random ; the particle at that site is the _ root _ used to define the cluster of particles to be eventually deleted .",
    "\\(2 ) one of the @xmath1 patches of the root is selected to start growing the first branch of the sequence .",
    "if this patch is bonded to another @xmath1 patch of a nn particle , the latter is linked to the root ( added to the cluster ) with probability @xmath54 ( not linked with probability @xmath55 ) . if there are no @xmath20 bonds the particles are not linked . for links established in the previous step , we consider the particles added to the cluster , and check if they participate in any other @xmath20 bonds , applying the same probabilistic criterion to incorporate new particles to the cluster .",
    "the process stops when no new links are established or when the cluster closes on itself forming a ring .",
    "\\(3 ) the growth process ( 2 ) is repeated for the second branch ( through the second @xmath1 patch of the root particle ) .",
    "\\(1 ) a _ root _ particle is inserted in an empty position chosen at random , its orientation chosen from the @xmath36 possible states at random with equal probabilities .",
    "\\(2 ) one of the @xmath1 patches is chosen at random and then one start growing the cluster at this point , if the corresponding nn lattice position is empty then one continues the cluster growing with probability @xmath54 ( or stop it with probability @xmath55 ) by inserting a particle with one of its @xmath56 orientations that produce an @xmath20 bond with the previous particle ( @xmath57 for @xmath40 ; and @xmath58 for both @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "the growing process through this branch finishes either by the probabilistic rule given above or because the nn site to which the @xmath1 patch points to is occupied .",
    "\\(3 ) once the growth of the first branch finishes , the same procedure is applied from the second @xmath1 patch of the root particle .      taking into account super - detailed balance@xcite it is relatively simple to write down the ratio between the acceptance probabilities of mc moves involving two configurations that can interconvert , by inserting / removing a chain of @xmath59 particles connected through @xmath20 bonds .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be the number of particles in those configurations , with @xmath62 . by taking into account the probabilities of generating a given trial cluster in both the insertion and deletion attempts",
    "we obtain : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mc acceptance probability of the configuration with @xmath65 particles when created as a trial configuration from the configuration with @xmath66 particles ; @xmath67 is the difference of potential energy between the two configurations , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the number of possible links rejected by the application of the probabilistic criterion , during the growth process .",
    "the efficiency of the sampling procedure will depend on the choice of @xmath54 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath70 by considering the analogies of the current method with one of the cluster algorithms developed in ref . .",
    "the cluster algorithm and its implementation in the numerical codes was checked against calculations with single - site moves only .",
    "we found that the combination of the cluster and single - site algorithms improves the efficiency of the method .",
    "whereas at relatively high temperatures the single site algorithm can sample the phase space accurately , at low temperature its performance is rather poor . by contrast , the cluster moves allow an efficient sampling even close to critical points at low temperatures .      as in previous work on related models@xcite it is possible to build asymptotic models that capture the limiting behavior at low temperatures , when @xmath71 .",
    "the adaptation of the cluster algorithm to these models is achieved by forbidding configurations with non - bonded @xmath1 patches : the bonding probability is taken to be @xmath72 , and deletion moves are rejected if they lead to a non - bonded @xmath1 patch .",
    "the relevant reduced temperature is then @xmath73 $ ] .      in order to obtain an overview of the phase diagrams of the systems we used the following procedure : at fixed temperatures , we run simulations at different chemical potentials for small systems , @xmath74 . from these",
    "we obtain an estimate of the region in @xmath75 where liquid - vapor equilibrium is to be found , and an idea of the location of the critical points .    in order to compute the precise location of the liquid - vapor transition we coupled our gce simulations with thermodynamic integration ( ti ) and gibbs - duhem integration ( gdi)@xcite .",
    "ti is used to obtain , at least , one reference point @xmath76 on the liquid - vapor coexistence line , and gdi is used to compute the liquid - vapor binodals using as starting point that computed using ti .",
    "technical details of the procedures can be found elsewhere @xcite . in these calculations",
    "we used relatively large system sizes : @xmath77 , to prevent the failure of gdi due to the possibility of _ jumps _ between the liquid and vapor phases during the integration process .",
    "of course these _ jumps _ are expected to occur in the neighborhood of the critical points , for any system size .    in order to estimate the critical points we use finite - size - scaling techniques @xcite .",
    "the definition of the system - size dependent pseudo - critical properties , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( critical density ) and the procedure to estimate the critical properties in the thermodynamic limit can be found in ref . .",
    "the pseudo - critical temperatures are obtained as follows : after a rough location of the critical point in the @xmath75 plane we run preliminary gce simulations for a small system size , typically @xmath74 , and apply histogram reweighting techniques@xcite to improve the initial estimates of @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "once an improved estimate of the critical point is obtained , we run long simulations , and the results are used after applying histogram reweighting to compute the pseudo - critical properties for that system size .    the final results for a given system size , @xmath81 ,",
    "are then used to run the preliminary simulations for larger system sizes .",
    "typically we considered systems up to @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , whereas for @xmath85 we considered systems up to @xmath86 for the upper critical points , and up to @xmath87 for lower critical points .",
    "one of the most successful theories to describe the effects of self - assembly in the thermodynamics of fluids is wertheim s perturbation theory ( wpt ) @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the fluid is described as a mixture of species , each corresponding to particles that have a particular set of patches ( or bonding sites ) bonded .",
    "the free energy is obtained using a perturbation theory where the reference system is , usually , the hard sphere fluid , and the interactions that promote bonding are the perturbation , under the following conditions : ( i ) each patch can take part in one bond only ; ( ii ) two particles can connect to each other through one bond only ; ( iii ) the bonds are independent ( and thus loops and rings are neglected ) . the thermodynamic behavior and the equilibrium structure of models of patchy particles have been described successfully using this theory @xcite . for lattice models , like that under study , conditions ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "are respected by construction . on the other hand ,",
    "the independence of the bonds ( iii ) , breaks down , as the lattice introduces spatial correlations between the particles and thus correlations between the bonds .",
    "nevertheless , previous works have shown that these correlations may be neglected , as semi - quantitative agreement between the results of wpt and of simulations was observed , under very general conditions @xcite . however , wpt fails to account for the phase behaviour obtained by simulations when the relative position of the @xmath1 patches promotes self - assembly of rings @xcite . to account for the formation of rings",
    ", wpt has to be extended @xcite .",
    "this extension was shown to reproduce accurately the simulation results for an off - lattice model where the particles self - assemble into chains and rings only @xcite .",
    "more recently , the extension was generalized to systems where junctions are formed @xcite .",
    "the comparison with simulation revealed that the theory reproduces ( at least qualitatively ) the simulation results : the existence of two critical points , the re - entrant binodals , the change in the sign of the entropy and energy differences between the coexisting phases , etc .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical results with the lattice model simulations , over a wider range of model parameters , provides a much more stringent test of the theory , which as we will show becomes increasingly innacurate as @xmath9 decreases , i.e. , as the number of rings increases and their size decreases .",
    "the free energy per particle of a homogeneous system of particles with 2@xmath1 and @xmath89 patches is , @xmath90 where , @xmath91 is the free energy of the reference system ( the ideal lattice gas ) , @xmath92 is the total number density , and @xmath93 is the bonding contribution , calculated through the extension of wpt to include rings @xcite , @xmath94 here , @xmath95 is the fraction of unbonded patches of type @xmath1 , @xmath96 is the fraction of particles with the two @xmath1 patches unbonded , and @xmath97 is the number density of rings .",
    "these quantities are related to the number density @xmath92 and to the temperature @xmath44 through the laws of mass action , @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 are integrals of the mayer functions of two patches @xmath1 and @xmath3 on two different particles , over their positions and orientations , weighted by the pair distribution function of the reference system ; for lattice systems @xcite , @xmath102,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is boltzmann s constant ) , and @xmath103 is the volume of a bond . in lattice models ,",

    "the results depend on the parameter @xmath9 of the model , through @xmath112 .",
    "the ratio @xmath116 was calculated for @xmath117 and @xmath12 ( see figure [ fig : ringdist ] ) .",

    "both the theoretical and simulation results indicate the existence of a closed - loop liquid - vapor equilibrium for the three values of @xmath9 considered in this work .",
    "this happens for a certain range of values : @xmath120 , where the threshold value @xmath121 depends on @xmath9 . a second relevant conclusion that can be extracted from the finite - size scaling analysis of the simulation results concerns the nature of the critical points .",

    "[ fig : phdeab04120 ] we plot the phase diagram of the system with @xmath128 .",
    "there are several interesting features , similar to what was found in @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram exhibits a closed miscibility loop , with one upper and one lower critical point .",
    "close to the lower critical point , both phases are re - entrant , i.e. , the density of the coexisting liquid decreases and the density of the coexisting vapor increases upon cooling .",
    "there is semi - quantitative agreement between the upper and lower critical temperatures obtained from the theory and simulation , and qualitative agreement between the density of the liquid binodal , which is underestimated by the theory ( in line with the results of previous works ) .    in order to characterize the structure of the coexisting phases , we calculate 3 quantities at coexistence : ( i ) the fraction of particles in rings , @xmath129 ; ( ii ) the number of ends or unbonded @xmath1 patches per particle , @xmath130 ; and ( iii ) the number of junctions or bonded @xmath3 patches per particle , @xmath131 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : struct04120 ] , close to the upper critical point ( at temperatures down to @xmath132 ) coexistence is obtained between two phases with practically no rings ; the liquid is rich in junctions and poor in ends ( high @xmath133 and low @xmath134 ) and the vapor is rich in ends and poor in junctions ( low @xmath133 and high @xmath134 ) .",
    "therefore , coexistence is between a low density phase of short chains and a high density phase of long chains connected by junctions ( a network liquid ) .",
    "upon cooling , however , the structure of the vapor phase changes dramatically : @xmath135 increases and reaches @xmath136 , while @xmath134 and @xmath133 decrease to @xmath137 ; at @xmath138 the vapor is in practice an ideal gas of rings . on the other hand ,",
    "the liquid phase retains the network structure , albeit sparser , with longer chains ( decreasing @xmath134 ) and fewer junctions ( decreasing @xmath133 ) .",
    "the number of rings in the liquid phase continues to be , at these intermediate temperatures , negligible . finally , close to the lower critical point , @xmath139 in both phases .",
    "this means that the number of unbonded @xmath1 patches is negligible , and both phases evolve ( on cooling ) to a fully connected network of rings and chains ( connected by junctions ) : the liquid has more chains and fewer rings than the vapor .",
    "an interesting feature of the phase behavior ( revealed by theory ) is the inversion of the usual sign of entropy and energy variation between the coexisting phases . in ordinary liquid - vapor coexistence",
    ", the liquid has a lower energy and a lower entropy than the vapor : this happens close to the upper critical point .",
    "however , close to the lower critical point , these relations are reversed : the vapor , being , as described earlier , a gas of rings , has a lower energy and a lower entropy than the liquid .    in order to investigate the effect of decreasing @xmath10 ,",
    "the binodals for systems with different values of @xmath140 were calculated ( see figure [ fig : phd120 ] ) . as @xmath10 decreases , the closed miscibility loop shrinks , and coexistence is obtained in narrower ranges of both temperature and density .",
    "in fact , there is a threshold value @xmath121 below which no phase separation is found , and self - assembly becomes the only mechanism of aggregation ( both theory and simulation suggest @xmath141 for a system with @xmath14 - see figure [ fig : critprop120 ] and table [ table:1]- ) .",
    "this calculation also confirms that it is the energy cost of the junctions or @xmath21 bonds that drives phase separation and thus the critical points : if this cost is too high , no phase separation occurs .",
    "the value of @xmath121 ( i.e. the thresholds for the energetic cost of junctions ) will depend on @xmath9 ( see the next subsection ) and , presumably , on @xmath142 ( the number of @xmath3 patches ) .",
    "we have verified that the features of the phase diagram for @xmath128 revealed by figures [ fig : struct04120 ] and by the inversion of the usual sign in entropy and energy differences between the phases , are also present in systems with larger values of @xmath10 in the empty fluid regime , @xmath143 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : critprop120 ] , the temperatures and densities of both critical points for systems with @xmath14 are plotted as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "it is clear that in the empty fluid regime , @xmath140 , two types of phase behaviour are obtained : a closed miscibility loop for @xmath144 and no phase separation for @xmath145 .",
    "the agreement between theory and simulation for the critical temperatures is remarkable as noted earlier .",
    "both theory and simulation suggest that the lower critical temperature tends to 0 as @xmath146 .",
    "actually , the simulation algorithms developed in this work allowed us to attain reliable results at very low temperatures , and to simulate the asymptotic cases : @xmath147 ) .",
    "the theory underestimates the critical densities although both theory and simulation predict a density for the lower critical point that is almost constant , for values of @xmath10 that are not too low , ( see table [ table:1 ] ) and smaller than the density of the upper critical point . the latter increases with @xmath10 .",
    "for systems with @xmath148 and @xmath149 , theory and simulation predict the same type of phase behaviour : when @xmath143 the binodal consists of a closed miscibility loop and the phase separation is re - entrant close to the lower critical point ( see figure [ fig : phd9060s ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : critprop6090 ] , for @xmath148 , the theory underestimates the value of the threshold @xmath121 and the agreement between the critical temperatures is merely qualitative .",

    "the density of the upper critical point is slightly larger than the density of the lower critical point , while in the theory the opposite trend was observed .",
    "nevertheless the densities of the upper and lower critical points are not very different in the range @xmath150 , and hardly depend on @xmath10 , as illustrated in figure [ fig : phd9060s ] .",
    "the theory appears to fail badly for systems with @xmath149 : the results of figure [ fig : critprop6090 ] reveal that the theory does not distinguish between this system and that with @xmath148 , as almost identical results are obtained for the critical temperatures and densities in both cases .",
    "the simulation results reveal that the range of @xmath10 where liquid - vapor equilibrium is found is much smaller for @xmath37 than for the other two cases .    in order to investigate the origin of this discrepancy , we calculate , both by theory ( using the laws of mass action ( [ lma1],[lma2],[lma3 ] ) ) and simulation , several structural quantities as a function of density and temperature , for the family of models under study .",
    "the comparison between theory and simulation results for the fraction of particles in rings @xmath151 and for the density of rings @xmath97 shown in figure [ frg0 ] , tests the approximation of the partition function of rings , for all densities and temperatures , by that of a single isolated ring . in general ,",

    "again , larger deviations are found at lower @xmath9 : for @xmath149 it is clear that the theory underestimates the density of rings .",
    "the effect of the @xmath21 interactions is illustrated in figures [ frg0]c ) and d ) .",
    "the agreement of both @xmath151 and @xmath97 for @xmath14 is similar to that found for @xmath154 . for systems with @xmath149 and @xmath158 , however , the agreement at high @xmath151 when @xmath154 is lost : the theory overestimates @xmath151 and larger deviations are found at larger values of @xmath10 and lower values of @xmath9 .",
    "the same trends are observed in the comparison of @xmath97 shown in figure [ frg0]d ) .",
    "figure [ fjrho ] displays the theoretical and simulation results for the number of junctions ( or @xmath21 bonds ) per particle , @xmath159 , as a function of density at @xmath160 , for @xmath161 and for @xmath162 . in all cases",
    ", we found that the theory underestimates the number of junctions and that the disagreement between theory and simulation increases when @xmath10 increases and/or @xmath9 decreases .",
    "this deviation is even observed for @xmath26 , where there are no rings @xcite ; given that in similar off lattice models @xcite better agreement was obtained , part of the observed discrepancies may be traced to the correlations introduced by the lattice structure .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that for systems with @xmath14 and @xmath24 the theoretical and simulation results show a tendency to coincide at low densities .",
    "however , for @xmath148 and @xmath23 , large discrepancies between theory and simulation persist at low densities .    the deviations between the theoretical and simulation results for @xmath151 and for @xmath159 are consistent : the theory underestimates the number of @xmath21 bonds and thus allows the formation of more rings .",
    "this means that the competition between ring formation and branching is not captured quantitatively by the theory .",
    "therefore , the structure predicted by the theory , for systems with @xmath148 and @xmath149 , is different from that of the simulations and as a result strong discrepancies in the phase behaviour are found .",
    "we have shown , through the investigation of a patchy particle model on fcc lattices , both theoretically and by simulation , that ring formation promotes the appearance of close miscibility loops , with two critical points , as the result of self - assembly of a single component system where linear structures are energetically favored and branching is entropically favored ( but energetically unfavored ) . near the upper critical point , the coexisting phases consist of a vapor of short chains and a network liquid ( long branched chains ) .",
    "on the other hand , close to the lower critical point , the low density phase is a vapor of rings and the high density phase a network of chains and rings .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of the phase behavior of this model , by varying the relevant parameters : @xmath4 , the energy of branching ( relative to that of chaining ) and @xmath9 , the angle between the directions of the @xmath1 patches in a particle , which determines the entropic cost of forming rings .",
    "closed loops were found , generically , in a range of bonding energies , @xmath163 .",
    "the threshold @xmath164 increases as @xmath9 decreases : if shorter rings are promoted ( by decreasing @xmath9 ) , the energy cost of branching has to decrease ( i.e. @xmath10 increases ) to obtain phase separation .",
    "it was also found that , for @xmath165 , there is no phase separation .",
    "the general results are obtained both by theory and simulation . however , quantitative agreement between the two deteriorates rapidly as @xmath9 decreases , from almost quantitative for @xmath14 to merely qualitative for @xmath149 .",
    "we have also found that , as @xmath9 decreases , the theory tends to overestimate the fraction of particles in rings and to underestimate the fraction of junctions ( or ab bonds ) per particle .",
    "these deviations become more pronounced as @xmath10 increases .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy may be traced to the way in which the ab bonds are accounted for in the theory .",
    "it is known @xcite that the thermodynamics and structure that results from wpt is equivalent to that of an ideal mixture of tree like clusters : loops are absent and each bond formed decreases the number of clusters by one .",
    "the only loops considered in the generalization of wpt used in this work are rings formed by closed sequences of @xmath20 bonds : the formation of an ab bond is still assumed ( as in the original wpt ) to decrease the number of clusters by one . the different treatment given to the @xmath20 rings",
    "is justified by their lower energy when compared with loops of the same size that contain @xmath21 bonds . however , when @xmath9 is decreased , the entropic cost of forming a loop with @xmath21 bonds decreases ; one then expects formation of more loops of this type and an eventual failure of the approximation .",
    "the results of simulations seem to corroborate this idea .",
    "in fact , in systems where @xmath20 rings are absent and loops are difficult to form ( i.e. when @xmath26 ) @xcite , the possibility of forming @xmath21 bonds correspond to a decrease in @xmath121 .",
    "this happens since almost all of these bonds lead to branching of chains and not to loop formation .",
    "by contrast , in the work reported here , we found that , by decreasing @xmath9 , @xmath121 increases and that the number of @xmath21 bonds also increases . therefore , at low @xmath9 , most @xmath21 bonds form loops ; phase separation is driven by the @xmath21 bonds that lead to branching , and to form these in sufficient numbers , their energy cost has to decrease ( i.e. @xmath121 has to increase , as observed in the simulations ) .",
    "a quantitative investigation of the effect of loops with @xmath21 bonds in the phase behaviour of this family of models will be addressed in future work .",
