    "one of the most clear macroscopic manifestations of quantum mechanics is the casimir force @xcite : a tiny force , relevant at short distances , which appears on uncharged bodies due to changes in the zero - point energy associated to quantum vacuum fluctuations .",
    "quantum effects like casimir forces have become increasingly important as electronic and mechanical systems on the nanometer scale become more prevalent . in the last 10 years",

    "techniques for predicting casimir forces in general geometries are clearly needed if theory is to keep pace with the flourishing of experimental casimir data and the design challenges of future mems devices .    in this framework , accurate",
    "modeling of casimir forces in general geometries and for arbitrary electromagnetic properties of the uncharged bodies becomes very important .",
    "shape and geometry can strongly influence the casimir interactions .",
    "several theoretical techniques have been developed in order to understand the geometric dependence of the casimir force .",
    "these include the use of the argument theorem to perform explicitly the sum over modes @xcite , semiclassical and optical approximations @xcite , methods based on functional integrals @xcite and scattering theory @xcite .",
    "many of these approaches have a common root in the multiple scattering theory developed in the seventies @xcite ( see also @xcite for an updated review and applications to semitransparent bodies ) , and the evolution in the computational power allowed a precise numerical evaluation that involves , in general , the computation of determinants of infinite matrices .",
    "there are also full numerical approaches , as the worldline numerics @xcite , that has been applied to scalar fields satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions , or finite difference methods that evaluate the casimir energy from the two - point function of the electromagnetic field @xcite . as a consequence of this theoretical activity",
    ", we now have exact results for a variety of geometries that involve perfectly conducting shells : cylinder and sphere in front of a plane @xcite , eccentric cylinders @xcite , two - spheres @xcite , surfaces with periodic corrugations @xcite , casimir pistons @xcite , multibody interactions involving plates and cylinders @xcite or squares @xcite , objects of spheroidal or nearly - spheroidal shape @xcite , etc .",
    "some of these methods also apply to the case of imperfect mirrors .",
    "the casimir force between two conductor bodies with simple shapes is in general attractive and monotonically decreasing with the separation among conductors .",
    "thus , one might ask whether complex geometries might give rise to unexpected phenomena , such as non - monotonic forces . for more complicated geometries , however , full numerical calculations become extremely difficult and therefore it is worth to analyze alternative approaches .    in this paper",
    ", we explore a new numerical approach to compute the casimir interaction energy in a two conductor waveguide for arbitrary cross section .",
    "the idea is to combine a well known method for computing eigenvalues of the helmholtz equation , the point - matching technique @xcite , with the argument theorem to compute explicitly the sum over eigenfrequencies .",
    "our technique is first tested for geometries with known solutions and then is applied to new geometries .",
    "thus , in section [ method ] we will describe the new approach . in section [ ecc ] we validate our method against numerical results @xcite obtained by us in previous works . in the rest of the paper , we use our numerical approach to compute the casimir interaction energy for more general cross sections of the waveguide , as corrugated cylinders in section [ rack ] . in section [ elipses ] and [ parabola ] ,",
    "we explore the behaviour of the casimir interaction energy between outer conductors that have focal lines and a cylindrical inner conductor .",
    "concretely , section [ elipses ] shows the casimir interaction energy when a cylinder with circular section is placed inside an outer cylinder with elliptical section . in section [ parabola ] , the outer conductor is a waveguide with parabolic section .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we expose our final remarks .",
    "a two - conductor waveguide presents an interesting setup for the application of the point - matching technique .",
    "this technique has been widely used to solve eigenvalue problems in many areas of engineering science @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions are imposed at a finite number of points around the periphery of both conductors . under this assumption , and for a solution proportional to @xmath0 , the partial differential equation of the problem can be reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "the determinant associated to this system vanishes for some values of @xmath1 , the eigenfrequencies of the system , that can be determined in this way by searching numerically the zeros . in order to obtain the casimir energy , instead of computing each eigenvalue ,",
    "it is more convenient to use the argument theorem to perform the sum over all eigenvalues .",
    "let us consider a general geometry with translational invariance along the @xmath2axis ( as for example very long and parallel conducting shells of arbitrary sections ) .",
    "we will bear in mind the situation in which one conductor encloses the other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , although the method could be applied to more general cases .",
    "the casimir interaction energy for a system like this , composed of two conducting shells , can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the eigenfrequencies of the electromagnetic field satisfying perfect conductor boundary conditions on the surfaces of the conductors , and @xmath5 are those corresponding to a situation in which the external conducting shell is very large . throughout this paper",

    "this behaviour disappears for larger amplitudes , where the exact results show more pronounced peaks .    in section v we computed the casimir interaction energy between an inner cylinder and outer surfaces with focal lines .",
    "the motivation for looking at these configurations was to see whether there was a non trivial behaviour of the energy near the focus or not .",
    "for both cases considered ( ellipses and parabolas ) , we have found that the energy and forces are monotonic across the focal lines .",
    "this may be a peculiarity of the geometries with translational invariance considered here .",
    "we have also confirmed the existence of unstable equilibrium positions of the inner cylinder , that coincide with the location suggested by simple geometric arguments .",
    "the examples discussed in this paper illustrate the simplicity and power of this approach .",
    "we have used a straightforward version of the point - matching method , with a naive choice of the points on the curves ( note that in all examples we have chosen pair of points with the same angular coordinate with respect to the inner cylinder ) . for less symmetric configurations , and when the surfaces of both conductors are closer to each other , it will be necessary to consider grids with a larger number of points , and to optimize their positions . as in the applications to acoustic or classical electromagnetism , special care must be taken for surfaces with pronounced edges , clefts or `` handles '' , where the point - matching technique may not be accurate to determine the eigenfrequencies .",
    "it is certainly possible to go beyond the geometries considered here .",
    "still considering geometries with translation invariance along the @xmath37-axis , it would be possible to analyze waveguides with more than two conducting bodies .",
    "the generalization for non - perfect mirrors is also possible . for the case of scalar fields satisfying arbitrary matching conditions on the surfaces ( rather than dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions ) ,",
    "the generalization is relatively straightforward .",
    "however , for the electromagnetic field the calculation is more cumbersome , since in general it will be not possible to treat independently the te and tm modes .",
    "the point - matching approach can also be generalized to three dimensional compact objects .",
    "the starting point in this case would be the solutions of the three dimensional helmholtz equation , written in terms of an adequate basis ( products of spherical bessel functions and spherical harmonics ) .",
    "we expect these geometries to require much more computational effort , and a more sophisticated method to optimize the choice of the grid of points on which the boundary conditions are imposed .",
